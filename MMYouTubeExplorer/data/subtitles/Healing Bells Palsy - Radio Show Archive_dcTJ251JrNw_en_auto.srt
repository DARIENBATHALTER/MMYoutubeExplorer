decades ahead of what's out there now B

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
paly happens to be an example of this

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,879
and I say this because years and years

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
and years

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,000
ago the thought that

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,520
shingles the virus had anything to do

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,120

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,520
exist anywhere in medicine but yet

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,280
Spirit offered me the information and

19
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,519
going all the way back decades I was

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
helping people out telling them that

21
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,040
they Bel B's py was a shingles virus now

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,840
not every type of bell paly sometimes a

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,080
bell paly could be a stroke but that's a

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
different story that's different than

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,479
Bell's paly and there's different

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,119
symptoms so much many more different

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
symptoms that come along with it I'm

28
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:18,040
already jumping into the show this is

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,040
unbelievable So today we're talking

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,520
about Belle's paly now you know with my

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,720
shows um this is the only Health show

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,240
anywhere only El show anywhere that the

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,600
information is not from group like

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,960
interest groups in medical funding with

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,720
strings attached and BOS botch

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,520
research um internal Kickbacks persuaded

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,280
belief systems private panel of

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,280
influencers yeah does that stuff matter

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,000
to say does it matter to talk about yes

40
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,240
it does because there's always something

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,040
behind information that's even passed

42
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,920
down passed around in alternative

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,719
medicine and conventional medicine both

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,719
but even alternative to alternative

45
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,439
medicine and because just Bell's poliy

46
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,960
alone is going to get cast off it's like

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,439
genetic down the road as some kind of

48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,719
genetic thing meanwhile we know what it

49
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,159
is and we're going to talk all about

50
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,000
what it is and how you get it and

51
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,200
everything else this the only show where

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,319
the health information comes from Pure

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,000
untampered with clean a clean Source a

54
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,360
higher source a source that was given to

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
me at the age of four a gift that was

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,239
given to me I was blessed with and or

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
cursed with or cursed with that's how I

58
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,440
felt anyway when I first received the

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,239
gift and along the way I had my Tantrums

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,800
of course while dealing with the gift

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,200
but the gift is for you guys it's for

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,280

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,720
I think it was in the fall because I

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,120
remember the leaves on the trees I was

71
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,400
outside of Nature and the leaves on the

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,319
trees were turning the red you know the

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
maples were turning turning red and

74
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,200
orange

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,560
and those beautiful colors and the oak

76
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,000
trees were turning those beautiful

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,239
colors and I remember and I had this

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,799

Spirit mentioned that to me over the

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
years you know even a little bit before

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,720
that once in a while but didn't quite

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,519
get it cuz I I wasn't at that age where

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,400
I could understand certain things and

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,799
and and spirit said this gift this this

100
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,000
wasn't for you this isn't for you and I

101
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,159
was like what I this my mind mind was

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
blown spirit said this is for everybody

103
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,840
else this is for them this is for them

104
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,959
the people that you you're upset about

105
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,400
the people that you're upset about

106
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,680
because you see what's going inside with

107
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,400
them every day this is for them I was

108
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,759
like oh my God okay okay I get it I get

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,199
it and that just made it worse that made

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,400
it worse when you're younger but you

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,280
know but the whole point is the source

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,199
of information is is pure and tampered

113
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,800
with information in the medical field in

114
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,400
the medical world and we got to worry

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,520
about that isn't that sad isn't that sad

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
that we have to worry about that in

117
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,360
alternative medicine it's so sad I can't

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,440
even tell you it's so sad because

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,479
funding goes in certain places there's

120
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,560
there's belief systems so tied into so

121
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,400
many different the fabric and pieces of

122
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,400
the alternative medicine world it's it's

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,840
it's different it's not like it was not

124
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,919
like it was a long time ago not like it

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
was when alternative medicine was in its

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,080
it's in its its place and in the late

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,759
1800s early 1900s then mid 1900s and

128
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,199
then conventional medicine try to squash

129
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,560
it out like a bug and and and just

130
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,280
locked up conventional medicine locked

131
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,600
up every single chiropractor every I

132
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,000
mean that that was trying to break break

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,960
above and beyond every single home

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,120
homeopath and then the word quack was

135
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,400
designed for all the alternative doctors

136
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,280
in the 40s and 50s there were ostracized

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
they were

138
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,639
tortured they were they were and and it

139
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,440
was unbel believable what happened they

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,199
had to go run off to Germany and hide

141
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,759
and even that wasn't even a safe place

142
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,840
for alternative

143
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,479
practitioners it was unbelievable time

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,319
an unbelievable time an alternative then

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,560
alternative medicine had to fight and

146
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,280
had a fight for its right to to to you

147
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,120
know to hang in there and stay in there

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,680
conventional medicine wanted it squashed

149
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
like a bug put a lot of people in prison

150
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,479
a lot of PE can you believe that you go

151
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,880
to your naturopath you don't even know

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,440
how many naturopaths went to prison

153
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,280
before that naturopath because it's so

154
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,720
swept under the carpet it's unbelievable

155
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,319
how many chiropractors went to prison

156
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,520
for for nothing for doing nothing back

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,000
in the in the 20s and 30s back in the

158
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,440
40s you couldn't believe the

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
trail the trail of

160
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
Darkness that that occurred for

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,759
alternative medicine to fight its way

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,039
through and then when it finally did it

163
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,280
finally birthed and it finally

164
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,080
grew the world found a way to find

165
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,960
contamination to slip it in in

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,680
everywhere it could so the information

167
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,039
you don't know it's there studies and

168
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
financial stuff behind it that's

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,560
unbelievable like no other inconen of

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,080
course but in alternative now so it's a

171
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,280
fight what's out there on the internet

172
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,840
what's in books is it legit is it not

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,360
what's going on where's the studies are

174
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,240
the studies real is the thumb on the

175
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,360
scale and that's what's going on out

176
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,360
there and we're not going to let any of

177
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,440
that kind of get in the way of getting

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,720
the source that that I was born with to

179
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,759
give you the information and when it

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
comes down to Bell's policy it has to be

181
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,280
right it has to be

182
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
right and that's that's what it's about

185
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,319

know history I really love the real

190
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,400
history history that just is completely

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,440
buried and hidden and just you know

192
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,560
burned up and just turned to ashes I

193
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,120
just I love bringing the old history out

194
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,599
because if you don't know where you came

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,919
from you can't appreciate what you got

196
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,879
and right now we got unbelievable and

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,919
amazing freedom in Altered medicine but

198
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,639
we got some problems with a lot of the

199
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,960
information that's tossed about in it

200
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,639
and there's a lot of gems and jewes

201
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
incredible information in alternative

202
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
medicine and in conventional medicine

203
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,919
there's incredible stuff and good

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
scientists and great doctors incredible

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,720
doctors everybody it's never the

206
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,800
doctor's fault when it comes down to

207
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,800
information being passed around really

208
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,520
it's not the doctor's fault they care

209
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,479

someone's like when they're a doctor

224
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,479

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,920
when we go into The Healing Arts you

244
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,079

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,200
is s surgeons non-surgeons it's serious

246
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,000
stuff it's serious stuff because it's a

247
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,440
different line of work it's it's not

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,600
like oh I'm going to choose to go this

249
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,000
this way in life which is still

250
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
purposeful which is all the different

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,480
ways people have purpose is amazing the

252
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,120
way they go into life with purpose the

253
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
way everybody has purpose whatever job

254
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,360
they do it's

255
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,480
incredible it's

256
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,240
incredible but when it comes down to

257
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,600
people that are ailing there's there's

258
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,399
an emotional connection there's an

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
emotional connection when people are

260
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,079
suffering you guys know when you when

261
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,440
you're not feeling well there's there's

262
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:53,160
it it it tugs on the heart so the doctor

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,160
or the practitioner they have to they

264
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,200
have to be there for that even if they

265
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,760
don't have good bedside man or doesn't

266
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,360
mean they're not feeling it or it

267
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,279
doesn't mean they don't know because

268
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
they know they know they know you're in

269
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,200
pain they know you're suffering it's the

270
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,200
business they went into they see it they

271
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,839
feel it and there's something about that

272
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,320
it's something about

273
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,600
that and so yeah you see me H too you

274
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
wouldn't believe it it's like Anthony

275
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,200
William okay just up to like oh my God

276
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,279
what do you do

277
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,600
whoa okay and uh and that's the kind of

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,640
respect I have but I know the history

279
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,320
and I also know how contamination has

280
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,640
occurred within in and out of certain

281
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,959
information and there's great doctors

282
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,000
have to pick and choose and they have to

283
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,600
pull those gems and jewels out they even

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,720
know they even know there's stuff going

285
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,880
on with information out there so that's

286
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,160
my little monologue to start with before

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,399
we before we get going um thyroid

288
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,560
healing what do you think are are you

289
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,399
going to are you going to get thyroid

290
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,560
healing because when you get it you are

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:02,160
going to be so psyched you're going to

292
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,160
be so psyched I mean seriously um I I I

293
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,839
I

294
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,399
painstakingly took down every note the

295
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,560
word from word from Spirit and I put it

296
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,639
in there I didn't want to miss anything

297
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,680
and um even when Spirit was going on

298
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,560
tangents I said okay I I'll have to fit

299
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,560
that in somewhere I'll have to that's

300
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,440
not what my question was to Spirit but

301
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,639
I'll have to fit I'll have to fit that

302
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:28,360
in somewhere in the book and and I just

303
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,760
I just did everything I could to get

304
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,720
this book to where it needs to be so you

305
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,240
become an expert an expert not just in

306
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,200
thyroid but an expert in medicine in so

307
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,240
many different ways in so many different

308
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,160
ways in chronic illness so don't miss

309
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,120

310
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,680
different things about the thyroid I

311
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,079
talk about the Undiscovered hormones of

312
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,720
the thyroid talk about what the thyroid

313
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:55,200
really does what it really does for the

314
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,720
body like what its job really is

315
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,880
throughout the entire body and how even

316
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,680
if you had it surgically removed there's

317
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,600
tissue left over even the best surgeon

318
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,600
can't get all the tissue out of a

319
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,240
thyroid and the tissue still

320
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,680
communicates within the body nobody

321
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,199
knows this but Spirit nobody knows this

322
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,800
but Spirit you know I got some people

323
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,600
that you know they just don't they just

324
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,279
don't like hearing what I do because you

325
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,800
know it's not it's not um it's not the

326
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
way they would like it so like well okay

329
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:31,760
no I know where I got the information

330
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,199
from my source and then you got some

331
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,600
people that say this had to come from

332
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:39,800
his Source because it's impossible for

333
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,959
this to come anywhere else you couldn't

334
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,880
get this in this just there's no way

335
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:49,839
anyone could even you know create this

336
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,839
information on chronic illness it has to

337
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,120
come from a source I've had people say

338
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,720
that to me that's said it has to come

339
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,959
from a source there's no way this

340
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,040
information can come from anywhere else

341
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,920
but the source you talk to I mean it's

342
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,000
there it's there you cannot miss

343
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,440

344
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,839

347
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,279

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,959
believe that nobody talks about you're

349
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,040

social media when I go on Facebook and I

363
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,240
look at Facebook and everything else and

364
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,279
I saw it social media and I saw some

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,519
people say he didn't let us down he

366
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,040

Bible he didn't let us down it's

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,480
unbelievable you wouldn't believe what

369
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,079
this is

370
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,079
and and so I don't think I let you down

371
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,120
again with thyroid healing meaning I

372
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,720
don't think I let you down as

373
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,440
well if that sounds right okay so let's

374
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,480
go into Bell's paly here we are here we

375
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,480
are the droop the droop in the eye the

376
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,240
droop in the face the droop on one lip

377
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,800
droop in the mouth a droop on one side

378
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,959
of the nose the muscles that can't be

379
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,160
use so you can't like raise raise your

380
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,199
face up if you want anymore some people

381
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
have a droop in one eye droop just in in

382
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,519
one part of the mouth some people have a

383
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,000
droop in an eye on one side of their

384
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,560
face a

385
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,839
droop in their around their mouth at

386
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,399
their mouth at the other side of the

387
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,160
face I mean it can go it can go in all

388
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,759
kinds of different

389
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,000
ways you can get a droop on the side of

390
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,920
the head but not quite really feel it

391
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,360
cuz it's not hitting the face so much

392
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,639
but yet it's it's there it's kind of

393
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,680
putting a little bit of a

394
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:11,680
tug but bills paly and general can even

395
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,440
you know affect more than that see they

396
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,800
tend to if if if Bell's ply

397
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,279
occurs and it does more than the face

398
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,880
then you know a doctor be like well I

399
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,720
don't know if it's B poliy maybe it

400
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,839
looks like now multiple sclerosis maybe

401
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,240
it looks like something else in the

402
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,040
guessing game

403
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,639
happens and then it's like you know

404
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,160
where do we go I mean what is it isab

405
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,160
Belle's py we're going by a set of

406
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,519
symptoms person feels it in their arm

407
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,680
they feel it in their shoulder and the

408
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,319
side of their face is this multiple

409
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,120
scris what is this whole thing still

410
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:42,279
could be Bells

411
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,519
paly yeah sure you could put a name on

412
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,279
it you can put multiple Ms on things

413
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,000
whatever you want but what causes that

414
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,160
mess well it's viral what causes Bell

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,959
paly it's

416
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:55,120
viral it's

417
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,240
viral say with bell paly with B paly

418
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,720
it's the shingles virus I brought this

419
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,160
to the table through spirit I was the

420
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,079
first I I I'm going to I'm bold enough

421
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,360
to say that cuz I can say it I can say

422
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,199
it because it's it's it's a fact I

423
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,800
brought the shingles virus and the bell

424
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,120
Paul Bells paly connection to light

425
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,319
years and years and years

426
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,279
ago to such a

427
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:20,480
degree that it actually worked its way

428
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,680
around a little

429
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,240
bit it's worked its way around and then

430
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,839
of course it's in medical medium book

431
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,360
one which really got it to just take off

432
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,839
like lightning

433
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,920
all through the medical communities both

434
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,959
conventional and alternative where

435
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,920
shingles can be Bell's paly the very

436
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:44,800
mystery thing the very mystery

437
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,199
thing now but what shingles where what

438
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,079
how well I was the first to bring up the

439
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,600
fact there's over 31 varieties of

440
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,639
shingles unknown to medical research and

441
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,199
medical science medical research and

442
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,480
medical scientists think there's one

443
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,440
type of shingles herpes

444
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,759
zer that's just one type of

445
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,799
shingles you know you get the rash the

446
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:08,600
rash has to be textbook there you go bam

447
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,760
there you are that's

448
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
shingles but that's changing a little

449
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,400
thanks to the medical medium book one in

450
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,640
spirit that's changing now it's amazing

451
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
and and that's starting to change a

452
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,360
little bit and that's helped from you

we're contributing

458
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,919
contributing into medicine that's what

459
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,440
we're

460
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,799
doing and the deal is with Belle's

461
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,080
ballsy is it is a shingles variety but

462
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,400
it's it's one of the varieties you can

463
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,000
have two different shingles varieties in

464
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,559
the body one that gives you that that

465
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,640
plain old shingles like bam you got

466
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,480
shingles you got the rash it's brutal

467
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,360
you got it on on your butt top of your

468
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,919
butt your hip you got it on your back

469
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,840
you got it across your

470
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:03,080
stomach ug ug ug ug it

471
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,600
hurts but that's a different variety

472
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,280
than the one that causes Bel that causes

473
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,760
Bell paly you can never show you can you

474
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:14,760
cannot even have a rash

475
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,559
ever ever not one push will pop out of

476
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,520
the skin and

477
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:24,840
hurt okay and still get Bell's paly from

478
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,600
shingles and still get Bell's paly from

479
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,440
shingles because Bell's paly from

480
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,360
shingles is one of the 31 varieties it's

481
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,559
a specific variety that causes Bells

482
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,440
paly which still won't be identified by

483
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,880
research and science for another 30 40

484
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,480
years if even

485
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,799
mhm and

486
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,400
um just took a sip of some herbal tea so

487
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,679
looks like I think it's chamomile and uh

488
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,080
today so

489
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:58,520
anyway the bottom line is is it's just

490
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,000
this one specific variety that t tends

491
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,039
to go after the trigeminal nerve but man

492
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,960
you don't have to have Bell's paly from

493
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:08,240
this variety this variety is really

494
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,240
annoying because it can hurt the gums it

495
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,120
can hurt the teeth it can burn the mouth

496
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,200
a little

497
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,280
bit it can cause pain in the

498
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
ear which I really hate I hate when

499
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,760
someone comes to me meaning I love when

500
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,159
people I love all people but I hate when

501
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,760
they have to go through that I hate when

502
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,880
someone has to come to me and they're

503
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,480
like you know I got this pain that's so

504
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,120
bad it's completely I can't get a

505
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
diagnosis from it it's this mystery pain

506
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,840
in my ear and in my jaw that's killing

507
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,039
me I got to go on opioids I got to go on

508
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,280
drugs I got to go on medications I got

509
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:46,039
to go t on tons of medications to try to

510
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,760
numb this thing up I can't function I

511
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,000
feel so bad for people that go through

512
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,400
that that's a variety of shingles that's

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,559
the one that causes Bell's py but it

514
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,240
doesn't have to cause Bell's pausy too

515
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,480
it can miss the nerve to the face it

516
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,360
could miss certain nerves to the face it

517
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,360
can just instead slam the trigal nerve

518
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,080
down lower it can hit different parts of

519
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,039
nerves it's not a perfect virus where

520
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,080
it's going to hit its Mark every

521
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,760
time that's not how it's going to go

522
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,799
that's not how it's going to go and it

523
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,840
can go on one side or the other it's

524
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,640
really annoying and you can have another

525
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,480
shingles virus to boot that can give you

526
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,400
shingles on the back of your neck puls

527
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,000
it can give you shingles on your face

528
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,799
and it still not be that variety

529
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,240
and that variety can still cause nerve

530
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,080
pain on the face and head and all this

531
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,039
other stuff and all kinds of problems

532
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,520
sure but the Bells Palsy one you know it

533
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,039
it can hit the trigeminal liver can hurt

534
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,240
the teeth back of the jaw hit up there

535
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,840
in the ear ouch ouch ouch and go to the

536
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
dentist he's drilling all your teeth

537
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,880
he's pulling teeth he doesn't know

538
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
what's happening now they're getting a

539
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,960
little bit more wiser the information I

540
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,480
put out there is getting out there and

541
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,120
dentists are being very cautious they're

542
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,440
like I'm not going to touch those teeth

543
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm not going to touch those teeth they

544
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,840
don't look bad I'm not going to go near

545
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,960
them I drilled out a bunch of teeth 10

546
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,480
years ago during a few patients who had

547
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,919
this I learned from the past I'm hearing

548
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,039
different information through other

549
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
patients I'm not going to mess with

550
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,559
those teeth we got something going on

551
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
that's causing nerve pain and that's

552
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,640
what's happening now so dentists are

553
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,440
getting wise it's it's an amazing time

554
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,720
it's an amazing

555
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,760
time it

556
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,520
is but

557
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,240
when that Bell's paly happens though and

558
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,840
it hits the nerve just

559
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,200
right yeah just right and the eye troops

560
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,360
are the face troops

561
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,360
and it's really

562
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,120
annoying sets people back sometimes it

563
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,760
hurts sometimes it doesn't hurt at all

564
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,960
sometimes it's just straight numb

565
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,080
sometimes they don't feel anything it's

566
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,400
just a droop depends there's so many

567
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,159
nerves there's thousands of nerves in

568
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,360
they little tiny once and if the virus

569
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,559
kind of worked its way into a batch of

570
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,840
nerves versus another batch of nerves

571
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,720
and that's what it could do it can alter

572
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,279
the symptom it could change the

573
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,480
symptom and that's what it could

574
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,679
do so this Bell's paly that's the

575
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,840
shingles

576
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,880
variety and even the shingles variety

577
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,640
these nerves they also run to the brain

578
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,559
a little bit they connect to the Vegas

579
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
they connect to the frenic nerves they

580
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,120
find their ways until all these nerves

581
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,919
kind of come together into the brain

582
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,480
there's little little places where these

583
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,400
nerves join together connect or get

584
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,159
close to if one nerve gets inflamed and

585
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
it's near another nerve it can affect

586
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,960
that other nerve to some degree even if

587
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,320
they're not even directly

588
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,039
connected so you can get you can get a

589
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,320
host of different symptoms when it comes

590
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,520
down to Bell's paly Bell's paly usually

591
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,120
hits people when they're in their late

592
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:52,360
30s early 40s how come how come how come

593
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,600
then because like most viruses they tend

594
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,159
to hit a little later it's like the

595
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,679
original Epstein bar virus like the

596
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,520
original Epstein bar virus in the 19 50s

597
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,400
when all the women were upset because

598
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,440
they had hot flashes for the first time

599
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,279
in history they had night sweats for the

600
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,919
first time in his history they had um

601
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,559
fatigue for the first time in history

602
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,559
that was different than just staying up

603
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,880
late or something or taking a cruise or

604
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,000
a trip or working hard at the office or

605
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,039
working hard on their job in the factory

606
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,480
they had fatigue for the first

607
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:28,600
time it was all in the late 1940s early

608
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,480
1950s this is when the medical world was

609
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,080
developing hormones and decided to

610
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,760
overlook what was really the cause of

611
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,360
this was this the first outbreaks of

612
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,640
real Epstein bar the first big outbreaks

613
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,320
the the whole swing of outbreaks and it

614
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,640
hit women all in their 40s so what what

615
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,600
did they do they put two and two

616
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,360
together one and one together said uh

617
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,159
this is okay a lady and she's um she's

618
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,080
45 years old she was born in 1900 she's

619
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
45 years old now and now she has these

620
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,840
symptoms it has to be the change it has

621
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,320
to be per menopause it has to be

622
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
menopause one of the greatest mistakes

623
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,799
in history that's still made now and it

624
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,320
was Epstein bar so women right now

625
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,000
because women didn't go through the

626
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,799
change in the old days the only thing

627
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,960
that stopped was their their period it

628
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,600
stopped and they got more energy they

629
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,279
felt better they had more libido they

630
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
had all these things that came to them

631
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,200
after this that was known but all that

632
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,520
changed when Epstein bar came into town

633
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,919
when the change the change came epine

634
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,960
bar snuck up on everybody created all

635
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,640
the symptoms weight gain fatigue all

636
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,279
these different problems well when that

637
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,279
happened in

638
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,600
1950 when that happened it's like well

639
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:39,360
why is it at this time is at this time

640
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,200
because most of these viruses they have

641
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,080
a timeline to them I see it happen all

642
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,320
the time with men in their late 30s men

643
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,399
get whacked and all of a sudden they

644
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,000
think they have Lyme disease they're

645
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,640
getting diagnosed with Lyme Disease by

646
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,440
by 10 Lyme doctors that have no idea

647
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,000
what's wrong with them and it they're 39

648
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,320
years old men that are 39 years old and

649
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,760
they got neurological problems they're

650
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,080
getting diagnosed with Lyme disease

651
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,559
carelessly

652
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,320
and the same thing with women all the

653
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,399
time now it's either late 30s now cuz

654
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,080
the world's the world is different M the

655
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:08,480
viruses have mutated stress is up the

656
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,200
world is a whole different place to live

657
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,000
in now and women have a lot more

658
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,240
pressure on them so they get they get

659
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,600
whacked around 39 now

660
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,760
42 sometimes 30 now there's different

661
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,360
varieties that all of a sudden they're

662
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,360
being 30 years old and they got all the

663
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,520
symptoms Epstein bar or they have their

664
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,640
first baby EP Ste bar afterwards all

665
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,039
this different

666
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,679
stuff the viruses have these times lines

667
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:31,640
and this certain variety of shingles

668
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,960
tends to wait a little bit later before

669
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,440
it comes out and it comes out later on

670
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,440
you don't see too many um you don't see

671
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,440
young women with to you know with B paly

672
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,720
too often it does happen but it's very

673
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,279
rare I me it's not as rare as it used to

674
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,520
be it used to be extremely rare before

675
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:50,880
20 years ago it was almost

676
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,600
impossible that to see that out there

677
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:58,559
now it's a little bit more out there but

678
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:02,120
but mostly it's women you know 45 48 50

679
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,919
39 it starts it could happen um and they

680
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,480
get their first bat of Bell's py 42 43

681
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,559
years old and that's when it

682
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,799
happens that's the timeline and that's

683
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,480
what these viruses do just like the

684
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,080
epine bars there's so many varieties of

685
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,360
Epstein bars

686
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,520
now that you know they can affect women

687
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,399
when they're just coming out of college

688
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,919
where they're fatigued aches and pains

689
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,480
they get you know diagnosed with

690
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,240
rheumatoid arthritis and then they get

691
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,720
diagnosed with uh with the chronic

692
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,799
fatigue syndrome then they get diagnosed

693
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,320
with Lyme disease then they get

694
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,200
diagnosed with whatever and they're just

695
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,840
fatigued and they can't they can't work

696
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,840
they come back home from college it hits

697
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,120
them really young you get those

698
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,000
varieties of Epstein bar and then you

699
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,600
get the varieties of Epstein bar that

700
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
people have with people who are 60 years

701
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,880
old now and they get their first wave of

702
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,840
epine bar at age 60 where everything was

703
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,919
smooth sailing all the way to age 60 and

704
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,360
now they're getting the fatigue the

705
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,919
aches and pains and now they get all

706
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
these symptoms and some tingles and

707
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,080
numbness and they get the ringing in the

708
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,279
ears that's the epscene bar there's

709
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,440
different varieties different varieties

710
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
that actually come later different

711
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,600
varieties that come earlier I'll tell

712
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,520
you in thyroid healing I talk about

713
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,080
Epstein bar some information I've never

714
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,559
talked about anywhere like it it it it

715
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,080
it is unbelievable What Spirit gave

716
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,000
me so so when it comes down in Bell's

717
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,520
paly that's just one variety of shingles

718
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,440
that one variety of shingles could

719
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,159
mutate and get a little different and

720
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,520
change and all through the years go on

721
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:23,880
and it could hit people a little younger

722
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,720
but for the most part it hits people a

723
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,640
little bit later that's at one variety

724
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,000
of Bell's paly

725
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
I mean you know that one variety of

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,080
shingles which causes Bells paly sorry

727
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,760
about that

728
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,440
um so what do you do for

729
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,600
it

730
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,880
antivirals you could do antivirals

731
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,880
before that I mean say you're in your

732
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,679
30s and you haven't gotten Bells posy or

733
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,200
anything and you're under tons of stress

734
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,320
let's do some good foods let's do some

735
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,760
antivirals so we don't get it so we

736
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,600
don't get hit with it how about that how

737
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,240
about them apples right we can do that

738
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,080
that but if we have had it we want to

739
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,159
nip it so it doesn't come again cuz it

740
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,760
could come

741
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,399
again it of course it can and it could

742
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,600
do uh it could come again it could do

743
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:10,640
other things it could hurt the jaw it

744
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,919
could hurt

745
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,519
anything so we want to protect ourselves

746
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,679
antiviral let's talk about Foods never

747
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,679
to

748
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,960
eat someone said to me how come you're

749
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,480
so against

750
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,760
eggs what how come you're so against

751
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,720
eggs and I know that many of you know

752
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,360
the story where when I was a kid when I

753
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,320
was a kid I can make eggs like nobody

754
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,640

755
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,240
eggs I mean I could scramble them I

756
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,360
could fry them Sunny Side Up I could

757
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:45,120
poach them I could throw cheese in

761
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,159
was really good they were never burnt

762
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,120
unless someone requested a burnt egg

763
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:00,519

764
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,120

00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,360
vegetable in there right well yeah of

769
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,840

it because it bothered spirit I love the

775
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,360
fact that it irritated the heck out of

776
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
spirit because spirits spirit's most

777
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:33,679
disliked food is

778
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,159

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,760
would you believe it eggs spirit is

780
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,519
nothing against eggs chicken eggs

781
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,519
nothing against eggs what it was was

782
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:46,960
what happened to eggs eggs became a food

783
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,600
along the way cuz research and science

784
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,880
used eggs to actually grow bugs it's a

785
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,000
grave mistake because they ruined our

786
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:59,200
eggs they ruined them ruined our

787
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,720
eggs they took eggs and they used it all

788
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,679
in the labs all in the

789
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:10,279
1920s all in the 1930s all the 1940s

790
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,559
1950s all in the 1960s all in the

791
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:14,480
1970s propagated tons and tons of

792
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,360
different kinds of bugs viruses played

793
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,360
around with viruses played around with

794
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:25,519
bacteria they put egg and

795
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,559
antibiotics eggs and

796
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:31,600
antibiotics they messed with eggs

797
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,600
they've ruined them it became a food for

798
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,559
bugs it became a food for Epstein bar it

799
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
became a food for shingles it became a

800
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,640
food for

801
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,360
viruses and it's not the perfect food we

802
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,320
wanted it to be or wanted to be but

803
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,080

827
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,720
rules the truth

828
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,279
rules truth rules that's pretty cool you

829
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,320
know real truth rules and what it is is

830
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,519
eggs feed bugs of every single kind

831
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,159
every single way so if you're a meat

832
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,880
eater keep the eggs

833
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,159
out keep the eggs out if you're a vegan

834
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,320
well you're not going to eat eggs duh if

835
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,399
you're vegetarian you're going to eat

836
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,240
eggs though that's another thing

837
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,080
vegetarians eat eggs that's one of the

838
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,440
not every vegetarian you'll find a

839
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,080
vegetarian like no I don't eat eggs I

840
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,559
don't eat this but you'll find a

841
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,840
vegetarian they be like no I eat eggs

842
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,000
every day where am I where else am I

843
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,440
going to get my protein you know a

844
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,919
confusion on

845
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,559
protein because protein you know protein

846
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,000
is not what fuels people it's calories

847
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,639
that fuel people that's how you can get

848
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,200
up in the morning function that's how

849
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,080
you can get through your day that's how

850
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,919
you can work that's how you can think

851
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,720
it's

852
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,279
calories it's not protein that does that

853
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,880
protein doesn't do that that's not what

854
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:28,080
protein

855
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,080
does you take protein and separated and

856
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,600
just feed that to a person they will

857
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,600
starve to death in no time become

858
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:38,399
emaciated and

859
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:41,000
die cuz there's no calories in protein

860
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,240
if you you can give somebody cartons and

861
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,120
cartons and cartons of protein carton's

862
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,000
a protein and if you separate the

863
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,440
calorie from it which is the sugar the

864
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,960
carbohydrate or even the fat and you

865
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,799
separate that and you just give them

866
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,720
protein they will die I mean fast it's

867
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:02,039
horrific it's

868
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,080
horrible it was actually done before in

869
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,320
an experiment back in the

870
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,399
1950s it's just terrifying

871
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,039
terrifying bunch of people signed on to

872
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:17,799
it and stupidly did

873
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,039
it you know so the point is the point

874
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,480
back to where I was saying the egg I'm

875
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,240
ripping it apart today I can't help it

876
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,039
and sadly I'd want to but I can't help

877
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,720
it the deal is is it feeds bugs it l

878
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,480
loves feeding the shingles well shingles

879
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,039
loves the egg is what I'm saying it's

880
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,639
one of its big Foods it's one of its

881
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:38,799
favorite foods you get Belle's paly quit

882
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:40,880
the eggs you stop them whatever you do

883
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,200
because it's a virus feeding food and

884
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,840
it's not the egg's fault it's not the

885
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,760
chicken's fault it's not your fault it's

886
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,360
not my fault it's it's actually the

887
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,480
people in the labs that was a food they

888
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,519
they actually gave bugs to keep them

889
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,960
alive even though they tell us bugs

890
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,840
don't eat anything it's amazing

891
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,519
amazing I mean there's some smarty pants

892
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,760
people out there in the industry that

893
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
have have you know thrown on social

894
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,440
media or something else and they say

895
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,720
they say look he doesn't realize that

896
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,000
viruses can't eat anything they can't

897
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,720
feed on anything oh look how dumb he is

898
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,960
the medical

899
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,760
medium unbelievable

900
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,240
unbelievable of course viruses feed on

901
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,679
something it has to it's just a science

902
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,960
and research a doesn't know how a virus

903
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,879
e and B it does know it eats something

904
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,839
because they raised bugs on food to keep

905
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,839
them alive in Labs All Through The

906
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,399
Years okay that's just the bottom line

907
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,520
I'm telling you so you want to stay away

908
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,599
from

909
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,000
eggs well that's the

910
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,320
deal stay away from dairy products that

911
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,480
doesn't help with shingles there's no

912
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,000
question about it stay away from pork it

913
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
doesn't help the shingles it's so high

914
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,880
in fat that it's not good and believe me

915
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
those high fat diets out there aren't a

916
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,280
great thing they're not a great thing

917
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,599
even though they made them healthier by

918
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,440
saying well let's do a little bit more

919
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,040
avocado let's not just have it all

920
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,480
animal fat let's do a little bit more

921
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,200
avocado let's do a little bit more

922
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,520
coconut oil and how come they're doing

923
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,079
that they're doing that because they're

924
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,680
learning from mistakes because when you

925
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,280
go all animal fat that's not good

926
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,680
either that was tried and done heart

927
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,359
attack city man heart attack city so

928
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,200
they going to coconut oil and other and

929
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:27,320
some you know other fats and some high

930
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,880
quality oil and going with avocado fat

931
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,960
so that's coming into the play I mean

932
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,680
it's like it's it's it's ridiculous it's

933
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,280
like it's like come on of course coconut

934
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
oil is okay for we could have some of it

935
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,160
of course avocados are good but you got

936
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,079
to keep your fats low especially if

937
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,920

you don't want to eat cotton candy at

942
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,839
the

943
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,040
fair but you but you want to have fruit

944
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,359
which is really good for Bell's

945
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,400
paly you want to have sweet potato

946
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,119
really good for Bell's paly incredible

947
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,119
actually regular potatoes are even

948

better for excuse me for Belle's

949
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,520
paly talking so fast here excuse

00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,520
me so regular potatoes are really good

951
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:22,359
for Bell's paly amazing for Bell's paly

952
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,480
because they're so loaded with a a

953
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,040
bioactive lysine one that's so strong

954
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,440
and so powerful that a weapon it's a

955
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,160
weapon against Bells paly lene take a

956
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,520
lot of lene too take capsules of line

957
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
Plus have a few

958
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,079
potatoes you know that's the kind of

959
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,920
thing you do you don't have eggs and

960
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:42,359
potatoes because the eggs will feed the

961
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,040
virus while you're trying to kill off

962
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,960
the virus and yes you want to kill off

963
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,520
the virus you want to get the right zinc

964
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,319
if you have any concerns you go to about

965
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,599
what supplements are best what lysine's

966
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,400
the best you go to my supplement

967
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,160
directory on medicalmedium.com and

968
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,560
that's not a ploy to sell you vitamins

969
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,440
cuz I don't sell sell vitamins I don't

970
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,160

vitamins I don't I don't suck you into a

972
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,440
radio show to try to sell you a vitamin

973
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,280
it's a directory to take you to a place

974
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,480
that actually tells you hey this not

975
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,920
tells you but it's it's we telling you

976
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,480
this is what I would use if I had Bell's

977
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,359
paly this is what I would use it's this

978
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,680
lysine it's you know it's this vitamin C

979
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:24,000
it's this so um medical medium.com and

980
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,280
look for that and if you're comfortable

981
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,720
with what you got already and you're

982
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,720
comfortable with something you have like

983
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,359
who might have changeed that just then

984
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,560
if you think it works or feel good it

985
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:37,000
feels like it's working use it um but

986
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,359
yeah yeah you want to have foods that

987
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,720
actually are weapons against viruses so

988
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,440
you don't get the Bell paly back or you

989
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,480
can shorten its duration licorice Root's

supplement so monol laurin's really good

1009
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,280
I like golden seal for helping to knock

1010
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,319
down Belle's py too the shingles virus I

1011
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,079
like golden seal little little stin of

1012
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:37,520
golden seal go on it for two weeks then

1013
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,000
take a break for two weeks go on it

1014
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,599
again for two weeks take a break for two

1015
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
weeks talk to your practitioner on some

1016
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,200
dosages maybe your practitioner is

1017
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,520
really liberal with dosages and can fill

1018
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,160
you out and know what you need and what

1019
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,599
you don't need and that's really helpful

1020
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,520
too and that's what's amazing that's

1021
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,800
what's amazing out

1022
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,640
there so these are some of the things

1023
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,000
you can use I like B12 because B12 the

1024
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,520
right kind of B12 the B12 that I've been

1025
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,599
fortunate enough to introduce to

1026
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,640
everybody to get the to get that going

1027
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,640
finally a trend that's that's in the

1028
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,640
favor of someone so a trend where Dino

1029
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,000
Sil kabalan and methyl kabalan both

1030
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,839
joined is the actually way to use is

1031
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
what you really need to use for B12 for

1032
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:19,920
neurological problems Spirit taught me

1033
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,440
that many many years ago and I had to

1034
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,040
wait for that to be developed by

1035
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,240
Geniuses out there in the

1036
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,000
world and so you know so many good

1037
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,680
things an alternative medicine I know I

1038
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,440
rip apart the bad things but there's so

1039
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,720
many good things it's not even funny

1040
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,160
it's incredible so the B12 you use the

1041
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,440
right kind of B12 every day that's

1042
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,920
important right there because it helps

1043
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,640
restore the nerves because the nerves

1044
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,160
get so they're so stressed out it's

1045
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,440
unbelievable because they're so stressed

1046
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,599
out from the shingles

1047
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,880
virus so that's another great thing to

1048
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,240
use I like Spina because it gets rid of

1049
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,839
heavy metals that the shingles virus

1050
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,319
likes to feed off of so I like the heavy

1051
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,760
metal detox smoothie always always offer

1052
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,119
you know because it helps get the metals

1053
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,400
out and it's a gentle one it's so gentle

1054
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:09,000
but effective God that's what we

1055
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,920
want so that's really helpful too hup is

1056
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,920
a good herb hup that's a good antiviral

1057
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,839
time time tea time water that's good

1058
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,200
oregano capsules that's good for uh

1059
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:21,839
Belle's

1060
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:25,079
paly oregano capsules it's another one

1061
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,680
there so we got we got different options

1062
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,640
we can use as antiviral

1063
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,720
to um really help with Bell's

1064
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,560
paly and sometimes it doesn't even take

1065
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,560
too much catclaw is a great one too for

1066
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,440
Bell's paly I love cats claw for

1067
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,359
shingles first of all shingles the

1068
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,599
shingles virus is responsible for Lyme

1069
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,640
disease all the herpetic viruses are

1070
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,000
responsible for limes disease Lyme

1071
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,280
disease I talk about that in book one

1072
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,839
you could read the

1073
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,160
chapter and um that's the real respon

1074
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:57,839
that's the real responsible group for

1075
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,839
lime that's why cats claw actually helps

1076
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,599
lime

1077
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,240
patients that's why it helps lime

1078
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,079
patients something I've been

1079
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,880
recommending cats claw going back 30

1080
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,920
plus years for people with lime and then

1081
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,160
some that didn't have to to live in the

1082
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,560
lime trap of misinformation forever and

1083
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,720
they've been freed long long ago I feel

1084
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,040
so bad for people that don't know about

1085
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,040
the real lime information the truth and

1086
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,640
they just don't know because the the the

1087
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,359
airwaves are saturated with

1088
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,839
misinformation on

1089
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,560
lime and yeah sure but you know people

1090
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,960
get mad they get the pitchforks out and

1091
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,200
they get their torches and they throw

1092
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,640
stones because they're mad because

1093
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,520
because they you know they there's so

1094
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,680
much information on Lime that's so

1095
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,040
that's so crazy that they don't know who

1096
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,040
to believe what to believe but I I wrote

1097
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,839
a chapter in medical medium book one and

1098
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,000
it's the viruses that cause the symptoms

1099
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:48,920
the lime is neurological because viruses

1100
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,440
cause the neurological problems I don't

1101
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,760
care who what what lab what is saying

1102
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,599
what that's what causes the neurological

1103
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,839
problems in Lime cat's claw works

1104
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,960
because cats is in is is

1105
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:05,119
antiviral I love it for Belle's

1106
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:08,040
paly so that's a great one

1107
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,079
there so I mean there's a lot of things

1108
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,240
you can do foodwise you got a lot of

1109
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,160
secret weapons in food it's unbelievable

1110
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,240
what you can do with

1111
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,319
food any fruit any fruit's a weapon

1112
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,119
against a virus I'm going to tell you

1113
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,599
that right now phytochemicals and fruit

1114
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,640
are antiviral many different fruits are

1115
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,480
antiviral Al something to think about

1116
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,319
leafy greens very good any kind of leafy

1117
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,760
green is antiviral to some extent fruit

1118
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:39,040
is probably more so antiviral but leafy

1119
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,040
greens are to some extent there's

1120
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,200
there's a lot of great stuff in

1121
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,280
food I mean look if you're an animal

1122
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,400
protein lover you just need to know fine

1123
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,680
it won't

1124
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,480
feed it won't feed a shingles virus

1125
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,960
causing Bell's paly but if you eat too

1126
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,440
much animal protein while you have

1127
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,200
Bell's paly you get too much anim animal

1128
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,760
fat which thickens up the blood and it

1129
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,000
doesn't allow oxygen to get to the

1130
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,280
nerves to help and it doesn't allow your

1131
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,040
immune system to get to the nerves to

1132
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,000
help get rid of the Bel py fast if

1133
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,800
you're eating too much chicken too much

1134
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,839
lean chicken and too much lean meat and

1135
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,200
whatever there's still so much fat in it

1136
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,520
got to be cautious you got to lower your

1137
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,520
portions if you're an animal protein

1138
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,079
lover there's nothing in animal protein

1139
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,160
that's antiviral that's not me against

1140
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:22,559
animal protein I'm just telling you you

1141
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,839
can still eat it and you can keep it in

1142
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:30,240
your diets but there's nothing antiviral

1143
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:33,280
in animal protein against a virus

1144
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,359
there's just nothing there that there

1145
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,680
there's nothing there now look if you're

1146
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,200
saying oh he's bias against meat eaters

1147
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,119
no if you're a vegan or a

1148
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,480
vegetarian if you're a vegetarian

1149
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,920
there's nothing antiviral in Dairy and

1150
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,240
nothing antiviral in eggs it's even

1151
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,720
worse because eggs and dairy feed

1152
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,599
viruses a piece of grass-fed lean meat

1153
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,359
might not feed viruses so much it could

1154
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:02,240
feed a little if the fat content gets

1155
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,640
too high in the body then the viruses

1156
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,440
could they could just they could they

1157
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,240
can proliferate so that's true but but

1158
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,400
eggs and dairy are

1159
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,280
worse and then what if you're a vegan

1160
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,119
and you're eating nothing but just white

1161
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:16,559
bread all the time you're eating that

1162
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:18,520
star bought white bread and you're

1163
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,200
eating you know whatever that kind of

1164
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,520
thing all the time but you're staying

1165
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,640
vegan but you're eating tons of white

1166
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,119
bread that white

1167
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,559
bread there's nothing in there to to

1168
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,960
kill a virus there's nothing in there to

1169
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:34,280
kill a virus see I'm not picking on one

1170
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,640
diet but in fruits and vegetables and

1171
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,280
leafy greens and herbs and spices

1172
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,200
everything I list in lifechanging Foods

1173
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,559
the book life-changing foods and many of

1174
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,800
the things I list in book one and many

1175
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:49,200
of the things I list in thyroid healing

1176
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:53,040
are antiviral that's the whole

1177
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,839
point that's the whole point right

1178
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,400
there just seeing you know 40 years ago

1179
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:01,000
Spirit telling me when I was a little

1180
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,640
kid over 40 years ago Spirit telling me

1181
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,440
about antiviral and me trying to express

1182
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,280
that to somebody just see it's like they

1183
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,319
thought they they thought they thought I

1184
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,240
had four

1185
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:13,520
heads but here I am S 8 n years old and

1186
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm trying to tell

1187
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,400
somebody about

1188
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,800
antiviral and I'm trying to tell them

1189
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,319
about antiviral I'm trying to tell them

1190
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,440
about foods that will stop viruses I'm

1191
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,079
trying to tell them that their condition

1192
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,200
is viral you should see you should have

1193
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,640
seen what happened it was like their

1194
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,480
eyeballs popped out of their head they

1195
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
like went someplace they like went out

1196
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,160
of body they went out of

1197
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,319
body I mean people they don't know what

1198
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,000
I've done and what I've been through

1199
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,839
they can't even imagine it's so funny

1200
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,119
because there's a lot of different

1201
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,880
people psychics and different mediums

1202
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,520
and stuff like that you know out there

1203
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
now it's great I'm glad we need as many

1204
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,319
healers as we can but I'm going to tell

1205
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,760
you right now you should have seen you

1206
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,839
should have seen me as a child telling

1207
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,040
somebody this is the virus you have you

1208
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,200
have hhv6 this is what it's causing you

1209
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,000
have hhv6 this is what it's causing and

1210
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,800
you need an antiviral food and this is

1211
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,160
what you need it was like it was like a

1212
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,440
flying saucer came out of the sky landed

1213
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,040
right there made a burn mark right in a

1214
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,280
right right on the ground in front of

1215
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,200
them and they like went out of body cuz

1216
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,400
there was just it wasn't even

1217
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,160
computable and even

1218
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,240
seriously

1219
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,920
seriously

1220
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,559
so right all right so look the bottom

1221
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,680
line is I guess the point I'm trying to

1222
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:32,400
make as I'm telling you telling you

1223
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,000
these things the point I'm trying to

1224
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:39,040
make is that yes we want to do

1225
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,960
antivirals both in herbs both in spices

1226
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,480
and everything else and you can do

1227
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,200
garlic is anti viral I love garlic and

1228
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,760
onions for Belle's paly it's incredible

1229
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,079
what does it do it go it it it it

1230
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,839
defends you against the jingles virus it

1231
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:56,920
knocks its Army down it drops its Army

1232
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,640
down it lowers its neurotox

1233
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,920
the neurotoxin that saturates the trial

1234
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,800
nerves and the different nerves the the

1235
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,680
fascial nerves and it saturates those

1236
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,359
nerves that neurotoxin and it causes it

1237
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,960
to get defunct and it causes it so boom

1238
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:14,800
you got the droop like wow we got the

1239
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,440

1240
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,839

00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,359
undiscovered to the nerve endings to the

1263
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,760

1284
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:04,359
lucky I've been blessed I've never had a

1285
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,839
cavity in my life so I've never had a

1286
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:08,760
filling or my teeth have never been

1287
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:11,799
drilled in my life and I've never had a

1288
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,480
cavity and you know and I and honestly

I promise you that that's not genes that

1291
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Spirit when I was a young age telling me

1292
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,520
to bring in some foods at a young age to

1293
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,960
get rid of mercury and heavy metals that

1294
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:30,559
were inherently our already in me so you

1295
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,040
know so that wouldn't happen number one

1296
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,880
and also to to to to make sure you you

1297
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,040
mineralizing the teeth so I was lucky

1298
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,160
