is not found anywhere else and is

10
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,960
decades ahead of what's out there now as

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,280
I've always said who has 10 20 30 years

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,600
to wait for answers because when you're

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,520
sick and you don't feel good regardless

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,520
of whatever whatever the diagnosis is or

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,600
non-diagnosis or wrong diagnosis or

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,800
misdiagnosis whatever it is if you're

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,680

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,920
right maybe it's not right maybe it is

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,120
doesn't matter you don't feel good and

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,960

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,680
get a lot worse a lot worse we're

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,360

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,120
there we're we're getting there just

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,319
we're we're we're there's a reason why

96
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm talking about this because we're

97
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:57,120
heading into COPD hang in there this is

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,519
the only show just so you know where the

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,560
information here doesn't come from

100
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,760
medical interest group groups it's not

101
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,319
repackaged reg garbled it's not

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,760
repackaged recycled Theory constantly in

103
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:10,000
every single book out there right now in

104
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,720
the medical realm alternatively and

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,840
conventionally it's not recycled it's

106
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,560
not repackaged and just Rewritten and

107
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,000
thrown back out there with bogus studies

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,799
and everything else and citations of

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,960
bogus studies this information is free

110
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,280
from all of that thank God because

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,720
that's why I've been able to get people

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,120
better over the last 35 years and even

113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,840
more since I was four years old so it's

114
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,080
not backed by you know medical funding

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,000
with strings attached it's not it's not

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,080
attached to this information it's clean

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,039
there's no botched research interest

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,160
groups and investors investing in

119
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,280
something so the outcome comes a certain

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,520
way news flash it's like that in all

121
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,080
fields of chronic illness and medicine

122
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,600
at this point Sorry but it is and so it

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,960
doesn't have that contamination that

124
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
botch research it doesn't have the whole

125
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,919
thing with the medical lobbyist behind

126
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,199
it internal Kickbacks yeah internal

127
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,039
Kickbacks you wouldn't believe the money

128
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,120
that's constantly changing hands all

129
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:09,759
through alternative medicine alternative

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,320
medicine and conventional medicine

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,520
persuaded belief systems which poisons

132
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,639
everything persuaded belief systems is

133
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,039
like this whole thing where it becomes

134
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,840
you don't want to know the truth because

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,080
you're saturated in a belief system

136
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,680
someone doesn't want to know the truth

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
someone doesn't want to be open to the

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,800
truth cuz they're saturated in a belief

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,720
system I can't tell you what that does

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
and gets in the way and this is why

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
people are still sick and not getting

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,919
better and it's why people are getting

143
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,800
sicker and sicker and sicker private

144
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,880

184
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,319
information that's not dirtied up by all

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,199
that other garbage I just mentioned yes

186
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,039
so we're I would want it I'm sorry but I

187
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,759
would want that so we're talking about

188
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,479
COPD now what I was saying earlier is

189
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,759
that everybody's getting sick yes

190
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,960
everybody's getting sick they're getting

191
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,120
a diagnosis you go into I'm not just

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,120
talking about people that are in their

193
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,520
40s and 50s and they got some

194
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,960
hypertension and they got some heart

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,400
disease you know cooking or they had a

196
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,680
stroke which is still most Strokes are

197
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,479
actually mystery to all doctors all of

198
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,720
this would it I'm not just talking about

199
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,720
that I'm talking about people in their

200
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,160
20s I'm talking about people in their

201
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,039
30s I'm talking about people in their

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,440
teens teenagers talking about little

203
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,960
kids and little ones getting sick like

204
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,759
never before in human history just so

205
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,159
you know never before in human history

206
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm letting you know I'm letting you

207
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,599
know the truth I'm letting you know I'm

208
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,720
just I'm I'm giving it to you there I

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,400
said this in one of the other shows that

210
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,080
years ago I knew that life expectancy

211
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,240
was declining I knew that it was all it

212
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,800
was all you know it was all declining I

213
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,919
knew how long you live was declining but

214
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,199
it was ignored no one was doing any

215
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,639
studies no one was doing I knew I knew

216
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,520
of course and doesn't mean the studies

217
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,720
would even come out right because if

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,960
they want to hide that that everybody's

219
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,360
getting sicker and not healthier if they

220
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,840
want to hide that they can easily all

221
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,400
you have to do is have somebody invest

222
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,080
into the study and boom it goes the

223
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,800
direction they need to go or an investor

224
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,240
will never invest in it again and a

225
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,399
study will never happen for that person

226
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,880
who wanted to do the study career over

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,599
done so what happens is they all come in

228
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,120
you know so they've been saying oh we

229
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,080
live longer we're living longer I've

230
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,880
been watching it decline since the 80s

231
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,120
been watching it decline since the 90s

232
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,320
been watching the health decline in in

233
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,480
in the US since the 2000s and now just

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,200
recently recently it got out because it

235
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,240
was it was impossible to hide it or

236
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,519
starting to drop they're starting to say

237
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,720
well no life doesn't go as long as we

238
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,360
thought it is now it's starting to drop

239
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,800
the numbers are dropping you you don't

240
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,880
live you know life average isn't this

241
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,040
number anymore it's coming down because

242
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,399
you can't hide it you can't hide

243
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,200
it there's millions and millions of

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,240
doctors offices globally being filled up

245
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,200
and filled up and filled up and it's

246
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,360
like it's never before in history have

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
been like this and the young people the

248
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,800
young people I've said this before I've

249
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
written it in the book One medical

250
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,240
medium okay

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,200
17 roughly around this number 17 out of

252
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,000
a hundred college students go home and

253
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,000
don't come back not because they're

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,279
disinterested in their work not because

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,640
they don't want to be interested in

256
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:58,959
their studies not because they don't

257
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,240
want to be in school not because they

258
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,680
want want to change course or Direction

259
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,600
in their

260
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,880
life roughly around 17 out of a 100

261
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,640
college students go home because they're

262
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,279
done they're done they're in bed can't

263
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,480
function barely Confunction and talk

264
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,040
getting diagnoses left and right of Ms

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,000
and Lyme disease and everything else and

266
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,040
nobody knows what's going on being told

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
they're just being lazy being told that

268
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,519
they're brain foged maybe they just need

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,880
a drug going to different doctors and

270
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,160
they're done

271
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,240
that's it not going back to school and

272
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,320
most of them women most of them women

273
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,200
young women that don't end up going back

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,279
to college and then all the other

275
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,279
reindeer just moving forward they watch

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,680
all the reindeer moving forward they

277
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,839
have to sit back watching their old

278
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,320
friends move on with their careers and

279
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,560
it's not that they're not getting sick

280
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,959
either most people are in this day and

281
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
age getting things wrong with them

282
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,120
constantly non-stop no one wants to

283
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,639
check into that on how kids have to go

284
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,680
home because they're getting vertigo

285
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,480
chronic

286
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,279
vertigo and they're they're getting

287
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,320
dizzy balance problems severe severe

288
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,000
severe debilitating brain fog fatigue

289
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,200
neurological fatigue that I talk about

290
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,200
all the time and that's it gone home no

291
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,320
finishing school no one cares no one

292
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,880
cares in the industries no one cares the

293
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,680
parents care the parents care no one

294
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,120
cares no one else the parents and the

295
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,560
families of these children most of them

296
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,639
care of course and whatnot but I'm just

297
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,279
saying the industry does

298
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,360
care whatever whatever and so that's how

299
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,519
it works so is is things getting better

300
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,920
no I've been watching it it's not I used

301
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,920
to be in the I used to sit in the

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,160
nursing homes to visit clients all

303
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,639
through the years and I I see younger

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
people filing into those nursing homes

305
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,160
like never before younger younger

306
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,760
younger people younger people younger

307
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,760
people it is

308
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,000
unbelievable and that's what we live

309
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,800
with now and that's what we're living

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,360
with now but hey whatever and I say

311
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,120
whatever because you know what

312
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,200
the industry the industry just doesn't

313
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,800
care they'll just pass it off to

314
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,760
genetics pretty soon completely every

315
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,079
single disease is genetic if it's not

316
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,720
your body attacking itself which is bull

317
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,120
it's going to be the genetic theory

318
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,639
another theory this is how it's done out

319
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,959
there they're not going to go into

320
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,120
viruses really deep because you know

321
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,959
what's going to happen if they go into

322
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,000
viruses really deep if they understand

323
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,600
the 60 varieties the over 60 varieties

324
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,399
now of Epstein bar that I talk about in

325
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,240
thyroid healing and book one medical

326
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,040
medium if they start actually trying to

327
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,839
figure out any of the information that

328
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
been been providing all these years if

329
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,279
they even go into it there's going to be

330
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,959
hell to pay and I'll tell you why

331
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:42,040
because every mom out there every mother

332
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,000
and every grandmother is going to want

333
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,920
something done about it because they

334
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,240
know they would know what's going down

335
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,040
because these viruses are out here and

336
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,320
being ignored and there's going to be

337
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,880
hell to pay Mama Bear Mama Bear with her

338
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,360
children knowing that her children have

339
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,000
been affected by a virus like Epstein

340
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
bar and no one cares and they're not

341
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,160
doing anything about it and they want to

342
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,639
pass it off as all this other junk

343
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,720
medicine and junk studies and everything

344
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,160
else you wouldn't believe the hell to

345
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,199
pay if the information really got out

346
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,120
there and really got out there somebody

347
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,560
would have to be held accountable and

348
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,440
that's this is the prime example so

349
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,720
anyway we're talking about we're talking

350
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,600
about COPD and and you're probably

351
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,560
wondering well he's not getting the COPD

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,760
yet I'm talking about this because copt

353
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,040
COPD has doubled since the 8

354
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
as far as

355
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,279
cases now they say out there it's

356
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,800
doubled since the

357
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,440
80s it's more than doubled okay so my

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,920
source says it's way more than doubled

359
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:49,600
it's not doubled it's tripled since the

360
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:51,800
80s tripled since the 80s COPD so

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,759
because there's a lot of levels of COPD

362
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,279
that are not diagnosed properly of CD

363
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,720
and it's also the they don't when they

364
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,759
when they look into those things they're

365
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,720
just averaged out they're not even done

366
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,199
right but there's so many cases of

367
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,880
beginner

368
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,279
COPD and they're not even added into it

369
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,399
and also you know they also do this

370
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,279
weird thing where they just don't throw

371
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,680
every COPD case into the

372
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,399
numbers they throw the smokers in and

373
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,880
they leave others out that's what they

374
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,160
do so they say well it's doubled since

375
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,959
the80s actually you know it's tripled

376
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,639
and even going past that so how is that

377
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,240
possible how's that possible I thought

378
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,480
we're getting better in medicine I

379
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,240
thought we're getting better I mean we

380
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,000
are we got laser surgery we got

381
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,279
different you great techniques we got

382
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,240
Great Brain surgeons even though hey

383
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,480
we're still we're still like you know

384
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
like a grain of rice compared to a silo

385
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,120
of rice is in knowledge and brain

386
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,199
knowledge but we still got some great

387
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,759
brain surgeons we can transplant a few

388
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,839
different organs I mean you

389
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,560
know we got a lot going on

390
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,120
on and we got a lot of good going on but

391
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,680
why are we here with everything getting

392
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,880
worse to the degree it's getting worse

393
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,800
what's my predictions what's my

394
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,720
predictions which always come out true

395
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
what are they it's going to get a lot

396
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,360
worse than this it's going to get a lot

397
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,959
and a lot worse because when you look at

398
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,519
where the experts are going including

399
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,160
the Alternative Health experts with

400
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,720
their books and everything else and you

401
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,600
look at what they're doing and what

402
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,880
they're putting out there and what

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
they're writing we're not we're we're

404
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
not getting anything done we're not

405
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,720
going anywhere we're not going anywhere

406
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,880
and then you look you look at you know

407
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,399
the information that's out there in the

408
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,199
internet and like okay we're not going

409
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,079
anywhere there you you look at I mean

410
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,560
it's not in conventional medicine we're

411
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:49,279
not going anywhere there we're not

412
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,519
cleaning up the mess we're not cleaning

413
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,480
up the viral mess that's taken over the

414
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,600
world and the country here this country

415
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,360
here we're not looking we're not

416
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,079
figuring out what the real cause of

417
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,199
Lupus is we don't no one cares no one

418
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:07,120
cares what the real cause of Lupus is we

419
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,480
do no one else does in the industries

420
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,319
meaning nobody doctors care but nobody a

421
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,680
lot of doctors care but nobody above

422
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,839
that the people that pull the strings

423
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,399
and pull the pull the strings and make

424
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,360
the moves up there so you have to

425
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,519
understand you have to understand that

426
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,079
this is this is a serious thing going on

427
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:28,880
where I predict sickness to come even

428
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,000
more and more and more and when I see

429
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,000
the genetic stuff coming out where it's

430
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,959
all oh it's your genes let's do you know

431
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,199
let's theorize about it's your genes

432
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
that's why you're sick that means we're

433
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,000
getting nowhere because nothing's going

434
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,319
to be fixed nothing nothing's going to

435
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,040
be fixed sure you know we could do the

436
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,360
high fat trendy diets take away

437
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,639
processed food and people can get better

438
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,399
with some of their symptoms and call it

439
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,079
an autoimmune diet when they don't even

440
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,399
know what autoimmune is that's what I

441
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,519
love here's here's here's something

442
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,279
that's really really disturbing and I

443
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,639
love to talk about it because I I try to

444
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,799
I try to get people to know and

445
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,439
learn and you got the whole autoimmune

446
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,679
thing going on out there so you get all

447
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,839
this information you get all these books

448
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,839
autoimmune this autoimmune that and they

449
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,919
don't know how autoimmune works or what

450
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,640
causes it or what causes any autoimmune

451
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:19,240
diseases that's what I'm saying so do

452
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,720
you think we're going to get healthier

453
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,039
no get outside of pulling out processed

454
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,240
food and cleaning up your diet and

455
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,720
people improving their lives a little

456
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,200
bit doing more exercise and you know

457
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,080
those kinds of things can help but we're

458
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,960
still getting sicker faster younger ages

459
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,799
rampant Pace going forward like never

460
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,120
before in that and what you're seeing in

461
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,960
the literature out there now and

462
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,600
everything is not even close and here we

463
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,280
are in this year it another decade going

464
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,760
to go by another decade's going to go by

465
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,240
and no one still knows what even

466
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,120
autoimmune means except for spirit and

467
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,520
ie it's

468
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,720
disturbing it's disturbing so what's my

469
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,440
prediction lots and lots of sickness

470
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,039
like never before with bogus theories

471
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
such as the autoimmune Theory which is

472
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,039
completely wrong such as the genetic

473
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,760
theor which is completely wrong I'm not

474
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,760
not denying we don't have genes and how

475
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,480
important they are and the Mysteries

476
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,760
involved in it but it it has nothing to

477
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,480
do with the chronic illness that we're

478
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,600
seeing with people suffering today and

479
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,799
it has nothing to do with

480
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,320
COPD because they're passing off

481
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,799
nonsmokers with COPD into the genetic

482
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,400
category that's what they're

483
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,240
doing you you see how it's going you see

484
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,000
what I mean how it's going in what

485
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,000
direction it is they're passing that off

486
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
to the genetic theory because if it's

487
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,080
not somebody who obviously smoked and

488
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,400
puffed all those all those heavy duty

489
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,559
cigarettes their whole life if it's not

490
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,679
that person and you didn't do that H you

491
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,720
know you go to the doctor I how can I

492
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,159
have COPD there lug problems I thought

493
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,360
it was just asthma and how am I having

494
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,280
this

495
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,919
COPD I never smoke

496
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,320
and they're just no well science and

497
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:06,960
research and studies say w it's it's

498
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,400
genetic now you got to it's your

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,360
genes oh my God dear Lord we're so going

500
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,080
nowhere to decades to come and decades

501
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,120
to

502
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,760
come it's really sad it's really sad not

503
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,880
not well you know this is what's going

504
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,559
on with your lung sex this is the virus

505
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,320
behind your lung sex this is the

506
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,760
bacteria behind your lung sax this is

507
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,240
this is your lymphatic system condition

508
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,360
this is what's going on inside your

509
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,039
liver this is what's really happening

510
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,960
here none of that no you won't hear any

511
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,880
of that you won't hear any of

512
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,559
that there there nothing like that it

513
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,600
won't even exist it won't even exist

514
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,480
instead it to be like no it's it's look

515
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,039
we just got to get you on all the

516
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,720
medications and look some medications

517
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,960
sustain people's lives when they and

518
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,440
that's the that's the good part of

519
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,520
conventional medicine Sometimes some

520
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,720
medications do help and sustain people's

521
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,240
lives with COPD oxygen 10 TKS you name

522
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,880
it but it's like it's like okay it's

523
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,720
just no it's genetic if you didn't

524
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,559
actually damage your lungs with some

525
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,919
kind of chemicals or

526
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,960
whatever so and that's where we are

527
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,799
we're nowhere it's called nowhere

528
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,080
absolutely nowhere is what it's called

529
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,559
and what year is it you think we're in

530
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,280
modern times you think that we're you

531
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,039
know where it's going on the BET look it

532
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,320
is amazing what computer technology can

533
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,480
do and Tech and the Tech world can do

534
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,200
it's absolutely astounding and

535
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,400
amazing absolutely but that goes ahead

536
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,880
that's moving ahead of what we do for

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,360
sickness and chronic illness that's just

538
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,400
moving way ahead in a different

539
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,919
field versus understanding what's wrong

540
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,120
with people in their sickness and their

541
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,240
diseases and illnesses and all their

542
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,720
symptoms that that that's enti that's

543
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,280
not even you don't you don't get fooled

544
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,799

science down pat right now we got

553
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,080
genetic technology down we got

554
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,679
everything down pat we just just listen

555
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,480

aren't we fixing all this how is this

597
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,279
possible and that's what happens to

598
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,559
every single

599
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:45,559
person who believes we have it all sewed

600
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,240
up when they're feeling pretty good and

601
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:48,799
they're young and they believe and they

602
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,840
don't have a lot of life experience and

603
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,799
they believe we have it all sewed

604
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,000
up and then

605
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,039
bam and it's happening more and more

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,600
years ago was just you know was just so

607
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,559
many people in the in their 20s and

608
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,039
their late

609
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,720
teens now it's truck loads and bus loads

610
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,000
and train

611
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,440
loads and they're

612
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,279
learning a hard hard way Hard Knocks and

613
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,159
they're learning wait a minute there's

614
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,440
no

615
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,080
answers and and I've been to the best

616
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,880
functional medicine doctor I've spent 50

617
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,799
80,000 50 60 70

618
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,279
$80,000 and I don't have

619
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,840
answers you know it's it's it's it's

620
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,120
unbelievable the amount of information

621
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,240
Spirit and I gave people that came to me

622
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,000
over the

623
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,120
years was more information than they can

624
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,200
get anywhere else even today right now

625
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,320
anywhere and they had not only the

626
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,000
answers but they recovered if they

627
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,880
applied themselves to What Spirit wanted

628
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,240
they recovered and thousands have and

629
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,000
thousands are now just with the books

630
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,440
alone and everything else

631
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,760
and I've had to dedicate my life to

632
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,360
these books and now I can't I can't work

633
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,840
with with anybody anymore and it breaks

634
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,240
my heart that it can't but I put it all

635
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,279
in the books and if you read them

636
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,200
carefully and you bring them to your

637
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:15,840
practitioners or you bring them to

638
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,880
people that can read it for you if you

639
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,760
can't read it you will find your way and

640
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,720
heal you will find your way and heal and

641
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,200
and if you have to bring it to

642
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,880
practitioner to interpret it you bring

643
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,600
it to a practitioner to interpret it and

644
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,120
whatever you need to

645
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,880
do but things are getting bad out there

646
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,240
and the answers have to come and people

647
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,240
have to get the answers and Tech and

648
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,320
Tech and computers and everything we got

649
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,960
going out right now and genes and the

650
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,880
theories in the medical world and the

651
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,720
technology we have and the best cars we

652
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,919
have isn't providing the answers in the

653
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,440
health realm for people it is the wild

654
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,559
west out there in the internet and is

655
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,240
the Wild West in the books out there and

656
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:59,799
it's and they're still avoiding trying

657
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240
to even look into what's going on and

658
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,760
when they do try to grab a little tidbit

659
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,360
because it gets popular because because

660
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
a popular

661
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,080
popularized can't say that word some of

662
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,440
the things like epine bar and other

663
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,240
things they take a little piece of it

664
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,960
and they don't want more than that so

665
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,559
people still get confused and go down

666
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,039
the wrong road and down a trap it's

667
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,720
unbelievable

668
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,720
COPD reminds me of this because when you

669
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,440
have

670
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,240
COPD and you're told it's genetic and

671
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,000
you didn't smoke and if you had it when

672
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,120
you smoke too I mean that's there's

673
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,279
people out there that smoke their whole

674
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,960
lives and don't get

675
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,440
COPD and then there's people who

676
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,760
smoke and get it quick with with a

677
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,279
fraction of their life smoking and

678
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,279
there's a reason for this everybody's

679
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,760
different everybody's different to what

680
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,000
degree or what can trigger it what how

681
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,600
it can get to the point it gets to what

682
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,720
happens and it it's unbelievable how it

683
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,480
works the uh you know so the whole point

684
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,880
with

685
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:05,240
COPD is that people they struggle they

686
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
get beaten down by it there's no answers

687
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,480
out there and we're going to cover that

688
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,120
right now that's what we're going to do

689
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,440
so let's talk about bacteria and viruses

690
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,320
because that's that's where I'm heading

691
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:19,399
now COPD is not only tripling but in in

692
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,200
about I'd say about another decade 10

693
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:25,159
years maybe 15 coming on 15 it's going

694
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
to quadruple but it's going to hit the

695
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,200
youth it's going to hit the youth it's

696
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
going to hit the young people and it's

697
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,159
going to hit the people in their 20s and

698
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,840
30s and it's going to be the first time

699
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,000
the first time in history I mean there

700
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,399
there is some random rare cases of

701
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,480
already that happening but it's going to

702
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:45,279
be a wave of hitting people in their 20s

703
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,320
and 30s COPD something that we think

704
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,919
about for 80y olds who smoked their

705
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,760
whole life that those days are gone

706
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,440
those days are gone the 80-year-olds

707
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,360
that smoked their whole life meaning

708
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,200
those days about COPD are gone it's not

709
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,640
also the 58-year-old either you know the

710
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,720
young 58-year old or the young

711
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,279
50-year-old which is you know happening

712
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,080
all the time with COPD it's moving it's

713
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:11,159
going to move into the 30s and 20s

714
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,840
that's why I'm doing the show I'm doing

715
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,480
the show for all reasons you know for

716
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,200
people that are older people that are

717
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,200
but the people that are younger to come

718
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,080
so what's going to happen it's always

719
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,880
going to be blamed on the genetic Factor

720
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,840
because people are smoking less and less

721
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,200
and less so we're we're phasing out the

722
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,440
smoking crowd we're phasing out

723
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,880
that crowd there's always going to be a

724
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,000
crowd that also you know they they

725
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,000
breathe in a lot of smoke they they have

726
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,120
fireplaces running all time they live in

727
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,080
certain areas of the world they have you

728
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,840
know their wood burning stoves but W

729
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,679
wood burning stoves you know also

730
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,159
release still a lot of smoke when you

731
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,679
have to open it throw more wood in it

732
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,919
and close it there's always the smoke

733
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,840
Factor going on um if you live near an

734
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,159
industrial area or an industrial city or

735
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,880
something like that and you're and

736
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,880
you're living in that you might be on

737
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,640
the downdraft some serious you know some

738
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,039
serious um gases and smoke and toxic

739
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,080
fumes and stuff like that that can

740
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,279
happen a lot of that that can be a big

741
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,760
part of CPD for a lot of people so that

742
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,159
you got all that going on too you got

743
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,320
the whole environmental thing and then

744
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,279
like I talked about in the environmental

745
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,960
show where in the Agland conventional

746
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,200
Agland all across the country all over

747
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,559
the country conventional Agland pick a

748
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,519
state pick a state and it's it's

749
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,679
happening there they there's there's

750
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,679
something called row covers if you've

751
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,640
gardened and you buy a row cover if you

752
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:35,960
ever garden and buy a row cover row

753
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,480
cover goes you know on your garden bed

754
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,840
and your plants can grow up through it

755
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,159
so you know you get a hole in there and

756
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,679
the area and the plant grows through it

757
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:49,720
keeps the weeds down well row covers are

758
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,720
used in conventional Agriculture and and

759
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,880
and and not when you see conventional

760
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,840
agricultural um photos and everything

761
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,960
like that you won't see the row covers

762
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,480
but they're there in conventional

763
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,679
growing they're there I noticed that

764
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,760
they you usually see the field when it's

765
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,320
all green and you know all the different

766
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,360
cabbage heads are sticking out you know

767
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,519
as far as like Green Revolution stuff

768
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,720
and conventional farming and you know

769
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,200
you see broccoli going miles and miles

770
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,519
and miles and you you just you you know

771
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,880
you see it but you don't see any row

772
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,799
covers you don't see any row covers but

773
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,559
but they were there they were there and

774
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,240
most likely removed or um some don't use

775
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,080
them but for the majority they are used

776
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,360
these row covers and what happens is

777
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,080
here's what goes on the fields all get

778
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,360
sprayed with pesticides Mercury Laden

779
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,960
pesticides copper Coop dangerous copper

780
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,919
Laden pesticides neuro antagonists All

781
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,679
chemical neuro antagonist chemicals all

782
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,120
in the pesticides Dangerous Ones or

783
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
skull and crossbones on all the

784
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,120
pesticide herbicide rodenticide

785
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,240
fungicide larvicide um containers so you

786
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,080
got the skull and crossbones you got the

787
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,399
it's literally that mean means death if

788
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,200
you go near that thing and you don't

789
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:06,159
have a hazmat suit on and you're loaded

790
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:08,039
and you're opening that can you can die

791
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,360
that's why that's on there like that if

792
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,399
the can rolled over and dumped the big

793
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,559
can rolled over and dumped and it hit

794
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:17,440
your legs you're dead that's why there's

795
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,039
a skull and crossbone on there so they

796
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,519
have to take that dilute it with water

797
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,600
fill it into all the tractors and the

798
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,080
big and the big you know um containers

799
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,440
on the tractors and they got all the

800
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,880
sprayers in the op you know all the

801
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,360
hydraulic sprayers and everything and

802
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,320
they're spraying the fields if they

803
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,039
don't do it by planes they don't do it

804
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,679
by planes as much and and they do it

805
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,279
mostly by

806
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,200
tractors and all that pesticide is going

807
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,960
on the row covers it's all going on the

808
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,080
row saturating the row covers saturating

809
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,559
the row covers all year long or all

810
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,760
during that growing period whether it's

811
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,720
three months or two months or five

812
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,919
months depending what they're growing

813
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,559
and what they're

814
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,200
doing and then they get when they when

815
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,120
they harvest after they harvest they

816
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,919
gather all the row covers it's all

817
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:01,039
plastic and they pile it up in gigantic

818
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:04,399
m s in every state in every part of the

819
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,639
country and they burn it they throw fuel

820
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:12,880
on it and they burn it and this is one

821
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:15,600
reason why COPD is worsening at this

822
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,600
point it's worsening at this point

823
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,639
because of this reason right here and

824
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,679
this is like a like an

825
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:26,960
unbelievable

826
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,720
illegal way of doing things but they all

827
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,919
do do it and it's usually protected by

828
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,880
hands you know people passing money

829
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:40,039
along under the table but it's it's far

830
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,200
worse than any car pollution it's far

831
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,240
worse than some of the factories that

832
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,799
are spewing out crap out of the top of

833
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,240
those factories and Industrial sections

834
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:52,240
of the world it is actually worse it's

835
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,679
it's these massive plumes of smoke and

836
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
why wouldn't anybody see this because

837
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,919
it's called the white smoke so it's it's

838
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,679
just the burning plastic

839
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,039
and the Plastics are mostly white mostly

840
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,559
white so it's a white smoke that goes up

841
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,320
in the air and it just burn and they

842
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,440
burn it everywhere all over the country

843
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:14,200
and what are they doing they're making

844
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,880
us sick and no one's allowed to go near

845
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,360
it no meaning no one's allowed to learn

846
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,600
about it no one's allowed to understand

847
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,639
it no one's allowed to do anything it's

848
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,679
a it's it's a practice that it it makes

849
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,960
the GMO thing look

850
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,159
ridiculous look ridiculous you couldn't

851
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
even

852
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,320
imagine and you know and and when they

853
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,679
it's unbelievable it's unbelievable and

854
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,480
that's what's happening in the country

855
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,880
that's actually part of why COPD is on

856
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
the rise so we have to protect ourself

857
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,600
so we can get around that it's it's why

858
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,440
asthma's on the rise like never before

859
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,240
it's part of why asthma is on the rise

860
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,399
like never before and other lung

861
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,080
problems are on the rise like never

862
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,440
before like never

863
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,880
before so what happens here is that that

864
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,200
we have these lung problems and

865
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,639
different reasons why and varieties of

866
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,240
why if you have a bacterial infection

867
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,399
that's chronically in the lung which is

868
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,840
Strep strep can get in the lung all

869
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,200
these different varieties of strep all

870
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,159
these different varieties so many

871
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,080
mutations at this point and we take

872
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,639
antibiotics and it mutates it more and

873
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,000
take the antibiotics it mutates it more

874
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,799
makes the strep stronger stronger

875
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,320
stronger stronger that could lead to a

876
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,000
COPD case we can have underlying thing

877
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,519
is Strep they'll never know they'll

878
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,720
never they can't tell they can cut a

879
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,880
piece of your lung out they're still not

880
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,720
going to find it

881
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,000
because no one cares so the study and

882
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,720
the the money is not going there the

883
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,960
money is going into genes medicine is is

884
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,519
at a drought point right now it's at a

885
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,840
drought point that means that anything

886
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,480
productive in medicine to move people

887
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,720
forward in chronic illness is dried up

888
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,919
the Ws are dried up and money can't be

889
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,399
dumped into anything anymore unless it's

890
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,120
bogus

891
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,039
alternative interest groups wanting to

892
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,159
fund a trendy concept to confuse people

893
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,639
more and then you know and that that's

894
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,240
that's that's a different situation

895
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,919
those aren't drying up they come out all

896
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,679
the time but in conventional medicine

897
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,720
the well has dried up it all has to

898
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,599
funnel to genes so any money involved

899
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,760
has to go into genetic

900
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
technology cloning and everything else

901
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,399
and just but you know whatever it has to

902
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,280
just all be genetic no matter what the

903
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,720
case or what the direction is and so you

904
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,079
know there's no money in cutting out a

905
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,879
piece of lung and figuring out what

906
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,000
bacteria teria is what's causing the

907
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,520
problem or in a case of viruses there a

908
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,639
lot of different herpetic viruses they

909
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,079
get also into the lung area through the

910
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,200
lymphatic system so there's a lot of

911
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
Epstein bars different varieties of

912
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,079
Epstein bar not everybody with Epstein

913
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,440
bar is going to have one thing or

914
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,520
another just so you know a lot of people

915
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,000
with Epstein bar they'll have chronic

916
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,000
fatigue a lot of they'll have Hashimoto

917
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,679
thyroiditis they'll have ra there's

918
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,280
different varieties of Epstein bar

919
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,320
something that medical science research

920
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,480
has no idea about whatsoever until I

921
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,560
came out with the information there's

922
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,440
over 60 varieties of Epstein bar and

923
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,440
so and there will be more varieties as

924
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,720
they mutate and they grow so move

925
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,720
forward so anyway the bottom line is I

926
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,920
say so a lot sorry about that the bottom

927
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,000
line is that we get we can get a viral

928
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,640
infection inside the lymphatic system it

929
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,040
comes out of the liver the viruses sit

930
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,119
inside the liver so your Epstein bar

931
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,960
will sit inside your liver hhv6 will sit

932
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,440
inside the liver

933
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:24,119
hhv7 hhv7 um undiscovered hhv1

934
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,800
undiscovered hhv1 undiscovered hhv 12 13

935
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:28,800
14 undiscovered hhv 15 undiscovered

936
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,760
hh16 and and their subgroups meaning

937
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,760
their

938
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,440
mutations so what happens is these

939
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,680
viruses sit inside people's livers they

940
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,280
move into the lymphatic system over time

941
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,599
over the years it's different kindes of

942
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,880
types of herpetic

943
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,200
viruses they create mucus in the

944
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,960
lymphatic

945
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,319
system and when they create mucus and a

946
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,680
backlog of mucus

947
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,839
continuously it causes oxygen problems

948
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,520
meaning the whole thing with oxygen

949
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,200
switching off with carbon dioxide just

950
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,640
to get the oxygen and carbon dioxide

951
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,079
Exchange in the lung in the lung tissue

952
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,480
in the lung sack so you got the oxygen

953
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,839
carbon dioxide exchange it it it creates

954
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,000
mucus mucus gets in the way of that

955
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,599
exchange so then you get this these

956
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,319
viral these

957
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,680
viruses that produce a lot of Gunk and

958
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:24,280
junk and byproduct not necessarily

959
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,480
neurotoxins because there's different

960
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,160
varieties of viruses you got the hh10

961
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,720
like said you got different ones and you

962
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,119
got H6

963
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,119
and and so what happens is and some of

964
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,000
these people with COPD now they do have

965
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,400
neurotoxic symptoms too that I always

966
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,280
talk about from Epstein bars and

967
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,760
everything else so they're getting

968
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,839
multiple symptoms they got the

969
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,280
neuropathy they got the neuralgia

970
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,920
neuropathy they got different things

971
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,599
going on they got fibromyalgia and they

972
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,000
got COPD they got aches and pain so it

973
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,000
it all does come out in the

974
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,280
end but the whole point is you got this

975
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,480
viral stuff that's never going to get

976
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,480
researched

977
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,640
ever and then you got the bacterial

978
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,400
stuff like the strep strep aacle and

979
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:06,640
strep cacus and you got that going on so

980
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,160
the streps and the different kinds of

981
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,839
streps sit in the lungs itself and sit

982
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,400
in the lung sacks when they sit in the

983
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:16,560
lung sacks they're they're they're

984
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,760
actually creating the lung

985
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,599
damage and then and then also Epstein

986
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,160
bars tend to also get into lungs too

987
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,280
they leave the lymphatic vessels and

988
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,839
they they get up into the lungs they

989
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,960
create lung

990
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,440
scarring you know the scars and lungs

991
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,720
and create little cysts and little

992
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,319
pockets and little scars and they do

993
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,480
lung scarring it's all a mystery to

994
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,960
research and science they don't know how

995
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,000
all that scarring happens they don't

996
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,560
know how all the lung cysts happen

997
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
happen you know the non-cancerous ones

998
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,920
and everything else they don't even know

999
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,079
how the cancerous ones happen but it's

1000
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,680
like and and what happens is that you

1001
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,920
know all this is from viral and

1002
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,319
bacterial stuff so when you're when

1003
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:58,680
you're breathing in these white plumes

1004
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:00,640
of smoke environmentally that are in

1005
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,240
just are they're everywhere and no one

1006
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,079
knows about it no one knows about it

1007
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,680
it's just blowing

1008
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,920
around that can trick because there's

1009
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,119
pesticides in that white plume of smoke

1010
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,599
coming off those rad covers all those

1011
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,319
skull and bone pesticides I was talking

1012
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,040
about that are saturated on the rad

1013
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:19,280
cover so when they burn them they're

1014
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,079
they're creating new

1015
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,280
chemicals new chemicals through burning

1016
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,520
those pesticides on the

1017
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,720
Plastics and when you breathe that in

1018
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,119
and you got the

1019
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,560
viruses and you got the lymphatic mucus

1020
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,440
and everything else it just it just

1021
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,839
feeds it those chemicals feed it because

1022
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,560
you breathe it in and it's going into

1023
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:40,119
the lung just like somebody smoking a

1024
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,800
cigarette going into the lung and then

1025
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,520
feeding any kind of bacteria virus or

1026
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,839
pathogen and then more more Scar Tissue

1027
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,599
occurs more lung sack

1028
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,280
damage and then not only that mucus lots

1029
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,000
of mucus forming everywhere then take

1030
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,560
the

1031
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,480
foods people want eat dairy they want to

1032
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:05,400
eat cheese the new longevity food

1033
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,240
cheese it's a new longevity food sure

1034
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,319
yeah I'll buy into that one cheese feeds

1035
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,119
every virus and pathogen in the

1036
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:15,880
book and this is the bottom line I don't

1037
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,480
care how you know how it was raised how

1038
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,119
the animal was raised or anything like

1039
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,240
that or harvest it the che I mean the I

1040
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:25,760
don't I don't care how everything was

1041
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,480
done but the bottom line is so you got

1042
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,640
the cheese you got the milk you got the

1043
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,240
dairy you got all that you can't do that

1044
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,160
with COPD so one thing you have to do I

1045
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,760
would even go plant-based with COPD I

1046
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,119
wouldn't even do an animal protein

1047
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,359
because when it comes down to your lungs

1048
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,119
you don't want to mess around you just

1049
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,960
don't want to mess around it's a lot of

1050
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,359
people that will they'll give up a

1051
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,040
certain thing they'll give up they'll

1052
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:50,280
give up something they'll give up

1053
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,640
something but there are people now with

1054
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,960
COPD because it's a new generation of

1055
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,680
COPD it's a new generation it's a

1056
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,960
younger generation and they tend to give

1057
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:02,000
up more in the older days remember in

1058
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,480
the 80s and the 90s early 2000s in the

1059
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,440
older days people with COPD they they

1060
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,040
you know the chain smokers and really

1061
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,200
old and all that was going on and they

1062
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,720
would smoke to the end it would smoke to

1063
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,480
the end even with COPD it doesn't matter

1064
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,240
you have an oxygen tank at the same time

1065
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,119
you're smoking while on oxygen that was

1066
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,960
that that's that's how it was done

1067
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:27,880
that's how it was done now we got a lot

1068
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,240
of younger people now and the world's

1069
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,680
Chang a little bit better for the all

1070
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,680
kinds of reasons and you know and and

1071
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,000
younger people are like well I'm going

1072
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,160
to quit smoking so they do throw their

1073
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400
cigarettes away and then you got the

1074
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,000
young people that are told it's

1075
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,560
jeans because they don't know anything I

1076
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,040
just described to you just earlier about

1077
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,960
COPD so they don't know anything about

1078
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,400
it so they so they just throw the Jean

1079
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,400
thing at you and those people they tend

1080
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,680
to they tend to you know they they will

1081
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,920
change something if you tell them to

1082
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,880
change something they will eat better

1083
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,000
I with COPD I wouldn't even mess around

1084
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,280
I would go 100% plant-based 100%

1085
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,680
plantbased is what I would

1086
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,680
do even if it means you're high fat

1087
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,640
plant-based even if it means you're

1088
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,880
eating too many avocados too many nuts

1089
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,960
and seeds too many oils you're eating

1090
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,880
you're eating you know even if it

1091
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,880
means you're eating something you know

1092
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,079
you're eating quinoa even if it means

1093
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,680
you're eating quinoa even if it means

1094
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,079
you know which is actually isn't the

1095
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,160
worst grain at all and somebody out

1096
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,520
there is going to say oh it's not a

1097
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,200
grain it's a seed everything's a

1098
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,480
seed so here's the thing so here's the

1099
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,680
here's the deal here's the

1100
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,200
deal um everything's a seed even if it

1101
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,040
won't grow even if a seed won't grow

1102
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,520
it's a seed even if it won't grow just

1103
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,720
so you know don't get that confused that

1104
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,920
was something that's been going

1105
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,599
around but um quinoa like even if it's

1106
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,880
quinoa even if it's millet even if

1107
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,280
you're eating Millet every day and

1108
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,800
oatmeal every day you're better off

1109
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,000
doing that than eating an animal product

1110
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,880
with COPD I'm not trying to rip down the

1111
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,839
Animal product world or ripped down I

1112
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,079
know many of you you're doing animal

1113
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,000
proteins that's not what it's about if

1114
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:12,040
you have

1115
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,560
COPD you just want to get rid of the

1116
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,680
animal proteins way too heavy on the

1117
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,280
liver way too heavy on the

1118
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,839
liver because the more bog down the

1119
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,400
liver is the more lymphatic system is

1120
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,000
going to get bogged down the more mucus

1121
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,680
is going to be caused the more mucus is

1122
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,160
going to form and go up through the lmag

1123
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,640
system push up into the lungs and it's

1124
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,599
just not going to help that's one reason

1125
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,640
the other reason is the more animal

1126
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,880
products you eat I'm just saying like

1127
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,079
meat

1128
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,920
chicken even fish turkey whatever the

1129
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,280
more you eat of that or pork the less

1130
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,599
room you have for the foods that we're

1131
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,160
going to talk about next that restore

1132
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,920
lung sacks here's here's how it works

1133
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,359
here's how it works um you know I'm not

1134
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,680
on anybody's side with the food diets

1135
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:59,880
but I'm going to tell you what happens

1136
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,839
here with animal protein it doesn't fix

1137
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,760
things it doesn't hurt things in many

1138
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,760
ways and some ways it does but it

1139
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,880
doesn't fix things just so you know

1140
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,280
what's fixing anything is everything

1141
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,079
else you're eating so when you got all

1142
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,280
these different autoimmune diets and

1143
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,319
they're all filled with animal protein

1144
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,559
and everything else what's helping the

1145
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:23,880
person what's helping them at all is

1146
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:26,599
they got rid of all the garbage number

1147
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,760
one number two if they're making room

1148
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,079
for a green juice they're making room if

1149
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,079
you know they got rid of so much garbage

1150
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,359
that they have room for a smoothie even

1151
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,040
if it's not the right kind of smoothie

1152
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,599
they got room for a green juice they got

1153
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,880
room for more cucumbers they got room

1154
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,480
for salads green salads they got room

1155
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,359
for these things those are the things

1156
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,520
that heal damaged lungs I'm not saying I

1157
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,079
have something against the animal

1158
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,160
protein for you if you're really sold on

1159
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,680
it I'm just saying I would get rid of it

1160
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,000
100% one if that if if it was me I would

1161
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,839
get rid of it 100%

1162
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,359
gone gone if I had if I was somebody

1163
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,760
eating animal protein with

1164
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,960
COPD because you know what it is when

1165
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,880
you're take you got to take your lung

1166
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,040
serious you need every antioxidant every

1167
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,960
antioxidant you can possibly get in any

1168
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,240
way shape or

1169
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,599
form anthocyanins undiscovered

1170
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,599
antioxidants there's hundreds and

1171
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,920
hundreds of undiscovered antioxidants in

1172
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:27,960
foods that aren't animal products that

1173
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,079
you need to restore your lungs you need

1174
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,760
melons to restore your lungs you need

1175
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,480
melons you need papaya to store your L

1176
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,040
restore your lungs foods are critical

1177
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,720
you need berries you need wild

1178
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,480
blueberries to restore your lungs if

1179
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,240
you're busy eating an egg breakfast or

1180
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,599
you're busy having a turkey sausage

1181
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,680
breakfast healthy turkey

1182
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,760
sausage and you don't have your wild

1183
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,520
blueberries you just lost an opportunity

1184
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,680
to restore your lungs just lost an

1185
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,000
opportunity to restore your lungs plus

1186
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,680
it's just too it's too much high fat on

1187
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,920
top of it way too much high fat and that

1188
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,319
doesn't help your lungs either because

1189
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,000
it burdens down your liver here's the

1190
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,640
thing the higher fat that's in your

1191
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,960
bloodstream so if you're going to do all

1192
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,720
animal products when you have

1193
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,480
COPD when you do high fat which is

1194
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,760
animal products if you do really high

1195
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,040
fat and if you're vegan or vegetarian

1196
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,319
you can do high fat too if you're

1197
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,960
vegetarian you could have tons of oils

1198
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,559
you I've known vegetarians they dumping

1199
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,920
all the sesame oil they're just C

1200
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:27,200
they're cooking their vegetarian dish

1201
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,960
and they dump a whole you you know like

1202
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,839
ounces of sesame oil in there and it's

1203
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,920
filled with sesame oil and they got they

1204
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:36,720
got lots of tofu in there which is which

1205
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,960
has a lot of fat in tofu there's a lot

1206
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,720
there's a high volume of fat soy oil in

1207
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,880
there soybean oil in there so they got

1208
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,400
that and then you know with with all

1209
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,160
that with all that they even have you

1210
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,119
know they even have dairy they even have

1211
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,079
they throw goats milk in there and they

1212
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,680
throw whatever and so just a large

1213
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,920
amount of fat and that's not good so

1214
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,920
when you're talking about animal protein

1215
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,559
eaters too meaning just we're all big in

1216
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,920
animal protein so much fat what happens

1217
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,520
is it gets rid of your oxygen in your

1218
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,640
blood what I'm saying is it minimizes

1219
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,920
your blood oxygen the whole

1220
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,520
point is keeping that oxygen getting

1221
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,760
into your blood and having that carbon

1222
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,720
dioxide

1223
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,480
transfer that's the whole point so when

1224
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,680
your diet is high in fat you can't do

1225
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,280
that anymore you're losing oxygen so you

1226
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,280
go plant-based 100% even if it's higher

1227
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,000
fat plant-based it's still it'll still

1228
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,079
give you more oxygen in the bloodstream

1229
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,359
plant-based 100% And you need room for

1230
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:37,079
the right Foods you need room for

1231
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,599
peppermint tea ginger tea garlic onions

1232
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,440
you need room to be hydrated with a

1233
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,240
little coconut water you need room to be

1234
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,200
hydrated with lemon water you need the

1235
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,480
melons the berries you need lots of

1236
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,200
apples you need the papaya you need the

1237
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,559
mangoes to help with the the the

1238
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,160
keratinoid to help restore the lung

1239
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:56,200
tissue the antioxidants the amount of

1240
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,960
beta carotene carotenoids and anti an

1241
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,440
oxidants all of that and the pigments in

1242
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,839
there that are loaded with antioxidants

1243
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,280
that they don't even study yet because

1244
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:05,240
you can't break them down they're not

1245
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,800
they're it's not something you can

1246
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,440
separate and break down easy you need a

1247
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,160
lot of money and a lot of science and

1248
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,040
research and a lot of real honest

1249
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,720
hardworking people trying to figure out

1250
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,839
what's inside these things it's really

1251
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,240
difficult you need the celery juice cuz

1252
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,920
the mineral salts are critical to

1253
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,480
restoring the lungs and knock down

1254
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,800
viruses and bacteria you need the

1255
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,599
cucumbers lots of cucumber juice when

1256
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,960
somebody with COPD they on cucumber

1257
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:29,800
juice if you're sitting there eating an

1258
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,240
egg and sausage breakfast you're not

1259
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,720
going to get the cucumber juice in you

1260
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,200
there's no way and if you do do a

1261
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,640
cucumber juice after having an egg and

1262
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,040
sausage breakfast what's going to happen

1263
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,640
is it's not going to help as

1264
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,640
much so you want to go 100% plant-based

1265
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,800
if it's too hard for you with COPD I

1266
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,319
understand completely then keep your

1267
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,960
animal products to one a day and start

1268
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,040
bringing in some avocado to try to

1269
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,119
offset it try to do some different

1270
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,720
things I'd rather have you on quinoa I'd

1271
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,839
rather have you on Millet I'd rather

1272
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:59,280
have you on oatmeal I'd rather have you

1273
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:02,400
on things if it means it gets you kind

1274
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,920
of off more of the animal products with

1275
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,319
COPD it's just one of those it's one of

1276
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,160
those illnesses it's one of those

1277
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,359
diseases illnesses dysfunctions

1278
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,040
disorders it's one of those where you

1279
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:14,839
have to have your blood fat a little bit

1280
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,480
lower or a lot lower so oxygen really

1281
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:18,800
gets into the bloodstream helps you heal

1282
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,040
on all kinds of levels it's a big deal

1283
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,119
I've been able to reverse COPD in so

1284
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,119
many people and very easily and there's

1285
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,599
different stages of COPD depends on what

1286
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,880
stage somebody's in too you want to

1287
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,480
catch it earlier you don't want to be in

1288
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,400
stage four but you can still keep

1289
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,240
somebody in stage four alive and going

1290
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,720
if you do the right things so you can

1291
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,640
keep somebody in stage four here on the

1292
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,839
planet alive and that's what you want to

1293
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,040
do here's here's here's something that's

1294
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,000

for COPD time tea kills the strep that's

1306
00:49:08,839 --> 00:49:13,200
in a lot of people's lungs that cause

1307
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,760
COPD the younger people all have strep

1308
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,480
in their lungs the people that are

1309
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,559
getting COPD and Asthma and they don't

1310
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,799
get diagnosed with COPD yet because

1311
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:23,760
they're just they're just told they have

1312
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:25,839
asthma at the beginning those people in

1313
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,440
their 20s that's that's strep in inside

1314

the lungs do the time tea vitamin C lots

1315
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,400

in liquid form but nettle leaf tea very

1347
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,599
important peppermint tea every single

1348
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,280
day you got to do if you're somebody

1349
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:41,520
sensitive to garlic and onions then just

1350
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,319
you know don't use them but if you're

1351
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,839
not sensitive you do garlic and onions

1352
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:47,920
it helps move the mucus around so that

1353
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:50,480
the exchange of carbon dioxide and

1354
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,880
oxygen occur hydration is important like

1355
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,720
I said before you got the coconut water

1356
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,160
you got the lemon water you got you know

1357
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,880
and and that's why I like melons it's

1358
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,839
really good that's a good one for people

1359
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,559

1371
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,839
the Animal product products down because

1372
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,160

Foods if you have to move to grains you

1377

do the like I said the quinoa and the

1378
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,400
Millet and the oatmeal if it's too hard

1379
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,880
to do all this you go into hummus just

1380
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,079
do a little hummus if you feel like you

1381
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,760
can hack a little bit of hummus

1382
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:45,760
chickpeas garbanzo bean hummus you know

can use those you can make your own

1387
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,079
where you only put a little bit of

1388
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,960
tahini in there or something like that

1389
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,000
or a little bit of olive oil oil in

1390
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,280
inside there or you can make a hemp seed

1391
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,880
chickpea hemp seed garbanza meat bean

1392
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,520
hummus where you take garbanza beans you

1393
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,240
throw it in the blender and you throw

1394
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,000
some hem seeds in there now I know you

1395
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,240
know I know you don't have to look if

1396
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,559
you're somebody who wants to go plant

1397
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,400
Bas you do want to do that you don't

1398
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,640
have to have hummus you could just go

1399
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,559
you can go potatoes potatoes are even

1400
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,200
amazing for somebody with COPD you do

1401
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:20,760
the celery juices in the morning you do

1402
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,520
the fruit smoothies maybe even the heavy

1403
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,359
metal detox then you move on to lunch

1404
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,359
you have potatoes for lunch with a salad

1405
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,359
you have some Yukon Golds you have some

1406
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,000
red potatoes you have some rusted you

1407
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,280
have some um you know uh some purple

1408
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,960
potatoes steam them up throw them on top

1409
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,599
of your salad for lunch in the afternoon

1410
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,200
you eat some apples after that you you

1411
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:41,960
know you have another celery juice or a

1412
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,960
cucumber juice it would even be good

1413
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,720
cucumber juice maybe some coconut water

1414
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:48,000
the end of the night have another salad

1415
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,960
maybe throw in two one two avocados on

1416
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,440
top of your salad maybe have some

1417
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,640
butternut squash on there maybe have

1418
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,319
something like that you can do that you

1419
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:58,599
can do that and be 100% %

1420
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,839
plant-based and while you're plant-based

1421
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,359
like that you'll get higher oxygen

1422
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:03,480
levels in your blood because your fats

1423
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:06,400
will be

1424
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,160
lower and then you'll be able to start

1425
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,440
getting your life back eventually even

1426
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,720
doctors end up taking you off of

1427
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,240
medications when you start getting

1428
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:16,040
better if you're stage one stage two

1429
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,480
stage three uh COPD if you're stage four

1430
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,440
depending on what's going on and all

1431
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,760
that you're up against and and

1432
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,839
everything else it could at least keep

1433
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,319
you there and maybe even reverse it a

1434
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,880
little bit I have reversed stage four

1435
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,359
