[665.28 - 671.60] give me a thumbs up
[668.16 - 672.88] doing some carrot right now
[671.60 - 674.96] okay
[672.88 - 676.32] so we got some carrots
[674.96 - 677.52] what i like to do with carrots is what
[676.32 - 679.52] i'm gonna do is i'm gonna cut it this
[677.52 - 681.76] way let me get the back of the carrot
[679.52 - 681.76] off
[682.56 - 686.88] i don't like the carrot top right the
[684.96 - 689.68] carrot top cause a lot of times you'll
[686.88 - 691.68] see the carrot top gets green
[689.68 - 694.00] around the edges because when they grow
[691.68 - 695.84] carrots the carrot sticks up
[694.00 - 697.84] out of the ground a little bit and it
[695.84 - 699.52] gets that green color and i don't like
[697.84 - 700.84] that that part you shouldn't eat with
[699.52 - 704.00] carrots
[700.84 - 705.60] right so i like just cutting the top off
[704.00 - 707.76] a touch if you guys are all right with
[705.60 - 709.28] that all right i like splitting the
[707.76 - 712.32] carrot
[709.28 - 712.32] just like this you see
[712.72 - 715.76] like doing this
[714.40 - 717.68] right just splitting them down the
[715.76 - 718.80] center right
[717.68 - 721.20] and
[718.80 - 722.80] there we go and then what i do
[721.20 - 724.24] is i'll take all the carrots together
[722.80 - 727.44] i'll put them all together like this
[724.24 - 730.56] right and i'll do this right
[727.44 - 733.12] and just cut through them
[730.56 - 735.44] so and i'll make the carrot pieces small
[733.12 - 737.28] enough
[735.44 - 739.60] you can make them big you can have big
[737.28 - 741.04] hunky carrots in there it's fine
[739.60 - 742.96] you want big hunky carrots in there
[741.04 - 745.28] that's fine let me get the carrots in
[742.96 - 746.40] we're making the stew now
[745.28 - 748.56] nice
[746.40 - 750.48] just got to throw some garlic in there

[1740.16 - 1745.12] the problem is is this little guy

[1745.12 - 1749.52] sits inside everybody
[1747.04 - 1751.04] hhv-6 hhv-7
[1749.52 - 1754.08] hhv-8

[1754.08 - 1760.80] right simplex one simplex two shingles
[1757.16 - 1762.80] cytomegalovirus hhv 10 through 16
[1760.80 - 1765.44] undiscovered right
[1762.80 - 1767.44] all the different viruses that people
[1765.44 - 1770.40] walk around with and then the bacteria
[1767.44 - 1771.52] struck the cactus
[1770.40 - 1773.12] you don't think you have strep in your
[1771.52 - 1776.24] system what about the strep throat you
[1773.12 - 1777.68] had years ago in college
[1776.24 - 1779.60] what about i never went to college by
[1777.68 - 1782.32] the way but
[1779.60 - 1783.52] so my friends did and yeah they always
[1782.32 - 1785.68] got the strep throat and they'd be
[1783.52 - 1786.88] calling me up like i got nowhere sore
[1785.68 - 1789.28] throat
[1786.88 - 1791.44] was where you're partying all night
[1789.28 - 1793.52] and then you know strep throat right
[1791.44 - 1794.64] that's one thing right there
[1793.52 - 1796.48] mono
[1794.64 - 1798.24] people have mono that's the epstein bar
[1796.48 - 1800.80] right but people think i don't have
[1798.24 - 1803.36] strep well then uti's bladder infections
[1800.80 - 1806.24] overactive bladder how about that so
[1803.36 - 1809.52] overactive bladder utis bladder
[1806.24 - 1813.44] infections chronic sinusitis acne
[1809.52 - 1814.80] i repeat acne is streptococcus in your
[1813.44 - 1817.44] lymphatic
[1814.80 - 1817.44] system
[1817.52 - 1822.96] acne is streptococcus
[1819.76 - 1825.44] in your lymphatic system
[1822.96 - 1827.52] if you have acne
[1825.44 - 1829.84] you have streptococcus in your liver and
[1827.52 - 1831.84] lymphatic system and the real place it's
[1829.84 - 1834.32] in is in your liver and then it ends up
[1831.84 - 1836.64] feeding up into the lymphatic system
[1834.32 - 1838.72] that's the streptococcus and then when
[1836.64 - 1840.40] your cycle comes out medical medium
[1838.72 - 1842.16] information when your cycle comes out
[1840.40 - 1844.00] when your cycle's happening menstruation
[1842.16 - 1846.00] is occurring for women your immune
[1844.00 - 1847.68] system drops
[1846.00 - 1849.20] eighty percent of your immune system
[1847.68 - 1852.56] goes to your reproductive system and
[1849.20 - 1852.56] then the acne breaks out
[1852.80 - 1857.76] because you can't contain your immune
[1854.48 - 1862.00] system can't contain the streptococcus
[1857.76 - 1865.00] so now your your acne is breaking out
[1862.00 - 1865.00] right
[1866.32 - 1870.00] okay what i love about the anti-bug
[1868.00 - 1872.24] cleanse
[1870.00 - 1873.44] it's not hormones what a crock of crap
[1872.24 - 1874.96] that is
[1873.44 - 1876.72] unbelievable
[1874.96 - 1879.36] the one thing about conventional
[1876.72 - 1881.60] medicine is it brainwashes alternative
[1879.36 - 1883.04] medicine you think alternative medicine
[1881.60 - 1884.64] is different than conventional medicine
[1883.04 - 1886.88] when it really isn't
[1884.64 - 1888.40] the difference is you know yeah they use
[1886.88 - 1889.84] different treatments that's the
[1888.40 - 1892.56] difference right
[1889.84 - 1895.52] but rea and it's one of the differences
[1892.56 - 1897.52] but the problem is the whole
[1895.52 - 1899.44] trickery pattern that happened from
[1897.52 - 1900.72] conventional medicine was to blame women
[1899.44 - 1901.76] for their hormones for everything
[1900.72 - 1903.04] anything that happened was their
[1901.76 - 1904.72] hormones you got anxiety at your
[1903.04 - 1907.12] hormones
[1904.72 - 1909.36] if you got depression at your hormones
[1907.12 - 1911.44] if you got fatigue get your hormones
[1909.36 - 1913.36] if you got acne it's your hormones
[1911.44 - 1915.36] everything was blamed on hormones this
[1913.36 - 1918.08] was a pattern this was a pattern
[1915.36 - 1920.24] conventional medicine did to women was
[1918.08 - 1922.56] blame everything on their hormones and
[1920.24 - 1924.40] what it did in the 1950s is it turned
[1922.56 - 1925.84] this thing into it where then all of a
[1924.40 - 1928.16] sudden
[1925.84 - 1931.12] all the men in the 1950s were like it's
[1928.16 - 1933.12] your hormones it's your hormones honey
[1931.12 - 1936.08] honey it's your hormones
[1933.12 - 1937.36] stop it stop acting crazy honey stop
[1936.08 - 1939.20] acting nuts
[1937.36 - 1940.72] your anxiety is your hormones the doctor
[1939.20 - 1943.52] said it's your hormones honey your
[1940.72 - 1945.52] depression is your hormones
[1943.52 - 1948.32] that's what happened that was the 1950s
[1945.52 - 1950.08] right alternative medicine
[1948.32 - 1952.56] i'll turn the medicine
[1950.08 - 1954.88] it's like it's like it it is it's just
[1952.56 - 1957.44] basically an echo of conventional
[1954.88 - 1959.28] medicine in so many ways right here's
[1957.44 - 1961.20] one example you talk to an alternative
[1959.28 - 1963.20] functional medicine doctor and you say
[1961.20 - 1965.52] well wait a minute
[1963.20 - 1967.28] a doctor it what's what's the is
[1965.52 - 1968.48] the shingles chicken pox and the
[1967.28 - 1971.28] alternative doctor will be like
[1968.48 - 1973.60] functional doctor bill uh yes um the
[1971.28 - 1976.72] chickenpox virus is the shingles no it's
[1973.60 - 1978.96] not it's two different viruses they echo
[1976.72 - 1980.80] everything from conventional medicine
[1978.96 - 1982.64] everything's echoed from it you think
[1980.80 - 1984.24] alternative medicine is just something
[1982.64 - 1985.28] completely different
[1984.24 - 1986.40] sure
[1985.28 - 1988.80] and then when you go to alternative
[1986.40 - 1990.88] doctors in the clinics in the medical
[1988.80 - 1992.64] prestigious medical clinics that you
[1990.88 - 1995.20] know the ones that are conventional the
[1992.64 - 1996.56] ones right you go to alternative doctors
[1995.20 - 1997.92] and i'll say you go to alternative
[1996.56 - 1999.36] doctors at the mayo clinic you go to
[1997.92 - 2001.12] alter alternative doctors at the
[1999.36 - 2002.80] cleveland clinic you could alter an
[2001.12 - 2004.56] alternative doc doctors see your side
[2002.80 - 2006.16] night whatever you go whatever you go
[2004.56 - 2007.44] those all turn doctors they're playing
[2006.16 - 2008.64] by rules
[2007.44 - 2012.24] um
[2008.64 - 2015.12] we can't do that for you sir or ma'am
[2012.24 - 2017.36] nope we're under yep we're under the
[2015.12 - 2019.76] rules here
[2017.36 - 2023.12] yeah we're alternative physicians
[2019.76 - 2025.12] but we're under the rules
[2023.12 - 2027.36] you think you got an alternative they're
[2025.12 - 2028.80] the alternative sections there i know
[2027.36 - 2029.76] because i know doctors in all those
[2028.80 - 2031.28] clinics
[2029.76 - 2032.96] and i know alternative doctors in all
[2031.28 - 2036.08] those clinics
[2032.96 - 2037.52] and so they're under rules
[2036.08 - 2038.88] rules
[2037.52 - 2041.12] you know what i mean
[2038.88 - 2042.72] and that and that's another thing too so
[2041.12 - 2044.24] what happens is people think altered
[2042.72 - 2046.56] medicine's alternative it's like yeah a
[2044.24 - 2048.32] little bit it is a little bit but it
[2046.56 - 2051.52] became one
[2048.32 - 2051.52] it's become one
[2053.44 - 2056.88] sean
[2054.16 - 2059.36] shimon says that one never made sense to
[2056.88 - 2062.64] me how can one virus turn into another
[2059.36 - 2064.96] virus how can all those smart doctors be
[2062.64 - 2067.92] buying that i'll tell you why it doesn't
[2064.96 - 2067.92] mean they're smart
[2068.80 - 2073.04] doesn't mean they're smart
[2071.44 - 2075.12] the one thing i've learned throughout
[2073.04 - 2078.40] all these years and that's coming from
[2075.12 - 2080.24] an uneducated person right here okay
[2078.40 - 2082.24] the only reason why these books are
[2080.24 - 2084.16] written is because spirit of compassion
[2082.24 - 2086.08] gives me every word if spirit of
[2084.16 - 2088.16] compassion didn't give me every word you
[2086.08 - 2092.24] wouldn't see a medical medium book i'm
[2088.16 - 2092.24] not a highly educated person
[2092.32 - 2096.48] but i'm street smart
[2094.56 - 2098.72] i'm street smart
[2096.48 - 2100.20] you can be the smartest
[2098.72 - 2102.40] person
[2100.20 - 2104.88] academic-wise go through medical school
[2102.40 - 2108.00] and be the most dumbest ass the dumbest
[2104.88 - 2110.40] ass you ever met out there
[2108.00 - 2112.96] and that's one of the reasons
[2110.40 - 2115.36] so when you go you lose your common
[2112.96 - 2117.52] sense there's no common sense left so
[2115.36 - 2118.88] you can be this brilliant physician and
[2117.52 - 2121.76] still think
[2118.88 - 2125.52] shingles is the chickenpox virus when
[2121.76 - 2125.52] they're two separate viruses
[2127.52 - 2131.52] the only reason why medical medium
[2129.52 - 2133.04] information has saved the lives more
[2131.52 - 2135.84] lives with chronic illness around the
[2133.04 - 2138.24] world than any other any other
[2135.84 - 2139.52] any other modality any other belief
[2138.24 - 2141.68] system out there because the medical
[2139.52 - 2146.24] medium is in a belief system
[2141.68 - 2148.00] it doesn't it doesn't segregate
[2146.24 - 2149.68] like it doesn't segregate and say oh you
[2148.00 - 2152.40] can't do medical medium eating animal
[2149.68 - 2154.32] protein no this is just veganism or
[2152.40 - 2156.96] we're we're animal protein you can't be
[2154.32 - 2160.64] a vegan medical medium information is
[2156.96 - 2162.80] not occult but the colts out there
[2160.64 - 2165.68] they're they're they're locked in
[2162.80 - 2168.00] they're locked in those colts you gotta
[2165.68 - 2170.48] buy into those colts and you get locked
[2168.00 - 2172.80] into those colts right those are the
[2170.48 - 2176.48] colts that's why you don't heal you
[2172.80 - 2178.88] don't heal in colts you can't heal in
[2176.48 - 2180.64] any of those colds because when you even
[2178.88 - 2182.32] if you are healing a little you get
[2180.64 - 2185.44] screwed up and go backwards and go down
[2182.32 - 2188.00] the drain you can't heal in a cult
[2185.44 - 2189.60] medical medium information worldwide has
[2188.00 - 2192.56] healed more people in chronic illness
[2189.60 - 2196.24] than history history today no one can
[2192.56 - 2198.72] match it because it's free from cults
[2196.24 - 2201.84] and it's free
[2198.72 - 2201.84] and it's free
[2201.92 - 2205.92] and the cause of chronic illness that
[2204.00 - 2208.24] that medical media put out there such as
[2205.92 - 2210.24] epstein-barr and the reactivated
[2208.24 - 2211.92] epstein-barr all that information that
[2210.24 - 2213.52] got out there and how shingles works and
[2211.92 - 2215.28] the cause of it how there's over 30
[2213.52 - 2218.00] varieties of shingles and all these
[2215.28 - 2221.04] things all this information these broken
[2218.00 - 2225.04] barriers turn people's lives around you
[2221.04 - 2225.04] guys we're doing the anti-bug cleanse
[2225.28 - 2229.60] it's over 60 varieties of that steam bar
[2227.44 - 2231.36] and growing
[2229.60 - 2232.88] and growing
[2231.36 - 2235.52] you're somebody here's how it works
[2232.88 - 2236.64] somebody with an epstein-barr
[2235.52 - 2240.48] right
[2236.64 - 2243.52] and then you pick up another epstein bar
[2240.48 - 2246.64] two epstein bars inside the body
[2243.52 - 2248.80] can create a new epstein bar that new
[2246.64 - 2249.76] epstein bar then you pass to someone
[2248.80 - 2251.68] else
[2249.76 - 2253.52] that new epstein bar is different than
[2251.68 - 2256.72] the other epstein bars
[2253.52 - 2259.20] that's how it can happen too
[2256.72 - 2261.12] so i just made some celery juice
[2259.20 - 2263.28] one of the greatest tools
[2261.12 - 2266.00] of all time happening right there big
[2263.28 - 2269.36] part of people healing i'm cooking
[2266.00 - 2270.88] portobello stew i'm really digging it
[2269.36 - 2273.04] they didn't know they didn't even know
[2270.88 - 2274.80] epstein barker reactivate they thought
[2273.04 - 2277.04] you had mono and it disappeared forever
[2274.80 - 2279.28] that's it they didn't know epstein barr
[2277.04 - 2280.64] caused the neurological symptom
[2279.28 - 2282.16] they didn't know epstein-barr caused
[2280.64 - 2284.40] hashimoto's thyroiditis multiple
[2282.16 - 2286.00] sclerosis lupus fibromyalgia
[2284.40 - 2287.68] chronic fatigue syndrome me chronic
[2286.00 - 2289.44] fatigue syndrome they didn't know they
[2287.68 - 2291.04] didn't know it caused tinnitus ringing
[2289.44 - 2293.04] in the air vertigo they didn't know yeah
[2291.04 - 2294.64] this is an interesting one and i thought
[2293.04 - 2296.40] look i saw someone make a comment of
[2294.64 - 2298.72] this about this and it's so true right
[2296.40 - 2300.64] in the medical medium feed
[2298.72 - 2303.20] is
[2300.64 - 2305.60] now i have an answer
[2303.20 - 2308.32] for why i have vertigo
[2305.60 - 2310.80] they told me it was crystals
[2308.32 - 2314.32] in the ear
[2310.80 - 2317.84] crystals in the air right in the ear
[2314.32 - 2321.76] crystals in your ears right
[2317.84 - 2325.76] but the person was 20 years old
[2321.76 - 2328.64] you can't get crystals in the ear at 20.
[2325.76 - 2332.80] you get them when you're in your 50s
[2328.64 - 2335.60] 60s up and 70s
[2332.80 - 2338.72] and that doesn't cause
[2335.60 - 2340.56] vertigo crystals in the ear do not cause
[2338.72 - 2343.84] vertigo vertigo is caused by
[2340.56 - 2345.84] epstein-barr inflaming the vagus nerve
[2343.84 - 2347.68] and here you've got a 20 year old that's
[2345.84 - 2350.00] waking up to it through medical medium
[2347.68 - 2352.84] information and waking up to it saying
[2350.00 - 2356.40] wait a minute i'm 20 years old
[2352.84 - 2359.20] i crystals in the air don't even exist
[2356.40 - 2360.88] in a 20 year old
[2359.20 - 2362.48] by the way long haul covet that's
[2360.88 - 2364.48] medical medium information as far as
[2362.48 - 2366.56] epstein-barr reactivating and being
[2364.48 - 2368.24] long-haul covet because kova knocks down
[2366.56 - 2370.16] the immune system then the obscene bar
[2368.24 - 2372.56] reactivates that's published first by
[2370.16 - 2374.16] medical medium it's medical medium info
[2372.56 - 2376.16] you're hearing it out there from podcast
[2374.16 - 2377.76] doctors they're spineless they stole it
[2376.16 - 2379.28] they took it they poached it they're
[2377.76 - 2380.56] using it they're pretending it didn't
[2379.28 - 2382.24] come from here when it was published
[2380.56 - 2384.32] here first she goes to show you
[2382.24 - 2387.12] integrity
[2384.32 - 2389.28] there's a war on in podcast land
[2387.12 - 2390.96] the doctors and podcasts are trying
[2389.28 - 2393.44] everything they can
[2390.96 - 2396.16] to get paid millions of dollars by
[2393.44 - 2399.20] advertisers spending millions of dollars
[2396.16 - 2401.44] in ads and wanting to be um wanting to
[2399.20 - 2403.20] be famous in their podcast it has
[2401.44 - 2404.80] nothing to do with people getting better
[2403.20 - 2406.64] they act like it is but it's not has
[2404.80 - 2408.84] nothing to do with that
[2406.64 - 2410.88] elena says i used to work in
[2408.84 - 2413.92] neurological clinic
[2410.88 - 2415.84] the amount of bs that they tell patients

[2624.64 - 2628.16] that was that was the main reason
[2626.24 - 2630.00] because there was something
[2628.16 - 2631.92] interesting about medical media books
[2630.00 - 2634.40] and what it was was unique information
[2631.92 - 2635.84] never before seen in holistic medicine
[2634.40 - 2638.40] or conventional medicine unique

[2665.76 - 2670.88] private audio messages
[2668.40 - 2672.56] private audio messages i talked about on
[2670.88 - 2674.08] telegram on the private audio message
[2672.56 - 2676.32] today i'm talking about the egg shortage
[2674.08 - 2678.40] that's happening right now it's going to
[2676.32 - 2680.48] get pretty crazy the egg shortage is
[2678.40 - 2682.48] getting crazier and crazier and the egg
[2680.48 - 2684.40] shortage
[2682.48 - 2686.24] is happening out there right big
[2684.40 - 2688.48] shortage
[2686.24 - 2691.28] and
[2688.48 - 2693.76] this doesn't mean go buy a chicken it
[2691.28 - 2695.60] doesn't mean go buy a whole bunch of
[2693.76 - 2698.40] chickens and start a chicken coop that's
[2695.60 - 2701.28] not what it means this is your chance to
[2698.40 - 2704.24] break away from eggs because eggs feed
[2701.28 - 2708.16] the bugs that keep you sick so here's a
[2704.24 - 2709.52] chance you can actually break away
[2708.16 - 2711.28] because there's going to be an egg
[2709.52 - 2713.12] shortage
[2711.28 - 2715.28] there already is
[2713.12 - 2718.92] right
[2715.28 - 2718.92] there's an egg shortage
[2720.08 - 2723.44] so if you stay away from eggs dairy
[2721.60 - 2726.72] products milk cheese butter gluten soft
[2723.44 - 2728.72] drinks boom level one out the door
[2726.72 - 2731.60] level one out the door
[2728.72 - 2734.88] if you want to take it to level two
[2731.60 - 2737.04] get rid of pork it's a little piggy here
[2734.88 - 2740.80] got a little piggy
[2737.04 - 2743.04] get rid of pork get rid of tuna
[2740.80 - 2743.04] right
[2743.60 - 2747.84] people think
[2744.96 - 2748.88] like sushi is healthy but all i see with
[2747.84 - 2751.76] sushi
[2748.88 - 2751.76] is that right there
[2751.84 - 2755.44] that's all i see with sushi
[2754.00 - 2758.32] okay
[2755.44 - 2761.12] but this but with vinegar
[2758.32 - 2763.04] so mercury with vinegar so i'm not just
[2761.12 - 2764.80] going to have mercury i'm going to have
[2763.04 - 2767.60] mercury and vinegar
[2764.80 - 2767.60] so healthy
[2767.76 - 2771.68] anybody coming on here vinegar is not
[2769.44 - 2772.84] healthy at all it's something you don't
[2771.68 - 2776.88] want to
[2772.84 - 2779.04] do so stew is definitely a stew
[2776.88 - 2780.64] there's no question so what i'm doing is
[2779.04 - 2783.84] turning down the heat
[2780.64 - 2783.84] that baby looks good
[2784.08 - 2788.88] okay
[2785.92 - 2790.64] pork is a blood thickener so here's the
[2788.88 - 2793.44] rules
[2790.64 - 2795.92] the anti-bug cleanse is really awesome
[2793.44 - 2799.20] you get away from bug fuel
[2795.92 - 2800.40] you get away from blood thickeners
[2799.20 - 2801.96] right
[2800.40 - 2804.80] you get away from
[2801.96 - 2809.04] dehydrators of the body and you get away
[2804.80 - 2809.04] from toxin contributors
[2809.36 - 2814.08] so we're on day two what level did you
[2812.00 - 2816.40] pick right
[2814.08 - 2818.40] and what i love about taking out pork is
[2816.40 - 2820.56] you you open up the doors for more
[2818.40 - 2824.56] oxygen inside your blood because pork
[2820.56 - 2827.44] swallows up the oxygen and takes it away
[2824.56 - 2827.44] level three
[2827.68 - 2831.92] soy and lamb
[2829.20 - 2834.72] industrial oils palm oil canola oil corn
[2831.92 - 2838.00] oil safflower oil soybean oil
[2834.72 - 2839.84] fish all fish except for salmon trout
[2838.00 - 2842.32] and sardines
[2839.84 - 2845.12] it's level three level four everything i
[2842.32 - 2847.20] just said
[2845.12 - 2848.88] plus vinegar including apple cider
[2847.20 - 2851.20] vinegar fermented foods including
[2848.88 - 2852.48] kombucha tea coconut amino acids
[2851.20 - 2855.04] including that
[2852.48 - 2857.52] caffeine including coffee matcha
[2855.04 - 2859.52] chocolate
[2857.52 - 2861.28] that's level four can we go to level
[2859.52 - 2862.08] five
[2861.28 - 2864.16] right
[2862.08 - 2866.88] all the above
[2864.16 - 2868.08] plus all grains except for millet and
[2866.88 - 2871.28] oats
[2868.08 - 2873.52] and then we get all oils out olive oil
[2871.28 - 2876.16] all the healthy oils olive oil walnut
[2873.52 - 2878.72] oil sesame oil avocado oil we get rid of
[2876.16 - 2880.96] all the oils
[2878.72 - 2882.72] okay i love how the vegan doctors think
[2880.96 - 2885.20] that like
[2882.72 - 2888.40] sunflower oil sunflower seeds is like
[2885.20 - 2889.68] the reason why the whole world's sick
[2888.40 - 2892.24] the whole world's sick because of
[2889.68 - 2893.12] sunflower oil and sunflower seeds
[2892.24 - 2894.80] really
[2893.12 - 2896.48] i'm scratching my head on that one
[2894.80 - 2899.28] because i got friends that never ate a
[2896.48 - 2902.48] sunflower seed in their life
[2899.28 - 2902.48] and they're so sick
[2902.88 - 2907.04] a lot of the vegan doctors come out with
[2904.32 - 2909.28] a new thing every other minute
[2907.04 - 2910.24] food science dictates that it's not a
[2909.28 - 2912.64] mega
[2910.24 - 2915.76] it's not omega-6s that are good for you
[2912.64 - 2917.28] now it's omega-3s it's a we're all sick
[2915.76 - 2921.60] the whole world is sick because of
[2917.28 - 2923.44] omega-6 it's because of sunflower seeds
[2921.60 - 2925.28] so you're sick in bed right now on
[2923.44 - 2928.24] mattress island with your lupus because
[2925.28 - 2930.80] of sunflower seeds do you understand how
[2928.24 - 2932.88] ironically stupid the whole thing is how
[2930.80 - 2934.56] every time the vegan doctors even speak
[2932.88 - 2935.84] it's almost embarrassing like i can't
[2934.56 - 2938.00] handle it
[2935.84 - 2940.72] every time the vegan doctors speak out
[2938.00 - 2942.80] there it's like holy are you sitti
[2940.72 - 2943.68] oh my god here we go again what is he
[2942.80 - 2948.16] saying
[2943.68 - 2948.16] what is he saying what is dr saying
[2948.32 - 2952.40] michelle l haha every other minute
[2950.24 - 2954.24] something else exactly
[2952.40 - 2956.32] the reason why the whole world is sick
[2954.24 - 2959.12] is because of potatoes
[2956.32 - 2962.48] because i'm scratching my head on that
[2959.12 - 2965.20] francisca my doctors says my anemia is
[2962.48 - 2968.20] due to veganism frustrating
[2965.20 - 2968.20] unbelievable
[2971.20 - 2974.56] so now the vegan doctors believe the
[2972.88 - 2977.36] whole world is sick
[2974.56 - 2979.60] because of sunflower seeds
[2977.36 - 2982.48] how many sunflower seeds have you eaten
[2979.60 - 2985.76] in your lifetime
[2982.48 - 2988.80] so your your multiple sclerosis ms right
[2985.76 - 2990.96] ms your lupus your fibromyalgia your rna
[2988.80 - 2993.84] your hashimoto's thyroiditis your eczema
[2990.96 - 2995.92] psoriasis from sunflower seeds says the
[2993.84 - 2998.08] the vegan doctors
[2995.92 - 3000.72] my god but no they'll just come out with
[2998.08 - 3002.72] another stupid book
[3000.72 - 3004.48] and another
[3002.72 - 3006.40] and they'll put a million dollars behind
[3004.48 - 3008.24] it with the pr company
[3006.40 - 3009.76] and they'll sell crap
[3008.24 - 3012.16] and they'll send everybody down the
[3009.76 - 3014.48] wrong direction and no one stops it
[3012.16 - 3017.28] because you can't it's a train that
[3014.48 - 3017.28] takes you to hell
[3019.52 - 3023.84] and i love this a doctor is going to
[3021.36 - 3027.60] tell you so your doctor says my anemia
[3023.84 - 3029.04] is due to veganism when literally
[3027.60 - 3031.60] there are
[3029.04 - 3034.48] millions tens of millions of people that
[3031.60 - 3036.48] eat animal protein that are anemic
[3034.48 - 3038.72] so i'm scratching my head on that
[3036.48 - 3041.04] there's tens of millions of people women
[3038.72 - 3042.64] that are anemic that eat animal protein
[3041.04 - 3044.64] but for some reason you're you're you're
[3042.64 - 3046.16] anemias because of
[3044.64 - 3047.76] does that doctor have any idea it's
[3046.16 - 3049.52] epstein-barr course night is there no
[3047.76 - 3051.44] medical medium information and that
[3049.52 - 3053.92] epstein bar creates anemia because it
[3051.44 - 3057.28] eats iron there's a lot of varieties of
[3053.92 - 3057.28] ebv that eat iron
[3057.44 - 3060.80] all right so we're level five plus bonus

[3141.52 - 3146.08] it's got fake b12 in it
[3144.24 - 3148.08] okay that they add to it

[3148.08 - 3152.64] nutritional yeast did you guys know why
[3150.16 - 3156.08] it's the same way they add
[3152.64 - 3157.84] uh they fortify white bread
[3156.08 - 3159.44] they enrich
[3157.84 - 3161.20] white bread
[3159.44 - 3162.56] and white rice
[3161.20 - 3164.32] right

[3177.44 - 3181.36] and then they get you addicted to that
[3179.44 - 3183.52] glutamic acid
[3181.36 - 3185.36] and then you stay sick and you never
