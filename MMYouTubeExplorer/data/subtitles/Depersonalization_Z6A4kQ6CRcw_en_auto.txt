[0.54 - 5.60] reading about depersonalization in the
[3.36 - 8.28] new brain saver books check this out
[5.60 - 10.32] comprehensive detailed information no
[8.28 - 12.36] one wants to be depersonalized being
[10.32 - 14.22] numbed out is not something someone
[12.36 - 16.38] wants to portray to others or feel
[14.22 - 18.48] inside I mean we don't want to feel numb
[16.38 - 21.48] inside we want to be able to feel things
[18.48 - 23.52] people with depersonalization often
[21.48 - 25.74] don't feel as though they've experienced
[23.52 - 27.18] what they've just experienced did you
[25.74 - 28.74] ever know someone that's gone through
[27.18 - 32.40] that have you ever felt that your
[28.74 - 35.16] self-wear you had an experience but did
[32.40 - 37.26] you feel that experience like it was a
[35.16 - 40.38] good experience but you're just too numb
[37.26 - 42.48] to feel that experience maybe you were
[40.38 - 44.40] with a group of people and everybody had
[42.48 - 47.04] a good time but you were felt like you
[44.40 - 49.26] were dying inside like you just felt
[47.04 - 51.54] like you couldn't connect and you
[49.26 - 53.52] couldn't even focus or feel as if you
[51.54 - 56.04] were part of it all
[53.52 - 58.26] it's almost like a numbness or inability
[56.04 - 60.72] to connect others
[58.26 - 63.42] to yourself too so it's like you're so
[60.72 - 65.82] numb you're so disconnected you can't
[63.42 - 67.68] even feel like you can make
[65.82 - 71.04] communication happen with somebody else
[67.68 - 72.54] an interaction that feels healthy and
[71.04 - 74.10] then you're doubting yourself every
[72.54 - 76.62] minute and I've seen this with with
[74.10 - 78.00] depersonalization so many people doubt
[76.62 - 79.62] themselves they don't believe in
[78.00 - 83.16] themselves anymore they feel like
[79.62 - 85.44] they've lost that confidence and when
[83.16 - 87.84] you live with depersonalization all the
[85.44 - 89.58] confidence disappears and then you feel
[87.84 - 92.82] like you're not confident about anything
[89.58 - 95.22] even decisions you're making and it's
[92.82 - 97.08] even hard to even make decisions with
[95.22 - 99.72] depersonalization
[97.08 - 102.24] and that's hard too they could be
[99.72 - 104.70] standing next to a friend with whom they
[102.24 - 107.22] just took a hike with to watch a
[104.70 - 109.80] beautiful sunset and they could feel a
[107.22 - 112.26] disconnect from it all he can literally
[109.80 - 115.14] be doing something that's really
[112.26 - 117.42] exciting or fun or something that feels
[115.14 - 120.60] so good like you watch a sunset but you
[117.42 - 123.72] feel so disconnected in your mind and in
[120.60 - 125.76] your head and in your being that you
[123.72 - 127.68] don't even enjoy it and that other
[125.76 - 129.18] person that's with you they're enjoying
[127.68 - 132.00] it and they're like
[129.18 - 135.30] incredible Sunset and look and you feel
[132.00 - 138.12] like I I can't feel it and that happens
[135.30 - 140.64] to so many people it makes it so hard
[138.12 - 143.28] it can be experienced as a disconnect
[140.64 - 145.80] from oneself a spiritual disconnect too
[143.28 - 147.36] and then with with the personalization
[145.80 - 149.64] you feel like you're not spiritually
[147.36 - 151.56] connected and you can't make that
[149.64 - 154.20] spiritual connection and you see others
[151.56 - 156.36] doing it see other people in yoga class
[154.20 - 158.04] and they're just like seem like they're
[156.36 - 160.98] like really spiritually connecting and
[158.04 - 163.20] they're like well am I connecting too
[160.98 - 166.86] they're seeing life from a perspective
[163.20 - 167.82] as if they themselves weren't there and
[166.86 - 171.48] that's another thing with
[167.82 - 173.16] depersonalization it feels like you're a
[171.48 - 177.00] different perspective like you're not
[173.16 - 178.56] even there it's like you don't exist and
[177.00 - 180.96] that's something that happens too you
[178.56 - 183.24] guys I'm reading depersonalization in
[180.96 - 185.88] the brain saver books really detailed
[183.24 - 189.06] comprehensive information here
[185.88 - 191.64] if you've experienced depersonalization
[189.06 - 192.66] you may have been told you need to find
[191.64 - 195.06] yourself
[192.66 - 196.56] I think it's really insulting
[195.06 - 198.84] when someone's actually really
[196.56 - 202.38] struggling with depersonalization I
[198.84 - 204.72] think it's insulting to tell them
[202.38 - 207.12] you need to find yourself that's what it
[204.72 - 209.70] really is like just go find yourself
[207.12 - 212.34] it's more than that it's more than that
[209.70 - 214.32] one person's depersonalization could be
[212.34 - 217.04] much different from someone else's and
[214.32 - 219.54] that's a whole nother topic there
[217.04 - 222.18] everybody's depersonalization could be
[219.54 - 225.48] different and is different
[222.18 - 228.60] it's a large gray area bordering the
[225.48 - 230.34] threshold of depression and anxiety how
[228.60 - 232.50] many people do you guys maybe know in
[230.34 - 234.66] your life that had depersonalization or
[232.50 - 236.90] suffering with it now that also have
[234.66 - 241.62] like the anxiety and the depression
[236.90 - 241.62] along with this depersonalization
[241.76 - 246.72] the classic variety of depersonalization
[244.44 - 249.84] is the inability to feel emotionally
[246.72 - 252.84] that's the classic variety
[249.84 - 255.30] you're completely numb nothing excites
[252.84 - 258.06] you nothing gets you upset nothing
[255.30 - 260.28] matters nothing interests you
[258.06 - 263.16] and you feel like you're not inside your
[260.28 - 264.90] body and you don't exist a lot of people
[263.16 - 267.18] feel this way this is the classic
[264.90 - 268.08] depersonalization so many people have
[267.18 - 270.62] this
[268.08 - 273.78] even within this classic variety of
[270.62 - 275.96] depersonalization there can be plenty of
[273.78 - 277.86] variables what I'm saying is there's no
[275.96 - 279.30] one-size-fits all for all these symptoms
[277.86 - 281.10] and conditions
[279.30 - 282.84] just like in depersonalization there's
[281.10 - 285.18] no one size fits all like your
[282.84 - 287.64] depersonalization is exactly like yours
[285.18 - 289.56] and you're the person like no they're
[287.64 - 292.08] all different there's variables even
[289.56 - 294.18] with the classic of like I feel numb and
[292.08 - 295.92] I don't feel like I exist
[294.18 - 297.60] it's still different than someone else
[295.92 - 299.40] who feels numb and feels like they don't
[297.60 - 302.16] exist
[299.40 - 304.14] the reason for so much variability in
[302.16 - 307.02] the experience of depersonalization is
[304.14 - 310.74] the range of causes There's real causes
[307.02 - 313.92] you guys detailed information become an
[310.74 - 316.74] expert because you can you can become an
[313.92 - 318.60] expert you can read the details you can
[316.74 - 320.34] learn that depersonalization is a
[318.60 - 323.54] physical problem
[320.34 - 326.46] physical there's things to actually fix
[323.54 - 329.64] and that's what's important to know
[326.46 - 330.84] so these causes range from emotional
[329.64 - 333.84] injury
[330.84 - 336.54] which can create a physical injury
[333.84 - 339.06] inside our brain emotional injury to
[336.54 - 341.94] toxic heavy metals to adrenal burnout
[339.06 - 343.44] when we get our adrenals in such a
[341.94 - 345.90] problem because we're up against so much
[343.44 - 348.06] stress emotional abuse problems betrayal
[345.90 - 350.10] broken trust and our adrenals are just
[348.06 - 352.26] stepping it up and we're shaking
[350.10 - 353.88] sometimes you know where you feel like
[352.26 - 356.46] someone just got you so upset they
[353.88 - 358.62] triggered you so bad someone triggered
[356.46 - 360.60] you so bad you're actually shaking and
[358.62 - 362.70] you feel it like you're shaking you just
[360.60 - 364.86] want to run and scream
[362.70 - 367.68] so these causes can range from all these
[364.86 - 370.14] things I'm talking about each cause can
[367.68 - 371.76] vary too for example when it comes to
[370.14 - 373.56] toxic heavy metals there are differences
[371.76 - 375.78] from person to person and what type of
[373.56 - 377.34] metal or metals are in the brain you can
[375.78 - 378.84] have a different form of toxic heavy
[377.34 - 381.06] metal in the brain creating a different
[378.84 - 383.22] variety of depersonalization
[381.06 - 385.38] so you can have some different Metals
[383.22 - 388.98] sprinkled about your brain that are
[385.38 - 391.50] actually creating your own subset your
[388.98 - 395.40] own unique variety of depersonalization
[391.50 - 398.16] inside your body inside your brain
[395.40 - 400.38] the metals reside inside the brain how
[398.16 - 401.58] close they are to the emotional centers
[400.38 - 403.02] of the brain here's something people
[401.58 - 404.40] don't know about like all the medical
[403.02 - 406.86] medium information has always been
[404.40 - 409.08] unique okay it's always been published
[406.86 - 411.36] first it's always unique
[409.08 - 413.70] original and here's how it works with
[411.36 - 416.16] depersonalization
[413.70 - 418.32] emotional centers of the brain toxic
[416.16 - 420.78] heavy metals that reside closer to the
[418.32 - 423.06] emotional centers of the brain
[420.78 - 426.06] can create the depersonalization so
[423.06 - 428.16] someone may have more metal or a
[426.06 - 429.66] different variety of metal closer to a
[428.16 - 431.28] certain area of the emotional centers of
[429.66 - 434.58] the brain when someone else
[431.28 - 436.80] has another type of metal somewhere on
[434.58 - 438.60] the back end of the emotional centers of
[436.80 - 441.60] the brain in a different section of the
[438.60 - 446.16] emotional centers of the brain
[441.60 - 448.56] and these Details Matter and it matters
[446.16 - 450.06] if you're healing if you want to heal if
[448.56 - 453.42] you need the information to heal
[450.06 - 455.64] becoming an expert having the details
[453.42 - 458.70] the empowerment when you know what's
[455.64 - 460.92] wrong and how to heal is just it's an
[458.70 - 462.60] incredible experience all on its own and
[460.92 - 464.10] here's the thing if you can't experience
[462.60 - 466.14] because you're suffering and struggling
[464.10 - 467.76] with depersonalization and you apply the
[466.14 - 471.66] information
[467.76 - 474.42] and you and you learn the details
[471.66 - 476.94] and that depersonalization starts to
[474.42 - 479.94] heal that's an experience right there
[476.94 - 482.34] that's when the numbness lifts up
[479.94 - 484.44] and the interpersonalization starts to
[482.34 - 486.90] lift up like a cloud and all of a sudden
[484.44 - 488.52] you start to experience your own healing
[486.90 - 490.86] process
[488.52 - 492.90] while you like everything's being fixed
[490.86 - 494.58] with depersonalization and many people
[492.90 - 496.86] have healthy personalization with
[494.58 - 498.48] medical medium information it's one of
[496.86 - 501.30] the symptoms and conditions so many
[498.48 - 502.98] people have but this is so detailed so
[501.30 - 505.68] comprehensive
[502.98 - 508.08] it's really worth looking at is brain
[505.68 - 510.12] fog present do you have brain fog with
[508.08 - 514.08] your depersonalization
[510.12 - 516.48] or is brain fog not present makes a
[514.08 - 518.52] difference that's another variable
[516.48 - 520.08] and that's what it's about medical
[518.52 - 522.24] medium books
[520.08 - 525.24] you look at the brain saver books it's
[522.24 - 527.16] not one size fits all it's the opposite
[525.24 - 529.80] it's knowing that all these different
[527.16 - 533.30] variables can happen to someone and
[529.80 - 533.30] happen inside their brain and body
[533.88 - 538.92] a low-grade viral infection such as
[535.92 - 540.66] Epstein-Barr which everybody has
[538.92 - 542.58] we've got to remember everybody's got
[540.66 - 545.46] the ebv's in their livers they got the
[542.58 - 547.14] ebvs in their body they got the ebvs in
[545.46 - 549.18] their system
[547.14 - 551.88] a low-grade viral infection such as
[549.18 - 553.86] Epstein-Barr can worsen brain fog adding
[551.88 - 556.26] to the depersonalization so you can have
[553.86 - 558.60] a low-grade viral infection
[556.26 - 559.98] causing a symptom like brain fog and a
[558.60 - 562.20] mild fatigue
[559.98 - 564.78] coupled with
[562.20 - 566.94] a variety of toxic heavy metals sitting
[564.78 - 567.78] closer to the emotional centers of the
[566.94 - 569.46] brain
[567.78 - 571.56] and that's where the confusion lies
[569.46 - 574.08] that's why it's critical to know the
[571.56 - 576.90] information so you don't get tricked our
[574.08 - 580.08] fooled or do so you don't get owned by
[576.90 - 581.76] the system you you get free because you
[580.08 - 583.14] become the expert and you say oh my God
[581.76 - 585.48] how come research and science doesn't
[583.14 - 587.88] know this does it know that you can have
[585.48 - 590.82] multiple things happening low-grade
[587.88 - 593.04] viral infection from EBV plus toxic
[590.82 - 594.54] heavy metals by the emotional centers of
[593.04 - 597.56] the brain and the different variables
[594.54 - 597.56] all included
[597.62 - 601.86] depersonalization can also happen
[599.58 - 604.74] without emotional injury without
[601.86 - 607.02] emotional trauma you can go through life
[604.74 - 609.42] everything's good you're taken care of
[607.02 - 611.58] you have support life is great
[609.42 - 613.50] and still get depersonalization I talk
[611.58 - 615.06] about that in here so it could be
[613.50 - 617.28] someone without these other variables
[615.06 - 621.20] and still get the condition learn about
[617.28 - 621.20] it here I'll see you guys next time
