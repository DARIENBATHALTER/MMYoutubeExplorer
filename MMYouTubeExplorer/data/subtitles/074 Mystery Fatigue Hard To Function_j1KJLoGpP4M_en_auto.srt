late

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,879

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
Millions mystery fatigue was born around

55
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,720
the late

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,840
1940s before that no one was really

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,599
tired unless they had a really hard work

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,640
day working the factories and still they

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,080
weren't tired tired like people are

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,680
where they get the fatigue the disease

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,159
it wasn't born yet it was just at its

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,599
beginning and today mystery for fatigue

63
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:08,080
is now not a baby it's a toddler

64
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,480
tomorrow mystery fatigue a teenager and

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,400
the future not too far from now mystery

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,120
fatigue is going to be in its Elder

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,560
phase and that's going to be horrible

68
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
there used to be a lot of people getting

69
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,319
mystery fatigue lots and lots of people

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,360
but now it's a lot of people it is

71
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,040
rampant it's an

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,040
epidemic I wish mystery fatigue was just

73
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,400
from processed foods wouldn't that be

74
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,480
amazing you're eating a bunch of junk

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,439
and garbage and fried greasy foods and

76
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,439
fast foods and processed foods your

77
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,239
whole diet is based on that and then you

78
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:48,680
just get rid of it and your fatigue is

79
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,560
fixed that would be incredible but

80
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,879
there's a lot of people out there that

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
got rid of their processed foods and

82
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,280
they're

83
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,079
bedridden but mystery fatigues not

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,040
processed foods I wish it was over

85
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,519
exercising that would be amazing kick

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,760
back don't exercise for a little bit and

87
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,959
it all goes away that would be wonderful

88
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,359
but it's not it's not from overe

89
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,160
exercising I wish mystery fatigue was

90
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:23,400
just from working too hard take a break

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,120
take a weekend off you're back to normal

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,800
you're not couch bound you're not bed

93
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,360
bound you're just back to normal but

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,960
it's not that I I wish mystery fatigue

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,639
was partying too much you party hardy

96
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,360
you're a big time partyer you're up at

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,080
night late night partying doing drugs

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,280
drinking whatever you're doing having

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,600
sex just partying way too much and

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,680
you're fatigued because of that and then

101
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,000
when you stop all that it's fixed just

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,800
fixed you're fine you're great I wish

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,120
mystery fatigue was just from stress and

104
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,240
stress alone once the stress backs down

105
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,960
calms down you're back in Action all

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,240
gone not bedridden anymore not couch

107
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,199
bound anymore not brain fogged anymore

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,199
you're just feeling good you can think

109
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,759
you could feel good you could run you

110
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,880
can do this you could stay up all day

111
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,520
not have to nap that would be amazing if

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,639
it was just stress and then when stress

113
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,039
back down you're fixed any of these

114
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:32,080
things any of them can make somebody

115
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:35,080
sluggish and tired to a degree it can

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,759
beat somebody down I'm not saying that

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,000
if you do all those things or any of

118
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,720
those things that you won't be tired

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,280
from it but the disease of being tired

120
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,720
you won't be getting you won't have that

121
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,639
permanent ticket on mattress island or

122
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,720
couch Island some rest some recovery

123
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:59,080
time take it easy relax you start to

124
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,840
recover you start to come back from it

125
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,800
and you get back back to life and that's

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,199
what would happen unless there's a

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,680
bigger problem and you're somebody

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,960
that's just trying to get through the

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,240
day you're just trying to do good things

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,199

best you can be at whatever you're doing

133
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,560
but you can't function or you can barely

134
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,560
function decades gone by medical medium

135
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,120
information is saturated the Health

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,919
Arena with information about why people

137
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,680
have chronic fatigue syndrome why people

138
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,759
have mystery fatigue and still till this

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,360
day you can go to a doctor's office both

140
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,000
alternative and conventional and it's

141
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:45,400
very possible you'll get this for an

142
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,199
answer it's all in your head diagnosis

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,919
that's right it's all in your head

144
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,919
diagnosis one big mistake in the health

145
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,840
world right now is blaming everything in

146
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:01,000
anything unprocessed foods that means as

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,280
of today right now if someone gets sick

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,720
the first part of that sickness is going

149
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,319
to be blamed on processed

150
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,840
foods and then every aspect of that

151
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,680
sickness is going to be blamed

152
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,120
unprocessed Foods it's not that

153
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,000
processed foods are good for us and it

154
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,680
also depends on what kind of processed

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,479
foods are we talking about and how

156
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,199
processed are they but either way

157
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,599
processed foods right now are taking the

158
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,879
Highlight the Limelight you're sick

159
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,120

160
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,360

foods and they're not tired far from it

192
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,240
they're not on this quintessential

193
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,519
perfect keto diet grass-fed beef piece

exercising and they're pro athletes

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,800
reminds me of a lot of pro athletes out

203
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,760
there in general a football players the

204
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,880
football players eat perfectly do they

205
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,880
eat a perfect keto diet clean from

206
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,680
anything are they looking at every

207
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,079
single package maybe somebody is maybe a

208
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,240
few people are in the league but is

209
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:04,440
every everybody doing that no when

210
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,040
they're out on that field are they in

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,320
agony with fatigue are they bedridden

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,440
are they in a bad situation where they

213
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,519
can't function and their legs feel like

214
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:20,519
sandbags and they can't walk good and

215
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,360
they're tired no they're not sure a bad

216
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,519
diet filled with all kinds of junk and

217
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,440
crap over time will probably give

218
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,440
somebody a heart attack yes somebody can

219
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
live on a junk food diet they can live

220
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,320
on fried greasy Foods processed foods

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
for many many years and not be tired at

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,839
all but yeah they can get a heart attack

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,760
they can get a blood clot they can get a

224
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,040
stroke they can get a major heart attack

225
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,040
that kills them definitely over time

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,519
things get clogged up their livers get

227
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,399
fatty stagnant sluggish don't function

228
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,959
well it's original medical medium

229
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,880
information if somebody's eating a poor

230
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,480
diet cuz in the past a poor diet was

231
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,600
really just based upon maybe heart

232
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,079
disease diabetes those two but liver

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,920
gets clogged up gets sluggish it gets

234
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,880
stagnant becomes problematic puts

235
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:21,240
pressure on the heart and it's time goes

236
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:24,160
by a major Art Attack but yet no fatigue

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,240
beforehand people can go decade after

238
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,160
decade after decade meanwhile a

239
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,160
19-year-old that's eating healthy

240
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,440

241
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,519

244
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:47,360
28-year-old 32y old fatigue can be

245
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,760
brutal and depending on the age even

246
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:54,399
more brutal the younger you are it's

247
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,120
terrifying somebody who sees everybody

248
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
else in the world living their life

249
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,079

friends their family friends all living

252
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,519
their life doing their thing and if

253
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
they're stricken with fatigue and

254
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,360
they're watching all of this it is just

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
terrifying so let's talk about the

256
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,440
reality of it all like what does it feel

257
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,720
like unless somebody's been in their

258
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,680
shoes and experienced it themselves

259
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,399
they'll never know I think one of the

260
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,639
hard Parts about having fatigue of some

261
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:29,199
kind mystery fatigue is that others

262
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,959
around you don't understand it if

263
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,000
they're not chronically tired there's a

264
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:37,440
lot of symptoms out there that are

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,639
difficult debilitating a lot of symptoms

266
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,800
that are mysterious even if they have a

267
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,920
label or somebody gets diagnosed with a

268
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,040
condition or a disease it's still a

269
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,120
mystery in the end and in all of those

270
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,720
conditions and symptoms so many

271
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,000
debilitating

272
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,519
varieties fatigue is one of the bad ones

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,959
because when you're dealing with a shake

274
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,839
it's a symptom where you have a Tremor

275
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,040
you might be able to show somebody the

276
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,600
Tremor if you got a twitch or a tick or

277
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,839
a spasm you might be able to show

278
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,399
somebody the

279
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,120
spasm if you have something where you

280
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,920
have a drop foot or something like that

281
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,720
somebody could see it and they'll be

282
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,120
like whoa something's going on with that

283
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,199
person and if somebody has a really bad

284
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,240
belly ache even though they can't feel

285
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,800
it and they can't feel what the person's

286
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
going through who has that belly ache it

287
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,480
still can be like okay and the person's

288
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,959
holding their belly and they're yelling

289
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,959
and they're saying this is terrible I'm

290
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,480
in a lot of pain but when it comes down

291
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,600
to fatigue it's kind of like this

292
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,279
Phantom this ghost kind of thing and

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,360
there's only so many times you could say

294
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,639
I'm tired telling family and friends and

295
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,480

300
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:59,120
eyes open or I can't even stand anymore

301
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,079
I'm feeling so fatigued well you should

302
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,880
go to a doctor then head to a doctor and

303
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,079
get it fixed I've been to three doctors

304
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,880
already they think I need a vacation but

305
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,040
I can't take a vacation right now okay

306
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
well go take a vacation take some time

307
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,399
off come back when you're all better now

308
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,000
they take some time off they come back

309
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,600
to work and they're just as tired then

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,639
the boss is like whoa were you having a

311
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,360
lot of fun out there what were you doing

312
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,560
I've been on the couch and in my bed the

313
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,480
entire week it's one of those symptoms

314
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,440
one of those conditions that people

315
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,959
don't have a lot of forgiveness for a

316
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,040
lot of compassion for so if you're

317
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,600
somebody and you're dealing with fatigue

318
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,600
of some kind now there's different

319
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,120
varieties of fatigue different levels of

320
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,560
fatigue and right now I'm just putting

321
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,680
it all in one fatigue Ball but we'll

322
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,759
cover some of the different varieties

323
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,240
but either

324
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,440
way however you look at it it's one of

325
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,519
those things where people don't have a

326
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,639
lot of respect for because they might

327
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:59,040
say this person's lazy or copping

328
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,959
out but what about other symptoms like

329
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,519
fatigue is bad enough as it is what

330
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,839
about anxiety along with the fatigue

331
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,000
where you're sitting on the couch you're

332
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,639
panicked your anxiety ridden and your

333
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,839
fatigued it's a really salt in the

334
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,480
wounds and a lot of people have more

335
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,079
than just fatigue and anxiety they'll

336
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,279
have aches and pains fatigue Tangles and

337
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,839
numbness ringing in the ears all kinds

338
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,079
of different balance problems and

339
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,800
vertigo issues pain in the jaw pain in

340
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,079
the back pain in the feet pain on top of

341
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,560
their head their scalp trigeminal

342
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:35,360
neuralgia burning tongue and burning

mouth and fatigue all of it and fatigue

344
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,680
and fatigue is bad enough so let's talk

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,560
about different levels of fatigue

346
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,199
there's being tired where you feel it in

347
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:49,040
your eyes your eyes are tired you rub

348
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,240
them a lot they feel heavy your eyelids

349
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,160
feel like they want to close on

350
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,920
themselves you stretch a lot you yawn a

351
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,319
lot you're yawning more than normal

352
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,120
people are seeing you yawn all the time

353
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,800
people who are demanding your attention

354
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,519
or looking at you and you're yawning

355
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,319
right at them you can't help it you

356
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,560
can't hold the yawn in but wait a minute

357
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,600
that's not just tired it's more than

358
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,959
that you're yawning you're stretching

359
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,040
and then you're kind of nodding off it's

360
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,880
another thing too so many people who

361
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,480
have fatigue nod off as they're talking

362
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,639
to a family member or a friend they

363
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,199
start falling asleep and their family

364
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,519
member or friend is like hey you should

365
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,000
take a nap now now and it could be

366
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,839
intermittent you got a little energy one

367
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
hour in the day another hour you're down

368
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,079
for the count another hour you're

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
feeling better another hour down for the

370
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:46,240
count and then it could be this thing

371
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,600
where you're half tired during one part

372
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,720
of the day more tired on another part of

373
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,519
the day or feeling pretty darn good one

374
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,240
part of the day and then another part of

375
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:57,880
the day you're just down it can vary in

376
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
so many different ways depending on what

377
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,920
you're doing too

378
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,360
if the fatigue is getting a little worse

379
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,280
and you exercise now you're trashed

380
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,360
trashed for a day some people they'll

381
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,559
exercise with fatigue they're fighting

382
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,559
it they're struggling they're doing

383
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,360
everything they can and now they're down

384
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,880
and out for 3 days after and then

385
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,799
somebody could have a lot of energy in

386
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,640
the morning all through the day they're

387
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:27,240
doing pretty good and then early evening

388
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,919
they're so exhausted they can only just

389
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,480
lay in bed fatigue can accompany a whole

390
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:38,240
bunch of brain fog somebody could have

391
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,200
just a foggy mind foggy head foggy brain

392
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,480
they can't get their words out right

393
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,280
they're feeling so low energy they can't

394
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,960
get their thoughts together they're

395
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,120
struggling because they're so tired so

396
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,520
getting words out is difficult all on

397
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,600
its own taking a breath is difficult too

398
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,720
and at the same time their head could be

399
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,360
really brain fogged out and these are a

400
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,760
few of the mild fatigue situations what

401
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,320
about real serious serious fatigue where

402
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,720
you feel like you got lead weights in

403
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,000
your hands you feel like you have cement

404
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,600
shoes on your feet and just walking

405
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,600
takes everything you have and then it

406
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:22,039
can go even further than that where you

407
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,520
can't take a shower the water hitting

408
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,280
you almost knocks you over it's a big

409
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,600
thing a lot of people deal with it what

410
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,640
happens when people suffer in that way

411
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,200
though they really get alienated and

412
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,200
people don't really want to hear about

413
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,039
it anymore and they end up losing

414
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,039
friends losing touch with people their

415
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,960
daytoday is suffering and they're just

416
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,400
in their house or in their apartment

417
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,000
somewhere and they're really really

418
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,440
struggling where taking a shower is so

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,559
difficult they'll get the dizzy spells

420
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,720
they'll feel the water hit them and

421
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,159
it'll kind of light up their nerves

422
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,159
they'll get different Sensations that

423
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:03,120
are really difficult they'll get a panic

424
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,200
attack their chest will become tight

425
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,280
they feel like they can't breathe the

426
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,200
fatigue will take over and after the

427
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,320
shower they're done they're back on

428
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,799
their bed and they're trying to just

429
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,880
recoup same thing with going to the

430
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,200
bathroom using the toilet just having to

431
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,600
eliminate sometimes it takes everything

432
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,720
a person has even if they don't have the

433
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,600
worst fatigue and they have just fatigue

434
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,480
all on its own going to the bathroom

435
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,039
could mean they need a break afterwards

436
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,320
where after they go after they eliminate

437
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,679
their bowels they have to go lay on the

438
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,559
bed now or lay in the couch or sit down

439
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,760
somewhere and they have to

440
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:44,120
recuperate one of the problems with

441
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,320
fatigue mystery fatigue is the industry

442
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,559
doesn't like to recognize it you have to

443
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,520
go find somebody to give you a diagnosis

444
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,120
that you have chronic fatigue syndrome

445
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,640
or me chronic fatigue syndrome and

446
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,000
that's difficult because insurance

447
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,760
companies don't care insurance iies

448
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,480
don't want to really know about this

449
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,400
kind of condition or disease so even if

450
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,360
you find coverage it might not last long

451
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,559
or something could go wrong chronic

452
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,400
fatigue syndrome is not respected enough

453
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,520
it wasn't in the past just a little bit

454
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,600
more now than it was in the past but

455
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,679
seriously as far as someone really

456
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,039
struggling with chronic fatigue syndrome

457
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,360
getting a doctor getting some kind of

458
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,400
help is still really difficult

459
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,280
understanding the condition and then

460
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,440
it's like musical chairs it's like

461
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,120
looking for something they're like well

462
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,320
you could have chronic fatigue syndrome

463
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,280
but you might have something else maybe

464
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,480
you have Lyme disease maybe you got

465
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,760
something else maybe it's Ms maybe it's

466
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,360
ra maybe it's just autoimmune maybe it's

467
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,720
all in your head and even till this day

468
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,320
someone will still get it's all in your

469
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,480
head or you're just looking for

470
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,480
attention and along with the fatigue is

471
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,520
guilt and fear and shame those are

472
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
things that really accompany it

473
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,880
especially if it's a misdiagnosis and

474
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
it's like well you're not really

475
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,799
fatigued you got this going on or you

476
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,720
got leaky gut let's fix it but it

477
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,679
doesn't get fixed you still got the

478
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,600
fatigue so more guilt and fear and shame

479
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,320
occur and then with a lot of people who

480
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,360
deal with chronic fatigue syndrome it's

481
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,679
the ultimate you look fine but you look

482
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,120
fine you can't be sick you look good you

483
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,799
look like everything's okay it's one of

484
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,400
the ultimate versions of that meanwhile

485
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:33,760
you could barely stand can barely walk

486
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,000
you can't do anything you want to do you

487
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,600
can't go and take a run and be like oo

488
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,200
and jump in a pool or in a beach you

489
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,200
can't just hop into the ocean and live

490
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,880
your life you're in a difficult

491
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,320
situation because you're getting stopped

492
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,640
everywhere you turn and that leads to

493
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,640
the whole you look great so what's

494
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,240
really wrong with you though get to the

495
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,600
doctor but the doctor can't fix you so

496
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,159
more guilt and fear and shame occurs

497
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,559
fatigue is real mystery fatigue is real

498
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:06,320
chronic fatigue syndrome is real and if

499
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,799
someone doesn't have a big brain tumor

500
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,240
inside their head that's causing fatigue

501
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:16,039
then it's Epstein bar virus and Epstein

502
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,360
bar virus could even create a brain

503
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:22,000
tumor in somebody's head so in the end

504
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,159
it originates from a virus

505
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,400
situation now there are some people that

506
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,840
will have some fatigue from the shingles

507
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,200
virus or herpes simplex one two but it's

508
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,159
different it's not necessarily the

509
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,880
fatigue that Epstein bar provides

510
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
somebody could have adrenal fatigue they

511
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
could have that and it could give them a

512
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,600
tiredness it could make them fatigued

513
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,640
but there's bounceback there's recall

514
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,880
could be at different times different

515
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,559
days but there's bounceback mystery

516
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,000
fatigue that's viral you don't really

517
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,919
get the bounce back in the way you do it

518
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,240
a dream fatigue unless the adrenals are

519
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,840
totally wasted but if they're that

520
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,440
wasted in somebody's fatigue that bad

521
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,600
because they're adrenals are that shot a

522
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,919
doctor should find that a doctor should

523
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,159
be able to diagnose it properly and know

524
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
that the adrenals are wasted that the

525
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,360
person really is suffering from adrenal

526
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,120
fatigue doesn't mean someone with

527
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,080
adrenal fatigue can't also have a viral

528
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,600
infection like Epstein bar they're

529
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,159
suffering from both and viral infections

530
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,480
can put stress on the adrenals allowing

531
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,760
adrenals to weaken more when somebody's

532
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,400
dealing with neurological fatigue the

533
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,159
next thing I'm talking about it took

534
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,159
decades for the world of medicine to

535
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,799
realize fatigue was

536
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,159
neurological decades and decades medical

537
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,039
medium information knew it was

538
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,679
neurological because it wasn't just

539
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,840
somebody being tired or exhausted or it

540
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,360
was all in their head or they were being

541
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,279
lazy there were real reasons someone was

542
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,640
suffering with fatigue

543
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:06,159
neurological fatigue by medical medium

544
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,880
definition is the central nervous system

545
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:14,480
and other nerves within the body they're

546
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,480
inflamed due to neurotoxins or viral

547
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,679
Invasion when people were diagnosed with

548
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:25,200
glandular fever or mono and they got

549
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,880
tired doctors knew it was the mono or

550
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,919
glandular fever that was exhausting the

551
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,240
person

552
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:36,760
but they didn't know how or why and then

553
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,279
if somebody recovered from mono somebody

554
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,840
recovered from glandular fever and they

555
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,440
were still tired it would be a mystery

556
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,880
to the medical system mystery to the

557
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,240
medical doctors they would not know why

558
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,559
the person's tired they're better

559
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,120
they're recovered from mononucleosis

560
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,320
they're recovered from glandular fever

561
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,640
now what's going on here there's a

562
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,279
mystery and what about the person who

563
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,840
had mononucleosis 3 years ago 5 years

564
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,520
ago and has been tired ever since what

565
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,399
about the person who had glandular fever

566
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,960
10 years ago they're still tired a

567
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,880
lifetime of chronic fatigue after

568
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,320
glandular fever after

569
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,600
mononucleosis and they had a lifetime of

570
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,880
being tired no doctor nobody in the

571
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,440
medical world nobody in any medical

572
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,600
University would say they had glandular

573
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,240
fever or o they would say your tiredness

574
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,360
is just something else we don't know

575
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,240
what it is it's a mystery but really

576
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,039
what it is it's neurological fatigue

577
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,559
caused by the same virus that gave the

578
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:46,159
glandular fever the same virus that gave

579
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:50,000
the mononucleosis the Epstein bar virus

580
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:53,840
what Epstein bar does is it releases a

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,279
neurotoxin after it's consumed a

582
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,960
favorite food a favorite food to the

583
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:02,120
Epstein virus could be gluten

584
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,840
it could be dairy products it could be

585
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,360
eggs it could be toxic heavy metals like

586
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,520
Mercury and aluminum and copper but epin

587
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:15,120
bar virus loves to eat it has to eat to

588
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,159
stay alive it has to eat to survive it

589
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,520
consumes food and then it excretes it

590
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,880
does an elimination process it

591
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,960
eliminates toxins the problem is those

592
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,640
toxins aren't friendly they're highly

593
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
problematic to the central nervous

594
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,600
system to all nerves in the body epin

595
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,000
bar releases all these neurotoxins they

596
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,279
float around sometimes they get caught

597
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,399
up in the liver and they sit in there

598
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:47,000
for a long time but either way they

599
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:50,679
cause a battery draw an energy draw

600
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,360
those neurotoxins land on nerves inflame

601
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:58,039
them irritate them and this robs and

602
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,919
steals energy the more Epstein bar virus

603
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:04,559
the the more viruses the more viral

604
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:07,279
cells the more feedings that occur the

605
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,000
more neurotoxins that are released the

606
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,559
more symptoms with the chronic fatigue

607
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,480
somebody could have just a little bit of

608
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,919
viral inflammation meaning low-grade

609
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,320
viral infection not a lot of Epstein bar

610
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,679
going on just a little bit tiny bit of

611
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,039
neurotoxins being released

612
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,440
systematically and then they feel tired

613
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,480
all the time they're struggling but then

614
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,279
somebody could have more Epstein bar

615
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,120
virus and more neurotoxins are being

616
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,799
released and maybe they have more

617
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,960
mercury in their system than somebody

618
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,880
else so the Epstein bar virus is feeding

619
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,240
off of more Mercury releasing a more

620
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,960
toxic neurotoxin when this happens and

621
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,320
it's floating around someone ends up

622
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,600
getting more symptoms than just the

623
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,320
chronic fatigue syndrome now now they're

624
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,679
getting tingles and numbness dizziness

625
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,960
ringing in the ears you're getting all

626
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,399
kinds of different blurry eyes without

627
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,480
any kind of real

628
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,760
diagnosis epine bar tends to affect

629
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:12,000
cranial nerves cranial nerves such as

630
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,440
the vagus nerves when they get inflamed

631
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,640
or irritated by

632
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,760
neurotoxins then a lot of different

633
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,000
strange mysterious weird symptoms can

634
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,640
occur like tightness in the throat

635
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,919
tightness in the chest tingles and

636
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,440
numbness in weird places pains in weird

637
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,039
places as well because the vague V

638
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,000
nerves are inflamed when the vagus

639
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,880
nerves get inflamed that's when people

640
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,240
are running to neurologist after

641
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,080
neurologist after neurologist and

642
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,760
they're getting different answers from

643
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,080
each neurologist and they find

644
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,159
themselves at a lime disease doctor lime

645
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:51,000
disease specialist then now it's all

646
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,000
lime disease it's all bacteria and we're

647
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,120
off the mark now cuz it's not a

648
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,720
bacterial problem bacteria can't cause

649
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,760
these symptoms virus

650
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,320
cause these symptoms the Epstein bar

651
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,200
virus especially and when it comes down

652
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,519
to Lyme disease doctors now are testing

653
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,120
for Epstein bar interesting cuz I

654
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,279
thought it was all

655
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,480
bacteria that's what they always say and

656
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,840
said medical medium information talks

657
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,279
about it being viral Lyme disease was

658
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,799
actually a virus or viruses epine bar

659
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,960
being one of them but now lime doctors

660
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,440
are actually saying oh back Bia bacteria

661
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,480
bacteria here's some doxic cyclin here's

662
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,399
some different you know antibiotics but

663
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,679
let's go check this epine bar thing ooh

664
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:41,880
you have Epstein bar too but yet they're

665
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,679
still like oh here's the antibiotic for

666
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,240
the bacteria but yeah you have a virus

667
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,000
as well so medical medium information

668
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,519
turned the tide on that because it's

669
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,919
really a virus causing Lyme disease and

670
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,640
they're off The Mark with the bacteria

671
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,919
so what do we do if we have a viral

672
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,799
infection causing mysterious fatigue we

673
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:08,440
kill the virus we go after it we destroy

674
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,960
it we starve it we get rid of it we push

675
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,919
it out of our body and we heal and after

676
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,640
we kill that virus or

677
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,480
viruses after we kill the Epstein bar

678
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,679
virus because somebody could have two

679
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,880
varieties of Epstein bar or three

680
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,600
varieties of epsin bar after we kill

681
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,399
them and get rid of them we restore the

682
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,000
central nervous system we heal the

683
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,799
nerves if you're somebody that had a

684
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,480
diagnosis an autoimmune diagnosis a

685
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,519
condition a symptom you're struggling

686
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:44,440
for a long time you've been through a

687
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:46,840
lot you can heal yes and you will heal

688
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,919
having the right information is critical

689
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,559
giving your body what it needs like

690
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,919
smart things not just get rid of

691
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,399
processed foods that automatically is a

692
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:00,799
no-brainer of course but it's not enough

693
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,399
when it comes down to Healing we got to

694
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,000
know what's wrong and when you learn

695
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:09,240
about these viruses and you learn what

696
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,279
they're capable of how they live in us

697
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,200
what they do you can overcome the

698
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,639
condition and the symptom and not just

699
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,440
manage it overcome it every night your

700
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:22,679
body does a little bit of healing when

701
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,360
you're giving your body what it needs

702
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,159
every single night you move forward even

703
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,639
if it doesn't feel that way because when

704
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,000
a nervous system has been overburdened

705
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,600
by all those

706
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,639
neurotoxins and heavy metals and other

707
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,840
poisons and so forth when your nervous

708
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:44,360
system has been overburdened it doesn't

709
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,039
heal in one hour it can't it could do

710
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,240
some healing in 1 hour but it can't

711
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,000
fully completely heal when somebody has

712
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,159
had a long-term low-grade viral

713
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,159
infection that's been wreaking havoc or

714
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,840
viral infections that have been wreaking

715
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,960
havoc or multiple different varieties of

716
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,840
viruses it takes time but as you're

717
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,399
killing off the bugs getting rid of them

718
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,200
breaking them down and restoring a

719
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,080
damaged immune

720
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,679
system Life Starts to

721
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,039
change and you start to heal and you

722
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,639
start moving

723
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,559
forward one of the struggles is being in

724
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,080
the darkness the darkness of not knowing

725
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:30,880
why you're sick what to do and the

726
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,360
process that's a difficult place to be

727
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,440
but when you know you're restoring your

728
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,440
nervous system and that's the goal

729
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,080
that's a big deal and when you know

730
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,320
you're restoring your immune system and

731

that's the goal it's a big deal and when

732
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,240
you know you're killing off bugs and

733
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,279
pathogens and viruses it's another big

734
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,399
deal these things bring peace while

735
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,120
you're healing I'm in medical medium

736
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,120
book one Secrets behind chronic and

737
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,559
mystery illness and how to finally heal

738
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm in the chronic fatigue syndrome

739
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,840
section the revised and expanded New

740
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,200
Edition and so what I'm going to do is

741
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,919
read some of my favorites here there's a

742
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,120
lot of different things you can do for

743
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,960
chronic fatigue syndrome let's start at

744
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:18,240
the top fresh celery juice

745
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:22,080
exactly just fresh celery juice says

746
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:27,600
here work up to 32 o daily then work up

747
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:30,960
to 64 Oz if possible a day now you can

748
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:35,360
just do 4 oz of celery juice every day 2

749
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,600
oz and you're moving the needle you can

750
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,760
just do a little bit but if you get up

751
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:45,320
to 32 oz every single day you can move

752
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,240
mountains that is someplace that you

753
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,000
could just start just right there and

754
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,919
start moving things forward now keep in

755
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,960
mind you may be somebody that has a

756
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,000
multiple batch of viruses in you

757
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,360
different strains different varieties

758
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,440
you've been sick and down for a while

759
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,760
they all came to roost they're all

760
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,000
causing problems you got 50 different

761
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,079
symptoms mostly

762
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,280
neurological you're going to need

763
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,079
probably more than celery juice so let's

764
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:19,119
take a look at some of the other things

765
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:24,040
in here cat's claw one of my favorites

766
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,720
cat's claw two dropper FS twice a day

767
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,000
cats Claw is a powerful

768
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,440
antiviral it is wonderful for chronic

769
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,960
fatigue syndrome or just mystery fatigue

770
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,040
because of the medical medium

771
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,520
information lime disease doctors are now

772
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,960
offering cat's claw pathogens don't like

773
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,520
cat's claw they don't they're allergic

774
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,520
to it but yet our body isn't what

775
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:55,000
happens when cats claw enters the body

776
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,079
pathogens go oh my God run but it takes

777
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,720
time because pathogens hide out in

778
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:02,320
different places in the body they hide

779
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:05,280
out in the liver they hide out around

780
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,520
the nervous system they hide out in the

781
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,960
spleen even around the

782
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,359
pancreas takes a little time to get cats

783
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,160
claw into the body but when you bring it

784
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:18,440
in you're already moving forward lemon

785
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,040
bomb another one of my favorites it's in

786
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:25,280
the list what I love about lemon bomb it

787
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,760
helps to soothe the nerves and nerves

788
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,760
get inflamed because of EP bar and other

789
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,000
viruses and that inflammation causes

790
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,599
those nerves to vibrate to

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,560
Rattle to have a vibration behind it

792
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,920
where people lay there and they feel it

793
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,400
nerves get so inflamed it even creates

794
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,200
where you hear your heartbeat when

795
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,760
you're laying down you hear a pulse when

796
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,160
you're laying down cuz nerves get

797
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,680
inflamed and because of that there's

798
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,040
pressure building in the body so you

799
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,560
hear your pulse you hear your heartbeat

800
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,200
and that's really hard for people who

801
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,920
can't sleep or they're laying around all

802
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,440
day long and they have to hear that that

803
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,599
inflammation is the nerve swelling

804
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,160
pressing against so many other things

805
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:19,560
lemon mom calms the nerves eases them

806
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,920
it's really an amazing herb for the

807
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,839
nervous system helps them to heal to

808
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,960
and pathogens do not like lemon bomb

809
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,440
it's antiviral

810
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,640
another one on the list I really like is

811
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,839
licorice root it's antiviral says one

812
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:42,000
drop or full twice a day viruses hate

813
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,000
licorice root especially viruses that

814
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,240
hibernate inside the liver licorice

815
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,760
fruit is a great great herb for the

816
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,520
liver helps to push out the viruses

817
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,640
helps to gum them up get them trapped

818
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:02,880
get them doile licorice root is also

819
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,800
good for the immune system helps to

820
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,319
restore the immune system strengthen it

821
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,400
something that you need especially when

822
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,680
you've dealt with fatigue for so many

823
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,640
years and for so long vitamin B12 that's

824
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,000
a big one right there meth cobalamin and

825
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,960
adinos Sil cobalamin the combination is

826
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,520
perfect for the nervous system and what

827
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,599
happens with people their nerves get

828
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,480
fried they get burnt out

829
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,560
central nervous system and nervous

830
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,880
system symptoms are some of the worst

831
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,760
and fatigue is a neurological symptom

832
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,119
it's neurological fatigue that means the

833
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,480
nerves are up against problems and like

834
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,800
we talked about before neurotoxins

835
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,200
inflaming the nerves there needs to be

836
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,920
some help for those nerves and b12 is a

837
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,720
big one right there golden seal is

838
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,680
another one on the list it's one of my

839
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,040
favorites says two dropper FS twice a

840
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,960
day

841
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,240
that's an important one great for the

842
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,160
immune system helps to move the needle

843
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,319
viruses and pathogens do not like golden

844
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,240
seal and one of the most important

845
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:14,240
that's on the list right here zinc

846
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,720
liquid zinc sulfate it says here two

847
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,760
dropper FS twice a day in the medical

848
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,520
medium book zinc is a big one because it

849
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,079
slows down and stops cyto

850
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,680
storms it gets in the way of path

851
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,000
in every way pathogens viruses

852
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:38,319
especially do not like zinc and zinc

853
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,599
restores the immune system and the thing

854
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:44,640
is people who are sick have immune

855
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,040
system problems their immune systems are

856
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,720
weakened they're struggling zinc is

857
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:54,800
something the immune cells need to

858
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,880
strengthen move forward and attack bugs

859
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,480
that are in your system such as Epstein

860
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,040
