63
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,200
alexander alexander is here you love the

64
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
title of this podcast

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
the nightshade healer awesome awesome

66
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,520
incredible

67
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,520
and you know i know that a lot of people

68
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,680
are afraid of them because they have

69
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,880
misinformation

70
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,440
about potatoes and what they can do

71
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,360
and the power they have as a healer and

72
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
how we can't underestimate them and how

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
we take them for granted

74
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,400
it's unbelievable so um look

75
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
i'll tell you right now when it comes

76
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
down to potatoes

77
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
it's vast as far as what they can do for

78
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
our body

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
and there's a lot of confusion about

80
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,040
potato like what to eat them with and

81
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,239
that's a big problem all its own because

82
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,239
you might somebody that might be

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,319
somebody that puts oil on them

84
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,319
you might be somebody that puts sour

85
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,400
cream cheese on them

86
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,440
butter in them and that's where the

87
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
problem lies

88
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,959
it's right there it's one of the

89
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
problems because that's a big deal i'm

90
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
going to talk about also the sabotage

91
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,000
the sabotage on the potato okay we'll

92
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
talk a little bit about that too

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
about how the nightshade fear kicked

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,360
into gear

95
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,280
and when it did it really basically

96
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,120
stopped people from healing stopped a

97
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
lot of people from being able to heal

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
because then they get afraid and they're

99
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
often whoa it's this nightshade right

100
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,800
here

101
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,480
this is what's wrong this is what's

102
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
bothering me like you know and

103
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720

glad that's amazing

107
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
um and you know it look the bottom line

108
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,480
is

109
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
this episode is so packed there's

110
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,760
michelle michelle's there michelle said

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
the end is amazing

112
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
michelle did you hear that hidden

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,159
message in the ending and so i'm not

114
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
sure

115
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
if you're picking anything off in there

116
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,000
and that the ending of

117
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
the potato show but there's some

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
powerful messages in there in that

119
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
ending

120
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
um you know somewhere like three

121
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,480
quarters in

122
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,760
three quarters in on that ending

123
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,040
somewhere around there

124
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
this is real powerful messages uh kaylee

125
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,560
i have hashimoto's and i heard

126
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,120
nightshades are bad for autoimmune

127
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
diseases is this true it's not true

128
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,760
now kaylee here's how it works okay well

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
no one knows

130
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,120
how autoimmune disease even starts or

131
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519
even occurs or what causes it so

132
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,280
and all they think is your body's

133
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,080
attacking itself which is actually a

134
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
theory

135
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
so here we go we have this autoimmune

136
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
theory autoimmunity as far as symptoms

137
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,479
are real and hashimoto's

138
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,840
is real i have books written about that

139
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,359
and there's a book behind me cleansed to

140
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,560
heal with packed information about

141
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,280
hashimoto's

142
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,840
hyperthyroidism and everything so but

143
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
what you need to understand is that um

144
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,080
when it comes down to

145
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
people saying well a nightshade's bad or

146
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,759
a potato is bad if you have hashimoto's

147
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
well that's interesting because

148
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,280
they don't know the cause of hashimoto's

149
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,840
so okay so

150
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,360
how do they know what's bad for

151
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
hashimoto's how do they know what caught

152
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,000
like

153
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,320
what can if you don't know what causes

154
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,040
the thyroid problem or hypothyroid

155
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,639
or hyperthyroidism or nodules or cysts

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,560
and you don't know the cause of those

157
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
then why is everybody such an expert as

158
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
saying no stay away from potatoes if you

159
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
got hashimoto's

160
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,440
well the funny thing is is that the

161
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,479
medical medium information

162
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,360
allows for potatoes with hashimoto's

163
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,039
and guess what more people healed their

164
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,199
hashimoto's thyroiditis

165
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
with medical medium information all

166
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,759

proven proven results than anybody else

168
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,240
so it's like okay

169
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
all right well hey potatoes are bad for

170
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
your thyroid potatoes are bad for you

171
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440

172
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,600

troublemaker for diabetics

208
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
the potato

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
reverse

212
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,960

214
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
um you know i have a stack of potatoes

and put it behind you if you know some

222
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
of the tools

223
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680

224
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199

268
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,200
that so it's really important

269
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,279
emma says thank you for confirming

270
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
potatoes are good for us i grew up on

271
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,240
potatoes and i'm so relieved

272
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,480
can enjoy this okay so

273
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
here's the thing potatoes are really

274
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
good for us

275
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
and i'm just going to mention a couple

276
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
of tidbits right here there's zinc in

277
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,720
the skin

278
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,080
so zinc is critical for our immune

279
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,279
system it's critical for

280
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,120
our survival here and

281
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,680
so in zinc there's trace mineral zinc

282
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,880
inside the skins of potatoes so

283
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,720
if you're going to eat potatoes and

284
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,720
there's all kinds of nutrients and trace

285
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
minerals inside the potato too

286
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
so lots of nutrients and trace minerals

287
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,800
inside the potato

288
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,200
but in the skin itself it's got a high

289
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,920
amount of zinc and that's a critical

290
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,680
mineral

291
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
that we need too and i'll talk about

292
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,839
some other stuff as well

293
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
um i know you a lot of you guys are

294
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,800
afraid of nightshades you're told to

295
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,480
stay away from a nightshade you're told

296
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,920
to stay away from potatoes and that

297
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
a potato and that's where we get in

298
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,200
trouble that's where we lose an

299
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,600
opportunity to heal

300
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
that's when we can't fix things i talk

301
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
about in the episode so just so you know

302
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,200

all through the years incredible

338
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
incredible

339
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
uh sharon the potato skins make my mouth

340
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,680
burn

341
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
like i ate pepper or spice if i don't

342
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
eat the skins do i

343
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,560
do i not get sick you still get zing

344
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,800
from it sharon you still do

345
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,079
but you get the normal amount of zinc

346
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,160
and maybe that other

347
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,360
fruits and vegetables and different

348
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,120
things have so

349
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
and herbs and wild foods so you get the

350
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,760
normal amount but there's a little bit

351
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,440
more on the skin it's okay you don't

352
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
need to eat the skin you can peel the

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
potatoes without a doubt

354
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,360
you can easily do that and what you'll

355
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,760
notice that

356
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
if you try different potatoes maybe you

357
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,839
might not get that sensation with

358
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
another one because the skins are grippy

359
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,640
and when the skins are grippy

360
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,200
because that's what they are they're

361
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,240
grippy skins sometimes what they do

362
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,560
is if you're sensitive um you know

363
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
what happens is the grippy skin it you

364
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,880
can kind of just

365
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,880
it it's kind of one of those things

366
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,279
where it rubs a little bit and that's

367
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
how it gets rid of the bad bacteria too

368
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
so when you're eating these potatoes bad

369
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
bacteria that's in our gut

370
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
that causes sibo that causes all kinds

371
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,200
of gastritis

372
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
cramping and bloating the potato grabs

373
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
onto it and starts to pull it all out of

374
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
the intestinal tract

375
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
it's like it's it's a really powerful

376
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,279
healing and cleansing food for the

377
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,320
digestive tract

378
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
and the inside of the potato there's

379
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
these little

380
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,200
stringy things inside the potato you

381
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
can't really see them but stringy fibers

382
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,839
and when they go into you

383
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,600
they bind on to bacteria and roll it up

384
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,959
and pull it out of the body so

385
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
if you hear out there i don't eat

386
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,279
potatoes and you know they're not good

387
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,880
that's ridiculous they're one of the

388
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
most important foods

389
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,560
i mean if you want to eat them you don't

390
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
have to you don't have to

391
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,160
christine said potatoes are high in

392
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
potassium i'm at a dangerous level of

393
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,360
potassium

394
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
if you have a potassium level where

395
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
you're at some kind of dangerous level

396
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,240
potassium your doctor feels like you're

397
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,959
at a dangerous level of potassium then

398
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
you got to watch

399
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,720
everything you eat so just every single

400
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,399
foods you eat

401
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
you have to look out because potatoes

402
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,040
not the highest in potassium

403
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
um and there's lots of foods that are

404
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,399
higher in potassium

405
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
so you have to look out so christine

406
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,160
definitely keep an eye on out you know

407
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
don't do a potato if your doctor doesn't

408
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
want you because of potassium but look

409
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,720
out for of course your potassium levels

410
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
on all foods

411
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
it's it's something that's really smart

412
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,519

acv

486
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
to slow down the release of insulin so

487
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
you know the thing is well that's a

488
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,839
that's a theory it slows down the

489
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
release of

490
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
insulin um you know that's that's that's

491
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
a good theory there's lots of theories

492
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,040
out there as far as far as what happens

493
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,920
and what doesn't but

494
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,959
the key is with potatoes is any kind of

495
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,079
insulin problems

496
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,000
that can happen with any kind of food is

497
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
you have to make sure you're not dousing

498
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,560
it with

499
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,839
oil you're not dumping lots of oil on

500
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
your potatoes or

501
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,079
any food really and you got to make sure

502
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
you're not having potatoes with

503
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,759
another fat like too much fat you don't

504
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,800
want potatoes with

505
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,440
turkey fat you don't want potatoes with

506
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
beef fat you don't want potatoes with

507
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,040
chicken

508
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,720
fat so that's where the insulin stuff

509
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
happens and that's one of the keys you

510
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
need to know but that's like that with

511
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,079
everything you don't want to have bread

512
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,839
with chicken so if you have a chicken

513
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,480
sandwich you're having your

514
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
chicken fat with your carbohydrate your

515
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,880
bread

516
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,320
even if it's a gluten-free bread even if

517
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,040
it's a whole grain bread

518
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,959
even if it's a wholesome grain in

519
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,959
gluten-free grain if you have it

520
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,120
with your chicken grease or you have it

521
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,079
with your turkey grease or turkey fat

522
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,360
if you have it with you know if you have

523
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,680
a steak sandwich

524
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
or something you're having fat with a

525
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,360
carb

526
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,079
that's how the insulin goes off the

527
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,279
charts

528
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,639
that's how the a1c goes up see so that's

529
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,120
how it works with the whole

530
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,160
insulin diabetes but we don't have it's

531
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
like that information

532
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,000
is just for some reason just it's not

533
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
out there so people just struggle and

534
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
they

535
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
keep their their insulins all over the

536
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
place their numbers are all over the

537
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,559
place

538
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
they're up and down they're a1c they got

539
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,559
insulin resistance no one's teaching

540
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,079
them how it works no one's saying

541
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,319
don't have a carb of any kind with

542
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,520
a fat no one's saying don't have sweet

543
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,400
potatoes

544
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,000
with turkey at the same time no one's

545
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
saying don't have sweet potatoes

546
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,039
with i'm just talking about anything

547
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,480
like sweet potatoes is

548
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,960
right there i mean so many people eat

549
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,559
them but they eat them with all that oil

550
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,480
and all that grease or whatever they're

551
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,080
eating them with um

552
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,440
so let's go into this part by the way

553
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,960
i'm taught i'm live right now i'm

554
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,080
i got a sack of potatoes right here i'm

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,200
talking about healing benefits i'm

557
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,360
talking about

558
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,559
how you shouldn't run from potatoes

559
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,559
because of hearing it's a nightshade

560
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,720
misinformation as far as how that works

561
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,559
out there okay it can stop you from

562
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,240
healing i talked a little bit about food

563
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,440
poisoning i think i still will where

564
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,840
potatoes are

565
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
a saving grace for post-food poisoning

566
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
for recovery

567
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160

um so key factor right here

609
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,039
anti-viral this is an antiviral food

610
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
why should you care anything autoimmune

611
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,919
is viral so hey i just got diagnosed

612
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,679
with an autoimmune condition

613
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
i got diagnosed with lupus got diagnosed

614
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,360
with multiple sclerosis

615
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
ra rheumatoid arthritis i got diagnosed

616
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,120
with chronic fatigue syndrome

617
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,240
fibromyalgia neurological lyme

618
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,480
and i got autoimmune now well

619
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,240
that's viral that's what that is i talk

620
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
about that in the books

621
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,679
and that's viral so these are anti-viral

622
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,080
food this is an antiviral food

623
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,120
right here so what does that mean when

624
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,679
you're eating this

625
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,799
you're actually working on healing and

626
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
getting better

627
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,320
getting better um

628
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,360
yeah michelle's right don't eat potatoes

629
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
with green skin

630
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
or sprouts i talk about that in the

631
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,159
episode so

632
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,200
here's the thing you're eating potatoes

633
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
to go after bugs that are in our system

634
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
gotta remember that so if you're

635
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,600
diagnosed with autoimmune

636
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
what's happening is you got this

637
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,480
underlying viral condition

638
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,000
okay it's the epstein bars it's the

639
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,080
shingles varieties

640
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,919
it's it's a mega virus people walk

641
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,679
around this all day long they're filled

642
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,039
with these bugs but the bugs eventually

643
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
get a little out of control

644
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,600
and then you get swollen joints you get

645
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,919
dizziness aches and pains ringing in the

646
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,360
ears you get hashimoto's thyroiditis

647
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,039
that's caused by epstein-barr virus and

648
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,960
so when you go through all that you're

649
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,520
having all these symptoms and conditions

650
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
and you get the the autoimmune diagnosis

651
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
then you're

652
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,600
you're dealing with low-grade viral

653
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,720
infections or sometimes more than

654
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,320
low-grade

655
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
well this is an antiviral food i talk

656
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,080
about this in the episode

657
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
so medical medium podcast at apple

658
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,400
podcast

659
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,200
guys why do i want you to listen to the

660
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
podcast

661
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,480
i have no advertisers so i'm not making

662
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,120
money

663
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,240
i have no infomercials i'm not making

664
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
money so

665
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
why do i want you to listen to the

666
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
medical medium podcast at apple podcast

667
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
so

668
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,159
badly like because what happens is if

669
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,240
you have all these advertisers on there

670
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,600
and sponsors and advertisers then you

671
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
end up you know you end up making all

672
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,240
this money right

673
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,760
and that's that would be a reason to

674
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,320
push you all there okay

675
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,159
well i'm not doing that so why do i want

676
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,000
you to actually listen to the medical

677
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,039
beam podcast at apple podcast

678
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,080

packed with information

682
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
and because i created it in a way that's

683
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
a docu-series

684
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,559
style podcast it's not coffee talk and

685
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,120
it's not throw away

686
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,200

you guys are you keeping track

705
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
of the half moon because the moon

706
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
meditation is

707
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
critical on the half moon so i want to

708
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,360
tell the rain that

709
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,720
lorraine says your meditations are the

710
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
best so healing

711
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,159
lorraine do you know about doing them on

712
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,320
the half moon i bet you do

713
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
and that's a key time to do it that's

714
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,799
what i do and i do it on the full moon

715
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
for about

716
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,039
seven days during a full moon cycle and

717
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,159
then i do seven days during the half

718
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,159
moon cycle

719
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,600
because what happens it's all about the

720
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,240
magnetic pull

721
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,840
something changes the axis of the earth

722
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,919
where the moon is at that time

723
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,200
and you know where we are in our space

724
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,280
and time now

725
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,280
like in history each day as each day

726
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
unfolds so i like to do it use that

727
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
healing of the moon's power

788
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440

on there i put regular onions on there

792
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
that's just what i like to do so the

793
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,360
point is

794
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,279
i want you guys to hear the episode so

795
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,840
you can learn about how to use these

796
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
babies

797
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,400
how to heal how to get your life back

798
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,080
each tool counts

799
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
every little tool counts medical

800
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,760
medium tool and i said medical medium

801
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,799
tool because people don't know

802
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,000
they never knew keep these plain keep

803
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,520
them steamed and

804
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,039
you know you can make them with other

805
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,559
food you can put other food in there but

806
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,559
try to keep the fats down

807
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,400
so you're not you're not dumping too

808
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,880
much fat on top of your potato sour

809
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,520
cream

810
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,960
cheese and and what else you know you

811
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
got to look out in butter you got to

812
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,400
look out

813
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,600
for that so so i want to talk about that

814
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,520
with potatoes is their anti-viral

815
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,960
so what they do is they have virus

816
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,200
killing properties

817
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,200
that means if you're already struggling

818
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,159
with something where you're sensitive

819
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,960
and you you get achy or your joints

820
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,600
bother you

821
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
or anything like that happens a couple

822
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,200
of things could go wrong

823
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
one is if you're eating potatoes and

824
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
you're eating them

825
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
with eggs if you're eating eggs in your

826
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
diet if you're eating potatoes and

827
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,200
eating butter with them

828
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,400
if you're eating potatoes and having

829
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,480
sour cream or milk or some kind of cream

830
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,640
or or butter with them like i said or

831
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,320
cheese or anything like that

832
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
if you're eating them with things like

833
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,760
that you're just gonna have more

834
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
problems because

835
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,679
dairy products feed the viruses so

836
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,240
that's what happens right there

837
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,520
it feeds the viruses and that's one

838
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
reason why you're going to get flare-ups

839
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
every now because you might be someone

840
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,880
that has like okay i'll try

841
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,400
a baked potato you go bake the potato

842
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
you throw butter in there and now you

843
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
get all the cinna flare up well you just

844
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
got to flare up because

845
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,039
the butter is feeding the bugs and

846
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,640
that's what happens there it's one

847
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,400
reason another reason why

848
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,400
that people feel like they may not feel

849
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,039
good after a potato some people is

850
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,080
because

851
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,159
they're killing viruses so here you are

852
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
somebody who's dealing with viruses

853
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,039
inside your liver

854
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,159
inside your body inside your intestinal

855
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,159
tract and

856
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,760
including also bacteria that shouldn't

857
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,039
be there like streptococcus and you're

858
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,240
eating potatoes and you're

859
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,840
killing these bugs when you kill bugs

860
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,360
and you get them out of the body

861
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
sometimes you don't feel so great for a

862
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,880
little bit

863
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,640
rebecca knight i've been told potatoes

864
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,960
aren't good for autoimmune diseases

865
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,000
there is so many different opinions it's

866
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,000
so hard

867
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
to know which way to turn well okay well

868
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
here's one thing rebecca that's so

869
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,640
important to know okay

870
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,799
um they don't know what causes

871
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
autoimmune so why are they the expert at

872
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,919
what to eat

873
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,520
i'm kind of confused about that that's a

874
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
head scratcher for me

875
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,760
um they don't know why anybody has

876
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
autoimmune they don't have answers for

877
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,399
autoimmune

878
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,399
everybody stays sick with their

879
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,120
autoimmune their whole life nothing

880
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
changes

881
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,720
they keep their lupus their whole life

882
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,360
they keep their fibromyalgia their whole

883
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,679
life

884
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,120
um the only thing they offer is drugs

885
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,919
and alternative medicine doesn't know

886
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,720
the cause of

887
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,919
fibromyalgia or lupus or hashimoto's

888
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,960
thyroiditis so

889
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,360
interesting how is everybody an expert

890
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,240
at what to eat and what to avoid when

891
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,080
they don't know why anybody's sick

892
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
once you realize that you know where you

893
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,720
can go a little bit because if you go in

894
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
here

895
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,559
and this right now thousands of doctors

896
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
are using this this book right now

897
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,320
around the world or the medical meeting

898
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
books

899
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,159
you learn what the cause of your problem

900
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,080
is i have it right in the book

901
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,440
when you learn the cause and you learn

902
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,559
what's in a food

903
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,679
then it rises above all that it takes it

904
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
way past all that

905
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,039
now you know why you're sick why i have

906
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,039
autoimmune

907
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,120
then you know what kills it off and

908
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,880
kills off the bugs that cause autoimmune

909
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,000
and you know how to heal and that's why

910
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,520
people heal with medical medium

911
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,159
information here's another thing

912
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,440
to keep in mind rebecca that's really

913
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,880
important is

914
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,360
medical medium information has already

915
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,600
been proven millions around the world

916
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,480
already doing healing thousands and

917
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,720
thousands of

918
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,880
of eczema cases reversed completely

919
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,240
reversed psoriasis cases when that never

920
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,039
happened in our history people just

921
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,279
didn't get

922
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,880
rid of their eczema that never happened

923
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,640
unless they just took drugs to suppress

924
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,640
it short time for a short moment

925
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
people just didn't just get rid of their

926
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,360
excellent psoriasis that started with

927
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,679
medical medium information

928
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,520
that never existed before that you just

929
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,120
debilitating cases of eczema

930
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,039
just didn't go away just because you get

931
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,760
rid of processed foods or try a fancy

932
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,919
diet

933
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,600
and it's already been proven already

934
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,720
happen so you have to think about that

935
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,080
so when you think about

936
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,760
who do i trust where do i go there's so

937
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,679
much information out there about

938
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,080

939
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,760

945
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,720

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,840
tori says steamed potatoes keeps more

984
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,200
nutrients intact

985
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,240
than baking the potatoes yes steaming

986
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,960
them is the key

987
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,760
boiling them you lose a lot of nutrients

988
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,519
for sure

989
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,799
boiling them but if you have to boil

990
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,399
them and make a soup

991
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,880
well them and make a soup you can do

992
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,600
that but really steaming them is so

993
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,720
so good and easy on the system it's a

994
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,880

995
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,640

996
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,799

997
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559

998
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,760

999
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,200

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,760
some plant fats with potato

1032
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,600
tahini sesame tahini and avocado

1033
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,600
are two great plant fats that you can

1034
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,720
actually you know use with potatoes so

1035
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,519
if you have a little

1036
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,320
tahini on top of your potato it's one

1037
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,360
option

1038
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,640
the other one is um avocado

1039
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,559
on potato that's kind of like the

1040
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,320
avocado toast but you put on avocado

1041
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,440
potatoes avocado potato

1042
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,760

1043
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,519
it's still best without having a fat

1044
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,200
with the potato but those are the best

1045
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,799
