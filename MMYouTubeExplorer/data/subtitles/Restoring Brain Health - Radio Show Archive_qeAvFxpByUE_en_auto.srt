00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,480
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,759
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,240
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,719
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,119
secrets about health much of which is

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,000
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:23,000
ahead of what's out there now and as

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,640
I've always said who has had 10 or 20 30

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,800
years to wait or waste away or lose or

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,880
four years to lose or 5 years to lose I

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
know I say this a lot but it's that

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,559
serious where when we're sick and we're

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,040
not feeling good waiting for answers

14
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,239
could feel like it's

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,160
forever and most importantly waiting for

16
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,559
real information to what's causing our

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,600
problems to what's causing our Agony you

18
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,559
know real information on what's wrong

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,399
and and that's a big part of it you know

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,039
I run into people all the time you guys

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,280
that they just want to know what's

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,399
what's the deal you know what's really

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,560
going on in their body cuzz when you

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,680
don't know what's going on in your body

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:12,000
you you can be lost you can feel really

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,000
lost so when you think about that that's

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,920
serious stuff we're talking about that's

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,560
really serious not knowing what's wrong

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
inside or inside our body makes things a

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,119
lot harder with healing it makes things

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,119
really difficult in healing it makes

32
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,040
things complicated it makes things a

33
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
little bit more you know challenging in

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,720
many different Avenues emotionally

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,040
physically mentally um for both families

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,479
and for someone's own you know being too

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,200
but the families around them they're

38
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,880
friends and you know what happens is

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,360
when we get sick and maybe you've

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,640
experienced this

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,000
before maybe you've you've you've had

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,280
this happen before but you have some

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,880
friends and you get sick and you you'll

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,520
lose a couple of friends meaning meaning

45
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,680
they just kind of don't really want to

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
be friends much more because they're

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,680
kind of tired of everybody being sick or

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,440
they're tired of you being sick or

49
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,400
they're tired they're having troubles

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,239
with that they're it's not easy for

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,599
them and you know friends we thought

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
were our friends are not our friends

53
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,400
anymore but then we find new friends we

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,239
find new friends along the way you know

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,360
we do find new friends that actually you

56
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,040
know see a different you know

57
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,480
understanding and under you know see

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,239
things differently and um and you know

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,720
one of the reasons why it's so so hard

60
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,440
on also with having sicknesses and

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,640
illnesses and having friends and family

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,280
and and you know because when we don't

63
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,200
know what's wrong or what's causing the

64
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,080
symptom and then you know I've seen

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,560
people they I've seen people come to me

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,360
and say look my friend doesn't even

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,280
believe me anymore um I saw something on

68
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,120
a television show just recently too um

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,840
where you know this person had

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,599
rheumatoid arthritis and was running to

71
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,640
doctor to doctor

72
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,879
but then she was also um you know she

73
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,879
was also kind of looking healthy she

74
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,480
looked healthy she looked fine and her

75
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,360
friends were starting to say Hey you

76
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,159
know I I don't even get it anymore you

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,760
look fine everything looks good are you

78
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,000
just kind of like is this kind of a game

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,120
and it really hurt the person's feelings

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,239
with ra with rheumatoid arthritis and

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,280
you know to be kind of insulted to that

82
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,640
level

83
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,439
and look maybe you've look maybe you've

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,720
known somebody maybe you've done this to

85
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:41,000
someone where someone was years ago and

86
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,239
somebody was sick and you know and that

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,959
happened and you and you and you you

88
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,200
know thought somebody was kind of Faking

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,920
It faking it um so you know it it's It

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,560
Maybe not maybe somebody did it to you

91
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,000
I've seen it happen over the years I've

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,079
talked to a lot of people and a big part

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,200
of this is the no answers just there's

94
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,360
no answers

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,439
and they're really not out there we get

96
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,159
some diagnoses we get some labels but

97
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,159
the answers really aren't there and

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,840
that's what makes it so hard for for

99
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,560
everybody that's sick and then knowing

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,799
what connects to what like what's

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,040
causing those symptoms what's causing

102
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,560
those problems and then if you can't see

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,199
the illness you really can't see it if

104
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,360
it's not blatantly in front of you then

105
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:28,919
you know people say well you look fine

106
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,320
well you look good maybe you're just you

107
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,199
know looking for attention oh maybe

108
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,039
that's Sally just looking for attention

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,960
maybe that's um you know maybe you're

110
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,800
just maybe you're overreacting you know

111
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,080
I've had people say to people I got

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,600
aches and pains too I got problems too I

113
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,479
got this you don't see me complaining

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
you know there's there's so much going

115
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,000
on out there but but here's the deal

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,960
when you know what's causing your

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,720
problems when you learn what's behind

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,520
your illness and what's connecting the

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
dots and the pieces of the puzzle and

120
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,400
you know what they really are are and

121
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
you're not lost on the internet and

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,440
you're not lost out there looking for

123
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,080
things and when you when you find these

124
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,639
answers it makes a world of a diff

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,919
difference and that's what the medical

126
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,520
medium shows about who's got 10 years

127
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,560
who's got 20 years to wait for this

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
these answers no we want to we want to

129
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,919
get down to it and we want it we want

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,160
those answers now and it's important for

131
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,520
our children it's important for our

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,319
loved ones that we've lost you know it's

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,120
important for the you know four four

135
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,560
fathers and four mothers of the

136
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,080
past it it's in it's important for all

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,960
of these reasons and so we're on it

mass we lose you know we lose our brains

149
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,240

causing lots of

159
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,120
symptoms and we're getting brains that

160
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,280

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,080
illnesses and and symptoms and diseases

184
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,280
okay how to connect the dots what foods

185
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,599
help information that doesn't exist

186
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,280
anywhere else on wild Foods herbs and

187
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:48,240
spices on vegetables on fruits how to

188
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,520
protect yourself from the unforgiving

189
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,879
for the unforgiving for that everybody

190
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,960
ignores that's destroying our lives

191
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,919
making us sick that's making us decline

192
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,120
everybody's ignoring it the trends and

193
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,240
the fads are ignoring it you know all

194
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,240
the fads and different Trends they're

195
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,280
you know they're all the you know the

196
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,720
hip you know books out there hip

197
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,319
information hip internet information all

198
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,120
ignoring it because they don't know

199
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,280
about the unforgiving for it's in this

200
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,000
book I can't say it enough try to try to

201
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,000
lo you know try to grab yourself a copy

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Lo meaning get your name on a copy

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,440
before it even comes out so you don't

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
have to wait forever and it's out of

205
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,879
stock and all that stuff like what

206
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,400
happened with the medical medium

207
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,800
original book and this one I think will

208
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,839
be worse in that in that department so

209
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,240
anyway listen let's talk about the brain

210
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
I'm I'm here I'm I'm with you now I just

211
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,719
want you to fast in the seat bels for

212
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,680
this this ride and um because and we're

213
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,480
we're hitting a rocket ship on this one

214
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,839
well I mean we're in a rocket ship on

215
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:51,040
this one um so you know take a deep

216
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,279
breath and relax and uh take another

217
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
deep breath after that and then relax

218
00:08:54,279 --> 00:09:00,480
cuz we're about to take off and you want

219
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:04,040
to be slightly Calm before we take off

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,959
so brain shrinking what the heck am I

221
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,399
talking about with brain shrinking what

222
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,560
am I talking about okay well brain

223
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,440
shrinking is the

224
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,760
loss of carbohydrates in the brain the

225
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:25,440
loss of carbohydrates in the

226
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:30,680
brain yes yeah the loss of glycogen in

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,720
your brain and we get older we lose

228
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,279
glycogen storage in our brain what is

229
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,160
that what is glycogen sto do you know

230
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,000
what glycogen storage is you probably

231
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,160
somebody probably does out there what is

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,200
glycogen storage and glycogen storage is

233
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,160
sugar the loss of

234
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:55,240
sugar imagine that the loss of sugar in

235
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,240
our brain okay so why is that important

236
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,760
like why why should we care sugar

237
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,920
Sugar's bad Sugar's bad for you wait a

238
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,920
minute it's all about fat now no lots of

239
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,640
fat no protein it's all about protein

240
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,279
protein protein which is basically lots

241
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,399
of fat protein and that's all that we

242
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,279
care about

243
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,760
nowadays well all that does is Fast

244
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:19,519
Track us to to a brain that shrinks more

245
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,320
and to a more unhealthier brain and to

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
brain diseases and Alzheimer's and

247
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:29,519
Dementia and everything around brain

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:35,680
diseases we know today so the brain is

249
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:38,600
made out of this dense amount of

250
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,000
carbohydrates that have like that have t

251
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,040
it's a carbohydrate ball of it basically

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
because carbohydrates is one of the keys

253
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,360
to conducting

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
electricity it's one of the keys of

255
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,880
cooling down the

256
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,839
engine see our brains get hot they get

257
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,800
hot and you have to have sugar to cool

258
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,720
them down you got to have carbohydrates

259
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,440
to cool down the brain now I'm sure some

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,079
of you are out there saying okay this is

261
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,519
this is bull

262
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,079
crap this is bull because he's talking

263
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,519
about sugar Sugar's bad for you what's

264
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,959
he talking about I'm not talking about

265
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,639
corn syrup I'm not talking about I'm not

266
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,160
talking about table sugar I'm not

267
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,720
talking about chocolate cake I'm not

268
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,720
talking about chocolate donuts I'm not

269
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,560
talking about powdered Donuts here's the

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,040
deal okay we're not talking about that

271
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,519
we're not talking about that kind of

272
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,519
sugar and you got to know this I just

273
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,200
got to make sure that that gets across

274
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,560
because I know a few of you are going to

275
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,279
be already peed

276
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,959
off you're going to be already upset and

277
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:51,160
frustrated but the brain is made out of

278
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,760
sugar and there's a little bit of fat in

279
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,320
the brain not a lot the brain doesn't

280
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,320
have a lot of fat at all in it very

281
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,600
little micro micro micro

282
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,120
small micro

283
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,240
small

284
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,560
literally like we're talking like less

285
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,880
than

286
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:19,160
10% and the fat that's in the brain is

287
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:21,920
just highly highly rare rare oils that

288
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:26,880
the body practically

289
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:30,480
produces and we receive from Foods rare

290
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,279
oils it's not what runs the brain it's

291
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,600
just a fraction of brain health so right

292
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
now you're going to hear about Omega-3s

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,920
you're going to hear about Omas fish

294
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,480
oils oh it's for the brain it's all the

295
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,240
brain outdated outdated outdated go to

296
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,000
the Antique sh shop I've been saying

297
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,600
that too many times lately someone told

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,079
me the other day I think my assistant

299
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,920
said to me said you got to stop throwing

300
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,959
the antique thing out at

301
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,680
everybody I can't help it because you're

302
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,079
shopping for antiques with the

303
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,600
information that's brand new off the

304
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,360
press right now and brain health and

305
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
everything else around it I don't care

306
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,040
what came out two years ago what came

307
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,800
out one year ago what's coming out next

308
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,360
year if it doesn't say your brain is

309
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
made out of 90% carbohydrates that's

310
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,680
part of it we're going to cover some of

311
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,079
the rest of it and then a small

312
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,560
percentage a small

313
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:25,360
percentage of things like squalene and

314
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,440
things like omegas re you know DHA EPA

315
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
but on a small

316
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,720
fraction okay

317
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,160
and that that very little fat and then

318
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,240
the rest the rest is

319
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,519
minerals

320
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,519
minerals and of course there's cells and

321
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,560
neurons and they're there too you got

322
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,440
your gal cells you got your neurons

323
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,160
those are there too they're all wrapped

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,759
in and around lots of stored glycogen

325
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,880
that was built up when you were a baby

326
00:13:54,759 --> 00:14:00,920
in the womb from your

327
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:05,480
mommy eating anything that had sugar in

328
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,079
it anything that had sugar in it when a

329
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,240
mom goes carb free

330
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,079
pregnant the baby the baby's brain

331
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,199
suffers when a mom goes carb-free

332
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,720
pregnant and one of the one of the

333
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,920
greatest mistakes in the world is

334
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,320
lowering carbs with a

335
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,440
pregnancy okay so we got to make sure

336
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,000
your carbs are up it's very important

337
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,639
because that initial storage you're not

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,880
hear you're not hear this from anywhere

339
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,440
this isn't good you're not going to hear

340
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,240
this stuff from anywhere this is why

341
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
we're here at the medical Medium show

342
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,720
this is why Spirits giving us this

343
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,920
information so we can protect ourselves

344
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
and our family and move forward and heal

345
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,839
I don't want anybody in the dark anymore

346
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,720
and you know what happens is those

347
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,199
critical storage bins of carbohydrates

348
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,560
that mommy's eating while pregnant

349
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:59,320
becomes the backbone to brain

350
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:03,160
tissue becomes reserves car carbohydrate

351
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,920
reserves glycogen storages to make the

352
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,600
brain grow and

353
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,199
become and so we start with that and we

354
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,759
keep that it's it's

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,800
imperative so our brain is mostly

356
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,600
comprised of a sugar and runs on sugar

357
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,880
it runs on sugar you know what you know

358
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,360
how I pick on medical research and

359
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,199
medical science a lot and you know and I

360
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,440
don't mean in um heart transplants and I

361
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,399
don't mean in broken legs and I don't

362
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,120
mean when you need a great surgeon

363
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,519
surgeons are you know gifted incredible

364
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,199
gifted men and women on the planet um

365
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,680
and and you know when we need them we

366
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,160
need them when things happen to us we

367
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,519
need them when we go through all

368
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,880
different kinds of crises like your

369
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,800
gallbladder explodes because you weren't

370
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,319
taking care of your gallbladder for 30

371
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,160
years um you know that kind of thing um

372
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:53,319
aneurysm in the brain you know we need a

373
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,399
brain we need a brain surgeon with Rob

374
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,079
you know with robots with a robot that

375
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,440
go in there and literally remove an

376
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,360
aneurysm and

377
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,519
and I got tremendous respect for doctors

378
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
and practitioners I'm talking about

379
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,480
medical re research it's science that

380
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,079
doesn't understand chronic illness one

381
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,680
bit on any

382
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,839
level and what happens here is that um

383
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,680
with medical research and medical

384
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,040
science there was a great discovery and

385
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,240
you know I'm always picking on research

386
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,800
and science but there was a great

387
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,279
discovery that the brain ran on

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,199
sugar you focus on just protein and fats

389
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,560
and you starve your body of

390
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,759
carbohydrates your brain will shrink and

391
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,279
it'll shrink faster sure you may not

392
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
notice it when you're 30 years old and

393
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,160
your your low carb and you're exercising

394
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,839
you're low carb and you're 30 years old

395
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,079
you're not going to notice it you'll

396
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,240
notice it when it hits you when you're

397
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,440
60 for what you did when you were 30

398
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,600
it's that imperative that we have

399
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,399
carbohydrates and before anybody else

400
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,279
gets upset at me hold back your rotten

401
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:47,000
tomatoes and your potatoes and the rocks

402
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,360
that you want to probably Stone me to

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,240
death with for for people who just don't

404
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,399
like this topic because it's it's

405
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,160
controversial uh and I'm on your side

406
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,279
without I get it contral stuff can just

407
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,959
you know get anybody upset but before

408
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,120
you you know before you throw a Stone

409
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,120
you know you you have to understand that

410
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,079
I'm also not talking about bad

411
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,319
carbohydrates I'm not talking about you

412
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,079
know wheat I'm not talking about wheat

413
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,880
gluten I you know well glutens are

414
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,520
proteins but I'm not talking about wheat

415
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,160
I'm not talking about bad bad

416
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,400
carbohydrates okay I'm not talking about

417
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,919
corn and um so so basically the first

418
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,280
understanding is what the brain's made

419
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,839
out of because if you don't know what

420
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,120
you're made out of then guess what

421
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,400
you're not going to do the right things

422
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,960
and guess what we're not going to take

423
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,280
care of our brain and guess what we're

424
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,440
totally going to be you know messed up

425
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,840
from it or we're going to cheat

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,200
ourselves out of something we're going

427
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:42,080
to lose out we're going to lose out I

428
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,520
don't want anybody losing out so um so

429
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,679
we got to get into this a little bit so

430
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,440
electricity runs hot our brains run hot

431
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,960
when we go through trouble when we have

432
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,640
problems in our lives our brains heat up

433
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,440
anxiety heats up the brain stress heats

434
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,880
up the

435
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,360
brain you can't be carb free while under

436
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,760
stress you will dissolve I've seen

437
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,799
people do it they dissolve they're like

438
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,240
a puddle they just dissolve and they

439
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,159
melt you carbs are critical for the

440
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,840
brain to keep the brain cool and

441
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,080
calm now it is true that there are some

442
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,320
essential oils that I'm talking about

443
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,960
not essential oils but essential omegas

444
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,960
that are critical for the brain and

445
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:30,240
brain health you know like pumpkin seed

446
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,440
oil okay hemp seed oil um you know that

447
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
kind of thing it is important because it

448
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,840
does comprise of part of the brain but

449
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
but that isn't what runs the whole

450
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,480
machine that's what I'm talking

451
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
about so to keep our brains from

452
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
shrinking as we get older so we don't

453
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,039
get all kinds of diseases and brain

454
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,480
diseases and memory loss and everything

455
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:54,600
else we got to make sure we have

456
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,400
glycogen storage banks in the brain

457
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,280
keeping that tissue good so that's the

458
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,919
first thing to understand so what that

459
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,720
means is sweet potatoes it means regular

460
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,919
potato it means and at wait and before

461
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,320
you pick on me about potato being a

462
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,159
white food it's not a white food it's

463
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,600
not a white food you guys it's not I

464
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:17,000
know everybody's not saying anything I'm

465
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,320
just saying I I I feel someone's out

466
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,600
there saying he's talking about a white

467
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,039
food now someone new on listening in is

468
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,799
saying he's talking about a white food

469
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,520
now hang on hang on okay

470
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,480
the skin of the food determines if it's

471
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,919
a white food or not you got a red

472
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,480
skinned potato you got a red food you

473
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,760
got a purple skinned potato you got a

474
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,559
purple food you got a brown skinned

475
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,480
potato you got a brown

476
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,000
food you you have a you know a gold

477
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,919
skinned potato you got a gold

478
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,720
food okay you cut it open and you got

479
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,640
white inside but that's not processed

480
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,960
that's a whole food loaded with minerals

481
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,280
and vitamins lyine to stop viruses and

482
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,640
diseases that's what's in a potato okay

483
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280
okay you take a cultivated blueberry

484
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
which I don't like by the way I don't

485
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,559
like cultivated blueberries I mean they

486
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,720
they got Health to them they're healthy

487
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,520
but it's the Frozen wild blueberry that

488
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,120
holds all the power but just let's move

489
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,200
over the the Frozen wild blueberry

490
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,280
because when you open up a FL Frozen

491
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,039
wild blueberry it's blue

492
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:21,440
inside it's

493
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:24,559
blue like blue like real blue like real

494
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,440
blue you open up a big cultivated round

495
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,880
uh cultivated blueberry in the clamshell

496
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,840
you pick up the fresh blueberries in the

497
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,760
clam shell you open that up it's white

498
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,960
inside want to call that a white food

499
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,559
let's call that a white food if you're

500
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,679
going to call a potato a white food

501
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,039
you're your blueberry that you're

502
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,679
probably throwing in your smoothie let's

503
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,080
call that a white food it's not a white

504
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,720
food it's a blue food even the

505
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,520
cultivated blueberry is a blue food

506
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
let's talk about a radish let's cut open

507
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,320
a radish it's white inside it's a red

508
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,280
food and purple food depending if it's a

509
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,600
purple radish or red radish and the

510
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,960
potato is the same way it's not a white

511
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,640
food this is another mistake I'm

512
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,679
clearing up as we run into these as we

513
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,960
need food foods for ourselves I have to

514
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,919
clear up some of these trendy mistakes

515
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,200
and

516
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:06,360
misconceptions for you guys because

517
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,840
there's so many of them they're like

518
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,440
landmines that poison our ground they're

519
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,480
like like landmines that are there to De

520
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,159
you know to literally you know basically

521
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,679
detonate and knock us off our tracks and

522
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,600
this is part of why people don't heal

523
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,279
every one of these counts it's why we're

524
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,960
that's why spirit and I when I say we're

525
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:27,799
spirit and I are loading these things up

526
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,640
in our books this book coming out life

527
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,520
Chang ing Foods we need to have the

528
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,480
information the medical meaning book we

529
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,600
need to have it out here we can't be

530
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,360
doing this anymore we got to make sure

531
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,440
everybody has that so brain shrinking is

532
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,240
when we lose our carbohydrate reserves

533
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,279
our brain squee you know they squeeze

534
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:51,480
down and they shrink all right brain

535
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:53,039
swelling brain swelling is mild en

536
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,720
sephtis that's not

537
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,520
diagnosed from viruses that's what

538
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,720
people with Lyme disease get people with

539
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,840
multiple SC osis get people with ala get

540
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,320
I mean ALS get people with um all these

541
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,799
different problems and their brains they

542
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,960
get swelling in different parts of their

543
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,360
brain it's hard to pick up on CAT scans

544
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,640
you can't pick it up on MRIs and you get

545
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,000
brain

546
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
inflammation and so that's something

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,880
that's caused by

548
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,640
viruses viruses such as um you know hhv6

549
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,200
viruses such as shingles different

550
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,480
varieties of shingles um even different

551
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,400
varieties of Epstein bar can do it you

552
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,919
know V is actually in cause inflammation

553
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:38,960
in the brain because the nervous system

554
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,799
is inflamed from neurotoxins so

555
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,400
neurotoxins neurotoxins are pro produced

556
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,440
by viruses they float around in the

557
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,000
bloodstream they get into the brain and

558
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,720
they give us brain fog memory loss all

559
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,039
kinds of problems they give us migraines

560
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,880
they make us susceptible they give us

561
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:56,120
SES and pains they hurt our eyes they

562
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,360
give us all kinds of weird stuff in the

563
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,440
brain and those are neurotoxins from

564
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,320
viral debris and stuff and then we have

565
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,840
heavy metals lots of heavy metals in our

566
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,360
brains and we got to get the heavy

567
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
metals out we got to get the viral

568
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
toxins out that are floating around in

569
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,760
the body we got to get that out of the

570
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,760
brain got to get the heavy metals out so

571
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,760
listen you know because we we don't have

572
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,480
a a ton of time today you just make sure

573
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,600
you know you do the heavy metal detox

574
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,000
that I talk about um check that out the

575
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,320
heavy metal detox it's in the first

576
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,799
medical medium book and you get the

577
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,120
metals at of your brain and we'll talk

578
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,760
about some foods you know to kind of

579
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,279
help that along as a little later on uh

580
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,240
today with this with this um Talk um so

581
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,799
we want to make sure we get those Metals

582
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,200
out of our brain too so it's a whole

583
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,600
another thing Mercury lead cadmium

584
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,840
arsenic copper our brains are filled

585
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
with copper a lot of times you know

586
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,919
that's a whole another thing there's

587
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,799
copper everywhere which reminds me if

588
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
you're somebody that is afraid to take

589
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,360
zinc because you're going to lose your

590
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,360
copper storage that's another trendy

591
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
mistake that's it's another

592
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,760
misconception that's out there first of

593
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,440
all we're loaded with hard copper all of

594
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,400
us are loaded with hard copper okay it's

595
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,760
in our livers it's in our brains people

596
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,919
with examen psoriasis have way more in

597
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:18,159
their liver with Co copper but it's in

598
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,159
us and the only way to get it out is to

599
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,880
do things to take out heavy metals like

600
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,520
like in the book I talk about the barley

601
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,880
grass the wild blueberries the spirulina

602
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,880
the cilantro and the dols and that helps

603
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:36,520
get it out but understand that when you

604
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,960
take zinc zinc won't remove the mineral

605
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,120
copper that we have the precious mineral

606
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,159
copper that we have in our body that we

607
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,520
use the zinc a high quality zinc only

608
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:52,120
removes if at best hard copper the stuff

609
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:55,200
we're loaded with and food is has tons

610
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,480
of copper in it both the mineral

611
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,200
itself you know the trace mineral itself

612
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,799
copper and both the bad copper you know

613
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,520
on different foods if it's or if it's

614
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:06,520
conventional produce bad copper is going

615
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,399
to be on it if it's um not not

616
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,799
traditional produce if it's conventional

617
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:12,799
produce if it's organic it'll still have

618
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,000
the mineral copper in it because it's

619
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,159
it's plentiful in our soils zinc doesn't

620
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,799
exist

621
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,919
anymore it doesn't it doesn't exist

622
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,279
anymore it's not even in pumpkin seeds

623
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,120
barely anymore so we need our zinc

624
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,600
supplements it helps us with the brain

625
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:32,000
health it helps us with everything

626
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,080
it helps it helps keate bad metals like

627
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,360
the copper out of us the bad copper so

628
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,840
don't be afraid to taking a little bit

629
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,559
of zinc so you just want to clear that

630
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,799
up so our

631
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,919
brains okay let me tell you something

632
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,039
about it and I talked about this before

633
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,720
in in a in um in another podcast in

634
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,039
another radio show I talked about it and

635
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,480
our brains

636
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,440
actually if there are people out there

637
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,240
that eat brain they eat sheep brain cow

638
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,559
brain brain goat brain lamb brain

639
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,679
there's people out there eating brains

640
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,640
out there I don't recommend it I don't

641
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,480
at all I I don't like the brain eating

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,480
thing I just can't get I can't wrap my I

643
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,559
can't wrap my head around it I can't

644
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,520
wrap my head around that all right no uh

645
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:20,520
no pun intended and you know and the

646
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,000
bottom line is is that when people do

647
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,799
eat brains in different countries

648
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,240
including here and you know like rabbit

649
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,640
brain that's that's pretty common here

650
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,880
rabbit brain that there's a lot of

651
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,760
people eating in the US they're eating

652
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,399
you know they eat the the brain out of

653
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,399
the rabbit they have the rabbit stewing

654
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,919
in a stew you know afterwards you just

655
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,000
you know kind of crack the head open a

656
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,640
little bit and they take the rabbit

657
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,440
brain I'm just I'm just telling you guys

658
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,440
it's very common in the US it's it's a

659
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,559
staple in a lot of different communities

660
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,399
here's the

661
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:55,240
deal um the brain is sweet it's sweet

662
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:57,320
like a sugar pudding it's sweet because

663
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,000
it's got so much carbohydrate in there

664
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,080
so so let's go into the carbohydrate

665
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,799
thing carbohydrate is a conductor for

666
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,679
mineral salts conductor for mineral

667
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,279
salts mineral salts sodium chloride you

668
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,559
know potassium magnesium all these

669
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,360
different mineral salts and um and and

670
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,240
those sugars in the brain the glycogen

671
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,919
that's a conductor so that these mineral

672
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,840
salts become a neuron a neurotransmitter

673
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,360
sorry so they become a

674
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,960
neurotransmitter and that

675
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,960
neurotransmitter is a chemical that sits

676
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,640
on a neuron so we can think and function

677
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,200
and get stressed out and work hard and

678
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,640
play hard and do whatever we got to

679
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,200
do and so that's just so you know the

680
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,600
background a little bit when you have

681
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,559
heavy metals in the brain they interfere

682
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,960
with electrical impulses running down in

683
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,559
neurons so you got you have to

684
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,080
understand you have this neuron and you

685
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,960
got electrical impulse that needs to get

686
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,039
to one end to the neuron to the other so

687
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,840
we can communicate so we can talk so we

688
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,559
can function and as that electrical

689
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,480
impulse is driving down that neuron it

690
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,840
needs that neurochemical that

691
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,960
neurotransmitter chemical potassium

692
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:12,240
sodium chloride magnesium it needs those

693
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,919
to run and be and just to run that

694
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,640
electrical impulse across the neuron and

695
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,880
then if you're loaded with heavy metals

696
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,559
Mercury cadmiun lead if you you know

697
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,679
where Mercury for sure aluminum they

698
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,519
deflect they get in the way they they

699
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,519
they D down the flame of of the uh the

700
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,159
neurotransmitter they die down the flame

701
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,640
of the electrical impulse running you

702
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:36,760
know running running down the neuron

703
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,360
using the neurotransmitter to do so and

704
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,120
it just it dieses out the flame so we

705
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,799
got to get the heavy metals out of there

706
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,760
and heavy metals oxidize into the brain

707
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,720
and they end up bleeding into the brain

708
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,200
meaning that they oxidize and run off

709
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,880
like a river polluting the

710
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,480
brain and so we have to clean out the

711
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,159
metals out of the brain that's number

712
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,799
one got to clean out the old the old

713
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:05,240
glutamate not glutamine glutamate the

714
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,000
MSG um lots of MSG in the brain we have

715
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,640
in many different people pockets of it

716
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,640
in different places we need to clear

717
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,120
that out as well aspiran got to get the

718
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,440
aspiran out of the

719
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,200
brain and that's important and all this

720
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,640
is critical and then we got to make sure

721
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,679
our brain is healthy with enough

722
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,440
glycogen so we need the right foods and

723
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm going to talk about that and we need

724
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,840
to get rid of the wrong foods to get our

725
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,919
brains healthy

726
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,279
healthier see all this is important and

727
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,799
we're going to cover some supplements

728
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:39,000
too about how you know what's good for

729
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,120
the brain so the goal is that under

730
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,279
stress we need a carbohydrate if we're

731
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,640
under

732
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:50,440
stress the carbohydrate and eating when

733
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,799
we're under stress stops our adrenaline

734
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,840
from dissolving our

735
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:57,880
brains what happens is adrenaline

736
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,039
becomes

737
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,720
one of the most toxic substances to us

738
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,200
that destroys our brain health so this

739
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,799
shows about brain health and I'm going

740
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
to tell you one of the one of the most

741
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,039
toxic substances is our own adrenaline

742
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:17,080
being triggered off by crap happening in

743
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:20,840
our lives you know like bad news and you

744
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:23,120
know you name it and the shock of bad

745
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,120
news why do you think we say Hey you

746
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,559
have to sit down for this list listen

747
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,360
listen Mack I think you're gonna have to

748
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,760
sit down because I got to tell you

749
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,399
something I gotta break break some news

750
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,760
to you because if you're standing up

751
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,799
you're going to have an electrical shock

752
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,399
so hard in the brain that you might pass

753
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:44,480
out or you might just fall backwards so

754
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,799
we might have to just have you sit

755
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,760
down I always find it doesn't work to

756
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,679
get bad news delivered to you sitting

757
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,399
down I I I would rather

758
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,639
Pace with bad news coming to me I'd

759
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:59,279
rather be moving a little bit um but

760
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,720
there's a reason why we tell people to

761
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,080
sit down there's an electrical shock

762
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,639
it's magnified when it gets handed to us

763
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,639
like this when we get stressed or bad

764
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:10,799
news or we're under the gun and then our

765
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:13,600
adrenaline floods if you're not eating

766
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,559
enough carbohydrate during that day or

767
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,880
every hour and a half or two hours your

768
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,559
adrenaline will just go into the brain

769
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,799
and start saturating it and pickling it

770
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,159
pickling it like it was in

771
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,000
vinegar and and this is what we're up

772
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:30,519
against it's

773
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,320
basically a technique it's a way we you

774
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,760
know we we survive it's fight or flight

775
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,360
but when we're under fight or flight so

776
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,840
much we have to be cautious and Cal it

777
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,559
down and make sure we have enough of

778
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,360
those good carbohydrates to stop us from

779
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:47,880
fight or flight meaning it stops the

780
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,919
Damage Done by the adrenaline it Shields

781
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,120
the

782
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:54,320
adrenaline and it's also why naturally

783
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,600
you know you go look you know you take

784
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,320
your child to the doctor's office and

785
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,600
they got lollipop sitting there after

786
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,440
after your child had you know um you

787
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,919
know a look after the doctor looked down

788
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,799
your child's throat and told your your

789
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,600
child to say ah it was kind of a scary

790
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,440
experience so then you know your child

791
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,880
you know it's you need a lollipop at the

792
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,600
end or or Mom will take the child to to

793
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,399
get some ice cream afterwards after a

794
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,360
doctor's visit that happens a lot

795
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,480
because those are not good forms of

796
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,840
sugar but it's to kind of take that

797
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,799
shock of whatever adrenaline was kind of

798
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,519
running from being

799
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,159
scared and so

800
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,080
glucose is what we need to protect

801
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,320
ourselves in a stressful world that we

802
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,760
live in today but it's not just

803
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,760
protecting ourselves it's protecting our

804
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,559
brains and the 21st century we're

805
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,760
getting some serious brain rot it is

806
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,320
evident it is rampant it is out of

807
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,360
control protein does not keep our brain

808
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,080
healthy and protein does

809
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,240
not make our brain stay

810
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,760
strong um that that's very important to

811
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,480
understand just so you know I'm not

812
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,440
anti-protein we need our protein from

813
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,559
lots of fruits and vegetables you know

814
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,399
there's other protein sources people get

815
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:11,080
it from you know high quality animal

816
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:13,559
products but the goal is the goal is is

817
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,279
that we can't do the carb free thing we

818
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,320
can't go that route we have to have a

819
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,120
lot of fresh fruits in our diet and I

820
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,679
want to go into that now

821
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,279
antioxidants stops your brain from dying

822
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,799
it's antioxidants so phytochemicals it's

823
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,240
the phytochemical antioxidant family and

824
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,679
especially the one that's not even

825
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,840
discovered by science that I talk about

826
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,360
in life-changing Foods they keep your

827
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,679
brain from dying that's what

828
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,039
antioxidants do they stop the dying

829
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,960
process highest forms of antioxidants

830
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:52,159
are in the fruit group so don't be

831
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,559
afraid of eating an apple an apple is

832
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,240
anti-inflammatory for the

833
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,200
brain TI in antioxidants but it's ant

834
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,679
anti-inflammatory and it's not a white

835
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,480
food just because the skin is remember

836
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
the skin is red you open an apple it's

837
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,359
white inside that's where the people who

838
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,320
pick on potatoes got it all wrong okay

839
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,800
then maybe call an apple a white food

840
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,079
then you you see what I'm saying you

841
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,359
guys another piece of you know you can

842
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,320
you can really do your own you know your

843
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,280
breakdown on some of these Trends and

844
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,040
some of these fads you could even just

845
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,000
you know learn how to break them apart

846
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,599
yourself because they're that

847
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,879
ridiculous so anyway an Apple's not a

848
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:34,480
white food yes it's powerful and that's

849
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,720
what we need to be helping that's a

850
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,440
brain

851
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,119
food so the goal is lots of antioxidants

852
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,119
for the brain you do the heavy metal

853
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,040
detox for the brain the

854
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,720
spirulina the cilantro the barley grass

855
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,200
juice powder and you guys know my

856
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,040
favorite I have it listed on my um you

857
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,079
know it's on my website if you want to

858
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,640
look I mean there's one there and

859
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,520
that'll take you to a place to get it

860
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,960
and so the barley grass juice powder and

861
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:07,320
the dols the cilantro it's that whole

862
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,480
team to get the metals out of the brain

863
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,480
and and that team also does have

864
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,160
phytochemicals in it that that that help

865
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,079
with mineral salts help with

866
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,480
neurotransmitters but that's the team

867
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,800
there and then you want lots of fresh

868
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,480
fruit in your diet I'm not talking about

869
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
you don't have to eat just just fruit if

870
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,200
you don't want to that's fine you just

871
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,599
have to have it in there you can't H not

872
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,960
have your berries got to have your

873
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,640
blackberries your raspberries when's the

874
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,760
last time you had blackberries I want to

875
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,760
know I want to know the last time you

876
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,720
had

877
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,119
blackberries and so you know we need

878
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:44,800
these you got your apples oranges

879
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:46,800
calcium from oranges supports the brain

880
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
supports the nervous system supports the

881
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,319
brain so

882
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,000
calcium that's that's a that's another

883
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,560
one that's actually a neurotransmitter

884
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,480
chemical believe it or not it's not

885
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,119
listed as one but it is it's in the

886
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,079
family meaning it helps support that so

887
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,400
get that from oranges best source of

888
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,000
calorie you know best source of of you

889
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,079
know calcium and it's also a great

890
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,240
caloric food for the brain um so these

891
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
are some of the things we're talking

892
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,200
about what we can do to protect our

893
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,359
brain in every way

894
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,040
possible let's go into some different

895
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,280
stuff we'll go into some foods wild

brain healthy so it doesn't shrink and

899
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,800
it doesn't swell

900
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,319

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,400
and you know and I'm not talking about

910
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,319
one stick of celery in a green juice

911
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,319
with other you know greens I do like

912
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,720
green juices of all kinds but those are

913
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:01,280
for those are for kind of Maintenance

914
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,720
celeries a

915
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,520
medicine medicine especially for in the

916
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,440
world of brain health today in the world

917
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,040
of brain problems and what's happening

918
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,240
in in with with what's going on with our

919
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,560
brains celery has undiscovered mineral

920
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,839
salt

921
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,520
compositions and and a type of mineral

922
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,440
salt that science hasn't even touched

923
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,200
upon yet because there no one's even

924
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,680
looking there and I talk about it in

925
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,280
life-changing Foods celery juice is

926
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,599
amazing for brain health you can't get

927
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:36,040
away from it it's that good cucumber and

928
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,640
cucumber juices they help with DDT heavy

929
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,720
metals pesticides radiation in the brain

930
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,400
you know cucumbers tend to help calm the

931
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,680
brain down and make it kind of an Avenue

932
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,599
so things can leave the brain easier so

933
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,160
when you're doing your heavy metal detox

934
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,880
you got your cucumber juice and you got

935
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,359
or your cucumbers and your salads every

936
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,359
day now here's the deal if there's

937
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,280
something you think you got going on

938
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,800
and you think you got a problem and you

939
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,000
think you got something and you think

940
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,079
you got your handle on it and you you

941
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
know what food to use you got to use a

942
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:10,280
decent amount of the food you can't just

943
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,680
have a cucumber once a week if if you

944
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,720
think you got something you know

945
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,160
happening and you want to eat some wild

946
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,920
blueberries you can't just eat them once

947
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,160
a month although it will still help you

948
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,800
and will still protect you but for

949
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,480
getting better you want those wild

950
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,960
blueberries every day you want a celery

951
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,119
juice every day if you're really

952
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,280
thinking you got something that you're

953
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,359
challenged with something that's in your

954
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,880
way something that you're having a

955
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,079
difficulty with with your health you

956
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,440
want to make sure you got these things

957
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,440
going on leafy

958
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,560
greens leafy greens

959
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,160
incredible for the

960
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,079
brain spinach lettuces butterleaf

961
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,839
lettuce has a

962
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,400
rare aega oil in it that goes to the

963
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,480
brain remember I told you there's still

964
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,920
a percentage I'm not saying that the

965
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,640
Omega-3s and I'm not saying the DHA

966
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,640
Omega-3s and and and fats aren't in the

967
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,760
brain I just told you it's a smaller

968
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,960
percentage it's much smaller it's not as

969
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,400
important as the carbo carbohydrate

970
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:18,880
factor that it's not as important okay

971
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,599
that means that we do need that Omega-3

972
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,280
for the brain but it's not a deal

973
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,960
breaker people can live long enough

974
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,839
without it you take away the

975
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,839
carbohydrates out of the brain people

976
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,240
die pretty fast it's a deal breaker you

977
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:35,920
see the difference that's what I'm

978
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,200
trying to say all right um so and you

979
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,280
can search for all the brain books you

980
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,839
want out there and you're just like

981
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,400
antiquate it antiquate it antiquate it

982
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,800
antiquate it you're just going to you

983
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,160
can go through all the ones you want if

984
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,760
it doesn't have this information in it

985
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,480
and uh I'm just saying that so you're

986
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,040

there's no time for you know whatever we

997
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,960
just got to get the right information

998
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:19,240
now because it's that important it it

999
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,240
matters it so matters Arta chokes Arta

1000
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,880
chokes incredible for the liver which

1001
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,280
helps the brain cuz the liver gets

1002
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,319
clogged up with Epstein bar toxins gets

1003
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
clogged up with heavy metal it gets

1004
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,160
clogged up and when the liver gets

1005
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,319
clogged up and we're in trouble because

1006
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,760
it's just just it just releases it all

1007
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:40,160
in the bloodstream everywhere it

1008
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,800
releases it all in the bloodstream and

1009
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,200
when it does it gets to the brain and it

1010
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,480
cause causes brain fog memory loss all

1011
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,359
those neurotoxins from Epstein bar and

1012
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,240
different viruses and different bugs it

1013
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,720
all gets into the brain causes brain fog

1014
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,240
confusion so you want to get your arch

1015
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,920
chokes it helps with that helps with the

1016
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,319
liver parsley another great one parsley

1017
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,640
helps remove toxins like MSG and other

1018
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:09,599
types of toxins and pesticides and and

1019
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,520
you know the whole bit it helps remove

1020
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,920
that so we like partially for the brain

1021
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:19,040
it's what it is is it hitches a ride to

1022
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,079
the the Fab Five you know it hitches a

1023
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,800
ride to the sparina cilantro to the

1024
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:25,640
barley grass to the DOL to um you know

1025
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,920
the wild blueberries partially kind of

1026
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,200
you know what it helps it helps walnuts

1027
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,040
now try not to get thrown by that whole

1028
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,119
thing where the Walnut shaped like a

1029
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,119
brain so then it's good for your brain

1030
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
try not to kind of get thrown by that

1031
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,560
because there's better things for your

1032
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,680
brain and they're not shaped like a

1033
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,000
brain the wild blueberry is the most

1034
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,680
powerful food on the planet for the

1035
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,040
brain is it shaped like a brain no it's

1036
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:49,440
not shaped like a brain it's shaped like

1037
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,599
a wild blueberry all right so I I I

1038
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,839
realize that there's information out

1039
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,760
there that we kind of get we could get

1040
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:56,800
sucked into like oh yeah wait a minute

1041
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,079
the walnuts looks like a braak brain

1042
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,400
okay that's a brain the Tomato looks

1043
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:03,640
like a heart that's a heart doesn't work

1044
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,000
like that the most powerful brain food

1045
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,880
there is in existence right now is the

1046
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,200
wild blueberry hands down can't touch it

1047
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,240
it's not shaped like a brain okay just

1048
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,280
you know I know I'm being sarcastic but

1049
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,440
it's because you got to make sure you

1050
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,319
know what's best it's so important right

1051
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,760
now in our life in our world today I

1052
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,680
can't express it enough and I like to

1053
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,280
joke around a little bit too I know I

1054
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,440
know so

1055
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,440
but the wild blueberry seriously but

1056
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,319
walnuts are good for the brain they

1057
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,800
really are they are because they do have

1058
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:37,319
that omega-3 that is that one little

1059
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,480
part that one little portion that does

1060
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:41,520
help the brain and help protect us like

1061
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,200
I said though it's not a deal breaker

1062
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,119
but I want some walnuts in your diet hem

1063
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,400
seeds same reason is a hem seed first of

1064
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,319
all hem seeds are better for your brain

1065
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,280
than Walnut are hem seeds shaped like a

1066
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,599
brain I want to know all right so you

1067
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,800
know hemp seeds are really good so

1068
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,359
that's a great one tum turmeric that's

1069
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,280
good for the brain helps the body

1070
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:02,079
cleanse helps the body detox supports

1071
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,359
the liver supports the pancreas a little

1072
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,200
bit of turmeric is wonderful

1073
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:10,960
coconut

1074
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:13,800
coconut coconut water coconut water

1075
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,319
coconut that's great you know coconut

1076
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,079
meat young coconut meat you know you

1077
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,319
know coconut butter okay it it it's

1078
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,839
actually good for the brain one reason

1079
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:28,599
why it's good for the brain is because

1080
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:33,559
it's it actually knocks down viral loads

1081
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,520
so it knocks down um Epstein bar in the

1082
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:37,040
liver knocks it down a little bit so

1083
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,280
coconut should be in the diet one way or

1084
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,240
another it knocks down that and that's

1085
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,319
why people start feeling a little bit

1086
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,760
better with brain problems it's not the

1087
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:48,240
