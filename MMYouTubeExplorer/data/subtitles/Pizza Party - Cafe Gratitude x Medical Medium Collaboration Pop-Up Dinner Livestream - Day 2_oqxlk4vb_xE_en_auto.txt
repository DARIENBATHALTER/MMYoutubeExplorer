[426.48 - 430.00] what an amazing collaboration between
[428.28 - 431.68] Cafe Gratitude and medical medium what
[430.00 - 433.88] are you most excited about with this
[431.68 - 436.52] collaboration well we actually came here
[433.88 - 439.40] for breakfast this morning also and so I
[436.52 - 442.40] had his smoothie and what I'm excited
[439.40 - 444.28] about because the menu you can choose
[442.40 - 447.36] things that I don't have to think about
[444.28 - 451.08] I don't have to go well is there egg in
[447.36 - 453.72] this is there Che in this it's I can
[451.08 - 457.20] just go eeny meeny miny mo and pick six
[453.72 - 458.84] things on the menu and I'm good do you
[457.20 - 460.32] love that you can come to a place and
[458.84 - 462.92] also be surrounded by people that
[460.32 - 465.84] support your healing Journey absolutely
[462.92 - 468.80] because again in in our world that we
[465.84 - 472.64] live and everybody has a right to their
[468.80 - 475.92] own choices of what their journey is but
[472.64 - 477.84] we are very special community and our
[475.92 - 479.68] journey is different than others and
[477.84 - 481.28] we're choosing a different path and so
[479.68 - 483.44] sometimes when you choose a different
[481.28 - 485.40] path than everybody else it's a little
[483.44 - 487.88] bit harder you get a little push back
[485.40 - 489.92] yes yes that's true what is one piece of
[487.88 - 491.72] information from medical medium that
[489.92 - 494.16] stands out to you that really helped you
[491.72 - 497.08] with your healing Journey well you know
[494.16 - 499.72] I honestly do the lemon water and then I
[497.08 - 503.32] do the celery juice and this is
[499.72 - 505.64] difficult is not having fat before noon
[503.32 - 509.60] pretty much so you're like okay what do
[505.64 - 512.08] I eat but I think it makes a huge
[509.60 - 514.56] difference to be able to cleanse your
[512.08 - 517.60] liver and give it time to cleanse
[514.56 - 520.16] because your body is meant to heal food
[517.60 - 523.20] is medicine though some don't believe
[520.16 - 525.52] that and I love the medicine that he
[523.20 - 526.84] imparts to all of us yes do you have any
[525.52 - 528.04] encouraging message you would like to
[526.84 - 531.40] share with those who are going through
[528.04 - 534.24] their healing Journey you know it's one
[531.40 - 537.64] step at a time one day at a time and I
[534.24 - 540.04] believe in manifestation if you believe
[537.64 - 541.76] I believe as my father May he rest in
[540.04 - 544.36] peace you can do anything you put your
[541.76 - 546.76] mind to yes yeah those are beautiful
[544.36 - 550.00] words and you're also quite artistic
[546.76 - 552.52] with the painting did you find uh that
[550.00 - 554.64] your artistic side and spiritual side
[552.52 - 556.44] kind of you had learned some lessons in
[554.64 - 559.44] those areas as well as when you're doing
[556.44 - 562.04] your healing Journey well I can give you
[559.44 - 563.88] this angels have always shown up in my
[562.04 - 566.76] paintings and it's I just left them
[563.88 - 570.24] there like okay fine whatever but when I
[566.76 - 574.12] connected with medical medium and
[570.24 - 576.04] company I started feeling like I was
[574.12 - 578.68] painting angels to make a difference in
[576.04 - 581.56] people's lives and I do pay it forward
[578.68 - 583.24] like here a lot with my angels yeah wow

[844.04 - 847.72] beautiful beautiful so how did you
[845.76 - 850.32] discover the medical medium information
[847.72 - 852.44] well it's a long story but essentially
[850.32 - 854.12] I'm a nurse 40 years I had been a nurse
[852.44 - 855.68] and I had gotten very sick and of course
[854.12 - 858.64] went the whole medical route trying to
[855.68 - 861.20] get well um I got covid I ended up in
[858.64 - 862.88] bed and I just knew I could fix this and
[861.20 - 865.28] they kept saying I couldn't and I kept
[862.88 - 868.00] putting me on more pills and I was not
[865.28 - 870.12] buying it I just knew food was medicine
[868.00 - 872.16] and somehow I found this Epstein bar
[870.12 - 874.44] which I knew my tighters were high and
[872.16 - 876.84] there he was I Googled it and found
[874.44 - 878.52] medical medium uh bought bought every
[876.84 - 882.88] book I have all of them except for the
[878.52 - 885.56] brain Sabers but um took a couple years
[882.88 - 887.16] uh so how did you how did you first
[885.56 - 889.04] start that healing Journey what did you
[887.16 - 890.80] start with was it the celery juice the
[889.04 - 893.40] detox smoothie I started right in all
[890.80 - 895.92] the way celery juice detox smoothie I
[893.40 - 898.52] eliminated all the fats um it took a
[895.92 - 900.68] while for some some fats like nuts and
[898.52 - 904.20] stuff to leave leave my diet but it it
[900.68 - 907.32] was a process and it all was it's but it
[904.20 - 909.88] took a good year before I started me
[907.32 - 912.24] things started to get better but I also
[909.88 - 913.88] got really sick too while I was detoxing
[912.24 - 915.92] because I was pretty sick that's
[913.88 - 917.48] interesting because some people say it
[915.92 - 919.48] happens you know they'll feel it within
[917.48 - 921.40] a week and that's great for you to share
[919.48 - 922.88] that it took time for you for people who
[921.40 - 924.92] are on their healing journey and trying
[922.88 - 927.00] this stick with it right yes no I got
[924.92 - 930.20] sicker before I got better for sure I
[927.00 - 931.72] was swollen I couldn't walk uh yeah it
[930.20 - 933.52] was hard and it was really hard to get
[931.72 - 935.96] up and do it and do that celery juice
[933.52 - 938.24] and do those do those protocols but I
[935.96 - 940.60] believed in that food was medicine yeah
[938.24 - 941.96] food was medicine and proof is I'm here
[940.60 - 944.88] I went to the book signing and I was
[941.96 - 947.52] still pretty sick then and uh it's taken
[944.88 - 949.88] this I'm really starting to feel good
[947.52 - 951.68] now oh amazing so what are some of the
[949.88 - 953.96] health benefits that you felt now that
[951.68 - 959.56] you're that you're feeling this
[953.96 - 961.28] way uh energy Joy uh I can don't have
[959.56 - 963.08] the pain that I used to have I had such
[961.28 - 965.32] bad fibromyalgia pain I couldn't even
[963.08 - 967.08] hold my head up from the pillow I ended
[965.32 - 970.72] up at a pain clinic you know on
[967.08 - 972.12] medications and uh slowly but surely

[1028.92 - 1032.68] that have done this this is I mean
[1031.08 - 1034.12] there's nothing like it there's nothing
[1032.68 - 1036.00] like it and being a nurse a critical
[1034.12 - 1037.24] care nurse for 40 years you know I
[1036.00 - 1039.32] always took care of myself because I
[1037.24 - 1041.60] never wanted to be one of those people
[1039.32 - 1043.72] and I was one of those people I was so
[1041.60 - 1045.20] sick and I I didn't understand what had
[1043.72 - 1047.28] happened and then to have doctors just
[1045.20 - 1049.24] say good luck with that good luck here
[1047.28 - 1051.76] you know you're depressed you know you
[1049.24 - 1053.56] need this or you need that and just it
[1051.76 - 1055.56] blew my mind that even these were my
[1053.56 - 1059.88] friends doctors I had worked with for 40
[1055.56 - 1061.80] years yeah nope so so in having healed
[1059.88 - 1063.08] this way with food and having tried
[1061.80 - 1065.76] doctors and then coming to the medical
[1063.08 - 1068.48] media protocol how does that affect you
[1065.76 - 1070.36] with your nursing and I had well first
[1068.48 - 1073.00] of all I had to quit nursing so first of
[1070.36 - 1075.76] all I quit uh second of all I've decided
[1073.00 - 1077.44] that I am going to do me I've taken care
[1075.76 - 1079.96] of people all my life and I've took care
[1077.44 - 1084.68] of family members and a lot of people
[1079.96 - 1086.60] and now it's me so that's really me yeah
[1084.68 - 1088.32] I'm nursing me if they want my inner
[1086.60 - 1090.36] help they have to understand who where
[1088.32 - 1094.04] I'm coming from now because I'm not
[1090.36 - 1096.48] going to say go see a doctor I'm not
[1094.04 - 1098.36] there anymore I I hope someday to say I
[1096.48 - 1100.92] I don't have to go see a doctor ever
[1098.36 - 1104.48] again I'm still working on some things
[1100.92 - 1107.24] but yeah no it's I just don't it's it
[1104.48 - 1109.28] blows my mind that that's what I did and
[1107.24 - 1110.68] I self-educated and I always believed in
[1109.28 - 1114.12] what I did
[1110.68 - 1115.80] and it's not it's not there I don't I
[1114.12 - 1117.56] don't feel that way anymore you're on on
[1115.80 - 1118.80] a different path now but do you have any
[1117.56 - 1121.96] encouraging words you would like to
[1118.80 - 1124.68] share with the community watching I just
[1121.96 - 1126.52] faith and believing and sticking to it
[1124.68 - 1130.00] um for some people it gets worse before

[1241.88 - 1247.28] and how long have you been using it for
[1243.92 - 1250.28] um I discovered it 6 years ago um I was
[1247.28 - 1251.96] really sick um I knew I needed answers I
[1250.28 - 1254.16] was trying a lot of different natural
[1251.96 - 1255.80] remedies but nothing was really working
[1254.16 - 1257.12] but I had a lot of faith that there was
[1255.80 - 1259.88] something out there that would help me
[1257.12 - 1262.00] heal and um I really feel like I was
[1259.88 - 1264.60] guided spiritually to this information
[1262.00 - 1266.60] and um when I read the first book I it
[1264.60 - 1268.76] just clicked I knew that it was what I
[1266.60 - 1271.36] had been praying for and hoping for so
[1268.76 - 1272.48] yeah wow did you have uh experienc
[1271.36 - 1275.24] health benefits from using the
[1272.48 - 1277.44] information oh yeah definitely I was um

[1293.40 - 1297.92] everything else so yeah it's been
[1295.44 - 1299.04] amazing and that's incredible what's one
[1297.92 - 1301.68] of your favorite things about the
[1299.04 - 1305.08] medical medium information um that it
[1301.68 - 1307.40] comes from above uh that it's grounded
[1305.08 - 1310.84] spirituality um that it's you know the
[1307.40 - 1313.56] physical and the spiritual um and I love
[1310.84 - 1316.16] the nature meditations but yeah just
[1313.56 - 1317.72] that it's both spiritual and physical a
[1316.16 - 1319.68] lot of people talk about their healing
[1317.72 - 1321.24] journey and that it also is quite
[1319.68 - 1323.60] spiritual did you learn any spiritual
[1321.24 - 1326.36] lessons along the way oh definitely um
[1323.60 - 1329.36] to keep a light heart is a huge one I

[1484.12 - 1487.48] them
[1484.88 - 1489.16] again so nice how did you come across
[1487.48 - 1492.00] medical medium
[1489.16 - 1495.92] information my story started in
[1492.00 - 1498.40] 2014 I've listened to his uh interview
[1495.92 - 1500.84] on uh pled pure nation and also on
[1498.40 - 1503.52] mastering diabetes and at that time I
[1500.84 - 1507.20] was vegan and I thought you know hm
[1503.52 - 1510.36] medium I didn't really I wasn't sure uh
[1507.20 - 1512.72] but I uh tuned into hey house radio and
[1510.36 - 1515.80] I started listening to his podcast his
[1512.72 - 1517.96] radio shows and so I started learning
[1515.80 - 1519.76] and I enjoyed it I started kind of
[1517.96 - 1521.76] picking few things off of his
[1519.76 - 1523.96] information hoping I could get that
[1521.76 - 1526.88] phone call with him I called every
[1523.96 - 1530.72] Monday but I wasn't uh lucky enough but
[1526.88 - 1532.16] I also signed up at his page for the um
[1530.72 - 1534.32] um
[1532.16 - 1536.84] practitioners on his website back then
[1534.32 - 1539.52] in 2015 16 on his website there was a
[1536.84 - 1541.92] link for practitioners uh but I know the
[1539.52 - 1544.44] line is long so I'm still hoping to get
[1541.92 - 1547.60] that if he's still doing it uh to be
[1544.44 - 1551.40] able to learn how I can um improve my
[1547.60 - 1552.80] skills to help my clients so and what
[1551.40 - 1555.04] are some of the symptoms and conditions
[1552.80 - 1557.48] you've healed using medical medium
[1555.04 - 1560.00] information a lot of neurological
[1557.48 - 1562.16] conditions and uh right now I'm still
[1560.00 - 1565.36] working on fragrance sensitivity and
[1562.16 - 1567.32] chemical sensitivity because once the
[1565.36 - 1570.16] bug came to town I was so compromised I
[1567.32 - 1571.76] lost sense of smell and I was getting so
[1570.16 - 1573.68] sick but I didn't know what was causing
[1571.76 - 1575.52] it until about 8 months later when my
[1573.68 - 1578.12] smell came back and I realized every
[1575.52 - 1579.88] time I smell perfume cologne every time
[1578.12 - 1582.44] I got exposed to any kind of a bleach
[1579.88 - 1584.44] smell ammonia smell I was being so
[1582.44 - 1586.96] compromised I would cancel the work next
[1584.44 - 1589.80] day because I was just sleeping I was
[1586.96 - 1592.84] nauseated I was tired would get bloated
[1589.80 - 1594.92] and so I started uh doing a lot of
[1592.84 - 1596.68] advanced heavy metal detox movie and a
[1594.92 - 1600.76] lot of advanced extractors movie which
[1596.68 - 1602.84] helps greatly I'm still not 100% healed
[1600.76 - 1605.76] from it but I can walk into a shoe store
[1602.84 - 1609.36] without wearing a VCC respirator so
[1605.76 - 1612.08] that's a big step and just last night um
[1609.36 - 1614.72] when I went back to my hotel room I was
[1612.08 - 1619.24] going to sleep and I realized the Linens
[1614.72 - 1621.64] were heavily um smelling as a bleach so
[1619.24 - 1623.48] I thought this is not good but I didn't
[1621.64 - 1625.76] know how bad it was until the morning
[1623.48 - 1629.72] when I woke up with my face swollen
[1625.76 - 1631.96] buffed eyes um runny nose I was tearing
[1629.72 - 1635.36] just one side of one one of my eyes were
[1631.96 - 1637.40] just constantly tearing and um I came

[3954.92 - 3957.92] since I'm from Europe they said like
[3956.24 - 3961.28] it's too far away so we should find
[3957.92 - 3963.60] someone more close by I understand I

[3963.60 - 3967.68] keep on working on it always just keep
[3965.32 - 3970.60] on you'll find somebody that might that
[3967.68 - 3972.64] may understand close by which you remove

[5415.88 - 5420.24] butter being
[5417.12 - 5422.88] bad if it was me personally and canola
[5420.24 - 5424.56] is bad if there was a little bit of
[5422.88 - 5426.44] canola in something
[5424.56 - 5428.28] and a little bit of butter and something
[5426.44 - 5431.36] I would eat the little bit of canola and
[5428.28 - 5433.24] something I'm just saying and and and
[5431.36 - 5435.56] that's not to say I'm eating canola cuz
[5433.24 - 5438.32] I'm not but yeah but yeah I don't like
[5435.56 - 5441.32] either or and then can I have my second
[5438.32 - 5442.72] question yeah yeah okay I'm in a mommy
[5441.32 - 5444.88] medical medium group and then we were

[5464.64 - 5469.24] good for you right well you know what it
[5467.00 - 5470.80] is is just people are doing so much fat
[5469.24 - 5472.84] okay they're just they're killing their
[5470.80 - 5475.76] livers and then in the end they're just
[5472.84 - 5478.12] getting sick so yeah no so if you have
[5475.76 - 5483.12] less fat or no fat um that's really good
[5478.12 - 5486.08] for you okay and but um avocados are so

[5774.72 - 5779.44] you're the coolest of the cool so are
[5776.32 - 5782.48] you okay so you know how you say that we
[5779.44 - 5784.84] don't manifest our illnesses or like
[5782.48 - 5786.28] issues and stuff correct I think I think
[5784.84 - 5788.56] the way you're saying it yes that's
[5786.28 - 5791.04] that's correct so how much of it is like
[5788.56 - 5793.84] a matrix attack how much his past lives
[5791.04 - 5795.64] or Karma we're releasing and like is a
[5793.84 - 5797.48] lot of a lot of it Matrix attacks
[5795.64 - 5800.56] because we're like really trying to
[5797.48 - 5802.68] cleanse and like you know we're our
[5800.56 - 5804.40] bodies are getting pure we're not you're
[5802.68 - 5807.24] going you're going to love the Angels
[5804.40 - 5808.72] demons and spiritual tools audio you're
[5807.24 - 5810.60] you're you're you're going to love it I
[5808.72 - 5814.28] mean the answers that come through there
[5810.60 - 5816.44] I mean I yeah you really
[5814.28 - 5818.12] okay so you're not going to tell me well
[5816.44 - 5821.08] no maybe I should talk about it more
[5818.12 - 5823.28] though cuz it's such a big answer I mean
[5821.08 - 5825.56] if I answer a piece of it it's going to
[5823.28 - 5827.68] be missing 10 pieces right now that's
[5825.56 - 5829.56] the only problem you know what I mean
[5827.68 - 5831.40] yeah it's a huge question it's like the
[5829.56 - 5833.32] meaning of life question it's like
[5831.40 - 5835.44] what's the meaning of life that's how
[5833.32 - 5837.12] big that question is so I I wouldn't
[5835.44 - 5839.08] even be able to answer it all I'd leave
[5837.12 - 5841.60] it I would leave it like I would leave
[5839.08 - 5843.84] Parts out and then and then people would
[5841.60 - 5846.36] be like wait a minute this is doesn't
[5843.84 - 5849.60] make sense what about this what about
[5846.36 - 5852.36] that okay but um but yeah it it's
[5849.60 - 5854.88] there's so much there's so much okay we
[5852.36 - 5857.40] don't create our illness right okay we
[5854.88 - 5859.68] don't we don't manifest our illness we
[5857.40 - 5863.20] don't create it okay doesn't work that
[5859.68 - 5865.20] way um but um but yeah there there's a
[5863.20 - 5867.20] lot of information the best but there's
[5865.20 - 5869.16] Matrix attacks right huh there's Matrix

[6063.96 - 6071.16] again yeah um it's just been really
[6067.28 - 6073.48] intense uh lately me I'm just I'm just
[6071.16 - 6075.68] wondering I just really need some hope
[6073.48 - 6078.20] as far as like what I should do with my
[6075.68 - 6081.00] healing and like where I should go with
[6078.20 - 6082.76] it I tried the mono cleans uh again was
[6081.00 - 6085.20] that hard to do it was hard to do I had
[6082.76 - 6087.00] I lost some weight and uh it really
[6085.20 - 6089.00] scared me are you getting enough you get
[6087.00 - 6091.40] enough calories I try to get as many
[6089.00 - 6094.04] calories as possible I don't want to
[6091.40 - 6095.92] anyone else well that's the thing about
[6094.04 - 6098.16] good thing but that's the thing about
[6095.92 - 6099.20] hard for me yeah listen it's important
[6098.16 - 6102.20] to know
[6099.20 - 6104.96] like you can eat as much as you need to
[6102.20 - 6106.72] eat there's no there's no portion thing
[6104.96 - 6109.44] there's no nothing like you make sure
[6106.72 - 6111.04] you're eating enough yeah because this
[6109.44 - 6113.32] the medical meme information is the only
[6111.04 - 6116.12] information that doesn't minimize
[6113.32 - 6118.04] portions no no every single cleanse out
[6116.12 - 6120.60] there in the world every single diet
[6118.04 - 6122.32] belief system they they restrict and
[6120.60 - 6124.04] they restrict and they restrict but
[6122.32 - 6126.56] there's no restrictions so don't hold
[6124.04 - 6128.80] back no I didn't build yourself up yeah
[6126.56 - 6132.44] I ate as much as possible but I was
[6128.80 - 6135.32] still it was still really hard what I
[6132.44 - 6137.84] mean what does Spirit say I I should
[6135.32 - 6138.96] well I mean it's like this okay you know
[6137.84 - 6140.24] you're on the right track you know

[6196.88 - 6201.28] good to see you I I I get something in
[6198.96 - 6203.72] my mind in the morning I wake up 5:00
[6201.28 - 6206.44] a.m. in the morning and I was thinking
[6203.72 - 6208.04] wait a minute this year what what is
[6206.44 - 6209.84] really happening right now this live
[6208.04 - 6211.16] stream and all the stuff it's like a
[6209.84 - 6212.92] Hollywood production and know what
[6211.16 - 6216.00] thinking this must be a high price
[6212.92 - 6218.00] ticket to come in but it's for it's for
[6216.00 - 6221.16] free for the people right they can watch
[6218.00 - 6223.00] it and I was thinking it's free how how
[6221.16 - 6226.32] many people are working here and do do
[6223.00 - 6228.00] everything for for us and I know I know
[6226.32 - 6230.32] that's what I try to do I try to keep
[6228.00 - 6232.64] everything for free and that's what I
[6230.32 - 6235.04] that's what I do because you got people
[6232.64 - 6239.08] who are ically sick and they've been
[6235.04 - 6242.40] through a lot and the industry
[6239.08 - 6244.72] is very dirty out there and all they do
[6242.40 - 6246.36] is just you know everything's a price
[6244.72 - 6248.04] everything's a price they don't care how
[6246.36 - 6250.60] sick you are what you've been through
[6248.04 - 6253.32] yes you know and the spirit of
[6250.60 - 6256.64] compassion we fight to make sure that

[8235.44 - 8240.00] quarter mile without taking a break I
[8237.44 - 8242.00] had to like sit down and wait until like

[8310.24 - 8314.36] you thank you so much I'm proud of you
[8312.84 - 8316.72] by the way I'm proud of you okay
[8314.36 - 8316.72] remember
[8318.16 - 8321.60] that got to get
[8322.76 - 8330.04] myself hi Anthony to meet you again you
[8327.44 - 8332.20] so I have a question have you ever heard
[8330.04 - 8334.00] that women are capable of stopping and
[8332.20 - 8337.32] controlling their reproductive
[8334.00 - 8339.16] system or stopping and controlling yeah
[8337.32 - 8341.24] like to stop ovulating because we only
[8339.16 - 8343.60] want to have like two kids per se and
[8341.24 - 8347.64] then our immune system drops by like 80
[8343.60 - 8349.48] to 90% so if we could stop ovulating
[8347.64 - 8351.76] when we don't want to have kids that
[8349.48 - 8356.04] could really save a woman's
[8351.76 - 8360.36] life no I know and but but the but even
[8356.04 - 8362.24] though um even though there's control or
[8360.36 - 8364.32] control control can happen to that
[8362.24 - 8368.28] degree then there's
[8364.32 - 8370.76] God and then there's um you the Angelic
[8368.28 - 8374.24] realm and there's things that happen for
[8370.76 - 8377.24] reasons we just can't we we can't
[8374.24 - 8380.80] measure and we can't understand and and
[8377.24 - 8384.40] and sometimes it just you know overrides
[8380.80 - 8386.12] a certain course and changes a direction
[8384.40 - 8389.08] and so it
[8386.12 - 8391.32] it you know nothing's guaranteed you
[8389.08 - 8394.24] know and that's the one thing
[8391.32 - 8397.16] about God and the Angelic realm and the
[8394.24 - 8399.08] spiritual realm is things happen when we
[8397.16 - 8401.04] don't even realize why they're happening
[8399.08 - 8404.20] then or not and
[8401.04 - 8407.60] so but I but I've heard I've heard of
[8404.20 - 8410.12] something like in that that belief yeah
[8407.60 - 8412.52] and um cuz when I read your book I
[8410.12 - 8414.44] prayed for one thing menopause yep you
[8412.52 - 8415.68] know and I was with a group of women
[8414.44 - 8417.20] that we were all saying yeah when we
[8415.68 - 8419.92] read his book we just prayed that we
[8417.20 - 8421.36] would have that happen sooner than later
[8419.92 - 8423.60] because our imun system is being
[8421.36 - 8425.44] destroyed by our reproductive system
[8423.60 - 8426.96] right so is God just angry at women and
[8425.44 - 8430.40] we're not going to survive the viral a
[8426.96 - 8432.00] [ __ ] this way no you know it it's it but
[8430.40 - 8434.92] there's things though you know that's
[8432.00 - 8438.04] there's tools to over overcompensate
[8434.92 - 8440.04] anything and and keep strong too so
[8438.04 - 8442.08] there's a lot of tools as well you know
[8440.04 - 8444.24] but no I understand I understand get a
[8442.08 - 8445.96] photo yeah okay very interesting it's
[8444.24 - 8451.44] it's a deep talk it's a deep talk I want
[8445.96 - 8451.44] to interview you here step forward here

[9252.52 - 9259.52] me I'm honored thank you um I would like
[9256.40 - 9261.88] to ask if you have any advice um because
[9259.52 - 9263.48] I I lost so much weight I I've been
[9261.88 - 9264.92] doing it but I lost so much weight I
[9263.48 - 9268.80] don't know if I'm doing it right I don't
[9264.92 - 9271.12] know if you have any don't don't
[9268.80 - 9274.08] um you know
[9271.12 - 9276.68] don't just are you doing 369 or are you
[9274.08 - 9280.24] doing 28 to what are you doing are you
[9276.68 - 9282.64] doing different different uh cleanses I
[9280.24 - 9286.08] think I lost weight initially to begin
[9282.64 - 9289.88] with and then I try to do the simple
[9286.08 - 9292.96] c um
[9289.88 - 9295.12] are you trying to exercise a little what
[9292.96 - 9298.04] can you do for
[9295.12 - 9299.92] exercise uh I would probably start
[9298.04 - 9302.44] walking can you're walking yeah you're
[9299.92 - 9306.20] walking and you build up a little more
[9302.44 - 9309.08] muscle to see and that brings up the
[9306.20 - 9311.56] weight so and because you're eating so
[9309.08 - 9314.48] good you should build up muscle
[9311.56 - 9316.56] fast all you have to do is move a little
[9314.48 - 9319.20] and muscle builds quick because you're
[9316.56 - 9320.64] doing all the right things you're giving
[9319.20 - 9322.88] your muscle what they need so once you
[9320.64 - 9325.28] start using them they build really quick
[9322.88 - 9327.68] and then you'll see your weight go up
[9325.28 - 9331.68] and then and also there's no there's no
[9327.68 - 9334.24] portion control so always know that cuz
[9331.68 - 9335.52] cleanses did you do anything healthy
[9334.24 - 9337.00] like try to do anything in the health
[9335.52 - 9339.52] world before

[9938.04 - 9941.04] tonight
[9947.92 - 9951.96] amazing for
[9990.28 - 9993.76] back in 2015 when I wasn't feeling well
[9992.36 - 9995.40] and had a lot of chronic illness and
[9993.76 - 9998.64] just like everybody in this community we
[9995.40 - 10000.80] come to the information desperate and uh
[9998.64 - 10002.32] we're ready at that point I was ready I
[10000.80 - 10004.72] cried when I heard Anthony the first
[10002.32 - 10006.76] time because it was so overwhelming I
[10004.72 - 10009.00] knew it was truth and it was a really
[10006.76 - 10011.12] big deal but life threw us a lot of Cur
[10009.00 - 10013.64] balls at you and it turned out that I
[10011.12 - 10016.00] went through some really really rough
[10013.64 - 10017.92] stuff in the in the course of the 9
[10016.00 - 10019.84] years when I spoke to him the first time
[10017.92 - 10022.80] he told me I needed some self-compassion
[10019.84 - 10026.04] and I actually went home and Googled it
[10022.80 - 10027.88] what is self-compassion anyway and so
[10026.04 - 10030.68] that started my journey towards
[10027.88 - 10033.28] self-compassion and and I'm here and I'm
[10030.68 - 10036.16] here and that's that's a miracle it's a
[10033.28 - 10039.64] miracle I was in a wheelchair when I
[10036.16 - 10041.36] started um very legally blind still
[10039.64 - 10044.48] still have a lot of vision problems but
[10041.36 - 10047.60] not nearly like I did um it's healing
[10044.48 - 10049.84] and brain fog depersonalization
[10047.60 - 10052.96] depression just a lot of trauma in my
[10049.84 - 10054.76] life and the information has just got me
[10052.96 - 10057.40] out of the wheelchair got me to be able
[10054.76 - 10059.92] to express myself and socialize again
[10057.40 - 10063.48] and not feel alone and just healed so
[10059.92 - 10066.04] much physical neurological pain in 20121
[10063.48 - 10067.88] I got super sick and I dropped 40 lbs in
[10066.04 - 10070.08] 30 days the doctors didn't know what's
[10067.88 - 10071.72] wrong with me and they just kept pushing
[10070.08 - 10074.28] medication on me and I would try it and
[10071.72 - 10076.28] flare and got so sick to where I wrote
[10074.28 - 10078.36] like a will out for who my children
[10076.28 - 10080.08] would go to when I died um I could not
[10078.36 - 10082.76] cook I couldn't clean I couldn't drive I
[10080.08 - 10085.52] was on mattress Island for 2 years and I
[10082.76 - 10088.72] kept seeing Anthony Williams um videos
[10085.52 - 10090.84] on Facebook oh my God and my cousin
[10088.72 - 10092.48] actually healed colon cancer from his
[10090.84 - 10093.88] protocols so I reached out to him and
[10092.48 - 10096.36] he's like it's safe it's okay to try
[10093.88 - 10098.12] that there's no way 3 years ago I'd be
[10096.36 - 10099.80] able to fly to something like this if
[10098.12 - 10102.92] you just listen listen to his words
[10099.80 - 10104.32] listen to the protocols try it your body
[10102.92 - 10105.60] will start to thrive and you'll see a
[10104.32 - 10106.80] difference that gives you the hope to

[10350.64 - 10355.12] thank you so much for everything I owe
[10352.68 - 10356.84] it all to you and spirit of compassion
[10355.12 - 10361.32] thanks for coming I'm a medical medium
[10356.84 - 10364.40] type 1 diabetic wow and I yes and I hold
[10361.32 - 10365.96] a diabetes support group so on behalf of
[10364.40 - 10367.44] the medical medium diabetic my God
[10365.96 - 10369.00] you're you're out there speaking good
[10367.44 - 10370.04] words
[10369.00 - 10373.12] there're speaking good words about
[10370.04 - 10376.08] medical me in the diabetes world yes of
[10373.12 - 10379.84] course I so I was wondering if there's
[10376.08 - 10381.56] anything you can tell us um for type 1
[10379.84 - 10383.40] diabetics based on whether it's
[10381.56 - 10384.72] reversible or not well you know and I I
[10383.40 - 10386.72] I think I've said this in the books and
[10384.72 - 10390.80] stuff like the pancreas gets injured by
[10386.72 - 10392.84] all these other things so you know think
[10390.80 - 10395.56] about that because the information's
[10392.84 - 10399.12] there it's not just about food it's
[10395.56 - 10401.72] about what caused the pancreas
[10399.12 - 10403.88] injury right like remember the pathogens
[10401.72 - 10405.56] and things like that so what do you do
[10403.88 - 10407.96] when it's pathogens and stuff like that
[10405.56 - 10410.36] you do little things to go after
[10407.96 - 10412.48] pathogens you know so there's there's
[10410.36 - 10414.48] information there so I feel like stress
[10412.48 - 10417.12] and adrenaline is one of the main things
[10414.48 - 10419.12] that injured my pancreas and but it's
[10417.12 - 10420.40] ongoing it's something I constantly am
[10419.12 - 10422.48] struggling with and it's like one of
[10420.40 - 10424.52] those things it's not it's not just like
[10422.48 - 10426.76] straight forward it's a vicious cycle
[10424.52 - 10431.76] but that's one right that's that's it's
[10426.76 - 10435.16] not the the it's not the but it's one
[10431.76 - 10437.68] okay there's lots of things that add to
[10435.16 - 10439.40] it okay and that's one of them but
[10437.68 - 10442.00] you're doing things to protect you with
[10439.40 - 10445.84] your adrenaline too remember that yeah

[10985.76 - 10993.40] okay I uh had a condition of uh kind of
[10991.24 - 10997.88] heavy brain fog for about a decade and I
[10993.40 - 11000.24] saw doctors alternative doctors uh tried
[10997.88 - 11001.72] weird things nothing was working and
[11000.24 - 11004.32] then I found the medical medium
[11001.72 - 11007.48] information and started celery juice and
[11004.32 - 11010.28] within about 3 weeks I started feeling a
[11007.48 - 11013.24] difference and within 3 months like 95%
[11010.28 - 11014.92] gone after that I was sold and um I've
[11013.24 - 11017.04] Incorporated everything into my
[11014.92 - 11019.40] lifestyle since then I end up getting
[11017.04 - 11022.12] sick basically something he calls the
[11019.40 - 11024.76] lme disease trap which lime disease is a
[11022.12 - 11027.08] trap it was supposed to be antibiotics
[11024.76 - 11029.60] bacteria which it's not it's heavy
[11027.08 - 11031.96] metals and vir is I traveled the world
[11029.60 - 11034.48] China Germany seen tons of doctors the
[11031.96 - 11037.00] same story of spending money and I read
[11034.48 - 11039.44] his book on the Lim trap and it was the
[11037.00 - 11042.00] complete opposite of the Matrix that we
[11039.44 - 11044.52] all told and you know I guess
[11042.00 - 11046.72] brainwashed with and I was like wow I
[11044.52 - 11049.48] learned the exact opposite of what it is
[11046.72 - 11052.24] up down left right black
[11049.48 - 11053.72] white and it just blew my mind and I had
[11052.24 - 11057.04] a lot of Dreams after reading that
[11053.72 - 11059.20] chapter and then you know you cry then
[11057.04 - 11060.68] you dive into the material and you start
[11059.20 - 11062.72] healing and then put as much work in as
[11060.68 - 11066.56] you can to get better the first thing
[11062.72 - 11069.48] that healed was my gums regenerated I
[11066.56 - 11071.84] had gum recession my gums grew back in
[11069.48 - 11073.60] my teeth REM mineralized I was starting

[11299.84 - 11304.04] yes um first trimester of pregnancy I
[11302.96 - 11305.84] have so many patients that are
[11304.04 - 11307.96] incredibly nauseous the minute B for
[11305.84 - 11310.20] second trimester they feel better you're

[11325.08 - 11328.00] with the nausey in the first trimester
[11326.56 - 11330.20] is that what you're saying but why does
[11328.00 - 11332.60] it always usually resolve in the second
[11330.20 - 11335.44] trimester because the because the organs
[11332.60 - 11337.24] have been pushed up enough interesting
[11335.44 - 11340.24] the first trimester the organs are all
[11337.24 - 11342.64] getting pushed and and in because it's
[11340.24 - 11345.24] like it just starts to happen like that
[11342.64 - 11347.24] it it it creates it nausea okay by
[11345.24 - 11349.76] second trimester the organs are pretty
[11347.24 - 11352.08] much they're moved enough where the
[11349.76 - 11353.68] where the vagus nerves aren't being hit
[11352.08 - 11355.48] got it anymore but at the beginning of
[11353.68 - 11358.36] the first trimester the Vegas nerves are
[11355.48 - 11360.72] being hit and it's starting to St
[11358.36 - 11364.04] but but yeah if that makes any

[11554.12 - 11558.12] some good food and I'm proud of you
[11563.92 - 11568.92] right this whole journey for me started
[11566.56 - 11570.92] from my daugh being very very sick we
[11568.92 - 11572.64] did all the regular stuff like went to
[11570.92 - 11574.44] the doctor they said it was all in her
[11572.64 - 11576.56] head tried different things nothing
[11574.44 - 11578.32] really seemed to help but then as I
[11576.56 - 11580.40] started discovering more medical medium
[11578.32 - 11582.56] information and applying more of it it
[11580.40 - 11584.32] started to help and then she hit a point
[11582.56 - 11586.64] where she had like a trigger and it got
[11584.32 - 11588.28] way worse as a mom like all you want is
[11586.64 - 11590.68] your kids to be healthy and your family
[11588.28 - 11592.92] to thrive and when you see your your
[11590.68 - 11594.32] people suffering and you don't know how
[11592.92 - 11596.24] to help them and the doctors don't know
[11594.32 - 11597.80] how to help them it's just honestly one
[11596.24 - 11599.24] of the worst feelings
[11597.80 - 11601.32] possible we reached out to a
[11599.24 - 11603.88] practitioner and worked with her and
[11601.32 - 11605.84] over the course of almost 2 years she
[11603.88 - 11610.40] went from being bed bound to now getting
[11605.84 - 11616.31] back into her life so just beyond
[11610.40 - 11616.31] [Music]
[11616.32 - 11620.92] grateful this man has changed my life
[11618.80 - 11622.84] Anthony William now I'm reading the
[11620.92 - 11624.80] books I know that I was sick for a long
[11622.84 - 11626.56] time since I was a baby my whole
[11624.80 - 11628.00] childhood basically there was always
[11626.56 - 11629.28] something wrong I'm the one with the
[11628.00 - 11630.52] allergies I'm the one that had to be
[11629.28 - 11632.84] going to the doctor all the time I'm the
[11630.52 - 11635.76] one with the acne I was on like
[11632.84 - 11637.72] medications that really messed me up and
[11635.76 - 11640.28] I never knew why I was always the sick
[11637.72 - 11642.40] one right and then I had my babies and
[11640.28 - 11644.52] then boom like my whole world crashed
[11642.40 - 11645.92] down because I got lupus it's been
[11644.52 - 11647.92] something that I've been fighting and
[11645.92 - 11649.44] looking for and I'm a biologist I study
[11647.92 - 11651.72] biology I have a master's degree in
[11649.44 - 11652.44] biology I was in biotech I couldn't find
[11651.72 - 11654.72] the
[11652.44 - 11656.56] answers and then when I found well my
[11654.72 - 11658.88] friend told me about him and he said you
[11656.56 - 11661.12] will love his book Because You Love
[11658.88 - 11663.20] angels and I had been praying I've
[11661.12 - 11665.88] always prayed to God I've always asked
[11663.20 - 11668.20] his angels to help me finally when I got
[11665.88 - 11670.28] the book and I read that one chapter on
[11668.20 - 11672.36] the Angels I'm like this is the
[11670.28 - 11674.60] information I was waiting for not the

[13835.16 - 13839.04] the table and get everyone's reactions
[13837.12 - 13841.52] so we'll start here well I love the
[13839.04 - 13844.32] sushi and I was so glad to see that
[13841.52 - 13846.44] they're using pumpkin tofu because
[13844.32 - 13848.88] people think of it as tofu it really is
[13846.44 - 13851.64] not it's made out of pumpkin seed and I
[13848.88 - 13854.48] was thrilled to see them using that as a
[13851.64 - 13856.88] delicacy yes yeah I love the
[13854.48 - 13859.60] Mediterranean pizza it was so good I
[13856.88 - 13862.12] love camada olives and pesto so it was
[13859.60 - 13866.12] so delicious yeah I loved that
[13862.12 - 13867.56] yeah I love both pizzas so much um I
[13866.12 - 13870.80] wish that I could share it with my
[13867.56 - 13873.84] family back on the East Coast um they
[13870.80 - 13875.60] were just absolutely delicious and uh I
[13873.84 - 13878.24] wish I could have this every day and I
[13875.60 - 13878.24] wish I could have
[13878.32 - 13883.72] more I'm always a fan of the sushi um
[13881.44 - 13885.48] I'm local so I come to Cafe Gratitude a
[13883.72 - 13888.68] lot and I think I ordered the sushi
[13885.48 - 13890.88] maybe like 30 times since it came out
[13888.68 - 13892.80] yeah great that you're local do you
[13890.88 - 13894.88] think that having these items on the
[13892.80 - 13896.80] menu will help your healing journey and
[13894.88 - 13899.40] be help it to be more enjoyable and a
[13896.80 - 13901.44] bit easier as well definitely because
[13899.40 - 13903.88] prior to this it's not like I was ever
[13901.44 - 13905.72] able to order a takeout or anything um
[13903.88 - 13907.72] so this is a really great option to have
[13905.72 - 13910.32] for me to feel like I'm like partaking
[13907.72 - 13912.40] in normal life while still on the
[13910.32 - 13914.56] healing journey and now they have the
[13912.40 - 13916.40] cleanse option that's available to order
[13914.56 - 13918.44] as well I think that's great because it
[13916.40 - 13920.00] makes it a little less daunting for some
[13918.44 - 13921.32] people as well and it saves a lot of
[13920.00 - 13923.84] time in the kitchen it's just very
[13921.32 - 13926.00] convenient right definitely yeah I think
[13923.84 - 13929.44] it's amazing yeah well you know what's
[13926.00 - 13932.04] coming up next are these delicious
[13929.44 - 13933.56] mouthwatering cookies oh I think we're

[14625.76 - 14628.92] that's the way that's the way I like to
[14627.12 - 14631.04] do it yeah and it's incredible we're
[14628.92 - 14632.76] just going with the flow here look last
[14631.04 - 14636.20] night you spoke about your original
[14632.76 - 14638.84] audio Angels demons and spiritual tools
[14636.20 - 14641.00] can you tell us more about it you know
[14638.84 - 14643.16] um you hear people all the time and I
[14641.00 - 14645.24] said this last night people say you know
[14643.16 - 14647.04] they talk about demons they say
[14645.24 - 14649.40] something about demons or that person's
[14647.04 - 14652.48] a demon or whatever it is you know it's
[14649.40 - 14655.60] been in the verb for centuries it's been
[14652.48 - 14659.24] in the verb of you know civilization
[14655.60 - 14660.80] here right but yet no you know it's
[14659.24 - 14662.92] really just nonsense it's just for the
[14660.80 - 14664.60] movies it's just you know what I mean
[14662.92 - 14667.56] it's just make believe but the
[14664.60 - 14669.52] information that came down might have
[14667.56 - 14672.60] you thinking a little different when you
[14669.52 - 14675.32] hear about it when you hear about like
[14672.60 - 14677.16] where the word demon really came from
[14675.32 - 14679.96] what was the word before it how did it
[14677.16 - 14682.16] start that's one thing on its own I mean
[14679.96 - 14684.28] that piece of information is just to tip
[14682.16 - 14686.88] the iceberg
[14684.28 - 14690.12] look look I'm nervous even talking about
[14686.88 - 14692.32] this audio this original audio because
[14690.12 - 14694.16] the information is so mindblowing that
[14692.32 - 14696.20] you know I'm probably going to take some
[14694.16 - 14698.44] hits for you know there's going to be
[14696.20 - 14700.96] probably some hate because you know
[14698.44 - 14702.92] people like they want a good reason to
[14700.96 - 14705.92] hate out there you know do there's a lot
[14702.92 - 14707.96] of people that want a reason to hate and
[14705.92 - 14710.08] there and there's and there's a lot of
[14707.96 - 14712.72] people that don't want that obviously
[14710.08 - 14714.44] but this information is controversial
[14712.72 - 14716.80] controversial
[14714.44 - 14718.24] that that's the difference but but
[14716.80 - 14721.68] spiritually
[14718.24 - 14723.92] controversial and it challenges belief
[14721.68 - 14726.52] systems it challenges
[14723.92 - 14728.92] religions and the one thing
[14726.52 - 14731.20] about the one thing about angels demons
[14728.92 - 14733.12] and spiritual tools the one thing about
[14731.20 - 14735.60] this interesting is that I've
[14733.12 - 14737.40] Incorporated information for my
[14735.60 - 14739.32] spiritual belief system in there so it
[14737.40 - 14741.92] doesn't matter what it doesn't matter
[14739.32 - 14744.20] what belief system what religion what

[14943.88 - 14947.52] the medical medium information now
[14946.04 - 14950.24] medical medium information has been
[14947.52 - 14953.44] leading the way for over a decade why is
[14950.24 - 14955.00] that the health movement is has been
[14953.44 - 14957.64] changed because of medical medium
[14955.00 - 14961.16] information all the way down to science
[14957.64 - 14964.48] to fake science to real science to you
[14961.16 - 14966.12] know um to the podcast world and health
[14964.48 - 14967.88] they use medical medium information they
[14966.12 - 14970.40] don't cite it they take medical medium
[14967.88 - 14972.40] information every day I mean you see it
[14970.40 - 14974.00] out there everywhere psoriasis is caused
[14972.40 - 14975.76] by Metals really there's no science that
[14974.00 - 14977.44] determines that it doesn't exist
[14975.76 - 14980.28] anywhere it's been published in medical
[14977.44 - 14981.88] medium books the sad part about that
[14980.28 - 14984.64] there there's a positive about it in a
[14981.88 - 14987.24] way and that positive is the has changed
[14984.64 - 14989.64] the shape of Health right like fruit
[14987.24 - 14991.80] fear everybody was afraid of fruit I
[14989.64 - 14995.20] don't care what anybody says 10 years
[14991.80 - 14997.52] ago everybody was fruits the devil it's
[14995.20 - 14999.44] sugar it's bad for you you can't heal
[14997.52 - 15002.16] when you're doing sugar that's what
[14999.44 - 15003.88] everybody said everybody did and if you
[15002.16 - 15005.56] don't know that you're just green and
[15003.88 - 15007.80] you just started you're just young or
[15005.56 - 15010.16] didn't know but it was like that medical
[15007.80 - 15012.72] medium fought the battles already we
[15010.16 - 15014.76] fought the wars and so that people are
[15012.72 - 15017.20] eating fruit so much so carnivore diet
[15014.76 - 15019.28] has fruit in it now keto has fruit in it
[15017.20 - 15022.12] all the time like fruits in everything
[15019.28 - 15024.04] now because of the work we did whether
[15022.12 - 15026.96] anybody likes it or not it was the work
[15024.04 - 15029.08] we did and it was it was a battle and we
[15026.96 - 15032.36] did that and it's it's changed the world
[15029.08 - 15034.56] but that's just one one thing like look
[15032.36 - 15036.20] at collagen it was like you got to eat
[15034.56 - 15038.44] collagen and that's how you build up
[15036.20 - 15041.32] your collagen medical medium information
[15038.44 - 15043.40] was like no you need the building blocks
[15041.32 - 15044.88] to build collagen and now look you hear
[15043.40 - 15046.40] it on you know there's podcasts out
[15044.88 - 15047.56] there and podcast doctors people always
[15046.40 - 15049.00] tell me like you wouldn't believe what
[15047.56 - 15053.48] this person's saying they're they took
[15049.00 - 15056.92] your info it's leading the way it has it
[15053.48 - 15058.44] still is it just it just is you know and
[15056.92 - 15060.08] that's what's incredible about it
[15058.44 - 15062.28] because Spirit compassion is leading the
[15060.08 - 15065.04] way with this and people they don't have
[15062.28 - 15067.12] to believe in spirit they don't have to
[15065.04 - 15070.32] have a spiritual belief they don't have
[15067.12 - 15073.32] to think I hear a voice or not since age
[15070.32 - 15075.80] four I have they just need to do the
[15073.32 - 15078.72] information and heal and move forward
[15075.80 - 15082.40] you know and that's okay with me but the
[15078.72 - 15085.08] the you know the sad part is is that the
[15082.40 - 15087.04] health movement has changed it is
[15085.08 - 15088.92] completely the Whole Health movement has
[15087.04 - 15091.88] altered because of medical medum
[15088.92 - 15096.84] information it's gotten into every
[15091.88 - 15098.56] aspect of of um the health world the sad
[15096.84 - 15101.00] part is that's the good part the sad
[15098.56 - 15103.28] part is people can't find their way to
[15101.00 - 15106.40] the rest of the information they hear
[15103.28 - 15109.76] tidbits here tidbits there you know bioh
[15106.40 - 15111.68] hacks and biohackers are using it you
[15109.76 - 15113.36] know what I mean but they're not they're
[15111.68 - 15115.80] not getting the rest of it because
[15113.36 - 15118.92] people aren't citing it back enough to
[15115.80 - 15121.44] say oh that came from here now you can
[15118.92 - 15124.00] heal your psoriasis that came from here
[15121.44 - 15126.88] you can heal your multiple sceris you

[15126.88 - 15132.36] you just need the rest of it it's not
[15129.16 - 15135.12] just this or this you can do all of it
[15132.36 - 15137.32] and that's a sad heart that um there's
[15135.12 - 15140.88] enough people with Integrity out there
[15137.32 - 15142.84] to say oh crap I stole that information
[15140.88 - 15145.44] to try to get some more clicks and and
[15142.84 - 15147.52] likes and more you know views but I
[15145.44 - 15148.76] don't want to say where I got it from
[15147.52 - 15151.12] and then you you got to think about
[15148.76 - 15153.16] somebody who's chronically sick yeah how
[15151.12 - 15155.68] can you have like how can you be that
[15153.16 - 15158.48] way and not just be like look to be

[15158.48 - 15163.88] books it's changed all these lives
[15161.92 - 15165.44] that's where you can find the rest of it
[15163.88 - 15168.24] yeah but people don't have that
[15165.44 - 15169.84] Integrity anymore maybe somebody does
[15168.24 - 15172.04] but not a lot when it comes down to the
[15169.84 - 15174.16] doggy dog world of Health it's it's
[15172.04 - 15176.16] pretty sad well talking about people who

[15265.44 - 15269.36] well what is the difference between
[15267.52 - 15270.88] biohacking and medical maum because you
[15269.36 - 15272.52] mentioned biohacking that's just musical
[15270.88 - 15274.36] chairs you know biohacking is musical
[15272.52 - 15275.60] chairs everybody wants a Magic Bullet
[15274.36 - 15277.52] they wanted you know they want this
[15275.60 - 15278.96] Magic Bullet and this one fish oil it
[15277.52 - 15281.24] used to be fish oil medical medium
[15278.96 - 15283.40] blasted that so bad that it was bad for
[15281.24 - 15285.28] you that that's gone now very very few
[15283.40 - 15288.12] people take fish oil supplements like
[15285.28 - 15290.44] they used to because of mm info it's
[15288.12 - 15292.60] like the biohacks oh maybe it's fish oil
[15290.44 - 15294.64] maybe it's collagen maybe it's charcoal
[15292.60 - 15296.60] maybe it's ionizer water which is
[15294.64 - 15298.28] terrible for you maybe it's this maybe
[15296.60 - 15300.80] it's that and that's how maybe it's
[15298.28 - 15303.12] Pearl powder maybe it's this it's just
[15300.80 - 15305.24] it's endless out there biohacking this
[15303.12 - 15307.36] biohacking that you know put electrodes
[15305.24 - 15309.24] on your brain and run on the treadmill
[15307.36 - 15311.40] you know why some you know like some
[15309.24 - 15313.08] neuroscientists is like oh wait a minute
[15311.40 - 15314.64] there's a little more heat on this side
[15313.08 - 15316.44] there's a little more heat on that side
[15314.64 - 15318.32] you got the answers you know here's
[15316.44 - 15320.36] longevity here's this it's just constant
[15318.32 - 15322.08] biohacking crap but when you're sick
[15320.36 - 15325.00] with chronic illness all that's
[15322.08 - 15328.68] worthless it's musical chairs around and
[15325.00 - 15330.80] around we go and then you lose time and
[15328.68 - 15332.92] so the thing is the medical M Community
[15330.80 - 15335.20] they know about this they're seasoned
[15332.92 - 15337.80] they tried everything for 10 years 15 20
[15335.20 - 15339.44] years they fought their way back and now
[15337.80 - 15341.68] they're here they found something that
[15339.44 - 15344.32] works and then they see they got eyes to
[15341.68 - 15346.36] see now they're wise they look out and
[15344.32 - 15348.24] they see all the bull and they see all
[15346.36 - 15350.76] the tricks and they see all the gimmicks
[15348.24 - 15353.60] and the ads and the advertisers and all
[15350.76 - 15356.08] of that it's all just a game and they
[15353.60 - 15358.04] feed off of the chronically ill that's
[15356.08 - 15360.72] the point too you know they feed off the
[15358.04 - 15362.76] chronically ill so it's it's scary and
[15360.72 - 15365.56] medical medum communities is is has
[15362.76 - 15367.76] Integrity it's people who care have
[15365.56 - 15369.20] compassion and they've learned they've
[15367.76 - 15371.96] learned what it's like out there they
[15369.20 - 15374.32] know about the biohacking crap and and
[15371.96 - 15376.32] they want the truth they want the truth
[15374.32 - 15378.40] maybe I don't deliver it the best maybe

[15534.48 - 15538.64] we're having so much fun eating this
[15536.80 - 15540.16] healing food and to be surrounded in
[15538.64 - 15541.80] enironment that supports people's
[15540.16 - 15543.68] healing and having fun and having a
[15541.80 - 15545.84] pizza party who could ask for anything
[15543.68 - 15547.36] more it's amazing I know I know it's
[15545.84 - 15549.68] incredible and there's so much more to
[15547.36 - 15551.76] go tonight don't go anywhere guys we got
[15549.68 - 15553.60] the lecture coming up the light blast
[15551.76 - 15555.76] it's incredible up who knows what's
[15553.60 - 15558.56] going to come out of my mouth flying out
[15555.76 - 15560.76] of it so we'll see hopefully you know
[15558.56 - 15564.80] and that's the thing though it's funny
[15560.76 - 15567.36] because um you know I I do a lot of live
[15564.80 - 15569.64] stuff I don't do a lot of video stuff
[15567.36 - 15571.52] and then the video stuff gets post it
[15569.64 - 15572.96] it's only if for some reason I couldn't
[15571.52 - 15576.00] get a live done or whatever or whatever
[15572.96 - 15578.76] it is so but I I I make this like who
[15576.00 - 15580.52] would do this maybe maybe it's a crazy
[15578.76 - 15584.48] thing to do but who would do this I just
[15580.52 - 15586.68] want people to out there see that you
[15584.48 - 15588.04] know you can heal so I want them to be
[15586.68 - 15590.04] able to be a part of this because
[15588.04 - 15592.56] someone's sitting out there and they're
[15590.04 - 15594.40] sick even if it's just one person
[15592.56 - 15595.84] they're sick and this is going to be a
[15594.40 - 15598.56] moment where they're going to be like
[15595.84 - 15601.44] you know what I I like this guy a little
[15598.56 - 15603.88] bit um look at him he's he's live right
[15601.44 - 15606.80] now I I'm going to do medical medium and
[15603.88 - 15608.84] heal and you get one person better this
[15606.80 - 15611.16] that every every person counts yeah
[15608.84 - 15612.80] every person counts but I like to do
[15611.16 - 15614.20] things live I don't care if I make
[15612.80 - 15616.24] mistake I don't care if I fall in my
[15614.20 - 15619.32] face it doesn't matter that's what I
[15616.24 - 15621.36] like doing the the lives I do normally
[15619.32 - 15624.52] all these years and that's why I like
[15621.36 - 15627.96] doing this live stream here I like you
[15624.52 - 15631.32] know it's it's it's risky I used to do
[15627.96 - 15634.72] all the podcast live MH but it's worth
[15631.32 - 15636.40] it because you want people to just know
[15634.72 - 15639.12] that your heart's in it I'm willing to
[15636.40 - 15641.44] take a risk I'm not trying to hide
[15639.12 - 15643.32] anything I might say something I might
[15641.44 - 15645.72] say a word that may not make sense for a
[15643.32 - 15647.52] minute it doesn't matter whatever it is
[15645.72 - 15649.36] it's just I'm in it with you that's the
[15647.52 - 15651.24] whole point and that's the key I'm in it
[15649.36 - 15653.48] with you I need people to know that I'm
[15651.24 - 15655.76] dedicated because I am and that's the
[15653.48 - 15656.96] key it's the dedication so yeah we're
[15655.76 - 15660.04] live right now and I'm going to be doing
[15656.96 - 15662.20] a lecture live and a light blast live
[15660.04 - 15664.36] well we know you're dedicated we feel it

[17184.44 - 17189.52] came in kicking and screaming since I
[17187.40 - 17191.40] was a child since I was younger okay
[17189.52 - 17193.44] that's what I did I came in Kicking and
[17191.40 - 17195.84] Screaming did you ever read the first

[17195.84 - 17201.24] right okay I should have put even more
[17199.60 - 17202.08] in there about how much I was Kicking
[17201.24 - 17204.40] and
[17202.08 - 17207.52] Screaming I kind of kept it out I was
[17204.40 - 17209.52] like oh no I I can't talk about that I
[17207.52 - 17212.64] can't talk about this no no do you
[17209.52 - 17216.60] remember my dog right
[17212.64 - 17219.04] August right you know that was a special
[17216.60 - 17221.60] moment in my life right I I went into
[17219.04 - 17224.68] the water it was a cold water in Maine
[17221.60 - 17227.60] all right up north on the East Coast
[17224.68 - 17230.48] okay and the water was frigid freezing
[17227.60 - 17232.28] cold and basically I wanted to say my
[17230.48 - 17234.04] dog that got caught in the
[17232.28 - 17236.60] current
[17234.04 - 17239.04] and when I jumped in spirit of
[17236.60 - 17241.72] compassion said that's a death sentence
[17239.04 - 17243.56] you're not coming back out of here
[17241.72 - 17245.88] you're not you're not going to make it
[17243.56 - 17248.08] back out of here you have to turn around
[17245.88 - 17249.84] and I saw my dog way out there like
[17248.08 - 17252.08] caught in a little bit of seaweed and
[17249.84 - 17255.08] kind of going down and I said I don't
[17252.08 - 17257.84] care what it takes because I need to do
[17255.08 - 17260.44] this does it matter I have to do this I
[17257.84 - 17262.88] remember when I got out there and I had
[17260.44 - 17265.04] a few more more breaths left in me and I
[17262.88 - 17268.20] went down in the water and I saw my dog
[17265.04 - 17271.40] under the water okay and do you guys
[17268.20 - 17274.12] remember what happened you
[17271.40 - 17276.28] remember I opened my eyes in that water
[17274.12 - 17280.84] down there that freezing cold water and
[17276.28 - 17285.24] there was an angel holding on to my dog
[17280.84 - 17285.24] underwater yeah all
[17286.08 - 17290.84] right
[17288.08 - 17293.64] yeah and I grabbed that dog out of the
[17290.84 - 17295.24] Angel's hands and I just took my dog to
[17293.64 - 17299.04] the surface
[17295.24 - 17300.92] August and then Spirit of compassion
[17299.04 - 17304.24] second time ever did it did did did you
[17300.92 - 17306.60] read that part second time ever I saw
[17304.24 - 17309.04] Spirit of compassion it's not like I see
[17306.60 - 17311.96] Spirit of compassion it's rare it's it
[17309.04 - 17313.52] was the second time and I got to that
[17311.96 - 17315.08] water and spirit of compassion said you
[17313.52 - 17317.76] got to get back
[17315.08 - 17320.88] now you got to get back now because that
[17317.76 - 17324.40] angel isn't going to be sticking around
[17320.88 - 17326.16] because I was lucky that angel was there
[17324.40 - 17328.80] but Angel wasn't going to stay around
[17326.16 - 17331.28] and have me Meander because I was only
[17328.80 - 17334.36] basically living off of that Angelic
[17331.28 - 17337.12] light in that moment in that water
[17334.36 - 17339.72] because I was already in
[17337.12 - 17343.44] hypothermia
[17339.72 - 17346.64] hypothermia so I came back to
[17343.44 - 17349.20] shore I was alive and I knew I had to
[17346.64 - 17350.96] make the commitment there and wasn't
[17349.20 - 17353.84] going to kick and scream anymore and I
[17350.96 - 17356.20] wasn't going to fight fight fight it and
[17353.84 - 17358.48] fight hearing Spirit of compassion and I
[17356.20 - 17360.12] knew this is the direction I had to go
[17358.48 - 17363.16] it didn't matter what I really wanted to
[17360.12 - 17365.04] do never was about that but I had to
[17363.16 - 17367.28] make that commitment and I had to stand
[17365.04 - 17372.08] strong and I had to be like no this is
[17367.28 - 17375.20] it I'm committed now I am I can't unsee
[17372.08 - 17378.56] what I saw under that water that angel
[17375.20 - 17380.76] was there I hear a voice I saw a spirit
[17378.56 - 17382.92] of compassion twice in my life can't
[17380.76 - 17385.72] unsee
[17382.92 - 17387.28] that so I have to work for the
[17385.72 - 17390.68] chronically ill I have to work for the
[17387.28 - 17394.36] people I have to do it no matter what
[17390.68 - 17397.04] you know when we get sick sometimes we
[17394.36 - 17400.12] kick and scream too
[17397.04 - 17402.44] right we do I've heard of stories where
[17400.12 - 17404.52] people are like I wanted to do medical
[17402.44 - 17407.00] medium it just wasn't there it just
[17404.52 - 17409.80] wasn't there yet do you ever hear of
[17407.00 - 17411.72] anybody like that wanted to try medical
[17409.80 - 17414.68] medium information and it just wasn't
[17411.72 - 17417.40] there yet right kind of kicking and
[17414.68 - 17419.68] screaming to get to the truth to get to
[17417.40 - 17422.52] the information
[17419.68 - 17424.24] right I've seen that out there well I
[17422.52 - 17426.72] had a kick and scream to get to here and
[17424.24 - 17427.84] I know that other people do too to get
[17426.72 - 17431.72] to this
[17427.84 - 17433.56] point and then they find the
[17431.72 - 17436.72] information and now it's about
[17433.56 - 17439.12] committing time and energy that takes a
[17436.72 - 17441.12] kick in a scream you start with a little
[17439.12 - 17443.16] bit of celery juice or you start with
[17441.12 - 17445.12] maybe one of the meditations or you
[17443.16 - 17448.08] start with something
[17445.12 - 17451.64] right but you eventually get there and
[17448.08 - 17456.12] then you're committed and now you're in
[17451.64 - 17458.08] it and guess what happens then freedom
[17456.12 - 17462.12] and you know what happened when I
[17458.08 - 17466.76] rescued August in that cold ocean
[17462.12 - 17468.44] water and I hit the shore it was Freedom
[17466.76 - 17472.24] it was freedom I didn't have to fight it
[17468.44 - 17474.00] anymore I was committed all the way
[17472.24 - 17477.60] I wasn't just saying it
[17474.00 - 17481.12] anymore before that I would say it yeah
[17477.60 - 17483.72] yeah no I'm in I'm in I'm in but no
[17481.12 - 17485.56] after that and I hit the shore I had my
[17483.72 - 17489.56] dog in my
[17485.56 - 17492.84] arms I was committed and freedom started
[17489.56 - 17495.24] for me freedom of being like kind of on
[17492.84 - 17498.00] the fence a little bit and fighting it
[17495.24 - 17499.92] and that freedom you know when you find
[17498.00 - 17502.04] medical medium information of Freedom
[17499.92 - 17504.40] happens you're free from the fish oil
[17502.04 - 17506.72] [ __ ] you're free from the right the
[17504.40 - 17509.92] protein protein protein Pro is that
[17506.72 - 17511.56] insane the protein thing the protein
[17509.92 - 17513.48] demon
[17511.56 - 17514.64] unbelievable as if the world isn't
[17513.48 - 17516.72] getting
[17514.64 - 17518.88] protein everybody's sick they're dying
[17516.72 - 17520.80] in hospitals all kinds of problems are
[17518.88 - 17523.44] happening they're getting all the
[17520.80 - 17525.44] protein you could ever even imagine do
[17523.44 - 17526.80] you ever you ever see that you run into
[17525.44 - 17528.24] somebody you're like yeah you're protein
[17526.80 - 17530.96] efficient you're not getting enough
[17528.24 - 17533.16] protein that's why you're sick you're
[17530.96 - 17535.20] free from that think about it you're
[17533.16 - 17537.32] free from that
[17535.20 - 17539.56] Insanity ah it's
[17537.32 - 17542.72] incredible but that
[17539.56 - 17545.60] freedom that freedom is real and you
[17542.72 - 17548.00] know what it takes too to
[17545.60 - 17550.32] also experience that freedom is your
[17548.00 - 17552.32] free will and the thing is what you guys
[17550.32 - 17553.96] is you guys access your free will did
[17552.32 - 17555.44] you hear that podcast I did about Free
[17553.96 - 17557.32] Will at one point did some of you guys
[17555.44 - 17559.04] hear that some of you guys heard it
[17557.32 - 17562.40] right
[17559.04 - 17565.68] right wasn't that a good one that was a
[17562.40 - 17567.20] good one I listen to that one I listen
[17565.68 - 17569.84] to that one you wouldn't believe it but
[17567.20 - 17573.96] I do I turn it on and I listen to it I'm
[17569.84 - 17576.88] like wow this is incredible oh my God I
[17573.96 - 17579.48] can't believe it not because I'm trying
[17576.88 - 17582.56] to like you know my head's all swelling
[17579.48 - 17584.48] and I'm like egoed out it's because it's
[17582.56 - 17586.52] not my words they're it's Spirit of
[17584.48 - 17588.56] compassion's words so then when I'm away
[17586.52 - 17591.36] from it a little bit I forget kind of
[17588.56 - 17593.92] what Spirit of compassion said so then I
[17591.36 - 17596.88] got to listen to the episode and be like
[17593.92 - 17600.24] damn that's just oh my
[17596.88 - 17603.72] God you didn't let me down you didn't
[17600.24 - 17605.08] let me down you showed up for me man you
[17603.72 - 17608.24] showed up for
[17605.08 - 17609.92] me your free will is like no other Free
[17608.24 - 17611.96] Will I can tell you that because you can
[17609.92 - 17615.68] have free will and use it all the wrong
[17611.96 - 17617.48] way you can have free will and screw up
[17615.68 - 17619.20] sure that's life that's how it works
[17617.48 - 17620.68] down here on planet Earth of course
[17619.20 - 17622.44] everybody makes mistakes all all the
[17620.68 - 17624.96] time they use their Free Will in doing
[17622.44 - 17626.76] it but also they get blocked too so
[17624.96 - 17629.00] they're on autopilot with their Free
[17626.76 - 17630.88] Will and they start using their Free
[17629.00 - 17633.56] Will without kind of realizing it it
[17630.88 - 17635.56] gets used instantly like compulsion it's
[17633.56 - 17639.52] free will that's not really in their
[17635.56 - 17641.88] favor serving them it's not serving them
[17639.52 - 17643.84] right I just got comfortable using that
[17641.88 - 17645.52] word recently because in the New Age
[17643.84 - 17648.76] movement it's like you know things that
[17645.52 - 17650.88] serve you and stuff serve you okay but
[17648.76 - 17652.72] yeah it wasn't serving people the way
[17650.88 - 17655.48] the way it works with free will
[17652.72 - 17658.32] sometimes but you guys you did something
[17655.48 - 17661.44] different like you shifted your free
[17658.32 - 17663.36] will into a whole different area like
[17661.44 - 17665.40] you really are using your free will you
[17663.36 - 17669.00] got control over your free will how
[17665.40 - 17671.12] about that control over it that's
[17669.00 - 17674.28] mindblowing right there all on its own
[17671.12 - 17677.52] think about that okay there's a
[17674.28 - 17678.32] difference because you guys are piloting
[17677.52 - 17682.28] your
[17678.32 - 17685.44] ships you are piloting your
[17682.28 - 17687.48] ship you really are something to be said
[17685.44 - 17689.24] it's something to know you guys have
[17687.48 - 17690.80] committed yourselves you're in it you're
[17689.24 - 17693.48] in it to heal your body and guess who
[17690.80 - 17696.68] loves you for it who loves you for being
[17693.48 - 17698.00] committed your body your body loves you
[17696.68 - 17699.32] how many of you guys thought that it was
[17698.00 - 17701.92] your fault you were sick that's what I
[17699.32 - 17703.56] wanted to ask you guys you thought it
[17701.92 - 17704.92] was your fault Tobias over there you
[17703.56 - 17709.04] thought it was your
[17704.92 - 17711.40] fault right yeah isn't that crazy how it
[17709.04 - 17713.88] works you're not crazy the system set up
[17711.40 - 17715.88] like that it's set up so that you think
[17713.88 - 17718.96] you're the reason why you're sick it's
[17715.88 - 17722.44] your fault you created it how many of
[17718.96 - 17725.00] you guys searching while you were sick
[17722.44 - 17728.08] came across the understanding that you
[17725.00 - 17729.92] created your illness you manifested it
[17728.08 - 17732.36] right through manifestation you actually
[17729.92 - 17734.16] created it it's not just you're the
[17732.36 - 17736.72] reason you're at fault and you're the
[17734.16 - 17741.72] reason why you're sick you you made it
[17736.72 - 17743.64] happen how about that one right there
[17741.72 - 17746.84] I mean if that's not dark I don't know
[17743.64 - 17748.76] what is what is in dark cuz that's not
[17746.84 - 17750.68] the truth that's not the truth it's
[17748.76 - 17752.36] Death By A Thousand Cuts out there there
[17750.68 - 17754.28] lots of exposures there's lots of things
[17752.36 - 17755.80] that make us sick and then the scale
[17754.28 - 17758.60] gets tipped you guys know this
[17755.80 - 17762.12] information right probably know it
[17758.60 - 17762.12] better than I do at this point
[17765.48 - 17770.84] right but you guys found freedom is what
[17768.72 - 17772.52] you did even if you're still in your
[17770.84 - 17774.56] healing process right now so I want to
[17772.52 - 17778.40] take it to that level right
[17774.56 - 17781.72] there healing works in mysterious ways
[17778.40 - 17783.84] one way is the nervous system needs time
[17781.72 - 17786.16] to heal after you've already healed
[17783.84 - 17789.92] there's people that have already healed
[17786.16 - 17792.24] they're healed they fixed their problem
[17789.92 - 17794.60] they did they still have residuals they
[17792.24 - 17796.92] still have their nerves that are need
[17794.60 - 17799.04] time to heal that's always last it's
[17796.92 - 17801.40] always last but it takes your free will
[17799.04 - 17803.36] to just understand that and soak that up
[17801.40 - 17805.92] a little bit and be like okay
[17803.36 - 17808.12] okay it's not my fault I didn't create
[17805.92 - 17810.16] it my nerves just need more time to heal
[17808.12 - 17812.96] that's important to know all on its
[17810.16 - 17815.76] own I think the one thing about us
[17812.96 - 17817.60] thinking that we're the cause of our
[17815.76 - 17821.04] sickness and illness and we manifested
[17817.60 - 17824.24] it I think that brings you to a place of
[17821.04 - 17825.76] hopelessness because you must be a bad
[17824.24 - 17828.28] person if you're the reason why you're
[17825.76 - 17831.12] sick and you caused
[17828.28 - 17833.56] it truth is it's the opposite with you
[17831.12 - 17835.64] guys and people out there who are sick
[17833.56 - 17837.00] or just got sick it's not your fault you
[17835.64 - 17840.08] didn't cause
[17837.00 - 17842.12] it your body loves you unconditionally
[17840.08 - 17843.16] you guys know the autoimmune Theory do
[17842.12 - 17844.36] you guys remember that one the
[17843.16 - 17847.04] autoimmune
[17844.36 - 17849.04] Theory right your body's attacking
[17847.04 - 17852.48] itself oh
[17849.04 - 17855.80] no that's your immune system attacking
[17852.48 - 17857.72] its glands attacking its organs that's
[17855.80 - 17860.64] why you're sick it's your immune system
[17857.72 - 17862.48] right attacking you it's another trap
[17860.64 - 17864.96] out there and that's what I mean by
[17862.48 - 17867.60] Freedom medical medium information is
[17864.96 - 17869.80] true freedom because you learn and once
[17867.60 - 17872.40] you learn hey my immune system didn't
[17869.80 - 17875.80] attack my organs it didn't attack my
[17872.40 - 17878.12] glands it's not attacking me but science
[17875.80 - 17879.80] must know it truly must know they can't
[17878.12 - 17882.24] be wrong all those smart people out
[17879.80 - 17883.88] there in the world but they are wrong it
[17882.24 - 17886.16] was a theory in the
[17883.88 - 17887.00] 1950s you know how it works you know how
[17886.16 - 17889.88] it
[17887.00 - 17893.88] rolls back to Freedom again you know the
[17889.88 - 17896.80] ditch the fish oil tablets and capsules
[17893.88 - 17898.76] or whatever you know to ditch the bad
[17896.80 - 17901.60] stuff I'm just using that as one is one
[17898.76 - 17904.48] example you know it's not Protein that's
[17901.60 - 17906.00] not why you were sick you guys know that
[17904.48 - 17908.80] you know your body's not attacking
[17906.00 - 17910.96] itself you know that you know you didn't
[17908.80 - 17912.76] create it or manifest it right you know
[17910.96 - 17915.52] that you see all the traps I'm running
[17912.76 - 17920.16] through them one trap after another one
[17915.52 - 17922.12] one trap after another that's right
[17920.16 - 17923.72] but don't worry some 22-year-old who's

[18177.96 - 18183.60] on to them you got to know what they
[18181.32 - 18185.20] are you believe in God you don't have to
[18183.60 - 18188.20] believe in God anybody believe in God in
[18185.20 - 18188.20] here
[18191.12 - 18195.84] medical medium book one was a little
[18194.24 - 18197.52] difficult because I was putting God in
[18195.84 - 18201.96] there every minute you
[18197.52 - 18204.48] know I was I think back
[18201.96 - 18206.40] then unless you were a
[18204.48 - 18209.00] minister of
[18206.40 - 18212.24] Faith right or a
[18209.00 - 18214.68] priest or somebody you can use that word
[18212.24 - 18216.60] God I don't know if you remember a
[18214.68 - 18218.08] decade ago kind of well you weren't
[18216.60 - 18220.88] allowed to use God too much you know
[18218.08 - 18222.40] that right
[18220.88 - 18224.44] and I was putting God all through the
[18222.40 - 18225.92] medical medium book one wait a minute
[18224.44 - 18228.00] though he's a medium why is he saying
[18225.92 - 18229.88] God because it says in the Bible thou
[18228.00 - 18231.84] who listens to some kind of voice in the
[18229.88 - 18236.64] air or whatever who practices with the
[18231.84 - 18236.64] crystal ball is damned to hell
[18237.32 - 18240.88] right it's a funny
[18241.68 - 18246.56] one you know when you hear a
[18247.52 - 18254.24] voice that just wants people people to
[18250.84 - 18258.84] heal and gives them tools to
[18254.24 - 18258.84] heal I don't know anything closer to
[18258.86 - 18270.32] [Applause]
[18267.92 - 18271.96] God those pillars are critical you
[18270.32 - 18274.08] believe in God that's a pillar that's
[18271.96 - 18275.56] faith in your life that's a landmark in
[18274.08 - 18277.64] your life you believe in God if you
[18275.56 - 18279.20] don't believe in God that's okay Creator
[18277.64 - 18280.96] the light maybe you believe in the
[18279.20 - 18283.40] universe you've heard me say that all
[18280.96 - 18285.08] these years right whatever it is that's
[18283.40 - 18287.48] kind of a pillar in your life that's
[18285.08 - 18289.48] your faith right well believe in the
[18287.48 - 18291.72] fact that you're seasoned and you're
[18289.48 - 18293.60] experienced and you've been there you
[18291.72 - 18296.68] tried that you done this you guys are
[18293.60 - 18300.08] the real deal hold that as a pillar so
[18296.68 - 18304.24] you don't get rocked or
[18300.08 - 18306.92] waver you hang tight to that it's
[18304.24 - 18309.32] critical something you hold on
[18306.92 - 18310.80] to cuz face it you guys probably don't
[18309.32 - 18312.08] get enough credit do you guys get a ton
[18310.80 - 18315.60] of
[18312.08 - 18317.24] credit no you don't get a lot of credit
[18315.60 - 18318.24] everywhere you go someone doesn't hand
[18317.24 - 18322.08] you a
[18318.24 - 18323.88] metal you laid in bed for 20 years you
[18322.08 - 18325.64] went through hell and back here's a
[18323.88 - 18328.20] metal
[18325.64 - 18330.52] no oh you laid in bed for 20 years sure
[18328.20 - 18333.00] you were sick
[18330.52 - 18336.44] right what about that whole
[18333.00 - 18342.04] thing people being sick and struggling
[18336.44 - 18343.48] but you look fine right you look fine I
[18342.04 - 18345.40] you know what I'm I'm glad that was
[18343.48 - 18347.04] taken from medical medium there's some
[18345.40 - 18349.04] things that are poached that I'm happy
[18347.04 - 18351.52] about some things I'm poached that are
[18349.04 - 18353.72] poached that I'm not happy about right
[18351.52 - 18355.72] but when that was poached about the fact
[18353.72 - 18357.48] that you can't see the illness but you
[18355.72 - 18359.80] walk around with it and you suffer with
[18357.48 - 18361.72] it with every single symptom but people
[18359.80 - 18363.60] say you look fine there's nothing wrong
[18361.72 - 18365.44] with you what are you talking about it
[18363.60 - 18367.84] must be in your head you must be lazy or
[18365.44 - 18369.72] bored something's just up with you you
[18367.84 - 18373.20] got to see a psychiatrist maybe a
[18369.72 - 18377.32] therapist you got a fear of
[18373.20 - 18380.00] healing right but that invisible
[18377.32 - 18381.44] illness that you can't see I didn't mind
[18380.00 - 18382.96] when that was poached because you know
[18381.44 - 18384.12] what it's doing a lot of people a lot of
[18382.96 - 18385.80] good out there even if they don't know
[18384.12 - 18387.76] medical medium
[18385.80 - 18389.48] information but there's some things that
[18387.76 - 18392.08] get poach it's sad because if they don't
[18389.48 - 18394.28] know their way back to where it starts

[18400.88 - 18405.64] ever see that you're talking to us all

[19000.55 - 19012.32] [Applause]
[19008.88 - 19014.68] right I recognized the medical medium I
[19012.32 - 19016.76] had read like a little blog about him
[19014.68 - 19018.92] and yeah just like a little seed was
[19016.76 - 19020.60] planted I started listening and then a
[19018.92 - 19023.40] couple years later is when I started
[19020.60 - 19025.12] using his tools because I got desperate
[19023.40 - 19027.92] with my symptoms I struggled with
[19025.12 - 19030.64] chronic UTI for about 20 years and I was
[19027.92 - 19032.60] on antibiotic every month sometimes
[19030.64 - 19034.88] every week I probably took hundreds of
[19032.60 - 19037.36] rounds of antibiotics throughout those
[19034.88 - 19038.92] 15 to 20 years and it wasn't until I
[19037.36 - 19041.64] found his information that I was able to
[19038.92 - 19044.44] clear those on my own and I've been UTI
[19041.64 - 19046.76] free for probably 3 or 4 years and
[19044.44 - 19049.60] antibiotic free for 5 years but I just
[19046.76 - 19052.24] wanted to meet Anthony and thank him for
[19049.60 - 19053.88] just giving me a new life really when I
[19052.24 - 19056.96] was pregnant with my son I started to
[19053.88 - 19059.36] feel these symptoms with like difficulty
[19056.96 - 19061.32] digesting I pretty much couldn't eat
[19059.36 - 19063.80] anything it just kept getting worse and
[19061.32 - 19066.96] worse and my symptoms were out of
[19063.80 - 19068.96] control and I you know went to all the
[19066.96 - 19070.84] doctors and naturopaths and nobody
[19068.96 - 19073.60] really had an answer and I was really
[19070.84 - 19076.88] desperate one time I went to a bookstore
[19073.60 - 19078.76] I saw his book his first book and I was
[19076.88 - 19080.92] curious about it I read a little bit and
[19078.76 - 19083.72] I was like I'm not sure so I just kind
[19080.92 - 19086.80] of put it back a few weeks later through
[19083.72 - 19088.84] a friend I was telling her you know that
[19086.80 - 19092.00] I'm feeling these symptoms I can't eat
[19088.84 - 19093.76] anything I felt like I was slowly dying
[19092.00 - 19096.28] and she said you should check out
[19093.76 - 19098.16] medical medium and I was like what I
[19096.28 - 19100.96] just saw his book and she's like yeah
[19098.16 - 19102.60] you should read it and I did and I mean
[19100.96 - 19103.80] everything changed for me after that
[19102.60 - 19106.88] everything I mean the fact that I can
[19103.80 - 19109.12] come here and eat eat this food and
[19106.88 - 19111.32] whereas before it was impossible
[19109.12 - 19115.44] impossible so that's kind of what drew
[19111.32 - 19119.40] me and I'm so grateful I would say I
[19115.44 - 19121.76] am such a stronger mother
[19119.40 - 19123.92] I just asked my 14-year-old son I said
[19121.76 - 19125.60] when was last time you were sick and it
[19123.92 - 19128.12] was just a long
[19125.60 - 19132.12] pause we realized it was over 2 years
[19128.12 - 19135.00] ago before learning mm I never knew
[19132.12 - 19137.76] which supplement to buy I didn't know
[19135.00 - 19141.12] what to stay away from I didn't know how
[19137.76 - 19143.44] much to give a child that is
[19141.12 - 19145.60] huge so I would say you know do I give
[19143.44 - 19148.00] him 1,5 what's too much am I going to
[19145.60 - 19149.44] hurt him you know so now I know I have
[19148.00 - 19150.56] the power
[19149.44 - 19152.96] I've been using medical medium
[19150.56 - 19155.40] information for 8 years and I started
[19152.96 - 19157.88] off kind of slow and needed to build my
[19155.40 - 19160.68] trust with the information and the new
[19157.88 - 19162.80] mentality of how to eat and heal but
[19160.68 - 19164.96] just step by step I slowly implemented
[19162.80 - 19168.24] one item at a time pretty much every two
[19164.96 - 19170.20] weeks and each time it blew me away so I
[19168.24 - 19174.20] kept going and it would took me about 3
[19170.20 - 19178.08] years to fully dive in my biggest change
[19174.20 - 19181.80] I would say was healing dyslexia add um
[19178.08 - 19184.76] depression anxiety OCD thoughts and it
[19181.80 - 19187.44] still took me maybe a year to really get
[19184.76 - 19189.92] out of that but once I did it was like a
[19187.44 - 19192.20] breath of fresh air to lead a normal
[19189.92 - 19193.76] life to have new opportunities to feel
[19192.20 - 19196.56] confident and you know feel like
[19193.76 - 19199.45] yourself again so I yeah I was lucky
[19196.56 - 19202.54] that I found this information and
[19199.45 - 19202.54] [Music]
[19204.72 - 19210.08] healed I was diagnosed with hypothyroid
[19207.80 - 19211.92] about 4 years later I kind of I found
[19210.08 - 19214.08] medical medium's advice and I said
[19211.92 - 19216.32] finally there's an answer of why because
[19214.08 - 19219.00] I've always said why why do I get this
[19216.32 - 19221.16] why do you have this what's this and
[19219.00 - 19222.40] there's a reason and he gives a reason
[19221.16 - 19225.04] and that's kind of what I was always
[19222.40 - 19228.60] looking for so Through The Years just I
[19225.04 - 19231.44] would say um having energy being alive
[19228.60 - 19234.20] not on at my age any medication I'm
[19231.44 - 19236.64] super thrilled about that and never want
[19234.20 - 19238.36] to be and I just believe the body
[19236.64 - 19240.68] naturally does want to heal if you give
[19238.36 - 19243.44] it the the right things well I was
[19240.68 - 19245.52] diagnosed with Graves sometime last year
[19243.44 - 19248.04] and after being on medical median for
[19245.52 - 19250.08] like 6 months my doctor finally told me
[19248.04 - 19253.04] that I'm in remission when we got the
[19250.08 - 19254.52] news last year was like spring uh it hit
[19253.04 - 19256.44] her really hard it's just like you have
[19254.52 - 19258.80] to be on medicine your whole life or
[19256.44 - 19261.44] remove your thyroid ready she wasn't
[19258.80 - 19262.92] having it she was searching for answers
[19261.44 - 19264.84] and then eventually came across
[19262.92 - 19266.96] Anthony's book beforehand she tried
[19264.84 - 19268.64] going off the medicine symptoms came
[19266.96 - 19270.00] back like within a couple weeks and we
[19268.64 - 19271.36] were both kind of disappointed cuz it
[19270.00 - 19273.44] was doing well when she was on the
[19271.36 - 19275.92] medicine and then the summer she took
[19273.44 - 19277.84] herself off and like you know nothing
[19275.92 - 19280.40] really changed too much and she just
[19277.84 - 19282.20] kept with the diet and then yeah went to
[19280.40 - 19284.08] the the doctor and they told her that it
[19282.20 - 19286.84] was in remission did blood work and all
[19284.08 - 19288.32] of that and I was thrilled naturally I
[19286.84 - 19291.32] just wanted her to be happy and she is
[19288.32 - 19292.44] she's happy and healthy I would say what
[19291.32 - 19295.44] predominantly brought me to the
[19292.44 - 19298.08] information was I had really bad mental
[19295.44 - 19299.08] health struggles very severe depression
[19298.08 - 19301.72] to where
[19299.08 - 19304.52] I'd wake up and I couldn't pinpoint why
[19301.72 - 19307.36] I felt that way but I was just so low
[19304.52 - 19310.16] and for most of my life I struggled with
[19307.36 - 19312.92] depression and anxiety um among other
[19310.16 - 19315.44] struggles and it's symptoms I've made
[19312.92 - 19317.16] like a lot of traction with I feel
[19315.44 - 19319.48] amazing that I'm able to cope with
[19317.16 - 19322.36] things in a lot more resilient of a way
[19319.48 - 19324.36] so it feels very freeing I came about
[19322.36 - 19327.80] the information to help my patients and
[19324.36 - 19331.00] family I think that as doctors we can
[19327.80 - 19332.60] see what we are actually doing to
[19331.00 - 19334.56] patients because a lot of patients are
[19332.60 - 19336.20] suffering some side effects and when
[19334.56 - 19338.72] they come back we put them on more
[19336.20 - 19339.92] medications to help with the side
[19338.72 - 19342.68] effects and they end up with more and
[19339.92 - 19345.84] more medications and the procedures we
[19342.68 - 19348.20] see a lot of um negative effect from
[19345.84 - 19350.28] procedures that we perform really
[19348.20 - 19352.64] witnessing that should alert us are we
[19350.28 - 19354.80] really helping patients with those
[19352.64 - 19357.48] things that we do to
[19354.80 - 19360.28] them wow what a great lecture and that
[19357.48 - 19363.00] life blast tonight was so powerful did
[19360.28 - 19364.68] you guys feel that powerful light blast
[19363.00 - 19367.28] like we were feeling it here in Venice
[19364.68 - 19368.64] at home it was just incredible we're
[19367.28 - 19371.16] going to talk to some of the guests

[19423.68 - 19429.04] great what beautiful people like we have
[19426.56 - 19431.68] a a table full of women telling stories
[19429.04 - 19433.80] of like hope recovery things they've
[19431.68 - 19437.36] been through and you feel a sense of
[19433.80 - 19439.76] community and um how food can heal you
[19437.36 - 19441.40] it's like gosh I wish there were more
[19439.76 - 19443.92] moments like this in life but it feels
[19441.40 - 19445.96] really special and lovely how was your
[19443.92 - 19449.48] experience like with tonight's life
[19445.96 - 19450.84] blast it was amazing I felt it
[19449.48 - 19453.40] immediately I actually had like a
[19450.84 - 19455.80] toothache and it's kind of gone um and
[19453.40 - 19458.44] we were actually holding hands she like
[19455.80 - 19460.36] I'm more ingratiated into medical medium
[19458.44 - 19462.20] she's a little bit like slowly getting
[19460.36 - 19464.12] into it so I made her hold my hand
[19462.20 - 19466.44] because I was like you you know got to
[19464.12 - 19468.92] send that energy to her but I don't know
[19466.44 - 19470.64] it was great I loved it what did you
[19468.92 - 19473.36] feel during that Li Bloss well I you
[19470.64 - 19476.16] know like I'm I am not that spiritual of
[19473.36 - 19478.40] a person but I felt like this is really
[19476.16 - 19480.32] fun and quirky and different and maybe
[19478.40 - 19482.56] you know like I don't know there's
[19480.32 - 19484.16] there's positive energy and I feel that
[19482.56 - 19486.56] Virgo is going to be gone now and then
[19484.16 - 19488.52] yeah maybe I'll change my mind yeah when
[19486.56 - 19491.20] I'm like reverse aging I'll I'll change
[19488.52 - 19493.00] my mind on it and what is it about the
[19491.20 - 19495.80] medical medium protocol that You' first
[19493.00 - 19498.32] started now and what what are some of
[19495.80 - 19500.08] your favorite uh you know smoothies
[19498.32 - 19502.76] juices and what health benefits have you
[19500.08 - 19504.96] found so I've been dealing with ver for
[19502.76 - 19506.76] the past 6 months and I had I quit
[19504.96 - 19509.20] caffeine I've taken a lot of cues from
[19506.76 - 19511.56] Lauren um the C juice in the morning is
[19509.20 - 19513.88] so important the heavy metal detex
[19511.56 - 19516.12] smoothie and I'm not always perfect but
[19513.88 - 19518.28] for me it's like ginger is great for
[19516.12 - 19520.76] inflammation there's certain elements
[19518.28 - 19523.32] that I you know Ginger and turmeric and
[19520.76 - 19526.08] spirulina and it's like adding these
[19523.32 - 19528.36] things in and slowly over time taking
[19526.08 - 19530.64] things out and I like that Anthony talks
[19528.36 - 19533.28] about maybe you just change one thing
[19530.64 - 19535.16] that that's me I'm not you know Lauren
[19533.28 - 19537.72] has has gotten to the point where she
[19535.16 - 19539.92] can live a really clean protocol I'm
[19537.72 - 19542.64] just doing it step by step but I see
[19539.92 - 19545.68] enough Improvement in how I feel and my
[19542.64 - 19548.48] energy to keep going and I hope to just
[19545.68 - 19550.04] keep getting better at it what a
[19548.48 - 19551.96] beautiful way to do the protocol
[19550.04 - 19554.80] together is it inspiring watching each
[19551.96 - 19557.08] other heal it's so inspiring she
[19554.80 - 19558.84] inspires me every day we Inspire each
[19557.08 - 19560.96] other it's it's
[19558.84 - 19562.84] great do you ever get in the kitchen
[19560.96 - 19564.36] together and make some of the recipes oh
[19562.84 - 19566.56] yeah she's a better cook than me
[19564.36 - 19568.60] actually like I mean I've done it so
[19566.56 - 19570.24] long I'm a grizzled vet like I do the
[19568.60 - 19572.36] same things over and over she'll like
[19570.24 - 19574.60] get creative I'm like oh man this tastes
[19572.36 - 19576.12] good but she is like very strict I'll be
[19574.60 - 19579.76] like do you want to put like a Parmesan
[19576.12 - 19582.56] R and she's like so she's like very
[19579.76 - 19584.96] medical medium seasoned but um I'm
[19582.56 - 19586.84] better for it so she's a good influence
[19584.96 - 19588.88] yeah she's doing it out of love yeah
[19586.84 - 19591.36] absolutely what did you think of the
[19588.88 - 19592.96] food tonight what was your favorite dish
[19591.36 - 19595.40] um the pizza was incredible I haven't
[19592.96 - 19597.88] had pizza in so long and the
[19595.40 - 19601.36] Mediterranean pizza sorry I ate both
[19597.88 - 19603.36] Pizza is but it was so good it just like
[19601.36 - 19604.60] had it was analogous to pepperoni in an
[19603.36 - 19607.44] interesting way and I thought it was
[19604.60 - 19609.60] really good well I loved all the food
[19607.44 - 19612.44] but for me you know Lauren's been doing
[19609.60 - 19613.88] this for 9 years uh this is the first
[19612.44 - 19615.52] time in 9 years where I've gotten to go
[19613.88 - 19618.44] out to eat with Lauren and she hasn't
[19615.52 - 19620.36] had to bring her own food that means the
[19618.44 - 19622.00] world to see my sister sit down and eat
[19620.36 - 19625.32] a full meal and be taken care of and not
[19622.00 - 19627.32] be judged um so to me the food's
[19625.32 - 19628.84] excellent but it's also someone created
[19627.32 - 19631.08] this environment where you can feel
[19628.84 - 19634.16] included and
[19631.08 - 19636.28] seen it makes me emotional but it's
[19634.16 - 19639.00] beautiful she deserves that all the time
[19636.28 - 19640.92] but to get it like this is so special
[19639.00 - 19642.84] yeah so special do you enjoy hanging out
[19640.92 - 19644.84] with the medical maum community in this
[19642.84 - 19646.80] environment like like your sister saying
[19644.84 - 19648.80] it's a beautiful environment everybody
[19646.80 - 19650.00] understands one another there's a quiet
[19648.80 - 19652.28] understanding you don't even have to
[19650.00 - 19654.56] really explain yourself to someone and
[19652.28 - 19656.68] we all look fine but we've all been
[19654.56 - 19659.80] through a lot and it's just a beautiful
[19656.68 - 19662.36] thing to share no we spoke to someone
[19659.80 - 19664.32] who she was like my goal was to just
[19662.36 - 19665.80] walk at my friend's wedding and she got
[19664.32 - 19668.16] to do that and I think like when you
[19665.80 - 19670.96] think of Cafe Gratitude it's like that's
[19668.16 - 19672.76] it it's gratitude like you get gratitude
[19670.96 - 19674.56] for the smallest thing that we take for
[19672.76 - 19676.72] granted in life to walk at your friend's
[19674.56 - 19678.52] wedding to see your sister eat a meal
[19676.72 - 19681.36] that she couldn't eat that's so
[19678.52 - 19683.24] beautiful and Powerful yeah are you
[19681.36 - 19686.36] excited for Cafe Gratitude to continue
[19683.24 - 19688.28] offering these dishes on the menu yeah
[19686.36 - 19690.20] because if we can build more more
[19688.28 - 19692.04] communities like this people can heal
[19690.20 - 19694.44] and I'm not saying it's for everybody
[19692.04 - 19695.80] but there should be a space for all the
[19694.44 - 19698.88] people who want to heal or aren't
[19695.80 - 19700.68] getting answers and want to empower
[19698.88 - 19702.32] themselves you know there's there's
[19700.68 - 19704.48] things that your doctor can tell you but
[19702.32 - 19706.84] if you if you want to believe you can
[19704.48 - 19709.84] heal yourself this is how you start with
[19706.84 - 19712.52] how you eat and we need more places like
[19709.84 - 19713.84] this for sure and finally do you have an
[19712.52 - 19716.36] encouraging message you'd like to share
[19713.84 - 19717.84] with the community watching tonight I
[19716.36 - 19720.52] would say just start small wherever
[19717.84 - 19722.84] you're at every day sometimes it's just
[19720.52 - 19725.68] one little thing go through one minute 1
[19722.84 - 19727.84] second one hour I know everyone's going
[19725.68 - 19730.12] through tough things we get setbacks
[19727.84 - 19732.60] just keep going there's light at the end
[19730.12 - 19734.52] of the tunnel There's Hope yeah and if
[19732.60 - 19737.04] you don't believe in this stuff just
[19734.52 - 19739.08] talk to one person who's experienced it
[19737.04 - 19740.68] because you know Lauren gets a message
[19739.08 - 19742.96] from people all the time who are looking
[19740.68 - 19744.28] for answers like you're the living proof
[19742.96 - 19745.96] there's so many people that are living
[19744.28 - 19747.52] proof that you know they got an
[19745.96 - 19751.48] infection they use this protocol they
[19747.52 - 19753.44] got better like it's these people are
[19751.48 - 19755.84] all recovering and if you're searching
[19753.44 - 19757.28] for answers reach out it's I don't know
[19755.84 - 19759.88] it's a beautiful thing pick up a book

[20026.64 - 20031.92] progressing oh I would say probably
[20029.00 - 20034.64] pretty much right away um I was in such
[20031.92 - 20036.92] a bad place though it took a while to
[20034.64 - 20041.48] feel like I was functioning as a normal
[20036.92 - 20043.60] person but um it was it was pretty
[20041.48 - 20046.12] quick that's incredible what other
