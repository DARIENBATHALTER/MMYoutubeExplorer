Amazing. Is Patrick still here? Is he

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,359
still here tonight? Patrick,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
this guy right here.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,280
Seriously, I just want to give a mic to

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,280
you.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
Hi guys.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,160
Thank you so much. It's been such an

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,840
honor the last 3 days. I just like

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,680
reflecting on some of the conversations

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,080
I've had. One of the conversations

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,279
really stood out to me where it was two

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,280
sisters and it was 10 years that went by

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,480
that they haven't dined together in a

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,399
restaurant because of her sister and her

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,879
chronic illness. It's stories like that

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,120
that really make me excited to

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,600
participate and be able to provide this

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,480
type of cuisine and have you guys be

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,890
able to be out in a restaurant, enjoy

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
the community.

I love Cafe Gratitude. It's like a place

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,879
I've been coming to for a long time. I

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
love the food. I don't even have to

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,160
think about the ingredients. I don't

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
have to think about whether it's bad for

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
me. It just feels so good to be able to

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
go to a place, be able to trust it. I'm

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,680
incredibly grateful for Cathic

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,000
Gratitude, the creativity that they put

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,280
into it. I want to thank Patrick. We got

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
in contact with him and said, "Hey, you

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,880
know, we have a child with special

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,040
needs. We need like a table." And he got

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
us our table. Just enjoy food together

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,640
without having to worry about how it's

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,240
going to affect us. Is amazing. It feels

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
like the best party ever.

There's a good vibe here and I think a

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,159
lot of it begins with the food at Cafe

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,320
Gratitude. Being able to metaphorically

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
break bread with your people is oh it's

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,680
so magical. I love it. Just really

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,439
amazing souls. Everybody here has gone

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
through the healing journey. So I feel

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,960
like there's just an essence of

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,200
gratitude here which is so perfect for

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,360
the place. Right. Everyone has this

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
beautiful light and is so joyous because

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
they've decided to take back the reigns

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,119
of their destiny and they're doing what

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,119
they love. And just to just hear their

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,119
stories and to share space with them has

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
been so special. and to connect with

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,040
this broader community of people who

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,039
just love being here and being in

58
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
communion with people in a world that is

59
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,920
more fragmented than ever. People here

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,760
remind me and offer me hope that the

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,040
future can continue to look more

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,280
interconnected and more peaceful and

63
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
more loving because that is what we were

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
all built to do. And it's beautiful to

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,560
share that with people. It's it's

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
unbelievable.

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,040
Just super grateful for you and we're

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,520
glad we can, you know, help the

69
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,520
community. So,

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,000
thank you so much. We love you guys so

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,000
much. Thank you.
