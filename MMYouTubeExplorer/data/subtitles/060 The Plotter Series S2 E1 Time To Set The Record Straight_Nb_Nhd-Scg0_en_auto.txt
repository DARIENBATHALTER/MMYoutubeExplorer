[1.48 - 6.12] holy [ __ ] we need to get this guy off
[4.04 - 9.00] the internet like we need to just take
[6.12 - 10.52] it all down it's like evil runs through
[9.00 - 13.16] all of us
[10.52 - 15.48] and I don't know it's just like to me
[13.16 - 17.44] that sums up the whole cuz I I'm not
[15.48 - 21.68] over here trying to pretend I'm a
[17.44 - 24.56] s go you it
[21.68 - 26.48] that's of course I've committed horrible
[24.56 - 28.28] acts but you know you didn't even have
[26.48 - 30.60] to do anything bad in your
[28.28 - 32.88] ha he's Conant
[30.60 - 36.36] watching Anthony
[32.88 - 37.64] and just grabbing every little bit of
[36.36 - 39.92] information that he thinks could be
[37.64 - 43.16] helpful to take him down and I remember
[39.92 - 44.96] one time you know I had this kind of
[43.16 - 48.24] like a I've talked about a little bit
[44.96 - 51.52] before so my my kind of my dark dark
[48.24 - 53.60] days um I felt this voice and it was
[51.52 - 55.28] like you know if you nothing else has
[53.60 - 57.24] been working for you you should kind of
[55.28 - 59.28] like thought maybe maybe you need to
[57.24 - 60.48] come work on my side it's a long story
[59.28 - 61.84] but in the nutshell
[60.48 - 63.92] there was a voice that was like you
[61.84 - 65.88] should come work for leave the light
[63.92 - 67.64] come work for the other side and I
[65.88 - 70.36] remember falling on the floor and in
[67.64 - 72.40] tears being like I will never never work
[70.36 - 75.24] for the dark like I I don't care if I'm
[72.40 - 77.80] in a wheelchair or a bed bound or die I
[75.24 - 79.76] will never switch TS and I'm telling you
[77.80 - 83.40] that moment something lifted off my
[79.76 - 86.32] chest like and then I knew I knew I was
[83.40 - 87.88] like you demon whatever is in my body I
[86.32 - 89.56] don't know what Megan's told you but it
[87.88 - 92.60] will be interesting to see what the
[89.56 - 95.32] response when this comes out you know
[92.60 - 98.52] yeah what do you think is going to
[95.32 - 99.96] happen I think there will be a parting
[98.52 - 102.40] of the Red
[99.96 - 104.12] Seas initially and I think that it will
[102.40 - 105.40] definitely ruffle some feathers and I
[104.12 - 108.72] think that there will be a large
[105.40 - 111.40] community of people who share it um I
[108.72 - 113.68] think me it's coming out VY fair so it
[111.40 - 117.16] will be widely will be widely shared
[113.68 - 120.00] yeah no matter what Amber and Anthony
[117.16 - 122.48] have no idea what's in store for them in
[120.00 - 125.48] the coming
[122.48 - 127.64] years years ago a group of people
[125.48 - 129.12] secretly teamed up and did everything
[127.64 - 131.96] they could to try to knock me out of the
[129.12 - 134.48] health space they formed a multi-step
[131.96 - 137.36] long-term plan to create a quote
[134.48 - 139.60] post-medical medium era by feeding false
[137.36 - 142.20] information to mainstream media
[139.60 - 144.80] companies anonymously like they did to
[142.20 - 147.76] Vanity Fair last year using a false
[144.80 - 150.32] story about a woman named Stephanie who
[147.76 - 152.08] passed away from cancer years ago this
[150.32 - 153.92] group thought they could destroy my
[152.08 - 156.36] reputation with a series of hitpiece
[153.92 - 159.36] Articles against me without anybody
[156.36 - 161.64] knowing who was behind it all so that
[159.36 - 164.12] they couldn't be held accountable until
[161.64 - 166.48] they reached their goal they ultimately
[164.12 - 169.20] wanted the hit pieces to lead to
[166.48 - 173.04] securing themselves a deal for an
[169.20 - 175.12] anti-ed medium documentary on Netflix
[173.04 - 177.40] and would then bring Fame and other
[175.12 - 180.28] benefits to them this group had been
[177.40 - 182.96] working on their plan for a long time
[180.28 - 185.00] secretly recruiting more people to join
[182.96 - 188.20] them along the way using false
[185.00 - 191.32] information and false stories about me
[188.20 - 193.16] but their plan was thored last year when
[191.32 - 196.52] this group tried to recruit a woman
[193.16 - 198.32] named Amber visicaro an alternative
[196.52 - 200.24] medicine practitioner who's been a part
[198.32 - 204.64] of the medical medium Community for over
[200.24 - 207.28] 7 years Amber decided to legally record
[204.64 - 210.52] her phone calls with the leaders of this
[207.28 - 212.20] group for her own protection and safy
[210.52 - 215.12] because she immediately felt that
[212.20 - 217.88] something was off she ended up capturing
[215.12 - 220.68] evidence of the identities of the main
[217.88 - 224.40] individuals behind this Sinister plot
[220.68 - 226.08] and sadly all of them no exaggeration
[224.40 - 228.96] are people who have been helped by
[226.08 - 232.32] medical medium information and even some
[228.96 - 234.32] by me personally in their Darkest Hours
[232.32 - 237.56] whether it was with their health or
[234.32 - 240.64] their career or both Amber captured
[237.56 - 242.84] evidence of this massive betrayal proof
[240.64 - 245.88] that this group is Rife with ulterior
[242.84 - 248.04] motives and has been led by individuals
[245.88 - 251.56] with Platforms in the health industry
[248.04 - 254.40] who want to take me out and a documented
[251.56 - 256.80] record of the verifiably false stories
[254.40 - 259.28] and Flatout lies they've been telling
[256.80 - 262.64] people about me to try to get them on
[259.28 - 266.08] their side her recordings serve as a
[262.64 - 269.20] record of the entire recruitment process
[266.08 - 272.56] and the recruitment tactics for example
[269.20 - 275.12] they tried to to sell Amber on the idea
[272.56 - 277.68] that she could be made famous by Vanity
[275.12 - 279.92] Fair if she turned against me and let
[277.68 - 283.04] the journalists position her as the
[279.92 - 284.56] leader of the post-medical medium era
[283.04 - 286.40] mean I I've been thinking about this for
[284.56 - 289.00] a long time like you definitely have an
[286.40 - 293.44] opportunity to be a leader in what I
[289.00 - 296.24] would call the postmed medium era and
[293.44 - 298.84] having him put you on a platform and be
[296.24 - 301.44] like a leader of this era would could be
[298.84 - 303.76] good for you Amber knew that what was
[301.44 - 306.52] happening was very wrong and instead of
[303.76 - 308.72] joining them she came on four episodes
[306.52 - 311.28] of the medical medium podcast last year
[308.72 - 313.92] and used her recordings facts and
[311.28 - 316.40] evidence to expose this group the
[313.92 - 319.24] details of their multi-step plot their
[316.40 - 322.40] malevolent and ulterior motives and the
[319.24 - 324.84] verifiably false information they'd been
[322.40 - 326.56] trying to spread and publish in order to
[324.84 - 330.08] take medical medium and the community
[326.56 - 333.56] down what we covered was appalling and
[330.08 - 337.44] shock so many of you to the core and yet
[333.56 - 339.44] there is so much more to the story this
[337.44 - 340.84] is truly one of the biggest scandals
[339.44 - 343.44] that has ever happened in the health
[340.84 - 345.48] industry as you'll see it's also one of
[343.44 - 348.44] the biggest instances of capturing
[345.48 - 350.80] corruption within the mainstream media
[348.44 - 354.00] this episode is the first in what's
[350.80 - 356.80] going to be a full-blown expose Amber
[354.00 - 358.76] vakaro is back on here with me today and
[356.80 - 361.16] she's going to be joining me in an
[358.76 - 364.08] ongoing series series of many podcast
[361.16 - 367.28] episodes in which we are going to be
[364.08 - 371.08] thoroughly exposing this group that we
[367.28 - 373.96] refer to as the plotters and dismantling
[371.08 - 376.20] their Web of Lies alterative motives and
[373.96 - 379.00] much more some of the evidence we're
[376.20 - 381.64] presenting in these episodes includes
[379.00 - 384.60] original written content such as text
[381.64 - 387.60] messages and social media posts that
[384.60 - 390.72] have been produced by the plotters and
[387.60 - 393.08] will be reenacted for greater ease in
[390.72 - 395.64] following along those who are listening
[393.08 - 397.76] to the podcast can find video versions
[395.64 - 401.08] of these episodes on the medical medium
[397.76 - 403.56] YouTube and Rumble channels that will be
[401.08 - 406.12] displaying screenshots photos videos and
[403.56 - 408.44] more Amber thank you for being here
[406.12 - 411.00] again can you start by explaining why
[408.44 - 414.12] we're back here doing this
[411.00 - 415.68] again thanks Anthony it's crazy that
[414.12 - 417.48] it's been over a year since we released
[415.68 - 420.12] the first round of podcast episodes
[417.48 - 421.88] about this group and part of me is
[420.12 - 423.40] pained by the fact that we're back here
[421.88 - 425.76] addressing this again because I know
[423.40 - 428.16] that what we all want more than anything
[425.76 - 430.28] is to be able to move on from this
[428.16 - 432.76] deranged plot and all of this group's
[430.28 - 434.56] just really dark and nasty attacks but
[432.76 - 437.28] we're back here again because even after
[434.56 - 439.88] being exposed and proven wrong last year
[437.28 - 442.28] the plotters did not stop
[439.88 - 444.04] plotting in fact they escalated their
[442.28 - 446.56] behavior significantly to the point that
[444.04 - 449.64] it's become allout expressions of
[446.56 - 451.64] Senseless hatred they took to social
[449.64 - 454.20] media and put their true intentions on
[451.64 - 457.12] display as they began terrorizing
[454.20 - 459.64] publicly attacking bullying harassing
[457.12 - 461.56] shaming and humiliating chronically ill
[459.64 - 463.36] people in the medical medium Community
[461.56 - 464.56] who are just minding their own business
[463.36 - 468.48] trying to
[464.56 - 471.20] heal this hateful group has disturbingly
[468.48 - 473.16] targeted and attacked moms and even
[471.20 - 474.96] children if someone in the community
[473.16 - 477.52] tried to defend themselves against these
[474.96 - 480.08] attacks the plotters would Gaslight them
[477.52 - 482.28] flip it around portray them eles to be
[480.08 - 484.40] the victims and label medical medium
[482.28 - 487.40] community members as being bullies when
[484.40 - 489.76] the plotters were in fact the
[487.40 - 492.24] aggressors throughout the past year this
[489.76 - 494.92] organized hateful group has issued
[492.24 - 496.80] threats toward Anthony and myself
[494.92 - 498.96] they've repeatedly expressed clear
[496.80 - 501.24] intent to harm medical medium and the
[498.96 - 503.72] community they've deliberately tried to
[501.24 - 505.20] stop Anthony from doing a free event to
[503.72 - 507.56] support and raise money for the
[505.20 - 510.60] community they've posted videos of
[507.56 - 513.16] themselves burning medical media books
[510.60 - 516.48] and they've incited for others to do the
[513.16 - 518.20] same okay all these medical medium books
[516.48 - 521.44] are going to be burned
[518.20 - 521.44] today it's
[521.96 - 525.56] happening this is going in first celery
[524.52 - 527.96] juice
[525.56 - 530.88] one I took out the insides cuz it's
[527.96 - 530.88] going to take forever to
[531.32 - 538.04] burn this is not a joke this organized
[535.48 - 540.00] hateful group has even gone as far as to
[538.04 - 542.88] issue a public statement calling for
[540.00 - 544.92] Anthony himself to be exterminated by
[542.88 - 546.44] fire if you're watching the video
[544.92 - 549.20] version of this episode you'll see a
[546.44 - 551.64] social media graphic titled Pest Control
[549.20 - 554.52] cheat sheet that has a list of options
[551.64 - 557.04] that you can use to repel or kill pests
[554.52 - 558.52] like ants and spiders you'll see that
[557.04 - 561.20] someone who has been involved with the
[558.52 - 562.80] plotters rehar it and added medical
[561.20 - 565.56] medium
[562.80 - 566.92] fire you don't have to like Anthony you
[565.56 - 568.96] don't have to like medical medium
[566.92 - 570.80] information medical medium information
[568.96 - 572.64] is always has gotten plenty of criticism
[570.80 - 574.60] because anything Leading Edge always
[572.64 - 577.24] does and there's a lot of spiritual
[574.60 - 580.36] discrimination out there this is
[577.24 - 583.16] different this is just objectively wrong
[580.36 - 585.08] and unacceptable Behavior this is a
[583.16 - 588.20] barrage of baseless attacks that are
[585.08 - 589.12] completely devoid of rationality Truth
[588.20 - 591.44] and
[589.12 - 593.60] Sanity the plotters have spent the
[591.44 - 595.56] entire past year still desperately
[593.60 - 598.52] trying to create something that doesn't
[595.56 - 600.40] exist they have pivoted so many times
[598.52 - 602.64] shifting narratives and saying anything
[600.40 - 605.32] to get a rise out of people and they've
[602.64 - 608.40] manufactured and spread an unimaginable
[605.32 - 610.32] number of New Lies they're still out
[608.40 - 612.80] there trying to get attention from media
[610.32 - 615.16] companies by playing dirty with lies and
[612.80 - 618.48] verifiably false information which is
[615.16 - 621.40] going to be thoroughly exposed in this
[618.48 - 623.64] series they continue to use and exploit
[621.40 - 625.88] deceased individuals and others in the
[623.64 - 628.84] process of trying to get what they want
[625.88 - 630.52] they continue to ignore reality they
[628.84 - 632.28] thought that they had a meal ticket
[630.52 - 634.00] because they had text messages from
[632.28 - 636.36] Anthony that they took from a deceased
[634.00 - 639.04] person's phone and manipulated to try to
[636.36 - 641.72] frame a public figure to serve their own
[639.04 - 644.00] agenda but it's too bad for them that we
[641.72 - 646.48] have all of the text and other evidence
[644.00 - 648.68] they're hiding that proves them wrong
[646.48 - 651.00] and their admissions on recording and
[648.68 - 652.92] more and we will use it all to set the
[651.00 - 655.56] record straight as many times as we need
[652.92 - 657.64] to and because their attempt to take
[655.56 - 659.80] Anthony out using their false Stephanie
[657.64 - 662.00] story was a failure and didn't get them
[659.80 - 664.56] where they wanted to be they've had to
[662.00 - 666.32] Pivot and manufacture entirely new
[664.56 - 668.24] outrageously false
[666.32 - 670.92] narratives that is why we're back here
[668.24 - 673.68] doing this again but it's all coming out
[670.92 - 676.76] this time around as you said Anthony
[673.68 - 678.76] there is so much more to this story in
[676.76 - 681.04] our previous episodes we held back on a
[678.76 - 683.32] lot out of respect for Stephanie and the
[681.04 - 684.92] family we only released what was
[683.32 - 687.64] necessary to address the false
[684.92 - 689.96] accusations at the time we also held
[687.64 - 693.12] back on a lot about the plotter
[689.96 - 694.88] purely as courtesy to them in hopes that
[693.12 - 697.16] after being proven wrong they would at
[694.88 - 700.24] the very least just
[697.16 - 703.04] stop that is very much not what has
[700.24 - 705.28] happened this organized hateful group is
[703.04 - 707.68] still trying to rewrite history they are
[705.28 - 709.92] spreading verifiably false information
[707.68 - 711.84] they are flat out lying and they are
[709.92 - 714.04] withholding and altering evidence as
[711.84 - 716.68] they try to perpetuate their false
[714.04 - 718.04] narratives so that courtesy is no longer
[716.68 - 720.48] going to be
[718.04 - 722.56] extended at at the time of my calls with
[720.48 - 724.88] the plotters I knew enough to know that
[722.56 - 727.44] what they were telling me was wrong but
[724.88 - 730.20] I have now spent the entire past year of
[727.44 - 732.80] my life thoroughly studying every detail
[730.20 - 734.72] for myself every text thread every
[732.80 - 736.60] communication with every one of the many
[734.72 - 738.92] individuals who were involved every
[736.60 - 741.04] audio every photo every video every
[738.92 - 742.44] social media post every piece of data
[741.04 - 744.44] that was submitted to us every
[742.44 - 746.56] Everything organizing it all into
[744.44 - 748.36] timelines forensically analyzing it
[746.56 - 749.80] scrutinizing the facts and running it
[748.36 - 752.52] all through fact checker and a legal
[749.80 - 755.72] team this group is in for a rude
[752.52 - 757.84] awakening we're going to be exposing
[755.72 - 759.48] everything there's a lot that's coming
[757.84 - 761.36] in these episodes and we want to prepare
[759.48 - 762.28] everyone for it by first issuing a
[761.36 - 765.68] trigger
[762.28 - 767.60] warning we understand that content about
[765.68 - 769.72] the activities of this organized hateful
[767.60 - 771.76] group can be triggering for those who
[769.72 - 775.00] have experienced serious betrayal
[771.76 - 778.04] bullying harassment emotional trauma
[775.00 - 780.20] manipulation and abuse so please take
[778.04 - 782.32] care of yourself as you listen you might

[790.52 - 794.56] to provide some shocking updates of
[792.40 - 796.68] occurrences since our last series of
[794.56 - 798.60] podcast episodes about this group as
[796.68 - 801.00] well as some important context as to how
[798.60 - 802.84] we got here today and I'm going to start
[801.00 - 806.12] by officially releasing the names of the
[802.84 - 808.16] plotters for the first time right now at
[806.12 - 810.72] this point everyone deserves to know
[808.16 - 813.32] exactly who and what they're really
[810.72 - 815.72] dealing with the number one person
[813.32 - 817.80] responsible for this plot a mountain of
[815.72 - 819.24] Lies upon lies and all of the
[817.80 - 821.80] chronically ill people who have been
[819.24 - 822.72] harmed by all of it is a woman named
[821.80 - 825.08] Ashley
[822.72 - 826.92] Foster Ashley Foster is the one you
[825.08 - 829.92] heard telling the original verifiably
[826.92 - 831.60] false story about Stephanie Ashley is
[829.92 - 834.44] the one you heard talking about how she
[831.60 - 836.40] was hoping that a director or a producer
[834.44 - 837.84] that her husband works with would be
[836.40 - 839.84] interested in doing a negative
[837.84 - 841.68] documentary about Anthony
[839.84 - 844.12] and she's the one you heard saying that
[841.68 - 846.52] because Anthony has such a presence that
[844.12 - 848.88] a Netflix documentary is her goal
[846.52 - 851.16] because then there would be no coming
[848.88 - 856.32] back from that for
[851.16 - 858.80] him um oh my
[856.32 - 864.12] um yeah we're hopeful that once the
[858.80 - 867.28] article's out um one of the directors or
[864.12 - 870.32] producers that Britain works with
[867.28 - 872.16] will uh you know become interested in
[870.32 - 874.40] telling the story really well I think
[872.16 - 878.28] it's going to take that because Anthony
[874.40 - 880.28] is so um he has such a presence and if
[878.28 - 882.72] it just stops at the article I'm
[880.28 - 884.88] guessing that like there would be some
[882.72 - 887.00] buzz in the medical medium Community for
[884.88 - 889.16] a few months but like really I think
[887.00 - 890.96] then it would kind of die down
[889.16 - 893.52] ultimately the
[890.96 - 895.72] way to really get the word out is like
[893.52 - 896.76] would be like a Netflix documentary you
[895.72 - 899.68] know
[896.76 - 901.96] so um once you hit that
[899.68 - 906.52] level of like being exposed there's kind
[901.96 - 906.52] of no there's no coming back from
[906.56 - 912.56] that Ashley is the ring leader of this
[909.76 - 914.56] organized hateful group Ashley's
[912.56 - 917.20] original false story about Stephanie is
[914.56 - 918.96] the story that was given to Vanity Fair
[917.20 - 921.32] as was reflected in the questions that
[918.96 - 923.60] were asked of Anthony the questions
[921.32 - 925.76] literally mirrored Ashley's very
[923.60 - 927.96] distinct false story and we are going to
[925.76 - 930.92] be reading those questions off in this
[927.96 - 933.96] series Ashley's story was first posted
[930.92 - 937.40] on social media in 2020 Ashley told more
[933.96 - 939.60] than 15 verifiable falsities in the
[937.40 - 942.48] comment section of that post Ashley told
[939.60 - 945.44] more than 15 additional verifiable
[942.48 - 948.24] falsities the next day Ashley posted an
[945.44 - 950.80] adapted story to her blog at the time
[948.24 - 954.00] and that version contained more than 20
[950.80 - 955.84] verifiable falsities Ashley was sent a
[954.00 - 958.24] legal letter informing her of the facts
[955.84 - 959.96] and what she was wrong about Ashley was
[958.24 - 962.56] asked to preserve a record of what she
[959.96 - 964.68] had posted but instead Ashley decided to
[962.56 - 967.04] delete all of it
[964.68 - 969.64] immediately Ashley then spent years
[967.04 - 971.32] plotting and scheming lying to people
[969.64 - 974.72] around her trying to get them on her
[971.32 - 976.48] side and against Anthony in 2022 Ashley
[974.72 - 979.68] tried to get away with taking that same
[976.48 - 981.92] false story about Stephanie from 2020 to
[979.68 - 984.52] the media so that she could hide behind
[981.92 - 987.64] anonymity as a source and therefore not
[984.52 - 989.96] be held accountable for being wrong too
[987.64 - 992.40] bad for her I CT captured her and her
[989.96 - 995.56] hateful group exposing themselves on
[992.40 - 997.56] recording last year since the article
[995.56 - 1000.40] and our podcast came out last year
[997.56 - 1002.52] Ashley has spearheaded a whole ongoing
[1000.40 - 1005.16] smear campaign against Anthony and
[1002.52 - 1007.28] medical medium information in addition
[1005.16 - 1009.16] to all of the attacks the new lies
[1007.28 - 1011.60] Ashley's been spreading all of the
[1009.16 - 1014.00] pivoting she's done and the bullying
[1011.60 - 1015.72] Ashley has also been childishly ACC
[1014.00 - 1018.40] costing people in the medical medium
[1015.72 - 1020.00] Community via DM intentionally trying to
[1018.40 - 1022.80] break them down and convince them to
[1020.00 - 1026.88] stop applying medical medium
[1022.80 - 1031.12] information hey I um just wanted to
[1026.88 - 1031.12] slide into your DMs as a little
[1032.24 - 1036.88] troublemaker after having spent years
[1034.88 - 1039.08] littering lies and false information
[1036.88 - 1041.28] about Stephanie everywhere every chance
[1039.08 - 1043.04] she could get and claiming Stephanie to
[1041.28 - 1045.40] be the reason why she started attacking
[1043.04 - 1047.92] Anthony in the first place Ashley's now
[1045.40 - 1049.44] very recently pivoted almost entirely
[1047.92 - 1051.48] away from Stephan
[1049.44 - 1053.64] and has conjured up new narratives about
[1051.48 - 1056.88] medical medium information in general
[1053.64 - 1059.32] that are even more verifiably wrong than
[1056.88 - 1060.84] her fake story about Stephanie
[1059.32 - 1062.56] throughout this series we will be
[1060.84 - 1065.12] exposing a tremendous amount of
[1062.56 - 1067.52] information about Ashley you're going to
[1065.12 - 1069.40] learn all about Ashley's true motives
[1067.52 - 1072.44] behind her desperate desire to want to
[1069.40 - 1074.68] take Anthony down and the true history
[1072.44 - 1077.96] that she's been hiding from everyone all
[1074.68 - 1079.80] this time the pathological lies Ashley
[1077.96 - 1082.84] has told all all while she's claimed to
[1079.80 - 1085.80] be perfectly honest and morally Superior
[1082.84 - 1087.68] are going to be put on display the
[1085.80 - 1090.64] fabricated stor she's been telling for
[1087.68 - 1092.16] years are going to unravel you'll learn
[1090.64 - 1094.64] about individuals who have been
[1092.16 - 1097.72] personally victimized attacked and
[1094.64 - 1099.52] belied by Ashley Ashley's clearly
[1097.72 - 1102.16] documented track record of being
[1099.52 - 1104.16] dishonest and highly inaccurate and then
[1102.16 - 1105.96] simply pivoting to the next false claim
[1104.16 - 1109.00] when caught that has been playing out
[1105.96 - 1110.60] for years is going to be uncovered
[1109.00 - 1113.36] you're going to learn just how far
[1110.60 - 1115.44] Ashley has gone with her lies what she
[1113.36 - 1117.96] had to do to get Vanity Fair to run with
[1115.44 - 1119.16] and publish their HIIT piece on Anthony
[1117.96 - 1121.96] and much
[1119.16 - 1124.04] more the number two person responsible
[1121.96 - 1126.60] for this plot and all of the chronically
[1124.04 - 1129.00] ill people who have been harmed by it as
[1126.60 - 1131.84] many of you have figured out is Robbie
[1129.00 - 1134.16] Barbaro Robbie has a health business he
[1131.84 - 1136.52] was Anthony's friend Anthony helped him
[1134.16 - 1139.56] a lot with his career and Robbie was
[1136.52 - 1142.04] also my friend Robbie St us both in the
[1139.56 - 1143.92] back Robbie lied to my face while he was
[1142.04 - 1146.20] secretly plotting to destroy medical
[1143.92 - 1148.72] medium in the community for over a year
[1146.20 - 1151.36] during our friendship all while he was
[1148.72 - 1154.32] actively using medical medium protocols
[1151.36 - 1156.36] like the heavy metal detox celery juice
[1154.32 - 1160.36] and specific medical medium recommended
[1156.36 - 1162.60] supplements himself and even asking me
[1160.36 - 1164.08] repeatedly for health advice when he was
[1162.60 - 1165.68] very clear on the fact that it was
[1164.08 - 1168.84] medical medium
[1165.68 - 1171.04] information so here he is plotting to to
[1168.84 - 1173.64] take down the medical medium Community
[1171.04 - 1177.08] while he's using the medical medium
[1173.64 - 1178.88] heavy metal detox celery juice and
[1177.08 - 1182.08] supplement protocol information to
[1178.88 - 1185.76] achieve better health for himself then
[1182.08 - 1187.60] asking Amber for help while lying to her
[1185.76 - 1190.48] and this is one of Ashley's closest
[1187.60 - 1193.76] friends and Ashley said on a recording
[1190.48 - 1195.80] that she believes there's like no one
[1193.76 - 1197.88] more trustworthy than
[1195.80 - 1201.36] Robbie but there's like no one more
[1197.88 - 1203.04] trustworthy than Robie so I know that
[1201.36 - 1207.08] whatever he shared with you it's like
[1203.04 - 1209.04] spot on Amazing prime example of who the
[1207.08 - 1211.48] plotters
[1209.04 - 1214.32] are Robbie is the one you heard
[1211.48 - 1217.16] detailing the plot and multi-step plan
[1214.32 - 1220.04] using the infamous phrase postm medal
[1217.16 - 1222.08] medium era stating that the plotter
[1220.04 - 1223.72] vision is to create a negative
[1222.08 - 1227.36] documentary about Anthony that would be
[1223.72 - 1228.88] a quote [ __ ] hit on Netflix
[1227.36 - 1230.80] describing how he had to give the
[1228.88 - 1233.76] journalist the plotter sought out a lot
[1230.80 - 1235.60] of direction for the hit piece how he
[1233.76 - 1237.88] had to hammer their narrative into the
[1235.60 - 1240.40] journalist's head how he had to point
[1237.88 - 1242.52] the journalist here and point him there
[1240.40 - 1244.00] and how he ultimately had to threaten
[1242.52 - 1245.40] the journalist to get him to move
[1244.00 - 1247.80] forward with the
[1245.40 - 1250.68] article I connected with a lot of people
[1247.80 - 1251.96] to it he really appreciated Ash and I
[1250.68 - 1253.84] and then just gave him a lot of
[1251.96 - 1256.36] direction for this piece we gave him a
[1253.84 - 1257.84] lot of clarity sort of Tor like he he
[1256.36 - 1259.12] was having a hard time wrapping his head
[1257.84 - 1261.24] around a lot of it
[1259.12 - 1264.20] like really Hammer his head like what's
[1261.24 - 1265.60] going on and like explain the details
[1264.20 - 1268.08] and point him towards this point him
[1265.60 - 1272.80] towards that but I I was upset I said
[1268.08 - 1274.48] Dam like he you are scared you're scared
[1272.80 - 1276.76] like what's going on what's the delay
[1274.48 - 1278.56] like you you have everything it's on the
[1276.76 - 1282.44] [ __ ] you have all this stuff what do
[1278.56 - 1285.28] you need and then I Bally
[1282.44 - 1287.60] threaten there is a whole lot more to
[1285.28 - 1289.64] the story with Robbie as well that again
[1287.60 - 1291.44] I held back on because I was really
[1289.64 - 1293.96] trying to avoid having to fully go there
[1291.44 - 1296.48] with all of this publicly I only shared
[1293.96 - 1299.20] what was necessary at the time but
[1296.48 - 1301.40] because Robbie instigated and enabled
[1299.20 - 1304.04] Ashley to get to where she is now that
[1301.40 - 1307.76] she uses her platform to relentlessly
[1304.04 - 1310.08] inflict harm upon the chronically ill
[1307.76 - 1312.72] because Ashley won't stop even after
[1310.08 - 1315.60] being caught lying and proven wrong with
[1312.72 - 1318.28] facts and evidence because Ashley has
[1315.60 - 1320.64] lied and lied and lied and lied some
[1318.28 - 1323.68] more and even gone as far as to portray
[1320.64 - 1325.76] Robbie as somehow being a victim in this
[1323.68 - 1328.52] situation when that could not be any
[1325.76 - 1330.32] further from reality it has become
[1328.52 - 1332.40] necessary for me to fully set the record
[1330.32 - 1334.04] straight on Robbie and I'm not holding
[1332.40 - 1337.20] back on anything in this
[1334.04 - 1339.08] series as you'll see and hear Robbie
[1337.20 - 1342.08] could not find a fact about what
[1339.08 - 1344.36] happened with Stephanie to save his life
[1342.08 - 1347.04] Robbie has exhibited zero regard for the
[1344.36 - 1349.72] actual truth in this matter Robbie
[1347.04 - 1352.04] simply used an exploit Ed Stephanie just
[1349.72 - 1354.32] like the rest of this group Robbie went
[1352.04 - 1356.48] to Great Lengths to try to take Anthony
[1354.32 - 1359.04] down for ulterior reasons which are
[1356.48 - 1360.68] going to be exposed for the first time
[1359.04 - 1363.12] and you're going to get to learn more
[1360.68 - 1365.64] about who Robbie really is behind the
[1363.12 - 1368.20] facade he portrays including his
[1365.64 - 1370.68] documented track record of disrespecting
[1368.20 - 1374.04] women and just being a shady person in
[1370.68 - 1376.76] General Robbie has deeply hurt betrayed
[1374.04 - 1379.04] and inflicted harm upon me as well as
[1376.76 - 1381.24] Anthony and this community and it's time
[1379.04 - 1383.40] for him to be held
[1381.24 - 1385.36] accountable another person who I am
[1383.40 - 1387.56] extremely disappointed to announce as
[1385.36 - 1390.76] having been involved with this plot is
[1387.56 - 1394.76] Christina cillo bugam raw Christina with
[1390.76 - 1396.76] a K from Hawaii she just like Robbie has
[1394.76 - 1399.56] a competitive Health business which can
[1396.76 - 1401.12] lend to ulterior motives Christina is
[1399.56 - 1403.96] the one you heard calling people in the
[1401.12 - 1405.96] medical medium Community vampires and
[1403.96 - 1407.56] spreading insane false rumors that she
[1405.96 - 1409.60] admittedly didn't have accurate
[1407.56 - 1412.12] information on and couldn't have cared
[1409.60 - 1414.68] any less but to spread them
[1412.12 - 1416.20] anyway Anthony that's not even his real
[1414.68 - 1420.28] name by the way I'm not sure if you know
[1416.20 - 1421.24] that it's not um it's not no it's not
[1420.28 - 1425.28] what is
[1421.24 - 1429.36] it um I don't even know I don't care
[1425.28 - 1429.36] anymore that's not his real name
[1430.12 - 1434.64] though Christina is also the one who
[1433.08 - 1437.04] said that she believed there would be a
[1434.64 - 1439.40] parting of the Red Seas after the
[1437.04 - 1442.64] hitpiece that was fed by the plotters
[1439.40 - 1445.28] about Anthony to Vanity Fair came
[1442.64 - 1447.12] out I don't know what Megan told you but
[1445.28 - 1450.04] it will be interesting to see what the
[1447.12 - 1452.76] response is when this comes out you know
[1450.04 - 1456.16] yeah what do you think is gonna
[1452.76 - 1457.40] happen I think they will be a parting of
[1456.16 - 1459.84] the Red
[1457.40 - 1461.56] Seas initially and I think that it will
[1459.84 - 1462.88] definitely ruffle some feathers and I
[1461.56 - 1466.36] think that there will be a large
[1462.88 - 1469.00] community of people who share it um I
[1466.36 - 1473.72] mean it's coming out B be fair so will
[1469.00 - 1476.92] be beely shared no matter
[1473.72 - 1479.48] what Christina spent the entirety of my
[1476.92 - 1481.48] call with her gossiping about Anthony
[1479.48 - 1483.84] and sharing a bunch of absurd rumors
[1481.48 - 1485.68] about him with me she admitted that
[1483.84 - 1487.36] she'd engaged in name calling and
[1485.68 - 1489.88] spreading rumors about Anthony around
[1487.36 - 1491.80] the island that she lives on Christina
[1489.88 - 1493.96] only said a little bit about Stephanie
[1491.80 - 1497.76] and yet every single thing she told me
[1493.96 - 1499.60] about Stephanie is provably wrong let's
[1497.76 - 1501.16] just say a lot more is going to be
[1499.60 - 1503.88] revealed in these
[1501.16 - 1506.04] episodes it was very disconcerting for
[1503.88 - 1507.96] me as I studied the recording of This
[1506.04 - 1509.68] call and compared it with all of the
[1507.96 - 1512.16] records of what actually happened with
[1509.68 - 1515.36] Stephanie in 2017 to learn that
[1512.16 - 1517.48] Christina had absolutely no clue what
[1515.36 - 1520.00] happened just like the rest of these
[1517.48 - 1521.52] people but that didn't stop Christina
[1520.00 - 1523.04] from just saying whatever terrible
[1521.52 - 1525.08] things she felt like saying about
[1523.04 - 1527.04] Anthony that didn't stop her from
[1525.08 - 1529.76] spreading rumors or from wanting to see
[1527.04 - 1531.44] him smeared in the media
[1529.76 - 1533.32] there are other individuals with health
[1531.44 - 1535.96] businesses who are behind this plot to
[1533.32 - 1538.80] take Anthony out including a woman named
[1535.96 - 1540.64] Taylor call Taylor is the one you heard
[1538.80 - 1543.08] in the previous episodes referring to
[1540.64 - 1547.40] herself and the other members of this
[1543.08 - 1550.28] hateful group as an elite category of
[1547.40 - 1553.76] people but I'm letting you know
[1550.28 - 1557.24] like we are an elite group of people we
[1553.76 - 1560.32] we're in in Elite category
[1557.24 - 1562.44] you Taylor is also the one who you heard
[1560.32 - 1565.40] saying that she had to commit horrible
[1562.44 - 1567.08] acts to get into the inner Inner Circle
[1565.40 - 1568.80] of their
[1567.08 - 1571.12] group
[1568.80 - 1573.72] so well you're not a part of it Amber
[1571.12 - 1576.40] you're in the inner Inner
[1573.72 - 1578.60] Circle and you know you have to earn
[1576.40 - 1581.60] your right to get in that Circle so
[1578.60 - 1584.04] there you go you've earned it then
[1581.60 - 1586.32] that's a rare spot to me and of course
[1584.04 - 1587.64] I've committed horrible acts but you
[1586.32 - 1590.24] know you didn't even have to do anything
[1587.64 - 1590.24] bad in your ha
[1592.20 - 1597.00] that recording gives me PTSD every time
[1594.24 - 1599.48] I hear it Taylor was Stephanie's
[1597.00 - 1601.52] caretaker that independently took charge
[1599.48 - 1603.92] of many of Stephanie's medical decisions
[1601.52 - 1606.08] when Stephanie was sick Taylor had
[1603.92 - 1608.40] significant influence over Stephanie's
[1606.08 - 1610.52] care for example when Stephanie would
[1608.40 - 1613.60] get medical testing or
[1610.52 - 1616.28] not interestingly Taylor has been
[1613.60 - 1618.24] entirely hidden and omitted from the
[1616.28 - 1619.88] stories that are told by Ashley
[1618.24 - 1622.88] Stephanie's brother and the other
[1619.88 - 1625.20] plotters about Stephanie Taylor was also
[1622.88 - 1627.32] entirely hidden and omitted from the
[1625.20 - 1630.04] Vanity Fair article even though she was
[1627.32 - 1632.08] a source that the journalists spoke to
[1630.04 - 1634.12] but now in this series you will get to
[1632.08 - 1636.08] hear the truth the facts and the
[1634.12 - 1638.28] evidence of Taylor's role in what was
[1636.08 - 1639.96] happening with Stephanie that alone
[1638.28 - 1641.80] makes the narrative the plotters tried
[1639.96 - 1644.04] to run with
[1641.80 - 1645.92] impossible when Taylor tried to tell me
[1644.04 - 1648.24] what happened with Stephanie from her
[1645.92 - 1649.76] perspective not only have I now studied
[1648.24 - 1651.96] all of the evidence that proves her
[1649.76 - 1654.04] wrong which is going to be exposed in
[1651.96 - 1656.20] this series but the number of times
[1654.04 - 1658.48] Taylor said to me on recording in
[1656.20 - 1661.92] regards to the facts of the story I
[1658.48 - 1665.40] don't know it's all a blur I can't
[1661.92 - 1667.76] remember or it doesn't matter is
[1665.40 - 1670.12] appalling I had multiple calls with
[1667.76 - 1671.92] Robbie and Taylor individually and
[1670.12 - 1674.24] together and what you're about to hear
[1671.92 - 1676.60] is just a few examples from just one of
[1674.24 - 1678.44] those calls when Taylor was explaining
[1676.60 - 1680.56] her version of the Stephanie story me
[1678.44 - 1683.08] and Robbie was chiming
[1680.56 - 1684.60] in she she' come for some kind of
[1683.08 - 1685.96] program that I can't remember as I told
[1684.60 - 1687.76] you I was looking or maybe I didn't tell
[1685.96 - 1690.84] you this I can't remember somehow I
[1687.76 - 1693.08] can't remember how um and so he called
[1690.84 - 1695.52] Stephanie and asked her if she would
[1693.08 - 1697.28] handle all that or maybe Anthony's wife
[1695.52 - 1698.92] did I can't remember there was something
[1697.28 - 1701.12] a dis I can't remember exactly what he
[1698.92 - 1703.96] said but the bottom line was he told her
[1701.12 - 1706.84] she need to light lay flat and not move
[1703.96 - 1709.00] so somehow I managed which I can't even
[1706.84 - 1712.00] remember how I had to get a nurse there
[1709.00 - 1714.04] to give her blood test and the blood
[1712.00 - 1716.64] didn't show up I can't remember but
[1714.04 - 1718.52] there was things that were off um I
[1716.64 - 1720.12] maybe it was the liver enzymes and you
[1718.52 - 1723.56] know I don't know but I don't remember
[1720.12 - 1723.56] it's all blur so
[1724.24 - 1728.76] um and a lot of it is a blur for me and
[1727.24 - 1730.68] I don't remember exactly what you wrote
[1728.76 - 1734.84] but at some point you know I was in
[1730.68 - 1737.60] touch with him um directly and I don't
[1734.84 - 1739.04] know the timeline like again I don't
[1737.60 - 1740.52] know the time this is all just a blur to
[1739.04 - 1742.36] me what the [ __ ] was it doesn't even
[1740.52 - 1745.40] matter all right well whatever but you
[1742.36 - 1746.96] know whatever you know whatever fine
[1745.40 - 1751.12] whatever she had the L okay you know
[1746.96 - 1752.60] these things Escape me sometimes um well
[1751.12 - 1754.52] escapes me at the moment yeah there was
[1752.60 - 1758.44] something
[1754.52 - 1758.44] else is it a week I
[1759.60 - 1764.92] can't when you take a story to a
[1762.68 - 1767.60] mainstream Media company about somebody
[1764.92 - 1769.92] who died with the expressed intent of
[1767.60 - 1773.92] causing harm to somebody else's
[1769.92 - 1776.28] reputation it's all a blur I don't know
[1773.92 - 1779.84] I don't know the timeline these things
[1776.28 - 1782.84] Escape me sometimes it doesn't matter is
[1779.84 - 1784.96] all completely and entirely
[1782.84 - 1786.56] unacceptable on calls that I had with
[1784.96 - 1788.80] Robbie and Taylor together they were
[1786.56 - 1790.36] even arguing with each other about
[1788.80 - 1792.28] critical details that they couldn't even
[1790.36 - 1794.16] keep straight and that neither one of
[1792.28 - 1797.04] them ended up being accurate
[1794.16 - 1798.88] about also pause real quick that there
[1797.04 - 1801.80] PR all this there was
[1798.88 - 1804.28] also where her health was what happened
[1801.80 - 1806.64] in this last month was developing for
[1804.28 - 1809.04] years okay and there was a time when she
[1806.64 - 1810.48] was in LA and you can hear this from Ash
[1809.04 - 1814.04] when when you talk to Ash Amber
[1810.48 - 1816.12] hopefully you do um her her nipples were
[1814.04 - 1819.16] bleeding no no her nipples didn't start
[1816.12 - 1821.20] bleeding until she had a lump and she
[1819.16 - 1823.36] asked Anthony about the lump and he said
[1821.20 - 1825.28] it was okay yeah but this is this is
[1823.36 - 1827.48] long before long before exactly but they
[1825.28 - 1830.44] didn't start bleeding until she was in
[1827.48 - 1832.08] Pennsylvania so she was I don't know ask
[1830.44 - 1834.80] whatever fine whatever she had the lump
[1832.08 - 1838.40] okay she had the lump
[1834.80 - 1840.64] okay there is so much to unpack in just
[1838.40 - 1843.16] this audio alone that we're going to do
[1840.64 - 1844.40] more thoroughly later on in this series
[1843.16 - 1846.28] but basically they're talking about
[1844.40 - 1848.04] Stephanie's breast lump Robbie is trying
[1846.28 - 1851.00] to claim that Stephanie's nipples
[1848.04 - 1853.64] started bleeding a year before Stephanie
[1851.00 - 1855.20] discovered her breast lump in 2017 and
[1853.64 - 1859.40] instead during a time that Stephanie
[1855.20 - 1860.68] stayed nights with Ashley in LA in 2016
[1859.40 - 1863.44] which doesn't even make sense and is
[1860.68 - 1866.08] provably wrong as we unpacked in a
[1863.44 - 1868.24] previous episode one of Stephanie's
[1866.08 - 1872.04] nipples not both started bleeding on
[1868.24 - 1874.84] October 15th of 2017 it's documented in
[1872.04 - 1877.60] text messages it happened 6 months after
[1874.84 - 1879.40] Stephanie discovered her breast lump 6
[1877.60 - 1881.12] months after Anthony and his wife
[1879.40 - 1884.72] immediately told Stephanie to get her
[1881.12 - 1886.60] lump assessed by her physician 6 months
[1884.72 - 1888.36] after Stephanie had been telling the
[1886.60 - 1890.64] both of them that she was under the care
[1888.36 - 1891.76] of a doctor for her breast lump but in
[1890.64 - 1894.56] fact was
[1891.76 - 1896.52] not Robbie said this though because
[1894.56 - 1898.32] Ashley's original false story about
[1896.52 - 1900.24] Stephanie included reference to that
[1898.32 - 1903.08] short time in
[1900.24 - 1904.64] 2016 Ashley's told so many fake stories
[1903.08 - 1907.32] about Stephanie that he's getting them
[1904.64 - 1909.92] confused and has no idea what he's
[1907.32 - 1913.12] talking about that's why he's saying ask
[1909.92 - 1915.44] Ash I hope you talk to Ash Taylor tries
[1913.12 - 1916.72] to correct Robbie and says no no no
[1915.44 - 1918.64] Stephanie's nipples didn't start
[1916.72 - 1921.48] bleeding until after after she had the
[1918.64 - 1924.04] lump a year after the timeline you're
[1921.48 - 1927.16] talking about she was in Pennsylvania
[1924.04 - 1929.20] not la which is true but then Taylor
[1927.16 - 1932.00] added in a huge falsity that comes
[1929.20 - 1934.08] directly and exactly from Ashley's
[1932.00 - 1936.68] original false story about Stephanie
[1934.08 - 1938.48] that is a lie that we've addressed and
[1936.68 - 1939.48] that we're going to debunk even further
[1938.48 - 1942.28] in this
[1939.48 - 1944.36] series Robbie gets palpably upset that
[1942.28 - 1947.04] he was challenged by Taylor when he was
[1944.36 - 1948.36] literally wrong about one of the most
[1947.04 - 1950.44] basic facts
[1948.36 - 1953.92] of the timeline and then they both just
[1950.44 - 1957.16] resort to I don't know ask Ash they're
[1953.92 - 1959.16] also both saying nipples as in plural
[1957.16 - 1961.68] just like Ashley did in her original
[1959.16 - 1964.44] false story when really it was only one
[1961.68 - 1966.36] nipple that bled even the article
[1964.44 - 1967.56] accurately described it as only being
[1966.36 - 1971.48] one
[1967.56 - 1973.88] nipple Taylor and Robbie are both wrong
[1971.48 - 1976.64] very wrong they're both referencing
[1973.88 - 1979.28] Ashley's story they're both confused
[1976.64 - 1983.00] they're deferring to Ashley and Ashley
[1979.28 - 1986.24] is more wrong than any of them this is
[1983.00 - 1988.84] why Ashley's original false story about
[1986.24 - 1991.36] Stephanie from 2020 still matters
[1988.84 - 1993.44] greatly it is what all of these people
[1991.36 - 1996.08] have clearly been brainwashed with all
[1993.44 - 1998.44] these years and it is what they're still
[1996.08 - 2000.04] going off of to this day in these
[1998.44 - 2002.64] upcoming episodes you're going to see
[2000.04 - 2004.68] that they've had to manipulate and mold
[2002.64 - 2006.72] cherry-picked and otherwise altered
[2004.68 - 2008.68] messages to fit what they could try to
[2006.72 - 2011.24] piece together from Ashley's original
[2008.68 - 2014.44] false storyline while they've hidden all
[2011.24 - 2017.56] of the evidence that proves her and them
[2014.44 - 2020.12] wrong somehow Ashley has been positioned
[2017.56 - 2022.20] by this group as the leader and the
[2020.12 - 2024.96] ultimate Authority on
[2022.20 - 2027.76] Stephanie as will become extensively
[2024.96 - 2030.16] clear in these episodes Ashley is far
[2027.76 - 2032.08] from a valid Authority on Stephanie or
[2030.16 - 2034.68] really much else for that
[2032.08 - 2036.96] matter another individual with a health
[2034.68 - 2039.92] business involved with this group is a
[2036.96 - 2041.28] woman named Gretchen manzer Gretchen is
[2039.92 - 2042.68] the one who you heard saying that there
[2041.28 - 2044.40] were statements she had made to the
[2042.68 - 2046.08] journalist that she didn't fully stand
[2044.40 - 2048.56] behind
[2046.08 - 2051.08] 100% Gretchen is also the one who you
[2048.56 - 2053.08] heard commenting on how strange it was
[2051.08 - 2056.16] that what suddenly turned Robbie against
[2053.08 - 2058.56] Anthony years and years after Stephanie
[2056.16 - 2060.56] passed away was when he suddenly watched
[2058.56 - 2062.80] the documentary that Ashley's husband
[2060.56 - 2065.72] was the cinematographer for which was
[2062.80 - 2068.56] about a fugitive and an ex con who
[2065.72 - 2070.20] committed actual crimes and had nothing
[2068.56 - 2072.88] to do with
[2070.20 - 2076.60] Anthony it was funny when Robbie had
[2072.88 - 2078.84] like the realization after she met we're
[2076.60 - 2082.44] like welcome Robbie like where have you
[2078.84 - 2084.72] been you know but yeah it's so weird how
[2082.44 - 2087.36] for him it just like it's like the Click
[2084.72 - 2091.28] of a finger you know did you watch that
[2087.36 - 2093.60] documentary I did yeah yeah um but I I
[2091.28 - 2095.72] heard that like Sarma feels really
[2093.60 - 2099.36] misrepresented like she doesn't feel
[2095.72 - 2102.96] like that it was
[2099.36 - 2106.28] how she wanted her story to be told yeah
[2102.96 - 2108.96] interesting um yeah but it's so funny
[2106.28 - 2113.60] how he watched that and
[2108.96 - 2117.40] then like it just all clicked into
[2113.60 - 2119.68] place as you just heard again this was a
[2117.40 - 2121.96] documentary they expressed using as a
[2119.68 - 2124.32] model for what they wanted to do to
[2121.96 - 2127.24] Anthony and Gretchen says here that the
[2124.32 - 2129.96] very documentary they revered as a model
[2127.24 - 2133.20] is one that a main subject feels really
[2129.96 - 2135.12] misrepresented by as Gretchen was
[2133.20 - 2137.24] telling me her version of the Stephanie
[2135.12 - 2139.20] story she admitted that it was hard for
[2137.24 - 2140.80] her to keep all of the facts and
[2139.20 - 2143.16] timelines
[2140.80 - 2146.88] straight and
[2143.16 - 2149.12] um it just it just took me so long and
[2146.88 - 2151.60] sorry the story is kind of it's just so
[2149.12 - 2154.48] many layers and components and timelines
[2151.60 - 2157.04] and it's hard to get it all
[2154.48 - 2159.24] straight during my calls with this group
[2157.04 - 2160.96] that Robbie organized and prompted me to
[2159.24 - 2164.08] engage him by the way not the other way
[2160.96 - 2166.36] around Robbie was so boastful about this
[2164.08 - 2168.48] plot and what he had done that he was
[2166.36 - 2170.96] just spewing information and divulging
[2168.48 - 2172.92] details to me left and right completely
[2170.96 - 2176.24] unprovoked one of the details he
[2172.92 - 2177.88] divulged was a ranked list he spouted
[2176.24 - 2180.48] off of who in the group was most
[2177.88 - 2182.60] responsible for the Vanity Fair hit
[2180.48 - 2184.32] piece I I will definitely take
[2182.60 - 2186.08] responsibility for one I've been one of
[2184.32 - 2188.16] the people that's been pushing for this
[2186.08 - 2190.32] if you want to take the list people of
[2188.16 - 2194.16] why this article's coming out and why
[2190.32 - 2196.28] it's coming out in a um mainstream
[2194.16 - 2198.40] publication is number one Ash is the
[2196.28 - 2200.68] number one responsible I would be number
[2198.40 - 2202.64] two Tony would be number three and Megan
[2200.68 - 2205.68] would be number four it was us four who
[2202.64 - 2205.68] like decided this needs to
[2205.88 - 2211.12] happen as you just heard Robbie named
[2208.84 - 2214.08] Tony as the number three person
[2211.12 - 2216.84] responsible for the plot Tony is
[2214.08 - 2218.80] Stephanie's brother Tony has admitted
[2216.84 - 2220.76] that he's in charge of Stephanie's phone
[2218.80 - 2223.32] and he's therefore responsible for all
[2220.76 - 2226.12] of the content that has been manipulated
[2223.32 - 2228.60] Twisted hidden and otherwise distorted
[2226.12 - 2231.04] to try to frame Anthony and coordinate
[2228.60 - 2233.76] with Ashley's original false
[2231.04 - 2236.08] story for example you're going to learn
[2233.76 - 2238.64] in this series that Dan Adler the
[2236.08 - 2240.84] journalist spent an entire year writing
[2238.64 - 2243.08] about Stephanie based on what was said
[2240.84 - 2246.00] and provided to him by Tony and the
[2243.08 - 2248.08] other plotters yet Dan did not know that
[2246.00 - 2250.00] Anthony and his wife had texted
[2248.08 - 2253.08] Stephanie and said that she should
[2250.00 - 2255.96] always see a physician for her breast
[2253.08 - 2257.64] lump right away the very next day right
[2255.96 - 2259.80] after Stephanie first discovered her
[2257.64 - 2262.96] lump in March of
[2259.80 - 2265.52] 2017 Dan remains completely unaware of
[2262.96 - 2267.32] this critical text message that in and
[2265.52 - 2269.64] of itself disproved the narrative the
[2267.32 - 2272.48] plotter sold him on all throughout his
[2269.64 - 2275.44] writing process as was reflected in
[2272.48 - 2277.84] Dan's initial questions to Anthony there
[2275.44 - 2280.24] is documented evidence that Dan was
[2277.84 - 2282.16] entirely unaware of this critical text
[2280.24 - 2283.52] message as well as a lot of other
[2282.16 - 2286.52] critical evidence that should have been
[2283.52 - 2288.44] on Stephanie's phone for a whole year
[2286.52 - 2290.80] all the way up until Dan first reached
[2288.44 - 2293.88] out to Anthony about the article and
[2290.80 - 2295.56] Anthony had to be the one to inform him
[2293.88 - 2298.12] but Dan didn't reach out for Anthony's
[2295.56 - 2300.52] side until right before Dan was planning
[2298.12 - 2303.44] on publishing his hit piece and had
[2300.52 - 2305.32] already formed the story Anthony had to
[2303.44 - 2307.56] be the one to inform Dan that he had the
[2305.32 - 2309.84] entire narrative wrong and was missing
[2307.56 - 2312.48] critical evidence but only had the
[2309.84 - 2314.72] opportunity to do so in response to Dan
[2312.48 - 2317.88] sending Anthony hundreds and hundreds of
[2314.72 - 2321.80] clearly biased questions with a deadline
[2317.88 - 2325.08] of five days to respond to after Dan had
[2321.80 - 2327.92] already invested a year of his time into
[2325.08 - 2330.88] the other side and their false
[2327.92 - 2332.76] story there's a good chance that most
[2330.88 - 2335.28] likely Dan would have dropped the
[2332.76 - 2337.04] article if he knew earlier on that the
[2335.28 - 2339.56] day after Stephanie found the breast
[2337.04 - 2342.08] lump that my wife and I told Stephanie
[2339.56 - 2344.16] that she should always see a physician
[2342.08 - 2346.72] if Dan knew this it would have been a
[2344.16 - 2349.92] shocker because he was also told the
[2346.72 - 2352.56] same old Ashley lie which was that I
[2349.92 - 2354.96] never told Steph to see a doctor but Dan
[2352.56 - 2357.68] was too deep into the article too much
[2354.96 - 2360.68] time and money had been invested and Dan
[2357.68 - 2363.72] was buried in Ashley Foster's falsities
[2360.68 - 2366.16] and lies and everybody had a save face
[2363.72 - 2368.88] and just put an article
[2366.16 - 2371.80] out and that doesn't even scratch the
[2368.88 - 2374.00] surface of what Tony is culpable for
[2371.80 - 2376.60] hiding and distorting in efforts to
[2374.00 - 2379.04] rewrite history portray a narrative that
[2376.60 - 2381.92] doesn't exist in reality and frame
[2379.04 - 2384.16] Anthony to get a documentary deal all of
[2381.92 - 2387.20] which is going to be thoroughly exposed
[2384.16 - 2389.88] in this series Tony is the one you heard
[2387.20 - 2391.36] Robbie insulting and describing as being
[2389.88 - 2394.12] lowc
[2391.36 - 2398.76] conscious Tony might be tough because
[2394.12 - 2401.00] he's he's a he's not a he's not a uh
[2398.76 - 2403.56] conscious I wouldn't say as an involved
[2401.00 - 2406.72] Soul as we
[2403.56 - 2408.04] are Robbie also describe Tony as not
[2406.72 - 2410.48] being
[2408.04 - 2412.28] levelheaded Tony Tony could be a little
[2410.48 - 2415.48] bit more on the edge he might not be so
[2412.28 - 2417.76] levelheaded but everybody else have
[2415.48 - 2420.52] levelheaded if the plotters are saying
[2417.76 - 2422.44] that Tony is not levelheaded that's
[2420.52 - 2425.04] really saying
[2422.44 - 2427.40] something next up is a woman named Megan
[2425.04 - 2429.72] Elizabeth who Robbie identified as being
[2427.40 - 2432.96] the number four person most responsible
[2429.72 - 2434.80] for this plot Megan outed Tony for
[2432.96 - 2437.40] having multiple fake accounts that he
[2434.80 - 2438.96] uses to stalk and spy on the medical
[2437.40 - 2440.92] medium
[2438.96 - 2442.88] Community it's interesting to see how
[2440.92 - 2444.52] his inner circle handles it too like I'm
[2442.88 - 2447.40] not always paying attention to that
[2444.52 - 2450.88] stuff but Tony has
[2447.40 - 2453.68] like other profiles that he's in these
[2450.88 - 2456.80] groups and he watches what they're
[2453.68 - 2459.12] saying we have since observed this group
[2456.80 - 2461.68] using fake accounts to try to influence
[2459.12 - 2463.64] public opinion spread lies across the
[2461.68 - 2466.20] internet and make it look like they have
[2463.64 - 2469.12] more support than they actually do this
[2466.20 - 2472.44] is far from the behavior of honest
[2469.12 - 2475.32] people with an honest story to tell
[2472.44 - 2477.76] Megan also outed Tony for constantly
[2475.32 - 2479.12] watching Anthony and wanting to take
[2477.76 - 2481.84] Anthony
[2479.12 - 2483.72] down I mean
[2481.84 - 2488.40] there
[2483.72 - 2491.24] yeah I mean Tony's like
[2488.40 - 2493.64] he's been Relentless about this like
[2491.24 - 2495.28] since stuff passed like just you know we
[2493.64 - 2498.52] have to do something about this and he's
[2495.28 - 2502.04] constantly watching Anthony
[2498.52 - 2503.36] and just grabbing every little bit of
[2502.04 - 2506.64] information that he thinks could be
[2503.36 - 2506.64] helpful to take him
[2506.92 - 2512.12] down and Megan is also the one you heard
[2510.20 - 2514.52] in previous episodes saying we need to
[2512.12 - 2515.88] get this guy off the internet and just
[2514.52 - 2519.20] take it all
[2515.88 - 2521.36] down holy [ __ ] we need to get this guy
[2519.20 - 2523.12] off the internet like we need to just
[2521.36 - 2525.88] take it all
[2523.12 - 2528.32] down Megan has been working with Tony on
[2525.88 - 2530.64] this for a long time trying to use
[2528.32 - 2532.92] cherry-picked contents on a deceased
[2530.64 - 2535.60] person's phone who's no longer here to
[2532.92 - 2538.36] speak for herself so that they can craft
[2535.60 - 2540.60] false story lines that frame Anthony
[2538.36 - 2543.72] when we spoke last year Megan claimed to
[2540.60 - 2546.04] have seen everything on Stephanie's
[2543.72 - 2547.44] phone I've listened to her entire phone
[2546.04 - 2549.32] listen to all their voice messages back
[2547.44 - 2552.24] and
[2549.32 - 2554.44] forth yet when Megan described her
[2552.24 - 2556.12] version of the Stephanie story to me I
[2554.44 - 2557.40] really listened with an open mind and
[2556.12 - 2559.32] wanted to understand where she was
[2557.40 - 2561.64] coming from but it quickly became
[2559.32 - 2564.36] abundantly clear that Megan just like
[2561.64 - 2567.00] the rest of this hateful group had no
[2564.36 - 2569.24] idea what she was talking about she was
[2567.00 - 2571.84] wishy-washy and confused about every
[2569.24 - 2574.16] detail and she even got the most basic
[2571.84 - 2576.20] key facts of the story
[2574.16 - 2579.60] wrong I can't remember if it was skin
[2576.20 - 2582.32] stuff or what it was yeah um I don't
[2579.60 - 2583.52] know that she really ever went to see a
[2582.32 - 2585.72] doctor when she started working with
[2583.52 - 2587.96] Anthony
[2585.72 - 2590.08] see I can't remember if he recommended
[2587.96 - 2592.60] the chiropractor or if she suggested it
[2590.08 - 2594.24] and then it never turned out or
[2592.60 - 2597.28] something
[2594.24 - 2600.00] um I'm trying to
[2597.28 - 2600.88] remember I think so when it was just a
[2600.00 - 2603.60] back
[2600.88 - 2606.24] injury
[2603.60 - 2608.96] um I'm trying to remember if there was
[2606.24 - 2612.84] like any push for a doctor at that point
[2608.96 - 2615.60] um I can't remember if it was the same
[2612.84 - 2618.48] um can't remember the other people okay
[2615.60 - 2620.60] so I can't remember this woman's name um
[2618.48 - 2623.64] but I don't I don't remember exactly
[2620.60 - 2625.64] what it was um definitely Taylor all the
[2623.64 - 2627.56] time I don't know how much she was
[2625.64 - 2629.08] keeping up with Robie at the time Taylor
[2627.56 - 2630.60] like I don't know if she flew out there
[2629.08 - 2632.48] right away or what happened but I didn't
[2630.60 - 2634.48] know what that name I didn't know
[2632.48 - 2636.44] recognize the name and I don't know if
[2634.48 - 2638.40] stuff was on that call I don't know if
[2636.44 - 2639.84] she was saying he's saying it's not true
[2638.40 - 2642.12] or she was saying it was not true as
[2639.84 - 2645.68] you're going through the timeline
[2642.12 - 2647.28] of of everyone's story there's so much
[2645.68 - 2649.92] happening and it's hard to keep track of
[2647.28 - 2649.92] what happened
[2650.24 - 2657.52] when there is so much wrong with all of
[2654.36 - 2659.40] this too it's ridiculous Stephanie was
[2657.52 - 2661.88] not working with Anthony as a client
[2659.40 - 2663.84] first of all the most concerning thing
[2661.88 - 2667.64] here is Megan saying that she doesn't
[2663.84 - 2670.20] know if Stephanie saw a doctor when
[2667.64 - 2672.60] there is evidence all over Stephanie's
[2670.20 - 2674.16] text threads demonstrating that while
[2672.60 - 2676.76] Stephanie made the decision to avoid
[2674.16 - 2678.60] seeing a doctor for her breast lump even
[2676.76 - 2680.92] after Anthony and his wife repeatedly
[2678.60 - 2683.68] encouraged her to do so Stephanie was
[2680.92 - 2685.80] seeing multiple doctors for her back
[2683.68 - 2689.00] injury and other concurrent health
[2685.80 - 2691.60] problems it's one of the most key facts
[2689.00 - 2693.16] of the entire story for somebody who
[2691.60 - 2695.36] said that they've seen everything on
[2693.16 - 2698.64] Stephanie's phone that level of
[2695.36 - 2700.92] ignorance is highly problematic IC as a
[2698.64 - 2702.76] reminder my recorded call with Megan and
[2700.92 - 2705.04] my recorded calls with the other sources
[2702.76 - 2707.56] for the article took place after the
[2705.04 - 2709.24] article had already been written and
[2707.56 - 2712.64] right before it was
[2709.24 - 2714.56] published at that stage the article was
[2712.64 - 2717.20] already done and they still couldn't get
[2714.56 - 2720.68] anything right they got every key fact
[2717.20 - 2722.88] so painfully and provably wrong Megan
[2720.68 - 2724.52] like Gretchen at least admitted that she
[2722.88 - 2726.48] was confused and that all of the
[2724.52 - 2729.36] different text threads and timelines
[2726.48 - 2732.56] were hard for her to keep track of how
[2729.36 - 2735.16] dare you be that uncertain on what
[2732.56 - 2736.76] happened with Stephanie yet so sure that
[2735.16 - 2738.52] all the work that Anthony has done to
[2736.76 - 2742.00] help and support the chronically ill for
[2738.52 - 2743.60] decades should be taken down how dare
[2742.00 - 2745.76] you take a story that you're that
[2743.60 - 2747.84] uncertain about and text messages that
[2745.76 - 2750.36] you admittedly don't even understand or
[2747.84 - 2753.04] have organized to a media company to
[2750.36 - 2755.28] smear someone a story that they
[2753.04 - 2757.84] admittedly had to hammer into the head
[2755.28 - 2759.28] of the journalist because even he was
[2757.84 - 2761.80] having a hard time wrapping his head
[2759.28 - 2764.28] around a lot of it as Robbie said a
[2761.80 - 2766.68] story that they had to biasedly shape by
[2764.28 - 2768.84] pointing him here and pointing him there
[2766.68 - 2771.96] and that they had to threaten him to get
[2768.84 - 2774.28] him to publish Megan was right about one
[2771.96 - 2775.96] thing though there is a lot going on
[2774.28 - 2778.28] with all of Stephanie's text threads
[2775.96 - 2780.08] that document what was happening and
[2778.28 - 2783.68] that is why we're going to be here for a
[2780.08 - 2786.56] long time unpacking it all factually and
[2783.68 - 2788.20] all of the other data that we have Tony
[2786.56 - 2791.32] has had access to Stephanie's phone
[2788.20 - 2794.92] since before she passed away in 2018 and
[2791.32 - 2796.92] now for nearly 6 years since Megan has
[2794.92 - 2799.80] been a part of this with Tony and has
[2796.92 - 2803.28] had access to the phone again for a long
[2799.80 - 2805.04] long time there is no excuse for any of
[2803.28 - 2807.72] the plotters being as ignorant as they
[2805.04 - 2810.88] are still to this day to the facts and
[2807.72 - 2813.08] the evidence we've now spent the past
[2810.88 - 2815.96] year doing the homework that this group
[2813.08 - 2819.08] was not willing to do to get it right
[2815.96 - 2821.76] it's so quick and easy to hurl out lies
[2819.08 - 2824.36] and misinformation to cherry-pick and
[2821.76 - 2826.16] misappropriate text messages and to say
[2824.36 - 2828.08] what you feel like about somebody
[2826.16 - 2830.60] whereas it takes a lot of time and
[2828.08 - 2832.92] energy to be factually correct to get it
[2830.60 - 2835.72] right and to prove this unbelievably
[2832.92 - 2838.88] diluted hateful group wrong with
[2835.72 - 2841.92] evidence but we are going to do it time
[2838.88 - 2845.40] and time again as often as we need
[2841.92 - 2846.56] to of course when people pass away
[2845.40 - 2848.16] sometimes there are loved ones who have
[2846.56 - 2850.68] a hard time accepting what really
[2848.16 - 2853.56] happened and want to find someone to
[2850.68 - 2855.88] blame in fact there's a documented
[2853.56 - 2858.12] record of one of the plotters admitting
[2855.88 - 2860.60] in years past that they believed this
[2858.12 - 2863.52] whole thing to stem from Tony looking
[2860.60 - 2866.20] for someone to blame but there's no
[2863.52 - 2869.12] excuse for manipulating and hiding
[2866.20 - 2871.96] evidence to try to rewrite history frame
[2869.12 - 2874.20] someone and smear them online and in the
[2871.96 - 2876.96] media and none of this would have played
[2874.20 - 2880.32] out this way or have been taken this far
[2876.96 - 2884.84] if it weren't for Ashley and
[2880.32 - 2884.84] Robbie so let me to
[2885.56 - 2892.84] you and to be honest um again 100%
[2889.28 - 2895.08] transparent Ash and I in being the two
[2892.84 - 2896.84] people that taught like Tony and Megan
[2895.08 - 2900.32] had with the [ __ ] right the whole
[2896.84 - 2902.52] podcast thing was just dumb so dumb um
[2900.32 - 2904.04] we had to kind of like educate them and
[2902.52 - 2906.84] convince them he this is a better route
[2904.04 - 2908.88] to go and then just text with us four
[2906.84 - 2911.80] kind of funny back in the day but
[2908.88 - 2916.96] anyways um the intention and action I
[2911.80 - 2919.36] had is that it's going a Netflix series
[2916.96 - 2922.28] like bad vegan will be made about
[2919.36 - 2925.04] Anthony and it will be a [ __ ] hit
[2922.28 - 2928.92] because what he pulled off is
[2925.04 - 2930.80] unbelievable I the celebrity angle like
[2928.92 - 2933.16] this thing this Netflix version is gonna
[2930.80 - 2935.80] go boners it's gonna take many many
[2933.16 - 2937.88] years to get there I mean I mean to to
[2935.80 - 2940.20] produce like that tastes years but it'll
[2937.88 - 2941.48] still be just like the bad Deegan thing
[2940.20 - 2943.76] like how many years ago did that whole
[2941.48 - 2946.08] thing actually happened versus like when
[2943.76 - 2950.52] the the movie came out or the or the
[2946.08 - 2953.40] Netflix came out like this is this gonna
[2950.52 - 2955.76] happen holy
[2953.40 - 2958.36] [ __ ] there's going to be a documentary
[2955.76 - 2960.24] about it all that's our vision I mean
[2958.36 - 2962.88] it's not we first get to publish the
[2960.24 - 2965.16] article and then once the article is
[2962.88 - 2969.96] published then people start bidding on
[2965.16 - 2973.32] the piece so just you know again um I
[2969.96 - 2975.88] guess um The Hills article I just sent
[2973.32 - 2979.80] you yeah is being made into a
[2975.88 - 2981.44] documentary okay so Dan Adler and this
[2979.80 - 2985.48] whole whole Vanity Fair people they have
[2981.44 - 2988.04] a history of producing something that is
[2985.48 - 2992.32] you know well done you know done well
[2988.04 - 2995.44] enough to um be turned into um a
[2992.32 - 2997.68] documentary of some sort holy [ __ ] he's
[2995.44 - 3000.16] GNA look real bad it's going to look
[2997.68 - 3000.16] real
[3000.48 - 3006.96] bad this is what they tried to recruit
[3003.20 - 3008.12] me with the promise of a big Netflix
[3006.96 - 3011.32] documentary
[3008.12 - 3013.52] deal these main plotters have recruited
[3011.32 - 3015.36] others to join them over the years and
[3013.52 - 3017.64] there are other individuals involved
[3015.36 - 3020.80] that will be exposed throughout this
[3017.64 - 3022.44] series and then we have Dan Adler who
[3020.80 - 3023.96] really should be called a plotter too at
[3022.44 - 3026.12] this point because we have so much
[3023.96 - 3028.56] evidence that we're going to release of
[3026.12 - 3031.44] just how deeply he was in cahoots with
[3028.56 - 3033.60] this group Dan is the writer at Vanity
[3031.44 - 3036.08] Fair that the plotter specifically
[3033.60 - 3038.72] sought out to do this hit piece with the
[3036.08 - 3040.76] premeditated goal from day one of It
[3038.72 - 3045.00] ultimately leading to a documentary deal
[3040.76 - 3046.84] for them on June 1st of last year a
[3045.00 - 3049.44] couple weeks after the article and our
[3046.84 - 3052.68] podcast episodes came out Dan Adler did
[3049.44 - 3055.52] a very unusual very brief 21-minute
[3052.68 - 3058.12] interview as a guest on a small podcast
[3055.52 - 3059.84] that sole Focus us is criticizing and
[3058.12 - 3063.16] disparaging people in the health and
[3059.84 - 3066.80] wellness industry further proving Dan's
[3063.16 - 3069.60] bias shockingly again after the article
[3066.80 - 3071.92] was published Dan admitted in this
[3069.60 - 3073.52] interview that he was confused about
[3071.92 - 3075.16] everything he had written about
[3073.52 - 3077.24] regarding
[3075.16 - 3079.56] Anthony but I think one thing that also
[3077.24 - 3080.72] came across in the text messages that I
[3079.56 - 3083.84] reported on and many of the
[3080.72 - 3085.40] conversations I had with sources is that
[3083.84 - 3087.20] a lot of it is just very confusing
[3085.40 - 3089.32] there's a lot of information being
[3087.20 - 3091.16] conveyed there's a lot of jargon being
[3089.32 - 3092.56] used there are lots of supplements
[3091.16 - 3094.80] talking to sources about their
[3092.56 - 3096.00] interpretation of the information more
[3094.80 - 3098.04] than anything else I think there's just
[3096.00 - 3100.40] a lot of confusion there's a lot of the
[3098.04 - 3102.56] sense of if I could just understand
[3100.40 - 3104.52] what's being conveyed through this
[3102.56 - 3106.40] figure who's portraying himself as as I
[3104.52 - 3109.28] say in the story just under God I could
[3106.40 - 3110.60] just understand what the message is that
[3109.28 - 3112.08] would help me but when you try to look
[3110.60 - 3115.08] at what the message is it's very very
[3112.08 - 3115.08] murky
[3116.68 - 3121.04] that is
[3118.28 - 3122.92] something from a journalist first I from
[3121.04 - 3124.80] a journalist exactly from the journalist
[3122.92 - 3127.32] that had already written the piece he's
[3124.80 - 3129.20] confused about everything and first I
[3127.32 - 3132.04] have to address what Dan said in here
[3129.20 - 3134.68] about how he wrote in his hit piece that
[3132.04 - 3138.56] Anthony portrays himself to be just
[3134.68 - 3140.60] under God Anthony has absolutely never
[3138.56 - 3143.24] said that he is just under God and he
[3140.60 - 3145.84] does not portray himself in that way
[3143.24 - 3147.84] that is an Ashley Foster talking point
[3145.84 - 3150.28] that she has been misappropriating and
[3147.84 - 3153.40] mischaracterizing Anthony with for years
[3150.28 - 3155.40] to serve her own agenda clearly that
[3153.40 - 3157.44] must have been one of the many things
[3155.40 - 3160.28] that Ashley and Robbie had to give Dan
[3157.44 - 3162.04] Direction on and Hammer into his head as
[3160.28 - 3165.52] that is not something that Anthony has
[3162.04 - 3167.72] ever said or published not once
[3165.52 - 3170.00] apparently Dan didn't properly research
[3167.72 - 3172.28] or fact check his work and just adopted
[3170.00 - 3174.68] provably false narratives from this
[3172.28 - 3176.80] group
[3174.68 - 3179.64] secondly he said that what he was
[3176.80 - 3181.72] reporting on was just very confusing and
[3179.64 - 3184.32] he thinks there's just a lot of
[3181.72 - 3186.40] confusion yeah Dan your sources were
[3184.32 - 3188.72] confused and that's why it was confusing
[3186.40 - 3190.64] to you too and they were confused
[3188.72 - 3192.88] because they didn't know the story of
[3190.64 - 3194.80] what really happened and because Ashley
[3192.88 - 3197.60] Foster has been lying about it so much
[3194.80 - 3200.52] since day one and if what was being
[3197.60 - 3203.88] presented to Dan seemed that murky and
[3200.52 - 3205.44] was really all that confusing why on
[3203.88 - 3207.44] Earth would he go through with
[3205.44 - 3210.72] publishing an article on a story that he
[3207.44 - 3213.16] was that unclear on or at least why on
[3210.72 - 3215.12] Earth spend a whole year writing a story
[3213.16 - 3216.80] you're uncertain about and then only
[3215.12 - 3217.64] reach out to Anthony after it's already
[3216.80 - 3220.44] been
[3217.64 - 3222.36] formed I would imagine that to be
[3220.44 - 3225.08] because Dan like many journalists these
[3222.36 - 3228.20] days was not really interested in the
[3225.08 - 3230.96] truth so you've got this crazy toxic and
[3228.20 - 3233.08] unprecedented combination of a brother
[3230.96 - 3234.64] who's looking for someone to blame
[3233.08 - 3236.80] sources who don't even know what
[3234.64 - 3238.96] happened admittedly can't keep track of
[3236.80 - 3241.08] the timeline and don't have their fact
[3238.96 - 3243.40] straight you've got a journalist who's
[3241.08 - 3245.24] admittedly confused and still to this
[3243.40 - 3248.40] day doesn't even understand the subject
[3245.24 - 3250.76] matter he wrote about sources and a
[3248.40 - 3253.40] journalist that are all relying on
[3250.76 - 3255.96] Ashley Foster as the ultimate Authority
[3253.40 - 3258.12] on Stephanie when Ashley as you'll learn
[3255.96 - 3260.80] in the series was not around for what
[3258.12 - 3262.76] happened with Stephanie at all
[3260.80 - 3264.60] admittedly barely even spoke to
[3262.76 - 3267.20] Stephanie during the time period that
[3264.60 - 3270.36] this is all about in 2017 has been
[3267.20 - 3272.36] caught flat out lying about Stephanie
[3270.36 - 3274.16] and the original conjured up story
[3272.36 - 3276.88] Ashley posted that they're all still
[3274.16 - 3279.44] running with to this day had dozens of
[3276.88 - 3282.20] verifiable falsities in it including the
[3279.44 - 3283.92] one you heard Robbie and Taylor repeat
[3282.20 - 3285.80] and that's why Ashley scrubbed it from
[3283.92 - 3286.76] the internet when she got a legal letter
[3285.80 - 3289.60] in
[3286.76 - 3292.52] 2020 you've got a journalist who was
[3289.60 - 3294.84] somehow conveniently unaware of the text
[3292.52 - 3296.76] messages that were on Stephanie's phone
[3294.84 - 3299.12] that disproved the entire narrative he
[3296.76 - 3302.08] was sold on for the whole year he spent
[3299.12 - 3305.20] writing his story you've got sources
[3302.08 - 3307.40] that expressly want to take Anthony down
[3305.20 - 3309.72] have a vested interest in being part of
[3307.40 - 3312.08] getting a Netflix documentary deal
[3309.72 - 3313.80] sources that also have other documented
[3312.08 - 3315.88] ulterior motives that are going to be
[3313.80 - 3318.80] uncovered for the first time in these
[3315.88 - 3321.00] episodes a journalist that has a vested
[3318.80 - 3324.48] interest in securing a big Netflix
[3321.00 - 3327.24] documentary deal using his story sources
[3324.48 - 3329.44] who admitted to shaping the article
[3327.24 - 3332.72] themselves by giving the journalist a
[3329.44 - 3335.44] lot of direction for the piece having to
[3332.72 - 3338.20] hammer their narrative into his head
[3335.44 - 3341.72] Point him here and point him there and
[3338.20 - 3345.32] threaten him to get him to publish it if
[3341.72 - 3348.88] there were ever a perfect recipe for
[3345.32 - 3351.36] corruption and dishonesty this would be
[3348.88 - 3353.12] it again this is one of the biggest
[3351.36 - 3355.08] scandals that has ever happened in the
[3353.12 - 3357.92] health industry this group has been
[3355.08 - 3361.12] using abusing and exploiting Stephanie's
[3357.92 - 3363.12] name and Legacy as a means to an end
[3361.12 - 3366.28] this was certainly never about the truth
[3363.12 - 3368.88] for them if you're confused you do not
[3366.28 - 3370.56] get to fill in the gaps as you want to
[3368.88 - 3372.84] if you can't get the facts or the
[3370.56 - 3375.16] timeline straight you're not in a valid
[3372.84 - 3377.88] position to tell a story let alone to
[3375.16 - 3380.68] take it to a media company if you're
[3377.88 - 3382.52] unaware of even the most basic key facts
[3380.68 - 3384.60] of what really happened you have
[3382.52 - 3387.44] absolutely no business perpetuating a
[3384.60 - 3389.28] story that you don't understand
[3387.44 - 3391.80] they tried to get away with lying and
[3389.28 - 3393.60] getting it wrong using Anthony's name
[3391.80 - 3395.88] they try to get away with lying and
[3393.60 - 3397.88] getting it wrong using Stephanie's name
[3395.88 - 3400.48] to serve their own agenda because she's
[3397.88 - 3402.92] not here to speak for herself they try
[3400.48 - 3405.00] to get away with grossly misrepresenting
[3402.92 - 3408.08] medical medium and the community to
[3405.00 - 3411.32] serve their own agenda and none of it is
[3408.08 - 3414.36] going to stand lies inaccurate
[3411.32 - 3417.00] information plotting and scheming will
[3414.36 - 3420.16] only ever get you so far
[3417.00 - 3421.88] and the full actual truth is coming out
[3420.16 - 3425.00] in this
[3421.88 - 3426.92] series so Dan the journalist published
[3425.00 - 3428.72] his hit piece we came out with our first
[3426.92 - 3431.00] few podcast episodes that began the
[3428.72 - 3432.56] process of exposing the corruption and
[3431.00 - 3435.52] collusion that took place between the
[3432.56 - 3437.88] media company and the plotters an we
[3435.52 - 3439.92] began to expose the plotter ulterior
[3437.88 - 3442.72] motives their goal from the beginning
[3439.92 - 3444.48] was not to Simply put their version of a
[3442.72 - 3447.72] story out there that they beli to be
[3444.48 - 3450.32] true their goal was categorically to
[3447.72 - 3453.52] take medical medium and the community
[3450.32 - 3455.60] down the response to the podcasts was
[3453.52 - 3457.32] massive and I just want to issue a huge
[3455.60 - 3458.96] thank you to everyone for all of the
[3457.32 - 3461.60] support we have received through all of
[3458.96 - 3464.24] the craziness so many people were
[3461.60 - 3467.12] devastated by the fact that the plotters
[3464.24 - 3470.40] could be so intentionally poisonous to
[3467.12 - 3472.52] go so low as to use a manipulated story
[3470.40 - 3474.64] of a deceased woman to try to injure a
[3472.52 - 3477.12] community of people who were just trying
[3474.64 - 3479.20] to heal I read through many comments
[3477.12 - 3481.76] from people who were shocked and
[3479.20 - 3484.32] outraged by the voices they recognized
[3481.76 - 3487.00] as being behind this the fact that
[3484.32 - 3490.92] something so dark is coming from people
[3487.00 - 3493.24] who portray themselves to be very
[3490.92 - 3494.96] different there were also a lot of
[3493.24 - 3497.88] people who came forward to share their
[3494.96 - 3500.28] own experiences with the plotters one of
[3497.88 - 3501.72] them is a woman named Melody Pence who
[3500.28 - 3504.00] has been applying medical medium
[3501.72 - 3506.40] information for several years and knew
[3504.00 - 3508.44] some of the plotters personally
[3506.40 - 3510.72] following the release of our first ever
[3508.44 - 3512.48] podcast about this group Melody took to
[3510.72 - 3514.84] her Instagram stories to share about
[3512.48 - 3517.56] attempts that were made to recruit her
[3514.84 - 3520.80] including even before Ashley came out
[3517.56 - 3523.96] with her original false story in
[3520.80 - 3526.28] 2020 so when I listened to the podcast I
[3523.96 - 3527.96] could not believe what I was hearing as
[3526.28 - 3530.84] you guys could not believe what you were
[3527.96 - 3534.40] hearing either and what I recognized
[3530.84 - 3536.84] right away was Robbie barbaro's voice so
[3534.40 - 3538.48] clear I mean it's a voice that
[3536.84 - 3540.56] um if you know him if you talk to him if
[3538.48 - 3542.12] you've been around him you're going to
[3540.56 - 3545.16] pick up on his voice it's a very
[3542.12 - 3548.36] distinctive voice and what I knew Robbie
[3545.16 - 3551.24] as is someone who is very charismatic on
[3548.36 - 3554.36] the outside seemed like a pure genuine
[3551.24 - 3557.92] soul to me I looked up to him I thought
[3554.36 - 3561.04] he was an amazing person um and so when
[3557.92 - 3562.04] I heard him talking like that on the
[3561.04 - 3564.88] medical
[3562.04 - 3568.20] medium uh podcast that Anthony just
[3564.88 - 3571.64] released I I saw his true colors and it
[3568.20 - 3574.88] was shocking it was shocking to realize
[3571.64 - 3577.04] that someone that you thought um was a
[3574.88 - 3578.28] good person and had so much Prisma on
[3577.04 - 3581.68] the outside and portrayed that they
[3578.28 - 3584.12] wanted to help others is not like that
[3581.68 - 3586.16] honestly it was it was so shocking that
[3584.12 - 3591.08] it took me like a full day to like
[3586.16 - 3594.08] recover from that and and um and and and
[3591.08 - 3596.40] what's interesting about Robbie is he
[3594.08 - 3598.28] comes off as such a positive vibe been
[3596.40 - 3602.08] wanting to help people but something
[3598.28 - 3607.80] that I brought up um in my last stories
[3602.08 - 3609.56] was when I met Robbie in gosh 2016 I'm
[3607.80 - 3615.24] not sure when it was when Anthony did
[3609.56 - 3617.60] his event in LA and um and I uh I was
[3615.24 - 3621.04] there I got interviewed by Robbie and I
[3617.60 - 3623.68] remember he told me at one point he said
[3621.04 - 3626.24] um you know just focus on the food focus
[3623.68 - 3629.08] on the food and it's like when he said
[3626.24 - 3631.16] that I felt a lack of compassion because
[3629.08 - 3634.16] I he had just interviewed me about my
[3631.16 - 3637.60] story the strugg struggles I'd been
[3634.16 - 3639.36] through um and you know I had a lot of
[3637.60 - 3641.72] failures a lot of heartbreak and then to
[3639.36 - 3644.24] hear just focus on the food to just
[3641.72 - 3647.12] focus on the food for my Instagram right
[3644.24 - 3649.52] that I pretty sure that's that's exactly
[3647.12 - 3652.12] what he was saying like he didn't he
[3649.52 - 3654.80] didn't really just he didn't want to
[3652.12 - 3657.96] hear about like someone's struggles or
[3654.80 - 3659.72] pain exactly was just like yeah focus on
[3657.96 - 3662.12] the food which is crazy cuz that's not
[3659.72 - 3663.88] even what the chronically ill is about
[3662.12 - 3666.04] and he does help chronically ill people
[3663.88 - 3669.84] he helps people with diabetes you know
[3666.04 - 3675.12] and so right there is just a red flag of
[3669.84 - 3678.96] lacking compass and also speaking of um
[3675.12 - 3681.00] this Elite group right um and being
[3678.96 - 3683.80] recruited that they talk about in the
[3681.00 - 3688.84] video my nose is just so bad right now
[3683.80 - 3691.48] but um um I I remember right let's see
[3688.84 - 3694.92] when shortly after he moved to Miami in
[3691.48 - 3696.64] 2020 when Co happened I all of a sudden
[3694.92 - 3699.64] like noticed that he was watching my
[3696.64 - 3702.24] stories and I was like why like that's
[3699.64 - 3705.04] weird like we follow each other but um
[3702.24 - 3706.48] he never communicates with me I don't
[3705.04 - 3707.84] communicate with him and then all of a
[3706.48 - 3710.96] sudden one day he was just watching my
[3707.84 - 3714.00] stories a lot then I get a DM from him
[3710.96 - 3717.92] completely unexpected and it basically
[3714.00 - 3720.24] is inviting me to go to Miami and stay
[3717.92 - 3722.84] at his house that he has a guest bedroom
[3720.24 - 3725.08] blah blah blah um this and that and I
[3722.84 - 3727.12] was just like hm that's weird and in my
[3725.08 - 3729.92] gut feeling at that time I was like well
[3727.12 - 3733.16] this isn't a romantic interest like what
[3729.92 - 3735.24] does he want you know what I mean and
[3733.16 - 3737.04] and now looking back it all makes sense
[3735.24 - 3740.76] it all makes sense that they were
[3737.04 - 3743.40] recruiting people um someone dm' me
[3740.76 - 3746.16] yesterday and said that uh they did his
[3743.40 - 3748.44] program and that they've been around him
[3746.16 - 3750.44] before and that he always has females
[3748.44 - 3752.76] coming in and out of his house he's
[3750.44 - 3756.00] always surrounded by females and it's
[3752.76 - 3758.84] that's odd right thank God I didn't go
[3756.00 - 3760.40] and um but now I realize it it could
[3758.84 - 3763.12] have been because he was trying to
[3760.40 - 3765.64] recruit me and turn me against mm which
[3763.12 - 3770.04] would never happen so I found out about
[3765.64 - 3774.44] Ashley Foster through um one I just I
[3770.04 - 3777.08] knew that things were getting weird with
[3774.44 - 3778.96] this group and I'm about to go into this
[3777.08 - 3783.52] um Ashley's
[3778.96 - 3787.64] group and like a couple years ago um
[3783.52 - 3790.68] gosh in 2018 when I moved back to Hawaii
[3787.64 - 3793.68] um Gretchen lived there she invited me
[3790.68 - 3796.04] over um I didn't I don't think I
[3793.68 - 3798.36] realized before I went to her house how
[3796.04 - 3800.48] against mm she was I was just going
[3798.36 - 3803.28] there to like meet a familiar face cuz
[3800.48 - 3806.36] Gretchen was a part of reclaimers of
[3803.28 - 3809.20] Health in 2016
[3806.36 - 3812.16] 17 so I still thought maybe oh maybe
[3809.20 - 3815.00] like she's still doing mm you know
[3812.16 - 3818.04] whatever so anyways I go to her house
[3815.00 - 3821.56] and she tries to she talks to me about
[3818.04 - 3824.24] how bad Anthony is how bad mm is and
[3821.56 - 3827.40] basically trying to turn me against mm
[3824.24 - 3829.96] well I never saw her again after that we
[3827.40 - 3832.16] lived on the same island I I never
[3829.96 - 3834.32] contacted her nothing it was just such a
[3832.16 - 3837.08] turn off to me and the other thing that
[3834.32 - 3839.32] she was talking about was Ashley and
[3837.08 - 3842.16] basically referring to Ashley as if
[3839.32 - 3844.76] she's some type of idol some type of God
[3842.16 - 3846.52] because Gretchen worshiped her I mean
[3844.76 - 3849.40] she did sorry Gretchen if you're seeing
[3846.52 - 3852.56] this but you did and like everything
[3849.40 - 3854.88] Ashley did was amazing and and and
[3852.56 - 3856.08] Ashley was the one that had a heavy
[3854.88 - 3860.32] influence on
[3856.08 - 3862.48] Gretchen and made Gretchen like really
[3860.32 - 3864.68] not like mm so much so what does that
[3862.48 - 3867.28] say and here now we're seeing her
[3864.68 - 3869.92] resurface and a couple years ago
[3867.28 - 3872.32] Ashley's Instagram got shut down because
[3869.92 - 3875.88] she was blaming Anthony for her friend's
[3872.32 - 3880.68] death um verbally announcing it on
[3875.88 - 3886.32] Instagram and everything and and now she
[3880.68 - 3890.76] is and what's crazy is Ashley um was at
[3886.32 - 3893.48] the um the mm event in La the same T
[3890.76 - 3896.12] place I met Robbie I knew they were good
[3893.48 - 3897.92] friends cuz they just stuck to each
[3896.12 - 3901.08] other and hung out together the entire
[3897.92 - 3904.36] time Ashley's husband was doing the
[3901.08 - 3905.96] video for interviewing people he was the
[3904.36 - 3910.12] cameraman when he when Robbie
[3905.96 - 3913.04] interviewed me okay and so this is just
[3910.12 - 3916.48] comes full circle you know what I mean
[3913.04 - 3919.80] um o my blood's starting to boil so
[3916.48 - 3922.76] anyways um also in the p real quick in
[3919.80 - 3925.20] the podcast they talk about how they
[3922.76 - 3927.76] have someone that can do the video well
[3925.20 - 3930.68] guess who you think that is I mean I'm
[3927.76 - 3933.72] just speaking for my own intuition here
[3930.68 - 3935.64] but come on like I'm sure it's her
[3933.72 - 3938.72] husband recording for the documentary I
[3935.64 - 3942.08] don't know but that's thing and I
[3938.72 - 3944.60] remember when I saw Ashley I was excited
[3942.08 - 3946.60] to meet her cuz she had a lot of what
[3944.60 - 3951.32] seemed like light about her she was
[3946.60 - 3953.04] Smiley happy just seemed so like nice
[3951.32 - 3958.12] but then what I realized is when I met
[3953.04 - 3961.40] her excuse me um she like really didn't
[3958.12 - 3963.24] hardly even say hi to me anything I mean
[3961.40 - 3965.72] and then I realized she's like that with
[3963.24 - 3967.52] her friends she's like that with her
[3965.72 - 3969.96] friends cuz I was like Oh I thought she
[3967.52 - 3971.72] was so nice like okay and then I just
[3969.96 - 3974.28] see her with her circle of friends and I
[3971.72 - 3975.52] was like hm and that was my f that was
[3974.28 - 3978.12] my first
[3975.52 - 3981.80] impression but she will play the victim
[3978.12 - 3983.88] card very well very well so don't get
[3981.80 - 3987.72] fooled by who knows who the three
[3983.88 - 3990.84] younger recruits are h M so who knows
[3987.72 - 3992.92] but um I wanted to share everything with
[3990.84 - 3995.20] y'all and I'm not done yet but I wanted
[3992.92 - 3997.52] to share everything with y'all so you
[3995.20 - 3999.92] could gather the information too and
[3997.52 - 4001.92] just see like okay what's going on here
[3999.92 - 4007.16] you know
[4001.92 - 4008.80] and and uh during that time is just when
[4007.16 - 4011.72] I started realizing there was a whole
[4008.80 - 4014.44] bunch of group of people against mm um
[4011.72 - 4016.04] simply because who knows why they're not
[4014.44 - 4018.76] happy
[4016.04 - 4020.20] so Robbie's in the on the podcast and
[4018.76 - 4023.92] then of course ra
[4020.20 - 4026.04] Christina um she says The Parting of the
[4023.92 - 4029.44] Red Seas that is
[4026.04 - 4034.16] disgusting that is disgusting she is
[4029.44 - 4036.92] someone who preaches spiritualism who
[4034.16 - 4039.84] preaches peace and love and happiness
[4036.92 - 4042.92] and healing and health and then she's
[4039.84 - 4045.12] behind this directly orchestrating how
[4042.92 - 4049.08] she's going to take down mm are you
[4045.12 - 4052.04] kidding me and the reason I know this is
[4049.08 - 4054.40] because if you have followed her if you
[4052.04 - 4057.00] have watched many of her YouTube videos
[4054.40 - 4059.84] if you were a follower of her trying to
[4057.00 - 4062.96] heal then you will recognize her voice
[4059.84 - 4067.36] when you listen closely so baffling to
[4062.96 - 4071.00] me is these people right that
[4067.36 - 4074.04] are have high high following numbers
[4071.00 - 4078.28] who's supposed to be what they come off
[4074.04 - 4079.80] as to help people get healthy and well
[4078.28 - 4081.68] they want to wipe out the chronically
[4079.80 - 4084.44] ill
[4081.68 - 4086.76] community so you want to wipe out people
[4084.44 - 4090.08] that you are actually pretending that
[4086.76 - 4092.48] you help so if you're about green juices
[4090.08 - 4094.84] and fruits and vegetables and people
[4092.48 - 4096.56] getting their health back you don't
[4094.84 - 4098.32] really care if you're going to try to
[4096.56 - 4102.00] take down an entire
[4098.32 - 4105.64] community that is Sinister I've also
[4102.00 - 4107.80] gotten um so many messages from you guys
[4105.64 - 4110.32] and some of you guys have said Taylor is
[4107.80 - 4112.44] in the video the one that says oh I have
[4110.32 - 4115.28] to do really really bad things to get
[4112.44 - 4120.24] here that's three people Robbie
[4115.28 - 4123.60] Christina five and either Taylor Britney
[4120.24 - 4126.20] or someone else and again this is just
[4123.60 - 4128.84] from what I've seen in my personal
[4126.20 - 4131.16] experience who I've talked to personally
[4128.84 - 4134.40] how it evolved for me was through
[4131.16 - 4138.68] Gretchen um and and yeah since then it's
[4134.40 - 4140.92] just I've had a huge a awareness about
[4138.68 - 4144.80] people trying to take down mm because of
[4140.92 - 4147.04] what's happened so I hope this clears is
[4144.80 - 4150.16] clears things up and I'm super tired cuz
[4147.04 - 4152.48] I have so much brain fog but let me know
[4150.16 - 4155.88] okay you guys want to know like what
[4152.48 - 4158.00] else I think is so um Sinister about
[4155.88 - 4160.56] this people that are called first of all
[4158.00 - 4162.20] they call themselves Elite so what does
[4160.56 - 4164.72] that tell you you know what I mean the
[4162.20 - 4167.92] only person that Elite is Elite to me is
[4164.72 - 4171.48] God um in Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[4167.92 - 4173.52] and that is a huge red flag number one
[4171.48 - 4177.12] that they're calling themselves Elite
[4173.52 - 4180.24] that's just that should be enough that's
[4177.12 - 4182.40] enough for me right there and then the
[4180.24 - 4184.36] thing is is that they're saying oh I had
[4182.40 - 4186.24] to do you have to do bad things to get
[4184.36 - 4187.84] into this group and then she's talking
[4186.24 - 4190.44] to Amber oh but you didn't have to do
[4187.84 - 4192.88] anything and you're here hah and it's
[4190.44 - 4194.68] like what does that sound like yeah that
[4192.88 - 4197.48] sounds like a cult to me that sounds
[4194.68 - 4200.24] like um something that you have to be a
[4197.48 - 4204.20] part of that's Elite that you have to do
[4200.24 - 4208.20] bad things to join and it sounds very
[4204.20 - 4210.20] very dark to me what about you you guys
[4208.20 - 4213.96] you know honestly what that made me
[4210.20 - 4215.72] think of once I got over the shock of
[4213.96 - 4218.28] I'm still in shock of Who's involved
[4215.72 - 4222.28] honestly but it's it's just so crystal
[4218.28 - 4227.32] clear that um yeah I mean now I know who
[4222.28 - 4227.32] these people are so the shock is lifting
[4228.32 - 4233.64] and then a couple days later after our
[4230.60 - 4237.48] second episode came out Melody posted
[4233.64 - 4240.80] this but I've been online um and seen
[4237.48 - 4243.28] some people like just really talking
[4240.80 - 4245.48] crap about medical medium and it's just
[4243.28 - 4247.00] really not cool it's it's really not
[4245.48 - 4249.92] cool it's
[4247.00 - 4251.96] like I'm going to be straight up and
[4249.92 - 4254.28] because I'm exhausted and I'm just a
[4251.96 - 4257.56] person that doesn't have really a lot of
[4254.28 - 4261.76] filter these days cuz I am working my
[4257.56 - 4265.20] ass off and I'm fried so here I go um
[4261.76 - 4267.96] but you know people that want to talk
[4265.20 - 4270.36] [ __ ] and talk like bad about somebody
[4267.96 - 4273.28] who's doing something amazing have
[4270.36 - 4276.04] nothing going on in their lives there's
[4273.28 - 4279.76] a lack of faith on this planet that is
[4276.04 - 4282.32] so massive that and so many people have
[4279.76 - 4284.12] trauma and like things that have
[4282.32 - 4286.16] happened to them that they want to blame
[4284.12 - 4289.04] someone for and instead of looking
[4286.16 - 4292.12] within and like you know fixing their
[4289.04 - 4294.28] own life they have to like try to bring
[4292.12 - 4297.40] someone else
[4294.28 - 4299.20] down later on in this series more is
[4297.40 - 4301.44] going to be shared about Melody's
[4299.20 - 4303.60] experiences which very much align with
[4301.44 - 4306.60] my own experiences with this
[4303.60 - 4309.00] group as the content and evidence from
[4306.60 - 4312.24] all the upcoming episodes unfolds you're
[4309.00 - 4314.08] going to see just how spot-on Melody is
[4312.24 - 4317.28] especially about the dynamic of this
[4314.08 - 4320.00] group how they worship and idolize
[4317.28 - 4322.68] Ashley Foster and the influence that
[4320.00 - 4325.32] Ashley specifically has had upon them
[4322.68 - 4327.40] turning against medical medium over the
[4325.32 - 4330.60] years and the other thing that she was
[4327.40 - 4332.52] talking about was Ashley and basically
[4330.60 - 4335.48] referring to Ashley as if she's some
[4332.52 - 4338.04] type of idol some type of God because
[4335.48 - 4339.64] Gretchen worshiped her I mean she did
[4338.04 - 4342.68] sorry Gretchen if you're seeing this but
[4339.64 - 4346.04] you did and like everything Ashley did
[4342.68 - 4348.80] was amazing and and and Ashley was the
[4346.04 - 4353.16] one that had a heavy influence on
[4348.80 - 4355.68] Gretchen and made Gretchen like really
[4353.16 - 4358.84] not like mm so
[4355.68 - 4362.40] much you're going to see that Ashley has
[4358.84 - 4365.16] been lying and plotting and scheming for
[4362.40 - 4366.64] years for ulterior reasons while
[4365.16 - 4369.88] pretending to be a
[4366.64 - 4373.40] whistleblower Ashley so badly wanted to
[4369.88 - 4375.40] position herself as a leader and a guru
[4373.40 - 4378.44] and get attention for that under the
[4375.40 - 4380.64] guise of being an advocate on top of the
[4378.44 - 4383.08] lies and falsi she's already been caught
[4380.64 - 4385.00] telling as well as the many more lies
[4383.08 - 4387.72] and falsities of hers that are going to
[4385.00 - 4389.56] be exposed in these episodes one of the
[4387.72 - 4391.96] biggest giveaways that Ashley is
[4389.56 - 4394.80] completely disingenuous is the fact that
[4391.96 - 4398.24] she has now spent the entire past year
[4394.80 - 4401.36] relentlessly belittling harassing body
[4398.24 - 4403.48] shaming name calling and attacking the
[4401.36 - 4406.36] very people she claims to be advocating
[4403.48 - 4408.60] for the chronically ill
[4406.36 - 4410.76] Ashley got sloppy and put her true
[4408.60 - 4414.08] character and intentions on public
[4410.76 - 4416.12] display which is purely to cause harm to
[4414.08 - 4418.20] Anthony and the medical medium community
[4416.12 - 4419.60] and there is no low that she won't stoop
[4418.20 - 4423.24] to in her
[4419.60 - 4425.52] efforts any journalist or Media company
[4423.24 - 4428.36] that takes Ashley Foster and her
[4425.52 - 4431.96] organized hateful group seriously is a
[4428.36 - 4435.08] joke and a sham anyone who platforms a
[4431.96 - 4437.76] group that is lying spewing hatred
[4435.08 - 4440.92] burning books and calling for another
[4437.76 - 4442.36] human being to be exterminated by fire
[4440.92 - 4444.68] is
[4442.36 - 4447.00] Despicable and Melody wasn't the only
[4444.68 - 4448.76] one with the story to share a lot of
[4447.00 - 4450.72] people have come forward with all kinds
[4448.76 - 4453.16] of information and evidence which will
[4450.72 - 4455.60] be discussed throughout these upcoming
[4453.16 - 4457.96] episodes last year following the release
[4455.60 - 4459.96] of the previous podcast episodes there
[4457.96 - 4462.56] was also something really suspicious
[4459.96 - 4465.20] that occurred immediately after the
[4462.56 - 4468.08] episodes were released my computer which
[4465.20 - 4471.24] of course had the recordings on it was
[4468.08 - 4473.88] hacked I have never in my life had
[4471.24 - 4475.64] anything like that happened prior but
[4473.88 - 4477.60] all of the sudden right after our
[4475.64 - 4479.92] podcast started coming out one night I
[4477.60 - 4481.92] was sitting at my desk about a foot away
[4479.92 - 4484.72] from the computer using my phone while
[4481.92 - 4487.00] my desktop computer screen was idle
[4484.72 - 4488.92] suddenly out of the corner of my eye I
[4487.00 - 4491.00] noticed that something had taken over my
[4488.92 - 4493.68] computer and a bunch of my files were
[4491.00 - 4495.40] being pulled up at lightning speed I
[4493.68 - 4496.96] realized that somebody had hacked into
[4495.40 - 4500.44] my computer and was looking through my
[4496.96 - 4502.28] files extremely rapidly my gut reaction
[4500.44 - 4504.60] was to just shut down and unplug the
[4502.28 - 4506.28] computer immediately and thankfully I
[4504.60 - 4508.64] learned later that that's exactly what
[4506.28 - 4511.40] you're supposed to do in that situation
[4508.64 - 4513.60] as it removes a hacker's access I was
[4511.40 - 4514.64] able to catch and interrupt the attempt
[4513.60 - 4518.32] right
[4514.64 - 4520.60] away now hacking into someone's computer
[4518.32 - 4523.24] is obviously not only a privacy
[4520.60 - 4525.60] violation but it's also massively
[4523.24 - 4527.16] illegal and it says everything about the
[4525.60 - 4529.44] character and the desperation of the
[4527.16 - 4532.56] person who did it or had someone do it
[4529.44 - 4534.48] for them I had to get a new computer and
[4532.56 - 4536.28] I had to replace other devices like my
[4534.48 - 4539.68] phone that were compromised by the
[4536.28 - 4541.24] Hacked Wi-Fi and I had to move because I
[4539.68 - 4543.56] no longer felt comfortable living where
[4541.24 - 4545.12] I was living I consulted with some
[4543.56 - 4547.16] experts and I was told that you have to
[4545.12 - 4549.32] know someone's location in order to hack
[4547.16 - 4551.80] them like that so it easily could have
[4549.32 - 4554.20] happened again can't say for sure who
[4551.80 - 4555.84] did it yet but one of the plotters knew
[4554.20 - 4558.08] where I lived
[4555.84 - 4559.80] I've had Specialists investigating the
[4558.08 - 4563.00] situation and supporting me with
[4559.80 - 4565.72] security on my new devices it seems to
[4563.00 - 4567.36] me like someone wanted those recordings
[4565.72 - 4570.68] really
[4567.36 - 4573.60] badly the recordings serve as critical
[4570.68 - 4575.52] evidence of the identity of the plotters
[4573.60 - 4577.92] because their whole plan was to go
[4575.52 - 4580.24] through with this anonymously and
[4577.92 - 4582.56] conceal their identities so that they
[4580.24 - 4585.24] couldn't be held accountable for the
[4582.56 - 4588.44] false information they were using the
[4585.24 - 4591.40] media to spread they serve as critical
[4588.44 - 4594.36] evidence of the plot's own ranking
[4591.40 - 4596.84] system of the top people who are most
[4594.36 - 4600.00] responsible for the plot and the
[4596.84 - 4602.72] recordings serve as critical evidence of
[4600.00 - 4605.52] the malicious intentions behind the
[4602.72 - 4608.04] plotters the verifiably false
[4605.52 - 4611.60] information that they've tried to use to
[4608.04 - 4613.92] recruit people the recruitment tactics
[4611.60 - 4615.48] the verifiably false information they
[4613.92 - 4618.72] fed to the media
[4615.48 - 4620.80] as well as a very serious corruption and
[4618.72 - 4623.20] collusion between the plotters and the
[4620.80 - 4626.08] media company that they sold false
[4623.20 - 4628.20] stories too and there's so much more
[4626.08 - 4630.12] from the recordings that we are going to
[4628.20 - 4634.08] be
[4630.12 - 4636.04] releasing yes and as such Ashley and the
[4634.08 - 4638.60] other plotters did everything that they
[4636.04 - 4641.72] could to try to discredit the recordings
[4638.60 - 4644.04] and the podcast episodes but it's really
[4641.72 - 4646.40] hard to walk yourself out of what you
[4644.04 - 4649.20] said in your own
[4646.40 - 4651.80] words after the podcast came out Ashley
[4649.20 - 4653.80] started behaving very erratically she
[4651.80 - 4655.84] kept frantically changing her profile
[4653.80 - 4658.44] over and over again she called Anthony
[4655.84 - 4661.24] and I both obnoxious names she kept
[4658.44 - 4663.64] posting and deleting things she issued a
[4661.24 - 4667.60] statement that she was quote proud to be
[4663.64 - 4669.88] a plotter and then she deleted it Ashley
[4667.60 - 4672.32] then continued on with her pattern of
[4669.88 - 4674.36] Simply pivoting when proven wrong she
[4672.32 - 4676.32] started spreading new versions of false
[4674.36 - 4678.80] stories about about Stephanie and other
[4676.32 - 4681.16] plotters followed suit they combined
[4678.80 - 4683.28] their pivoted new and updated false
[4681.16 - 4685.00] narratives about Stephanie with other
[4683.28 - 4687.88] types of false information about medical
[4685.00 - 4689.72] medium and the community absolutely
[4687.88 - 4691.84] anything they could piece together and
[4689.72 - 4694.28] fabricate to try to disparage medical
[4691.84 - 4696.44] medium Robbie and Christina were both
[4694.28 - 4698.60] reportedly caught deleting comments and
[4696.44 - 4700.20] blocking anyone who recognized their
[4698.60 - 4702.20] voices and asked them about their
[4700.20 - 4705.28] involvement with this plot to take
[4702.20 - 4707.60] Anthony and the community down numerous
[4705.28 - 4709.48] other individuals have been caught lying
[4707.60 - 4712.40] about their involvement which is going
[4709.48 - 4714.92] to be exposed Ashley even tried to
[4712.40 - 4717.32] Gaslight people by claiming that things
[4714.92 - 4720.04] everyone heard the plotter say very
[4717.32 - 4723.68] clearly that can't mean anything else in
[4720.04 - 4725.36] any other context were not said and then
[4723.68 - 4728.08] a couple months after the attempt to
[4725.36 - 4731.24] hack into my computer was unsuccessful
[4728.08 - 4732.40] another suspicious event occurred some
[4731.24 - 4734.44] of you may have noticed that our
[4732.40 - 4737.68] previous four podcast episodes came down
[4734.44 - 4739.68] from Apple in the fall of last year
[4737.68 - 4741.68] Ashley Foster instantly started
[4739.68 - 4744.72] spreading rumors that they were taken
[4741.68 - 4747.00] down because they contained illegal
[4744.72 - 4749.60] recordings this became her favorite
[4747.00 - 4753.00] deflection tactic and false
[4749.60 - 4755.48] claim once Ashley posted a screenshot of
[4753.00 - 4758.16] a message she had gotten that says the
[4755.48 - 4760.48] plot thickens the plotter podcasts from
[4758.16 - 4762.84] this year are gone not sure if you knew
[4760.48 - 4765.24] that and Ashley
[4762.84 - 4767.24] replied I did yes
[4765.24 - 4770.32] they were removed by Apple because they
[4767.24 - 4770.32] contained illegal
[4770.40 - 4775.36] recordings this is not true and I'm
[4773.80 - 4777.88] happy to report that the podcast
[4775.36 - 4780.20] episodes became available again on Apple
[4777.88 - 4783.48] in January of this year ironically
[4780.20 - 4785.40] shortly after Ashley posted this falsity
[4783.48 - 4788.28] it's important for everyone to know what
[4785.40 - 4790.96] really happened a law firm whose client
[4788.28 - 4793.36] was kept Anonymous filed a strange vague
[4790.96 - 4796.32] claim with apple demanding the podcast
[4793.36 - 4798.64] be taken down Apple sent my team an
[4796.32 - 4800.84] email just to alert us of the claim and
[4798.64 - 4803.52] to give us the ability to dispute it
[4800.84 - 4806.80] unfortunately this email somehow went to
[4803.52 - 4809.08] spam so my team did not see it in time
[4806.80 - 4811.96] we found out later that Apple has a
[4809.08 - 4814.08] policy that they only give you 5 days to
[4811.96 - 4816.64] respond otherwise they just
[4814.08 - 4819.20] automatically remove the content by
[4816.64 - 4821.96] default because my team didn't see the
[4819.20 - 4825.24] email that is what happened they were
[4821.96 - 4828.08] removed by default after 5 days had
[4825.24 - 4830.32] passed but this whole time they've
[4828.08 - 4833.12] always remained up on every other
[4830.32 - 4835.44] platform because nothing was actually
[4833.12 - 4838.48] wrong with the episodes it was just a
[4835.44 - 4840.68] fluke that the email alert went to spam
[4838.48 - 4843.08] so we couldn't dispute it in time
[4840.68 - 4846.32] anybody can file a claim even if it's
[4843.08 - 4848.88] unfounded and inaccurate and if my team
[4846.32 - 4850.96] would have seen the email we would have
[4848.88 - 4852.12] been able to provide evidence to refute
[4850.96 - 4854.68] the claim
[4852.12 - 4857.04] immediately we were very upset when we
[4854.68 - 4859.76] realized that the podcast episodes were
[4857.04 - 4862.68] unjustly removed from Apple due to a m
[4859.76 - 4864.36] fluke Apple told us we needed to first
[4862.68 - 4866.68] try and deal with the law firm that
[4864.36 - 4869.44] requested the podcast to be taken down
[4866.68 - 4872.76] but that law firm refused to engage with
[4869.44 - 4874.40] us and ignored our Outreach we informed
[4872.76 - 4876.96] apple and then Apple ended up
[4874.40 - 4880.04] investigating the claim after this
[4876.96 - 4882.20] thorough investigation Apple concluded
[4880.04 - 4884.60] that there is absolutely nothing wrong
[4882.20 - 4887.36] with the podcast episodes and that the
[4884.60 - 4889.40] recordings are in fact legal the
[4887.36 - 4892.32] episodes were restored to Apple in
[4889.40 - 4894.28] January and they all still remain up on
[4892.32 - 4897.44] every other
[4894.28 - 4900.84] platform as I've said all along the
[4897.44 - 4902.84] recordings were legally obtained and
[4900.84 - 4905.28] that has now been confirmed by Apple
[4902.84 - 4908.36] itself in its restoration of our
[4905.28 - 4911.68] episodes once again Ashley Foster is
[4908.36 - 4915.16] wrong and her claims are false even
[4911.68 - 4916.92] Apple itself has now proved Ashley wrong
[4915.16 - 4920.28] Anthony posted about this ridiculous
[4916.92 - 4922.84] ordeal in January and one commenter said
[4920.28 - 4925.32] hm so who was the anonymous person this
[4922.84 - 4927.24] Law Firm acted on behalf of that's what
[4925.32 - 4929.28] I want to know but there are not many
[4927.24 - 4931.56] options are there kind of obvious who
[4929.28 - 4934.08] would go to such lengths to get it taken
[4931.56 - 4936.44] down it seems as though the claim that
[4934.08 - 4938.24] was filed with apple was another attempt
[4936.44 - 4940.56] to suppress our ability to defend the
[4938.24 - 4943.12] truth and disprove the attacks and the
[4940.56 - 4946.00] false narrative this organized hateful
[4943.12 - 4949.08] group is responsible for for but such
[4946.00 - 4951.36] attempts are not going to stand we are
[4949.08 - 4954.80] going to continue unraveling their
[4951.36 - 4958.08] contrived stories lies tactics
[4954.80 - 4960.20] disinformation and more the behavior
[4958.08 - 4962.04] this organized hateful group has
[4960.20 - 4964.28] exhibited which we've only just
[4962.04 - 4967.44] scratched the surface of in this episode
[4964.28 - 4969.32] is beyond scandalous I've never
[4967.44 - 4972.36] experienced such little regard for the
[4969.32 - 4975.48] truth in my life from any individual let
[4972.36 - 4977.28] alone a coordinated group of people or
[4975.48 - 4979.48] such little regard for how one's
[4977.28 - 4982.52] Behavior impacts other
[4979.48 - 4985.08] people unfortunately Ashley Foster and
[4982.52 - 4987.68] her hateful group have caused very real
[4985.08 - 4989.92] harm to many people's real lives in
[4987.68 - 4991.32] their pursuit of a documentary deal and
[4989.92 - 4994.32] all of the benefits that would come
[4991.32 - 4996.08] along with that for them at all costs
[4994.32 - 4997.72] and their willingness to just say
[4996.08 - 5000.84] anything to get a rise out of people
[4997.72 - 5003.12] using Anthony's name it matters greatly
[5000.84 - 5004.72] to bring attention to this it matters
[5003.12 - 5006.92] greatly for everyone to know what's
[5004.72 - 5008.92] really going on here there are many
[5006.92 - 5011.04] episodes to come and they're not going
[5008.92 - 5014.36] to be able to stop us from defending the
[5011.04 - 5017.12] truth some of you may be unaware that
[5014.36 - 5019.32] this has even been happening but many of
[5017.12 - 5021.68] you have been tremendously injured and
