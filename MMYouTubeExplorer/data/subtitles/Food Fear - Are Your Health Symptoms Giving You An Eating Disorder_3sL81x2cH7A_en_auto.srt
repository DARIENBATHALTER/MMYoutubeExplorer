I'm not against it you know it's not

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,480
that kind of thing this is an anti-

16
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,640
tattoo podcast episode but it's really

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,960
important because it's an important

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,960
podcast episode about tattoos and how to

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,800
keep your health safe so it is really

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,239
important so I talk about toxic heavy

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,480
metals yes toxic heavy metals in your

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,440
tattoo ink and how there is no such

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,159
thing and I repeat there is no such

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,479
thing as tattoo ink that's metal free I

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,080
repeat so I just hope that gets out

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,439
there and Rings throughout the ether and

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
then leaves this planet and then heads

28
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,000
through the solar system and then into

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,200
the Galaxy and then out out of the

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,360
Galaxy and into the universe and there

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
forth because it's important to know and

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,280
maybe people on another planet somewhere

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,000
that are doing all this ink and tattoos

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,200
and everything else maybe they'll hear

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,119
it and that will travel all the way to

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,520
that planet and get to them and someone

37
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,920
will be sitting there maybe by a lake

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,119
and they're going to hear it and it's

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,159
going to be like there's no such thing

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,000
as metal free ink there is no such thing

41
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
I want people to know this I don't care

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,520
if it's crueltyfree animal free the

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,759
whole bit listen to this podcast episode

44
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,320
it's not about being afraid of your

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,479
tattoo or going to get your tattoo

46
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,880
removed through the latest technology

47
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:00,479

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,600

itself don't remove your tattoos don't

50
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,399

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,120
can't live with the tattoo and you want

52
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,200

so much information really protective

88
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,439
information too including things to

89
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,400
avoid like certain supplementation and

90
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,239

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,959
you don't already have it go to the

95
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,120
library get get it out of the library if

96
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,040
you want okay so for instance if you

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,920
have a hot spot in your intestinal tract

98
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,519
so if you got a hot spot if you're

99
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,599
inflamed somewhere in your intestinal

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,200
tract if you're inflamed somewhere

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,519
anywhere in here and you eat something

102
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,480
and it finds its way going down here and

103
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,519
it's taking its time and it's going

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,919
through right and it finally gets down

105
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,959
to that hot spot and it hits it and now

106
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:24,520
you're nauseous or you got a pain you're

107
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,720
going to think whoa it was that food

108
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,360
food fear develops very easily because

109
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,960
of this this is just one example I'm

110
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,440
going to cut so much into this this

111
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,000
information you're going to love it you

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
are absolutely going to love this

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,039
information so if you had a hot spot

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,400
anywhere in your intestinal tra if you

115
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,199
got a hot spot in your dadum see you got

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,039
a lot of inflammation in your dadum

117
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,600
because you have hpylori or you have an

118
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:50,600
old infection that's been festering in

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,240
there for 10 years 15 years say you got

120
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,880
all this extra yeast and mold growing in

121
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,759
here you're inflamed because of a virus

122
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,720
or say like a shinkles virus creating

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,720
colitis or something else so you got

124
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,080
diagnosed with crohn's whatever it is

125
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,560
that's going on whatever's happening

126
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,280
here you got a hot spot inside your

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,000
intestinal tract and maybe it never went

128
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,039
that far and you've never been diagnosed

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,680
and you're just kind of like you're

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
dealing with certain aches and pains or

131
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,039
certain stomach cramps or flatulence or

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,720
stomach issues are bloating whatever it

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,600
is the food you eat you'll associate it

134
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,039
with those symptoms very quick and

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,479
easily regardless of what it is it could

136
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,800
be something really healthy it could be

137
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,280
something really good for you it could

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,759

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,160
and eating in food when you don't even

185
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,160
know why you're even having a symptom or

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,479
a condition or a problem and we easily

187
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,479
associate a food we have instantly to a

188
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,479
problem right so if I had some kind of

189
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,240
inflammation because I had some strep in

190
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,440
my intestinal tract or strep in my colon

191
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,080
and I had some ecoli in my colon and

192
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,560
it's creating all kinds of different

193
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,680
pivots and divots inside my colon and

194
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,520
intestinal tract just say I had that

195
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,360
right and then I eating something or

196
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,639
whatever it is and then I'm not feeling

197
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,199
good because that's starting to ache

198
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,639
down here or however it is I'm going to

199
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,639
be so messed up in my head I'm going to

200
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,680
be like I I don't know if it was that

201
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,720
maybe I should just have some toast some

202
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,280
dry toast or something and scrape off

203
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,840
the burnt stuff off the toast and just

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,919
have that plain I'm nauseous I got some

205
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,319
pain it confuses people everything does

206
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,080
no matter what it is that they have you

207
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,800
know going on and there's people who are

208
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,159
suffering from bloating constantly and

209
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
they want to get rid of that bloating so

210
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,599
they get told to drink celery juice

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,760
because they hear about it working and

212
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,240
saving lives and they go and they have

213
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,519
some and they're bloating still there

214
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
and they're like oh it's the celery

215
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,160
juice the celery juice is causing the

216
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,760
problem now it's every day it's a new

217
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,360
thing causing a problem and we get the

218
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
food fear so the food fear just goes

219
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,240
crazy in our minds and rightfully so

220
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,920
because it's that confusing and that

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,320
difficult to navigate and so people

222
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,720
don't realize the minute you start

223
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,160
getting sick the minute you start

224
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,600

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,040

situation of

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:37,480
PTSD so every time you put food in your

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,560
mouth this can develop into an eating

318
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,279
disorder where you're actually getting a

326
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,600
that actually are are there to help you

327
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:07,920
heal and recover

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,639
foods that are not helping you and you

330
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:14,639
keep them in because they feel good in

331
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,240
the moment it seems so that's where the

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,199
confusion lies as well we sit there we

333
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,399

eat a food that seems to settle okay

335
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,000

336
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,240
food's feeding a problem a condition

eat a carrot I was told carrots are

379
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,519
healthy and now they're all of a sudden

380
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,920

they're eating cheese and they're like

383
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,920
that's that's the only thing I can eat

384
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,279
is a piece of cheese or an egg or a

385
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,040
piece of toast and they end up in that

386
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,079
situation where they're pretty much on

387
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,519
toast egg and cheese diet I don't know

388
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,880

like milk toast eggs and cheese that's

390
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,839
what they end up in or rice pudding

391
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,319

and this is a really critical critical

400
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,240
topic because it's happening every day

401
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,000
to people new people every day people

402
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,920
there in IG I'm so sorry you guys

405
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,720
struggled with this along the way I'm

406
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,560
hitting the intestinal track talk first

407
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,880
with this issue but we're going to go

408
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,040
deeper into other places of how it works

409
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,360
with your brain how it works with

410
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,079
emotions how it works with creating the

411
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,519
eating disorder the food fear because

412
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,880
that's what we're talking about here is

413
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
food fear and it's food fear developed

414
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,160
from not feeling good and getting a

415
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,199
symptom not knowing what to eat still

416
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
struggling with that symptom associating

417
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,199
that food with that that symptom and

418
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,040
then we're now down a rabbit hole that's

419
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,680
what we're talking about today so let's

420
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,759
go into it first I want to take a little

421
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,160
sip here I want to finish some of my

422
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,759
orange you here if that's okay with you

423
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,959
guys tra said this oh wait um TR said

424
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,920
this is exactly my mother explanation

425
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,680
points this is wild you're touching on

426
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,720
exactly everything she's going through

427
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,279
it's like you heard our prayers listen

428
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,880
and I want to talk about to something

429
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,720
very important okay that that you can

430
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,480
heal and you can get better and you can

431
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,919
recover and get past this there's a way

432
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,319
also to understanding how this works

433
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,799
with Foods where you're feeling this way

434
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,520
and you're afraid and you're having that

435
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
food fear but there's a way to come out

436
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,880
of it and just having this knowledge

437
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,760
alone is going to help people out there

438
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,360
because once you understand this a

439
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,199
little bit you understand your body then

440
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,079
you understand what's going on and you

441
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,000
could rise above the food fear and the

442
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,280
eating disorders that are created and

443
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,520
the PTSD that's created from it it's all

444
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,280
important Catalina over there in IG this

445
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,240
is exactly how I felt for 3 years whoa

446
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,440
three years whoa where I'm scared to eat

447
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,720
because everything makes me bloated and

448
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,039
then it's scary and here's what happens

449
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,679
on that one since we are in the

450
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,679

452
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,200

492
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,640
this let's go into the bloating thing a

493
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,159
little bit the bloating thing is a

494
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,520
tricky one because you can be bloated

495
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,640
from something you ate 2 days ago and

496
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,280
then it still has you bloated and then

497
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,200
you eat something that can get rid of

498
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,600
your bloat so you drink or eat something

499
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,720
that can get rid of your bloat and but

500
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,799
you're now bloated you're bloed from

501
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:14,840
something else before days ago even a

502
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,159
week ago and now you're trying to eat

503
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,120
something or take something or drink

504
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:23,520
something that can fix your bloating if

505
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:27,200
you knew to do it long term if you knew

506
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,240
to do it long enough it could fix it but

507
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,520
you'll never know because

508
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,320
you'll never know you're still bloated

509
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,120
you don't know to do something long-term

510
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,559
enough you won't know what to avoid a

511
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,760
lot of people won't know what to avoid

512
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,360
and we run into a

513
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:44,880
problem Michelle haters attacking the

514
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,039

all right let's

537
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,279
move so basically the bottom line is

538
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,559
what I see in a lot of people and plus

539
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,120
with the bloating and it wasn't going to

540
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,799
be a bloating talk but it's good to talk

541
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:53,559
about it a little bit what happens is

542
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,799
that the HCL is so diminished your

543
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,919
gastric lands are so

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,799
growing in

547
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,799
here your liver stagnant and

548
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,840

551
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,679
have to get the bloating down like

552
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,760
celery juice is critical for recovering

553
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:23,919
bloat because it's restoring your htl

killing off pathogens yeast mold

556
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,520
overgrowth of unproductive fun

557
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,279
fungus that's important all on its own

558
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,240
it's a medical medium tool you guys know

559
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,559
that tool and there's a lot of other

560
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,200
medical medium tools to get rid of

561
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,880
bloating but the point is is that in

562
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,400
order though to get rid of

563
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,720
bloating one has to understand that they

564
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,440
may be eating foods that aren't creating

565
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,480
their bloating but they're going to help

566
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,600
you get to the finish line but what

567
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,039
happens with bloating is you may eat a

568
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,880
healthy food that's going to help you

569
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:05,480
get to the finish line but instead you

570
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,000
get bloated because you're so hypers

571
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,080
sensitive that you're going to bloat so

572
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,760
easy you become afraid of that food you

573
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,200
become afraid of 4 ounces of celery

574
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,440
juice you become afraid of

575
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,720
papaya afraid of a steamed

576
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,919
potato you become afraid of a wild

577
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,080
blueberry you become afraid of something

578
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,159
and then you're in this place where

579
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,360
you're afraid now of spinach you're

580
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,440
afraid of a leafy graen and when you get

581
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,200
to that point of fear and you don't know

582
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,480
what to eat we end up going to comfort

583
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,240
Foods foods that we've been eating since

584
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,080
we were a child foods that we've been

585
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,559
eating since we were young and we end up

586
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,600
running to like eggs cheese and toast

587
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,880
again we end up running back to Pasta

588
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,200
macaroni and cheese eggs toast we end up

589
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,200
running back to bread we end up running

590
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,000
back to these kinds of foods or we end

591
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,760
up running back to treats and chocolate

592
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
and things like that because we don't

593
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,600
know where to go we get stressed we're

594
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,200
totally frustrated with our healing

595
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,720
process and what's wrong and we just we

596
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,480
go running for things that aren't going

597
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:18,760
to help us and it happens every day out

598
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,919
there mono eating is a miracle okay a

599
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,760
miracle for people so I'm going to grab

600
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,640
the cleanse the heel book right

601
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,000
here all right so medical medium put

602
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,320
mono eating um on the map all these

603
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,919
years and it's important to understand

604
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:39,039
how it works right when you do like a

605
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,520
mono eating where it's like bananas and

606
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,279
celery juice or steamed potatoes and

607
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,559
celery juice and if you look you'll see

608
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,679
the different varieties in here what

609
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,440
happens is that you end up building up

610
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,240
your

611
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,600
HCL you end up healing the environment

612
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,640
in your intestinal tract you end up

613
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,600
reducing pathogen loads and you you end

614
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,880
up recovering so so many people go to

615
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,720
the mono eating and cleanse the heel

616
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,399
because it literally saves their life it

617
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,720

618
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,080

619
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,039
out out there in the world in medical M

620
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,919
community that were able to avoid a

621
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:21,000
surgery where their doctor their surgeon

622
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,640

626
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,000
their themselves from radical surgical

627
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,039

649
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,480
them P back back out of this and I'm

650
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
talking about the monoc cleans cuz so

651
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
many people have food fear and if they

652
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,799
have a symptom or condition anything

653
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,880
intestinal tract anything stomach

654
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,080
anything like that that they're

655
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:47,320
suffering and struggling with it's now a

656
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:50,039
game of PTSD what do I eat food

657
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,880
fear and we end up with this eating

658
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,440
disorder around all of it and we're

659
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,799
suffering and we're struggling and we

660
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,679
don't know how to get out of it but when

661
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
you have direction and you know what to

662
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,320
do and you end up doing something like

663
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,240
the medical medium monoc cleanse and you

664
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,159
choose one that's right for you just

665
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,480
choose the one that you feel will work

666
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,080
because that's the whole thing you can

667
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,559
choose different ones in here you could

668
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,559
try one try another and then what

669
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,840
happens is as you're recovering at least

670
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:18,559
you have a a schematic at least you have

671
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:20,919
a catalyst to actually adhere by to take

672
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,760
you to that finish line where you don't

673
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,039
have to be always questioning things

674
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,200
like is this not good is this not good

675
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:29,799
because you don't have to question some

676
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,960
something that's literally saved that

677
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:33,640
many lives and healed that many people

678
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,640

digesting the lettuce is

709
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,080
digesting they don't think it's

710
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,760
digesting but it is but what they're

711
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,679

727
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,679

728
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,320
again what they don't

729
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,399
realize is it's okay to eat the lettuce

730
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,039
it's okay to eat the Cucumber it's okay

731
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,000
to eat the tomato but then they're in

732
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,600
fear that it's not okay because they're

733
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,399
feeling something but what they don't

734
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,519
realize is they're feeling a hot

735
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:12,640
spot they're feeling a Hot Spot

736
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,640
somewhere whether it's a hot spot where

737
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
it's just

738
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,799
bloat or it's a hot spot where they're

739
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,200
feeling a cramp or some pressure or a

740
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,880
little bit of pain or discomfort or

741
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
something else and they're feeling like

742
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,080
they're not digesting that wrong lettuce

743
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,600
they feel like they're not digesting

744
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,200
there's tomatoes and

745
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,320
cucumbers and that orange they ate or

746
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,840
whatever it is and they're just like I

747
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,880
cannot eat citrus I cannot ever have

748
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,120
citrus I can never have a cucumber I

749
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,200
can't have a tomato rolled out rolled

750
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,679
out they rolled out went out no Citrus

751
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,360
no cucumber no tomato No cilantro no

752
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,440
spinach no lettuce no kale no MH no this

753
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,639
no that they've rolled it all out gone

754
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,360
gone gone they you can't have a raw

755
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:03,000
piece of broccoli ever you can't have a

756
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,720
raw piece of cauliflower anymore all

757
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,039
those are ruled out and gone so we have

758
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,320
this problem

759
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,240
where they can't eat anything raw

760
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,880
completely rolled out so now they're in

761
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,279
that zone nothing raw so what that means

762
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,399
is they won't even have any raw juice

763
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,600
they won't have raw celery they won't

764
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,240
have raw celery juice which is different

765
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,760
and it works differently you guys know

766
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,919
the whole rules with celery juice

767
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,279
16 ounces on an empty

768
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,279
stomach

769
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,720
strained right strained so it can get in

770
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,000
there do its thing flush clean the liver

771
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,240
rebuild the hydrochloric acid get things

772
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,039
back to back to square

773
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,519
one but the point is all that roughage

774
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,240
they'll never be able to eat a carrot

775
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:53,399
rolled out carrots

776
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:59,000
gone raw cabbage in a salad raw cabbage

777
00:31:53,399 --> 00:32:02,840
is gone everything by heirloom tomato

778
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,760
gone so you walk down red bell peppers

779
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,360
gone so it just suddenly it's food fear

780
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,600
I can't eat

781
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:16,039
anything all of these foods are

782
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,760
gone Apple peaches nectarines Cherries

783
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,200

gone melons

785
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,039
gone it just disappears it's out of your

786
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,639
diet now so now you're like I can only

787
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:33,519
do cook food or

788
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:34,559
toast or eggs and I hear eggs are so

789
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,960
healthy and blah blah blah and

790
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,080
everybody's talking about eggs so let me

791
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,600
go on a whole bunch of eggs four or six

792
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,039
eggs a day because it's the only thing I

793
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,960
can eat because it doesn't seem to hurt

794
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:47,919
when I eat an egg so what they don't

795
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,000
realize is they end up losing all these

796
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,080
foods that can help them

797
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,600
heal but then because they don't

798
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
understand and how know how to read

799
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,039
their hot

800
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
spots and they think they're not

801
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,760
digesting it

802
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,320
whatsoever and they have food fear to

803
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,159
towards all these foods and then they

804
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:12,240
eat an egg and they don't feel anything

805
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:16,279
no hot spot no problem no discomfort

806
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,440
they eat a nice fluffy scrambled egg

807
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,519
they need a n they eat a nice batch of

808
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,120
fluffy egg

809
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,760
whites and it goes down in here they get

810
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,639
a hardboiled egg and it goes down and it

811
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,279
sits in here and what's happening what

812
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,399
they don't realize is the egg is

813
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:37,240
liquefying it's turning into a goo and

814
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:39,880
that goo isn't massaging the intestinal

815
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,159
tract it's not massaging the colon It's

816
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,000
not massaging the stomach and what's

817
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,840
happening is that egg is just turning

818
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,320
into a little like a ball of glue forget

819
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,559
eggs that bread is turning into a ball

820
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,760
of glue forget bread that cheese is

821
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,039
turning into a ball of glue and it

822
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,279
sitting in there and it feels okay it

823
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,200
feels

824
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,559
good hey that bread pasta

825
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,919
basically that wheat

826
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,040
pasta with the cheese sitting in there

827
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,520
like goo and it's not touching anything

828
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,440
so it's not touching any of the hot

829
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:19,839
spots you're not getting red flags no

830
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,919
red flag here no red flag there no red

831
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,639
flag there but what's happening is the

832
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,000
eggs the dairy products the cheese the

833
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,639
milk the butter all of that that's

834
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,960

835
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,960
feeding what's keeping you

836
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,159
sick it's feeding what's keeping you

837
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,280
sick and then you end up with the same

838
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,399
symptoms no matter what that come and go

839
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,399
so now it's not like every symptoms gone

840
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,399
cuz you're eating milk eggs cheese and

841
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,280
butter and bread and it's becoming a goo

842
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,280
and it's not touching anything inside

843
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,680
and it's becoming a goo it's not any hot

844
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,680
spots for the moment but you stay sick

845
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,880
you end up getting sicker and then all

846
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,000
of a sudden because everything you're

847
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,359
eating is feeding the bad bugs the

848
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,560
bacteria the unproductive yeast the

849
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,320
unproductive fungus and mold the viruses

850
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,599
because what you're eating is feeding

851
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,960
all of that you all of a sudden get a

852
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,520

spill a spill

854
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,480
over what that means is

855
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,480
it just all blows up the bacteria

856
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,119
proliferated the viruses got a little

857
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,760

smell this is where someone is living

their life and they're eating just as

954
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,160
anybody else would be eating and then

955
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,760
these symptoms start to develop you're

956
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,599
eating what everybody else is eating

957
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,680
you're living your life you're getting a

958
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,480
symptom and now the food becomes

959
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,319
questionable

960
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,720
this is so so

961
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:06,119
powerful hey Melanie over there on

962
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,480
YouTube thank you for timestamping so

963
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,240
many of those things you do on YouTube

964
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,760
when you do the the comment and you time

965
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,960
stamp it like you do that's actually

966
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,119
really cool by the

967
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,839
way in some cases if it's a chronic

968
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,400
nausea for example then Foods become

969
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,680
pick and choose a game of what's going

970
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:28,839
to help ease this nausea the nausea hell

971
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:33,119
the nausea hell have you been through it

972
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:37,359
before it torments pregnant

973
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,280
women who don't know what to eat they

974
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,720
have a baby

975
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,040
developing the baby developing needs

976
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,040
nutrients the best

977
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,599
nutrients the

978
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,599
nausea is like

979
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,240
this

980
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:57,440
barrier to getting nutrients to the baby

981
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,359
because when women become pregnant and

982
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,280
they're nauseous all the time they end

983
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:04,800
up choosing foods that are trying to

984
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,520
work with the nausea versus choosing a

985
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,280
food that's going to be really good for

986
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,520
that early stage of development for the

987
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,440
baby instead they're choosing things

988
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,200
like anything to break the nausea

989
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,319
they're choosing chocolate loaded with

990
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,920
caffeine that's really bad

991
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:21,960
for the tiny cells that are developing

992
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,560
into a a

993
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,359
fetus and so what's happening so they're

994
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,839
choosing things that are they're trying

995
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:32,040
to calm the nausey down the morning

996
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:36,480
sickness so they're just eating gluten

997
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:39,520
Rich toast with butter they're drinking

998
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,040
coffee yes they're eating chocolate

999
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,200

1000
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,240
they're eating chocolate cake they're

1001
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,800
just working with the nausea no judgment

1002
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,720
nothing like that I'm giving you an

1003
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,359
example of how those early cells of the

1004
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,160
baby need celery

1005
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,520
juice they need sweet

1006
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,480
potatoes they need winter squash kaboa

1007
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,680
squash they need beautiful red

1008
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,560
potatoes they need

blueberries they need raspberries they

1010
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,920
need all of these things these early

1011
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:18,880
cells of the baby that are just

1012
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,240
developing need all of these foods but

1013
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,800
instead because of the

1014
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,079
nausea those foods are on the list for a

1015
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,240
lot of women that get that early nausea

1016
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:29,160
with early pregnancy and they're just

1017
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,040
looking for just glue they're looking

1018
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,599
for just glue to just kind of calm the

1019
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,599
nausea

1020
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,920
down okay in some cases if someone has

1021
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,960
chronic nausea and chronic nausea just

1022
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,680
minus the pregnancy like nausea in

1023

during pregnancy I was so scared to eat

1064
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,640
anything with

1065
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:43,760
seasoning

1066
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,960

1070
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,720
for so many people I'm so sorry you've

1071
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,720
gone through

1072
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,480
that do do any of the foods I'm eating

1073
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
are they the reason for my nausea are

1074
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,520
they creating the nausea then our mind

1075
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,640
and our Consciousness starts to pick up

1076
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,160
on patterns and habits because of small

1077
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,160
bursts of PTSD developing did you hear

1078
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,240
that you guys you guys got to have this

1079
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,200
book tell other people about this book

1080
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,559
such a great

1081
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,359
book you eat something and you're

1082
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,960
nauseous so you

1083
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:30,440
identify that food as being the problem

1084
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,559
so you learn to avoid that food just as

1085
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,359
you get comfortable eating another food

1086
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,920
thinking you're safe and good you get

1087
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:39,559
nauseous again you just got comfortable

1088
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,079
with that food you're starting to eat an

1089
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:42,680
orange you're comfortable with that food

1090
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,119

Orange Boom see you later orange Gone

1094
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,319
With the Wind

1095
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,680
man you just started getting comfortable

1096
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,839
with each food and then you're

1097
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,960
uncomfortable with that food so Kiss It

1098
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,040
Goodbye you think you're safe and you

1099
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:08,160
think you're good and then boom you're

then that's another food you're

1102
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,800
uncomfortable eating suspecting it's

1103
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:16,760
contributing to the problem is that my

1104
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,160
problem is it my problem this can carry

1105
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:21,440
on into other Foods as well nausea

1106
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,599
doesn't usually receive a diagnosis

1107
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,640
because nausea or maybe nervous could

1108
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,359
maybe be nervousness and anxiety

1109
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,599
if everything checks out okay in the

1110
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,599
abdomen it's passed off as you're just

1111
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,680
sensitive so nausea really is the

1112
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,440
diagnosis it doesn't really get a

1113
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,119
diagnosis especially if everything

1114
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,240
checks out okay if you're somebody with

1115
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,520
a mystery

1116
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,920

1117
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,440

younger if you're younger and you're not

1272
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:43,079
older and you're a young

1273
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,599
person then there's really eyeballs on

1274
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:48,559
what you're doing and if you got a lot

1275
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,079
of aunts and uncles and cousins and

1276
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,160
family members and they all start

1277
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,200
thinking you're the one with the

1278
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,640
tightness of the chest you're the one

1279
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,599
with the anxiety you're the one that

1280
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,079
doesn't want to eat this doesn't want to

1281
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:03,119
eat that not sure what to eat here it's

1282
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,520
always about a food problem and you're

1283
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,200
one of those

1284
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,640
people now you're going to be like up sh

1285
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,799
you know up shit's creek without a

1286
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,559
paddle

1287
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:18,559
right your original symptoms don't even

1288
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:20,040
matter anymore it's like no I started

1289
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,520
out with the pain in my chest the

1290
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,280
tightness of my chest I started out and

1291
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,880
they said it was panic attacks but then

1292
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,480
I got tingles and numbness in my arms

1293
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,040
and then I got this and then I got this

1294
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,079
I got fatigue that doesn't matter

1295
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,520
anymore it's all about what you're

1296
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:33,920
eating

1297
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,799
now affirmation 65 over there in IG that

1298
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:41,240
was my life

1299
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:45,000
OMG you got an audience now you sought

1300
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:47,400
out doctors to get help but that's long

1301
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,040
been forgotten by the

1302
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,079
audience especially if you're like 21 or

1303
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:57,520
25 years old or 28 years old

1304
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:59,440
or 18 years old or younger or

1305
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,119
however maybe in your 30s but either way

1306
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,760
you have an audience now and now you got

1307
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:07,880
like friends friends

1308
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,240
friends family family friends family

1309
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,240
friends co-workers families friends and

1310
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,280
they're all watching you and it isn't

1311
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,920
about your symptoms anymore it's just

1312
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:19,480
about you and your food and how you

1313
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,960
screwed up it's you and your food and

1314
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,799
how you have a must have an eating

1315
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,160
disorder now and maybe your symptoms

1316
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,760
weren't really real to begin with maybe

1317
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,359
you're that just the problems weren't

1318
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,440
really real maybe you're not really sick

1319
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,039
you were sick you got doctors saying you

1320
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,880
were sick I guess but all that's kind of

1321
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,960
drifting away cuz it's all about what

1322
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,559
you're putting in your mouth in your

1323
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,039
foods and your problems and your foods

1324
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:45,079
and that's compiling and compounding the

1325
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:47,200
PTSD causing now even more riffs more

1326
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:49,039
PTSD and now you feel like you're really

1327
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,359
down the rabbit hole and no one

1328
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,839
understands you and you're

1329
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,200
misunderstood mean J over there on

1330
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,599
YouTube thank you for being here by the

1331
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,559
way you're speaking to me right now you

1332
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:04,520
you said you commented amazing ter appan

1333
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:07,119
can relate to everything you're

1334
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:09,440
describing over there in IG family and

1335
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,319
friends could never understand it wasn't

1336
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,960
until I had to have emergency surgery

1337
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:19,280
that they believed

1338
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:22,799
me the focus is all gone now it's the

1339
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,520
focus on you're not eating enough are

1340
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:29,880
you eating enough you're eating too much

1341
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:32,960
you're getting too skinny you're looking

1342
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:37,359
sickly you need to put some meat on your

1343
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,400
bones are you getting enough

1344
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:44,079
protein and you're not eating the right

1345
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:45,039
things then the fear of eating occurs

1346
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,400
and

1347
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,520
intensifies and that's harder than

1348
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,559
anyone can understand and it happens

1349
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,799
every day out there there are people

1350
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,240
just you know there are people that

1351
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:57,599
Heckle the medical medium community and

1352
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,039
and they're just trying to put fear and

1353
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,200
doubt in their minds are you getting

1354
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,720
enough protein are you getting enough

1355
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,799
protein there's so there's it's

1356
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,920
everywhere it's everywhere and when

1357
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:11,839
you're sick and struggling and you don't

1358
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:15,640
feel good it's like the vultures come in

1359
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:18,160
is what they do the vultures come in and

1360
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,799
they just say the rotten this crap and

1361
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,880
they don't understand what you've been

1362
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:24,520
through they don't know what your

1363
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,559
struggles are they're not in your shoes

1364
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:30,160
and at your home

1365
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:30,160
they don't get

1366
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,640
it even if you

1367
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,960
diagnose Even If you're diagnosed with a

1368
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,440
named physical condition right off the

1369
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,480
bat it's easy to develop an eating

1370
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,240
disorder in part because there's still

1371
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,760
not a medical understanding of what

1372
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,880
causes the

1373
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:53,119
condition so it's not getting healed

1374
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,200
somebody with a simple case of heartburn

1375
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,920
acid reflux or exam for example can

1376
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,119
develop an eating order because it's

1377
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,880
always on their mind let's hit that a

1378
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,280
little

1379
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:06,359
bit W blueberries over

1380
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:09,000
there the protein brainwashing has drove

1381
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:12,119
me crazy and we will have to deal with

1382
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,039
it for the rest of

1383
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:18,599
Life yeah this just that's powerful by

1384
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,920
the

1385
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:23,559
way okay so I want to go into this part

1386
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,359
this is interesting right here right

1387
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:27,960
even if it's something like a simple

1388
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:29,760
case of of heartburn acid reflux you

1389
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,520
guys for example it can develop into an

1390
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:35,119
eating disorder because it's always on

1391
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,520
your mind because it's here it's like

1392
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,000
heartburn what do I eat oh that bothers

1393
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,960
me oh that doesn't bother me that

1394
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,240
doesn't bother me that bothers

1395
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,799
me a friend I haven't talked to in a

1396
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,880
long long time reached out to me and

1397
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,760
said you know I got this heartburn acid

1398
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:53,480
reflux thing I did all the testing at

1399
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:56,240
the doctor I did all this everything and

1400
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:59,640
um it's like I'm scared to eat anything

1401
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,599
W scared to eat anything anything I eat

1402
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,839
I don't know this was working for me

1403
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,480
yesterday it's not working for me today

1404
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:09,359
this might work for me tomorrow but it

1405
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:12,960
didn't when tomorrow came yesterday and

1406
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,960
your mind goes wof

1407
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,200
wof eating a food that seems to be

1408
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,280
working gives you a sense of security

1409
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,200
then if it isn't working anymore and the

1410
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:25,240
acid reflux or nausea returns it's like

1411
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,559
an old friend letting you down old

1412
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,680
friend letting you down sometimes it's

1413
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:31,839
not about the symptoms sometimes

1414
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,480
experiences when you're eating that food

1415
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,599
it's about what they're told about that

1416
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:41,480
food so here's a real brain screw

1417
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:43,640
is even if you discover somewhere along

1418
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,079
the way the right food to eat to heal

1419
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,520
yourself some [ __ ] is going to like

1420
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,000
tell you that it's the wrong food and

1421
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,640
it's bad for

1422
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,920
you I don't know how anybody can heal

1423
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:59,640
anymore out there I just don't know it's

1424
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,680
that bad there's that many sick people

1425
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,319
and they're just biohacking themselves

1426
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:08,000
to death and everybody's like squealing

1427
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:11,000
like pigs like do this do that buy my

1428
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,880
program do this eat this do

1429
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
that and darkness is rampant out there

1430
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,760
right now I don't know how people are

1431
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,119
going to survive in 10 years from now as

1432
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:22,480
it gets worse and worse and

1433
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:24,119
worse yeah they'll poach things for

1434
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,440
medical medium information that's healed

1435
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:28,720
people along the way but but they'll mix

1436
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,160
it with crap that won't heal them I

1437
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,880
don't know how anybody's going to get

1438
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,520
better down down the road Natalie says

1439
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:37,480
the sickest and most narcissistic people

1440
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,680
prey on those trying to better

1441
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:43,559
themselves we live in a sick world it's

1442
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:47,520
overwhelming sometimes well

1443
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:50,520
spoken I could not have said that better

1444
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:53,160
myself Dr Fawn biohackers are hacking

1445
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:57,200
People's Health away indeed they're

1446
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,920
pecking People's Health away

1447
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,920
food has an ingrain connection to our

1448
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,960
physical being our physical

1449
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,000
understanding even if we aren't dealing

1450
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,440
with ongoing Health complaints if

1451
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,720
someone is home one evening gets some

1452
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,599
kind of chest pain for a minute and gets

1453
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,760
on the phone with family and friends the

1454
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:16,039
first thing everyone says is what did

1455
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,480
you eat

1456
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:22,200
tonight if that person decides to go to

1457
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:25,000
the ER the doctor asks what did you eat

1458
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:26,599
tonight the question always comes up

1459
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,280
that's how interconnect ConEd we are

1460
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,440
with food in general and that's how we

1461
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,920
end up living with food fear like we are

1462
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,039
so

1463
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,119
interconnected it's one of those details

1464
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:38,039
that Patients First Volunteer every time

1465
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,240
they go into the ER to the hospital I

1466
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:42,559
ate this this tonight I ate this tonight

1467
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,200
I ate this ter appan says when people

1468
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:49,440
try to frame medical medium yeah frame

1469
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,000
that is the word yes as restrictive and

1470
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,480
fear-mongering the only reason I can eat

1471
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,640
without excruciating pain and fear is

1472
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,359
because of medical medium information

1473
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:02,640
I was literally starving to death I

1474
01:01:58,359 --> 01:02:02,640
couldn't eat thank you Tara you're the

1475
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,440
best I was sitting at home eating my

1476
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,240
dinner I had this terrible pain in my

1477
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,119
stomach my back my chest my lower

1478
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,359
abdomen I thought I don't know what I

1479
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,599
thought it come to the ER and that's the

1480
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:20,160
first thing people devou because the

1481
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:22,640
reason why they devou that information

1482
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,839
is because it's so intertwined to foods

1483
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:29,559
and eating and our health and foods and

1484
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:31,440
eating you guys I could go on all day

1485
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:33,720
long with this

1486
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,400
book that's how much incredible

1487
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:38,720
information is in this book Brain saver

1488
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,720
Casey shelman over there on YouTube I

1489
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,880
think sometimes it's jealousy and

1490
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:47,359
insecurity about how they eat

1491
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,400
sometimes projecting their fears on

1492
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:52,200
what's different but they see the

1493
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,200
healing but they project their fears

1494
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,359
because they don't want to have to think

1495
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,400
about healing and heal

1496
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:59,920
and what to eat and meaning like they

1497
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,279
think okay

1498
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,039
okay everybody thinks about what to eat

1499
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:08,079
I don't care who they are

1500
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:10,440
everyone and everyone is worried about

1501
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,160
their food to some degree no matter what

1502
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,880
because you can't just eat 10 loaves of

1503
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,440
bread with butter on it you'll end up

1504
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:18,559
with pancreatitis with with a pound of

1505
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,240
butter you can't just eat a whole

1506
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,799
chocolate cake every single night

1507
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,599
because that's not going to help you

1508
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:28,359
can't do a lot of things you got to be

1509
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:31,319
careful with Lis free celery 333 over

1510
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:33,880
there on YouTube I just read an anti-ed

1511
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:36,760
medium post from someone who was on

1512
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:39,720
medical medium for 7 years and gained 30

1513
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:42,000
lbs yet she is posting other supplements

1514
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,599
and chocolate and saying to be your own

1515
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,160
health expert and stop with the cult

1516
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:48,960
first of all you can't even tell you

1517
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,000
can't even trust if that's a real story

1518
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,359
meaning like the story they're trying to

1519
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,799
frame and paint there's been an attack

1520
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,480
on the medical medum community by a

1521
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:59,039
group of people you guys know about the

of people injured in the community we

1525

01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,240
us about their harm stories how damaged

1527
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:10,640
they are and injured they are and we're

1528
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,960
actually working on that working with

01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:16,200
them and doing something about that by

1530
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:19,440
the way and and it's going to be some

1531
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,920
people in trouble point is is that a lot

1532
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,920

you know I use like a handy wipe and it

1592
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:12,680
just cleans the cover right off and the

1593
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:15,079
conveyor belt at Amazon and then you

1594
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:17,720

1595
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:20,039

that for a while on Telegram and I

1644
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,839
talked all about how healing it is why

1645
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:29,279
it's healing how demons were kept out of

1646
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,679
that you know cuz the industry you know

1647
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,359
how the movie industry and the TV

1648
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:35,640
industry is can be really dark right

1649
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:38,080
like really dark with a lot of

1650
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,839
possession all of that stuff did I talk

1651
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:43,359
about that before like people just bring

1652
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:47,080
their demons into that stuff right and

1653
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,000
um and how the film industry can be

1654
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:52,000
really dark really

1655
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
dark

1656
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,320
and the film industry can be really

1657
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,320
really dark

1658
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:03,719
and Pride and Prejudice okay the not not

1659
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:07,920
Pride and Prejudice in general just the

1660
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:10,440
filming of the 1994 1995 Pride and

1661
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,600
Prejudice I talked about on telegram how

1662
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,040
healing it is for the nervous system

1663
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,880
there's a reason why it's healing for

1664
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,199
the nervous system so if you need

1665
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,000
something to watch because you're

1666
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,000
sensitive you need something that

1667
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,440
actually has a frequency that can help

1668
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,560

01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,480
Prejudice I have owned the series 1994

1681
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,480
51 since it came out on DVD so you know

1682
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,600
what I'm talking about there's a

1683
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,840
frequency right well no one knew that

1684
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,199
that there's this what happened was

1685
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,880
because I know because Spirit of

1686
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:12,400

1687
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,600
that those demonic forces Darkness

1688
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,320
everything was just kept out of that

1689
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,520
film because in the film industry it's a

1690
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:23,480
lot of Darkness everything was kept out

1691
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,920
of it and it's very powerful and heals

1692
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,960
the nerves it's incredible really

1693
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,679

1713
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,840

1722
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:39,360
Angels protected the filming process of
