17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,520
little bit counts that means if you're

going to eat a nut butter you want to

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
make sure you're not totally being

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,239
screwed over or taken advantage of or

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,000
ripped off or your body

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,579
being betrayed The Nut Butter companies

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,620
are betraying people bottom line see

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,480
that peanut butter that oil is not from

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,420
those peanuts see that almond butter

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,219
that oil is not from those almonds you

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,920
can't see this is it isn't clear but

28
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,020
it's an unopened tahini and the oil on

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,240
top of that unopened tahini is not from

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,880
those seeds I hate to give you the hard

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,100
true but it's not this is one of the

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,140
best lessons you guys can have because

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,960
the oils that are placed in all the nut

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,040
Butters declines your health this is a

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,040
tahini right here

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,100
take a look that is straight oil and

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,380
that's not from your sesame seeds this

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,640
is part of why people can't heal they

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,500
think they're doing something good for

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,900
themselves but they don't heal this is

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,240
why vegans don't heal and they go back

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,159
to eating eggs this is why vegetarians

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,439
and people who are really mindful about

44
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,299
their health this is part of why they

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,400
don't heal it's simple things like this

46
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,520
that they don't know that is pure

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,040
straight oil but not from those sesame

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,320
seeds in all the tahini bottles and jars

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,420
that you guys have is added oil that

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,360
comes from someplace else it's bulk

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,280
cheap low-grade rancid oil it's in all

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
your nut Butters and your tannies the

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,119
oil you're looking at is not from those

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
nuts or those seeds they're putting old

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,920
rancid oil that comes from bulk nuts

56
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,900
from around the planet it depreciates

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,640
your health it's not good for your heart

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,040
it's not good if you have chronic

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,560
illness people are eating all the peanut

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,319
butters all the almond butters all the

61
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,940
tahinis all the cashew Butters all the

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,800
hazelnut Butters and don't realize it

63
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,660
they're drinking drinking oil that's

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,400
declining and taking down their health

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,500
and they don't even know it this is the

66
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,420
death by a Thousand Cuts and that's why

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,160
it is absolutely critical you learn how

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,739
to make a nut butter what is the point

69
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,660
of companies to put oil in their nut

70
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,660
Butters confused while they add it

71
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,220
because they use less nuts which cost

72
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,180
the nut butter companies a lot of money

73
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:51,959
they use less nuts but bring in cheap

74
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,660
bulk oil that cost them pennies pennies

75
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,060
and then they mark up the price of your

76
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,640
nut butter jar stick it on the Shelf at

77
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,019
Whole Foods or whatever food store and

78
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,900
you pay for rancid old oil you can't be

79
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,900
sure that they're just adding plain old

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,019
oil the oil could have garbage in it

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,910
crap in it it's bulk rancid old oils in

82
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,200
every nut butter out there

83
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,120
[Music]

84
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,720
that's what nut butter is supposed to

85
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,879
look like right there mm-1500 boom why

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,640
should we even care about all that added

87
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,000
oil I'll tell you why diminishes your

88
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,819
health lowers your immune system burdens

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
your liver and your heart heavy on the

90
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,780
liver and pancreas so what I'm doing is

91
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,760
putting it in these little jars and then

92
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,500
I put a lid on it you might be able to

93
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,640
see this on a close-up too it looks

94
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,580
really cool

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,620
so I'm packing it down with my hands my

96
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,379
hands are clean I wasn't out at the post

97
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,480
office or at the store or grocery store

98
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,519
and I was opening up all kinds of doors

99
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,260
out there and had my hands on the

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,180
shopping cart and carriages and now I'm

101
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,280
putting my hands in here so I can put

102
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,959
all those

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,879
little buggies that I picked up

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,099
somewhere on my hands in here but no my

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,700
hands are clean look at that you can put

106
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,700
the lid on it

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,760
boom when you make your own nut Butters

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,760
it's a game changer
