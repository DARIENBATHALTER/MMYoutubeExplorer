[79.20 - 84.08] guys are here
[80.32 - 86.56] hello from costa rica awesome so um
[84.08 - 87.12] the morning cleanse is really like a
[86.56 - 89.84] life
[87.12 - 91.44] savior in so many ways because when we
[89.84 - 95.36] head into the holidays
[91.44 - 98.16] we end up eating a lot of things that
[95.36 - 99.84] get in front of us and we can't help it
[98.16 - 100.88] many of us are under stress during the
[99.84 - 103.20] holidays
[100.88 - 104.96] a lot of pressure during the holidays
[103.20 - 106.72] are you guys under pressure at all
[104.96 - 108.08] are you guys under any stress at all
[106.72 - 108.96] especially what's happening and what's
[108.08 - 111.04] going on
[108.96 - 112.64] and so you know the holidays are never
[111.04 - 114.64] that easy for a lot of people some
[112.64 - 116.64] people it's it's fun and easy
[114.64 - 119.04] a lot of people it's it's more than that
[116.64 - 120.64] and what happens is we end up eating a
[119.04 - 121.84] lot of different things we indulge in
[120.64 - 124.40] different things
[121.84 - 125.04] more so than usual and then we say you
[124.40 - 128.08] know what
[125.04 - 129.60] i'm just gonna come january 1st i'm just
[128.08 - 131.92] going to start fresh
[129.60 - 133.60] and we end up just you know eating
[131.92 - 135.44] whatever that's in front of us
[133.60 - 137.52] doing a whole bunch of different stuff
[135.44 - 140.64] and so what's incredible
[137.52 - 144.24] about the medical medium warning cleanse
[140.64 - 147.04] is that it's there to protect you while
[144.24 - 148.00] you're running into a lot of different
[147.04 - 152.00] food
[148.00 - 154.56] um food potholes food obstacles
[152.00 - 156.08] you know food mania whatever comes your
[154.56 - 158.40] way during the holidays
[156.08 - 161.04] so it's it that's something to think
[158.40 - 162.48] about there all on its own so
[161.04 - 164.96] and and you know people are like
[162.48 - 166.80] georgina says yep work stress so yeah so
[164.96 - 167.36] even work stress during the holidays as
[166.80 - 170.64] well
[167.36 - 172.64] so that's a big deal too and so
[170.64 - 174.08] there's a question there will uh celery
[172.64 - 177.04] juice help with the liver
[174.08 - 178.56] yes it does i talk about why and that's
[177.04 - 180.16] why i'm gonna be making some celery
[178.56 - 183.04] juice i'm gonna be making
[180.16 - 185.04] the heavy metal detox smoothie too if
[183.04 - 189.44] you guys just got on here

[205.04 - 209.60] hard to dodge food

[294.24 - 298.96] cleanse challenge so there you go
[296.88 - 300.08] and so in the morning cleanse so i'm in
[298.96 - 301.68] cleanse to heal right now
[300.08 - 303.20] in the morning cleanse it starts out
[301.68 - 307.04] with the lemon water
[303.20 - 309.60] first thing in the morning so every day
[307.04 - 310.32] okay you're eating things indulging in
[309.60 - 313.36] things
[310.32 - 315.52] that come your way every single day the
[313.36 - 317.12] liver just gets bombarded more and more
[315.52 - 320.88] the reason why
[317.12 - 323.52] people put on weight unwanted pounds
[320.88 - 325.36] during the holiday okay is because their
[323.52 - 328.00] liver is maxed out
[325.36 - 330.00] and it's being it's being basically
[328.00 - 331.68] compounded with lots of fat
[330.00 - 333.04] so what happens is if you're eating some
[331.68 - 334.72] pizza over here
[333.04 - 336.64] even if it seems like a healthier pizza
[334.72 - 337.52] or vegan pizza there's all this fat in
[336.64 - 339.36] the pizza
[337.52 - 340.72] and it's that fat that gets inside the
[339.36 - 342.40] liver and
[340.72 - 343.92] even if you're eating you know so if
[342.40 - 345.92] you're eating other things too if you're
[343.92 - 347.44] eating you know a few more eggs somebody
[345.92 - 349.12] made you a nice breakfast and it's a
[347.44 - 351.60] bunch of eggs scrambled eggs
[349.12 - 353.68] maybe you got butter on some toast maybe
[351.60 - 355.20] just doing avocado on toast and look
[353.68 - 357.92] that's a healthier fat
[355.20 - 358.56] but we do a lot of fats and our meals
[357.92 - 361.52] consist
[358.56 - 363.76] of fat every single day and so our liver
[361.52 - 367.04] is already bombarded by all this fat
[363.76 - 369.60] and when we eat fats in the morning
[367.04 - 370.64] like peanut butter almond butter coconut
[369.60 - 372.24] oil
[370.64 - 374.08] even i know somebody that eats chicken
[372.24 - 375.84] every morning like by like
[374.08 - 377.92] mid-morning they're eating chicken or
[375.84 - 379.76] bacon in the morning right
[377.92 - 382.24] or eggs in the morning or milk cheese
[379.76 - 385.36] butter all of that fat
[382.24 - 387.28] stops your liver from cleansing so it
[385.36 - 387.92] stops your liver from dumping out the
[387.28 - 390.16] trash
[387.92 - 392.56] it stops your liver from removing the
[390.16 - 395.76] toxins and poisons
[392.56 - 397.76] that actually keep us down as we get
[395.76 - 399.04] older and older and older the unwanted
[397.76 - 401.60] pounds come on
[399.04 - 403.76] the weight comes on really easy that
[401.60 - 406.40] happens like because the liver gets
[403.76 - 407.76] maxed out and one of the cool things
[406.40 - 410.08] about the morning cleanse
[407.76 - 411.68] is you can do it every day or you can do
[410.08 - 412.72] it now with the challenge right that
[411.68 - 415.20] we're doing
[412.72 - 417.12] and you're protecting your liver you're
[415.20 - 419.20] protecting your immune system
[417.12 - 421.36] you're protecting your lymphatic system
[419.20 - 423.68] because that's an offshoot of the liver
[421.36 - 425.44] you're protecting everything in your
[423.68 - 427.12] body in so many different ways you're
[425.44 - 429.28] protecting your pancreas because your
[427.12 - 431.84] pancreas gets burned down with fats too
[429.28 - 433.44] that's why people get pancreatitis and
[431.84 - 434.84] during the holidays a lot of people get
[433.44 - 436.24] gallbladder problems they get
[434.84 - 438.48] pancreatitis
[436.24 - 439.28] they get upset stomachs they get acid
[438.48 - 440.72] reflux
[439.28 - 442.16] because they're eating just a little too
[440.72 - 443.60] much of this they're having some cake
[442.16 - 445.44] they're having some cookies
[443.60 - 447.04] they're indulging in a little too much
[445.44 - 449.12] you know fats in different ways and
[447.04 - 450.48] different foods and so
[449.12 - 452.64] it's incredible about cleanse the heel
[450.48 - 455.68] there's 75 recipes in here
[452.64 - 457.36] and they're fat free and that's a big
[455.68 - 459.36] deal because you can incorporate them
[457.36 - 460.48] when you want but the morning cleanse is
[459.36 - 463.20] great because
[460.48 - 464.56] i'm not saying you shouldn't have
[463.20 - 466.16] something that you like and i'm not
[464.56 - 467.60] saying you shouldn't have avocados or
[466.16 - 469.84] guacamole i mean i make a great
[467.60 - 471.44] guacamole i love guacamole
[469.84 - 473.60] i'm not saying you can't have any of
[471.44 - 474.24] that or you can't eat a lot of chocolate
[473.60 - 476.32] okay
[474.24 - 478.00] all that fat in the chocolate and all
[476.32 - 479.76] that caffeine i'm not saying you can't
[478.00 - 481.04] have it during the holidays or anything
[479.76 - 484.16] if that's what you want to do
[481.04 - 485.68] but what i am saying is let's do the
[484.16 - 489.12] morning cleanse
[485.68 - 492.08] let's let our body heal while we're
[489.12 - 492.96] in this holiday madness of foods and
[492.08 - 495.28] eats
[492.96 - 496.56] and we're we're living with all these
[495.28 - 499.44] different foods
[496.56 - 500.24] around us and friends and family are
[499.44 - 502.32] making it for
[500.24 - 503.68] for some of us or we're just indulging
[502.32 - 505.44] more than usual because there's
[503.68 - 507.04] something that comes around the holidays
[505.44 - 508.80] i was talking to another friend and they
[507.04 - 510.72] get really sad around the holidays they
[508.80 - 511.44] get like depressed around the holidays
[510.72 - 514.08] they get
[511.44 - 514.88] depressed around christmas and around
[514.08 - 516.88] new year's
[514.88 - 518.64] and when they get depressed next thing
[516.88 - 520.32] you know it they're eating a little bit
[518.64 - 522.72] more and they're eating a little bit
[520.32 - 523.68] more and they're having some bagels and
[522.72 - 524.96] then they're having some bagels and
[523.68 - 525.76] cream cheese then they're having some
[524.96 - 528.00] donuts
[525.76 - 529.76] then they're having a few cookies and
[528.00 - 532.40] then they're having some ice cream
[529.76 - 535.04] and that's another thing too is that so
[532.40 - 537.52] many people are having ice cream
[535.04 - 538.48] even the vegan ice cream is still high
[537.52 - 540.88] in fat so
[538.48 - 542.08] even the coconut ice cream is still high
[540.88 - 544.24] in fat so
[542.08 - 546.24] everybody's kind of indulging and some
[544.24 - 548.00] people they get sad during the holidays
[546.24 - 549.44] some people get depressed so we end up
[548.00 - 552.88] eating more so you know what
[549.44 - 555.12] there's a way to protect yourself
[552.88 - 556.80] while you're going through the holiday
[555.12 - 558.16] season and that's the medical meeting

[584.72 - 590.48] with the lemon water 16 to 32 ounces
[588.08 - 591.20] of lemon water first thing in the
[590.48 - 594.40] morning
[591.20 - 596.56] when you wake up that's the best
[594.40 - 597.52] time to do it if you can so right when
[596.56 - 600.72] you wake up
[597.52 - 603.12] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water upon
[600.72 - 604.72] waking that's the key and it's as simple

[638.08 - 641.52] do it so you you can
[639.44 - 643.68] you know do a different way you can do a
[641.52 - 645.60] citrus reamer if you want or something
[643.68 - 646.16] else in order to do it but i take my
[645.60 - 648.40] hand
[646.16 - 650.80] and i squeeze it just like this and this
[648.40 - 653.76] and i'm making the lemon water right now
[650.80 - 653.76] and that's how i do it
[653.84 - 656.08] so
[657.36 - 662.88] so that's a half a lemon and you can do
[660.80 - 664.16] a half a lemon if you want and if
[662.88 - 666.08] that's something that you feel like
[664.16 - 667.76] doing that's a half that was a really
[666.08 - 669.92] juicy juicy juicy
[667.76 - 671.04] lemon is what that was it was a very
[669.92 - 673.04] juicy one
[671.04 - 674.16] so that's that right there because that
[673.04 - 676.96] lemon was so
[674.16 - 678.80] juicy that works all on its own so
[676.96 - 680.80] that's a lemon water right there
[678.80 - 681.92] now i like doing the whole lemon no
[680.80 - 685.20] matter what
[681.92 - 688.16] so i got the other half so and i'm gonna
[685.20 - 690.40] squeeze a little bit more
[688.16 - 690.40] so
[691.84 - 696.88] and there you go so that's the lemon
[694.08 - 696.88] water right there
[696.96 - 700.40] so let's talk about what it does real
[698.24 - 702.48] quick so
[700.40 - 703.60] all night long your liver is working
[702.48 - 706.00] really hard
[703.60 - 706.88] to protect you it's gathering toxins and
[706.00 - 709.20] poisons
[706.88 - 710.96] and when you hear somebody talk about
[709.20 - 713.28] toxins and poisons
[710.96 - 714.48] what does that even mean it's like oh
[713.28 - 718.00] toxins
[714.48 - 718.96] that's all that is you know like what is
[718.00 - 721.20] toxins what
[718.96 - 722.32] what are you talking about well
[721.20 - 724.96] petrochemicals
[722.32 - 726.40] plastics pharmaceuticals did you ever
[724.96 - 727.28] take a pharmaceutical have you ever
[726.40 - 729.60] taken a drug
[727.28 - 730.40] have you ever done a recreational drug
[729.60 - 732.56] because
[730.40 - 733.84] all those toxins and poisons from
[732.56 - 737.12] pharmaceuticals
[733.84 - 740.40] recreational recreational drugs
[737.12 - 743.04] petrochemicals from plastics solvents
[740.40 - 744.16] household cleaners fungicides that are
[743.04 - 746.72] on new clothes
[744.16 - 749.04] scented candles when you're breathing in
[746.72 - 751.28] all that scented candle toxin which is
[749.04 - 753.76] really one of the worst by the way
[751.28 - 754.32] just so you know scented candles is a
[753.76 - 756.08] life
[754.32 - 758.08] shortener that means if you were
[756.08 - 759.60] supposed to live to a hundred
[758.08 - 762.08] scented candles throughout your whole
[759.60 - 763.76] life will make it so you live to be 90
[762.08 - 764.64] and you'll lose 10 years that's what
[763.76 - 768.08] scented candle
[764.64 - 770.80] candles will do air fresheners are life
[768.08 - 772.72] shorteners and so we're breathing in air
[770.80 - 774.96] fresheners when we go to do you know
[772.72 - 776.32] appointments or you go somewhere or you
[774.96 - 778.24] go you know you're in a store
[776.32 - 780.08] and you're breathing in air fresheners
[778.24 - 782.08] so if you have air fresheners in your
[780.08 - 784.00] house pull them out of the walls
[782.08 - 786.40] if you have the plug-ins and toss them
[784.00 - 788.40] out if you're doing scented candles
[786.40 - 789.44] toss them out because chemical scented
[788.40 - 792.80] candles
[789.44 - 795.36] and air fresheners are quintessentially
[792.80 - 797.52] their life shorteners is what they are
[795.36 - 800.56] so if someone was supposed to be 80
[797.52 - 802.96] and and and we and they die at 80
[800.56 - 803.60] okay well they're good we're going to
[802.96 - 806.96] lose them
[803.60 - 810.32] at 70. we're going to lose them at 72
[806.96 - 813.60] we're going to lose them at 68. and
[810.32 - 814.72] that's how dangerously toxic air
[813.60 - 816.40] fresheners
[814.72 - 819.12] and scented candles are so that's just
[816.40 - 823.36] one example of how many poisons
[819.12 - 825.20] we we we actually
[823.36 - 826.64] ingest we actually breathe in we
[825.20 - 828.80] actually get in our system
[826.64 - 830.56] so when you think about toxins what kind
[828.80 - 834.16] of toxins are we talking about
[830.56 - 836.24] talking about um uh
[834.16 - 838.64] like cleaning supplies we're talking
[836.24 - 839.28] about fabric softeners we're talking
[838.64 - 840.96] about
[839.28 - 842.64] dishwashing detergents we're talking
[840.96 - 844.24] about all those different things that we
[842.64 - 845.04] might be exposed to we're talking about
[844.24 - 847.52] water
[845.04 - 849.84] in restaurants we're talking about toxic
[847.52 - 851.92] heavy metals in water in restaurants
[849.84 - 853.92] that's another thing right there too
[851.92 - 856.24] so did you ever eat in a restaurant did
[853.92 - 859.60] you ever drink water in a restaurant
[856.24 - 861.68] that water in restaurants is just
[859.60 - 863.36] city water that's filled with all kinds
[861.68 - 866.48] of stuff it's filled with pharmaceutical
[863.36 - 868.32] residue pharmaceuticals it's filled with
[866.48 - 871.76] toxic heavy metals
[868.32 - 874.48] so we have a lot of poisons and toxins
[871.76 - 876.56] and then pesticide exposure insecticide
[874.48 - 878.08] exposure fungicide exposure and i talk
[876.56 - 880.48] about it in cleansing heal i mean if you
[878.08 - 883.76] guys if you don't have this book
[880.48 - 885.36] i mean look i i would get it and if you
[883.76 - 886.88] need to get it free at the library get
[885.36 - 888.40] it free at the library take it out from
[886.88 - 891.52] the library okay
[888.40 - 891.92] um but amazon's got the 51 off on this
[891.52 - 894.80] book
[891.92 - 896.24] 16.99 for it it's it's easy to get it
[894.80 - 897.12] through amazon if you ever want to get
[896.24 - 898.48] it someday
[897.12 - 900.24] but i talk about all the different
[898.48 - 902.64] pesticides herbicides fungicides the
[900.24 - 904.88] pharmaceuticals we get exposed to
[902.64 - 906.64] and just so you know if you guys just
[904.88 - 907.52] came on here and you're just on here now
[906.64 - 909.44] i'm gonna make the
[907.52 - 910.96] heavy metal detox smoothie pretty soon i
[909.44 - 912.56] made the lemon water we're doing the
[910.96 - 914.24] medical meeting morning cleanse it's in
[912.56 - 915.68] cleanse the heel just so you know so
[914.24 - 916.48] that's the book right there cleanse the
[915.68 - 918.08] heel
[916.48 - 919.68] and i'm also going to juice the celery
[918.08 - 920.80] juice too as part of the medical medium
[919.68 - 923.12] morning cleanse
[920.80 - 924.88] so that's all in here so these
[923.12 - 928.32] troublemakers i call them are
[924.88 - 931.20] in your system so herbicides pesticides
[928.32 - 931.84] insecticides fungicides they're on new
[931.20 - 934.16] clothing
[931.84 - 936.00] they're in the air and then the
[934.16 - 936.48] chemtrails that float out down from the
[936.00 - 938.16] sky
[936.48 - 940.08] you guys heard the chemtrail episode
[938.16 - 942.64] medical medium podcast at apple podcast
[940.08 - 944.32] right i told you all about the
[942.64 - 946.08] chemtrails and how they really work and
[944.32 - 948.88] the truth about them well we breed them
[946.08 - 952.00] in every day and during the holidays
[948.88 - 953.92] they drop chemtrails on us more so
[952.00 - 955.12] than ever before during the holidays
[953.92 - 957.36] because they know people are going to be
[955.12 - 958.48] out and about and outside more in a lot
[957.36 - 960.00] of different ways
[958.48 - 961.44] so when you look up at the sky you'll
[960.00 - 962.64] see more chemtrails than you've ever
[961.44 - 965.68] seen before
[962.64 - 967.60] and all of these poisons and toxins get
[965.68 - 970.16] into our system
[967.60 - 972.00] we inhale them we ingest them we eat
[970.16 - 973.92] them we breathe them in
[972.00 - 976.24] it's plastics petrochemicals
[973.92 - 976.88] pharmaceuticals toxic heavy metals
[976.24 - 980.24] insects
[976.88 - 983.68] insecticides and pesticides so anyway
[980.24 - 986.40] that's in us so keep that in mind so
[983.68 - 988.24] every single and then there's foods then
[986.40 - 990.16] there's the foods we eat
[988.24 - 991.44] so there's lots of different foods we
[990.16 - 994.64] that have
[991.44 - 998.08] toxins in them too and not good ones so
[994.64 - 1000.16] if you've ever eaten conventional dairy
[998.08 - 1001.60] if you ever eaten conventional meat if
[1000.16 - 1003.68] you ever eaten conventional chicken you
[1001.60 - 1006.40] got the antibiotics in your system
[1003.68 - 1008.08] if you had a piece of chicken that
[1006.40 - 1010.16] wasn't organic that wasn't
[1008.08 - 1011.44] path you know that wasn't free range or
[1010.16 - 1012.80] whatever it is if you've had a piece of
[1011.44 - 1014.32] chicken from 10 years ago from a
[1012.80 - 1016.48] restaurant the antibiotics in that
[1014.32 - 1017.92] chicken still sit inside your liver
[1016.48 - 1020.08] and i'm not saying not to eat chicken
[1017.92 - 1021.36] i'm just saying those antibiotics are
[1020.08 - 1023.04] still inside your liver
[1021.36 - 1025.04] so that's how it works if you took an
[1023.04 - 1027.04] antibiotic it's still inside your liver
[1025.04 - 1027.76] if you took cold medicine from 10 years
[1027.04 - 1030.24] ago
[1027.76 - 1030.80] 15 years ago it's still inside your
[1030.24 - 1033.92] liver
[1030.80 - 1036.64] but what happens is we cannot
[1033.92 - 1037.28] get this out of our body out of our
[1036.64 - 1039.84] brain
[1037.28 - 1041.36] out of our liver and restaurant food is
[1039.84 - 1042.72] a big thing right there that's how we
[1041.36 - 1045.28] get a lot of this
[1042.72 - 1047.12] we can't get these toxins out of us if
[1045.28 - 1048.40] we have fats in the morning
[1047.12 - 1049.76] so if you have your nut butter in the
[1048.40 - 1051.44] morning which is like a healthy thing
[1049.76 - 1053.68] you got your almond butter you're making
[1051.44 - 1054.56] your smoothie you put some coconut oil
[1053.68 - 1056.00] in your smoothie
[1054.56 - 1058.80] you're never going to get the poisons
[1056.00 - 1059.92] out so you can't get the toxins out of
[1058.80 - 1061.68] your system
[1059.92 - 1063.36] you see how it works so the medical
[1061.68 - 1064.80] medium morning cleanse is not just great
[1063.36 - 1067.20] for the holidays
[1064.80 - 1069.12] it's important to do whenever you can so
[1067.20 - 1072.64] you can get these toxins and poisons
[1069.12 - 1074.08] out of your body old ones that are deep
[1072.64 - 1075.92] seeded in there you know
[1074.08 - 1077.52] antidepressants that people have taken
[1075.92 - 1078.96] in their life they sit inside the liver
[1077.52 - 1081.60] thyroid medications
[1078.96 - 1084.00] sit inside the liver anti-inflammatories
[1081.60 - 1086.32] sit inside the liver a cold medicine
[1084.00 - 1088.96] sits inside the liver antibiotics all of
[1086.32 - 1091.04] it sits down in there so great okay
[1088.96 - 1093.84] it does but let's do something about it
[1091.04 - 1097.36] so to begin with you just got on here
[1093.84 - 1101.20] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water or
[1097.36 - 1103.68] lime water right in the morning upon
[1101.20 - 1106.08] waking is the best time to do it if you
[1103.68 - 1109.12] want to add a little bit of honey
[1106.08 - 1110.80] to this lemon water you can you can add
[1109.12 - 1112.80] a little bit of honey to this lemon
[1110.80 - 1113.92] water if you really want to so that's
[1112.80 - 1118.16] okay all right
[1113.92 - 1121.04] and um but give yourself 15 to 30
[1118.16 - 1122.00] minutes before having the celery juice
[1121.04 - 1123.84] and that's where we're going
[1122.00 - 1125.20] next okay we're gonna we're gonna have
[1123.84 - 1127.76] at least 15
[1125.20 - 1128.48] to 30 minutes we head into the celery
[1127.76 - 1130.00] juice okay
[1128.48 - 1132.16] so that's the next part we're going to
[1130.00 - 1133.20] go and um
[1132.16 - 1136.40] so and then we're going to make the
[1133.20 - 1138.40] heavy metal detox smoothie pretty soon
[1136.40 - 1139.60] so we're gonna do that we're gonna head
[1138.40 - 1151.84] there too so
[1139.60 - 1151.84] i'm gonna get some celery sticks
[1153.20 - 1156.32] so i got some killer celery sticks right
[1154.96 - 1158.88] here look at this you guys
[1156.32 - 1159.76] i got a really nice big batch of them
[1158.88 - 1162.08] right here
[1159.76 - 1163.52] so i'm going to place them here for the
[1162.08 - 1164.64] moment
[1163.52 - 1166.32] or actually i'm going to place them
[1164.64 - 1167.28] right here actually it's a nice little
[1166.32 - 1169.20] spot
[1167.28 - 1170.72] and we're going to need the celery juice
[1169.20 - 1172.88] next i don't know if you guys did your
[1170.72 - 1179.84] celery juice yet today
[1172.88 - 1179.84] um but we're doing the morning cleanse
[1180.08 - 1183.20] i'm gonna pop this on
[1185.92 - 1188.16] so
[1189.36 - 1194.88] celery juice is an herbal medicine
[1191.90 - 1197.84] [Music]
[1194.88 - 1197.84] lemon water
[1198.16 - 1201.52] is a medicine
[1201.92 - 1206.64] that's what these are these are
[1204.84 - 1208.84] medicinal
[1206.64 - 1210.00] it's not that you're doing
[1208.84 - 1212.40] [Applause]
[1210.00 - 1213.60] celery and you're like okay i just had
[1212.40 - 1217.68] some celery no
[1213.60 - 1221.12] you just had straight herbal medicine
[1217.68 - 1223.28] really important to know okay
[1221.12 - 1223.28] and
[1226.32 - 1233.44] if you do it every single day your life
[1229.76 - 1236.64] will change there's a lot of reasons why
[1233.44 - 1238.00] your life will change one is because if
[1236.64 - 1241.68] you do it in the morning on an
[1238.00 - 1243.44] empty stomach 16 to 32 ounces
[1241.68 - 1245.20] okay janine you're doing yours i just
[1243.44 - 1248.08] saw that drinking cj right now
[1245.20 - 1250.40] amazing when you're doing 16 to 32
[1248.08 - 1253.04] ounces on an empty stomach
[1250.40 - 1254.48] you're not only helping your liver push
[1253.04 - 1257.84] those toxins out
[1254.48 - 1259.68] but you're neutralizing the poison and
[1257.84 - 1263.04] toxins
[1259.68 - 1266.48] it's phytochemical compounds
[1263.04 - 1271.04] sodium cluster salts in celery
[1266.48 - 1274.40] juice okay that neutralize
[1271.04 - 1275.52] the charge the toxic charge that toxins
[1274.40 - 1278.64] have
[1275.52 - 1280.24] old pharmaceuticals have a charge to
[1278.64 - 1283.36] them
[1280.24 - 1284.72] that interferes with your body's
[1283.36 - 1289.04] frequencies
[1284.72 - 1293.20] keep that in mind toxic heavy metals
[1289.04 - 1296.00] interfere with your body's frequencies
[1293.20 - 1297.84] right i know that everybody's like
[1296.00 - 1298.80] totally into the spiritual thing these
[1297.84 - 1300.64] days
[1298.80 - 1302.40] you know everybody's doing spiritual
[1300.64 - 1304.16] work they're doing you know they're
[1302.40 - 1306.00] doing spiritual growth they're doing
[1304.16 - 1307.68] spiritual techniques they're reading
[1306.00 - 1309.76] stuff they're doing stuff
[1307.68 - 1310.80] listening to podcasts all these things
[1309.76 - 1313.92] right
[1310.80 - 1314.64] but what happens is these poisons and
[1313.92 - 1318.00] toxins
[1314.64 - 1321.52] interfere with our spiritual makeup
[1318.00 - 1326.64] they interfere with our physical
[1321.52 - 1326.64] body our energy they interfere with our
[1327.60 - 1333.28] energetic frequencies because
[1331.04 - 1334.72] what happens is these these toxins and
[1333.28 - 1338.40] poisons
[1334.72 - 1341.84] they run on a very negative charge
[1338.40 - 1344.72] so they run on a very very toxic
[1341.84 - 1345.20] charge they actually have a life a shelf
[1344.72 - 1348.24] life
[1345.20 - 1352.00] toxins and poisons have
[1348.24 - 1352.64] a shelf life that becomes damaging to
[1352.00 - 1355.04] cells
[1352.64 - 1357.76] inside our body so it's important to
[1355.04 - 1361.44] know when you're doing your celery juice
[1357.76 - 1363.36] you're neutralizing those toxins
[1361.44 - 1366.08] is what you're doing you're disarming
[1363.36 - 1368.88] them because
[1366.08 - 1371.28] those toxins are on the offense they're
[1368.88 - 1372.40] out there to be destructive and damaging
[1371.28 - 1375.52] to the body
[1372.40 - 1378.16] pesticides inside your body
[1375.52 - 1379.64] fungicides herbicides toxic heavy metals
[1378.16 - 1382.64] petrochemicals
[1379.64 - 1382.64] pharmaceuticals
[1383.12 - 1387.52] solvents that come from carpet cleaning
[1385.20 - 1389.92] have you ever had your carpets cleaned
[1387.52 - 1392.08] ever have your carpets cleaned all those
[1389.92 - 1395.68] solvents and poisons
[1392.08 - 1398.80] from the carpet from the carpet cleaner
[1395.68 - 1401.76] go in to the bloodstream and they have a
[1398.80 - 1402.64] charge on them that's damaging to our
[1401.76 - 1406.24] body
[1402.64 - 1408.72] okay celery juice when it gets into
[1406.24 - 1410.48] contact with all of these poisons and
[1408.72 - 1414.40] toxins
[1410.48 - 1418.08] disarms them breaks down their charge
[1414.40 - 1419.52] diffuses them so that's what it's about
[1418.08 - 1420.40] so when people think well i did my
[1419.52 - 1421.92] celery juice
[1420.40 - 1424.16] i guess it might have helped it might
[1421.92 - 1427.04] not have helped whatever
[1424.16 - 1428.00] well guess what it did help and it is
[1427.04 - 1429.84] helping that's
[1428.00 - 1431.76] that's a part of why it gets people
[1429.84 - 1435.04] better that's why with people with
[1431.76 - 1438.00] eczema and psoriasis
[1435.04 - 1440.97] and skin problems vitiligo they have the
[1438.00 - 1442.84] charge of copper and aluminum
[1440.97 - 1444.32] [Applause]
[1442.84 - 1446.00] um
[1444.32 - 1448.96] carmen says i can't stay out of the
[1446.00 - 1450.96] bathroom and i have to work i stopped
[1448.96 - 1452.24] celery i'm assuming it's celery juice
[1450.96 - 1454.96] because i can't stop
[1452.24 - 1456.24] going if you're someone that has more
[1454.96 - 1458.40] bacteria
[1456.24 - 1460.16] in the abdomen if you have more bacteria
[1458.40 - 1461.60] in the abdomen
[1460.16 - 1464.08] you're going to be it's going to be
[1461.60 - 1466.48] shocking that bacteria that bacteria is
[1464.08 - 1469.28] toxic so when that bacteria
[1466.48 - 1471.04] explodes your body's going to want to
[1469.28 - 1472.96] rid it so
[1471.04 - 1475.52] if you're if you have that kind of thing
[1472.96 - 1477.44] going on i would consider
[1475.52 - 1479.04] a small amount of celery juice is what i
[1477.44 - 1482.56] would do i would consider a real
[1479.04 - 1482.56] small amount of celery juice
[1483.52 - 1488.00] and a smaller amount you could take baby
[1486.16 - 1489.52] steps you can just go a little bit at a
[1488.00 - 1492.24] time you can just go
[1489.52 - 1494.24] um two ounces you can go four ounces you
[1492.24 - 1495.76] can go a little bit at a time
[1494.24 - 1497.68] and that's what you can do so that's
[1495.76 - 1499.28] something that that's something that's a
[1497.68 - 1502.64] way of doing it
[1499.28 - 1504.32] the other thing is what else is
[1502.64 - 1506.56] happening with your gut
[1504.32 - 1508.16] that's the only thing you don't have any
[1506.56 - 1509.20] bloating you've never had any gut
[1508.16 - 1512.32] problems
[1509.20 - 1514.40] you've never had the runs before or they
[1512.32 - 1516.24] happening when you do other things
[1514.40 - 1518.00] keep that in mind too always kind of
[1516.24 - 1519.20] remember that if it's if everything's
[1518.00 - 1521.04] perfectly fine
[1519.20 - 1522.96] your stomach's fine everything's great
[1521.04 - 1524.80] you never had a problem with any of that
[1522.96 - 1526.56] then you drink some celery juice and you
[1524.80 - 1528.48] have the runs well that's shocking the
[1526.56 - 1530.72] bacteria that's what that is
[1528.48 - 1532.96] um but keep keep that in mind but if
[1530.72 - 1534.08] you've had other stuff too if you've had
[1532.96 - 1535.76] the runs before
[1534.08 - 1537.44] if something else triggers it other
[1535.76 - 1539.92] things are going on
[1537.44 - 1541.92] the liver a lot of stuff going on inside
[1539.92 - 1543.60] the liver so you do baby steps just to
[1541.92 - 1544.88] live this bad bacteria so you do a
[1543.60 - 1546.56] little bit at a time a little bit of
[1544.88 - 1548.48] time you start with four ounces
[1546.56 - 1550.00] you can start with that right there so
[1548.48 - 1551.36] you guys we're doing the medical medium
[1550.00 - 1553.36] morning cleanse
[1551.36 - 1554.80] and over time you'll be able to do a
[1553.36 - 1555.44] little bit more and it's a little bit
[1554.80 - 1556.96] more
[1555.44 - 1558.48] and a little bit more and a little bit
[1556.96 - 1559.20] more and that's what you can do over
[1558.48 - 1561.84] time
[1559.20 - 1562.48] and then eventually you'll be at 8
[1561.84 - 1565.60] ounces
[1562.48 - 1567.28] 12 ounces 16 ounces 20 ounces
[1565.60 - 1568.96] and you won't have the runs anymore
[1567.28 - 1571.60] because you got rid of that
[1568.96 - 1573.52] much bacteria that much of the bad
[1571.60 - 1574.56] microorganisms and that's a big thing
[1573.52 - 1577.92] there too
[1574.56 - 1579.68] don't substitute you guys celery juice
[1577.92 - 1582.24] with celery powder
[1579.68 - 1583.36] whatever you do and it's either you get
[1582.24 - 1586.16] you get the
[1583.36 - 1588.08] fresh celery juice from a juice bar
[1586.16 - 1589.76] watch out for
[1588.08 - 1592.56] celery that's already been juiced in
[1589.76 - 1595.36] containers not containers in bottles
[1592.56 - 1596.72] they got the cap on them and they're in
[1595.36 - 1598.00] the cold section of the health food
[1596.72 - 1599.60] stores and grocery stores
[1598.00 - 1601.12] and their hpp high pressure
[1599.60 - 1602.88] pasteurization and they have a long
[1601.12 - 1604.24] shelf life a long date on them
[1602.88 - 1606.32] don't use those either those are
[1604.24 - 1609.12] terrible um
[1606.32 - 1609.92] so so just keep that in mind right there
[1609.12 - 1612.24] if you can't
[1609.92 - 1613.52] if you can't get lemons you can do a
[1612.24 - 1616.16] ginger water

[1904.84 - 1907.84] there
[1908.32 - 1914.56] brain of blender so
[1911.36 - 1918.00] you guys got to remember this okay
[1914.56 - 1920.56] what happens is that when you give your
[1918.00 - 1924.56] body a chance to cleanse every morning
[1920.56 - 1927.68] and you're taking a break off the fats
[1924.56 - 1928.16] you're giving yourself more years in the
[1927.68 - 1930.48] future
[1928.16 - 1932.16] you're giving yourself a chance to live
[1930.48 - 1933.44] healthier you're giving yourself a
[1932.16 - 1935.84] chance to rid
[1933.44 - 1936.80] conditions and symptoms that you're
[1935.84 - 1938.88] dealing with so
[1936.80 - 1940.08] there's all that involved too but during
[1938.88 - 1941.92] the holidays
[1940.08 - 1944.08] this is a great way to keep the extra
[1941.92 - 1945.76] unwanted pounds from coming on
[1944.08 - 1947.60] this is a great way to protect your
[1945.76 - 1948.56] immune system to keep a strong immune
[1947.60 - 1950.80] system
[1948.56 - 1951.60] every year with all the holidays i've
[1950.80 - 1954.32] seen this over
[1951.60 - 1956.00] the last 30 years i've seen people get
[1954.32 - 1958.56] the flu during the holidays
[1956.00 - 1960.00] it's always somebody in the family
[1958.56 - 1962.64] somewhere out there and somebody's
[1960.00 - 1963.52] family that gets the flu they get kicked
[1962.64 - 1965.68] on their butt
[1963.52 - 1967.60] they got a fever they got a bad cough
[1965.68 - 1970.32] they get it around christmas time
[1967.60 - 1972.00] their immune system runs down and they
[1970.32 - 1974.16] get stuck with the flu
[1972.00 - 1976.00] and flu season starts up around that
[1974.16 - 1978.16] time and of course now we've got the the
[1976.00 - 1979.76] new problem that we have now on top of
[1978.16 - 1981.60] it so everybody's immune systems they
[1979.76 - 1983.60] get lower during the holidays
[1981.60 - 1985.28] they're eating foods that lower their
[1983.60 - 1985.84] immune system whether they know it or
[1985.28 - 1988.08] not
[1985.84 - 1989.60] they get more susceptible to you know
[1988.08 - 1991.36] the virus that's going around now they
[1989.60 - 1993.36] get more susceptible to
[1991.36 - 1994.64] flu virus they get more susceptible to
[1993.36 - 1997.52] their own viruses
[1994.64 - 1999.04] their own epstein bars shingles viruses
[1997.52 - 2001.36] that give you chronic fatigue and
[1999.04 - 2002.96] trigeminal neuralgia neck pain back pain
[2001.36 - 2006.16] migraines
[2002.96 - 2008.08] fatigue tingles and numbness floaters in
[2006.16 - 2009.60] the eyes ringing in the ears dizziness
[2008.08 - 2012.32] vertigo so they get ex
[2009.60 - 2013.60] you get susceptible to your own viruses
[2012.32 - 2014.80] that people have
[2013.60 - 2017.04] like the epstein barr causing
[2014.80 - 2018.64] hashimoto's and hypothyroid
[2017.04 - 2020.48] and all the different thyroid conditions
[2018.64 - 2023.44] and hyperthyroid and
[2020.48 - 2025.52] cysts and nodules and pcos and
[2023.44 - 2027.04] endometriosis so people already have
[2025.52 - 2028.24] enough to deal with and then you got
[2027.04 - 2030.56] outside viruses
[2028.24 - 2032.40] okay you got the covid and you got the
[2030.56 - 2033.92] flu and you got other viruses that are
[2032.40 - 2036.24] happening on the outside that
[2033.92 - 2038.32] aren't happening just on the inside of
[2036.24 - 2039.12] people so then you got that in the way
[2038.32 - 2040.80] out there
[2039.12 - 2042.64] and then the holidays come and we're
[2040.80 - 2044.64] under stress we're under pressure
[2042.64 - 2046.00] we're eating the foods we shouldn't eat
[2044.64 - 2048.72] and then our immune system
[2046.00 - 2049.52] drops drops drops our liver gets
[2048.72 - 2051.92] stressed out
[2049.52 - 2053.44] stressed out to the max and then we go
[2051.92 - 2055.04] into the winter feeling more
[2053.44 - 2057.12] sick and a lot of people it's really
[2055.04 - 2058.40] hard so that's some something right
[2057.12 - 2059.76] there just think about
[2058.40 - 2061.36] and i'm glad we're getting a chance to
[2059.76 - 2061.60] talk about this so if you guys just came
[2061.36 - 2063.20] on
[2061.60 - 2064.96] medical medium morning cleanse i'm
[2063.20 - 2066.08] making heavy metal detox smoothie right
[2064.96 - 2067.68] here
[2066.08 - 2069.76] i'm excited i'm glad we're here glad
[2067.68 - 2071.36] we're doing this so if you just came on
[2069.76 - 2074.80] here just did the medical medium
[2071.36 - 2077.20] lemon water 16 to 32 ounces
[2074.80 - 2078.72] i just did the celery juice 16 and 32
[2077.20 - 2082.88] ounces right
[2078.72 - 2084.80] and now it's time
[2082.88 - 2086.32] to make a smoothie that's what we're
[2084.80 - 2088.00] gonna do now okay
[2086.32 - 2089.60] so we can do a couple of things we could
[2088.00 - 2090.64] start out by throwing the wild
[2089.60 - 2093.84] blueberries in there
[2090.64 - 2096.88] it's two cups of frozen wild blueberries
[2093.84 - 2099.36] right there okay so i'm going to pop
[2096.88 - 2099.36] that in there
[2100.00 - 2105.52] now nobody knew what wild blueberries
[2102.56 - 2108.56] were until mm info
[2105.52 - 2110.64] and i
[2108.56 - 2111.60] i mean nobody knew they're just like
[2110.64 - 2114.48] blueberries
[2111.60 - 2115.68] no not blueberries wild blueberries yeah
[2114.48 - 2118.32] blueberries right
[2115.68 - 2120.48] no wild blueberries the little wild
[2118.32 - 2121.04] blueberries and now i'm hearing it out
[2120.48 - 2122.88] there
[2121.04 - 2124.32] it's out there on podcasts it's out
[2122.88 - 2124.72] there on youtube people are talking
[2124.32 - 2127.28] about
[2124.72 - 2128.56] wild blueberries you know and medical
[2127.28 - 2131.04] medium books
[2128.56 - 2132.56] actually blew up the whole frozen wild
[2131.04 - 2133.92] blueberry thing the whole wild liberty
[2132.56 - 2136.16] thing around the world
[2133.92 - 2136.96] so because millions of books went around
[2136.16 - 2139.36] the world
[2136.96 - 2140.80] it's the number one health books there
[2139.36 - 2143.52] is globally
[2140.80 - 2145.52] hands down for six years running i think
[2143.52 - 2147.60] is the medical medium book series
[2145.52 - 2149.76] and that's come with a lot of good stuff
[2147.60 - 2151.92] but it comes with also a lot of
[2149.76 - 2152.96] a lot of uh people that you know they
[2151.92 - 2154.80] don't like seeing
[2152.96 - 2156.08] they don't like seeing you get too many
[2154.80 - 2157.44] people better out there in the world
[2156.08 - 2158.00] because millions are healing for medical
[2157.44 - 2161.04] media books
[2158.00 - 2162.64] and that disappoints i think uh
[2161.04 - 2164.48] big pharma and stuff because then that's
[2162.64 - 2166.24] less pharmaceuticals more people get
[2164.48 - 2167.92] better on celery juice then less
[2166.24 - 2169.36] pharmaceuticals get sold
[2167.92 - 2170.88] you know you guys know the drill out
[2169.36 - 2172.32] there how it works so i got the frozen
[2170.88 - 2175.36] wild blueberries this is the heavy metal
[2172.32 - 2177.76] detox movie and what this smoothie does
[2175.36 - 2179.84] blue and l i didn't know wild
[2177.76 - 2180.40] blueberries existed before mm info
[2179.84 - 2182.24] indeed
[2180.40 - 2184.32] loon you're awesome i'm glad you're here
[2182.24 - 2185.60] incredible and um
[2184.32 - 2187.12] good to see you good to see you i'm
[2185.60 - 2189.68] still thinking about the potato poem
[2187.12 - 2192.40] that you wrote
[2189.68 - 2194.00] the night sprite that goes in there the
[2192.40 - 2195.20] potato poem you wrote that you put in
[2194.00 - 2198.16] the comment section
[2195.20 - 2198.56] it was actually a really good poem um it
[2198.16 - 2201.76] was
[2198.56 - 2203.68] it was really good okay so i got the
[2201.76 - 2206.72] frozen wild blueberries right here
[2203.68 - 2208.80] and um i'm gonna put
[2206.72 - 2210.32] two bananas in here you guys really want
[2208.80 - 2211.12] to do one banana and you can do one
[2210.32 - 2214.16] banana
[2211.12 - 2216.16] all right it's okay bananas are an
[2214.16 - 2217.60] incredible food great for the digestive
[2216.16 - 2220.08] system great for the liver
[2217.60 - 2221.12] glucose for the brain potassium for the
[2220.08 - 2223.44] brain
[2221.12 - 2225.36] if you hear somebody go like oh too much
[2223.44 - 2228.08] potassium too much potassium
[2225.36 - 2228.88] if you hear that you got to know one
[2228.08 - 2232.40] thing
[2228.88 - 2235.40] potassium is one of those little
[2232.40 - 2236.88] powerful minerals those little powerful
[2235.40 - 2239.44] electrolytes
[2236.88 - 2241.36] critical for the brain to function so
[2239.44 - 2242.88] take potassium out of the equation and
[2241.36 - 2245.84] your brain goes
[2242.88 - 2246.96] short circuits that's how it works so so
[2245.84 - 2248.40] when you hear someone
[2246.96 - 2250.32] that's that's kind of misinformation
[2248.40 - 2252.56] that's always out there there's just
[2250.32 - 2253.84] so much bad misinformation it's like
[2252.56 - 2256.32] bananas are bad
[2253.84 - 2258.00] potassium too much potassium too much
[2256.32 - 2260.48] this okay sure
[2258.00 - 2261.04] whatever okay just stop people from
[2260.48 - 2262.72] healing
[2261.04 - 2264.80] just keep on stop people from healing
[2262.72 - 2266.56] it's unbelievable so yeah so there's two
[2264.80 - 2269.52] bananas in here right there um
[2266.56 - 2270.48] a cup of cilantro i'm just gonna put you
[2269.52 - 2272.40] know

[2484.96 - 2488.64] reverse and reverse and reverse to the
[2486.88 - 2490.72] point where you know your name now
[2488.64 - 2492.84] does that matter well yeah that's what
[2490.72 - 2495.84] i'm talking about
[2492.84 - 2497.20] lunelle um
[2495.84 - 2499.68] you're saying all i can tell you is that
[2497.20 - 2500.56] the info is real the real deal i'm not
[2499.68 - 2502.72] supposed to eat
[2500.56 - 2505.12] cold foods either yet i'm healing with
[2502.72 - 2506.80] the mm info
[2505.12 - 2508.72] i also stopped being chronically cold
[2506.80 - 2510.24] see belief systems
[2508.72 - 2513.20] i gotta tell you something about belief
[2510.24 - 2515.68] systems okay belief systems
[2513.20 - 2517.92] in health i have nothing against them
[2515.68 - 2519.68] but when someone says well
[2517.92 - 2521.44] there's this and then there's this and
[2519.68 - 2522.00] there's this out there well people don't
[2521.44 - 2524.48] know like there's
[2522.00 - 2526.08] fodmap and then you know you're not
[2524.48 - 2527.92] allowed to eat cold food because someone
[2526.08 - 2530.08] tells you that you got dampness
[2527.92 - 2532.56] you know because that's that's you know
[2530.08 - 2534.80] a traditional chinese medicine
[2532.56 - 2537.36] concept whatever the concept is out
[2534.80 - 2540.32] there whether it's western eastern
[2537.36 - 2542.64] it's all man-made it's man-made medical
[2540.32 - 2544.96] medium information is not man-made
[2542.64 - 2546.64] um i'm just a messenger so i'm just
[2544.96 - 2547.92] letting you know so you know what this
[2546.64 - 2550.16] is about so
[2547.92 - 2551.92] and here's what's crazy as far as
[2550.16 - 2552.40] medical medium information has become a
[2551.92 - 2554.96] law
[2552.40 - 2556.64] in natural health there's so many pieces
[2554.96 - 2558.48] of it out there now
[2556.64 - 2560.40] that doesn't come from a study or
[2558.48 - 2561.52] anything it comes from these books but
[2560.40 - 2564.32] yet doctors
[2561.52 - 2564.88] consider it law now it's like holistic
[2564.32 - 2566.96] law
[2564.88 - 2568.72] so there's so many tools being used
[2566.96 - 2571.04] celery juice being one of them
[2568.72 - 2572.48] that doesn't that wasn't out there

[2601.44 - 2606.24] medical medium information
[2602.88 - 2608.72] it comes from above since i was age 4
[2606.24 - 2610.32] i'm just the messenger that's why more
[2608.72 - 2611.36] people have healed of medical medium
[2610.32 - 2614.00] information
[2611.36 - 2615.68] than anything else in holistic health

[2624.00 - 2627.36] conditions and diseases with celery
[2625.92 - 2628.96] juice and other medical medium tools
[2627.36 - 2631.60] than any other place
[2628.96 - 2632.56] on the planet i'm not boasting i'm just
[2631.60 - 2635.20] talking about
[2632.56 - 2636.16] the fact and the results and the street
[2635.20 - 2639.52] cred
[2636.16 - 2642.08] that's all i'm talking about um you know
[2639.52 - 2642.56] so i mean you can call it what you want
[2642.08 - 2645.44] it but
[2642.56 - 2645.92] it's what it is and it's really a great
[2645.44 - 2647.04] thing
[2645.92 - 2648.32] it's really a great thing you guys have
[2647.04 - 2650.16] put orange in there and now i'm going to
[2648.32 - 2652.96] put a little bit of dolson here
[2650.16 - 2654.96] a little strip of dulce right here so
[2652.96 - 2657.20] this is atlantic dulce
[2654.96 - 2658.72] it's part of the five things in here
[2657.20 - 2660.48] that get you better
[2658.72 - 2662.80] this is the medical medium heavy metal
[2660.48 - 2665.44] detox smoothie you're looking right here
[2662.80 - 2666.16] it's already saved lives and change
[2665.44 - 2667.92] lives
[2666.16 - 2669.60] it's around the world and people are
[2667.92 - 2670.80] using it so i'm also going to put a
[2669.60 - 2672.48] couple of other things in here this is
[2670.80 - 2674.32] barley grass juice powder now this is
[2672.48 - 2675.76] the vimergy barley grass juice powder
[2674.32 - 2679.28] it's the only one i trust
[2675.76 - 2681.92] v is in victor i m as in mary e-r-g-y
[2679.28 - 2683.92] okay that's the only one i trust it's
[2681.92 - 2685.60] the best one there ever is out there if
[2683.92 - 2687.60] there was a better one i would use it
[2685.60 - 2689.36] if there's a better one i would use it
[2687.60 - 2690.72] simple as that putting a teaspoon of the
[2689.36 - 2692.16] barley grass juice powder in here
[2690.72 - 2693.28] because it's part of how you get the
[2692.16 - 2696.24] metals out
[2693.28 - 2697.76] so there's the barley grass juice powder
[2696.24 - 2700.88] right there
[2697.76 - 2704.88] so now i'm going to do the spirulina now
[2700.88 - 2706.96] i used to like uh pacific spirulina
[2704.88 - 2708.32] i don't like it anymore because it's not
[2706.96 - 2711.12] the best quality
[2708.32 - 2712.08] in my opinion it's not the best quality
[2711.12 - 2714.96] i've ever seen
[2712.08 - 2716.56] is the kind that vimergy has and that's
[2714.96 - 2717.36] the best quality spirulina i've ever
[2716.56 - 2719.04] seen
[2717.36 - 2720.24] so i'm putting a teaspoon of spirulina
[2719.04 - 2721.92] in here too if you don't know the
[2720.24 - 2725.12] company is v is in victor i
[2721.92 - 2729.52] am as in mary e-r-g-y go to vimorgy.com
[2725.12 - 2731.12] i'm not sponsored very important to know
[2729.52 - 2733.12] not sponsored by any of the companies
[2731.12 - 2734.40] that i show like these product companies
[2733.12 - 2736.00] like these supplements and all that
[2734.40 - 2736.32] stuff i like lots of supplements out

[2753.04 - 2758.72] too
[2754.72 - 2761.36] but by far the best stuff on the market
[2758.72 - 2762.40] i've ever found out all the companies
[2761.36 - 2764.72] and brands
[2762.40 - 2766.32] that i've actually vetted this is the
