[0.00 - 5.16] that in mind
[1.68 - 6.54] that it's possible their ego could rise
[5.16 - 8.64] up there's a lot of people out there to
[6.54 - 11.94] be like I don't have an ego
[8.64 - 13.92] no way I I'm totally not eager I don't
[11.94 - 16.20] have the ego and then
[13.92 - 19.08] there but then
[16.20 - 22.14] you can see it it'll rise up it'll rise
[19.08 - 26.34] up this is another thing the ego that's
[22.14 - 30.36] it that's in everyone can be dormant
[26.34 - 32.10] someone can have a dormant ego
[30.36 - 34.20] isn't that interesting I swear to
[32.10 - 37.86] compassion told me that that
[34.20 - 39.72] ego can be in its dormancy
[37.86 - 41.40] in someone
[39.72 - 44.70] how incredible that piece of information
[41.40 - 46.68] is alone that's for the compassion uh
[44.70 - 48.90] has taught me it's like what do you mean
[46.68 - 51.90] in its dormancy what do you mean by that
[48.90 - 54.18] like how is an ego in its dormancy some
[51.90 - 55.92] someone please tell me right like what
[54.18 - 59.16] and
[55.92 - 61.44] Spirit of compassion was like
[59.16 - 64.38] dormancy meaning
[61.44 - 68.58] it's in its infancy in some people too
[64.38 - 71.76] that's incredible so an ego can develop
[68.58 - 72.90] you mean it can actually be in it in its
[71.76 - 74.28] infancy
[72.90 - 77.52] and then
[74.28 - 80.52] develop as time goes on
[77.52 - 84.30] so it's one way somebody's ego can grow
[80.52 - 87.48] another way is they can have
[84.30 - 90.54] strong ego deep down inside
[87.48 - 93.72] but it doesn't get Unleashed
[90.54 - 96.74] until a trigger moment so that's another
[93.72 - 98.78] thing too someone can have this
[96.74 - 104.04] big
[98.78 - 106.26] dark ego deep down inside
[104.04 - 109.20] and it's there
[106.26 - 113.10] and it doesn't peek its head out and
[109.20 - 114.54] then it experience or a huge trigger can
[113.10 - 116.82] occur
[114.54 - 119.22] and then it just gets Unleashed and just
[116.82 - 121.62] explodes
[119.22 - 123.36] interesting right
[121.62 - 127.08] someone said
[123.36 - 129.60] fiddle stick said so true
[127.08 - 130.80] okay so I'm reading out of brain saver

[151.86 - 154.98] shifter a little bit later so hang on
[153.84 - 156.12] for that because it's going to be fun
[154.98 - 158.04] we're going to read a little bit about
[156.12 - 160.44] the ego shifter
[158.04 - 162.54] all right
[160.44 - 166.28] so let's get into it I'm excited about
[162.54 - 166.28] this I'm gonna go to page
[166.40 - 172.32] 576. you guys 576 of brain saver here I
[170.52 - 175.94] am
[172.32 - 175.94] when everything changes
[176.34 - 182.34] the not so sick
[178.92 - 183.84] fall every day and become the sick
[182.34 - 186.18] do you know anybody who's the not so
[183.84 - 189.06] sick I just wanted to ask you guys The
[186.18 - 190.86] Not So Sick is someone who they're not
[189.06 - 192.36] chronically ill
[190.86 - 194.52] but they might have a chronic symptom
[192.36 - 196.92] maybe they get a headache once in a
[194.52 - 198.60] while maybe they feel kind of low once
[196.92 - 200.70] in a while maybe they have a mild mild
[198.60 - 203.10] depression maybe they have a little bit
[200.70 - 206.04] of acne maybe their stomach bloats up
[203.10 - 207.60] and they get a they get a stomach bloat
[206.04 - 209.04] here and there
[207.60 - 210.66] and then they go to their functional
[209.04 - 213.84] medicine doctor and they go to another
[210.66 - 216.36] guy and another guy and they get a
[213.84 - 218.64] little tune up they get told stay off of
[216.36 - 220.32] processed foods then they're back in
[218.64 - 222.18] Action right then they're trying this
[220.32 - 223.86] and trying that they're doing cod liver
[222.18 - 225.42] oil they're doing whatever fish oil
[223.86 - 229.14] they're doing microbiome stuff whatever
[225.42 - 230.70] it is and that's the not so sick you
[229.14 - 232.02] know there's different degrees of not so
[230.70 - 233.94] sick keep that in mind there's different
[232.02 - 235.92] degrees of not so sick
[233.94 - 237.90] and then there's the sick right
[235.92 - 240.30] chronically ill that's when we're sick
[237.90 - 244.50] there's that's a whole entire level of
[240.30 - 246.48] degree that's when we're like sick right
[244.50 - 248.34] so when everything changes so I'll just
[246.48 - 250.38] read a little bit of this The Not So
[248.34 - 252.42] Sick fall every day
[250.38 - 254.22] and become the sick and that's the thing
[252.42 - 255.78] that you got to think about you'll see
[254.22 - 257.88] people they're not so sick they're not
[255.78 - 260.46] so sick and they weigh back and forth
[257.88 - 262.80] and then their scale tips
[260.46 - 265.74] and when they're scale tips
[262.80 - 268.26] they get sicker they get sick so they go
[265.74 - 270.48] from not so sick to sick right they
[268.26 - 272.76] start out with some acne and they get a
[270.48 - 275.04] couple of bad colds once in a while and
[272.76 - 277.28] they feel a little bit of fatigue and
[275.04 - 279.84] then comes the day when they're like
[277.28 - 281.58] neurological problems aches and pains
[279.84 - 283.80] tingles and numbness barely function
[281.58 - 286.62] brain fog in the worst way and now
[283.80 - 289.82] they've gone from the sick the not so
[286.62 - 289.82] sick too sick
[290.00 - 294.56] that's commonly when the realizations
[292.86 - 297.36] come
[294.56 - 299.52] interesting I've seen people that were
[297.36 - 302.58] just not so sick
[299.52 - 305.94] and then they get sick and then the
[302.58 - 308.76] realizations come
[305.94 - 311.28] the fall they take brings them to a new
[308.76 - 312.18] Awakening about how they perceive the
[311.28 - 314.22] world
[312.18 - 316.68] interesting right you take somebody
[314.22 - 318.36] who's seasoned you guys know take
[316.68 - 319.86] somebody who's really seasoned you've
[318.36 - 322.08] been there you've done that how many
[319.86 - 324.54] doctors have you been to how many
[322.08 - 326.52] practitioners have you been to how many
[324.54 - 330.24] different things have you tried

[337.92 - 342.36] cardiologist this cardiologist this
[339.96 - 344.76] doctor to numbness on the body right
[342.36 - 347.84] your legs feel like sand bags you got
[344.76 - 351.60] the worst brain fog you got twitches and
[347.84 - 354.00] spasms and ticks you got vibrations and
[351.60 - 356.46] Tremors and you feel like you're just
[354.00 - 358.32] you can't get like in your own way
[356.46 - 360.12] because you're just you're you can't
[358.32 - 362.16] even move
[360.12 - 363.90] how many people have been through all
[362.16 - 366.24] that sick as a dog right I just saw that
[363.90 - 368.82] now in IG sick as a dog been through so
[366.24 - 370.14] much okay
[368.82 - 372.72] so
[370.14 - 374.10] you know how you perceive the world you
[372.72 - 375.72] know what you're seeing in the world
[374.10 - 377.58] your Seasons you've been there you've
[375.72 - 380.64] done that you've been through a lot
[377.58 - 382.80] you've been kicked down you got sick
[380.64 - 384.66] could not find answers you've been
[382.80 - 387.00] everywhere there's that crowd right
[384.66 - 389.04] wondering wishing says yes a lot of my
[387.00 - 392.10] neighbors are not so sick and can't
[389.04 - 393.96] believe our kids do brain shots seller
[392.10 - 396.60] juice dot dot dot
[393.96 - 399.54] I totally understand
[396.60 - 401.22] Phyllis Lombardi I used to be the not so
[399.54 - 404.10] sick in absolutely different degrees
[401.22 - 407.22] different degrees of not so sick this is
[404.10 - 409.26] an incredible topic really Hannity oh
[407.22 - 410.94] man I remember the day my scale tipped
[409.26 - 413.28] exactly
[410.94 - 415.68] the scale tips Everything Changes it
[413.28 - 417.66] changes how we perceive the world this
[415.68 - 419.94] is a big deal educating myself says it's
[417.66 - 424.56] a real humble sandwich
[419.94 - 427.32] so true so true Hannity says I was I was
[424.56 - 430.92] not so sick for years the fall was
[427.32 - 434.64] absolutely my Awakening this is so true
[430.92 - 437.22] it is isn't it the words in here they
[434.64 - 439.92] match what you guys experience and and
[437.22 - 442.74] and have felt so one thing about Spirit
[439.92 - 444.78] of compassion knowing where people are
[442.74 - 446.88] and what happens with when we get
[444.78 - 450.78] chronically sick
[446.88 - 453.90] the fall The Not So Sick take
[450.78 - 456.12] when they become sick brings them to a
[453.90 - 458.16] new Awakening about how they perceive
[456.12 - 460.80] the world and then
[458.16 - 464.52] that's when it's like what
[460.80 - 466.92] until then The Not So Sick may feel safe
[464.52 - 470.16] and secure I mean you see it out there
[466.92 - 472.80] right The Not So Sick they feel safe
[470.16 - 474.30] they feel secure and I'm glad they do I
[472.80 - 476.70] want them to feel safe and secure
[474.30 - 479.58] they're not so sick they're not so sick
[476.70 - 481.92] you know where okay they get a UTI they
[479.58 - 484.32] run to the doctor they get an antibiotic
[481.92 - 485.82] they're a pastor UTI okay up and running
[484.32 - 487.14] again
[485.82 - 489.54] they get
[487.14 - 491.40] um a migraine once in a while right and
[489.54 - 492.72] they're like oh okay but back in Action
[491.40 - 494.94] all is good
[492.72 - 497.40] they you know
[494.94 - 499.74] they get some acne
[497.40 - 501.78] they catch a cold they get a cough
[499.74 - 504.12] that's temporary right whatever The Not
[501.78 - 505.62] So Sick are or they get a rash that's
[504.12 - 508.14] really mild
[505.62 - 509.58] and it waves from going back and forth
[508.14 - 512.82] waivers from going back and forth from
[509.58 - 515.72] worse to to not so bad whatever The Not
[512.82 - 515.72] So Sick are up against
[515.82 - 522.12] I'm in the page number 576 on medical
[519.42 - 524.40] meaning brain saver that's where I am
[522.12 - 526.98] and I'm in
[524.40 - 529.68] until then The Not So Sick may feel safe
[526.98 - 532.50] and secure in how they've gotten
[529.68 - 535.08] they're minor or temporary symptoms
[532.50 - 537.42] under control are solved
[535.08 - 538.32] I solve that symptom my brain fog's
[537.42 - 541.26] better
[538.32 - 543.78] it wasn't that bad to begin with but my
[541.26 - 547.44] brain fog is better I solved that
[543.78 - 550.08] symptom I'm feeling stronger my adrenals
[547.44 - 552.36] feel stronger I went to a doctor a
[550.08 - 554.30] practitioner they gave me some vitamins
[552.36 - 558.48] told me to eat better and get some rest
[554.30 - 562.40] I got my you know aches and pains better
[558.48 - 562.40] I feel I'm normal again
[562.68 - 566.64] so until then The Not So Sick may feel
[564.90 - 568.56] safe and secure in how they've gotten
[566.64 - 571.08] their minor or temporary symptoms under
[568.56 - 573.60] control or solved they feel confident
[571.08 - 575.58] because they tend to find some help in
[573.60 - 579.06] the form of a functional medicine doctor
[575.58 - 581.58] or practitioner or chiropractor who
[579.06 - 583.62] purports to specialize in more advanced
[581.58 - 586.14] Natural Health Care so they go to this
[583.62 - 589.44] guy and it seems like hey
[586.14 - 591.18] you know they're they're um they know
[589.44 - 593.04] their business this functional doctor
[591.18 - 595.74] knows their stuff
[593.04 - 599.64] this this chiropractor knows his stuff
[595.74 - 603.36] he purports to be a expert in the field
[599.64 - 605.16] of of chronic conditions and I went to
[603.36 - 606.54] him and now I'm better and I want people
[605.16 - 609.18] to go see their doctors of course and I
[606.54 - 611.78] went to them and they're better
[609.18 - 611.78] I'm better
[612.08 - 616.74] when they find these Health Care
[614.04 - 618.54] Providers the not so sick people are at
[616.74 - 620.46] the beginning of the learning curve
[618.54 - 623.16] isn't it interesting on IG I see
[620.46 - 625.68] something from Elena this is this was me
[623.16 - 628.46] until one day everything changed
[625.68 - 628.46] completely understand
[630.06 - 635.04] when The Not So Sick find these health
[633.12 - 637.20] care providers
[635.04 - 639.78] the not so sick people are at the
[637.20 - 642.90] beginning of the learning curve the
[639.78 - 644.64] beginning of the learning curve
[642.90 - 647.64] you're getting symptoms for the first
[644.64 - 650.10] time you're not so sick you find a
[647.64 - 652.50] health care provider seems to know his
[650.10 - 654.96] or her's business really good you go
[652.50 - 657.06] there you start perking up your body
[654.96 - 660.56] recovers
[657.06 - 660.56] you're moving past it
[660.60 - 665.10] and what they learned from their doctor
[662.40 - 667.62] or practitioner is new to them
[665.10 - 669.78] whoa vitamin D I can take a high dosage
[667.62 - 672.18] of vitamin D doctor so and so well
[669.78 - 674.46] that's new to me oh wait a minute krill
[672.18 - 676.50] oil instead of fish oil that's new to me
[674.46 - 679.20] Dr so-and-so
[676.50 - 681.24] um oh this microbiome test oh it shows
[679.20 - 683.28] that my bacteria isn't that great but my
[681.24 - 686.52] microbes are okay here but not here oh
[683.28 - 689.34] that's new to me Dr so-and-so
[686.52 - 692.22] they're not sick enough these not so
[689.34 - 696.36] sick people are not sick enough yet to
[692.22 - 699.36] find out these may not be the answers
[696.36 - 701.34] because their scale hasn't tipped
[699.36 - 703.86] just slain
[701.34 - 707.88] I just got some x-rays last week of my
[703.86 - 710.10] spine as I was years ago I would need to
[707.88 - 713.22] see a chiropractor perpetually
[710.10 - 715.08] now he told me I am 90 better all since
[713.22 - 718.44] having changed to Medical medium diet
[715.08 - 719.94] and protocols God bless you I'm so happy
[718.44 - 722.34] you're here and happy you're you're
[719.94 - 724.76] doing better truly because that's what
[722.34 - 724.76] it's all about
[729.24 - 732.56] the not so sick
[735.08 - 741.36] ngoc says I was a not so sick suddenly
[739.44 - 742.38] celery juice and lemon water is not
[741.36 - 745.02] enough
[742.38 - 748.62] totally I get it when that happens now I
[745.02 - 751.62] am taking around 15 Bemidji vitamins it
[748.62 - 752.52] made such a difference with the brain
[751.62 - 755.40] shots
[752.52 - 757.80] I'm not addicted to coffee anymore and
[755.40 - 759.14] people ask me what do I do like what do
[757.80 - 762.84] I do
[759.14 - 763.92] I don't want to become a not so sick
[762.84 - 767.10] person
[763.92 - 770.88] I don't want to become a sick person
[767.10 - 774.18] can I become a sick person
[770.88 - 777.06] I burn myself to the ground
[774.18 - 779.94] so anything's possible
[777.06 - 782.28] because the amount of stress I'm under
[779.94 - 784.74] the amount of fires I have to die out
[782.28 - 786.42] I'm up against so much that people don't
[784.74 - 787.56] even know the communities don't even
[786.42 - 789.42] know the medical medium communities
[787.56 - 790.92] don't even know
[789.42 - 793.98] and
[790.92 - 796.74] so I take care of myself right I have to
[793.98 - 798.96] I have to use medical medium tools
[796.74 - 802.32] that's what I have to do
[798.96 - 805.38] like when I when I put together the
[802.32 - 807.60] brain saver books I was doing 20 22 hour

[890.58 - 895.56] I'm working my butt off Agostino says aw
[893.58 - 897.90] must be spiritually challenged by
[895.56 - 899.88] Darkness often
[897.90 - 903.80] word
[899.88 - 903.80] Agostino word
[908.04 - 913.20] and me I'm burning through electrolytes

[913.20 - 917.94] I'm eating minerals up like burning
[916.68 - 920.40] through them
[917.94 - 922.74] my brain is like going I hear Spirit of
[920.40 - 925.20] compassion every minute
[922.74 - 927.06] the stress of that
[925.20 - 929.58] I'm thinking
[927.06 - 932.04] because I'm My Own being it's not only
[929.58 - 933.84] do I hear Spirit of compassion
[932.04 - 937.20] and the wisdom and the words and spirit
[933.84 - 939.96] of compassion I'm my own self I I have
[937.20 - 942.54] to hear my own brain like everybody has
[939.96 - 945.06] to hear their own brain
[942.54 - 946.98] I'm not just going
[945.06 - 950.60] to self-care appointments all day long
[946.98 - 950.60] I'm not getting massages
[950.88 - 955.50] I'm not getting facials I'm not relaxing
[953.64 - 958.38] in a spa ah I would love that nice
[955.50 - 960.00] facial I would love that nice massage
[958.38 - 963.48] I'm not on the beach
[960.00 - 966.60] you know getting some Sun every day
[963.48 - 968.46] the point I'm trying to say is that
[966.60 - 970.68] I don't want to be a not so sick person
[968.46 - 972.72] and I don't want to be a sick person I
[970.68 - 975.24] want to be strong I want to make sure
[972.72 - 978.72] that I keep myself
[975.24 - 981.18] above board up to par so I can deliver
[978.72 - 983.22] and be the messenger that I have to be
[981.18 - 985.02] and so I know when I read your comment
[983.22 - 986.64] you said you celery juice wasn't enough
[985.02 - 988.68] you were not so sick and then celery
[986.64 - 990.36] juice wasn't enough anymore you had to
[988.68 - 991.80] venture on and I'm I'm really proud of
[990.36 - 994.80] you by the way you had to venture on
[991.80 - 997.26] into customizing and doing medical
[994.80 - 998.76] medium protocols and moving forward and
[997.26 - 1001.58] you said you had to do 50 you were doing
[998.76 - 1003.68] 15 Bemidji supplements I'm doing that
[1001.58 - 1005.60] too because of all the reasons I was
[1003.68 - 1007.52] just explaining I don't want to be I
[1005.60 - 1009.14] have to be Pro proactive I don't want to
[1007.52 - 1011.54] be a sick person and I don't want to be
[1009.14 - 1013.40] a not so sick person either so I don't
[1011.54 - 1014.96] want to be that either so that's why you
[1013.40 - 1016.64] know these are here
[1014.96 - 1018.62] that's why they're here and that's why
[1016.64 - 1021.08] I'm taking them I take them in the
[1018.62 - 1023.80] morning and everything and
[1021.08 - 1023.80] at night
[1027.50 - 1031.40] when The Not So Sick find these Health
[1029.78 - 1034.46] Care Providers out there when they're
[1031.40 - 1036.98] not so sick okay they can get some tips
[1034.46 - 1037.94] and tricks stay off of this stay off of
[1036.98 - 1040.58] that
[1037.94 - 1043.06] get some more rest here's here's some
[1040.58 - 1043.06] vitamins
[1044.66 - 1048.50] not so sick people are at the beginning
[1046.58 - 1051.20] of their learning curve that's the whole
[1048.50 - 1054.08] thing they're at the beginning of their
[1051.20 - 1056.06] learning curve
[1054.08 - 1058.94] and what they learned from their doctor
[1056.06 - 1061.28] or practitioner is new to them and like
[1058.94 - 1063.08] I was saying before also krill oil is
[1061.28 - 1064.64] better than fish oil cod liver oil okay
[1063.08 - 1066.56] I'll take krill oil I just learned that
[1064.64 - 1069.44] oh vitamin D I can take a whole bunch of
[1066.56 - 1072.26] vitamin D okay good I'll take that right
[1069.44 - 1074.84] and they learn their their newbies right
[1072.26 - 1076.04] and they learn these Basics which is
[1074.84 - 1077.60] really interesting how it works they
[1076.04 - 1079.40] learn these basics
[1077.60 - 1080.96] and it's like okay and they start
[1079.40 - 1082.40] feeling a little better because they're
[1080.96 - 1084.32] starting to take care of themselves a
[1082.40 - 1086.48] little bit right oh stay away from fried
[1084.32 - 1089.30] greasy Foods all right that sounds good
[1086.48 - 1090.98] I won't eat as much pizza I won't eat as
[1089.30 - 1092.72] much whatever I'll stay away from
[1090.98 - 1095.18] processed foods so they're not so sick
[1092.72 - 1097.52] it's a learning curve they go from that
[1095.18 - 1099.74] conventional mindset and now they're
[1097.52 - 1102.02] like they're starting to do that they're
[1099.74 - 1103.82] not sick enough yet to find out these
[1102.02 - 1105.32] may not be the answers because the
[1103.82 - 1106.88] problems they're dealing with are
[1105.32 - 1109.04] manageable did you hear that you guys
[1106.88 - 1110.96] manageable the problems that they're
[1109.04 - 1113.18] dealing with are manageable
[1110.96 - 1116.96] think about that
[1113.18 - 1119.36] so they're manageable problems
[1116.96 - 1122.90] when you get too sick in the scale tips
[1119.36 - 1125.24] the problems aren't manageable so much
[1122.90 - 1126.92] anymore that's something people don't
[1125.24 - 1129.32] realize
[1126.92 - 1131.78] because the problems The Not So Sick are
[1129.32 - 1133.46] dealing with are manageable isn't it
[1131.78 - 1135.58] interesting well Macaulay neurological
[1133.46 - 1137.72] symptoms are so humbling oh my God
[1135.58 - 1140.84] neurological symptoms
[1137.72 - 1142.54] are so humbling
[1140.84 - 1146.18] they
[1142.54 - 1149.36] beat the pants off of people
[1146.18 - 1152.18] they are so humbling Corinne Angelina
[1149.36 - 1154.82] says I'm the Newbie laugh out loud
[1152.18 - 1158.06] Corinne thank you for being here
[1154.82 - 1160.34] I welcome newbies hang in there
[1158.06 - 1162.62] I won't bring Dr Nesbitt out
[1160.34 - 1164.78] Kareem Angelina says I'm slowly starting
[1162.62 - 1166.52] to feel a lot better thank God Karina I
[1164.78 - 1169.16] won't bring Dr Nesbitt out because Dr
[1166.52 - 1172.70] Nesbitt will make you probably say I'm
[1169.16 - 1174.50] not following medical medium anymore
[1172.70 - 1176.78] all right
[1174.50 - 1179.96] so someone said what's propolis good for
[1176.78 - 1181.58] I mean I can only tell you this
[1179.96 - 1182.96] about I don't want to I don't want to
[1181.58 - 1184.52] make this about propolis today or
[1182.96 - 1186.32] anything like that I mean I know it's
[1184.52 - 1188.54] critical to talk about propolis it's
[1186.32 - 1190.16] critical to talk about zinc
[1188.54 - 1191.96] it's critical it's critical to talk
[1190.16 - 1194.06] about that people are sick and getting
[1191.96 - 1196.10] sicker and we can talk about it later
[1194.06 - 1197.66] today or on a telegram or something go
[1196.10 - 1199.88] to my telegram I could leave a message
[1197.66 - 1202.06] there for everybody exclusive message or
[1199.88 - 1202.06] something
[1203.60 - 1208.70] The Not So Sick are not sick enough to
[1206.66 - 1211.34] find out that there really aren't good
[1208.70 - 1213.92] enough answers yet because the problems
[1211.34 - 1216.38] The Not So Sick are deal faced with are
[1213.92 - 1219.02] manageable I know I said that but I have
[1216.38 - 1221.42] to say it again because it's so true
[1219.02 - 1224.12] Michelle says mattress Island here
[1221.42 - 1226.16] mattress Island
[1224.12 - 1228.44] they're manageable enough that they seem
[1226.16 - 1231.98] to be partially or even temporarily
[1228.44 - 1234.86] solved by what seems to be smart Cutting
[1231.98 - 1237.32] Edge thinking and Alternative Health
[1234.86 - 1239.96] it's so smart Alternative Health it's
[1237.32 - 1242.48] Cutting Edge the problems that they had
[1239.96 - 1246.50] were not that problematic so they were
[1242.48 - 1248.78] manageable and even temporarily fixed so
[1246.50 - 1251.84] now alternative medicine is literally
[1248.78 - 1253.64] like the gold star it's like it knows
[1251.84 - 1255.98] everything it feels when you're not so
[1253.64 - 1259.16] sick think about that
[1255.98 - 1262.52] Jennifer Cockrell says my daughter has
[1259.16 - 1264.86] migraines almost daily I'm so sorry and
[1262.52 - 1267.32] she just refuses to do anything about it
[1264.86 - 1271.06] it's just become normal to her like it

[1336.62 - 1343.04] everybody believes but man

[1452.30 - 1456.98] I get exercise a little bit more take a
[1455.30 - 1458.36] little bit of a break maybe I'll take

[1478.28 - 1484.22] it's all confidence boosting because
[1480.98 - 1486.50] you're not so sick it's confident
[1484.22 - 1489.32] boosting because you're not so sick
[1486.50 - 1491.66] that's the reality right there you can
[1489.32 - 1496.28] still exercise
[1491.66 - 1499.70] you can still exercise why am I hanging
[1496.28 - 1501.86] on that one note right there how come aw
[1499.70 - 1504.68] why are you sitting on that you can
[1501.86 - 1506.60] still exercise
[1504.68 - 1507.80] because we you know why because when you
[1506.60 - 1511.48] get too sick
[1507.80 - 1511.48] you can't exercise no more
[1511.76 - 1517.94] Cindy lamence says my natural path had
[1515.90 - 1520.40] me eating three eggs a day and on the
[1517.94 - 1521.60] keto diet then I got really sick and
[1520.40 - 1522.98] thankfully found medical medium
[1521.60 - 1524.06] information that's what I'm trying to
[1522.98 - 1526.34] say here
[1524.06 - 1528.44] all this seems like a great thing for
[1526.34 - 1530.66] the not so sick and a lot of them bounce
[1528.44 - 1532.76] back but when you get too sick this is
[1530.66 - 1535.22] not a great thing
[1532.76 - 1538.70] Sandra Sheehan says medical meaning
[1535.22 - 1541.34] protocols have decreased my 25 years of

[1627.26 - 1632.78] verbalists you have to understand that
[1630.38 - 1634.76] total respect for all doctors looking
[1632.78 - 1636.14] out for their patients they care about
[1634.76 - 1638.00] their patients they have compassion for
[1636.14 - 1640.22] their patients
[1638.00 - 1641.96] so I need that up front and we have a
[1640.22 - 1644.08] lot of practitioners in Med in medical
[1641.96 - 1648.46] meeting communities we have a lot of
[1644.08 - 1648.46] practitioners and doctors and so forth
[1652.64 - 1658.40] lupus free with celery33 I was just sent
[1655.76 - 1661.40] an article that vegans have a higher
[1658.40 - 1663.92] rate of Strokes I laughed and said not
[1661.40 - 1666.02] all vegans only those that eat all fat
[1663.92 - 1668.54] or high fat diets they never know the
[1666.02 - 1669.92] cause yet caution you lupus free seller
[1668.54 - 1673.64] you're spot on
[1669.92 - 1675.14] it's not just Strokes vegans
[1673.64 - 1678.50] get sick
[1675.14 - 1680.42] and the fats are just one problem
[1678.50 - 1681.86] and like you said the other problem is
[1680.42 - 1683.84] they don't know why they're even sick to
[1681.86 - 1685.40] begin with that's another problem and
[1683.84 - 1687.26] they have so many more problems right
[1685.40 - 1688.82] and medical medium information talks
[1687.26 - 1690.98] about
[1688.82 - 1693.80] and I'm pro-vegan
[1690.98 - 1695.48] provegan Pro plant-based
[1693.80 - 1697.58] times 10.
[1695.48 - 1699.50] and I'm also supportive for anybody that
[1697.58 - 1701.72] wants to eat animal protein too
[1699.50 - 1703.16] because they do it wrong too it's not
[1701.72 - 1706.48] just the vegans that do it wrong the
[1703.16 - 1706.48] animal protein people do it wrong
[1707.24 - 1712.82] and I wouldn't know what anybody did
[1710.72 - 1714.92] wrong I would be
[1712.82 - 1717.92] in the mix of all the health world
[1714.92 - 1720.20] that's where I chose my path to be
[1717.92 - 1722.06] and I would never know what anybody was
[1720.20 - 1723.56] doing wrong I'd be like everybody else
[1722.06 - 1725.54] just pissing in the wind and throwing
[1723.56 - 1728.36] darts at the side of a barn
[1725.54 - 1731.18] but it's because of soc do I know and
[1728.36 - 1734.38] it's because these incredible books
[1731.18 - 1734.38] do I know right
[1734.60 - 1740.62] other than that I wouldn't know what
[1737.60 - 1740.62] direction to piss in
[1740.66 - 1744.52] um
[1741.68 - 1744.52] in the Wind

[1838.82 - 1841.30] okay
[1841.52 - 1845.98] forgive me I am going back to the
[1843.62 - 1845.98] reading
[1847.34 - 1851.12] when you're hearing any of this for the
[1849.26 - 1852.80] first time and you're not so sick you
[1851.12 - 1854.72] can feel that satisfaction I talked
[1852.80 - 1857.36] about you're strong
[1854.72 - 1859.70] and now you become a health expert how
[1857.36 - 1860.90] many times have I seen it and it's not
[1859.70 - 1862.88] just young people but you'll see people
[1860.90 - 1865.40] they're like 25 years old or 20 years
[1862.88 - 1867.20] old or whatever right they have a not so
[1865.40 - 1869.24] sick problem they have some acting
[1867.20 - 1872.18] that's really Mild they get a little bit
[1869.24 - 1874.16] of brain fog they go to a naturopath or
[1872.18 - 1876.44] a functional medicine doctor they get
[1874.16 - 1878.36] taught a few tricks they get off of
[1876.44 - 1880.10] processed foods now they're on their
[1878.36 - 1881.66] page and they're teaching about it right
[1880.10 - 1883.94] and they're talking about it now they're
[1881.66 - 1886.10] a health influencer but they don't know
[1883.94 - 1887.84] the difference they don't know that
[1886.10 - 1889.58] somebody might not be a not so sick
[1887.84 - 1891.68] person somebody might be a very very
[1889.58 - 1893.54] sick person and they're listening to the
[1891.68 - 1895.46] not so sick person and the sick person
[1893.54 - 1897.68] doesn't really know that the not so sick
[1895.46 - 1900.14] person never really got sick
[1897.68 - 1902.12] so they don't know so like oh krill oil
[1900.14 - 1905.36] that's great oh sodium bicarbonate oh
[1902.12 - 1906.92] that's great oh whatever vitamin D and a
[1905.36 - 1908.66] really high dosage oh that's great and
[1906.92 - 1910.88] they just don't know
[1908.66 - 1912.50] and so the confusion happens right there
[1910.88 - 1914.30] right it's almost like and I'm just
[1912.50 - 1916.04] naming a few things just off the top of
[1914.30 - 1917.96] my head
[1916.04 - 1919.82] but the point is is the not so sick
[1917.96 - 1921.92] person is now an expert
[1919.82 - 1923.96] because they got rid of their mild not
[1921.92 - 1925.40] so sick symptom and they're really
[1923.96 - 1928.10] strong and their scale hasn't been
[1925.40 - 1930.26] tipped yet and they're young but now
[1928.10 - 1933.98] they're an expert so now they're not
[1930.26 - 1936.56] only doing say fashion or sports or
[1933.98 - 1938.12] something on their IG page or IG account
[1936.56 - 1939.68] now they're doing health and they're
[1938.12 - 1941.12] doing like what I eat in a day and
[1939.68 - 1943.46] everything else
[1941.12 - 1945.62] because they become they think they
[1943.46 - 1947.12] become an expert they were not so sick
[1945.62 - 1949.76] to begin with and they think they become
[1947.12 - 1952.04] an expert so now they're teaching
[1949.76 - 1953.24] as if they're experts and there's a
[1952.04 - 1954.50] million of them out there right there's
[1953.24 - 1956.66] a billion of them out there that's how
[1954.50 - 1958.48] it's done now
[1956.66 - 1960.80] by the way we're live right now at
[1958.48 - 1962.18] medicalmedium.com you can watch it

[1970.46 - 1975.86] people today do believe they are experts
[1973.52 - 1977.30] on anything they've experienced with
[1975.86 - 1979.78] their health
[1977.30 - 1983.86] if a not so sick person
[1979.78 - 1983.86] experienced a symptom or two
[1984.02 - 1989.96] they believe they're experts now
[1987.98 - 1993.08] they had an acute problem or condition
[1989.96 - 1995.48] or intermittent symptom that was
[1993.08 - 1997.94] perplexing them they got some help
[1995.48 - 2000.88] learned what it feels like
[1997.94 - 2004.12] Cutting Edge information
[2000.88 - 2007.12] seemed to overcome it or Managed IT and
[2004.12 - 2009.64] now suddenly they're Health experts

[2015.16 - 2021.52] far more sick

[2021.52 - 2026.74] when you're not so sick you can play in
[2023.92 - 2028.48] the world of reading new theories or
[2026.74 - 2031.92] trying new supplements in alternative

[2298.60 - 2304.42] and so has so many people
[2302.14 - 2305.86] so has so many people
[2304.42 - 2307.90] from what I'm hearing from Doctor
[2305.86 - 2310.60] friends from what I'm hearing from
[2307.90 - 2312.28] people and family and and other people
[2310.60 - 2314.80] out there families friends and stuff
[2312.28 - 2317.62] like that yeah
[2314.80 - 2319.54] but it's not just propolis the thing is
[2317.62 - 2321.22] is people can't get this confused though
[2319.54 - 2323.38] if you don't know what we're even
[2321.22 - 2325.12] talking about if this is kind of like I
[2323.38 - 2326.44] feel like this is an inside thing right
[2325.12 - 2327.70] if you don't know what we're talking
[2326.44 - 2328.90] about and you just got here and you
[2327.70 - 2331.24] don't even know what we're saying this
[2328.90 - 2333.76] is the beverage propolis cure so no
[2331.24 - 2336.94] one's confused because propolis won't do
[2333.76 - 2338.50] that they're not the same
[2336.94 - 2341.80] um but that's the propolis pure from
[2338.50 - 2344.26] emoji so anyway the V is in Victor i m e
[2341.80 - 2346.42] r g y you guys know I endorse these guys
[2344.26 - 2349.02] wholeheartedly
[2346.42 - 2349.02] yeah
[2349.06 - 2353.80] make a wholeheartedly
[2352.06 - 2356.08] deservingly so
[2353.80 - 2358.62] deserving Lisa
[2356.08 - 2358.62] all right
[2360.70 - 2365.14] little does someone who's a not so sick
[2363.82 - 2367.02] person
[2365.14 - 2369.04] who thinks they're a health expert
[2367.02 - 2370.84] realized that the theories and
[2369.04 - 2373.66] supplements and old techniques are the
[2370.84 - 2376.72] ones the sick have already tried
[2373.66 - 2379.00] trendy products trendy machines the sick
[2376.72 - 2382.24] have tried them all and they've only
[2379.00 - 2384.10] gone downhill they have experience of
[2382.24 - 2385.72] charcoal bringing them down and not
[2384.10 - 2387.64] realizing they have the experience of
[2385.72 - 2388.84] things bringing them down and not
[2387.64 - 2391.24] realizing they've tried everything
[2388.84 - 2393.94] meanwhile The Not So Sick can play in
[2391.24 - 2396.58] these trendy places they can play in
[2393.94 - 2399.64] this they can play Reindeer Games The
[2396.58 - 2404.44] Not So Sick they're not sick enough yet
[2399.64 - 2407.44] there's their scale hasn't tipped
[2404.44 - 2409.84] and even they can even revive old
[2407.44 - 2412.00] techniques and theories for other not so
[2409.84 - 2413.80] sick people to play in they can do that
[2412.00 - 2415.54] too and they're not so sick actually
[2413.80 - 2417.06] revive
[2415.54 - 2420.52] old
[2417.06 - 2421.90] tools products and theories that were
[2420.52 - 2424.18] bad
[2421.90 - 2425.98] but the not so sick can revive those
[2424.18 - 2429.90] because they're not sick enough yet to
[2425.98 - 2429.90] realize those are really bad
[2429.94 - 2434.74] and they do it for the other not so sick
[2432.40 - 2437.32] people to play in oh I tried this I
[2434.74 - 2441.78] tried that I tried bentonite clay
[2437.32 - 2441.78] um I tried this right in the whole bit
[2441.94 - 2445.72] they end up making them popular again so
[2444.64 - 2448.12] it's like
[2445.72 - 2450.94] hell comes back to haunt
[2448.12 - 2453.24] people Michelle L says I needed this
[2450.94 - 2453.24] today
[2456.48 - 2462.82] so meanwhile the not so sick influencers
[2460.18 - 2466.30] or the not so sick people out there that
[2462.82 - 2468.34] think they're Health experts revive
[2466.30 - 2470.08] things that should have been put to
[2468.34 - 2471.88] sleep a long time ago
[2470.08 - 2474.82] and they revive them through social
[2471.88 - 2477.10] media and other media sources for the
[2474.82 - 2479.02] other not so sick people to play with
[2477.10 - 2481.96] but what happens is the really sick
[2479.02 - 2485.88] people who haven't tried that yet end up
[2481.96 - 2485.88] trying it and go down even further
[2486.46 - 2492.34] The Not So Sick don't realize that as
[2490.12 - 2494.32] they get sicker down the road because
[2492.34 - 2496.12] their health scale has finally ticked
[2494.32 - 2498.10] and that's what happens there's a whole
[2496.12 - 2500.38] bunch of not so sick people out there
[2498.10 - 2502.42] right now
[2500.38 - 2503.74] and down the road their scale is going
[2502.42 - 2506.50] to tip
[2503.74 - 2509.56] there's millions of not so sick people
[2506.50 - 2512.82] right now millions and their scale is
[2509.56 - 2512.82] going to eventually tip
[2512.86 - 2517.24] the approaches they were trying for
[2514.90 - 2519.34] their health will show themselves not to
[2517.24 - 2522.10] be useful
[2519.34 - 2524.68] the recommended diets from their health
[2522.10 - 2526.12] care providers direct amended tools and
[2524.68 - 2527.98] techniques and supplements from their
[2526.12 - 2530.68] health care providers all of it will
[2527.98 - 2532.30] prove not as helpful as they as the
[2530.68 - 2534.46] scale tips and they get sicker and
[2532.30 - 2536.38] sicker and sicker
[2534.46 - 2537.88] I mean I believe in doctors of course I
[2536.38 - 2540.46] support doctors do what's right for you
[2537.88 - 2542.68] and go to your doctor and and do what
[2540.46 - 2544.96] your doctor tells you what they were
[2542.68 - 2546.88] invested in or guiding others should do
[2544.96 - 2548.38] was not ultimately helpful do you see
[2546.88 - 2549.82] that now you know I've seen this with
[2548.38 - 2553.48] YouTube I've had people tell me about
[2549.82 - 2556.12] people's YouTubes right out there
[2553.48 - 2558.16] where two years ago they're like
[2556.12 - 2560.20] promoting all this stuff right they're
[2558.16 - 2562.12] not so sick they're like oh here I'm a
[2560.20 - 2564.58] health expert on YouTube and they're
[2562.12 - 2566.02] promoting stuff and then they're not
[2564.58 - 2569.20] promoting it anymore and they're not
[2566.02 - 2570.88] eating that way anymore what happened it
[2569.20 - 2572.44] wasn't working for them so now they're
[2570.88 - 2573.52] trying something else they're not so
[2572.44 - 2575.44] sick and they're trying something else
[2573.52 - 2577.60] like it's this crazy thing
[2575.44 - 2579.58] nothing's consistent
[2577.60 - 2582.10] over here in Rumble since I've been
[2579.58 - 2584.02] listening and reading books I began to
[2582.10 - 2586.78] understand my body's soul and spirit
[2584.02 - 2589.36] thank you for reading the magazine books
[2586.78 - 2593.26] incredible
[2589.36 - 2595.54] here's one on Rumble back in 1999 just
[2593.26 - 2596.80] you you hate when comments go up and up
[2595.54 - 2600.06] and up and then you can't catch them
[2596.80 - 2600.06] let's see if I can catch a new one
[2601.00 - 2603.78] they go up
[2604.54 - 2608.92] see if I can catch this one oh my gosh
[2606.10 - 2611.50] that's the truth explanation points when
[2608.92 - 2613.36] I couldn't exercise that was when it was
[2611.50 - 2615.76] a steady down
[2613.36 - 2617.80] The Not So Sick and exercise The Not So
[2615.76 - 2619.72] Sick can go into the gym and they could
[2617.80 - 2621.22] Groove and move not so sick because
[2619.72 - 2623.32] they're not sick really
[2621.22 - 2625.00] they can exercise their scale hasn't
[2623.32 - 2626.14] tipped they don't know what it's like to
[2625.00 - 2629.94] be on mattress Island they don't know
[2626.14 - 2629.94] what it's like to be whoa cut short
[2630.04 - 2635.08] if you're on YouTube right now or Rumble
[2632.86 - 2637.48] can you give this video a thumbs up or
[2635.08 - 2641.10] whatever like a thumbs up or rumble or
[2637.48 - 2641.10] whatever that would be amazing
[2645.52 - 2649.72] before that day comes when their health
[2647.56 - 2651.22] worsens the not so sick person when the
[2649.72 - 2653.56] scale is tipped
[2651.22 - 2655.78] before that day comes it doesn't take
[2653.56 - 2658.60] much for a not so sick person to feel a
[2655.78 - 2661.84] benefit from a health technique
[2658.60 - 2663.10] when someone's not so sick they can feel
[2661.84 - 2665.32] a benefit
[2663.10 - 2667.86] from practically any toxic Health
[2665.32 - 2667.86] technique
[2667.90 - 2670.78] is that crazy
[2669.34 - 2672.82] when they're not so sick because their
[2670.78 - 2674.14] body is overcompensating it constantly
[2672.82 - 2676.60] because they're really not that sick
[2674.14 - 2678.16] their bodies over compensating it so
[2676.60 - 2680.20] they overcompensate that Health
[2678.16 - 2683.28] technique even if it's toxic even if
[2680.20 - 2683.28] it's problematic
[2683.50 - 2687.10] Michelle says or they lie about using
[2685.54 - 2690.76] medical meaning while misleading others
[2687.10 - 2693.94] actually that we have tremendous amount
[2690.76 - 2696.88] of proof that that happens Non-Stop
[2693.94 - 2698.62] that people are using mm
[2696.88 - 2700.00] all the supermodels are doing celery
[2698.62 - 2701.98] juice
[2700.00 - 2704.14] they're not talking about it look
[2701.98 - 2706.00] everybody's like the amount of medical
[2704.14 - 2708.72] meaning being used where do you think
[2706.00 - 2711.10] the zinc thing blew up how zinc blew up
[2708.72 - 2713.02] both in the conventional world now of
[2711.10 - 2715.68] Health like it's like it's it's
[2713.02 - 2715.68] unbelievable
[2716.80 - 2721.54] Karen Karen Hartman said oh my God it's
[2719.14 - 2724.42] like you're talking about me I did the
[2721.54 - 2725.98] charcoal bentonite clay humic and now
[2724.42 - 2727.90] feeling like I am at a Tipping Point
[2725.98 - 2733.50] thank you for your information and what
[2727.90 - 2733.50] you do Karen completely understand I do
[2733.84 - 2738.46] before that day comes for the not so
[2735.88 - 2740.02] sick person when their health worsens it
[2738.46 - 2743.92] doesn't take much for a not so sick
[2740.02 - 2745.78] person to feel a benefit from a health
[2743.92 - 2747.66] technique that's toxic
[2745.78 - 2750.00] many of these people are only
[2747.66 - 2752.86] intermittently sick they're only
[2750.00 - 2755.86] intermittently sick with a mild symptom
[2752.86 - 2758.50] that comes and goes on its own
[2755.86 - 2760.06] no one realizes they are just an
[2758.50 - 2763.44] experiment for the Alternative Health
[2760.06 - 2763.44] world too at the same time
[2763.78 - 2767.86] so dealing with a mild symptom that
[2765.82 - 2770.74] comes and goes on its own seeming to get
[2767.86 - 2772.36] better with a little bit of sleep
[2770.74 - 2773.80] you know
[2772.36 - 2776.92] you know what
[2773.80 - 2779.14] a sick person knows do you know what a
[2776.92 - 2780.64] sick person knows that's been there and
[2779.14 - 2783.52] tried everything
[2780.64 - 2785.58] they know
[2783.52 - 2787.42] that if they get a little bit of sleep
[2785.58 - 2789.10] it doesn't mean they're going to be
[2787.42 - 2791.14] fixed the next day
[2789.10 - 2793.56] well you know nons not so sick people
[2791.14 - 2795.94] all not so sick people have to do
[2793.56 - 2798.10] depending on what degree of not so sick
[2795.94 - 2800.20] they just need to get sleep for a couple
[2798.10 - 2801.52] days
[2800.20 - 2803.44] that's all
[2801.52 - 2806.94] but the scale tips eventually and then
[2803.44 - 2806.94] they're not they're not in that position
[2807.82 - 2812.68] The Not So Sick seemingly get better
[2810.16 - 2814.80] with a little bit of sleep a new vitamin
[2812.68 - 2818.22] protocol cleaning up their Foods
[2814.80 - 2821.02] intermittent fasting lymphatic massage
[2818.22 - 2823.26] sauna routines I'll keep on going in a
[2821.02 - 2828.40] second here octo
[2823.26 - 2830.50] octop Corp I love the pages
[2828.40 - 2832.66] that are in the newsletter
[2830.50 - 2834.76] the brain shot therapy challenge emails
[2832.66 - 2836.98] you signed up for have the page numbers
[2834.76 - 2839.14] we are covering for the day so you're
[2836.98 - 2840.96] seeing how we're you're seeing the work
[2839.14 - 2843.22] of my team
[2840.96 - 2846.30] you're seeing the hard work the medical
[2843.22 - 2846.30] medium team does
[2847.30 - 2853.56] it's pretty cool I'll let them know
[2849.94 - 2853.56] you have to sign up to get them though
[2854.20 - 2858.58] all right this part's really important I
[2856.84 - 2860.86] have to I have to read this part to you
[2858.58 - 2863.46] this part's really important
[2860.86 - 2863.46] foreign
[2864.12 - 2868.36] people are only intermittently sick with
[2866.68 - 2870.58] a mild symptom that comes and goes on
[2868.36 - 2872.20] its own seeming to get better with a
[2870.58 - 2873.70] little bit of sleep a new vitamin
[2872.20 - 2875.74] protocol cleaning up their Foods

[2878.32 - 2882.66] breathing class or workout class
[2883.30 - 2887.26] they think they have the Panacea they're
[2885.70 - 2888.88] not so sick
[2887.26 - 2890.68] that's all they needed to kind of like
[2888.88 - 2892.78] ebb and flow with their symptoms they're
[2890.68 - 2895.36] not so sick
[2892.78 - 2898.18] the land of Alternative Health games is
[2895.36 - 2900.94] filled with many trendy options
[2898.18 - 2904.92] The Not So Sick have the freedom to play
[2900.94 - 2908.92] in this fairy tale land waffle about
[2904.92 - 2911.92] latch onto something of interest to tell
[2908.92 - 2913.90] others about and remain disconnected
[2911.92 - 2916.56] from the difference between being a not
[2913.90 - 2916.56] so sick person
[2917.38 - 2920.58] and being so sick
[2921.58 - 2927.88] that last part is really incredible
[2924.94 - 2932.16] and remain disconnected from the
[2927.88 - 2932.16] difference between sick and not so sick
[2932.32 - 2935.92] since the not so sick who's waffling
[2934.06 - 2938.02] about in a little bit of Breath class
[2935.92 - 2941.08] and a little bit of workout class and a
[2938.02 - 2942.82] little bit of yoga class and try in a
[2941.08 - 2944.08] little bit of intermittent fasting and a
[2942.82 - 2946.00] little bit of this and a little bit of
[2944.08 - 2948.04] that that person
[2946.00 - 2951.28] that not so sick person is completely
[2948.04 - 2952.72] disconnected between the difference of
[2951.28 - 2954.64] being a not so sick person like
[2952.72 - 2956.26] themselves or someone who's been through
[2954.64 - 2957.88] it all and they're really sick and
[2956.26 - 2960.58] they're chronically ill now the medical
[2957.88 - 2962.26] me in community is for The Chronic Leo
[2960.58 - 2964.42] and yes it's for a not so sick person
[2962.26 - 2967.06] and yes it's for anybody who's feeling
[2964.42 - 2969.22] good and wants to come and partake in it
[2967.06 - 2971.14] but it's for the people who've been
[2969.22 - 2973.48] through hell and back it's real answers
[2971.14 - 2976.38] for the people to to have a chance to
[2973.48 - 2976.38] rise out of it
[2978.52 - 2983.38] being sick
[2981.52 - 2987.22] sick
[2983.38 - 2990.12] is an entirely different space
[2987.22 - 2992.44] the sick have left the realm of play
[2990.12 - 2996.40] correct me if I'm wrong if I'm wrong
[2992.44 - 2998.58] tell me if I'm wrong then then my bad my
[2996.40 - 2998.58] bad
[2999.76 - 3004.98] the sick have left the realm of play
[3003.06 - 3006.90] you get too sick
[3004.98 - 3009.48] you leave the realm of play
[3006.90 - 3011.34] the sick are seasoned
[3009.48 - 3014.06] the sick have already done the
[3011.34 - 3014.06] probiotics
[3014.82 - 3021.12] the fish oils the whey protein powder
[3017.88 - 3024.60] and other protein powders the charcoal
[3021.12 - 3027.24] the oil pulling the neem oil the
[3024.60 - 3029.46] L-Carnitine the chlorella the
[3027.24 - 3032.10] diatomaceous earth particles the sodium
[3029.46 - 3034.62] bicarbonate the gut powders the
[3032.10 - 3038.10] Bentonite Clay and other Clays the
[3034.62 - 3041.52] zeolite the fulvic acid the humic acid
[3038.10 - 3044.76] right the deer antler the colostrum the
[3041.52 - 3048.18] collagen the protein bars the MCT oil
[3044.76 - 3050.84] the Kombucha Tea the chocolate the green
[3048.18 - 3053.58] tea the apple cider vinegar the
[3050.84 - 3056.10] chlorophyll the alkaline ionizer water
[3053.58 - 3059.22] machines and dozens more the sick have
[3056.10 - 3060.98] become seasoned too from visiting dozens
[3059.22 - 3065.18] of doctors and trying everything
[3060.98 - 3065.18] including fecal transplants
[3066.78 - 3071.40] I'm not telling you that you shouldn't
[3068.94 - 3072.72] do what your doctor wants you to do if
[3071.40 - 3074.22] your doctor wants you to do a fecal
[3072.72 - 3075.66] implant and that's what you're doing I'm
[3074.22 - 3080.12] not telling you different but I would
[3075.66 - 3080.12] never do it in a million freaking years
[3081.54 - 3086.34] I would never do it you think they can
[3084.36 - 3087.72] actually figure out what viruses are in
[3086.34 - 3089.16] somebody else's fecal they're not even
[3087.72 - 3090.66] looking for those viruses they don't
[3089.16 - 3092.04] even know what they look like
[3090.66 - 3094.02] and they're going to implant it in
[3092.04 - 3097.62] somebody else
[3094.02 - 3100.74] it's absurd it's insane
[3097.62 - 3103.32] Saint Sue says so wait I'm confused
[3100.74 - 3105.60] again how does this ego shot relate to
[3103.32 - 3107.28] the info with the not so six sorry my
[3105.60 - 3109.38] brain and neurons are not firing your
[3107.28 - 3111.60] brain and neurons firing because it's
[3109.38 - 3113.88] about also dealing with it all it's easy
[3111.60 - 3116.72] to get pushed off your healing path with
[3113.88 - 3116.72] all the misinformation
[3117.90 - 3122.76] and you can get thrown off track by
[3120.36 - 3125.76] other people's egos because the not so
[3122.76 - 3127.62] sick tend to have some raging egos out
[3125.76 - 3129.42] there they think they found it all they
[3127.62 - 3131.58] think they know it all they think that
[3129.42 - 3134.46] their little keto diet and their breath
[3131.58 - 3136.20] class is why they're not sick they're
[3134.46 - 3138.54] not sick from other reasons they're just
[3136.20 - 3140.52] not sick yet their skill hasn't tipped
[3138.54 - 3142.68] it's to keep you unpa it's to keep you
[3140.52 - 3144.24] on path of the information because
[3142.68 - 3146.16] because if there's so much
[3144.24 - 3149.18] misinformation out there propelled by
[3146.16 - 3151.74] the ego based communities in health
[3149.18 - 3155.10] Alternative Health is one big huge ego
[3151.74 - 3157.20] out there it's a massive ego proportion
[3155.10 - 3158.94] people don't even realize this is to
[3157.20 - 3162.54] help you stay true to yourself and keep
[3158.94 - 3165.66] you on track you can also
[3162.54 - 3167.34] um you can also give the the ego shot to
[3165.66 - 3171.32] your friends and so forth
[3167.34 - 3171.32] but it's really fun anyway
[3171.36 - 3175.28] if that made sense at the end all right
[3176.04 - 3180.60] the sick have become season two from
[3178.56 - 3185.36] visiting dozens of doctors and trying
[3180.60 - 3185.36] everything including fecal transplants
[3188.16 - 3191.82] what a stupid experiment that is but if
[3190.80 - 3193.32] your doctor tells you do what your
[3191.82 - 3195.06] doctor tells you I'm just saying but I
[3193.32 - 3197.34] would never do it
[3195.06 - 3201.54] bee sting therapy
[3197.34 - 3204.36] would a disaster bee sting therapy is
[3201.54 - 3205.86] I mean I know why
[3204.36 - 3207.30] I mean I'm not going to explain it all
[3205.86 - 3208.92] in this moment
[3207.30 - 3211.44] but yeah
[3208.92 - 3213.42] all the all the the bee sting therapy is
[3211.44 - 3214.80] is used is self-medicating with your own
[3213.42 - 3216.60] adrenaline because your body's in a
[3214.80 - 3219.78] cytokine storm because you've got a bee
[3216.60 - 3224.34] sting it's really a bad therapy
[3219.78 - 3229.34] urine therapy another one that's absurd
[3224.34 - 3229.34] urine therapy is absolutely ridic
[3229.38 - 3232.22] it's ridiculous
[3235.38 - 3239.64] coffee enemas dangerous
[3240.96 - 3245.76] I'm working on a coffee
[3243.72 - 3249.92] enema
[3245.76 - 3249.92] podcast and I couldn't get it done
[3250.20 - 3254.22] I've been working on trying to finish a
[3252.06 - 3257.58] coffee animal podcast a while ago and I
[3254.22 - 3261.60] never got it finished but anyway
[3257.58 - 3265.92] Rife machines stem cell therapy UV blood
[3261.60 - 3269.46] irrigation radiation ozone
[3265.92 - 3272.04] cold therapy and more the seasoned sick
[3269.46 - 3274.32] have been there and done that if you're
[3272.04 - 3276.24] not so sick you can play around in OZO
[3274.32 - 3277.62] land you can play around in cold therapy
[3276.24 - 3280.98] if you're not so sick you can play
[3277.62 - 3282.78] around with UV blood right
[3280.98 - 3284.46] a radiation you can play around with
[3282.78 - 3286.14] fecal transplants you can play around
[3284.46 - 3288.36] bee sting therapy if you're not so sick
[3286.14 - 3291.00] you can play around with anything you
[3288.36 - 3293.16] can play play play bentonite clay and
[3291.00 - 3295.68] everything else and charcoal and all
[3293.16 - 3297.18] these combined plus ionizer water
[3295.68 - 3300.30] machines and anything else that comes
[3297.18 - 3302.40] your way you can play in it on IG
[3300.30 - 3306.98] create happiness says my mom used coffee
[3302.40 - 3306.98] enemas and she died soon oh God
[3308.82 - 3314.96] bless your heart and just know that my
[3311.70 - 3314.96] heart pours out to you
[3320.76 - 3326.34] the not so sick
[3323.82 - 3328.64] when they get their first symptoms May
[3326.34 - 3331.32] believe the health world is their oyster
[3328.64 - 3332.82] as they stumble across remedy after
[3331.32 - 3335.76] remedy
[3332.82 - 3338.22] I'm not so sick
[3335.76 - 3340.56] oh my God charcoal it says it does
[3338.22 - 3342.72] everything for you activate trouble fish
[3340.56 - 3346.20] oil is what I need for my brain
[3342.72 - 3348.62] it's a Panacea out here human can folic
[3346.20 - 3348.62] acid
[3349.38 - 3353.34] or would a doctor friend of mine call
[3351.24 - 3355.32] shlat
[3353.34 - 3356.76] then he's from India and he calls it
[3355.32 - 3358.80] shalat
[3356.76 - 3361.26] anyway shillajit
[3358.80 - 3362.28] right so you said what page am I reading
[3361.26 - 3365.70] from
[3362.28 - 3368.40] page 578 brain saver
[3365.70 - 3371.96] Sonia says um what page are you reading
[3368.40 - 3371.96] from oh my God information
[3372.06 - 3376.26] Terry Appleman says I have no idea
[3374.28 - 3378.54] people didn't really know anything about
[3376.26 - 3382.28] why I was sick until everything let me
[3378.54 - 3382.28] down and I ended up sicker than ever
[3382.98 - 3386.06] bless your heart
[3388.02 - 3392.10] so it feels like you just it feels like
[3390.36 - 3395.70] you just
[3392.10 - 3397.38] landed in a tropical Paradise when you
[3395.70 - 3399.84] first when you first get a sim number
[3397.38 - 3402.06] two and you see there's a Panacea of
[3399.84 - 3403.74] alternative therapies everywhere and
[3402.06 - 3405.66] they all seem to make so much sense
[3403.74 - 3408.30] because the people talking about the
[3405.66 - 3410.22] alternative therapies are so smart and
[3408.30 - 3412.50] it seems so smart
[3410.22 - 3414.48] even though it doesn't if you really
[3412.50 - 3415.92] crack it a coffee enema is the worst
[3414.48 - 3417.84] thing that you can do to your adrenals
[3415.92 - 3420.92] in your liver but nobody does it's like
[3417.84 - 3420.92] it's crazy right
[3421.02 - 3424.86] did not so sick people when they get
[3423.24 - 3426.66] their first symptoms May believe the
[3424.86 - 3428.88] health world is their oyster as they
[3426.66 - 3430.80] stumble across remedy after remedy with
[3428.88 - 3432.60] confident practitioners who haven't gone
[3430.80 - 3434.88] through a major Health crisis themselves
[3432.60 - 3436.74] and that's another problem
[3434.88 - 3441.14] if I ever get sick
[3436.74 - 3441.14] if I ever get sick
[3443.22 - 3448.52] and I need the help of a health care
[3445.92 - 3448.52] provider
[3449.34 - 3452.28] I want to make sure that healthcare
[3451.02 - 3454.98] provider
[3452.28 - 3456.84] was really sick
[3454.98 - 3458.46] really sick
[3456.84 - 3460.50] hands and knees
[3458.46 - 3462.90] praying to God
[3460.50 - 3465.18] not knowing what the hell's up or down
[3462.90 - 3467.88] been through hell and back
[3465.18 - 3469.14] burned to the ground rose out of the
[3467.88 - 3471.48] ashes
[3469.14 - 3473.70] and was back practicing
[3471.48 - 3476.40] that's the healthcare provider that I
[3473.70 - 3479.16] would want me personally
[3476.40 - 3480.66] I mean but I'm not saying keep your
[3479.16 - 3482.34] health care providers don't look for
[3480.66 - 3484.94] that if you got a good one I'm just
[3482.34 - 3488.04] saying that's what I would want
[3484.94 - 3490.44] the search for a way to heal starts at
[3488.04 - 3492.54] the most basic tier the sicker you get
[3490.44 - 3494.46] the more you've sifted through what's
[3492.54 - 3497.52] offered out there
[3494.46 - 3500.70] there's tears the sicker you get the
[3497.52 - 3502.74] more the right the more you sift it
[3500.70 - 3505.14] through the sicker you get the more you
[3502.74 - 3506.58] sift it through the not so sick many
[3505.14 - 3509.16] times the not so sick we're talking
[3506.58 - 3512.42] about now think it's impossible for them
[3509.16 - 3514.80] to ever get sick with a chronic illness
[3512.42 - 3518.48] I can't tell you how many times I've
[3514.80 - 3518.48] seen that the not so sick
[3518.82 - 3523.92] thinking it's impossible for them to get
[3521.46 - 3526.08] any sicker to get sick with a chronic
[3523.92 - 3527.76] illness they will never believe they can
[3526.08 - 3529.74] get sick with a chronic illness and not
[3527.76 - 3532.02] so sick
[3529.74 - 3534.24] they don't want to think they could ever
[3532.02 - 3536.06] get there because that's frightening and
[3534.24 - 3538.26] their health approach must be the answer
[3536.06 - 3540.54] the health world is so full of
[3538.26 - 3542.94] misinformation I like this shot to keep
[3540.54 - 3544.86] us on the humble path keeping true to
[3542.94 - 3547.62] ourselves and able to access our soul
[3544.86 - 3549.24] and not the brainwashing we've received
[3547.62 - 3552.00] down here our subconscious and
[3549.24 - 3554.04] Consciousness can be brainwashed we want
[3552.00 - 3555.96] to access our soul knowledge the ego
[3554.04 - 3557.88] shift is really helpful in general for
[3555.96 - 3560.42] all this stuff not just this with this
[3557.88 - 3560.42] but just everything
[3564.90 - 3569.52] the not so sick people don't want to
[3567.54 - 3570.90] think that they could ever get sick
[3569.52 - 3572.76] because it's frightening and their
[3570.90 - 3574.62] health approach must be the answer of
[3572.76 - 3576.42] course they're still doing their
[3574.62 - 3579.12] workouts so it should be fine they're
[3576.42 - 3580.74] still able to work out
[3579.12 - 3583.68] they're still having their cheat days
[3580.74 - 3586.40] right the not so sick still want to have
[3583.68 - 3586.40] their cheat days
[3587.04 - 3591.60] and they want to be quick to call
[3588.72 - 3593.46] somebody orthorexic oh you're taking
[3591.60 - 3595.44] care of yourself too much oh you're
[3593.46 - 3598.92] orthorexic I noticed that the not so
[3595.44 - 3601.88] sick people that's a Telltale sign
[3598.92 - 3601.88] right there
[3601.92 - 3607.56] that if a not so sick person's claiming
[3605.28 - 3610.14] they're really sick
[3607.56 - 3611.64] or they've been really sick and now
[3610.14 - 3614.94] they're a coach a health coach or a
[3611.64 - 3617.16] practitioner or whatever if a if a this
[3614.94 - 3618.54] is proof If a person claims they were
[3617.16 - 3620.58] really sick with some kind of
[3618.54 - 3622.80] life-threatening disease they were
[3620.58 - 3626.22] really down in in the in the depths of
[3622.80 - 3628.44] hell and they crawl out of it they claim
[3626.22 - 3630.54] and then they say
[3628.44 - 3633.48] that if you're eating that way or this
[3630.54 - 3635.94] way you're orthorexic or that
[3633.48 - 3637.44] and men can make you orthorexic or that
[3635.94 - 3639.12] whatever then they were never really
[3637.44 - 3642.32] that sick it's it's
[3639.12 - 3642.32] shines a light
[3642.78 - 3645.74] because you know
[3646.86 - 3651.74] it shines the light because when you're
[3648.66 - 3651.74] really really sick
[3652.26 - 3656.22] you would never
[3654.06 - 3659.24] call anybody orthorexic when they're
[3656.22 - 3659.24] taking care of themselves
[3661.74 - 3666.18] and they notice throughout the years I
[3663.66 - 3667.92] see this all the time
[3666.18 - 3669.42] it's so strange
[3667.92 - 3671.40] see the minute you start taking care of
[3669.42 - 3673.50] yourself and eating better and all this
[3671.40 - 3675.84] stuff then someone pops up and says oh
[3673.50 - 3677.82] you have orthorexia or your orthorexic
[3675.84 - 3679.68] it's like are you kidding just because I
[3677.82 - 3682.64] want to live and I want to heal and I
[3679.68 - 3682.64] want to do the right things
[3684.42 - 3689.46] they have their cheat days they feel
[3686.52 - 3691.50] like they're keeping balanced practicing
[3689.46 - 3693.96] moderation intuitively living their
[3691.50 - 3696.36] lives they believe that person who's
[3693.96 - 3698.34] really sick that's not me that's not
[3696.36 - 3702.24] going to be me I'm never going to get
[3698.34 - 3704.40] sick I'm just gonna be where I am
[3702.24 - 3706.44] then when you come across then when you
[3704.40 - 3708.30] cross the threshold to being very sick
[3706.44 - 3710.88] Everything Changes
[3708.30 - 3713.16] it's a different world
[3710.88 - 3715.50] one of survival
[3713.16 - 3718.86] your goals are different from the goals
[3715.50 - 3720.06] of the Not So Sick Things change in your
[3718.86 - 3722.76] life
[3720.06 - 3724.44] even relationships can change it's a
[3722.76 - 3727.02] whole other world of understanding
[3724.44 - 3729.36] Health what I'm trying to say is
[3727.02 - 3730.50] if you pass the point of just being not
[3729.36 - 3732.72] so sick
[3730.50 - 3736.50] into the land of sick at some point in
[3732.72 - 3738.90] your life then you know things change
[3736.50 - 3742.68] your perspective the world changes
[3738.90 - 3746.40] you're humbled your ego gets kicked down
[3742.68 - 3748.92] that's why I'm talking about this too
[3746.40 - 3750.66] your ego gets kicked down someone asks
[3748.92 - 3753.60] what about chlorella make sure you grab
[3750.66 - 3755.70] the macrobium brain saber books and read
[3753.60 - 3759.62] about chlorella in the books to know
[3755.70 - 3759.62] what to be worried about with it
[3759.66 - 3766.38] all right guys
[3762.24 - 3766.38] I'm gonna pop along to
[3774.18 - 3777.84] I'm gonna pop along to this we're doing
[3775.80 - 3780.80] the ego shifter I want to read a little
[3777.84 - 3780.80] bit about that okay
[3783.60 - 3788.46] here we are
[3785.16 - 3789.60] it's a big book you can flip around in
[3788.46 - 3791.40] it forever
[3789.60 - 3793.58] anyway that's the ego shifter right
[3791.40 - 3793.58] there
[3793.62 - 3798.54] this shot is ideal and those moments
[3796.44 - 3800.46] when you feel like your ego has taken
[3798.54 - 3804.48] over your senses
[3800.46 - 3807.18] or your Common Sense and Sensibility
[3804.48 - 3808.98] there's a moment in all of our Lives
[3807.18 - 3811.44] when we
[3808.98 - 3813.78] can feel it's not just confidence we're
[3811.44 - 3815.64] working with but our ego is kind of
[3813.78 - 3818.82] taking over
[3815.64 - 3820.62] there's a sense that it's there in the
[3818.82 - 3822.66] background
[3820.62 - 3825.26] so there's ego and then there's
[3822.66 - 3825.26] confidence
[3825.30 - 3830.34] they're two different things
[3827.94 - 3832.62] and they can get mixed up
[3830.34 - 3835.38] someone can be really confident
[3832.62 - 3838.38] but their ego is
[3835.38 - 3840.24] kind of behind it all
[3838.38 - 3842.34] and that's a great time to take the ego
[3840.24 - 3846.24] shifter you want the confidence you want
[3842.34 - 3847.80] the ego to kind of chill and drop
[3846.24 - 3849.48] so you can take the shot when you feel
[3847.80 - 3851.22] like your ego has taken over your senses
[3849.48 - 3853.56] or your Common Sense and Sensibility
[3851.22 - 3855.66] take this shot if you feel like you're
[3853.56 - 3857.70] losing your true self
[3855.66 - 3859.32] losing sight of what's truly important
[3857.70 - 3861.78] so even if you don't think it's ego
[3859.32 - 3863.82] related on any level
[3861.78 - 3866.82] that's what's incredible about this ego
[3863.82 - 3868.44] shifter forget ego just move that aside
[3866.82 - 3870.06] for a second right
[3868.44 - 3872.22] taking this shot when you feel like
[3870.06 - 3874.92] you're losing your true self
[3872.22 - 3877.20] that's interesting because ego can play
[3874.92 - 3879.84] a role in pushing out your true self
[3877.20 - 3882.84] right the ego can actually
[3879.84 - 3884.70] push and Propel your true self out so
[3882.84 - 3886.62] that's a great time to do it
[3884.70 - 3890.90] take this shot if you feel like you may
[3886.62 - 3890.90] have been a little too self-absorbed
[3892.56 - 3896.40] you know when I think about
[3894.42 - 3898.50] self-absorbed
[3896.40 - 3899.94] oh like I don't see
[3898.50 - 3901.98] a huge part of the medical meme
[3899.94 - 3903.30] Community being self-absorbed not at all
[3901.98 - 3905.72] you guys are working on your healing
[3903.30 - 3909.06] process you're working hard
[3905.72 - 3911.10] self-absorbed is kind of another thing
[3909.06 - 3912.78] that a lot that people do out there they
[3911.10 - 3914.22] get really self-absorbed that's
[3912.78 - 3916.20] something that's a time to do the ego
[3914.22 - 3917.94] shifter
[3916.20 - 3919.98] you that's when you're kind of losing
[3917.94 - 3923.52] sight you're so self-absorbed you're
[3919.98 - 3925.56] losing sight of other people's pain and
[3923.52 - 3929.64] suffering you're losing sight of what's
[3925.56 - 3932.10] around you you know you lose that vision
[3929.64 - 3934.40] try this shot
[3932.10 - 3938.90] if you realize you've been completely
[3934.40 - 3938.90] self-consumed without caring for others
[3939.18 - 3942.30] even if you don't have the ability to
[3940.98 - 3943.80] care for others because you don't have
[3942.30 - 3945.72] that ability
[3943.80 - 3948.30] or strength
[3945.72 - 3950.22] if you just don't care at all that's a
[3948.30 - 3951.96] good time to take the ego shifter
[3950.22 - 3953.94] use this shot if you feel as if
[3951.96 - 3955.62] something inside of you is controlling
[3953.94 - 3960.20] your life
[3955.62 - 3962.82] and decisions while you watch from above
[3960.20 - 3965.04] whoa you know when Spirit of compassion
[3962.82 - 3967.82] put that in here
[3965.04 - 3967.82] it's like what
[3969.00 - 3973.80] I mean seriously I was blown off my seat
[3971.22 - 3977.36] you feel as if something inside of you
[3973.80 - 3977.36] is controlling your life
[3977.70 - 3981.18] and decisions
[3979.62 - 3983.16] something inside of you is controlling
[3981.18 - 3986.52] your decisions while you watch from
[3983.16 - 3988.44] above it's like no don't do that no
[3986.52 - 3990.60] don't do that oh my God what is
[3988.44 - 3992.58] happening why would I do that and you
[3990.60 - 3995.24] kind of watched it from above like why
[3992.58 - 3995.24] would I do that
[3995.64 - 4000.80] try this shot if you have a friend or
[3997.80 - 4003.02] loved one who has a very large ego do
[4000.80 - 4005.48] you guys know anybody who has a big ego
[4003.02 - 4008.06] besides
[4005.48 - 4009.92] besides aw just kidding
[4008.06 - 4012.80] do you do you have do you know anybody
[4009.92 - 4014.96] who has a very large ego
[4012.80 - 4016.88] and doesn't believe
[4014.96 - 4020.20] they do
[4016.88 - 4020.20] they don't believe they do
[4021.74 - 4025.30] everybody has an ego
[4029.00 - 4033.02] how about this one take this shot if you
[4030.92 - 4035.24] feel you need to take control of your
[4033.02 - 4037.46] life and override
[4035.24 - 4039.38] the drive to harm yourself
[4037.46 - 4042.26] so there's there's a lot of people out
[4039.38 - 4044.74] there that they have this drive to harm
[4042.26 - 4044.74] themselves
[4046.22 - 4050.54] toxic heavy metals play a role the ego
[4048.50 - 4053.08] shifter has something in it to shift and
[4050.54 - 4053.08] rewire
[4053.42 - 4057.86] try this ego shifter if you need to Free
[4056.36 - 4062.36] Yourself
[4057.86 - 4067.12] so your authentic Soul shines through
[4062.36 - 4067.12] and benefits you and the ones around you
[4067.16 - 4072.20] we also get brain let me just say this
[4069.68 - 4074.48] we also get brainwashed in harming
[4072.20 - 4076.04] ourselves too without even realizing it
[4074.48 - 4077.60] like that's another thing too
[4076.04 - 4080.18] conditioning
[4077.60 - 4083.86] so planet Earth
[4080.18 - 4087.56] has a way of conditioning people's minds
[4083.86 - 4089.42] brainwashing their minds
[4087.56 - 4093.02] so they harm themselves without even
[4089.42 - 4096.28] realizing it and they don't even realize
[4093.02 - 4096.28] that's what's happening
[4101.60 - 4105.58] anyway let's make the ego shifter
[4113.02 - 4116.38] Let's Roll
[4120.38 - 4125.90] got the Medicine maker here
[4123.86 - 4127.64] and let's crank it up but it got some
[4125.90 - 4129.58] comments I'd like to read real quick if
[4127.64 - 4133.10] we can
[4129.58 - 4136.10] eloya says I'm a silent Watcher but

[4137.60 - 4144.32] I am trying to declutter and heal my
[4141.02 - 4148.22] mind from an sad lifestyle
[4144.32 - 4150.26] lost spouse to chemo 13 years ago and
[4148.22 - 4152.30] since I started doing
[4150.26 - 4154.28] sorry and since I started going to
[4152.30 - 4156.20] doctors I'm worse
[4154.28 - 4159.56] well thank you for speaking up you're on
[4156.20 - 4161.12] YouTube Eloy Loya and um
[4159.56 - 4164.06] thank you for being here and thank you
[4161.12 - 4166.58] for speaking up seriously
[4164.06 - 4169.16] I know we have some silent Watchers out
[4166.58 - 4172.24] there and
[4169.16 - 4172.24] I'm honored
[4172.70 - 4177.68] Elvis lives thank goodness Anthony
[4174.62 - 4180.56] invented the term mattress Island just
[4177.68 - 4183.02] having that term at our disposal makes
[4180.56 - 4184.94] us feel we are not so nuts and also
[4183.02 - 4187.82] helps convey to others what we're going
[4184.94 - 4190.58] through and Elvis lives make no mistake
[4187.82 - 4191.72] mattress Island will be stolen and
[4190.58 - 4194.18] talked about in the other health
[4191.72 - 4197.14] communities while they never cite or
[4194.18 - 4200.06] mention mm
[4197.14 - 4202.46] so no one will be able to get all the
[4200.06 - 4203.84] information to get them off of mattress
[4202.46 - 4205.52] Island
[4203.84 - 4208.16] they'll know the term mattress Island
[4205.52 - 4210.38] but they won't have what it takes the
[4208.16 - 4212.00] information to get them off of mattress
[4210.38 - 4213.98] Island
[4212.00 - 4216.74] which is a very good point half time

[4310.52 - 4315.02] interesting
[4312.74 - 4317.06] um I don't think Dr Nesbitt Beatrice is

[4317.06 - 4320.96] think they're funny
[4318.38 - 4324.20] they were really looking for guidance
