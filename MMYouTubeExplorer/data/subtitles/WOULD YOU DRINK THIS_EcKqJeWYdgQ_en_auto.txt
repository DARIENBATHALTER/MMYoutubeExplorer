[395.28 - 400.40] facebook rumble
[397.36 - 402.56] we're even we're even live on twitch too
[400.40 - 406.00] so which is you know twitch we're live
[402.56 - 406.84] on that as well we're live on my website
[406.00 - 408.92] and
[406.84 - 410.96] medicalmedium.com we're live on
[408.92 - 412.64] medicalmedium.com which is utterly
[410.96 - 414.80] insane which is the coolest thing i've
[412.64 - 416.88] ever seen actually you guys we're live
[414.80 - 418.64] there so you can go to my website see
[416.88 - 420.80] when i when i'm live and i'm on there
[418.64 - 422.64] live now so anyway
[420.80 - 424.48] we're making some drinks i'm going to
[422.64 - 426.00] talk about wild blueberry
[424.48 - 427.20] we're going to talk about wild blueberry
[426.00 - 429.20] juice we're going to talk about the
[427.20 - 430.64] antioxidants we're going to talk about
[429.20 - 433.04] the power
[430.64 - 435.04] the antioxidants have chris stitch
[433.04 - 437.60] exactly is it twitch or it's twitch
[435.04 - 440.08] right it's twitch it's switch i like
[437.60 - 441.44] that one it's twitch all right
[440.08 - 443.84] so
[441.44 - 447.04] a lot of things to understand is as we
[443.84 - 450.64] age why do we age like as we're aging
[447.04 - 454.00] you can age good and you can age bad but
[450.64 - 456.24] we all age you can't stop from aging you
[454.00 - 458.80] can't shut aging down a hundred percent
[456.24 - 460.96] where it stops okay it doesn't work like
[458.80 - 464.08] that because
[460.96 - 466.88] all right as the earth is traveling
[464.08 - 470.08] around the sun
[466.88 - 473.04] it's impossible to stop the earth from
[470.08 - 474.64] traveling around the sun so you're going
[473.04 - 475.84] to age
[474.64 - 479.52] but
[475.84 - 481.12] there's a difference between aging badly
[479.52 - 484.72] or aging
[481.12 - 486.80] goodly it's goodly a word right so aging
[484.72 - 487.92] good or aging bad and that's the
[486.80 - 489.28] difference right there so we're not
[487.92 - 491.04] going to be able to stop the aging
[489.28 - 492.80] process completely because the earth's
[491.04 - 494.64] going around the sun
[492.80 - 497.84] and every time it goes around the sun we
[494.64 - 499.36] age regardless of what but
[497.84 - 501.60] physically
[499.36 - 504.56] everything matters as far as what we put
[501.60 - 507.20] inside our body to stop from oxidizing
[504.56 - 508.96] to stop the oxidation process
[507.20 - 511.92] everything matters
[508.96 - 514.80] to stop all of the decaying that happens
[511.92 - 517.12] inside our body right stop the process
[514.80 - 519.12] of acids eating us up alive stop the
[517.12 - 521.28] process of chemicals and pathogens and
[519.12 - 523.36] everything getting to our
[521.28 - 525.04] bones and getting to our organs and
[523.36 - 526.80] getting to our brain and getting to our
[525.04 - 528.48] liver right
[526.80 - 529.60] all of that matters
[528.48 - 531.60] so
[529.60 - 534.40] when it comes down to it when it comes
[531.60 - 536.16] down to it we want that antioxidant
[534.40 - 538.00] power
[536.16 - 541.04] because that's critical
[538.00 - 542.88] for our survival it just is antioxidants
[541.04 - 545.68] play a huge role
[542.88 - 547.76] in the whole free radical thing so what
[545.68 - 548.56] is the free radical thing anyway what is
[547.76 - 550.32] it
[548.56 - 551.84] it's any kind of toxin that's floating
[550.32 - 553.52] around in our bloodstream in our body
[551.84 - 555.60] any kind of poison that's in the air
[553.52 - 557.36] that we breathe any kind of
[555.60 - 559.44] you know
[557.36 - 560.88] toxic substance that we were born with
[559.44 - 563.04] inside our body passed down from
[560.88 - 565.44] generation from generation
[563.04 - 567.28] anything we get exposed to
[565.44 - 569.84] from anything that's floating around
[567.28 - 571.84] anything we ingest right all of it toxic
[569.84 - 573.84] heavy metals pathogens and everything so
[571.84 - 579.04] basically that's just one summing up one
[573.84 - 581.68] big free radical circus right there and
[579.04 - 584.80] our cells are up against all of that
[581.68 - 588.84] that's what happens so we can age kindly
[584.80 - 594.08] and we can age unkindly right
[588.84 - 596.48] so the key is how we protect ourselves
[594.08 - 598.32] from that aging process at least giving
[596.48 - 599.92] them a shot so as we're putting
[598.32 - 602.00] ourselves through what we put ourselves
[599.92 - 604.96] through all the years of caffeine people
[602.00 - 607.12] have done or all the years of
[604.96 - 610.24] pizza they've done or all the years of
[607.12 - 612.64] burgers or all the years of exposure or
[610.24 - 614.16] whatever it is that they're up against
[612.64 - 617.28] throughout their life all the years of
[614.16 - 619.44] stress all the years of adrenaline
[617.28 - 621.76] it's critical that our cells stand a
[619.44 - 624.40] chance so antioxidants are a big part of
[621.76 - 625.84] it anthocyanins polyphenols antioxidants
[624.40 - 627.92] all matter
[625.84 - 630.32] and so the thing i love about wild
[627.92 - 632.56] blueberry and wild blueberry juice has
[630.32 - 634.00] manganese in it
[632.56 - 636.96] right so it has
[634.00 - 640.24] naturally occurring manganese in it and
[636.96 - 641.52] a very amazing amount of it which is
[640.24 - 645.44] incredible and that's the thing about
[641.52 - 647.12] the wild blueberry manganese is that
[645.44 - 649.12] is that mineral
[647.12 - 651.92] right that links
[649.12 - 653.52] the antioxidant use inside our body and
[651.92 - 655.20] that's the connection right there so
[653.52 - 657.68] manganese is critical when it comes down
[655.20 - 659.36] to antioxidants manganese is critical
[657.68 - 662.48] when it comes down to cells and organs
[659.36 - 664.96] in every single part of our body and so
[662.48 - 666.48] when people drink wild blueberry juice
[664.96 - 668.48] and they say like a family member says
[666.48 - 671.04] wow i feel better
[668.48 - 673.68] because i had some and i feel better
[671.04 - 676.08] or if someone drinks it and they feel
[673.68 - 678.08] like they're stabilizing
[676.08 - 680.32] or they feel like they're feeling
[678.08 - 682.56] stronger or they feel energy come back
[680.32 - 684.32] or they feel a headache go away or they
[682.56 - 686.88] feel right
[684.32 - 688.56] or they feel their dizziness go away
[686.88 - 691.20] i got a friend that's
[688.56 - 692.56] dizzy on and off throughout the day
[691.20 - 693.92] every time
[692.56 - 695.12] they started what they started up with
[693.92 - 696.64] the wild blueberries you start doing the
[695.12 - 698.72] wild blueberry juice they call me up
[696.64 - 700.32] they're like how come it goes away
[698.72 - 701.44] and so it's it's one of these things
[700.32 - 703.28] where
[701.44 - 705.04] and i'm not saying it does that i'm just
[703.28 - 707.36] saying these are experiences people have
[705.04 - 709.52] that i see out there right
[707.36 - 712.32] and so anyway what i love about the wild
[709.52 - 713.52] blueberry juice though is the color
[712.32 - 716.80] it's one of the things i love those
[713.52 - 718.96] anthocyanins that color
[716.80 - 720.88] is very special all in its own so we
[718.96 - 722.96] have to realize what's in that pigment
[720.88 - 724.96] what's going on inside of there all
[722.96 - 726.40] these things matter so anyway we're here
[724.96 - 728.16] i'm making some drinks i just want to

[829.28 - 835.36] people see this it's not sickly sweet
[832.32 - 839.36] like grape juice no way
[835.36 - 842.72] no way it's pleasant it's refreshing
[839.36 - 846.48] it's not sickly sweet at all you can
[842.72 - 848.56] taste the medicinal properties it's an
[846.48 - 850.48] entirely different experience which is
[848.56 - 852.64] incredible you gotta understand like
[850.48 - 855.36] what it takes to actually get these out
[852.64 - 857.44] of the field harvest them
[855.36 - 859.92] get them to the press
[857.44 - 861.76] press them
[859.92 - 864.24] get the juice in the bottle and i'm
[861.76 - 865.84] going to talk about the
[864.24 - 867.20] why the quality matters and everything
[865.84 - 869.52] else that's happening with the quality
[867.20 - 874.00] of this as well so that's important too
[869.52 - 874.00] does not raise blood sugar
[875.20 - 877.68] right
[876.08 - 879.44] low glycemic for the people who are
[877.68 - 880.96] worried about blood sugar like raising
[879.44 - 883.84] blood sugar or anything
[880.96 - 885.76] because the berries are low glycemic
[883.84 - 887.52] fruit that's what that is it's a low
[885.76 - 889.44] glycemic fruit for the people that are
[887.52 - 892.16] worried about that that's a whole nother
[889.44 - 894.24] game all on its own right
[892.16 - 895.76] all right so let's get some wild
[894.24 - 896.88] blueberry juice in here that's what
[895.76 - 899.84] we're gonna do maybe we'll get a
[896.88 - 902.64] close-up to this drink too as well

[1074.00 - 1078.00] but this one's really really tasty
[1078.08 - 1081.12] a little bit of that orange in there and
[1079.44 - 1082.48] that honey
[1081.12 - 1084.48] this is really
[1082.48 - 1086.08] an incredible
[1084.48 - 1088.08] incredible flavor
[1086.08 - 1091.20] let's make another one right here too so
[1088.08 - 1091.92] i'm going to move this one over you guys
[1091.20 - 1093.36] so
[1091.92 - 1095.04] and you guys you can do a lot of
[1093.36 - 1097.44] different things if you just want to
[1095.04 - 1098.56] take a champagne glass
[1097.44 - 1101.20] right
[1098.56 - 1103.20] just a champagne glass alone you can you
[1101.20 - 1104.00] can go that route too because i made
[1103.20 - 1105.84] that
[1104.00 - 1107.36] fancy drink
[1105.84 - 1109.76] a little while ago right but you can
[1107.36 - 1111.28] just do champagne glasses you can do
[1109.76 - 1112.56] wine glasses
[1111.28 - 1116.16] you can do a lot of different things
[1112.56 - 1117.44] with it too when you have people over
[1116.16 - 1119.52] all right so the next one we're gonna
[1117.44 - 1123.84] make is a sparkling wild blueberry juice
[1119.52 - 1123.84] and lime so let's do it
[1124.88 - 1129.44] that one we're using a champagne glass
[1126.96 - 1131.52] here it is okay
[1129.44 - 1133.28] so this is gonna be fun we're gonna put
[1131.52 - 1136.00] a little bit of blueberry juice in this
[1133.28 - 1138.32] one
[1136.00 - 1138.32] we are
[1143.04 - 1146.24] okay
[1144.72 - 1147.60] a little bit of blueberry juice in there
[1146.24 - 1149.68] like that then we're gonna do some
[1147.60 - 1152.00] sparkling water
[1149.68 - 1152.00] next
[1154.56 - 1158.16] we're not going to do ice in this one
[1156.16 - 1159.84] little sparkling water
[1158.16 - 1163.40] here we go
[1159.84 - 1163.40] this is a champagne
[1166.16 - 1169.68] i think we're going a little too high up
[1168.16 - 1173.12] on that
[1169.68 - 1176.40] we're not trying to fill that
[1173.12 - 1176.40] now we're gonna get a lime
[1177.44 - 1181.60] don't throw fruit around when you have
[1180.08 - 1183.76] all this going on
[1181.60 - 1187.84] all this blue juice going around don't
[1183.76 - 1189.84] throw anything that's just my advice
[1187.84 - 1191.92] if you have carpets that's a lime with
[1189.84 - 1194.24] no juice in it how do you like that oh
[1191.92 - 1195.84] we got a little bit in there
[1194.24 - 1198.96] so we're gonna put a little lime juice
[1195.84 - 1200.24] in this one so we got the sparkling
[1198.96 - 1202.24] water
[1200.24 - 1204.84] this is the sparkling wild blueberry
[1202.24 - 1206.48] juice and lime
[1204.84 - 1207.36] drink
[1206.48 - 1208.80] nice
[1207.36 - 1210.40] you don't want you when you're serving
[1208.80 - 1211.68] it you don't want it kind of gross
[1210.40 - 1213.36] looking where there's some lime or
[1211.68 - 1214.64] something on the side let's just clean
[1213.36 - 1216.88] that up
[1214.64 - 1216.88] right
[1217.28 - 1219.68] and then
[1218.56 - 1222.32] this is what we're going to do we're
[1219.68 - 1223.44] going to get another lime
[1222.32 - 1225.12] right here
[1223.44 - 1226.88] we're going to cut this you guys want to
[1225.12 - 1228.48] look at this for a second

[1228.48 - 1232.16] here we are look
[1230.64 - 1235.12] you guys on tick tock we're making
[1232.16 - 1236.24] drinks hang around non-alcoholic drinks

[1264.40 - 1266.64] right
[1266.96 - 1272.00] this is a great one if you have company
[1269.28 - 1273.44] over and one of them is a snob

[1295.44 - 1300.00] sparkling water every single day i
[1297.68 - 1302.24] wouldn't be drinking it
[1300.00 - 1303.84] every hour like you're doing lemon water
[1302.24 - 1305.76] or you're doing some kind of water or
[1303.84 - 1307.28] spring water i wouldn't do it that way
[1305.76 - 1309.28] it's just for fun

[1352.64 - 1356.08] shots every single morning
[1354.56 - 1361.00] and then you can do all kinds of stuff
[1356.08 - 1361.00] you can do the wine thing if you want
[1361.04 - 1364.32] right you can do that like
[1366.00 - 1370.88] i mean honestly i treat this like a wine
[1368.56 - 1371.84] now i'm not a wine drinker
[1370.88 - 1374.48] right
[1371.84 - 1377.20] but you can treat this like a wine
[1374.48 - 1379.44] very easily
[1377.20 - 1381.84] especially if you have company over
[1379.44 - 1382.64] fantastic and it goes great with meals
[1381.84 - 1383.84] too

[1615.44 - 1620.56] with wyman's this is a gift
[1618.48 - 1622.72] in my opinion this product
[1620.56 - 1624.64] because it's it's actually supersedes
[1622.72 - 1626.32] what's out there this is wild you can
[1624.64 - 1627.52] use the code wild when you do it too
[1626.32 - 1630.96] code wild
[1627.52 - 1632.00] wild the code wild right 10 off on any
[1630.96 - 1635.04] order
[1632.00 - 1638.64] incredible what an amazing amazing sale
[1635.04 - 1641.04] which is which is just phenomenal right
[1638.64 - 1642.88] okay but it's a it's a gift
[1641.04 - 1645.84] i mean from heaven really that the wild
[1642.88 - 1647.92] blueberries are even here on this planet
[1645.84 - 1650.80] to help us which is incredible all on
[1647.92 - 1652.72] its own and then the harvesting being
[1650.80 - 1654.24] able to harvest them get them into a
[1652.72 - 1656.48] juice and we'll talk about this this
[1654.24 - 1659.60] juice is not hpp
[1656.48 - 1660.64] and that's something to understand right
[1659.60 - 1662.88] so
[1660.64 - 1664.56] people think they're buying raw juices
[1662.88 - 1667.44] when they're not someone said is this
[1664.56 - 1669.84] raw no it's not raw raw is
[1667.44 - 1670.96] you take the fruit like this
[1669.84 - 1673.04] right
[1670.96 - 1674.24] and you squeeze it and you drink it
[1673.04 - 1676.08] that's raw
[1674.24 - 1677.20] now if you see something that says it's
[1676.08 - 1679.28] raw
[1677.20 - 1681.44] on the shelf and it's got like an
[1679.28 - 1683.12] expiration date of two weeks or a month
[1681.44 - 1685.68] and it's all those juices and they're in
[1683.12 - 1687.60] bottles those aren't raw
[1685.68 - 1690.56] those are not fresh
[1687.60 - 1692.32] those are hpp they're pasteurized so you
[1690.56 - 1694.40] have to understand what's happening so
[1692.32 - 1696.24] you're not getting any raw juice unless
[1694.40 - 1698.32] you take celery or something and you run
[1696.24 - 1701.04] it through a juicer
[1698.32 - 1703.76] or you take a raw fruit but the wild
[1701.04 - 1705.68] blueberries they're only around in north
[1703.76 - 1708.48] america for this very short window of
[1705.68 - 1711.20] harvesting so no one has the chance to
[1708.48 - 1714.00] just get it fresh right meaning like
[1711.20 - 1715.04] picked off well what they do is they
[1714.00 - 1716.40] pick them
[1715.04 - 1717.92] right
[1716.40 - 1719.68] they freeze them
[1717.92 - 1721.68] so we have the frozen wild blueberries
[1719.68 - 1723.12] which is incredible that's one of the
[1721.68 - 1725.44] amazing things about the wild blueberry
[1723.12 - 1726.88] you freeze them right we can also
[1725.44 - 1728.88] press them
[1726.88 - 1730.96] and make them into this incredible juice
[1728.88 - 1733.36] which is a whole other thing too
[1730.96 - 1734.96] but when someone says oh it's not raw
[1733.36 - 1737.04] it's pasteurized what they don't
[1734.96 - 1738.80] understand is every juice that's in the
[1737.04 - 1740.96] market doesn't matter where it is in the
[1738.80 - 1742.88] cold section you think all the juices
[1740.96 - 1744.56] you're getting are raw when they're not
[1742.88 - 1746.00] all those different brands all those
[1744.56 - 1747.52] marketing strategies they have or
[1746.00 - 1749.84] they're fresh and they say raw they're
[1747.52 - 1751.68] not they're actually it should be legal
[1749.84 - 1753.28] when they say that should actually be
[1751.68 - 1755.12] illegal because
[1753.28 - 1757.28] they're not disclosing the fact that
[1755.12 - 1758.96] it's every bit of it's been pasteurized
[1757.28 - 1761.44] and here's the problem
[1758.96 - 1765.12] they're using hpp
[1761.44 - 1768.24] that pasteurization damages
[1765.12 - 1770.48] damages the integrity of those
[1768.24 - 1772.48] phytochemical compounds it damages it
[1770.48 - 1774.40] because they're using
[1772.48 - 1776.24] uh they're using a high pressure
[1774.40 - 1777.44] pasteurization which
[1776.24 - 1779.68] injures
[1777.44 - 1782.08] the cell structure of everything people
[1779.68 - 1784.64] don't realize that so
[1782.08 - 1786.72] they don't do that here right they don't
[1784.64 - 1789.60] use that which is incredible so that
[1786.72 - 1792.40] part alone is off the charts amazing
[1789.60 - 1795.20] which which is a big deal so the
[1792.40 - 1797.20] medicinal properties stay intact that's
[1795.20 - 1798.96] the whole point with this
[1797.20 - 1803.36] and that's what i love right there so
[1798.96 - 1803.36] that's important is all on its own um
[1803.44 - 1809.20] okay so you guys sail wymans.com check
