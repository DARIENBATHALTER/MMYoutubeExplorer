1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
I was born

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,580
and right when I was born had

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,940
pharmaceutical applications now I don't

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,679
have any toxic heavy metals I never had

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,839
any medals passed down from generation

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,619
to generation I never had any Metals

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,260
passed down from my family line

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,000
no okay

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,680
talk about toxic heavy metals right now

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,539
this is day seven medical medium brain

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
shot therapy cleanse challenge but we're

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,700
talking about Metals this is a big deal

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,980
because people have Metals I'm going to

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,620
read about tattoos in a little while too

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,780
which is really interesting too now I'm

16
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,540
not anti-tattoos if somebody wants a

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,059
tattoo I don't like judge anybody for

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,180
tattoos for having ink quite the

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,920
contrary quite the opposite actually

20
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,539
because people like tattoos they get

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,100
tattoos but I'm going to talk about why

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,500
we're doing the

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
toxic heavy metal exposure shot exposure

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,920
ly exposure that's the word right there

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,680
okay so it's important to know we're

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,780
talking about exposure and what happens

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,220
with tattoos so you're going to want to

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,299
hang out for this show what happens with

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:18,479
tattoos is they give you continual

30
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:21,240
exposure for years to come that's why I

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,119
like not only just a heavy metal detox

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,640
right smoothie and heavy metal right

33
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,259
cleanse right in the brain saver books

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,659
not only do I like that I like the

35
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,500
exposure shot because the exposure shot

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,960
is grabbing on to new exposure you can

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,200
have an old tattoo

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,479
but it's releasing brand new exposure

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,640
every day

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,200
for the rest of your life I see people

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,880
that get tattooed on their face they get

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,560
tattooed on their neck they get tattooed

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
behind their ear they get tattooed on

44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,320
their neck

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,759
they get their head shaved and tattooed

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,159
on their scalp and their hair grows back

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,659
over it but I see people they get a lot

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,820
of different tattoos if your tattoo

49
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,799

that toxic heavy metal is being released

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
closer to the brain

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,420
it's critical to do the exposure shot

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,360
ask your doctor what's right for you

57
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,459

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080

right here

111
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,340
exposure to toxic heavy metals is all

112
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,440
around us

113
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,840
you don't think so

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,479
if you took an antibiotic

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,340
you got toxic heavy metal exposure

116
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,220
if you took an antibiotic 10 years ago

117
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,840
you have toxic heavy metal exposure if

118
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,460
you took an antibiotic when you had your

119
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
ear infections when you were five years

120
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,699
old six years old seven years old you

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
had your bronchitis ear infections or

122
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,300
anything else and you took your

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,860
antibiotic I'm not saying don't take

124
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,300
antibiotics or whatever that's not what

125
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,460
this is about ask your doctor what's

126
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,960
right for you I'm saying

127
00:04:53,460 --> 00:05:00,240
you had toxic heavy metal exposure

128
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,460
we're not taught about it so we don't

129
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,380
learn to recognize our sources of

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,139
exposure

131
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,520
we're not taught to recognize the

132
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:10,520
exposure we're not

133
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,199
so we don't learn to recognize our

134
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,759
sources of exposure if we're not taught

135
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,139
about it how do you recognize your

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,199
sources

137
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,900
they're much closer than we think toxic

138
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,320
heavy metals have plenty of avenues to

139
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,120
enter our bodies

140
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,720
from toxic heavy metals that we breathe

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,479
we breathe them in every day every

142
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,360
single breath we take has toxic heavy

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,300
metals in it courteous

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,800
the evil doers dropping it out of the

145
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,900
sky on us

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,759
okay

147
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,280
I don't like to be the messenger of this

148
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,520
information but it is what it is

149
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,740
it falls out of the sky every day

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,720
every single day you took a jog one

151
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,000
morning you're breathing it all in

152
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,720
that's okay we can still Empower

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,020
ourselves and do things for ourselves

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,680
so it's around us

155
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,680
Nicole McCullough says best info ever

156
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,639
exclamation points and best cookbook oh

over a hundred recipes in these brain

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,100
saver books this is more than that

160
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,080
from toxic heavy metals we breathe to

161
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,419
toxic heavy metals that we eat we don't

162
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,720
eat toxic heavy metals

163
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:34,100
it's falling out of the sky on the grass

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,960
that the cows are eating

165
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,900
toxic heavy metals are falling out of

166
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,819
the sky on the grass that the grass-fed

167
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,840
beef cows

168
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,840
are eating

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,060
toxic heavy metals fall on the courtyard

170
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,380
of every chicken

171
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,139
that's

172
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,699
pecking around grabbing bugs and things

173
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,860
like that and everything else toxic

174
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,680
heavy metals are everywhere they're in

175
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,720
our water they're in our air they're in

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
our food you can't avoid it on the

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,259
planet industrialized Metals float

178
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,160
amongst the skies in the atmosphere drop

179
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,660
everywhere on the planet

180
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,620
you can't avoid it but that's okay

181
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,620
that's okay

182
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,639
to toxic heavy metals that we drink to

183
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,740
toxic heavy metals that we bathe in to

184
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,500
toxic heavy metals that we touch or

185
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,120
apply to our skin

186
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,699
that's right

187
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,639
simply touching aluminum foil or a

188
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,340
battery can be enough for their mining

189
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,380
particles of metal to leach into our

190
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,139
bloodstream this isn't about fear and

191
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,300
Chaos it's about

192
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,539
becoming empowered and doing something

193
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,000
about it I would like to know I don't

194
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,940
want to live my life not knowing I don't

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,120
want to go about my days not knowing

196
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,880
I want to know everything what about you

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,039
guys I want to know what's around me I

198
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,660
don't want to just ignore it like it

199
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,880
doesn't exist

200
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,800
I I get it some people do there's a lot

201
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,720
of people out there they just don't want

202
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,120
to know what exists they want to ignore

203
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,660
it they don't want to think that it's

204
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,419
even possible but I want to know

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,539
Courtney M.A says she wants to know

206
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,979
people they can live in Bliss or

207
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,020
ignorance or whatever we want to call it

208
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,879
they just don't want to know what's

209
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,620
happening

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,360
and that's not to mention the metal

211
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,399
particles we can ingest from food

212
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,320
prepared in certain metal cookware or

213
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,800
food and drinks served in metal

214
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,240
containers I do not smack a metal

215
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:47,580
utensil out of a friend's hand

216
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,580
if I see them use a metal utensil

217
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,040
I don't Smack it out of somebody's hands

218
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,040
you know I don't

219
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,839
oh because empowerment

220
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:07,500
is being able to also live in this world

221
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,120
and actually do something about it

222
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,459
when I know I'm doing the heavy metal

detox smoothie

224
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,100
and I know I'm doing the exposure shot

225
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,660
if I happen to use a metal fork and I

226
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,560
get a little steel

227
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,560
rubbed off

228
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,940
I know I'm doing something about it

[Music]

230
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,740
toxic heavy metals can be at our in our

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,700
indoor ear

232
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,940
or outdoor air check this out right air

233
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:48,360
fresheners spew toxic heavy metals

234
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,360
that's why I say we should pull them out

235
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,720
of the plugs the walls throw them in the

236
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,480
trash right air fresheners

237
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,540
that you're spraying

238
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,580
right let me spray the couch let me

239
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,399
spray the chair let me spray the carpet

240
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,839
the air fresheners right have toxic

241
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,260
heavy metals in them so when you're

242
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,180
breathing you're like

243
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,050

colognes and perfumes

I like the smell of that

oh man I don't like the smell clone or

250
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,720
perfume but the smell of that cologne

and perfume Nettles

252
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,160
people need to know they need to be they

253
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,019
need to be taught like that's metal your

254
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,120
smell

255
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,399
toxic heavy metals can be indoor or

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,620
outdoor air especially if we're in the

257
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,019
presence of toxic fragrances oh I said

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,940
it in here I was ahead of myself scented

259
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,019
candles that's another one scented

260
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,779
candles

261
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,839
people don't realize how much metal is

262
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,459
spewing out of there yes in that

263
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,920
fragrance that's blowing out of a

264
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,019
scented candle that's burning out of a

265
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,240
scented candle right

266
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,220
then you got pesticides and then you got

267
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,980
the

268
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,040
Trails up in the sky

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,320
we even annoyingly put toxic heavy

270
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,360
metals directly into and onto our bodies

271
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,060
with certain cosmetics

272
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,079
Pharmaceuticals

273
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:25,079
Beverages and other products right

274
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:29,100
you know like this is well-known

275
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:31,640
information and I will cite that this is

276
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,260
not mine this piece of information

277
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,760
meaning this is all my information from

278
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,920
above right it's very compassions

279
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,100
information but you know the Wizard of

280
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,100
Oz

281
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,079
the movie

282
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:50,339
okay in the early 20th century

283
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,620
and the Wicked Witch of the West I think

284
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,339
had a green face

285
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,980
okay and you can look this up out there

286
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,940
it was a copper

287
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:04,019
application that made her face green

288
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,260
right

289
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:11,339
so for that movie

290
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,920
they did an application of copper on

291
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,200
that actress's face

292
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,560
and

293
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,079
from what The Story Goes her face stayed

294
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,560
green for her entire life

295
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,480
from that copper right

296
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,700
and when we think about that that's

297
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,959
really highly toxic

298
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:36,800
so it was a makeup made out of copper to

299
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,800
make your face look green

300
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,720
but when people don't realize is copper

301
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,000
it's really industrial lies copper that

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,380
same industrialized copper that was in

303
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,779
her makeup

304
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,720
to save copper that people use copper

305
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:54,240
mugs and stuff out of

306
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,880
the same industrialized copper

307
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,100
that when you do copper utensils copper

308
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,380
mugs copper jewelry right you don't want

309
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,279
to play with copper

310
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,600
and there's too much copper available to

311
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,980
play with

312
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,519
we are all high in Copper

313
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,820
not only high in the trace mineral

314
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,399
copper because it's the least

315
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,720
deficient mineral on the planet in every

316
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,839
single food

317
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,459
so not only are we not deficient in

318
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:31,200
Copper Trace mineral coppers but we're

319
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:33,000
saturated and toxic industrialized

320
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,120
copper

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,399
we have not only do the humans on this

322
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,279
planet have an abundance of Trace

323
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,700
mineral copper in US

324
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,279
from the earth we also have too much

325
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,540
industrialized copper in US

326
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,940
people don't know this that's medical

327
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,620
medium information

328
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,180
that's mm info I don't want to confuse

329
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,519
that with the Wicked Witch of the West

330
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,260
when she had the copper makeup that's

331
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,880
not MediCal medium info when she had the

332
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,300
copper makeup and all that that's known

333
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,300
out there

334
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,959

was incredible

351
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:57,060
toxic heavy metals are everywhere

352
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:58,560
we can apply it on our skin with

353
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,839
cosmetics

354
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,459
still in there it's still in cosmetics

355
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,459
it's still in everything is what I was

356
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,260
trying to say

357
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,600
Pharmaceuticals Beverages and other

358
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,760

359
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,980
you'll find extensive details about

360
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,139
toxic heavy metal exposure in this book

361
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,760
I just read that right there

362
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,120
we are getting toxic heavy metal

363
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,980
exposure at a minuscule level on a

364
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,860
continual basis

365
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,740
so we get it every day on a continual

366
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,660
basis so we are exposed

367
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,839
it's not like we're drinking a gallon of

368
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,180
leaded gasoline we're not doing that

369
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,000
Mariah says Where can we find the real

370
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,139

check out the reel

373
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,500
we're getting these exposures repeatedly

374
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,600
in our everyday lives a little bit here

375
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,240
a little bit there you might look at a

376
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,480
single exposure and think no big deal

377
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,399
everybody looks at a single exposure if

378
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
they're aware of that single exposure as

379
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,060
if it's no big deal that's what we do we

380
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,459
don't really

381
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,440
understand it or we don't really care

382
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,940
and we don't really see it as a big deal

383
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,399
that's how it works with toxic heavy

384
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,800
metals and that's how they get you

385
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,320
that's how the evil doers on the planet

386
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,420
get us too it's always these small

387
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,519
amounts through say Pharmaceuticals or

388
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,260
through some other Avenue or the food

389
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,959
chemistry business or whatever it is

390
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,240
industry out there like all of it we

391
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,680
just get it little bit by little bit by

392
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,360
a little bit

393
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,360
Death By A Thousand Cuts its exposure by

394
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,480
a Thousand Cuts is what it is to

395
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,940
exposure by a Thousand Cuts

396
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,000
you might look at a single exposure and

397
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,160
think no big deal just like people will

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,899
often think of a micro dose of

399
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,100
psychedelic drugs huh we mentioned that

400
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,660
in here pretty funny there's a micro

401
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,920
dose chapter inside this book that'll

402
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,920
blow your mind

403
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,660
get it blow your mind

404
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,660
no pun intended though

405
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,579
so people think just like no big deal

406
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,260
with a micro dose of psychedelic drugs

407
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,760
is no big deal because of the trendy

408
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,160
advice about everything in moderation

409
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,980
we're getting poisoned with toxic heavy

410
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,339
metals in moderation

411
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,900
I'm in the brain saver book on page 24.

412
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,860
right here

413
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,860
Incredible Book

414
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,660
we're getting poisoned with toxic heavy

415
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,059
metals in moderation and that may not

416
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,039
seem significant until you step back and

417
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:37,740
look at the bigger picture repeated

418
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,720
exposure adds up and if we don't do

419
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,799
anything about it if we don't do

420
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,900
anything about that repeated exposure it

421
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,460
adds up adds up and then it bites Us in

422
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,500
the butt

423
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,780
at a certain point the toxic heavy

424
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:56,240
metals in her brain and body accumulate

425
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,240
they do they accumulate

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,620
at a certain point

427
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,620
inside her brain and her body

428
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,179
until we reach a large poisoning at some

429
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,640
point later on in life yes

430
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:16,700
although we still won't know it's toxic

431
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,440
heavy metal poisoning when you have

432
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:23,179
depersonalization anxiety depression OCD

433
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,179
bipolar schizophrenia

434
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,620
memory problems

435
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,900
focusing concentration issues

436
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,600
Alzheimer's dementia

437
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,400
will get older region expiration date

438
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
where everything goes wrong from

439
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,640
collecting so many toxic heavy metals

440
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,880
inside our brain and we'll never know

441
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,880
what did it we hit our expiration date

442
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,780
we have an expiration date

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,760
we do

444
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,260
we do

445
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,320
and

446
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,880
it's Death By A Thousand Cuts here on

447
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,580
planet Earth

448
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,980
and planet earth has a lot of Darkness

449
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,960
on it so there's also death by one cut

450
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,360
too on planet Earth

451
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,400
by evil people and evil doers but death

452
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,380
by a Thousand Cuts

453
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,880
even as someone who lives in a bubble

454
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,039
and they don't know really what's going

455
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,200
on and they don't have too many worries

456
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,580
in the world or they have a lot of money

457
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,380
or whatever it is and they're just doing

458
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,140
their thing every day they're still

459
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,500
getting a death by a Thousand Cuts

460
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,500
everybody is here on planet Earth

461
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,360
Nicholas Russell years before my

462
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,120
grandmother's death the last time I saw

463
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,780
her she had no idea who I was and

464
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,320
wouldn't even look at me damned medals

465
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,240
truly I mean the mm info about Metals

466
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,320
creating dementia and Alzheimer's out

467
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,860
there in the world's powerful

468
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,900
information because at least we know and

469
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,760
we can do something about it for the

470
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,440
future we can do something about it for

471
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,960
the future

472
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,020
because you know now so

473
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,000
that's how it works we have to somehow

474
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,799
get enough people to know and I feel

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,140
terrible for so many people that may not

476
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,559
have known through the years I've seen a

477
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,179
lot of people have so many difficulties

478
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,520
Tracy says what's the target audience

479
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,740
for this book

480
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,080
the target audience

481
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,120
I mean the books are made for the

482
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,880
chronically ill for people who have been

483
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,960
through hell and back people who are

484
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,760
also

485
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,760
they've been sick for 10 years they've

486
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,100
been sick for 20 years people who

487
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,080
have seen it all done everything 10

488
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,760
doctors 20 doctors Specialists

489
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,220
neurologists everything

490
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,620
the brain saver books are incredible

491
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,120
books

492
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,860
I guess if you want to use the term

493
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,799
target audience I've never used that

494
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,400
term but if you want to use that term

495
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,200
that you were mentioning I would say

496
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,200
it's for people

497
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,860
who have been through enough seen enough

498
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,539
and they they need the answers

499
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,700
and

500
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:02,580
honestly it's for anybody of course

501
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,620
who's sick but

502
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,240
like we've talked about before spirit

503
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,280
and I

504
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,780
if you first get sick chances are you're

505
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,580
not going to grab a medical medium book

506
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,900
you're going to go to a doctor then to

507
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,860
another doctor I want people to go to

508
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,720
their doctors

509
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,280
but before they grab a medical medium

510
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,900
book and bring it to their doctor that's

511
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,059
going to be a while so people have to go

512
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,980
on the Merry-Go-Round they have to try

513
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:26,580
every Trend and everything from coffee

514
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,780
enemas to sodium bicarbonate poisoning

515
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,059
too

516
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,220
alkaline National Water machines which

517
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,960
only create more heavy metal toxicity to

518
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,440
everything they have to go through all

519
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:39,299
that and then microbiome tests and they

520
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,580
have to do fecal matter transplants

521
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,260
implants and they have to do all that

522
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,960
before they find the medical medium

523
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,700
books they have to do all that and then

524
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,440
some and they're still having their

525
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,780
neurological symptoms and finally they

526
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,580
say you know what

527
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,780
I'm just going to try one of those

528
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,780
medical medium books

529
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,539
I could talk about that all day

530
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,520
singing sweetly says a decade ago I had

531
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,740
amalgam fillings taken out and I

532
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,080
remember having such a bad emotional

533
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,640
experience for months after that and had

534
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,860
no clue what happened

535
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,860
from the Mercury outcasting

536
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,400
see

537
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,900
um kalasha says it is okay to drink

538
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,360
heavy metal is it okay to drink heavy

539
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,940
metal detox smoothie

540
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,120
if we have an amalgam filling in our

541
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,120
mouth

542
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,039
I'm wanting to have mine removed but not

543
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,100
sure if I can start this movie first

544
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,539
or I should wait till it's out I have

545
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,640
doctors ask me that question all the

546
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,220
time and I recently told a physician who

547
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,580
was asking me that for himself and for a

548
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,659
patient of his and I said to him that it

549
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,840
was fine

550
00:22:54,659 --> 00:23:00,179
absolutely in fact

551
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,919
um I have family members that have

552
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,760
amalgam fillings from

553
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,740
100 years ago whatever and they do the

554
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,240
heavy metal detox smoothie every single

555
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,280
day ask what's right for you ask your

556
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,400
doctor what's right for you

557
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,320
um but I do

558
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,080
um I did talk to a doctor recently about

559
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,360
his amalgam filling and his patience

560
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,179
amalgam filling and they're on the heavy

561
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,880
metal detox movie because what what it's

562
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:28,740
doing is it's Gathering any metal that's

563
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,140
being released from your amalgam

564
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:34,919
fillings every single day that's that's

565
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,020
recent exposure so what we're doing here

566
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,600
is we're talking about the toxic heavy

567
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:41,820
metal exposure shot right now right

568
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,880
but that's like recent exposure because

569
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,640
when Mercury is leaching from amalgams

570
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,220
it's its recent exposure every day a

571
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,900
little bit every day right

572
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,100
but that's the same thing with tattoos

573
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,780
there's Mercury and Tattoos there's

574
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,720
toxic heavy metals and Tattoos so that's

575
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,880
that's everyday recent exposure

576
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,679
and that's what I like the exposure shot

577
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,020
too so but the heavy metal detox

578
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,539
smoothie I recommend for family and

579
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,460
friends that have amalgam fillings

580
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,080
regardless yeah

581
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,419
but ask your doctor what's right for you

582
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,500
I have recommendations in the book of

583
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,380
how

584
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,059
not to just take out all your amalgam

585
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,440
fillings at once

586
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:25,380
I talk about information about how to

587
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,419
you know like what would be

588
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,740
a good way of getting amalgam fillings

589
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,900
out of your mouth so I do have

590
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,860
information in here too like I talk

591
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,120
about

592
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,520
if it's broken or falling apart

593
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,940
right that's a great time to get it done

594
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,500
you know I talk about that but I I also

595
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,179
talk about if someone has a whole bunch

596
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,460
of amalgam fillings in their mouth and

597
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,260
they're not causing like the tooth is

598
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,260
still okay the Magnum filling is still

599
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,940
okay

600
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,820
that I tend to tell family and friends

601
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,620
you know you leave them in but if they

602
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,780
do want them out if someone does want

603
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,000
one out

604
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,640
I tell family and friends

605
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,980
don't take them all out at once

606
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,679
on the same day

607
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:15,320
you know I've seen people get like 12

608
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:19,640
out or 20 out in one day

609
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,740
and that's medical meme information

610
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,960
SOC has recommended not to get

611
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,520
20 out in one day so that but it's in

612
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,520
the books that information in detail

613
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,720
okay

614
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:37,220
so let's keep on reading a little bit

615
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,960
this is powerful information I'm excited

616
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,480
let's move on a little bit to the next

617
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,279
part I was going to read which I'm going

618
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,960

619
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,460
so

620
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:52,940
I'm going to go into a different section

621
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,940

622
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,559

you know sign up go to medicalme.com

632
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,039
you're wondering what I was doing I was

633
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,039
trying to pull my pocket out here and

634
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:33,419
all right so we're talking about tattoos

635
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,380
I know a lot of people have tattoos I am

636
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:37,500
not

637
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,419
shaming anybody for a tattoo far from it

638
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,400
you want a tattoo that's what you want

639
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,440
you go get a tattoo if that's you if

640
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,299
that's what you want to do I'm not even

641
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,760
be I'm not even being sarcastic at all

642
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:51,600
on any level people have ink

643
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,620
so many people have ink okay and

644
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
um

645
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,880
I'm just telling you that if people have

646
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,559
ink that's what they got all right

647
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,620
totally understand but I want to talk

648
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,940
about it for a little bit for a minute

649
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,860
tattoos are a source of toxic heavy

650
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,320
metal exposure now before I go any

651
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,220
further I'm sure a few of you might be

652
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,779
like

653
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,580
that's

654
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:16,500
because medical meme doesn't understand

655
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,539
I get cruelty free ink vegan ink and

656
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,559
it's cruelty free

657
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:25,260
and my you know tattoo guy tells me

658
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,140
there's no Metals in it

659
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,720
that's

660
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,240
that's

661
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,679
ink has to have metal in it or it's not

662
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,779
going to show itself through your skin

663
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,140
when the sunlight or light from your

664
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:42,360
house or light from your room hits it

665
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,419
it has Metals in it

666
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,679
that's what causes it to pop and reflect

667
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,260
light

668
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,360
Through Your Skin if tattoo ink didn't

669
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,120
have Metals in it

670
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,460
you would wouldn't be able to see the

671
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,240
details of your tattoos

672
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:04,860
that's why as your tattoos age

673
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,159
as years go on the metal is aging and

674
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,520
leaving the skin that's why tattoos fade

675
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,320
as you get older the reason why your

676
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,140
tattoo doesn't pop

677
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,679
when you got you got your tattoo at 20

678
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,679
years old

679
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,940
popping meaning it pops you see it

680
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,220
because of

681
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:30,120
of toxic heavy metals

682
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,299
but then when you're 50 years old

683
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,520
or 60 years old it doesn't pop anymore

684
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,559
it fades right

685
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,240
it's fading because so much of the metal

686
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,520
is leaving

687
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,820
the skin and it's been going into your

688
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,840
bloodstream for 50 years 40 years

689
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,880
Macaulay says remember when you made

690
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,240
that video with a big tattoo on your arm

691
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,460
yeah I do yeah

692
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,360
there's a whole bunch of tattoos on my

693
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,400
arm

694
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,260
I do remember Uma

695
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,340
thank you for reminding me that's pretty

696
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,039
funny

697
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,400
it is I put info about toxic heavy

698
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,500
metals in all ink and now science is

699
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,299
trying to write it write about it and

700
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,640
you'll see articles being put out now

701
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:16,760
even saying organic ink

702
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,760
2 has Metals in it so by the way

703
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,980
the

704
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:26,100
metal free ink Theory

705
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,860
okay that was out there

706
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:31,679
right first of all the awareness that I

707
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:35,159
put out there about ink having metals

708
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,740
alarmed the tattoo ink world

709
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,840
right so the tattoo ink world started

710
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,820
shifting gears and they started moving

711
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,760
they started moving to cruelty free

712
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,919
tattoo ink which is

713
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,659
um which is a different type of vegan

714
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,460
ink and all that right all these

715
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,659
different ones and they moved to that

716
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,039
and they're like well this these are

717
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,360
better inks these are better inks then

718
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,340
everybody's like what do they have metal

719
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,320
in it oh no these don't have that they

720
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,960
all have metal in it right

721
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:05,159
but I got I got a lot of

722
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,179
for blowing that one up I got over the

723
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,000
years

724
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,520
telling that info that piece of

725
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,860
information messaging out about how ink

726
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
has metal right it caused a lot of

727
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,840
problems and then

728
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,899
all the people who got Inc

729
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:25,740
from so-called better sources

730
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:28,080
were upset because it was a better ink

731
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,600
quality but still had battle in it and

732
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,880
then they felt tricked and jaded so then

733
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,039
I got a lot of for that because

734
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,539
there's a whole bunch of people a whole

735
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,440
bunch of vegans

736
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:43,020
and you know and keto animal protein

737
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,820
people who got ink

738
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,880
and then when the word got out that

739
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,240
their cruelty free ink still has metal

740
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,120
in it I got a lot of again

741
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,559
see so people have no idea how much crap

742
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,320
I get

743
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,940
Jason P says so a tattoo would be

744
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,740
invisible without Metals no not

745
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,980
invisible but that's a good point Not

746
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,840
Invisible it just wouldn't pop and the

747
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,240
detail wouldn't be there

748
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,880
the detail

749
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,440
and it would fade really quick fade

750
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,720
really quick like say you're 20 years

751
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,760
old see Jason say you're 22 years old

752
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,440
whatever 25 years old maybe you're 30

753
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,159
whatever say you're 30.

754
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,440
and you get a brand new tattoo

755
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,539
if there wasn't metal in it

756
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
it would fade really quick it would fade

757
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:33,600
in weeks and in months a couple years

758
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,299
you just have to be fading

759
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,059
but the reason why metal is in all

760
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:44,059
tattoo ink is so that that reflection

761
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:44,059
occurs metal reflects light

762
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,980
so you can't just put metal free ink in

763
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:55,200
your on your neck your face your hands

764
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,059
you know I know a lot of people get ink

765
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,620
on their their Knuckles and stuff they

766
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,039
get them on their fingers their Knuckles

767
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,039
right

768
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,840
they wouldn't be invisible then it just

769
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:08,760
would fade quick and it wouldn't pop

770
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,320
Erica Malek says if someone gets their

771
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,880
tattoos removed are they protecting

772
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,460
themselves from further especially my

773
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,940
recommendation is don't get tattoos

774
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,940
removed

775
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,320
unless you hate the tattoo that much and

776
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,320
you're somebody that like you know Ben

777
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,720
loves Jessica

778
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,520
and you know you guys break up and all

779
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,740
of a sudden somebody's so upset like

780
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,020
Ben's so upset he can't take it anymore

781
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,179
and he's got two choices he can tattoo

782
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,399
over Ben loves Jessica

783
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,340
he can tattoo over that

784
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,399
or he can remove it

785
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:48,539
that's up to him you know but the late

786
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,980
the laser removal of removing toxic

787
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:52,020
heavy metals

788
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,179
from your being removing your your

789
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,580
tattoo sorry the laser removal of

790
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:59,039
removing your tattoo can make the tattoo

791
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,159
Leach fast

792
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,440
the Laser's not getting rid of the metal

793
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
is pushing it into your bloodstream

794
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,539
that's why

795
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,940
a friend of mine had like removal laser

796
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:14,279
removal of a tattoo

797
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:16,340
he was so sick and he's like why the

798
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,440
hell am I so sick and I'm like because

799
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,799
you just got all that metal dumped into

800
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,399
your bloodstream fast that stuff's going

801
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,720
to your brain going to your liver

802
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,360
so

803
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,620
like right now tattoos are in big time

804
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,860
right

805
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,820
it's not just for like the Navy and the

806
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,559
army

807
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,620
in the Air Force

808
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:42,720
the tattoos aren't just for bikers right

809
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,279
they're not just for bikers anymore

810
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,620
they're for like football players

811
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,120
they're for like you know they're for

812
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,440
basketball players football players

813
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,760
they're for soccer players like

814
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,159
everybody's Inked Up they're for

815
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,860
everybody right

816
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:59,039
so but what I see when I see everybody

817
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:01,080
getting that much ink I'm like holy crap

818
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,059
and everybody's got a sleeve

819
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,440
all the football players have sleeves

820
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,419
I'm like dude

821
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,620
if you don't learn about how to get

822
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,480
medals out of your bloodstream

823
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,399
throughout your life that stuff is going

824
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,899
to go to the brain

825
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:14,760
and yours is going to be you know

826
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,820
dealing with Alzheimer's

827
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,859
I see all the NBA and all like NFL and

828
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,139
everybody and they're just Inked Up from

829
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,480
their arms are Inked Up they're Inked Up

830
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:27,659
in the whole body I'm like what

831
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,580
it's like oh man sure you're in shape

832
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,339
now you're working out you're an athlete

833
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,260
pro athlete but down the road you gotta

834
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:36,480
get the medals out

835
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,020
medical medium I just want to say this

836
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,659
medical medium is not common sense

837
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,119
because there's nothing common about it

838
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,740
it's mind-blowing information that sets

839
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,240
the stage for the frontier of all

840
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,859
alternative medicine at this point for

841
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,379
the most part

842
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,659
it sets the stage for information out

843
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:59,880
there because it makes sense

844
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,859
so mm info is not common sense mm info

845
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,119
just makes sense there's a difference

846
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:08,220
right there it's like whoa that

847
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,880
makes sense right like that kind of

848
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,880
thing like whoa

849
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,500
I've been swearing a lot ever since I

850
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,260
did

851
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,880
the Sarah Foster and Aaron Foster

852
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,440
podcast

853
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,140
episode

854
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,300
they were swearing they got me swearing

855
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,720
and then swearing a little more because

856
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,720
of it

857
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,740
I have to let them know anyway

858
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,300
Health with Liz is laughing right now

859
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,859
look the point is what I'm trying to say

860
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,960
I'm not done with tattoo talk though you

861
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:41,220
guys I got tattoo talk if you're not

862
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,660
interested it's okay hang out we're

863
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,700
doing the shot exposure shot because

864
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,680
you've probably got metal exposure from

865
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,900
doing all kinds of other stuff

866
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,940
it just makes sense the medical medium

867
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,400
information it's not common sense it

868
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,099
doesn't contradict itself and only puts

869
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,359
all the details together and builds upon

870
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,880
itself

871
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,400
the laser removal

872
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,060
for ink so you can get rid of your

873
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,280
tattoo pushes the metal

874
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:12,500
a laser going over your skin cannot take

875
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,500
the metal out of your body magically

876
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
you know whatever that laser whatever

877
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,560
that tattoo is I know a lot of people

878
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,480
have words written on their ribs and

879
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,400
stuff it's like like that that scripture

880
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,320
like a big thing with tattoos is

881
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,180
scripture it's like a whole sentence

882
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,880
going across the ribs the whole sentence

883
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,260
going across their back right we I

884
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,240
noticed that a lot of guys and girls

885
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,160
they're getting like they're getting

886
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,440
um they're getting words of wisdom from

887
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,480
somewhere like a quote or something from

888
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,300
somewhere and they have it written over

889
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,960
here on their forearms maybe they have

890
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,960
something like

891
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,460
you know some cool quote right

892
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,619
not making fun of it I'm just saying

893
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,240
that that's how much ink is out there

894
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,920
it's that many people have ink it's

895
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,200
people you don't even expect to have ink

896
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,960
and they got tattoos everywhere

897
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,240
it's okay to have a tattoo

898
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,020
but I think knowing

899
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,700
more about it is also really okay think

900
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,560
about that

901
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,579
so

902
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,839
um

903
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,940
yeah

904
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:17,160
helpful as words of wisdom right people

905
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,520
have the scripture on them whatever kind

906
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,160
of like you see it I saw somebody like I

907
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,780
saw somebody pretty recently right on

908
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,359
social media and they had like a

909
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,040
paragraph written on their chest it was

910
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,260
like a paragraph and it was written all

911
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,579
like nice

912
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,160
I was like

913
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,900
that's fine you can get a paragraph

914
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,040
written on your chest or your back or

915
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,640
something but

916
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,920
what's going on is this so back to Jason

917
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,260
you said that would the ink just

918
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,900
disappear be invisible that's what it

919
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,579
was be invisible if the metal wasn't in

920
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,680
there no it wouldn't be invisible it

921
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:55,859
would just be blotchy

922
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,460
and fade it looking

923
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:03,000
early on

924
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,200
especially later on like turn to crap

925
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,200
that's what it would be

926
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:13,220
so tattoos

927
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:17,760
okay for example okay

928
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:21,420
historically check this out

929
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,079
right indigenous cultures using tattoo

930
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,079
ink

931
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,839
right handmade batches

932
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,400
and then they would take a sharp

933
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,079
Sharp

934
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,839
Hardwood

935
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,060
pencil and they would Pierce her skin

936
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,520
with the ink

937
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,859
to make tattoos

938
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,260
right

939
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:47,520
people don't realize the mixture they

940
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,700
used

941
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:55,020
were deposits of metals

942
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,940
that they mind their self and ORD their

943
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,560
self

944
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,920
okay

945
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,380
so indigenous cultures that you that

946
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,280
made tattoos

947
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,280
going back

948
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:12,859
would unearth deposits of minerals

949
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,940
and they would crush it

950
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,980
with anthocyanins

951
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,380
right color

952
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,619
that they would get from plants

953
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,300
then they would but but it was metal it

954
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,920
was all metal

955
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,200
and they would

956
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,300
push it into their skin and then when

957
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,960
the wound would heal

958
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,900
you would see your tattoo clear as day

959
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,440
Sun hits it clear as day boo now in

960
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,440
modern day

961
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,040
it's manufactured

962
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,680
by the industry

963
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,480
and metal has to be in it

964
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,480
in order to make it pop

965
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,839

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,680
information that makes complete sense

1002
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,200
amen

1003
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,380
amen

1004
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,320
I tell Spirit of compassion all the time

1005
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,760
why do you make so much sense

1006
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,760
all the time

1007
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,000
okay so let's read a little bit about

1008
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,680
tattoos oh tattoos tattoos the teaser a

1009
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,200
source of toxic heavy metal exposure the

1010
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,180
ink from a tattoo is basically On A Time

1011
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,920
release you know time release right time

1012
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,079
release

1013
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,960
ink

1014
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:01,099
Is On A Time release inside of us

1015
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:05,900
leaching metal slowly from the Derma

1016
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,900
into the bloodstream over a lifetime

1017
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,380
from the bloodstream those toxic heavy

1018
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:12,380
metals find their way to the brain

1019
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,940
so when we get ink on our body

1020
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,099
slowly it's just going to the brain

1021
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,099
every day for the rest of her life

1022
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,339
from the bloodstream those toxic Metals

1023
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,500
find their way to the brain where they

1024
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:31,859
end up residing in brain tissue

1025
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,079
as of today there are no sources of

1026
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:37,440
tattooing that are free of toxic heavy

1027
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,020
metals I repeat

1028
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,359
so every time when somebody like throws

1029
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,119
it at me and they have I mean honestly

1030
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,579
if we weren't so shadowed

1031
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,500
and we were open to like whatever it

1032
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,040
just anybody just pop it on whatever

1033
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,260
that's browsing through um IG or

1034
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,099
whatever we weren't so shadowed

1035
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:02,220
oh my God people would be so peed off

1036
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:06,000
right now with me talking about there's

1037
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:08,940
no heavy metal free ink there are so

1038
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,220
many like hipsters going to their like

1039
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,040
tattoo people too and they're being told

1040
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:15,960
there's no metal it's cruelty free blah

1041
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,819
blah blah and they're just they just

1042
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,339
don't know

1043
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:22,500
so as of today there are no sources of

1044
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:24,780
tattooing that are free of toxic heavy

1045
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,880
metals not even tattoo inks that are

1046
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,579
vegan and cruelty free

1047
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,280
in order for tattoo ink to be seen

1048
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:36,200
clearly through the skin they're half

1049
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:40,440
there have to be metals

1050
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,599
inside the tattoo ink as light hits your

1051
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,240
skin from the Sun or any source of light

1052
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,119
it reflects off the metal

1053
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,940
inside the tattoo ink under the skin

1054
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,339
that reflection allows a tattoo to pop

1055
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,560
and be seen clearly

1056
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:58,500
why am I yelling

1057
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,240
as the years go by and Tattoos toxic

1058
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,700
heavy metals are Time released deeper

1059
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,280
into your bloodstream tattoos fade

1060
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,560
the light reflecting off your body ink

1061
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,420
doesn't have as much to reflect off of

1062
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,819
anymore that's why it fades throughout

1063
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,420
the years toxic heavy metals within the

1064
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,900
ink were what gave the tattoos their

1065
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,900
clarity

1066
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,220
here's a cool paragraph right here I

1067
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,040
hope this makes you feel better

1068
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,680
if you already have tattoos

1069
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,920
you don't have to remove them

1070
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,380
please do not worry and think you have

1071
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,960
to get all your ink removed do not do

1072
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,119
that in my opinion in my personal

1073
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,680
opinion I would recommend against that

1074
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,720
unless you have some tattoo that says

1075
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,579
something on it that you just don't want

1076
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,560
anymore so badly and you already planned

1077
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,660
on removing it and that's your life and

1078
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,420
that's your body and whatever but I mean

1079
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,660
I'm not saying you have to do anything

1080
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,780
Rhonda says louder for the people in the

1081
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,780
back

1082
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,099
that's really funny if you already have

1083
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,599
tattoos you don't have to remove them

1084
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,640
instead make sure you're following

1085
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:10,920
medical medium protocols to stop up and

1086
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,140
expel the metals as their Time released

1087
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,319
into your bloodstream so the metals

1088
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,760
don't build up in your brain

1089
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,560
ask your doctor what's right for you

1090
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,700
take the book to hit your doctor him or

1091
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,040
her

1092
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,780
Julie is the light says why does the Sun

1093
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,780
make mine fade

1094
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,420
the sun doesn't make a tattoo fade

1095
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,680
the Sun

1096
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,680
Tans the skin

1097
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,880
so

1098
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:44,280
and the tanning of the skin can make it

1099
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,440
seem like the Tattoo's fading if you get

1100
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,880
no sun whatsoever

1101
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,599
at all

1102
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:53,520
the tattoo won't be faded if you had the

1103
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,140
tattoo for a very long time it's

1104
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,380
naturally fading

1105
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,540
because the metals are leaving the ink

1106
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,819
if you choose to remove a tattoo because

1107
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,440
you don't like your tattoo anymore the

1108
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:06,839
procedure could release more metal into

1109
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,420
your bloodstream faster

1110
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:12,119
so following the heavy metal detox guide

1111
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,640
guidance from chapter 44 and 45 will be

1112
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,500
wise then two after you consult your

1113
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,500
doctor on what's right for you

1114
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,859
so we we've read some cool metal stuff

1116
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:35,099

1118
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,700

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,500
scratching tattoos for God's sake I'm

1120
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,500
just scratching tattoos

1121
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,660
that's all I'm doing

1122
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,960
I'm not even like there's so much

1123
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,960
information

1124
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,619
I got like information in here about

1125
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,760
vaporized heavy metals that's

1126
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,160
interesting

1127
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,160
I got all kinds of information in here

1128
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,660
samples of toxic copper exposure I can

1129
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,339
talk about copper exposure a little bit

1130
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,079
because I think people have a lot of

1131
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,960
toxic exposure but you know what we

1132
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:11,220
might do that on one of our other ones

1133
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,900
coming up

1134
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:15,300
okay

1135
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,819
so all right so let's head to the heavy

1136
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,920
metal detox explosion oh oh half time

1137
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:21,920
half time pull it together

1138
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,280
you guys want to get the robot

1139
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,550
[Music]

1140
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,960
robot

1141
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,400
all right

1142
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,619
we're moving on let's make the shot

1143
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,240
you know what I could talk about toxic

1144
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,460
heavy metals

1145
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,380
forever talk about them and talk about

1146
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,260
them talk about them but I also want to

1147
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,839
show you this really quick too

1148
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,060
let's show you the shot we're doing are

1149
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:23,660
you guys you got your book this is Page

1150
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:27,000
462 right here

1151
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,460
462. right here

1152
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,560
toxic heavy metal exposure so let's read

1153
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:36,619
about that a little bit real quick

1154
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,619
this exposure shot is especially geared

1155
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,619
page 462. this exposure shot is

1156
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,660
especially geared for recent exposure

1157
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:47,760
for toxic heavy metals

1158
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,520
helping to stop toxic heavy metals from

1159
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,920
settling deep in the body

1160
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,720
this shot can be used as an additional

1161
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,000
therapy to the heavy metal detox

1162
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,780
smoothies

1163
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,180
thank you

1164
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:03,480
heavy metal detox

1165
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:05,760
additional to that which are geared to

1166
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,460
extract toxic heavy metals that have

1167
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,680
already settled in the organs while

1168
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,079
providing ongoing support for toxic

1169
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:16,740
heavy metal exposure in the bloodstream

1170
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:19,500
lymph or intestinal tract

1171
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:23,339
ideal times to use this toxic heavy

1172
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,020
metal exposure shot include

1173
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:26,700
just so you know science of research

1174
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,920
only think that you have toxic heavy

1175
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,480
metals in the blood if it could be

1176
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,460
tested there they don't believe it's in

1177
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,660
the organs science and research doesn't

1178
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,319
know what's in the organs it's medical

1179
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,319
meme information

1180
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,359
ideal time to use the toxic Head Metal

1181
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,400
exposure shot include when you had

1182
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,720
dental work done

1183
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,040
I know what some of you guys are

1184
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,440
thinking you're thinking I didn't get it

1185
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,800
amalgam feeling removed and I didn't get

1186
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,460
an amalgam filling installed I had a

1187
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,380
ceramic filling installed aw therefore I

1188
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,599
don't need to use the exposure shot for

1189
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,760
that

1190
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,040
having dental work done such as getting

1191
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,040
Mercury amalgams fillings removed or

1192
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:14,339
getting new fillings of any kind

1193
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:16,800
including all composites

1194
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:19,500
if you just went to the dentist and you

1195
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,400
had Composites put in

1196
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:26,700
you still need to do the exposure shot

1197
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,480
because all composite they all have

1198
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:32,819
metal in them all Composites they all

1199
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,599
have that in them any dental work

1200
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:35,599
procedures

1201
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,240
ideal times to use a toxic heavy metal

1202
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:41,940
exposure shot

1203
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,680
when you had fluoride treatments

1204
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,900
retainers

1205
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,140
or braces

1206
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,900
if you had retainers

1207
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:54,059
braces done fluoride treatment so you

1208
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:56,700
might be saying hey W I don't do the

1209
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:59,640
fluoride treatment sorry I know

1210
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:02,400
fluoride's bad for me I I shouldn't do

1211
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,680
it but you had fluoride treatments when

1212
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,700
you were younger that's when you might

1213
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,559
want to think about the heavy metal

1214
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,680
detox smoothies and so forth and all

1215
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:09,680
that

1216
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,640
Alzheimer's and Dementia being toxic

1217
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,880
heavy metals caused this medical medium

1218
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,040
information some doctors in science are

1219
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,720
taking it but no studies can back it up

1220
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,640
and no studies were done to show there

1221
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,140
were Metals in somebody's brain they

1222
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:28,619
can't even determine it therefore

1223
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,780
they're making it up if they wanted to

1224
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,099
claim science is behind it it's not it

1225
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,500
comes from medical medium information

1226
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:37,020
any paper they've ever showed or an

1227
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,579
article saying that Alzheimer's is

1228
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,440
caused by toxic head metals does not

1229
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:43,260
have a study to back it up

1230
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,000
there's no way to determine or test for

1231
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,400
that it's not even possible you would

1232
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,380
have to follow an Alzheimer's case from

1233
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,839
the day they were born from when they

1234
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:55,079
were they were in utero from when they

1235
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,420
when they were birthed all the way to 80

1236
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,040
years until they died with Alzheimer's

1237
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,400
and you would have to study their entire

1238
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,839
life all the way for 80 years and then

1239
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,400
when they died you would have to cut

1240
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,319
open their brain and you would have to

1241
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,119
actually do an analysis on the metals

1242
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:11,700
and you'd have to biopsy their brain

1243
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,260
along the way as they were alive and you

1244
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,359
know biopsy in the brain as they were

1245
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:17,160
live for 80 years wouldn't be a good

1246
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,839
thing so what I'm saying is there is no

1247
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,140
test there is no study there is no

1248
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:24,059
identification or any study test or any

1249
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:26,700
peer review study that shows Metals

1250
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,619
cause Alzheimer's dementia it is medical

1251
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:31,020
medium information it came from above

1252
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:35,460
because therefore that's where it came

1253
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,960
from because yeah they didn't do a study

1254
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,980
and I've been talking about it for 35

1255
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,520
years

1256
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,520
okay

1257
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,339
thank you guys

1258
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,420
for hanging in there check it out have

1259
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:47,460
fluoride treatments like I said

1260
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,220
retainers or braces

1261
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:53,339
apply this exposure shot if you eat

1262
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:57,680
cooked food on a grill

1263
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:57,680
or from another type of cookout

1264
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:03,180
use the exposure shot if you consume

1265
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,660
restaurant food or beverages at coffee

1266
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:10,079
chains ooh coffee chains coffee chains

1267
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:13,260
coffee chains I will have my double

1268
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:17,760
mocha soy latte

1269
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:20,339
double Triple Espresso cold coffee ice

1270
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,260
coffee drink please

1271
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:27,780
in your toxic metal contaminated water

1272
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,119
that would be fantastic

1273
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,260
oh my God thank you

1274
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,260
I'm ready for the day

1275
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,319
I got an Alzheimer's and Dementia

1276
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,000
chapter and brain saver it is packed

1277
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:40,920
with details that will blow your mind

1278
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,780
when you read it about Alzheimer's

1279
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,339
dementia and the truth about what metals

1280
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:48,000
do in all of it did you guys read it yet

1281
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:52,160
oh my God I read it the other day

1282
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,160
because yes I have to read these books

1283
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm not a genius that can retain all

1284
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,680
eight volumes of information from Spirit

1285
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,480
compassion above

1286
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,700
I'm a regular

1287
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,099
person with just an ability to hear the

1288
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,800
words and write them down but it's not

1289
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,780
like I can remember every single word in

1290
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,420
all of these books

1291
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:15,119
I'm not in Einstein

1292
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,220
I'm not just saying this I'm not just

1293
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,319
saying it's the cause

1294
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,240
but I'm saying I'm not just saying that

1295
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:23,220
Metals cause Alzheimer's and Dementia

1296
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,819
that's one aspect that I'm saying how

1297
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:31,020
how it causes it it's mind-blowing

1298
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:31,020
it's the how and why okay

1299
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,700
metal Expo heavy metal detox exposure

1300
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,700
heavy metal exposure shot

1301
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,140
if you consume restaurant food or

1302
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,540
Beverages and coffee chains

1303
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,800
where town or city tap water is used in

1304
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:53,300
food and drink preparation

1305
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,300
hence every single coffee chain

1306
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:58,500
use this exposure shot if you breathe in

1307
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,780
air fresheners fragrances perfumes

1308
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,800
colognes scented candles detergents or

1309
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,800
fabric softeners

1310
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,960
we're going to create a fabric softener

1311
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,420
that has a smell that only grows for the

1312
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,000
next hundred years

1313
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,200
put one sheet of this fabric softener in

1314
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,020
your machine

1315
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,880
and it'll smell like this terrifying

1316
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:25,160
dangerous deadly chemical that's

1317
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,160
produced in a chemical plant somewhere

1318
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,440
it's gonna smell like potpourri

1319
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:33,300
Burma Polo says hi Anthony my

braces and then retainers for 30 years

1327
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,140
duly noted understood

1328
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,040
it's not easy it's just not easy

1329
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:04,920
use this shot

1330
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,119
If You Smell Smoke from something

1331
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,000
burning

1332
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:11,160
and you do not know the Smoke's Origins

1333
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,660
or the purity of whatever is burning so

1334
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,640
here's how it works

1335
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,099
on planet Earth there's always something

1336
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,339
burning

1337
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:22,339
and it's not always just plain old wood

1338
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:29,280
for instance when they try to die out

1339
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:33,540
fires forest fires

1340
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,300
which they need to do they dump a powder

1341
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:38,700
on the forest fires that powders got

1342
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,559
metal in it and then it smolders up and

1343
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,160
burns right and then it goes in the

1344
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,160
atmosphere

1345
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,900
it's the point I'm trying to say is

1346
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,839
when people are burning fire pits

1347
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:55,520
they're burning plastic and garbage

1348
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,520
people just burn a lot of stuff

1349
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,200
the

1350
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,200
um

1351
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:07,260
the food industry

1352
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,119
Burns row covers that are plastic

1353
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,760
from you know for after they produce

1354
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,460
food each year

1355
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,680
say the Divine says what about metal

1356
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,180
plates from surgery we need to remove

1357
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,280
them yes

1358
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,960
I recommend not removing your metal

1359
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,640
plates from surgery unless your doctor

1360
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,319
wants to remove your metal plates for

1361
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,420
some reason for surge for after surgery

1362
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:29,160
or from surgery

1363
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,319
what I recommend and I've said this

1364
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,660
before if someone has nuts and bolts in

1365
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,520
them if they got titanium nuts and bolts

1366
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,960
holding their ankles together and

1367
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,240
they're and they're they're spying

1368
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,980
together and they got rods in their back

1369
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,140
keeping their back straight or they got

1370
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:46,800
a cage around their metal cage around

1371
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:48,599
their their disc their broken disc and

1372
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,579
whatever it is that they have metal or

1373
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,020
they got a plate in their head I only

1374
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:54,839
recommend

1375
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:57,359
right I only recommend

1376
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:59,579
exactly like the heavy metal detox

1377
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,380
smoothie and for family and friends or

1378
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:03,300
anybody that knows anybody that has any

1379
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,559
kind of metal in them from surgeries or

1380
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,660
procedures

1381
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,700
from car accidents to all kinds of

1382
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:11,220
injuries and they got metal inside of

1383
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:16,079
them like screws and nuts and bolts all

1384
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:18,540
of that I've always said that's fine

1385
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:19,859
it's it's just that's when the heavy

1386
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,240
metal detox movie is so great it's

1387
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:24,119
Gathering any metal that could be

1388
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,040
leaching that's the whole point

1389
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,619
but ask your doctor what's right for you

1390
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,660
you know

1391
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:32,819
take the book to your doctor but no I

1392
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,380
don't recommend like ever telling

1393
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,599
anybody hey you go take all your nuts

1394
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,160
and bolts out then why no you ask your

1395
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,020
doctor unless your doctor is doing that

1396
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,420
anyway that's another story that's

1397
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,400
whatever you and your doctor decide but

1398
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,319
I've always told doctors that I know

1399
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,420
that have asked this question

1400
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,099
and friends and stuff that have like a

1401
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,240
rod in their back or something from a

1402
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:53,579
bad injury

1403
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,980
or collapsed you know vertebrae or for

1404
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,559
some reason that that yeah heavy metal

1405
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:00,740
detox smoothie is great

1406
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,740
foreign

1407
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,119
we got some more stuff to read Nicholas

1408
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,359
Russell where else can you get this kind

1409
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:13,339
of info nowhere

1410
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,339
that's so true you can't get it anywhere

1411
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,980
and I'm not trying to boast I'm like you

1412
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,140

1413
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,780
I have to learn it too

1414
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:26,339
I just have to try to message it to you

1415
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,740
guys but I have to learn the information

1416
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:31,079
when SOC gives me the info I have to

1417
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,880
learn it all

1418
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,040
yeah

1419
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,299
and what if I wasn't even interested in

1420
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,299
anything in health

1421
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:43,260
I heard the voice growing up

1422
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,760

1423
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,799

00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,140
interested in any of this

1425
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:51,240
it's not even interesting to me like any

1426
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,819
of it like metals and

1427
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,619
neurons and heavy metal detects what if

1428

1432
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,420
I'm still forced to do it thanks to

1433
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:09,119

here's one toxic heavy metal exposures

1458
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:02,160
with you spend time in or near an area

1459
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,020
recently treated with pesticide

1460
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,760
herbicide or insecticide spray and

1461
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:09,020
fortunately

1462
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,780
they keep on releasing genetically

1463
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:14,760
engineered mosquitoes

1464
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:18,000
we wouldn't have a mosquito on this

1465
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:21,059
planet they're putting them here now

1466
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,220
they raise the mosquitoes

1467
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:26,220
trillions and trillions and trillions of

1468
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:28,619
mosquitoes and they release them into

1469
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:31,319
all environments on the planet that

1470
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:36,299
could house and harbor a mosquito

1471
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:40,319
and then they sell mosquito spray to the

1472
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:43,740
governments to spray on all the villages

1473
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:47,000
and towns and cities on this planet

1474
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:52,280
they create the problem by raising

1475
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:56,339
genetically engineered grown modified

1476
01:01:52,280 --> 01:02:00,440
mosquitoes and then they spray

1477
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:00,440
to try to keep them down

1478
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,040
where are we going today here's one

1479
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,040

um yeah there's there's definitely going

1496
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:53,579
to be a lot of metal exposure because

1497
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,740
fireworks are loaded with metal it's in

1498
01:02:53,579 --> 01:02:58,140
the air when you breathe in oh honey

1530
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,200
friend

1531
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:22,859

1532
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,480
let's get going on this

1533
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:27,000
okay you guys I got I'm getting I'm

1534
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,420

1535
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,119
right now for this okay

1536
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:36,859
all right half cup tightly packed fresh

1537
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,859
cilantro my favorite

1538
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:43,380
my favorite

1539
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:46,940
love cilantro but I love answering your

1540
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,940
questions though that's the whole point

1541
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,520
gonna have some cilantro go in here

1542
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,380
half cup tightly packed cilantro I've

1543
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,160
already measured this to some degree I

1544
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:07,920
have a great eye on this don't worry

1545
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,380
incredible

1546
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,839
a little bit more because if you tightly

1547
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,420
pack that that wouldn't have been much

1548
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:19,339
yeah

1549
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:19,339
let's put the cilantro in here

1550
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:22,579
big stem

1551
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:33,680
so what we're doing here is we are

1552
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:33,680
making the heavy metal exposure shop

1553
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,780
okay

1554
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:41,280
what's next

1555
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,839
third cup

1556
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,839
tightly packed arugula

1557
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,720
I just wanted to say these are sentences

1558
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:55,440
synergistically combined specifically

1559
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:57,839
the phytochemical compounds in this very

1560
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,660
blend of ingredients

1561
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:02,940
is what counts from Spirit of compassion

1562
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,740
that's why the brain shot therapies are

1563
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:07,380
mind-blowing and that's why people get

1564
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:08,640
results they're instant relief for so

1565
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:11,940
many people

1566
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,440
because it's how they're designed you no

1567
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,720
one would know to put any of this

1568
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,059
together to make these results happen

1569
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,339
for people you guys like

1570
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:24,180
people are having miraculous results you

1571
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:26,819
guys know and so it comes from above

1572
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:28,740
here we go

1573
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:31,200
if that was tightly packed really

1574
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:35,160
tightly packed that'd be like roughly

1575
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:39,980
around there those are small arugulas

1576
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,980
half cup wait a third cup

1577
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:45,599

the spirulina I'm using right the best

1644
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:25,020
one there is no question in my opinion

1645
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:26,880
by far I've talked about this so so many

1646
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:29,820
times over the years like the best

1647
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,960
spirulina there is is the Bemidji just

1648
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:33,179

right there

1651
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:40,620
by far the most incredible

1652
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,480
I have ever seen on the market

1653
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:44,640

1654
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,100
okay I just don't want to go into it

1655
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,600
because there's so much to talk about

1656
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:52,020
with this spirulina

1657
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:54,179

1658
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,980

1676
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:08,340
when you know you can do something about

1677
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,320
the exposure that we run into when you

1678
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:12,420
know you can do something about it when

1679
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,739
you actually can use your free will and

1680
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,739

01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:24,360
emotional comfort of what you went

1850
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:28,140
through in your life someone could go

1851
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:30,480
through so much emotional abuse in their

1852
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:34,020
lifetime when they were younger and they

1853
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:37,020
run to comfort Foods someone else

1854
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:39,300
could be living with someone who's had a

1855
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:42,480
lot happen in their life it's someone

1856
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:44,520
could be around food that they used to

1857
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,320
lean on as a comfort food and it's hard

1858
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,600
to stay on the wagon the point I'm

1859
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:52,020
trying to say is it's okay

1860
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:54,719
if you fall off the wagon and you can't

1861
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:56,760
get back on for now the addictions are

1862
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,040
strong out there I completely the

1863
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,140
chemicals and the MSG and the natural

1864
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,940
flavors and the addictions in the food

1865
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:04,679
that people didn't even know was there

1866
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:06,480
check out the medical meme podcast the

1867
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:08,400
natural flavors podcast please check

1868
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,560
that out if you get a chance the point

1869
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,239
I'm trying to say

1870
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,260
like Nicholas Russell said we've all

1871
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,480
been there

1872
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:19,320
absolutely

1873
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:24,420
and it's normal it's it's okay if we

1874
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:26,820
fall off the wagon it's okay it's okay

1875
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:29,640
you know because

1876
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:33,620
I don't know what it's like to be in

1877
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:37,320
your shoes you're falling off the wagon

1878
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:38,940
there's reasons there are reasons why

1879
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,760
that you might not even be able to

1880
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:44,219
identify there's reasons why

1881
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,679
I'm not in your shoes

1882
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:48,360

1883
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,159

1884
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,679
