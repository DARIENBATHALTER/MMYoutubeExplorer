[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 17.64] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 20.80] one of them. Whether you're dealing with
[17.64 - 25.04] anxiety, depression, endometriosis,
[20.80 - 28.00] acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,
[25.04 - 31.32] brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom
[28.00 - 34.48] or condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 45.92] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 48.40] Anthony William.
[45.92 - 51.44] We're talking about healing and spring
[48.40 - 54.56] can help with that. Spring has a lot to
[51.44 - 57.60] offer when you pay attention and you see
[54.56 - 60.12] it for what it's worth. When you feel it
[57.60 - 63.60] and you involve yourself in it in any
[60.12 - 66.24] capacity, spring can help you heal. It
[63.60 - 69.68] can ignite healing. And spring has
[66.24 - 72.48] profound rewiring effects. Spring has
[69.68 - 74.96] the power to inject metaphysical
[72.48 - 78.08] information into the emotional centers
[74.96 - 81.52] of the brain. Spring is a mental,
[78.08 - 84.00] emotional, and spiritual clearing tool.
[81.52 - 86.72] So, how do we go about using spring to
[84.00 - 88.16] help us heal? And just like the last two
[86.72 - 90.40] spring episodes that you might have
[88.16 - 92.88] heard already, we're on to the third.
[90.40 - 95.36] It's a medical medium spring series.
[92.88 - 98.96] Find yourself a comfortable place out
[95.36 - 103.60] there in a yard, in a park, in a field,
[98.96 - 103.60] on a porch, and let's do some spring
[104.12 - 110.28] healing. One of the things I love about
[106.52 - 114.00] spring is the noises, the
[110.28 - 116.64] sounds. Life is coming back. As of now,
[114.00 - 120.92] just sitting here, I hear woodpeckers. I
[116.64 - 123.56] hear various birds. I hear the wind
[120.92 - 126.36] blowing. I hear
[123.56 - 128.72] chirping. I hear dogs barking in the
[126.36 - 131.92] distance. Everybody's excited about
[128.72 - 134.24] spring. And what I'm noticing is, I hope
[131.92 - 138.80] the same thing you're noticing. I'm
[134.24 - 141.52] starting to feel it, hear it, sense it.
[138.80 - 144.56] As I'm in it, as I'm sitting in it right
[141.52 - 147.24] now, I'm sitting on the grass and I'm
[144.56 - 149.84] looking at everything. I'm looking at
[147.24 - 152.16] bushes, shrubs.
[149.84 - 154.32] I'm looking at brand new leaves. I'm
[152.16 - 157.20] looking at the grass that's coming out
[154.32 - 160.48] of the ground. It looks vibrant. Looks
[157.20 - 164.72] alive. It looks fresh. It doesn't look
[160.48 - 167.64] wasted and dehydrated. It looks plump.
[164.72 - 169.88] It looks vital. I'm looking at the
[167.64 - 172.84] breeze, how it's going through the
[169.88 - 176.00] trees, how it's moving leaves
[172.84 - 179.48] everywhere, brand new leaves, how it's
[176.00 - 183.36] moving the grass, the blades of
[179.48 - 186.84] grass. I just saw a bird that's flying
[183.36 - 190.32] in the wind. I see the wind carrying
[186.84 - 192.40] it. It had a stick in its mouth. It
[190.32 - 195.36] looks like it's going to make a nest.
[192.40 - 198.72] I'm becoming part of spring. on becoming
[195.36 - 200.96] one with it. And getting spring to heal
[198.72 - 203.52] you, to help you emotionally,
[200.96 - 205.92] spiritually, mentally, and physically.
[203.52 - 209.68] To help your body heal is to become one
[205.92 - 213.68] with it. It's to become part of it. It's
[209.68 - 216.16] to be a part of the spring in it. To use
[213.68 - 219.84] spring to heal, you have to see it,
[216.16 - 222.72] partake in it. You have to feel it. You
[219.84 - 225.04] have to smell it. You have to hear it.
[222.72 - 227.28] And if you can't get outside, that's
[225.04 - 230.08] okay because you can still sit inside
[227.28 - 232.88] the house, crack a window, and hear it
[230.08 - 235.16] from there. You can still smell the air
[232.88 - 237.68] as it enters in through a window or a
[235.16 - 240.32] doorway. You can still see the grass on
[237.68 - 243.04] the ground from a window. And it's still
[240.32 - 244.88] spring and you're still part of it. And
[243.04 - 246.96] that's the point. You just have to be
[244.88 - 249.04] part of it. Now, there's a lot of things
[246.96 - 252.56] you can do in the spring. You can set up
[249.04 - 254.16] a garden, start digging, planting seeds.
[252.56 - 256.48] Can take a walk on the beach if you're
[254.16 - 258.64] near one. Can take a walk by a lake if
[256.48 - 260.72] you're near one. You can take a walk
[258.64 - 262.72] down a path. You can go ride your
[260.72 - 264.48] bicycle. You can go on a trail in the
[262.72 - 267.12] woods. You could go and do a lot of
[264.48 - 269.36] things in the spring, but that's keeping
[267.12 - 271.12] busy. All those things have healing
[269.36 - 273.04] powers. All those things are good for
[271.12 - 274.96] the soul. And someday we'll go through
[273.04 - 277.76] each and every one of them. But right
[274.96 - 280.64] now, it's different. It's about not
[277.76 - 283.68] doing something. It's about not being
[280.64 - 286.16] busy. It's about instead seeing the
[283.68 - 288.84] spring and being a part of it, becoming
[286.16 - 292.56] it. And not just being busy doing
[288.84 - 295.20] something spring related, instead
[292.56 - 297.52] becoming spring for a moment. You can be
[295.20 - 300.72] busy in your garden. You can be digging
[297.52 - 302.60] holes and digging dirt, planting seeds.
[300.72 - 305.68] You can be focused on watering those
[302.60 - 307.72] seeds. But you're actively being busy.
[305.68 - 309.76] It's powerful. It's
[307.72 - 312.16] healing. But we're talking about
[309.76 - 315.36] becoming one with spring. Shutting
[312.16 - 319.04] things down for a moment. Sitting there
[315.36 - 321.44] listening, smelling the air, focused on
[319.04 - 323.76] the little things about spring that are
[321.44 - 327.52] really huge and they're actually big
[323.76 - 329.96] things. By not being actively busy while
[327.52 - 332.24] you're sitting there and taking in the
[329.96 - 336.04] spring, you're allowing something to
[332.24 - 338.72] happen, a release. You're allowing
[336.04 - 341.52] emotions to surface because you're not
[338.72 - 344.40] pushing them down. You're not doing
[341.52 - 347.68] something to push them down. You're not
[344.40 - 350.24] doing something to keep so busy that you
[347.68 - 353.20] can't feel those emotions and that
[350.24 - 356.20] everything stays suppressed, stays
[353.20 - 359.36] depressed. You're allowing an avenue to
[356.20 - 362.48] open. You're allowing things to surface
[359.36 - 367.16] and sit there so they can leave. You're
[362.48 - 371.80] allowing the toxic emotions, hardships,
[367.16 - 373.64] experiences, the imprints to surface,
[371.80 - 377.48] leave, and
[373.64 - 380.20] dissipate to get grown over and mulched
[377.48 - 383.04] up. When you're sitting there with the
[380.20 - 386.48] spring and you're just listening and
[383.04 - 389.12] smelling the air and sensing everything
[386.48 - 391.52] and seeing everything, you're not trying
[389.12 - 394.32] to stuff anything down.
[391.52 - 398.96] You're not trying to push anything down.
[394.32 - 402.84] Fear and guilt and shame can surface and
[398.96 - 404.84] then leave. It can fly away like a
[402.84 - 407.08] butterfly. A
[404.84 - 409.40] butterfly can hedge your
[407.08 - 412.00] way. And as it's
[409.40 - 415.84] leaving, so can your fear, guilt, and
[412.00 - 418.28] shame, or anything else that's bothering
[415.84 - 420.80] you, anything toxic that's inside of
[418.28 - 424.16] you, any kind of pain and suffering on
[420.80 - 427.92] an emotional level, any kind of PTSD,
[424.16 - 429.48] see it lift off of you. See it leave you
[427.92 - 431.48] as you're sitting there
[429.48 - 435.52] still. See a
[431.48 - 437.56] butterfly take it away as it flies by.
[435.52 - 440.32] Springtime is the great
[437.56 - 442.48] absorber. It absorbs everything.
[440.32 - 445.84] Everything you see around you is
[442.48 - 448.80] thriving. It's hungry. It's thirsty. The
[445.84 - 452.08] grass is not going dormant. It's not
[448.80 - 455.28] dying. Instead, it's thriving and it's
[452.08 - 457.80] thirsty. Hungry and it's growing. See
[455.28 - 461.76] your body like the grass. It's not
[457.80 - 464.80] dormant. It's not dying. It's thriving.
[461.76 - 467.84] It's hungry. It's thirsty.
[464.80 - 470.88] It wants to live. All the leftovers from
[467.84 - 473.96] the year, from the winter, from the fall
[470.88 - 476.32] are being utilized. Nothing is being
[473.96 - 480.24] wasted. You have to see your body like
[476.32 - 482.64] that. All toxins, all toxic emotions,
[480.24 - 485.12] old imprints, old wounds are being
[482.64 - 488.48] absorbed. Your body's hungry like the
[485.12 - 491.12] spring. It's hungry like the grass and
[488.48 - 493.88] the bushes and the shrubs and the birds
[491.12 - 496.92] and the butterflies. It eats up all the
[493.88 - 499.44] waste. It utilizes
[496.92 - 503.48] everything. As you're sitting there with
[499.44 - 507.20] spring around you, it's bursting. It's
[503.48 - 509.76] alive. It's growing over everything that
[507.20 - 512.56] was old. Just like the old grass and the
[509.76 - 515.36] old leaves and the old sticks and the
[512.56 - 517.76] old herbs are being grown over.
[515.36 - 520.36] Everything from last year is one step
[517.76 - 523.04] closer from being absorbed,
[520.36 - 525.36] disappearing, dissipating. As you're
[523.04 - 528.08] sitting there, think about how spring
[525.36 - 530.80] can do this. And think about how spring
[528.08 - 534.40] can do this for you. Toxic emotions,
[530.80 - 537.12] spiritual confusion, losses, hardships,
[534.40 - 540.80] any kind of letdowns, betrayal, trust
[537.12 - 543.28] wounds, spring is absorbing them a
[540.80 - 546.04] little bit at a time, bit by bit. Every
[543.28 - 549.20] single bird chirp, every part of a
[546.04 - 552.96] breeze, every squirrel that moves, every
[549.20 - 556.40] leaf that rustles in the wind, every bee
[552.96 - 558.56] that wakes up and zips by, every
[556.40 - 561.12] caterpillar that's walking. There are
[558.56 - 564.16] sounds everywhere. Some sounds you can
[561.12 - 565.92] hear and some sounds you can't hear. And
[564.16 - 567.76] even if you can't hear the sound, it
[565.92 - 570.16] doesn't mean it's not working for you.
[567.76 - 573.12] There is life happening underground.
[570.16 - 575.88] There are moles moving. There are
[573.12 - 578.80] woodchucks and groundhogs. There are
[575.88 - 582.08] earthworms crawling underneath the soil.
[578.80 - 584.24] There are bunny rabbits nestled down in
[582.08 - 587.84] their nest. There are peepers in the
[584.24 - 590.48] trees. There's toads and frogs in the
[587.84 - 594.64] grass. And there's hawks flying high in
[590.48 - 597.52] the sky and owls in the trees. All of
[594.64 - 599.36] this is awakening and moving around you
[597.52 - 602.08] while you're sitting there. And the
[599.36 - 603.96] spring is attaching to the old emotions
[602.08 - 608.56] that were stuck all winter inside of
[603.96 - 611.12] you, to toxic injuries and wounds that
[608.56 - 613.60] have resided inside of you. The spring
[611.12 - 615.88] is consuming it all. Now, if you get a
[613.60 - 619.60] moment, take a deep
[615.88 - 622.32] breath. Can you smell the air? Do you
[619.60 - 624.64] smell any wild flowers? In the spring,
[622.32 - 627.36] there are small wild flowers popping out
[624.64 - 629.28] everywhere. With your eyes closed, what
[627.36 - 632.04] do you hear?
[629.28 - 634.28] Are you honing in on any
[632.04 - 639.08] birds, any spring
[634.28 - 639.08] sounds, any leaves rustling.
[649.60 - 654.28] Every sound that you hear produced by
[652.56 - 657.88] spring is
[654.28 - 660.88] healing physically, emotionally,
[657.88 - 660.88] spiritually,
[662.60 - 667.56] mentally. Thoughts don't own you. Spring
[666.24 - 671.20] is in
[667.56 - 673.00] control. Spring is connected to you.
[671.20 - 676.40] You're becoming one with
[673.00 - 679.40] spring. The healing is occurring right
[676.40 - 679.40] now.
[686.88 - 691.28] When you devote your time and energy
[688.56 - 694.16] into spring, spring sees you and hears
[691.28 - 695.64] you. The earthly mother spring hears
[694.16 - 698.00] your
[695.64 - 700.08] heartbeat. Here's the blood coursing
[698.00 - 703.36] through your veins and arteries. Here's
[700.08 - 706.48] your stomach gurgle and your digestion
[703.36 - 711.28] process functioning. your eyelids
[706.48 - 711.28] blinking and even your sinus cavities
[714.36 - 718.00] moving. Take a deep
[719.88 - 725.96] breath. And as you release that breath,
[723.28 - 729.20] think about you being connected to
[725.96 - 733.48] spring. Spring being connected to you
[729.20 - 733.48] and all the healing that's occurring.
[741.76 - 747.12] Now you can repeat this exercise anytime
[744.48 - 750.24] out here in spring, out here in your
[747.12 - 753.52] yard, out here in the park, on a grassy
[750.24 - 756.00] null, on a hill, on your porch or inside
[753.52 - 758.08] your house even. Keep in mind there's
[756.00 - 760.24] different levels of spring, different
[758.08 - 762.88] phases of spring, different time
[760.24 - 764.64] periods. There's really early spring,
[762.88 - 766.72] there's mid-spring, there's later
[764.64 - 769.44] spring, and many different phases of
[766.72 - 771.92] spring in between those three phases.
[769.44 - 774.40] Look out for the wild flowers. Take a
[771.92 - 776.16] close look at them when you see them.
[774.40 - 779.12] Look out for the first butterflies of
[776.16 - 782.72] the season. They happen in the spring,
[779.12 - 785.68] late spring. And look out for the bees
[782.72 - 787.60] and the bumblebees, the honeybees. Stare
[785.68 - 789.84] at them while they're on the flowers.
[787.60 - 792.16] Keep in mind that spring changes by the
[789.84 - 794.08] hour. It changes by the day and by the
[792.16 - 795.92] week. The sounds are going to be
[794.08 - 797.60] different. The smells are going to be
[795.92 - 798.52] different. But there's one thing that's
[797.60 - 802.20] not
[798.52 - 804.32] different. It's spring always ignites
[802.20 - 806.08] healing. Always helps us heal
[804.32 - 808.88] emotionally, spiritually, physically,
[806.08 - 811.40] and mentally. When you get a chance, you
[808.88 - 815.36] can listen to all three of these spring
[811.40 - 815.36] episodes and repeat them
[815.40 - 819.08] anytime. For more free information, you
[818.08 - 821.00] can go to
[819.08 - 825.16] medicalmemedium.com. And please take
[821.00 - 830.12] care. Many blessings and God bless
[825.16 - 833.04] you. It's spring. Yes, it is. It's
[830.12 - 837.16] spring. Did you hear that? There's a
[833.04 - 841.60] bird about to sing. A bee, a wild
[837.16 - 843.80] flower. It's changing by the hour. A
[841.60 - 846.32] butterfly just floated
[843.80 - 847.64] by. Dear God.
[846.32 - 851.32] Dear
[847.64 - 855.12] God, do you think spring's
[851.32 - 857.36] holy? What would you say to someone who
[855.12 - 860.68] thought spring was in their way and
[857.36 - 865.44] thought spring created nothing but bad
[860.68 - 869.44] days? As I stand here on the lawn, I
[865.44 - 873.04] feel like something's under my feet. I
[869.44 - 876.88] think it was a molly. Oh, mole. Oh, mole
[873.04 - 880.48] down in the earth. It's springtime. Time
[876.88 - 883.20] to rebirth. The ground seems sound. All
[880.48 - 886.40] the birds are all around. Oh god. Oh
[883.20 - 888.84] god. Do the angels treasure spring? Or
[886.40 - 891.16] is it something that doesn't mean
[888.84 - 893.52] anything? And where are the
[891.16 - 896.08] grasshoppers? Oh, that's right. It's
[893.52 - 898.48] spring, not late summer when the
[896.08 - 901.52] lightning bugs come out at night and
[898.48 - 905.28] shine so bright. And the grasshoppers
[901.52 - 908.56] hop all day, hop around. all happy
[905.28 - 910.88] because spring was their birthday. When
[908.56 - 913.92] you involve yourself in spring and take
[910.88 - 918.48] it all in, a lot of healing can happen
[913.92 - 921.44] deep within. Angels, angels from above.
[918.48 - 924.56] Do you soar on the wind? Do you help a
[921.44 - 929.32] spring animal when you can? Do you help
[924.56 - 932.28] a possum, a raccoon, a bobcat, a fox, a
[929.32 - 935.28] turtle, a bunny? When they get in
[932.28 - 938.00] trouble, do you help them? And when you
[935.28 - 942.12] do, do they think it's funny? When
[938.00 - 947.56] spring rain comes our way, the
[942.12 - 947.56] sunshine comes on another day.
[973.40 - 977.76] Original published medical medium
[975.60 - 980.32] information gets stolen and poached by
[977.76 - 982.24] podcast doctors, social media doctors,
[980.32 - 984.00] influencers, and medical clinics.
[982.24 - 985.84] Medical medium information has never yet
[984.00 - 987.84] been proven wrong by medical science and
[985.84 - 989.52] research. Instead, the opposite only
[987.84 - 991.36] proven right and then taken from medical
[989.52 - 993.12] medium published material and used in
[991.36 - 995.12] the conventional and alternative health
[993.12 - 997.12] communities. Medical Medium information
[995.12 - 998.64] continually sets the stage for medical
[997.12 - 1000.64] science to understand chronic illness
[998.64 - 1002.56] better. If you choose to share or use
[1000.64 - 1004.56] the original unique content from the
[1002.56 - 1006.80] medical medium podcast, books, or
[1004.56 - 1008.40] medical medium social media, please site
[1006.80 - 1009.76] where this information comes from so
[1008.40 - 1011.28] others who see and learn of this
[1009.76 - 1012.80] information have a chance to know where
[1011.28 - 1014.56] it all originates to give them an
[1012.80 - 1016.32] opportunity to heal so they don't end up
[1014.56 - 1018.32] losing years of their life searching for
[1016.32 - 1020.16] answers like so many have before them.
[1018.32 - 1022.16] The medical medium information here on
[1020.16 - 1024.00] this podcast doesn't come from broken
[1022.16 - 1026.08] science, interest groups, medical
[1024.00 - 1028.72] funding with strings attached, botched
[1026.08 - 1030.88] research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,
[1028.72 - 1032.96] persuaded belief systems, private panels
[1030.88 - 1034.64] of influencers, health field payoffs,
[1032.96 - 1036.48] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1034.64 - 1038.40] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1036.48 - 1040.32] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1038.40 - 1042.16] before in our modern-day history, it
[1040.32 - 1044.00] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1042.16 - 1045.76] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1044.00 - 1047.44] Medical medium information has street
[1045.76 - 1048.64] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1047.44 - 1050.40] countless people around the world
[1048.64 - 1052.24] healing more healing stories of real
[1050.40 - 1054.32] people not being paid to tell their
[1052.24 - 1056.00] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1054.32 - 1058.08] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1056.00 - 1059.68] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1058.08 - 1061.28] their lives back and finally healing
[1059.68 - 1062.72] when nothing else in the world of health
[1061.28 - 1064.72] could move the needle and get them
[1062.72 - 1067.12] better. The information on this podcast
[1064.72 - 1068.96] is not man-made. It comes from above,
[1067.12 - 1070.88] from a higher source. Whatever you
[1068.96 - 1072.80] believe in, whether God, the universe,
[1070.88 - 1074.16] the light, or the creator, or if you
[1072.80 - 1075.44] believe in nothing at all, that we're
[1074.16 - 1077.20] just floating through space together on
[1075.44 - 1078.96] this rock, know that the information you
[1077.20 - 1080.72] hear on this podcast is separate from
[1078.96 - 1082.40] all the other noise out there. It comes
[1080.72 - 1084.88] from a different place. A pure
[1082.40 - 1087.92] untampered with advanced clean
[1084.88 - 1092.24] uncorrupted original primary source. A
[1087.92 - 1092.24] higher source, spirit of compassion.
