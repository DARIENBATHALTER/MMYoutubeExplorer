see we might be able to pull it off the

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,640
real causes of this chronic skin

53
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,880
condition and it's all still largely

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,960
unknown in medical community ities in

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
fact what's really funny you look into

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,560
it and you'll see it is unknown so so

first time you know with the show and

78
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,200
everything else started at the age four

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,879
heard a voice perfectly clear just like

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,840
someone standing in the room it's

81
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,080
different it's not like channeling it's

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,280
not like that kind of thing this is like

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,640
you hearing your friend talk in real

84
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,159
time in your ear so that's how it works

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,840
and because of that it's been this thing

86
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
where I can get the information for

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,720
people no matter what I'm doing doesn't

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
matter if I'm tired exhausted doesn't

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,840
matter if I'm run down doesn't matter if

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,000
I you know if if I'm upset or if I'm sad

91
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,760
about something spirit will provide the

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,080
information at all times nonstop no

93
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,959
matter who's around me what's going on

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,720
and because of that that medical

95
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,319
information that's ahead of ahead of

96
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,319
medical research and medical Sciences

97
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,120
time I've been able to give that

98
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,360
information since a child to people I've

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,599
dedicated my entire life doing this

100
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,000
literally doing this and only this my

101
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,480
entire life and so that's a little bit

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
about me I've helped tens of thousands

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,879
of people heal find the information they

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,560
need like we're doing on this show so

105
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,079
let's go let's go into the eimos

106
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,720
psoriasis let's start talking about that

107
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,040
right now because I know we have to get

108
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,159
this done um so if we're going to talk

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
about Xmen psoriasis though I have to

110
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,879
tell you something first of all fasten

111
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,319
your seat bels get ready for this

112
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,880
because I'm releasing some serious

113
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,519
information in this show this is really

114
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,720
serious if we're going to talk about

115
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,440
Xmen psoriasis then we have to clear the

116
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,040
air about the great auto immune mistake

117
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,800
once again I talked about it recently

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,639
you guys know okay the reason why I have

119
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,639
to talk about this is because aom and

120
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,080
psoriasis are they're classified and

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
listed as

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,440
autoimmune which medical communities

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,160
believe it's your body attacking itself

124
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,759
so Medical Research Medical Science

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,280
believes your body's attacking itself

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,160
autoimmunity so you know look if I went

127
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,840
to the doctor because of a rash on my

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,639
arm that was chronic and I was diagnosed

129
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,160
with eczema or

130
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,919
psoriasis and was told my body was

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,000
attacking itself I would leave the

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,960
office to feed it I really would now if

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,199
that was the truth if that's just really

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,639
how it worked then okay fine I at least

135
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,720
it's the truth but it's not the truth I

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,240
I it's not and I can prove it in many

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,960
ways including helping people heal in

138
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,560
all the years I put into it including

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,600
the information I have that's Advanced

140
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,720
you'll see you just hang in there we're

141
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,319
going to learn about it all um you know

142
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,000
if I drove home from that doctor's

143
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,280
office of course I would feel let down

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,199
defeated your body does not attack

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,800
itself and the fact that I have to bring

146
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,120
this great mistake up of autoimmune

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,560
multiple times with almost every illness

148
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,960
I have to cover shows me how many of us

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,319
have been let down misled been given

150
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,120
misinformation and truly this is really

151
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,520
that serious and how serious this really

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,000
is I mean think about it and there's

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,440
very little known about what causes

154
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,880
eczema for example so think about it if

155
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,560
you even look up what causes eczema it

156
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,120
it's unknown so how is it even possible

157
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,440
to blame your body and say it's

158
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,280
attacking itself destroying your skin

159
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,759
that your tea cells are destroying the

160
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,960
skin when it's unknown as to anything

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,360
about the disease or illness or

162
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,680
condition whatsoever in medical research

163
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,360
and medical science think about that one

164
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,919
think about that is that unbelievable

165
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,880
just kind of think about that for a

166
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,520
couple of minutes exactly so when you

167
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,160
know someone says to me what does the

168
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
big medical medium know about you know

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,880
Medical Research Medical Science I'll

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,599
tell you I have the answers from spirit

171
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,000
thank God and I've been able to help

172
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,319
people thank God and it's that important

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,720
because what's the what's the opposite

174
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,080
what's the lad the lad is unknown

175
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,120
meaning cause of illness and disease

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,400
unknown and we're going to blame it on

177
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,479
you that's the latter what what's the

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,960
difference there you want to go that way

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
so when someone challenges you or

180
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,840
challenges you on what you're doing to

181
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,080
take care of yourself and all the good

182
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,360
stuff you're doing for yourself they

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,840
challenge you what are you going to are

184
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,039
you going to say okay so I'm supposed to

185
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,280
do the latter it's unknown and my body's

186
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,400
attacking him itself and that's it so

187
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,599
that's what you're supposed to do I mean

188
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,400
come on so we we have to we have to come

189
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,440
we have to be just honest we have to be

190
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,800
honest we have to be clear there has to

191
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,360
be Clarity there has to be understanding

192
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,879
there has to be compassion with this

193
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,879
there has to be all of this so there's

194
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,000
very little Unknown about what causes

195
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,000
azema for example in the in the world of

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,360
medicine it's thought that your genes

197
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,479
once again are fouled up or all miss

198
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,680
combobulated or bumbled okay like your

199
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,319
jeans are all messed up so that's

200
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,599
actually the other option they have they

201
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,000
think it could be your jeans listen

202
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,280
that's one of the other great mistakes

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,840
that I covered recently and and before

204
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,440
you can't think it's your jeans whatever

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,879
you do you think it's your jeans you're

206
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,000
just going to get in trouble because

207
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,319
it'll break down your immune system it

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,599
will break down your immune system and

209
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,720
and one of these days we're going to

210
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
cover the whole methylation issue the

211
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,560
MTHFR gene mutation which is actually

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,680
going by storm raging through all the

213
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,960
alternative doctor's offices right now

214
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,280
and even conventional and functional

215
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,000
that is a confusion now yes there is a

216
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,319
methylation problem that we have out

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,759
there but the gene mutation test is not

218
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,560
what it's cracked up to be I'm going to

219
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,520
have to expose that to help everybody

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
out so we can move move forward that's a

221
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,080
whole another thing it's about the genes

222
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,080
anyway so you know basically another

223
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,519
thing that the medical communities think

224
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,919
that causes exmos orasis is

225
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,640
allergies some kind of allergy to

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,120
something I mean come on talking about

227
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,040
throwing darts at a barn that I mean

228
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,680
really um same with psoriasis it causes

229
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,120
unknown um it's either your genes or

230
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,200
it's your white blood count your te-

231
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,680
cells that are attacking your

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,360
skin yeah nice Theory nice Theory look

233
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,399
I'm sarcastic I am I have to admit I'm a

234
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,320
little more sarcastic today because I'll

235
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,880
tell you why I'll tell you why we'll

236
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,480
talk about why I'm sarcastic it's it's

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,399
coming up look this is once again Theory

238
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,480
no real answers and the best it gets in

239
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,480
medical research and medical science is

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,800
cause unknown so let's blame you and

241
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,360
your body that's why I'm sarcastic about

242
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,720
it because it's being you're being

243
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,120
blamed so let's blame your genan once

244
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,360
again that's why I'm sarcastic because

245
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,399
you're being blamed think about that

246
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,040
today is the day we air out the

247
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,399
truth about psoriasis and eczema and

248
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,519
also we will try to cover some AC acne

249
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,360
today cystic acne if we can so I know

250
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,959
the you know if you're suffering from

251
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,720
that we're going to do our best as far

252
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,200
as eczema and psoriasis goes it's a

253
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,320
whole different level of suffering if

254
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,600
you are a loved one or friend is dealing

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,839
with it you know different illnesses and

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,720
symptoms of conditions people who have

257
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,160
created who people who have been dealing

258
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,880
with suffering at different times and

259
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
levels in different ways exen psoriasis

260
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
is a different

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,279
ballpark so we all suffer from these

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,640
different illnesses out there we we you

263
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,160
know different diagnoses conditions

264
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,760
symptoms but examen orasis creates a

265
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,279
suffering that sometimes just can't be

266
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,079
matched and and this is why I have a

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,959
snarkiness about me and and some sarcasm

268
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,120
about everything because I've seen the

269
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,240
suffering I've seen it for years I've

270
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
seen it for decades if you've had eczema

271
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,959
and it's been pretty bad or flared up if

272
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,079
you've had um psoriasis you know what

273
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm talking about the itchiness is

274
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,560
unlike any other the pain on the skin

275
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,880
unlike any other the burning the

276
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,120
swelling in many cases bleeding is

277
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,040
unlike any other okay that we've dealt

278
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,680
with or deal with you know think of the

279
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,040
worst case of poison Ivy but then

280
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,519
imagine it being

281
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,560
chronic you know so this is this is a

282
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,760
piece of it this is a piece of the deal

283
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
of of why I get kind of snarky of why I

284
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,200
seem like I have an attitude at some

285
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,680
times because you know it I've seen the

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,360
suffering I know what it is I know it's

287
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,600
what it's about and I've had to help

288
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,440
people recover and you know when when

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,480
when the answer out there is only cause

290
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,959
unknown it's your genes or maybe an

291
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,079
allergy and your body's attacking itself

292
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,399
and that's all we're given it's not

293
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,720
enough it's just not and you know fine

294
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,920
fine if it we can't blame anybody if

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,360
that cause is unknown but we better at

296
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,800
least be honest and get out of denial

297
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,320
medical denial that that it's you know

298
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,279
that they don't have the answer so we're

299
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,360
blaming you that has to be fixed it has

300
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,880
to be we have to say look we don't know

301
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,120
what causes all this but we have to stop

302
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,240
blaming the person we have to because it

303
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,800
breaks down their immune system that's

304
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,399
what we just talked about in the last

305
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,200
immune system show is we talked about

306
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,399
that very thing breaking down the immune

307
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,800
system with this this

308
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:20,240
misinformation so um there are different

309
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,519
levels of psoriasis and eczema you know

310
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,000
mild rash crack cracking in the skin

311
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,360
different levels of itching different

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,720
levels of bleeding to mild and to

313
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:35,399
releasees s um so and the thing is is

314
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,320
one of the things we have to understand

315
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,680
this is important this is an important

316
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,560
note there are hundreds of varieties

317
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,440
meaning it's not just always the same

318
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,120
it's not just different levels there's

319
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:52,480
different varieties of examon psoriasis

320
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,639
different different shapes different

321
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,279
sizes different patterns different

322
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,880
different way it's laid out on the body

323
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,920
different levels of of um you know some

324
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,240
even if some is some eczema or some

325
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,160
psoriasis is really extreme it may not

326
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,480
bleed some does you know it's so many

327
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,639
different varieties it's not just like

328
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,600
oh that's eczema you know that's an

329
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,920
umbrella word for a 100 varieties of

330
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,079
eczema I'm not exaggerating on that by

331
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,440
the way I'm not 100 varieties of eczema

332
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:28,440
I am not exaggerating that is serious I

333
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,440
mean that's how many different varieties

334
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,800
there are as far as with exim alone and

335
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,120
psoriasis it's not just pla psoriasis

336
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,920
and and serotic arthritis you know and

337
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,399
different psor that involves with um

338
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,639
arthritis and non- arthritis and

339
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,600
everything else and not even just that

340
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:47,440
there's there's not those two varieties

341
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,720
or three varieties we're talking there

342
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,320
is over a 100 with psoriasis

343
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,120
2 that's how many so we have to kind of

344
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
do we just we just have to be open to

345
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,440
this and to know this we can't just bury

346
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,440
it and hide it like it doesn't exist now

347
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,720
the reason why it's not talked about so

348
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,279
much is because it'll confuse the bear

349
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
it'll confuse everybody and they'll be

350
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,720
like well what is it there 100

351
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,880
medications then how come there's not

352
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,720
100 medications for 100 different

353
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,199
eczemas the reason why it's the only

354
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,920
medication for eczema is an

355
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,480
immunosuppressive or a steroid so they

356
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,920
no one cares in the Medical Science and

357
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,839
medical research world no one really

358
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,959
cares to identify different kinds the

359
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,639
different shapes different sizes all the

360
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,480
different varieties because they're just

361
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,680
going to give a steroid out anyway or an

362
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,800
IM immunosuppressive uh drug they're

363
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,440
just going to hand something out and

364
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,880
sure you know these things can Aid at

365
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
different times when we're we're in

366
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,240
crisis when we don't know how to deal

367
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,320
with it when we don't know how to handle

368
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,279
it and we don't know what we need to do

369
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,120
for it of course you know the we we

370
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,639
could use these things at different

371
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
times in our life and I've seen them

372
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,959
help people when they couldn't be helped

373
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
because they weren't they weren't given

374
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,240
the information they weren't given what

375
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,240
they were supposed to do but the reason

376
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,480
why a 100 varieties is not

377
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,480
identified is because that very reason

378
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,519
is because they don't have anything to

379
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,959
offer it's just one drug or two drugs

380
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,800
and that's it so why go crazy and trying

381
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,399
to really look into this with research

382
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and Science and fund and funding and

383
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,440
getting a lot of immunologist on board

384
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,959
and figuring things out it's just it's

385
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,480
just not worth it for the industry so um

386
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:39,600
but it's worth it to get the answers and

387
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,360
to get us in a better place so let's get

388
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,199
down to the truth you know fasten your

389
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,360
seat belts I'm with you on this ride and

390
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,680
we're going to get down to it so if you

391
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,319
just logged on we're going into it right

392
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,639
now and if you just logged on you got to

393
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,600
go back and and to the archive and hear

394
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:03,600
the beginning of the show you have to so

395
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,360
the real cause and the foundation to it

396
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,680
all ecam and psoriasis stems from the

397
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,680
liver but it's more than just the liver

398
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,319
and I'm going to explain so we have to

399
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
kind of have our thinking caps on

400
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:19,079
because this is going to get a little

401
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,720
bit more complexed um spirit's

402
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,600
information can can do that I try to I

403
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,839
try to deliver spirit's information in

404
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,720
the best way I can um to try you know

405
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,279
try to over complicate something so we

406
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,399
have to hang on for this one that's what

407
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,440
I mean by fasten your seat belt so the

408
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:40,399
truth is it stems from the liver that's

409
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,240
where the cause or that's where it all

410
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:48,440
begins it's a liver condition the reason

411
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,000
this is not on the radar of medical

412
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,040
research and medical science is because

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,600
it's not a liver disease okay so you

414
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,360
have to understand how Medical Research

415
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,079
Medical Science Works um if it's not a

416
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,280
liver disease that's easily detected

417
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,120
with what they use already and not

418
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,079
creating something to detect what's

419
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,600
really happening then it's not on the

420
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:18,319
radar but it's a it's a liver issue it

421
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,199
stems from the liver that's what causes

422
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,679
this condition but we're going to go

423
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,880
into it deeper it's more than that okay

424
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,960
and and what happens is when you know

425
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,400
the doctor tests your liver function he

426
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,799
sees it's normal that doesn't mean there

427
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,799
isn't a problem when they're checking

428
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,640
for like liver enzymes cuz that really

429
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,600
doesn't play that much of a role into

430
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,440
psorasis or EXA until things have gotten

431
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,520
too bad and I'm going to tell you what

432
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,880
plays the most role what plays the

433
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,200
biggest this biggest part of it so like

434
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,760
I said if the doctor finds you know

435
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,720
liver enzyme and the function is going

436
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,919
good it's not going to be enough to

437
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,600
uncover the deeper more complicated

438
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:03,159
issues regarding the liver that creates

439
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,600
eczema and psoriasis or both or one of

440
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:10,400
them I've seen people with both so what

441
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,880
is wrong with the liver of someone who

442
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,960
is dealing with eczema and

443
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,120
psoriasis what is

444
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,559
wrong well it's a specific group of

445
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,080
toxins that are not known to

446
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:27,600
Conventional or alternative medicine and

447
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,840
will not be singled out for at least

448
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,679
another 30 years or

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,440
more but everyone

450
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:38,320
here I'm sure doesn't have the 30 years

451
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,400
to wait for even the discovery so we're

452
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,880
going to learn about this today right

453
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,520
now this specific group of toxins is

454
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,880
called a dermatoxin that's what it's

455
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,039
called a dermatoxin that's what they're

456
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,640
going to call it down the road

457
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,720
dermatoxin now you know that a

458
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:04,120
dermatoxin is a toxin that surfaces only

459
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,880
to the skin and injures the Derma the

460
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,840
Deep Derma tissue okay that's what the

461
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,440
dermatoxin is I've talked about

462
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,840
neurotoxins a lot neurotoxins come from

463
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,679
viruses such as Epstein bar virus or

464
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,840
shingles or hhb6 or ceglar virus and

465
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:24,919
others neurotoxins inflame and affect

466
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,120
the nervous system in the body causing

467
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:33,280
fatigue anxiety depression pain tingles

468
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,000
and numbness burning Etc okay that's a

469
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,559
neurotoxin so that's different so I want

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,799
you to know that so you know spirit's an

471
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,640
expert at neurotoxins and has been

472
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,559
talking about neurotoxins long before

473
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,400
they were talked about I remember being

474
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,320
10 years old and telling someone they

475
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,280
had neurotoxins from Spirit neurotoxins

476
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,480
that was like basically an alien ship

477
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,760
Landing because never mind 30 years ago

478
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,280
telling somebody that they're allergic

479
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,320
to weed

480
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,039
that was like an alien ship Landing okay

481
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,440
because meaning talking about blowing

482
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,840
somebody's mind out 30 35 years ago or

483
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,679
more and so um so just imagine saying

484
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,799
neurotoxin out of a 10-year-old and

485
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,440
that's that's what I'm saying it's it's

486
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,159
but dermat toxins this is a whole

487
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,880
another game now I'm releasing this

488
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,200
first time here today and you know I

489
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
thought about it and I said you know

490
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,240
everybody just needs to know so the

491
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,840
dermato toxins go to the skin it's

492
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,600
different than the

493
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,320
neurotoxin so I talked about the

494
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,919
neurotoxin for a second I have to go

495
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,679
back to that a little bit just so you

496
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,440
know there's a difference the

497
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:44,159
neurotoxin is a virus that's eating a

498
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,280
specific food it likes it could and or a

499
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,960
specific type of metal like for instance

500
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:54,240
if a virus like Epstein bar um feeds off

501
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,120
of mercury it goes to bathroom releases

502
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,080
a neurotoxin it's like a methyl

503
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,559
neurotoxin and that neurotoxin causes

504
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,039
all kinds of tingles and numbness it

505
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:05,000
causes all kinds of other stuff

506
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,760
depression anxiety it inflames the

507
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,679
nerves causes

508
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,440
vertigo you name it and that's what it

509
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,520
does okay so that's a neurotoxin so

510
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,320
dermato toxins are different they go to

511
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,640
the skin they don't go to the nervous

512
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,919
system so deep underneath the skin in

513
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,320
the Derma at the bottom base basically

514
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,840
it starts there's it's like a dermatoxin

515
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,120
acts as a

516
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Venom and these toxins are highly

517
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,919
inflammatory the skin tries to release

518
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,640
the Toxin and may crack and bleed in the

519
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,039
event that it's trying to do this it's

520
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,640
trying to eliminate the Toxin and that

521
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,360
even hurts even more okay that's how it

522
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,799
works the neurotoxin is created by a

523
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,480
virus like I told you that you know

524
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,039
epine bar that eliminates the poison

525
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,640
it's neurotoxic a

526
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:04,400
dermatoxin is also created by a

527
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,440
pathogen but here's the difference so

528
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,159
understand this so we have the liver

529
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,720
remember when I said that I said the

530
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,360
liver is where it all stems

531
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:18,840
from okay well the liver has a pathogen

532
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,120
in it it doesn't have to be a specific

533
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,400
pathogen that's what's interesting about

534
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,039
this with psoriasis and um eczema so a

535
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,679
pathogen sits in the

536
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,720
liver and it's a

537
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,080
and it creates a

538
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,000
dermatoxin by consuming

539
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,720
copper you got to understand that by

540
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,120
consuming

541
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:48,240
copper that's how examen psoriasis is

542
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:51,360
created it's from a bug consuming and

543
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,760
eliminating copper you won't find that

544
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,600
on the internet you just won't find that

545
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,039
there and you won't find a lot of things

546
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,760
that that I've discovered on and off

547
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,640
over the years to with Spirit through

548
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,880
spirit and this one here you're not

549
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:08,240
going to find there either and but this

550
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,799
is the real root cause I mean this is

551
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,120
exactly the root cause it's a pathogen

552
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,400
that is consuming copper wait till you

553
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,320
hear this in the

554
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
liver

555
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:25,400
okay and that

556
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,880
copper is also in the liver due to

557
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,279
pesticides and herbicide exposure

558
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,640
that are not

559
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:38,240
new so I repeat not new so okay sure if

560
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,520
you go and eat some conventional produce

561
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,360
um which we're going to talk about next

562
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,640
show by the way I think the next show if

563
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,919
you eat conventional produce and there's

564
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,200
some residue somewhere in there like if

565
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,360
you have some grapes and it's on the

566
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,760
skin of the

567
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,240
grape and you have that

568
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:58,360
pesticide you know it can add into it

569
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,320
over time but it's not the root cause

570
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,400
it's from copper and a

571
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,559
pesticide from Generations past it's

572
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,200
from your

573
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,440
parents parents it's from your

574
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,000
grandparents

575
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,919
grandparents okay that's what it's from

576
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,520
it's from

577
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:24,960
DDT starting from

578
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:28,360
1874 that's what it's from okay

579
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,760
and even though DDT was was really put

580
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,480
into high use in

581
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,960
1939 it's its forefathers were from 1874

582
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,720
and being used and being used widely so

583
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,559
you have to understand this goes back to

584
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:49,279
1874 prior 1874 psoriasis and and and

585
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:53,200
and um psoriasis and eczema was rare

586
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:57,279
when I mean rare barely existed and what

587
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,120
existed of it was from copper poisoning

588
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,080
from copper

589
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,880
pipes copper

590
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,039
pipes and things of that nature that

591
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,799
were just being developed you know

592
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,480
basically um and the industries copper

593
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,840
exposure copper poisoning from the

594
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,399
industries but the Xmen psoriasis

595
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,240
boom came out of the pesticide World

596
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:27,120
starting in

597
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,919
1874 okay and has been passed down from

598
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,600
our parents parents to their parents to

599
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,200
their parents and sometimes you know

600
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,520
depending how long someone lives it

601
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,120
could be a more than a few Generations

602
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,399
depending on I mean you know if they

603
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,000
haven't lived that long in certain

604
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:42,720
aspects of the family line then it could

605
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,640
be multiple Generations between 1874 on

606
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,919
and even earlier and so this is the root

607
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,000
the root it's also why babies have

608
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,840
eczema they have copper in the

609
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,559
liver copper in the liver and the

610
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,279
pathogens from the parents and from the

611
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:06,840
parents and it from being passed down

612
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:10,520
now the problem here is the copper stops

613
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:13,320
the pesticide or the old DDT from

614
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,600
degrading it stops it from degrading

615
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:21,200
This is complicated stuff basically the

616
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:23,440
copper stops the rest of the pesticide

617
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,640
from minimizing and minimizing and

618
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,200
minimizing so that it becomes less and

619
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,039
less so exen cisis Fades away our world

620
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,880
it doesn't fade away because the copper

621
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,760
stops it from degrading and every

622
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,240
generation pass

623
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,919
down you see how it works so and then

624
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,159
when there's a pathogen consuming copper

625
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,919
in the

626
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:48,039
liver including copper we can collect

627
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,000
even more you know from copper pipes in

628
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,640
houses drinking water out of copper

629
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,240
pipes or if we're getting too many

630
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,919
pesticides in us that still have copper

631
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,480
in it to some degree if we're adding to

632
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,840
it it doesn't help we're adding new

633
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,080
stuff to it but it's mostly from old old

634
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,080
times it's passed down generation to

635
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,559
generation this is the confusion of

636
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,360
medical research and medical science

637
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,240
saying it's hereditarian your genes that

638
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,799
that's the

639
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:20,880
confusion I mean that's how it

640
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,880
works this is simplistic really I mean

641
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,880
we're just not there yet so let's suffer

642
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,799
for another hundred years for I mean

643
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,200
that's really medical research and IAL

644
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,559
science can't come down to the basics

645
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,799
they do it with heart surgery though

646
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,120
I'll tell you and they can REM remove

647
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:38,520
aneurysms out of the brain good and they

648
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,720
can fix broken bones like they never did

649
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,880
before and they could put a lot of

650
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,919
screws and a lot of rods in you that we

651
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,720
need and a lot of you know a lot of

652
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,880
titanium rods they can do amazing work

653
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,240
so you know and if your gallbladder is

654
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,960
about to explode because you haven't

655
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,200
taken care of yourself and you're eating

656
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,039
too many fried foods and yeah I mean if

657
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,559
we need the gallbladder out they're

658
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:02,360
they're there and they're ready so don't

659
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,240
get me wrong when when I really get

660
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,559
snarky about things but when it comes

661
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,840
down to chronic illness and the

662
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,120
suffering we have problems we have holes

663
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,080
in the whole whole thing there's cracks

664
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,880
in the sidewalk everything is slipped

665
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,240
through and that's what we're really you

666
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,600
know airing out so we'll talk about this

667
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,799
copper thing again so this is from old

668
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,320
Generations passed down this is from DDT

669
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,720
from Generations passed down the copper

670
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,399
keeps the DDT from degrading and other

671
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,480
pesticides from

672
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:35,279
degrading and this is how it works so um

673
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,120
and if we collect outside sources it

674
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,039
doesn't help and if we're hard on our

675
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,159
liver anyway so say you're someone with

676
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,640
exra examon orias and you end up getting

677
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,880
a pre- fatty liver because of your diet

678
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,279
on top of everything thing it only makes

679
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,559
it worse and compiles it and makes it

680
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:57,039
more

681
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,919
difficult and that's the problem there

682
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,120
so

683
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,200
what here's here's also how it works so

684
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,880
I told you about the the hereditary

685
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,440
factor and and how it gets passed down

686
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,799
from relatives and relatives and that's

687
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,720
how we get the same issue okay and um

688
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:18,080
but there's also it also works like this

689
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,919
um when the when the toxin surface to

690
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,640
the

691
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:25,399
skin everybody's different so a lot of

692
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,039
times the patterns change and pathogens

693
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:29,399
are sometimes different in different

694
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,799
people too so in a family line you can

695
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,000
have a different pathogen in the liver

696
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:35,799
consuming the copper and the old

697
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,720
pesticides that won't degrade from

698
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,000
generation after generation after

699
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,360
generation and will get different

700
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,159
markings on the body the reason why

701
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,000
someone has these little spots tiny

702
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,120
little spots with eczema another person

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,480
has large patches another person has

704
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,399
entire one patch it's just all red just

705
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,799
everywhere another person has like

706
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,600
skin-like leather because it's all there

707
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:00,399
another person has you know one type of

708
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,840
psoriasis that flakes off and and breaks

709
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,000
another kind doesn't do it at all but

710
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,880
just you know swells up it's all these

711
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,240
differences matter to how much of what

712
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,360
variety of pesticides in the liver

713
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,640
mostly containing to Old DDT from the

714
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,960
old days let me tell you about what they

715
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,279
used to do with DDT in the old days um

716
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,840
they used to spray it in the streets and

717
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,559
they used to wash the streets down with

718
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,760
it that's what they used to do they used

719
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,640
to wash the parks down with it they used

720
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,360
to spray the entire parks while the kids

721
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,559
were playing in it that's what they used

722
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,240
to do just with trucks just come by with

723
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:38,399
a truck and hose the entire park down

724
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,799
while kids were CH children were playing

725
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,679
in the suds and bathing in the suds of

726
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,600
it that's what they did not only was it

727
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,000
all over food like pesticides are today

728
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,720
you know which are bad of course the

729
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,799
pesticides today are bad Not only was it

730
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,159
over food but it was considered a

731
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,399
nutritional supplement so if it was on

732
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:00,120
your Apple then you were going to get

733
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:03,320
healthier you there were signs in the

734
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,679
markets with a child eating an apple

735
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:09,159
okay and and a can of DDT spray next to

736
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:10,840
it saying DDT is good for me so we're

737
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,120
talking about it was it was out of

738
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,360
control that's our psoriasis and ezema

739
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,279
problem of today that's the big part

740
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,320
that's developed over the years now of

741
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,080
course our pesticides today they're

742
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,399
they're no better and they add to it and

743
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,760
add to it it's just that we're not as

744
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,919
saturated with them as much for the most

745
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,600
part unless you're getting your lawn

746
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,200
sprayed and you're doing other things

747
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,200
and getting your house sprayed with

748
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,039
insecticides so if you're someone with

749
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,120
eimon the first thing you got to do you

750
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,240
have to eat as organic as you can I mean

751
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,080
do you do the best you can that's I mean

752
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,559
w with the ability that you have that's

753
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
the first thing you do second thing you

754
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,200
do is you make sure there's no

755
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,000
insecticides being sprayed in your

756
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,279
house don't worry about the ants you

757
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,240
leave the ants don't worry don't worry

758
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,519
about the ants okay and just or whatever

759
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,480
it is okay just don't worry because it

760
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,960
can be a lot worse you keep on getting

761
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,120
those sprays inside the house so that's

762
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,919
a big deal

763
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,519
too um all this matters now the reason

764
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,399
why there's different levels of it like

765
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,200
I said is there's different levels of

766
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:17,440
the pesticide different levels of the

767
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,120
ancient DVT from our forefathers there's

768
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,519
different levels of copper and they're

769
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,279
different pathogens so it makes up for a

770
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,440
complicated process for medical research

771
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,799
and medical science to ever really

772
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,760
through they don't like to go there it's

773
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,320
just way too much funding way too much

774
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,360
money to figure out the different levels

775
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,960
of what people have in their liver what

776
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,799
pathogen is creating it and what the

777
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,799
outcome is on the body so it's best to

778
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,480
just say you're you're at fault you got

779
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:50,159
stupid genes okay and that's pretty much

780
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,600
what it is and or you um or you're just

781
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
you know it's your body attacking itself

782
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,919
why not why not tell everybody that I

783
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,639
guess you know so

784
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:05,840
exactly right so um so a little bit more

785
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:07,799
about how this works um you know the

786
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,080
alternative world of health so

787
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,519
functional and alternative world uh

788
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,799
believes that it's autoimmune and the

789
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,600
body is attacking itself and um even

790
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,000
though the alternative world is smart

791
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,720
about everything meaning smart about

792
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,880
everything in the sense where hey

793
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,440
processed food has to go away you know

794
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,600
you go on healthier Di diet there's

795
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,000
healthier your vegan diets there's

796
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,440
healthier your P paleo diets where you

797
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,799
take out all the garbage you take out

798
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,720
the fried foods you take out everything

799
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:39,360
else you know there's a a food War

800
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,480
actually going on out there I did a show

801
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,760
on it I'm going to do another show

802
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,039
there's a food War got all the Paleo

803
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,559
people and you know meaning the leaders

804
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,000
of the Paleo movement and they're just

805
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,279
they just hate the vegans and you get

806
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
all the plant-based people exactly

807
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,320
vegans and vetetans all plant-based

808
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,360
people they they hate the Paleo people

809
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,799
there's a big war out there um and it's

810
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,480
not about that you know I I do know that

811
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,080
you know some paleo diets are helping

812
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,200
people they take out the processed foods

813
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,600
they take out the McDonald's they take

814
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,760
out the fast foods they take out

815
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,359
everything else and people start getting

816
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,839
better you know and I know that there's

817
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,240
the plant-based plant-based world where

818
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,679
you know everybody's taking out

819
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,879
everything and and they're getting

820
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,760
better they're getting better it's

821
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,639
wherever you feel you have to go to if

822
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,240
you're not getting the results in one

823
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,440
angle and first of all you got to give

824
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,879
it you know a longer test p you have to

825
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,399
give it longer time and don't give up

826
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,760
early on trying something new um and you

827
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,679
know and you can find your way um and

828
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,320
but eating healthier matters no matter

829
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,679
what and we're going to do a lot more

830
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,240
food talk especially with the

831
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,599
life-changing food book we're going to

832
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,359
talk about you know all of it and I

833
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,560
actually laid out in the life-changing

834
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:52,879
Foods book a really good chapter on what

835
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,280
not to eat and why you shouldn't be

836
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,760
eating it with what illnesses you have

837
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,640
um and that's whole another area now

838
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:04,720
when it comes to psoriasis and it comes

839
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:08,359
to eczema your better angle to

840
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,480
go is actually not just no processed

841
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:12,280
foods so it's not just hey keep the

842
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,160
processed foods away keep the fried

843
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,680
foods away keep the wheat away when

844
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,119
you're dealing with Xmen resses you want

845
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,280
to go all the way over you want to go

846
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,599
more

847
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,359
plant-based um and like I said that

848
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:26,400
doesn't mean I don't like paleo diets

849
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:28,200
that doesn't mean I don't like you know

850
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
whatever eating all the different diets

851
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,560
that are out there it's not about what I

852
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,760
like in the end it's about what's right

853
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,160
for the person what's right for the

854
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,640
illness it's what's right for what's

855
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,400
going on and what spirit says that's

856
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,640
what matters the most because if I start

857
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,160
thinking of what I like then that's a

858
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,520
different story people won't get what

859
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,880
they need it has to come from Spirit so

860
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,960
when you're dealing with psoriasis and

861
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,599
eczema you really want to go towards a

862
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,760
little bit more towards the plant-based

863
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,040
angles if you're into a lot of animal

864
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,359
products you want to lower them it

865
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,920
doesn't mean you have to get rid of them

866
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,760
all together depending on who you are

867
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,920
and how severe it is the reason why I

868
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,040
say this is because in order for the the

869
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,319
liver to release copper and get the

870
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,800
copper out and release deep pesticides

871
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,280
that are in the liver you got to have a

872
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,960
little bit lower fat so you can do just

873
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
a little bit lower fat you have to lower

874
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,800
the fats in your diet you know the 28

875
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,839
day cleanse in the medical medium book

876
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,720
has really helped thousands with examen

877
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:27,480
psoriasis thousands with examen

878
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,079
psoriasis because it took out the fat

879
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,119
the high fat including a lot of the

880
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:35,280
plant fat and it made it so the liver

881
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,040
can recover release copper release

882
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,359
pesticides and the pathogen can actually

883
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,880
just start to uh break down and have

884
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:44,079
nothing to do anymore because it doesn't

885
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,880
have any food to eat and that's how

886
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,280
psoriasis and eczema clears up um in

887
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,000
people um once it's cleared up and

888
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,280
you're in a great place then you can

889
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
move forward and you can if you want to

890
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,319
do a healthy paleo diet or you know a

891
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,040
little bit more animal protein cuz

892
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,520
that's what you like or that's what

893
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,839
someone told you as best you could try

894
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,160
different things you go in different

895
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,920
directions um but in this situation it's

896
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,079
important different situations different

897
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,839
illnesses different complications with

898
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:13,079
People's Health you got to do different

899
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:15,160
things um so it's uh it it's that

900
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,280
important as far as the balance of it

901
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,800
all and that's what we're going to we're

902
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,040
going to talk about a little bit more um

903
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,760
the thing is is that with xon and

904
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,200
psoriasis is that there's Cycles it's

905
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,040
cyclical so it runs Cycles a lot of

906
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,880
times when someone's involved you know

907
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:35,800
they're in that aimen psoriasis it

908
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,800
becomes like it starts to clear up and

909
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,040
then 3 weeks later four weeks later you

910
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,440
might be one of these people that are

911
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,079
experiencing this it starts to then come

912
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,880
back a little bit more but less and then

913
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,800
starts to clear up come back until

914
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,359
finally it gets cleared up all together

915
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,280
so anyone healing from it right now

916
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:54,119
realize it's going to kind of come and

917
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,560
go a little less it's going to be

918
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,480
cyclical it's going to be doing this

919
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,640
thing until finally It Go goes away

920
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,079
completely it's something to understand

921
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,680
on how it works and then you know you

922
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,440
get it cleaned up and you can bring back

923
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,240

incredible for psoriasis and eczema what

937
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:47,440
this means is is if you have say a

938
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,720
healthy standard American diet but a

939
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,960
healthy version you want to start you

940
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,359
know minimizing anything like the grains

941
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,119
you want to minimize any kind of wheat

go crazy or all the way if you don't

949
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,160

you've been living this with this for a

951
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,319
long time I would do the 28 day cleanse

952
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,640
I would stay off of all animal products

953
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:22,680
for a little while in your life and

954
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,000

products listen I I understand the

973
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,440
grass-fed beef butter thing I think it's

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,720
the healthiest butter on the planet I

975
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,160
understand the yogurts I get it but

976
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,079
we're talking about psoriasis we're

977
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,880
talking about Eczema we're not talking

978
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,040
about food Wars and food belief systems

979
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,920
okay so you have to understand that so

980
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,240
anyone out there who's like really big

981
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,760
on something like their grass-fed butter

982
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,960
don't get mad at me because it doesn't

983
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,000
mean I don't like it it just means this

984
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,880
is something that you know with the

985
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,440
aasis it can't be there if it's there it

986
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:51,599
doesn't help the exis go away that's all

987
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:54,720
um so you want no Dairy no eggs eggs you

988
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,920
don't want with examen sasis it'll keep

989
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,040
it around forever and it it'll keep the

990
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,200
copper in the liver and it'll keep the

991
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,040
old pesticides going all the way back in

992
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,359
the liver they just won't go away really

993
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,319
important to understand so um no canola

994
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,440
oil you know that no canola oil that's

995
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,520
got to go and like I said before you got

996
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,680
to lower the animal proteins if you need

997
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,200
the exis to go wave in more you have to

998
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,520
eliminate them for a while in your life

999
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,720
you could bring them back later it's not

1000
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,560
about the belief system it's about

1001
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,480
what's right for the moment at the time

1002
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,319
in your life always have to remember

1003
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,880
that people get really

1004
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,280
upset if I start leaning on one side or

1005
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,760
the other or whatever it is it's not

1006
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,079
about that it's about what's happening

1007
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,720
in your health and what's needed in that

1008
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,240
moment if you had a kidney disease if

1009
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,599
you had a kidney disease or if you were

1010
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,160
on dialysis I would have you remove all

1011
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:50,520
animal protein because animal protein

1012
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,280
kills the kidneys when you're on

1013
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,200
dialysis it's about what you need and

1014
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
then if you're somebody and you don't

1015
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,720
you know and and you can't you know you

1016
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,079
can't you have so many food

1017
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,240
sensitivities and you can't eat anything

1018
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,520
and you got to live off of turkey

1019
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,400
absolutely then you live off a turkey

1020
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,119
I'm for it until the body calms down so

1021
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,200
I'm in there with you no matter what

1022
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,480
it's just about what we need for what we

1023
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,359
need and I have to express this because

1024
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,000
um you know we do we do every now and

1025
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,599
then get someone saying wait a minute

1026
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,359
wait what is he talking about okay so

1027
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,800
you know there's acne which I didn't

1028
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,760
cover a lot didn't cover at all today

1029
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,319
want to talk about cystic acne the cause

1030
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,680
is Strep that's the cause it's the

1031
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,800
bacteria strep strep a cacus that's the

1032
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,800
bacteria that causes acne so when people

1033
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,920
say well it's hormonal it's it's not

1034
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,079
hormonal it's actually strep it's just

1035
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,680
that hormones are steroids and when

1036
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,000
they're out of syn or they're raging

1037
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,319
whether they're out of syn or they're

1038
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,319
raging okay they break down the immune

1039
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,599
system and strep grows rapidly so when

1040
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,960
we're hormonal in different ways in our

1041
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,760
life whatever that angle may be the

1042
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,160
strap a caucus if we have it in our

1043
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,079
system um proliferates it actually grows

1044
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,440
in high abundance and that's so when

1045
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,920
we're going through puberty or we're

1046
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,280
going through when're we're going

1047
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,200
through puberty we're having a serious

1048
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,400
metabolic change in the body we're

1049
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,240
actually the immune system is is not

1050
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,800
getting stronger it weakens for the

1051
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,960
moment actually through puberty it's

1052
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,880
another reason why Epstein bar and mono

1053
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,920
come come so heavily handed in puberty

1054
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,520
and after because we lose all our zinc

1055
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,119
we lose our immune system when we go

1056
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,920
through hormonal changes um same thing

1057
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,280
with pregnancies our immune system drops

1058
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,319
during pregnancies acne comes acne comes

1059
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,040
after delivering a baby acne comes when

1060
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:46,040
we're pregnant a acne comes when we're

1061
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,880
ovulating acne comes during periods and

1062
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,400
and menstration it's all because these

1063
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,480
are times when the immune system abs and

1064
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,839
flows and drops and lowers and the strep

1065
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,119
that's in the body raises it's a it's a

1066
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:59,480
balance that happens all the time time

1067
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,000
cystic acne is chronic strep from your

1068
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,040
strep throat you had when you were 3

1069
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,440
years old that you didn't know about

1070
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,960
from that ear infection you had when you

1071
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,160
were 5 years old and it sits in the body

1072
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,040
and it causes the cystic acne so when

1073
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,920
you're dealing with strep we want

1074
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,240
different supplements you want zinc

1075
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,160
that's a critical one when you're

1076
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,119
dealing with STP you want um golden seal

1077
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,640
periodically go to a practitioner talk

1078
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,319
about how you can do some golden seal

1079
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,599
periodically go to an herbalist um you

1080
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:31,040
want time time tea when you're dealing

1081
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,440
with acne you want um you want lemon

1082
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,160

they give out antibiotics left and right

1150
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,359
