[209.20 - 212.88] in so many different ways so let's get
[211.92 - 217.12] started
[212.88 - 220.32] you guys so what's cool about these
[217.12 - 222.80] is you can't really mess up
[220.32 - 223.52] it's not really possible except if you
[222.80 - 225.60] don't roll
[223.52 - 227.36] your norrish you know right if you don't
[225.60 - 229.04] roll your nori sheet right that may be
[227.36 - 230.48] one way but you can't really go
[229.04 - 233.12] too wrong but i'm gonna give you all the
[230.48 - 234.24] tips important tips when you're doing
[233.12 - 236.48] this right here
[234.24 - 238.56] so everything matters with that now you
[236.48 - 240.00] can damp the nori sheet which is what i
[238.56 - 242.80] like to do i like to damp
[240.00 - 244.24] it dampen it right you can dampen it
[242.80 - 246.16] with a little bit of water
[244.24 - 248.56] like just like very like a little bit of
[246.16 - 251.52] water on your fingertips if you want
[248.56 - 253.12] i like to use orange for this recipe a
[251.52 - 256.00] lot of other recipes i use
[253.12 - 257.92] lemon to dampen the nori sheet just
[256.00 - 260.72] letting you know but i'm going to use
[257.92 - 262.96] orange right here christina massey i
[260.72 - 264.40] started in june last year with celery
[262.96 - 267.04] juice took me four months
[264.40 - 268.00] no more migraines god bless you
[267.04 - 271.44] incredible
[268.00 - 274.56] so proud of you um that's
[271.44 - 276.16] that's the power of celery juice but
[274.56 - 278.32] hey you know christina there's no
[276.16 - 281.04] scientific studies out there
[278.32 - 282.00] so for celery juice but you kept with it
[281.04 - 284.48] you know so you must
[282.00 - 287.04] be pretty spiritual because that
[284.48 - 289.44] information comes from above and
[287.04 - 290.88] there's no scientific study that fixes
[289.44 - 292.32] people with chronic illness or chronic
[290.88 - 293.68] migraines or anything
[292.32 - 295.52] and that's what people say to be like
[293.68 - 296.00] well don't drink your celery juice
[295.52 - 299.12] there's no
[296.00 - 299.92] scientific study oh that's funny that's
[299.12 - 302.08] a good one
[299.92 - 303.92] you know i cuz because i didn't know
[302.08 - 304.40] scientific studies actually got anybody
[303.92 - 307.36] all these
[304.40 - 308.88] all these years better 30 40 50 60 years
[307.36 - 310.80] of chronic illness and there's not one
[308.88 - 312.48] scientific study that fixed anybody with
[310.80 - 315.52] that mysterious chronic illness
[312.48 - 317.52] but celery juice works but hey
[315.52 - 319.60] no one wants you on there in the science
[317.52 - 320.88] world because it wasn't studied so they
[319.60 - 322.72] don't want you drinking it they would
[320.88 - 325.12] rather have your migraines christina
[322.72 - 329.84] stay there forever and free to suffer
[325.12 - 329.84] so hey i'm proud of you amazing um
[330.40 - 334.72] yeah i'm a handful today for sure i got
[332.96 - 336.40] lots of stuff to talk about you guys
[334.72 - 338.32] you might want to hang in there for this
[336.40 - 340.00] one if you guys have a glitch on
[338.32 - 341.44] facebook just go to youtube i'm live
[340.00 - 344.24] right now and i'm going to be
[341.44 - 345.84] on tick tock live later because we got
[344.24 - 347.36] some glitches on instagram
[345.84 - 348.96] so i'm going to be on tick tock live
[347.36 - 352.72] later too
[348.96 - 356.00] um there's no shingles
[352.72 - 358.88] test just so you know that so
[356.00 - 359.36] uh lorraine casey hi anthony what do you
[358.88 - 361.84] ask
[359.36 - 363.04] our doctor to test for if you think you
[361.84 - 364.96] have shingles they
[363.04 - 368.16] can't test for that it's really hard to
[364.96 - 371.28] find that shingles virus
[368.16 - 373.92] really difficult so what happens is with
[371.28 - 376.88] viruses like shingles and epstein-barr
[373.92 - 379.44] is they may trigger off the a a they may
[376.88 - 382.32] trigger off the c-reactive protein test
[379.44 - 384.00] they may trigger off the mthfr gene
[382.32 - 387.20] mutation test these are all
[384.00 - 389.04] in inflammation markers right
[387.20 - 391.04] so when your doctors just say to your
[389.04 - 393.20] doctor hey test for any inflammation
[391.04 - 393.52] markers then if anything comes up with
[393.20 - 396.72] any
[393.52 - 398.80] mysterious inflammation anywhere that
[396.72 - 401.04] could be right there the a a and so
[398.80 - 402.32] forth an anti-nuclear antigen test
[401.04 - 404.08] that could lead to hey there's
[402.32 - 405.68] epstein-barr behind the scenes there's
[404.08 - 406.64] shingles behind the scenes but they
[405.68 - 410.00] don't have
[406.64 - 412.08] a grip on the over 30 varieties of
[410.00 - 413.92] shingles that i talk about in the books
[412.08 - 416.24] there's cleanse the heel right here they
[413.92 - 419.92] don't have a grip on that
[416.24 - 421.52] so um anyway and then but i got to tell
[419.92 - 422.32] you here that's protocols in there i got
[421.52 - 424.80] to tell you
[422.32 - 425.92] this book right here has the shingles
[424.80 - 428.96] chapter
[425.92 - 430.80] that has really uncovered the whole
[428.96 - 432.80] thing with the 30 varieties of shingles
[430.80 - 434.16] i added information in this book this is
[432.80 - 436.08] the new edition
[434.16 - 438.32] holt shingles chapter in here this is
[436.08 - 439.84] the one with the non-rashing shingles
[438.32 - 442.88] the rashing shingles this is
[439.84 - 445.44] mind-blowing check that out
[442.88 - 446.96] um making nora rolls right now so look
[445.44 - 449.36] let's start with
[446.96 - 450.56] banana we'll do potato we'll do a banana
[449.36 - 452.64] then we'll do potato
[450.56 - 454.32] we'll do banana then we'll do potato
[452.64 - 456.80] right um
[454.32 - 458.16] so anyway let's talk about shingles for
[456.80 - 458.96] a minute because lorraine that was
[458.16 - 462.56] really
[458.96 - 464.80] you know important right there shingles
[462.56 - 466.56] causes that sciatic nerve pain people
[464.80 - 467.76] don't know about and i talk about that
[466.56 - 470.88] in book one
[467.76 - 472.88] so it causes trigeminal neuralgia
[470.88 - 475.28] that's another thing i talk about in
[472.88 - 477.68] book one so that's another one
[475.28 - 478.64] shingles causes a lot of different
[477.68 - 480.96] things and
[478.64 - 482.96] this is the book that started it all
[480.96 - 486.08] about shingles this is what's teaching
[482.96 - 488.08] people that shingles isn't just a rash
[486.08 - 489.28] and that's the whole point this is the
[488.08 - 491.44] book that actually
[489.28 - 493.20] uncovered that so now doctors know that
[491.44 - 494.80] shingles may not be a rash
[493.20 - 496.24] um other health professionals health
[494.80 - 496.56] authorities know that shingles may not
[496.24 - 499.28] be
[496.56 - 501.04] rash based it's not just that rash the
[499.28 - 504.40] link is in the description

[595.04 - 598.48] on non-rashing shingles has saved my
[597.52 - 600.48] sanity
[598.48 - 601.84] as it's the first time the symptoms you
[600.48 - 604.80] explain are spot
[601.84 - 605.84] on one after the other thank you janine
[604.80 - 608.96] thanks for being here
[605.84 - 612.08] bless your heart so glad you're here um
[608.96 - 615.28] you guys in this nori roll i'm gonna put
[612.08 - 618.16] a green onion which is a scallion um
[615.28 - 619.60] you can call them green onions uh i call
[618.16 - 621.76] them scallions and you can cut that
[619.60 - 623.52] scallion in half if you want to
[621.76 - 625.36] i like to cut them i also like to leave
[623.52 - 626.64] them whole it depends on how i'm feeling
[625.36 - 628.64] that day i might
[626.64 - 629.84] with the mood i'm in like what kind of
[628.64 - 632.80] mood i'm in
[629.84 - 633.76] so i'm kind of tearing this scallion
[632.80 - 636.40] apart a little bit
[633.76 - 636.80] putting it in here so i got the scallion
[636.40 - 638.88] in there
[636.80 - 640.08] that's the green onion i got some
[638.88 - 641.92] sprouts i'm going to put a little bit
[640.08 - 643.52] more of these alfalfa sprouts these are
[641.92 - 648.72] healing foods
[643.52 - 650.64] sprouts are a powerful healing tool
[648.72 - 652.08] we got some of this too we got some of
[650.64 - 655.12] this cilantro
[652.08 - 655.52] julie i get back pain every time i get a
[655.12 - 659.52] big
[655.52 - 662.00] upset what happens is that
[659.52 - 663.20] when you get upset like a big upset like
[662.00 - 665.52] any kind of stress
[663.20 - 666.64] or something really triggers you off
[665.52 - 669.12] adrenaline
[666.64 - 670.40] can actually up that inflammation
[669.12 - 673.36] because adrenaline
[670.40 - 674.00] could stimulate and feed a virus like
[673.36 - 676.48] shingles
[674.00 - 678.16] also adrenaline can lower the immune
[676.48 - 679.76] system so if you get a big upset your
[678.16 - 681.92] immune system lowers
[679.76 - 683.76] low-grade viral stuff kicks up and then
[681.92 - 684.72] boom the back has a problem that's how
[683.76 - 688.40] it works
[684.72 - 690.88] um this is dulce these are dulce
[688.40 - 692.88] strips right here i like being generous
[690.88 - 694.88] with dolls inside these nori wraps this
[692.88 - 697.44] is the banana nori wrap you can do

[703.28 - 708.80] i'm not going to moisten these i'm going
[706.32 - 712.08] to kind of leave them dry
[708.80 - 712.72] and flavor is just so packed in that
[712.08 - 714.96] nori
[712.72 - 716.00] that that i'm sorry dulce strip that's
[714.96 - 718.64] what it is

[731.04 - 733.76] try susie there's so many great
[732.80 - 737.20] vegetables
[733.76 - 737.92] corn is a grain so that's not even a
[737.20 - 740.48] vegetable
[737.92 - 741.44] so i have to we have to find a vegetable
[740.48 - 745.20] for you

[745.20 - 748.96] i'm gonna roll this up so i have the
[747.36 - 750.64] dolls in here i got a little bit of
[748.96 - 752.08] cilantro i'm gonna talk about the power
[750.64 - 754.48] of cilantro in a little while
[752.08 - 755.92] kyle wick good to see you what else can
[754.48 - 759.20] i do i do the three
[755.92 - 761.84] things in the morning heavy metal detox
[759.20 - 764.08] celery juice and lemon water for my
[761.84 - 766.96] rheumatoid arthritis room toward pain
[764.08 - 768.56] what else is going on okay first of all
[766.96 - 769.36] you're doing some incredible things
[768.56 - 771.60] right there
[769.36 - 772.48] okay so that's to start with guys i just
[771.60 - 775.28] rolled up
[772.48 - 775.68] anori right here this is the banananori
[775.28 - 778.72] wrap
[775.68 - 780.32] um this is one i'm
[778.72 - 781.60] not going to cut it yet but i'm going to
[780.32 - 784.24] eventually get there i'm going to roll a
[781.60 - 784.24] couple of these
[784.40 - 789.44] um first of all there's protocols
[787.36 - 792.48] there's a there's a ra protocol
[789.44 - 793.44] in cleanse the heal but in this book
[792.48 - 796.72] here
[793.44 - 798.48] i mean there's really infra this thing's
[796.72 - 799.52] packed with ra information with the
[798.48 - 801.84] protocol
[799.52 - 803.12] and what ra is diagnosed as an
[801.84 - 804.96] autoimmune condition
[803.12 - 806.32] autoimmune condition means they don't
[804.96 - 808.08] know science research
[806.32 - 809.60] doesn't know what's causing it so it's a
[808.08 - 812.80] mystery i
[809.60 - 814.24] i reveal that mystery it's viral the
[812.80 - 817.36] cause of ra
[814.24 - 819.84] rheumatoid arthritis is epstein-barr so
[817.36 - 821.68] if you want to heal and you're doing the
[819.84 - 822.96] celery juice and heavy metal detox
[821.68 - 823.76] you're doing lemon water it's a great
[822.96 - 825.92] start
[823.76 - 828.40] but it would be good to learn maybe what
[825.92 - 830.48] foods you shouldn't do because those
[828.40 - 832.56] foods will feed the epstein-barr virus
[830.48 - 834.80] make you sicker or maybe learn a
[832.56 - 836.40] protocol that's in here
[834.80 - 838.08] so this is the new addition make sure
[836.40 - 840.48] it's a new edition that's the way to go
[838.08 - 840.48] on that
[841.12 - 844.56] so i'm going to make another one with
[843.12 - 845.76] you guys we're going to make a bunch of
[844.56 - 848.08] these i'm going to cut them up in a
[845.76 - 850.16] little while too
[848.08 - 852.32] and you guys have been thinking about a
[850.16 - 854.40] couple different things
[852.32 - 855.60] you know a friend of mine i haven't
[854.40 - 859.36] talked to in a long time
[855.60 - 861.04] right she's pregnant and
[859.36 - 863.36] she was asking me different things what
[861.04 - 868.32] can she do for her health
[863.36 - 870.40] and i found out that she's on caffeine
[868.32 - 872.72] she was on a lot of caffeine before she
[870.40 - 876.32] got pregnant
[872.72 - 878.00] and she's on caffeine while she's
[876.32 - 881.28] pregnant
[878.00 - 884.80] now she didn't know she was on caffeine
[881.28 - 886.72] while she's pregnant but she found out
[884.80 - 887.84] when i spoke to her she was on a lot of
[886.72 - 890.00] caffeine
[887.84 - 890.88] while being pregnant and i want to talk
[890.00 - 892.16] about
[890.88 - 894.16] what happens there because she was
[892.16 - 897.92] asking me well what can go wrong
[894.16 - 898.80] what can happen am i okay is my baby
[897.92 - 901.36] okay
[898.80 - 902.96] what does this mean so she didn't know
[901.36 - 905.28] she was on caffeine
[902.96 - 906.00] but she was she was eating chocolate
[905.28 - 909.76] every day
[906.00 - 913.84] she was told by a health practitioner
[909.76 - 915.92] she's told also by someone else that
[913.84 - 917.28] chocolate's really good for you when
[915.92 - 920.40] it's the 70
[917.28 - 922.96] 80 90 the dark chocolate the chocolate
[920.40 - 924.56] cacao nibs all that stuff
[922.96 - 926.00] chocolate powder so she was told it was
[924.56 - 929.92] really good for her so she
[926.00 - 932.24] was eating it while pregnant
[929.92 - 933.84] something to really kind of digest there
[932.24 - 934.80] for a second while i'm making this nori
[933.84 - 937.84] this next nori
[934.80 - 939.68] wrap um getting some sprouts here
[937.84 - 940.96] think about that a little bit she was
[939.68 - 943.04] asking me well
[940.96 - 945.12] i didn't know chocolate was packed with
[943.04 - 946.88] caffeine i go especially that chocolate
[945.12 - 948.88] it's really packed with caffeine she's
[946.88 - 949.44] like okay so i've been on caffeine every
[948.88 - 952.88] day
[949.44 - 955.84] with my baby i go yeah
[952.88 - 956.24] your baby's got the caffeine running
[955.84 - 959.84] through
[956.24 - 962.00] it you know and
[959.84 - 963.36] you know and right now she's she so
[962.00 - 965.28] she's
[963.36 - 966.80] she's so she got really spooked for a
[965.28 - 968.72] minute she's like what do i do i said
[966.80 - 970.56] first of all stop the caffeine
[968.72 - 972.24] and then she said well what is it doing
[970.56 - 974.64] to my baby
[972.24 - 975.36] what is it doing to my baby and i said
[974.64 - 976.80] for one
[975.36 - 978.56] your baby is not going to be able to
[976.80 - 980.32] rest so easy
[978.56 - 981.60] because your baby is going to be over
[980.32 - 984.00] stimulated
[981.60 - 986.24] and inside the womb basically your baby
[984.00 - 988.32] is going to be all jacked up on caffeine
[986.24 - 989.76] and that's going to be very difficult
[988.32 - 992.64] for the baby
[989.76 - 993.84] and she stopped immediately immediately
[992.64 - 996.80] just stopped
[993.84 - 999.12] she's a very spiritual person knows a
[996.80 - 1001.92] decent amount of health information
[999.12 - 1004.40] always thought herself to be you know
[1001.92 - 1007.36] yeah a health expert in many ways
[1004.40 - 1009.20] just a lot of natural things and having
[1007.36 - 1013.52] a natural childbirth
[1009.20 - 1016.24] right and she's got it all planned and
[1013.52 - 1018.64] her girlfriends are pregnant they're all
[1016.24 - 1021.52] eating chocolate
[1018.64 - 1023.44] and what happens is people wonder why
[1021.52 - 1026.88] their baby doesn't sleep
[1023.44 - 1028.88] when their baby's born
[1026.88 - 1032.08] babies going through withdrawal which
[1028.88 - 1034.00] all can last a long time for a baby
[1032.08 - 1035.76] and it depends on the breast milk too
[1034.00 - 1038.32] how much caffeine are you using
[1035.76 - 1039.04] that's going into the breast milk all
[1038.32 - 1040.40] this stuff
[1039.04 - 1041.84] really important information so i want
[1040.40 - 1045.36] to keep on going with it i just want to
[1041.84 - 1047.36] get this nori rolled up in a second here
[1045.36 - 1049.92] caffeine so i was telling her caffeine's
[1047.36 - 1053.04] a type of poison
[1049.92 - 1054.56] it's a drug and
[1053.04 - 1056.24] i'm going to get some i'm actually going
[1054.56 - 1058.16] to get some dull strips we're going to
[1056.24 - 1059.44] go inside this nori roll here
[1058.16 - 1061.36] it's delicious this is going to be so
[1059.44 - 1063.52] good so she was
[1061.36 - 1065.28] she was mortified because she was
[1063.52 - 1068.88] wondering
[1065.28 - 1070.56] because she's a mama bear you know in a
[1068.88 - 1071.52] sense where she told me she goes i'm a
[1070.56 - 1074.64] mama bear
[1071.52 - 1076.16] i protect my friends babies i protect my
[1074.64 - 1078.40] baby
[1076.16 - 1080.48] and that's what she said to me and she
[1078.40 - 1082.08] was she was wondering why
[1080.48 - 1083.84] health professionals are saying it's
[1082.08 - 1087.20] okay
[1083.84 - 1089.28] like she's wondering why her doctor
[1087.20 - 1092.00] thinks it's okay she's wondering why
[1089.28 - 1093.20] it's on the internet and it's okay and
[1092.00 - 1094.96] she's wondering why
[1093.20 - 1096.64] health influencers that are pregnant are
[1094.96 - 1097.92] thinking it's okay and health coaches
[1096.64 - 1099.28] tell health influencers that are
[1097.92 - 1103.84] pregnant and other people
[1099.28 - 1106.64] that it's okay and she's realizing
[1103.84 - 1107.60] it's not okay and it was like a huge
[1106.64 - 1111.20] awakening
[1107.60 - 1114.72] huge awakening just really was
[1111.20 - 1119.12] and so when you have that much caffeine
[1114.72 - 1119.12] running through your baby inside of you
[1119.20 - 1125.84] it's it's it's not a good thing
[1123.68 - 1127.28] if you don't know you just don't know
[1125.84 - 1129.84] it's nobody's fault
[1127.28 - 1131.20] not well actually it's not the mom's
[1129.84 - 1132.88] fault at all
[1131.20 - 1134.48] it's the fault of the system it's the
[1132.88 - 1138.08] fault of the caffeine
[1134.48 - 1138.80] industry it's the fault of caffeine
[1138.08 - 1142.24] industry
[1138.80 - 1144.48] health authorities health hackers
[1142.24 - 1146.32] that think they're health experts it's
[1144.48 - 1149.36] the fault of all them
[1146.32 - 1150.00] and then them telling women it's okay to
[1149.36 - 1151.36] do caffeine
[1150.00 - 1153.76] while you're pregnant okay to do
[1151.36 - 1154.24] caffeine after pregnancy and everything
[1153.76 - 1158.08] else
[1154.24 - 1160.24] so so um but
[1158.08 - 1162.56] but the thing is is that the bottom line
[1160.24 - 1164.96] is when it comes down to that
[1162.56 - 1166.48] a lot of things can happen your baby can
[1164.96 - 1170.16] not rest
[1166.48 - 1172.40] while your baby wants to rest internally
[1170.16 - 1174.00] and so that caffeine makes it so if the
[1172.40 - 1176.56] baby wanted to rest
[1174.00 - 1178.56] naturally if the baby was going to rest
[1176.56 - 1180.56] naturally because there's a resting
[1178.56 - 1182.72] there's a whole resting sequence that a
[1180.56 - 1184.80] baby has inside the womb
[1182.72 - 1186.08] that this shifts it and it rocks the
[1184.80 - 1188.64] boat constantly
[1186.08 - 1190.16] so and when that happens then you know
[1188.64 - 1192.16] when the baby's born
[1190.16 - 1193.92] then there's all kinds of sleep problems
[1192.16 - 1195.60] in different ways i mean
[1193.92 - 1197.52] baby could be up all night there's
[1195.60 - 1199.68] withdrawal and then
[1197.52 - 1201.28] if there's still chocolate happening
[1199.68 - 1202.72] dirt that's filling up the breast milk
[1201.28 - 1204.80] if you if the breast milk is getting
[1202.72 - 1206.16] filled up the coffee drink caffeine
[1204.80 - 1208.24] it's getting filled up with chocolate
[1206.16 - 1209.84] caffeine matcha tea caffeine
[1208.24 - 1212.08] and so they'll say oh matcha tea is good
[1209.84 - 1215.92] for pregnant women it's great for women
[1212.08 - 1217.44] get a lot of energy after a pregnancy
[1215.92 - 1218.64] after giving birth
[1217.44 - 1220.24] so i want to talk about that a little
[1218.64 - 1223.28] bit more too so i'm cutting these right
[1220.24 - 1226.32] here these two for now
[1223.28 - 1229.36] so that's a banana wrap right there
[1226.32 - 1231.20] i like them thinner so i do like them
[1229.36 - 1232.32] thinner so that's a banana wrap
[1231.20 - 1235.84] and i'll show you guys i'm going to make
[1232.32 - 1235.84] a lot more i got to make the potato wrap
[1236.08 - 1240.00] so women do a lot of caffeine before
[1238.48 - 1241.44] they get pregnant
[1240.00 - 1242.72] and they wear down their adrenals and
[1241.44 - 1244.40] they wear down their adrenals and they
[1242.72 - 1248.48] wear down their adrenals
[1244.40 - 1251.60] okay and then they have a difficult
[1248.48 - 1254.72] difficult uh birth childbirth
[1251.60 - 1256.80] because their adrenals weaken so it can
[1254.72 - 1259.68] lead into longer labor
[1256.80 - 1261.28] a much more difficult time but no one's
[1259.68 - 1264.08] teaching women about that
[1261.28 - 1266.00] so it could be years of caffeine use
[1264.08 - 1267.92] wasting the adrenals so by the time you
[1266.00 - 1269.84] have your baby
[1267.92 - 1271.68] then you have a difficult childbirth so
[1269.84 - 1277.60] there's that alone all on its own
[1271.68 - 1279.68] so that's an issue that happens too um
[1277.60 - 1281.44] it takes tremendous amounts of
[1279.68 - 1285.52] adrenaline
[1281.44 - 1287.20] to give birth it takes like a lifetime
[1285.52 - 1291.12] of adrenaline to give birth
[1287.20 - 1293.60] that's how the birthing process happens
[1291.12 - 1296.00] it's from that adrenaline surge
[1293.60 - 1297.92] and it's not just one adrenaline surge
[1296.00 - 1300.16] it's many adrenaline surges
[1297.92 - 1301.68] it's lots of adrenaline surges through
[1300.16 - 1303.68] throughout giving birth
[1301.68 - 1305.20] and the adrenals have to be strong for
[1303.68 - 1307.84] that and
[1305.20 - 1309.28] women's adrenals already are challenged
[1307.84 - 1311.28] in so many ways with just
[1309.28 - 1313.52] today's world in so many ways in
[1311.28 - 1316.00] different for different reasons
[1313.52 - 1320.08] and so when it comes down to needing all
[1316.00 - 1322.48] of that supersonic adrenaline strength
[1320.08 - 1324.08] to give birth it's not there so then the
[1322.48 - 1325.76] adrenals struggle and they struggle and
[1324.08 - 1328.24] they struggle and they struggle
[1325.76 - 1329.60] okay so that happens to women a lot
[1328.24 - 1331.52] that's one thing right there i'm making
[1329.60 - 1335.04] these banana wraps right here you guys
[1331.52 - 1335.04] be using some alfalfa sprouts
[1335.52 - 1341.04] but keep in mind though
[1338.88 - 1342.72] that the caffeine industry they don't
[1341.04 - 1343.68] care about any of this they just want to
[1342.72 - 1345.84] make sure that
[1343.68 - 1347.20] you get your high no one teaches you
[1345.84 - 1350.80] different
[1347.20 - 1352.80] and then after birth after birth
[1350.80 - 1354.24] a mom can be more exhausted than she
[1352.80 - 1356.08] should be because the adrenals aren't
[1354.24 - 1357.44] recouping so then you need more caffeine
[1356.08 - 1358.24] you need more chocolate you need more
[1357.44 - 1359.52] matcha tea you need
[1358.24 - 1361.36] more green tea you need more coffee
[1359.52 - 1364.00] drinks
[1361.36 - 1364.80] because you're trying to overcompensate
[1364.00 - 1367.20] for that more
[1364.80 - 1368.24] loss that more loss and that more loss
[1367.20 - 1371.60] you know
[1368.24 - 1373.36] and um so that's important to know there
[1371.60 - 1375.36] that's something to consider but then
[1373.36 - 1377.12] it's after with the breastfeeding that's
[1375.36 - 1378.80] the thing too you got to keep in mind
[1377.12 - 1380.64] with the breastfeeding
[1378.80 - 1381.92] because of the breastfeeding the milk is
[1380.64 - 1384.40] contaminated with
[1381.92 - 1386.24] caffeine which is a poison and that's a
[1384.40 - 1386.72] whole other thing on its own that we got
[1386.24 - 1390.88] to be
[1386.72 - 1390.88] mindful about putting some dolls in here
[1391.92 - 1399.28] um guys making another one
[1395.84 - 1399.28] another banana roll right here
[1401.52 - 1405.20] so these are all things that kind of
[1403.68 - 1408.64] keep to keep an eye on
[1405.20 - 1408.64] so i'm rolling this one right here
[1410.40 - 1416.96] so you guys if you just got here
[1413.76 - 1419.60] i'm making these bananas nori wraps
[1416.96 - 1421.12] so that's what i'm making so here they
[1419.60 - 1421.92] are it's in the medical medium new
[1421.12 - 1424.16] edition
[1421.92 - 1425.60] i'm going to make potato wraps too so
[1424.16 - 1431.84] i'm in the process
[1425.60 - 1431.84] um going to make another
[1432.88 - 1436.88] yeah i mean look this might not be
[1434.24 - 1438.96] interesting to some people but
[1436.88 - 1440.48] i think our children are are really
[1438.96 - 1443.52] important i mean right
[1440.48 - 1444.72] that's the whole thing everybody is so
[1443.52 - 1447.68] worried
[1444.72 - 1448.24] about your children and rightfully so
[1447.68 - 1450.56] and
[1448.24 - 1453.52] i think that when health authorities and
[1450.56 - 1457.04] health experts don't teach women this
[1453.52 - 1459.20] it's like i mean they know better
[1457.04 - 1461.20] right don't they know better like the
[1459.20 - 1464.88] health health experts
[1461.20 - 1466.24] doctors should know better so um
[1464.88 - 1467.76] something to be considered i'm gonna
[1466.24 - 1470.08] make some potato wraps right now
[1467.76 - 1470.08] actually
[1471.20 - 1474.32] i'm going to move on to a potato wrap as
[1473.04 - 1479.04] we speak
[1474.32 - 1481.76] um so i'm cutting some potato slices
[1479.04 - 1481.76] nice and thin
[1483.20 - 1487.60] this is what i'm doing see guys i'll
[1486.32 - 1490.80] read some questions right here what
[1487.60 - 1490.80] comes after the sprouts
[1497.28 - 1501.84] i'll be right there
[1524.80 - 1528.00] i'm back so you guys making the potato
[1526.88 - 1531.36] version right here so
[1528.00 - 1531.36] i'm doing some cilantro
[1533.76 - 1536.96] doing the green onion again so it's for
[1535.28 - 1539.04] people that don't like bananas or
[1536.96 - 1540.48] they're afraid of bananas
[1539.04 - 1542.72] a lot of people are afraid of bananas
[1540.48 - 1544.96] which is really sad because potassium is
[1542.72 - 1546.08] a critical critical nutrient it really
[1544.96 - 1548.56] is
[1546.08 - 1550.96] critical mineral we need potassium for
[1548.56 - 1554.56] our brain for neurotransmitters
[1550.96 - 1556.48] so um i got some alfalfa sprouts i got
[1554.56 - 1557.76] some cilantro in here i got some green
[1556.48 - 1561.20] onion
[1557.76 - 1561.20] i'm gonna put a little bit of
[1561.60 - 1566.08] this dulse i'm gonna roll it up now you
[1564.64 - 1568.08] can do these in different ways like with
[1566.08 - 1571.28] the banana nori wrap
[1568.08 - 1573.44] you can do the whole banana okay
[1571.28 - 1574.80] so i'll show you that version too so i'm
[1573.44 - 1577.92] going to cut these
[1574.80 - 1577.92] that's the potato one
[1579.04 - 1582.80] now you could use the whole banana in
[1580.56 - 1584.64] here which is another way i like to do
[1582.80 - 1587.12] it too i like to slice the banana
[1584.64 - 1587.76] but i also like to do a whole banana so
[1587.12 - 1590.72] i like to do
[1587.76 - 1592.40] both versions recipe in the book has the
[1590.72 - 1594.24] whole banana
[1592.40 - 1597.44] so i'm going to use some orange right
[1594.24 - 1598.64] here to moisten it up
[1597.44 - 1600.72] so our children are supposed to be
[1598.64 - 1605.36] really important but i noticed that
[1600.72 - 1608.24] health experts podcast doctors
[1605.36 - 1610.32] health influencers they're just pushing
[1608.24 - 1611.84] pushing and pushing the whole
[1610.32 - 1614.24] chocolate narrative they're pushing the
[1611.84 - 1615.84] whole hey it's plant medicine they're
[1614.24 - 1617.44] pushing the whole coffee drinks they're
[1615.84 - 1618.88] pushing the whole matcha tea
[1617.44 - 1621.44] and they're pushing down to pregnant
[1618.88 - 1623.68] women but nobody's thinking
[1621.44 - 1625.12] nobody's thinking about the babies when
[1623.68 - 1627.20] it comes down to that
[1625.12 - 1628.56] and that's where i'm kind of like that's
[1627.20 - 1629.92] where i'm like wait a minute are we
[1628.56 - 1631.68] losing it
[1629.92 - 1633.20] like are we losing it or something
[1631.68 - 1633.76] putting the whole banana in this one you
[1633.20 - 1635.20] guys
[1633.76 - 1640.00] because that's the way that's a great
[1635.20 - 1643.20] way to do it
[1640.00 - 1645.60] something to think about putting sprouts
[1643.20 - 1645.60] in here
[1645.84 - 1655.84] putting a little bit of cilantro in this
[1647.60 - 1655.84] one too
[1656.00 - 1659.76] and i think that's something we just
[1657.68 - 1660.96] like missed you guys are making some
[1659.76 - 1663.60] nori
[1660.96 - 1665.36] some banana nori wraps right here so i'm
[1663.60 - 1667.12] going to cut this one
[1665.36 - 1669.84] this is the one with the whole banana
[1667.12 - 1669.84] right here
[1671.68 - 1676.00] but then the breast feeding we got to
[1673.44 - 1677.92] think about the breast milk
[1676.00 - 1679.28] being pure and clean i like the heavy
[1677.92 - 1679.92] metal detox smoothie because it's
[1679.28 - 1682.48] removing
[1679.92 - 1684.24] nettles out of the breast milk that's
[1682.48 - 1685.04] why the heavy metal detox smoothie is so
[1684.24 - 1688.16] great
[1685.04 - 1690.16] so there you go
[1688.16 - 1691.36] that's the banana that's a whole banana
[1690.16 - 1694.40] right there using this one
[1691.36 - 1696.64] that's a banana nori wrap right there
[1694.40 - 1698.00] see so you got the sprouts in there got
[1696.64 - 1699.60] a little bit of cilantro in there you
[1698.00 - 1701.36] got the banana you got the green onion
[1699.60 - 1704.24] which is scallion right
[1701.36 - 1704.88] so you got that um yeah it's like sushi
[1704.24 - 1706.40] there you go
[1704.88 - 1708.16] with a banana and i'm gonna do it with
[1706.40 - 1709.92] potato too so
[1708.16 - 1712.00] there we go so this is really fun just
[1709.92 - 1714.32] making a bunch of these
[1712.00 - 1715.52] this is probably like i don't know this
[1714.32 - 1717.44] is this is a more
[1715.52 - 1718.96] fun one for me i like it i'm going to
[1717.44 - 1722.48] use some potato
[1718.96 - 1722.88] do some potato versions squeezing a
[1722.48 - 1726.72] little
[1722.88 - 1726.72] orange juice on top of this nori sheet
[1727.76 - 1731.92] so you want your breast milk to be
[1730.32 - 1733.60] really really clean
[1731.92 - 1735.84] you've got to look at what's with what
[1733.60 - 1739.28] you consume and what you're eating
[1735.84 - 1741.36] keep the caffeine out keep that out of
[1739.28 - 1742.72] the breast milk so the baby's not
[1741.36 - 1744.56] having problems because that's another
[1742.72 - 1747.76] thing too babies
[1744.56 - 1749.20] they'll get really really cranky
[1747.76 - 1751.76] when they're going through constant
[1749.20 - 1754.08] caffeine withdrawal each day
[1751.76 - 1756.96] and then yeah they're addicted to
[1754.08 - 1761.12] caffeine through the breast milk
[1756.96 - 1764.56] and won't sleep or will cry more
[1761.12 - 1766.08] be unhappy because that's the caffeine
[1764.56 - 1769.92] going on and that's the caffeine
[1766.08 - 1773.20] talking in the baby
[1769.92 - 1775.12] and almost every mom
[1773.20 - 1776.24] is drinking or eating some kind of
[1775.12 - 1779.44] caffeine product
[1776.24 - 1780.64] while breastfeeding no one's talking
[1779.44 - 1782.80] about it
[1780.64 - 1784.24] no one's talking about it no one says
[1782.80 - 1784.72] anything about it there's nothing out
[1784.24 - 1786.88] there
[1784.72 - 1788.48] health professionals don't talk about it
[1786.88 - 1789.84] no well what am i saying health
[1788.48 - 1790.64] professionals should say do more
[1789.84 - 1792.56] caffeine
[1790.64 - 1794.00] health professionals just say tell moms
[1792.56 - 1798.08] that are breastfeeding do more
[1794.00 - 1801.76] of it putting some dulls in here again
[1798.08 - 1808.16] make sure you do lots of chocolate
[1801.76 - 1809.28] so and it's really sad because it's
[1808.16 - 1811.28] going to guarantee
[1809.28 - 1813.28] that your baby grows up and then we'll
[1811.28 - 1815.60] be consuming caffeine more and more and
[1813.28 - 1815.60] more
[1816.16 - 1819.20] and then the cycle never gets broken
[1818.32 - 1822.24] ever
[1819.20 - 1822.56] anyway so you guys are making these talk
[1822.24 - 1823.92] about
[1822.56 - 1836.16] a couple bunch of things i want to read
[1823.92 - 1838.16] some comments too
[1836.16 - 1839.60] yeah and it's not it's not the doreen
[1838.16 - 1840.64] it's not the mom's faults at all of
[1839.60 - 1842.96] course not no way
[1840.64 - 1844.32] it's they want to do the best there is
[1842.96 - 1847.12] for their kids
[1844.32 - 1848.24] 100 they want to do the best they want
[1847.12 - 1851.44] to make sure
[1848.24 - 1855.04] the kids their their babies get the best
[1851.44 - 1857.12] there is all of it
[1855.04 - 1858.96] and then the whole thing with after
[1857.12 - 1860.88] pregnancy you get the hair loss
[1858.96 - 1862.56] so a lot of women suffer from hair
[1860.88 - 1864.32] thinning hair loss after pregnancies
[1862.56 - 1866.96] even if it's six months after
[1864.32 - 1868.40] child birth a year after child birth two
[1866.96 - 1871.04] months after childbirth
[1868.40 - 1872.80] during childbirth and because so much
[1871.04 - 1875.76] adrenaline
[1872.80 - 1877.12] was used and caffeine was stimulating so
[1875.76 - 1878.32] much adrenaline so you get the hair
[1877.12 - 1880.48] thinning
[1878.32 - 1882.00] and look i know i've been talking about
[1880.48 - 1883.44] caffeine a lot you guys would totally
[1882.00 - 1885.12] get it but there's so many different
[1883.44 - 1886.88] aspects of it that's why
[1885.12 - 1889.76] it's not just one thing it's just not
[1886.88 - 1890.16] one just not just one aspect or one part
[1889.76 - 1892.56] of
[1890.16 - 1894.64] the story with caffeine so i don't mean
[1892.56 - 1896.56] to caffeine you guys crazy but
[1894.64 - 1897.76] there's a reason for it because it's not
[1896.56 - 1899.84] just okay
[1897.76 - 1901.92] caffeine withdrawal and people shouldn't
[1899.84 - 1904.88] be doing it not good for them no
[1901.92 - 1906.88] it ages the skin the hair thins hair
[1904.88 - 1908.64] falls out for women there's that the sun
[1906.88 - 1910.32] spots all happen and they gotta all get
[1908.64 - 1911.76] the laser techniques the hormones get
[1910.32 - 1913.20] all in balance right
[1911.76 - 1914.88] so all that is coming out of the
[1913.20 - 1916.72] adrenals all that's you know all that
[1914.88 - 1919.52] it's because of the adrenals because of
[1916.72 - 1922.24] the caffeine but then the baby
[1919.52 - 1923.84] the whole baby protection protecting the
[1922.24 - 1926.00] baby and making sure
[1923.84 - 1927.52] your baby's safe make sure your baby has
[1926.00 - 1929.28] the best food and
[1927.52 - 1930.80] all of that well no one's thinking about
[1929.28 - 1934.40] the caffeine part there
[1930.80 - 1936.24] and and um and here's the thing
[1934.40 - 1938.24] coffee's just been getting stronger
[1936.24 - 1940.32] chocolate's been getting stronger
[1938.24 - 1942.88] and stronger so now we're in a place
[1940.32 - 1945.60] where espressos there's moms out there
[1942.88 - 1946.88] breastfeeding while doing espressos and
[1945.60 - 1949.84] because they're told to
[1946.88 - 1949.84] do it now
[1950.00 - 1953.36] they're told to do it i mean look you
[1951.68 - 1955.36] guys i could just forget it
[1953.36 - 1956.56] i could forget it never talk about it
[1955.36 - 1958.24] again how about that
[1956.56 - 1959.76] never tell anybody we just don't tell
[1958.24 - 1961.76] anybody
[1959.76 - 1962.96] let's keep it quiet not tell anybody not
[1961.76 - 1965.20] say anything okay
[1962.96 - 1966.80] and then just let women that are
[1965.20 - 1968.00] pregnant make sure they're eating lots
[1966.80 - 1969.36] of chocolate make sure they're doing
[1968.00 - 1970.80] lots of cacao make sure they're doing
[1969.36 - 1972.88] lots of coffee drinks and everything
[1970.80 - 1974.56] else and matcha tea while pregnant
[1972.88 - 1976.16] and then also breastfeeding we can do
[1974.56 - 1978.40] that we can keep it quiet
[1976.16 - 1980.24] i mean we right we don't have to go
[1978.40 - 1984.96] there
[1980.24 - 1987.84] but i just i just i can't do that
[1984.96 - 1991.04] um there's a lot of skin hacking going
[1987.84 - 1994.16] these days a lot of biohacking for skin
[1991.04 - 1994.56] you guys like it's all about hacking
[1994.16 - 1996.56] skin
[1994.56 - 1997.60] issues it's all about hacking skin
[1996.56 - 2000.48] problems
[1997.60 - 2002.16] you know acne scarring you know micro
[2000.48 - 2005.12] needling to try to heal
[2002.16 - 2005.92] acne scarring micro needling to try to
[2005.12 - 2009.76] get really good
[2005.92 - 2010.88] skin okay really abrasive peels skin
[2009.76 - 2014.48] peels
[2010.88 - 2018.40] right really abrasive exfoliations
[2014.48 - 2021.36] so there's a lot of that going on
[2018.40 - 2022.72] okay and so that's a big thing right now
[2021.36 - 2024.80] it's all about skin so
[2022.72 - 2026.80] you know you'll see on you'll see on the
[2024.80 - 2027.28] internet you'll see on youtube you'll
[2026.80 - 2030.08] see
[2027.28 - 2030.72] you know it's all about skin skin skin
[2030.08 - 2033.28] and
[2030.72 - 2034.40] social media and what can you do for
[2033.28 - 2035.92] your skin like
[2034.40 - 2037.68] what kind of what kind of treatment can
[2035.92 - 2038.64] you do for your skin skin on your your
[2037.68 - 2042.88] skin on your face
[2038.64 - 2046.64] in other areas and what's going on is
[2042.88 - 2048.32] that when you do like the micro needling
[2046.64 - 2049.68] we think that that's a good thing we're
[2048.32 - 2051.04] being taught that that's a good thing
[2049.68 - 2053.20] but it's actually not
[2051.04 - 2054.64] so if you guys always want to know like
[2053.20 - 2056.72] what i'm thinking or what
[2054.64 - 2057.84] you know my thoughts are about it all
[2056.72 - 2059.20] because i know you guys have a lot of
[2057.84 - 2061.68] questions and i've seen a question about
[2059.20 - 2063.60] that but i never answered it before
[2061.68 - 2065.36] and i haven't i didn't have a chance but
[2063.60 - 2067.52] here's how this here's how it works the
[2065.36 - 2070.48] micro needling
[2067.52 - 2071.68] injures the skin right so it injures it
[2070.48 - 2075.60] so then
[2071.68 - 2079.04] your skin your body's healing process
[2075.60 - 2080.64] tr amps up and it tries to heal that
[2079.04 - 2082.16] injury so you're doing the micro
[2080.64 - 2083.44] needling so you're doing that all on
[2082.16 - 2084.72] your face and micro needling and
[2083.44 - 2086.24] everything right
[2084.72 - 2087.76] and you're doing that and so you're
[2086.24 - 2092.08] injuring your skin you're
[2087.76 - 2095.12] injuring it in hopes that it heals
[2092.08 - 2098.00] and it comes out better right
[2095.12 - 2100.16] it's really not the reality of it that's
[2098.00 - 2103.44] not how it works
[2100.16 - 2106.00] what happens is that your body is over
[2103.44 - 2108.16] compensating in the moment to try to
[2106.00 - 2110.64] heal what you're doing for an injury
[2108.16 - 2112.64] so you're doing the micro needling and
[2110.64 - 2112.88] then your body tries to overcompensate
[2112.64 - 2114.56] and
[2112.88 - 2116.00] oh my god i got the body your body's
[2114.56 - 2117.44] like talking and like i gotta heal
[2116.00 - 2119.92] this your body goes into high gear to
[2117.44 - 2121.28] heal this and it takes a lot of reserves
[2119.92 - 2122.96] it takes a lot of physical reserves
[2121.28 - 2125.04] internally to go and try to heal the
[2122.96 - 2128.08] skin after you micro needle right
[2125.04 - 2131.44] and do really really harsh peels um
[2128.08 - 2133.76] but the problems in our skin is really
[2131.44 - 2135.04] within so it's deep inside of us that's
[2133.76 - 2137.92] where the real problems
[2135.04 - 2139.44] lie with skin it's not on the surface
[2137.92 - 2142.32] that's not where the problem
[2139.44 - 2144.08] lies it's within it's deeper that's
[2142.32 - 2146.72] where the real issues are
[2144.08 - 2148.32] and so we try a lot of different things
[2146.72 - 2149.36] we're always trying to hack our skin
[2148.32 - 2151.20] we're always trying to
[2149.36 - 2153.12] you know bio hacks and we're always
[2151.20 - 2155.12] hacking our skin and that's a big thing
[2153.12 - 2156.24] everybody's micro needling but what
[2155.12 - 2159.28] happens is with that
[2156.24 - 2161.60] is you end up with
[2159.28 - 2163.44] more difficult skin later on from all
[2161.60 - 2165.52] the micro needling
[2163.44 - 2166.88] so i thought it would kind of throw that
[2165.52 - 2168.80] throw that out to you guys so
[2166.88 - 2170.16] just in case i can look out for you and
[2168.80 - 2172.00] protect you guys because that's what i'm
[2170.16 - 2176.24] trying to do it's like
[2172.00 - 2176.24] i'm not i'm not doing this for
[2176.72 - 2181.20] not doing this because i enjoy it so
[2178.88 - 2183.44] much
[2181.20 - 2185.04] doing this because i feel i have to
[2183.44 - 2186.96] protect you guys that's how it's always
[2185.04 - 2188.96] been since i was four years old
[2186.96 - 2191.04] getting this information it's about
[2188.96 - 2192.80] protecting you guys right
[2191.04 - 2194.56] and if you're somebody into
[2192.80 - 2196.40] microneedling that's what you like to do
[2194.56 - 2199.44] you believe in it look
[2196.40 - 2201.04] just move move my thoughts aside and do
[2199.44 - 2204.48] it if you want to do
[2201.04 - 2207.92] but you're causing an injury that's
[2204.48 - 2209.68] forcing your body to then repair it
[2207.92 - 2211.84] so that's what's happening you're
[2209.68 - 2212.88] creating an injury forcing your body to
[2211.84 - 2217.04] repair it
[2212.88 - 2220.16] okay and so your body's gonna
[2217.04 - 2222.08] kill itself to overcompensate
[2220.16 - 2223.92] to try to repair the injuries you're
[2222.08 - 2226.40] creating in hopes that
[2223.92 - 2228.40] it ends up repairing any other day it's
[2226.40 - 2230.48] a great theory meaning
[2228.40 - 2231.84] that it can repair any other damage it's
[2230.48 - 2234.80] a great theory
[2231.84 - 2235.36] but what you get is you get this really
[2234.80 - 2237.28] mild
[2235.36 - 2239.12] mild mild scar tissue that starts to
[2237.28 - 2242.48] occur and that scar tissue
[2239.12 - 2244.08] gets kind of sleek okay so it gets kind
[2242.48 - 2245.28] of polished because that's what scar
[2244.08 - 2247.44] tissue can do
[2245.28 - 2249.68] when it's even like that so you're doing
[2247.44 - 2251.76] this even
[2249.68 - 2253.20] version of scar tissue it's not just one
[2251.76 - 2254.96] like say acne
[2253.20 - 2256.40] and you got a cystic acne and there's
[2254.96 - 2258.00] just one here and there's one here now
[2256.40 - 2260.24] you got a scar here and you got a scar
[2258.00 - 2261.84] here the micro needling first of all
[2260.24 - 2265.36] isn't that deep i know
[2261.84 - 2269.52] but it's doing it evenly everywhere
[2265.36 - 2272.96] but it's creating a very mild
[2269.52 - 2276.40] scar like a sheet like a scar
[2272.96 - 2277.20] sheet everywhere very mild one and over
[2276.40 - 2279.52] time
[2277.20 - 2283.20] that can get really really abrasive
[2279.52 - 2283.20] later on as the years go on
[2283.52 - 2285.84] now
[2286.16 - 2290.08] [Music]
[2287.92 - 2291.92] the goal for skin and to get skin to
[2290.08 - 2293.12] heal and to get skin as good as you want
[2291.92 - 2295.20] to get it and get skin
[2293.12 - 2296.64] really nice is you got to heal
[2295.20 - 2299.28] internally
[2296.64 - 2300.40] that's how it happens you gotta fix your
[2299.28 - 2302.32] liver
[2300.40 - 2304.80] you have to go after the very thing that
[2302.32 - 2306.24] creates cystic acne too
[2304.80 - 2308.24] those are the things that's where the
[2306.24 - 2309.20] eye has to be on the ball like that's it
[2308.24 - 2310.80] right there
[2309.20 - 2312.48] you guys are having any glitches on
[2310.80 - 2314.00] facebook just watch me on youtube right
[2312.48 - 2317.28] now i'm on youtube
[2314.00 - 2319.28] live right here because i heard people
[2317.28 - 2321.36] were having some glitches
[2319.28 - 2323.68] one of the ways to kill your skin is
[2321.36 - 2326.16] caffeine once again
[2323.68 - 2327.28] and look it's only so many times you
[2326.16 - 2327.76] want to hear it probably because you're
[2327.28 - 2330.00] like no
[2327.76 - 2331.60] no i can't quit oh no i heard it's good
[2330.00 - 2333.12] for me he's driving me crazy with this
[2331.60 - 2334.64] caffeine thing
[2333.12 - 2336.80] but if you care about your skin that's
[2334.64 - 2338.00] one thing right there that's a big deal
[2336.80 - 2339.44] the other thing is
[2338.00 - 2342.24] you know the foods you're doing like
[2339.44 - 2344.80] what foods vinegar is the skin killer
[2342.24 - 2347.12] not surfacely not surfacely like apple
[2344.80 - 2348.80] cider vinegar on the surface is actually
[2347.12 - 2350.80] okay for the skin
[2348.80 - 2351.84] because it can pull away any kind of
[2350.80 - 2353.92] corrosive
[2351.84 - 2355.12] material on the skin any kind of dead
[2353.92 - 2357.20] skin cells
[2355.12 - 2359.44] apple cider vinegar tends to help remove
[2357.20 - 2361.36] those any kind of toxins on your skin
[2359.44 - 2363.68] surface apple cider vinegar on your skin
[2361.36 - 2367.68] surface is actually helpful right
[2363.68 - 2369.44] diluted not straight but diluted
[2367.68 - 2370.80] all right but apple cider vinegar
[2369.44 - 2373.44] internally
[2370.80 - 2374.72] creates skin problems that's the other
[2373.44 - 2378.00] thing you guys are making the
[2374.72 - 2379.92] banana nori wraps potato nori wraps
[2378.00 - 2381.12] putting a little bit of cilantro
[2379.92 - 2382.96] a little bit of sprouts these are
[2381.12 - 2384.32] alfalfa sprouts right here i just want
[2382.96 - 2384.96] to show you i don't think i showed
[2384.32 - 2386.40] anybody
[2384.96 - 2388.72] exactly what they look like but there
[2386.40 - 2390.96] they are you guys know these the sprouts
[2388.72 - 2392.88] that's a cilantro these are potatoes
[2390.96 - 2393.52] this is some dolls i'm using a lot of
[2392.88 - 2395.60] dolls
[2393.52 - 2396.64] i really love it in these so using a
[2395.60 - 2398.24] little bit more
[2396.64 - 2399.76] i got the green onions which are over
[2398.24 - 2401.28] here which are scallions the green
[2399.76 - 2403.36] onions right
[2401.28 - 2405.12] i got that so i'm making these i'm going
[2403.36 - 2406.40] to roll this one up
[2405.12 - 2408.88] i think i got to put a little bit of
[2406.40 - 2411.92] dolls in here
[2408.88 - 2414.08] love you anthony what about botox then
[2411.92 - 2415.68] look i mean a lot of people everybody's
[2414.08 - 2417.84] doing it a lot not everybody but a lot
[2415.68 - 2420.40] of people are doing it
[2417.84 - 2422.48] um i worry about it i worry about the
[2420.40 - 2422.72] whole botulism thing because you know if
[2422.48 - 2425.84] it
[2422.72 - 2427.68] escapes get away if it gets away if it
[2425.84 - 2430.16] if it there's a lot of people that have
[2427.68 - 2432.40] been injured by it because it's because
[2430.16 - 2435.04] it's part of big pharma
[2432.40 - 2439.04] um anybody who really talks about their
[2435.04 - 2441.68] injuries about it it gets scrubbed
[2439.04 - 2443.28] so it gets it gets scrubbed on the
[2441.68 - 2445.20] internet
[2443.28 - 2448.00] you gotta search hard to find the people
[2445.20 - 2450.88] who have been injured from botox
[2448.00 - 2453.20] because it just if they disappear like
[2450.88 - 2454.56] they never existed on the internet
[2453.20 - 2456.48] so it's like they get this horrible
[2454.56 - 2456.96] reaction that happens their face blows
[2456.48 - 2458.72] up
[2456.96 - 2460.00] they're in the hospital for a month
[2458.72 - 2461.84] because the botox
[2460.00 - 2463.12] they can't use their they can't they
[2461.84 - 2465.36] can't talk right
[2463.12 - 2466.40] they're face troops they get the balls
[2465.36 - 2467.60] bell's palsy
[2466.40 - 2469.04] they get something wrong with kind of
[2467.60 - 2470.16] their shoulder and their arm because it
[2469.04 - 2471.84] runs down in there
[2470.16 - 2473.28] they get high fevers whatever it is they
[2471.84 - 2474.64] get and they're in the hospital the
[2473.28 - 2475.52] minute they go on social media and they
[2474.64 - 2477.20] try to sell
[2475.52 - 2479.20] they try to tell their story and tell
[2477.20 - 2479.52] their story they all of a sudden kind of
[2479.20 - 2481.68] like
[2479.52 - 2483.76] get nobody watching anymore and they all
[2481.68 - 2484.80] of a sudden just disappear over time
[2483.76 - 2486.80] and then they're gone they've been
[2484.80 - 2489.20] scrubbed they've been scrubbed off the
[2486.80 - 2489.20] internet
[2489.36 - 2493.60] because any kind of stuff like adverse
[2491.60 - 2495.28] stuff that happens with big pharma
[2493.60 - 2497.20] and you start complaining and you start
[2495.28 - 2498.96] freaking out you either have a guy with
[2497.20 - 2502.48] a black suit show up at your door and
[2498.96 - 2502.48] tell you never to talk about it again
[2503.12 - 2505.84] or you'll just get scrubbed off the
[2504.48 - 2507.28] internet is what really happens in the
[2505.84 - 2508.40] old days it was like somebody with a
[2507.28 - 2510.16] black suit would show up
[2508.40 - 2511.44] make sure you shut the hell up and never
[2510.16 - 2513.60] talk about
[2511.44 - 2516.00] never talk about your your big pharma
[2513.60 - 2516.00] injury
[2516.16 - 2522.08] this is really terrible all right guys
[2519.76 - 2525.76] i got some alfalfa sprouts right here i
[2522.08 - 2525.76] got some cilantro right here
[2527.92 - 2532.80] oh man so anyway as far as botox goes i
[2531.92 - 2534.48] mean i wouldn't
[2532.80 - 2536.48] personally i wouldn't do it but i know a
[2534.48 - 2539.92] lot of people do it and they they
[2536.48 - 2541.92] live by it i live by it i get it
[2539.92 - 2543.04] i'm not i'm not guess i'm not here to
[2541.92 - 2544.56] judge anybody
[2543.04 - 2546.16] it's like i'm just here to give you look
[2544.56 - 2548.00] you might be somebody
[2546.16 - 2549.52] that wants to know you shouldn't be on
[2548.00 - 2550.24] chocolate while pregnant you might be
[2549.52 - 2552.24] somebody
[2550.24 - 2553.52] okay and you might be really grateful or
[2552.24 - 2555.36] thankful that
[2553.52 - 2556.88] i i told you okay and then you might be
[2555.36 - 2559.12] somebody else who's like
[2556.88 - 2560.16] hell no i'm gonna do my chocolate you
[2559.12 - 2561.68] ain't gonna stop me
[2560.16 - 2563.68] baby or no baby you might be somebody
[2561.68 - 2566.32] like that and that's okay i'm not
[2563.68 - 2568.16] judging you it's not it's a hard world
[2566.32 - 2569.92] you know a lot of people need their
[2568.16 - 2572.08] chocolate get by
[2569.92 - 2573.68] you know and a lot of people can't think
[2572.08 - 2574.00] without their caffeine they can't even
[2573.68 - 2575.60] put
[2574.00 - 2576.88] a sentence together without it because
[2575.60 - 2578.40] they're struggling with problems and
[2576.88 - 2581.76] they're not in a place where they can
[2578.40 - 2581.76] fix it so easy right now
[2582.48 - 2586.64] so tell you guys something interesting
[2585.20 - 2587.76] you know when you get blood work
[2586.64 - 2590.16] a couple things i want to tell you about
[2587.76 - 2594.72] blood work okay one is
[2590.16 - 2596.32] ask your doctor okay to not
[2594.72 - 2599.04] when the when you do the blood work
[2596.32 - 2601.52] don't do so many vials of blood that's
[2599.04 - 2603.12] one thing right there
[2601.52 - 2605.12] because they'll just drain the life out
[2603.12 - 2606.48] of you like i've been i've been teaching
[2605.12 - 2608.72] doctors
[2606.48 - 2610.24] two or three vials that's it you get
[2608.72 - 2611.76] another blood test if you want to test
[2610.24 - 2613.68] for other things and you do another two
[2611.76 - 2615.68] or three vials don't do six vials don't
[2613.68 - 2616.80] do five vials don't do seven vials don't
[2615.68 - 2619.28] do 10 vials
[2616.80 - 2620.56] don't do 12 vials don't do 14 don't do
[2619.28 - 2623.20] 26 vials
[2620.56 - 2626.72] no yeah guess what some doctors they'll
[2623.20 - 2626.72] pull 26 vials out of people
[2626.88 - 2630.40] um you got to remember this when you're
[2628.80 - 2631.92] getting blood tests and i want to talk
[2630.40 - 2633.44] about this about blood a bunch of
[2631.92 - 2635.28] different stuff about blood
[2633.44 - 2637.04] because i really haven't covered blood
[2635.28 - 2638.32] enough and i want to really cover i'm
[2637.04 - 2639.44] going to cover what i can now but
[2638.32 - 2641.28] there's it's going to probably take a
[2639.44 - 2643.04] couple of cooking sessions
[2641.28 - 2644.24] to cover all the blood stuff right so
[2643.04 - 2644.88] i'm going to give you a couple of pieces
[2644.24 - 2646.80] with it
[2644.88 - 2649.12] i'm making potato nori wraps i'm going
[2646.80 - 2652.00] to cut more potato right here
[2649.12 - 2655.12] okay first of all ask your doctor to
[2652.00 - 2655.12] keep it minimal
[2655.20 - 2659.84] less blood drawn
[2658.56 - 2661.12] if he says well i'm not going to be able
[2659.84 - 2662.64] to test for this and this and this and
[2661.12 - 2664.80] this and this say can you cut it in half
[2662.64 - 2667.84] and test for those another day i come in
[2664.80 - 2670.24] write it up do it
[2667.84 - 2671.44] it's one thing because when you're sick
[2670.24 - 2672.96] and you've got chronic illness and
[2671.44 - 2674.56] you've got any kind of low grade viral
[2672.96 - 2674.88] stuff if you're not well whatever that
[2674.56 - 2677.04] is
[2674.88 - 2678.16] that you're going through the more blood
[2677.04 - 2680.00] taken at once
[2678.16 - 2681.60] you just lost your immune system it's
[2680.00 - 2684.56] gone out the door
[2681.60 - 2685.20] bye gone one shot you're getting your
[2684.56 - 2686.72] blood work
[2685.20 - 2689.04] they're drawing your blood well there's
[2686.72 - 2689.44] one vial boom okay that's okay two vials
[2689.04 - 2691.60] boom
[2689.44 - 2692.80] three vials boom four boom here's your
[2691.60 - 2694.96] immune system your white count
[2692.80 - 2697.84] neutrophils basal cells monocytes your
[2694.96 - 2698.96] lymphocytes all going out that's it so
[2697.84 - 2701.76] your immune system is
[2698.96 - 2704.16] being removed and if you're viral with
[2701.76 - 2706.64] epstein-barr you got ra hashimoto's
[2704.16 - 2708.16] ms you got lupus you got whatever you
[2706.64 - 2709.20] got going on it could be eczema
[2708.16 - 2712.32] psoriasis
[2709.20 - 2714.32] anything reproductive problems then your
[2712.32 - 2715.84] body has to build up and recreate a
[2714.32 - 2717.68] brand new immune system for your
[2715.84 - 2721.60] bloodstream and in that
[2717.68 - 2724.00] moment those bugs streptococcus
[2721.60 - 2725.20] epstein-barr whatever are going to creep
[2724.00 - 2726.32] up they can creep
[2725.20 - 2728.88] up because your immune system was
[2726.32 - 2731.12] removed so you want to do minimal
[2728.88 - 2732.08] like okay can i get three vials not six
[2731.12 - 2734.40] or eight
[2732.08 - 2735.76] and then i'll come back and you then
[2734.40 - 2738.72] test for the other things and i'll get
[2735.76 - 2738.72] three more vials
[2742.16 - 2745.60] that's really powerful information get
[2744.00 - 2747.44] two vials
[2745.60 - 2749.12] and the other thing too if you can't go
[2747.44 - 2751.12] that route your doctor's like no i need
[2749.12 - 2752.96] five aisles i need six vials of blood i
[2751.12 - 2756.24] need seven vials of blood
[2752.96 - 2758.40] ask them if you can do half vials of
[2756.24 - 2761.44] blood because guess what the blood
[2758.40 - 2762.96] the the just so you know um when they
[2761.44 - 2764.40] test for blood when they test your blood
[2762.96 - 2767.20] they throw it all away
[2764.40 - 2768.32] they take this much that much out of a
[2767.20 - 2770.24] vial
[2768.32 - 2771.60] that much most of the time and they
[2770.24 - 2774.48] throw away all your blood
[2771.60 - 2776.08] it all gets thrown away okay so it's a
[2774.48 - 2778.56] scam too
[2776.08 - 2780.72] so ask your doctor can you go with half
[2778.56 - 2782.40] vials of blood
[2780.72 - 2785.28] send it to the blood testing place the
[2782.40 - 2788.48] labs with half of them filled
[2785.28 - 2790.00] this way if you do three half vials it's
[2788.48 - 2793.04] only really what
[2790.00 - 2794.96] one and a half if you do five half files
[2793.04 - 2796.24] you're only what two and a half or
[2794.96 - 2798.88] whatever
[2796.24 - 2802.56] you guys i'm doing some i hope my math
[2798.88 - 2805.52] is right
[2802.56 - 2805.52] never went to college
[2806.32 - 2812.72] was too busy helping people heal
[2809.92 - 2815.76] couldn't do it was way too busy had too
[2812.72 - 2817.76] many people knocking on my door
[2815.76 - 2819.84] working on saving lives all these years
[2817.76 - 2823.44] it just didn't have the time to go to
[2819.84 - 2824.72] school didn't have time to go to college
[2823.44 - 2827.68] but i can tell you how to protect
[2824.72 - 2830.32] yourself and
[2827.68 - 2832.72] and give you books that have already
[2830.32 - 2835.20] saved lots of lives you guys i'm making
[2832.72 - 2836.72] the banana nori wraps right here there
[2835.20 - 2839.20] it is medical medium
[2836.72 - 2841.68] revised and expanded new edition find it
[2839.20 - 2844.32] on amazon
[2841.68 - 2845.76] um another thing too with blood testing
[2844.32 - 2847.52] which is interesting so i'm just talking
[2845.76 - 2850.24] about that part let's get some
[2847.52 - 2851.92] dolls right here so i gotta i gotta
[2850.24 - 2853.12] cover some more blood information if you
[2851.92 - 2853.92] guys are interested you guys get blood
[2853.12 - 2857.04] work all the time
[2853.92 - 2859.84] you guys get blood work so i got a
[2857.04 - 2859.84] little bit more
[2861.44 - 2865.36] okay the labs are lying lizzy lou the
[2863.84 - 2866.80] labs say they can't run the blood work
[2865.36 - 2872.80] unless the vials are full
[2866.80 - 2875.20] they're lying they can they actually can
[2872.80 - 2877.04] how do i know doctors tell me how do i
[2875.20 - 2879.84] know paint doctors patients
[2877.04 - 2880.40] that i've known through doctors have
[2879.84 - 2884.00] have
[2880.40 - 2886.08] insisted on half files and the labs have
[2884.00 - 2887.52] run it
[2886.08 - 2889.84] so you just have to fight for it a
[2887.52 - 2889.84] little bit
[2890.08 - 2894.48] making a pile of these wow okay so
[2893.20 - 2896.96] another thing too is
[2894.48 - 2898.24] you can get a blood test for something
[2896.96 - 2900.48] like cortisol
[2898.24 - 2902.32] get blood blood tests to check your
[2900.48 - 2903.84] adrenals and cortisol right
[2902.32 - 2905.68] and an hour later it's going to be
[2903.84 - 2907.52] entirely different than when you had it
[2905.68 - 2910.00] tested that moment
[2907.52 - 2911.44] blood tests are so inconsistent that's
[2910.00 - 2915.12] another thing
[2911.44 - 2917.28] really interesting about blood tests
[2915.12 - 2918.72] you got to take sometimes a lot of blood
[2917.28 - 2920.24] tests and a lot of different tests with
[2918.72 - 2923.44] the grain of salt
[2920.24 - 2925.28] testing changes constantly within the
[2923.44 - 2926.24] hour within a day if you go to bathroom
[2925.28 - 2928.00] before you
[2926.24 - 2929.12] get your blood test or go to bathroom
[2928.00 - 2931.84] after you get your blood this is
[2929.12 - 2931.84] entirely different
[2934.00 - 2937.20] i will barber says i will ask about half
[2936.64 - 2939.52] files
[2937.20 - 2941.20] definitely ask about half vials because
[2939.52 - 2943.12] if they're taking that much blood
[2941.20 - 2945.04] it gets us sicker and sicker over time
[2943.12 - 2947.12] so let me just let me just be straight
[2945.04 - 2949.20] out about this this is critical to know
[2947.12 - 2950.88] the more blood we get taken and the more
[2949.20 - 2951.36] blood we get taken the more blood we get
[2950.88 - 2954.48] taken
[2951.36 - 2957.04] the sicker we get you know i call the
[2954.48 - 2960.48] system the ultimate vampire
[2957.04 - 2963.28] they don't do it right they don't
[2960.48 - 2963.92] do it carefully they suck the life out
[2963.28 - 2965.68] of us they
[2963.92 - 2968.48] rob our immune systems with the blood
[2965.68 - 2969.28] tests and they don't they're not careful
[2968.48 - 2971.68] about it
[2969.28 - 2973.36] they're not and people get sicker who
[2971.68 - 2975.20] are viral and chronically ill and they
[2973.36 - 2976.72] get sicker and sicker and sicker because
[2975.20 - 2978.80] of it
[2976.72 - 2980.24] so you want to be careful and ask about
[2978.80 - 2981.12] half files if you can't get the half
[2980.24 - 2982.56] vials
[2981.12 - 2984.64] your doctor doesn't want to do it or
[2982.56 - 2986.96] something's going on there then ask for
[2984.64 - 2990.08] less vials drawn
[2986.96 - 2990.96] and then go back again for other tests
[2990.08 - 2993.04] so it's not
[2990.96 - 2995.68] all those done at once and do another
[2993.04 - 2998.48] potato roll up right here
[2995.68 - 3000.72] and the body is always compensating too
[2998.48 - 3002.56] all the time we've got to remember this
[3000.72 - 3003.76] it's always compensating so the blood
[3002.56 - 3005.12] tests are picking up the body
[3003.76 - 3007.20] compensating all the time
[3005.12 - 3008.64] that's something to keep in mind as well
[3007.20 - 3010.40] you go through a stressful event your
[3008.64 - 3012.80] body's compensating
[3010.40 - 3013.68] it's always doing that your body's if
[3012.80 - 3015.04] you're um
[3013.68 - 3017.12] getting deficient in something your
[3015.04 - 3019.60] body's compensating
[3017.12 - 3021.12] it's always doing that so it's really
[3019.60 - 3022.56] that's something to keep in mind all on
[3021.12 - 3023.12] its own i want to go into that a little
[3022.56 - 3027.68] bit more
[3023.12 - 3029.28] too it's interesting
[3027.68 - 3032.36] okay guys putting a little bit more dols
[3029.28 - 3035.46] in here rolling up another one
[3032.36 - 3035.46] [Applause]
[3036.48 - 3040.56] educating myself says also explains
[3038.72 - 3042.24] immune lowering
[3040.56 - 3044.40] during menstruation which is medical
[3042.24 - 3046.64] medium information
[3044.40 - 3047.92] i put that out years ago immune system
[3046.64 - 3050.64] lowers during
[3047.92 - 3050.64] menstruation
[3053.28 - 3061.60] publish first medical medium books
[3056.88 - 3065.36] um yeah it totally explains that
[3061.60 - 3066.88] exactly the amount of medical
[3065.36 - 3068.72] medium information that's gotten out
[3066.88 - 3069.60] there over the years with no science
[3068.72 - 3073.20] behind it
[3069.60 - 3075.28] none at all but it becomes law out there
[3073.20 - 3076.88] it's you know and then but you'll hear
[3075.28 - 3078.00] everybody where's your science where's
[3076.88 - 3080.16] your signs where's your science
[3078.00 - 3082.56] so here's how it works too is like your
[3080.16 - 3083.60] body's over compensating constantly for
[3082.56 - 3086.88] everything we do
[3083.60 - 3088.16] that we shouldn't do everything we do
[3086.88 - 3089.20] that we shouldn't do our bodies
[3088.16 - 3091.20] overcompensating
[3089.20 - 3092.80] non-stop right you drink caffeine our
[3091.20 - 3095.20] bodies overcompensating
[3092.80 - 3096.16] right there we challenge our body it
[3095.20 - 3100.16] compensates
[3096.16 - 3102.32] okay we do an ice cold plunge
[3100.16 - 3104.08] our bodies freaking out goes into crisis
[3102.32 - 3105.52] and tries to find homeostasis and
[3104.08 - 3107.84] overcompensates
[3105.52 - 3108.96] our body is constantly trying to find
[3107.84 - 3111.52] that homeostasis
[3108.96 - 3112.40] all the time at every moment anywhere
[3111.52 - 3114.64] anyhow
[3112.40 - 3116.48] and and when they take blood they
[3114.64 - 3118.16] they've never accounted for that really
[3116.48 - 3119.52] that our body's constantly trying to
[3118.16 - 3120.88] find a balance
[3119.52 - 3123.04] so when they take blood they don't
[3120.88 - 3125.52] realize it's much deeper than what it
[3123.04 - 3127.20] really is that you read on the results
[3125.52 - 3128.56] too i'm not saying all the results are
[3127.20 - 3130.64] wrong and that's not it
[3128.56 - 3131.68] it's just that our bodies are in it's a
[3130.64 - 3133.76] working process
[3131.68 - 3135.60] every day to overcompensate everything
[3133.76 - 3136.72] we're doing so if we got too much fat in
[3135.60 - 3138.16] our bloodstream our body's
[3136.72 - 3140.80] overcompensating by really
[3138.16 - 3142.96] releasing more adrenaline to thin it out
[3140.80 - 3144.64] um if we're under a lot of stress
[3142.96 - 3146.00] our bodies like over compensating to
[3144.64 - 3148.64] deal with the stress
[3146.00 - 3149.12] and it's just it's this constant tug and
[3148.64 - 3151.52] pull
[3149.12 - 3152.40] tug and pull that's why blood tests are
[3151.52 - 3154.24] not the same
[3152.40 - 3156.96] an hour later it's why blood tests are
[3154.24 - 3157.52] not the same two hours later or a day
[3156.96 - 3160.40] later
[3157.52 - 3160.96] they're different i'm gonna do a banana
[3160.40 - 3166.00] right now
[3160.96 - 3167.84] this is the next one i'm gonna do
[3166.00 - 3169.36] so you got to take the average you know
[3167.84 - 3170.72] that's what they really should do they
[3169.36 - 3173.28] should be like i'm going to put a whole
[3170.72 - 3175.04] banana in here like this
[3173.28 - 3177.76] they should take the average of the test
[3175.04 - 3180.00] like hormone test in the morning
[3177.76 - 3181.92] come back the next day in the afternoon
[3180.00 - 3183.52] get another hormone test then
[3181.92 - 3185.68] you get that blood run you get that
[3183.52 - 3186.64] blood run the lab and then what you have
[3185.68 - 3188.48] here is
[3186.64 - 3190.96] you go somewhere you'll see the numbers
[3188.48 - 3190.96] are different
[3193.68 - 3196.80] or you get a blood test in the morning
[3195.20 - 3198.48] one day and then a week later you get a
[3196.80 - 3199.84] blood test in the morning that next day
[3198.48 - 3203.20] and then next a week later and you'll
[3199.84 - 3203.20] see why are the numbers different
[3205.52 - 3209.68] why are the numbers constantly different
[3208.56 - 3211.04] because you might have had a little
[3209.68 - 3211.84] stress in your life maybe you had
[3211.04 - 3213.28] something happen
[3211.84 - 3215.04] maybe something's going on maybe you're
[3213.28 - 3216.96] eating differently maybe you had
[3215.04 - 3219.76] something you shouldn't have eaten
[3216.96 - 3220.84] maybe something like that the body tries
[3219.76 - 3223.68] to compensate
[3220.84 - 3226.88] constantly the numbers change your
[3223.68 - 3229.76] body's trying to find homeostasis
[3226.88 - 3229.76] and that's how it works
[3232.64 - 3235.36] i made a really big one right here so
[3234.00 - 3237.12] when i cut it in half you'll see i mean
[3235.36 - 3238.40] they become nori wraps when you make
[3237.12 - 3239.28] them bigger and that's what the recipe
[3238.40 - 3240.88] calls for
[3239.28 - 3242.32] it really calls for this so what i'm
[3240.88 - 3244.80] gonna do i'm gonna cut this one in half
[3242.32 - 3244.80] like this
[3245.60 - 3250.72] so that's the nori that's the nori wrap
[3249.28 - 3252.88] there's a full banana in there you got
[3250.72 - 3254.32] the sprouts you got the cilantro
[3252.88 - 3256.08] you got a little bit of the doll
[3254.32 - 3257.28] stripped in there and you got the green
[3256.08 - 3259.68] onion you see
[3257.28 - 3260.80] now i'm going to cut them also small too
[3259.68 - 3261.44] so i'm going to do that as well i'm
[3260.80 - 3263.68] going to cut them
[3261.44 - 3264.56] into little circles like i like to do
[3263.68 - 3265.84] and fill the plate
[3264.56 - 3268.48] fill the plate up and that's where i'm
[3265.84 - 3268.48] going next
[3271.60 - 3273.84] yep
[3276.84 - 3281.12] um you can't test for heavy metals
[3280.32 - 3282.88] through blood work
[3281.12 - 3284.88] because that's not going to work because
[3282.88 - 3286.88] heavy metals sit and saturate inside the
[3284.88 - 3287.92] organ tissue so toxic heavy metals sit
[3286.88 - 3289.44] inside the brain
[3287.92 - 3291.04] they sit inside the glial cells the
[3289.44 - 3293.52] brain tissue they sit
[3291.04 - 3295.28] they sit deep inside the brain so what
[3293.52 - 3298.00] happens is they sit deep inside the
[3295.28 - 3300.56] liver they sit deep inside our organs so
[3298.00 - 3302.16] hey do i have toxic metals or not i
[3300.56 - 3303.28] don't know let me go get a blood test at
[3302.16 - 3304.88] the doctor's office
[3303.28 - 3306.64] and the doctor the doctor might be like
[3304.88 - 3308.16] hey you got little traces of it but i
[3306.64 - 3310.64] don't think you have it bad
[3308.16 - 3312.24] those traces in your bloodstream are
[3310.64 - 3315.84] from new exposure
[3312.24 - 3318.00] brand new exposure toxic heavy metals
[3315.84 - 3318.88] old exposure sit inside your brain
[3318.00 - 3320.96] forever
[3318.88 - 3322.56] but new exposure on a daily level will
[3320.96 - 3326.40] show up on the blood test and it might
[3322.56 - 3326.40] not even be perfect on that level too
[3326.72 - 3330.16] carmen says i have too much calcium in
[3329.12 - 3334.00] my blood
[3330.16 - 3336.16] what can i do i mean first of all
[3334.00 - 3337.68] if first of all i would i would
[3336.16 - 3339.12] definitely start shifting things with
[3337.68 - 3339.76] your diet if you have too much calcium
[3339.12 - 3342.16] in your blood
[3339.76 - 3343.52] so it starts shifting things there um
[3342.16 - 3345.60] start cleaning things up
[3343.52 - 3346.88] are you doing any eggs get rid of those
[3345.60 - 3348.56] eggs you can ask your doctor about that
[3346.88 - 3349.84] see what's right for you but i i would
[3348.56 - 3351.12] if that was me and i had too much
[3349.84 - 3352.88] calcium in my blood
[3351.12 - 3354.16] i would be getting rid of eggs that
[3352.88 - 3354.88] would be something i would do right
[3354.16 - 3357.04] there
[3354.88 - 3359.04] guys i'm going to take two nori's
[3357.04 - 3362.16] together and cut them
[3359.04 - 3363.60] in pieces i would get rid of eggs i
[3362.16 - 3365.44] would get rid of dairy products
[3363.60 - 3366.80] i would keep the caffeine and chocolate
[3365.44 - 3368.24] out because here's what what happens
[3366.80 - 3370.48] when you do coffee
[3368.24 - 3371.76] it sucks the calcium out of your bones
[3370.48 - 3373.36] and therefore you end up with the
[3371.76 - 3376.16] calcium in your blood
[3373.36 - 3376.64] so when you do caffeine of any kind it's
[3376.16 - 3380.16] the
[3376.64 - 3385.04] caffeine caffeine that draws the calcium
[3380.16 - 3386.96] out of your bones to act as a buffer
[3385.04 - 3388.88] right same thing with apple cider
[3386.96 - 3392.88] vinegar apple cider vinegar
[3388.88 - 3394.16] pulls it pulls calcium out of your teeth
[3392.88 - 3395.92] out of your bones
[3394.16 - 3397.84] same thing with any kind of vinegar it
[3395.92 - 3399.76] pulls calcium out of your bones
[3397.84 - 3401.52] get rid of all the vinegars gone get rid
[3399.76 - 3403.44] of all your caffeine gone
[3401.52 - 3404.80] get rid of the eggs the dairy products
[3403.44 - 3407.44] gone and then
[3404.80 - 3408.88] give it a little time and then see what
[3407.44 - 3409.76] happens there i mean that's what i would
[3408.88 - 3412.16] do if it was me
[3409.76 - 3414.96] i'm cutting these right here cutting two
[3412.16 - 3417.12] at a time like this
[3414.96 - 3418.08] you can make these thick and bigger
[3417.12 - 3421.44] pieces
[3418.08 - 3421.44] you can make them skinny
[3421.60 - 3424.96] i'll show you guys i'll plate them up
[3428.16 - 3433.84] hair test for metals don't work either
[3430.88 - 3433.84] keep that in mind as well
[3433.92 - 3440.40] those are not great indicators either
[3437.20 - 3443.84] so that's something to know there
[3440.40 - 3443.84] so i'm going to plate these up here
[3444.16 - 3447.92] i'm going to do a bunch of them in these
[3445.60 - 3452.80] plates i like doing these little
[3447.92 - 3452.80] circles like this so
[3454.56 - 3457.84] so that's something also to keep in mind
[3456.08 - 3461.84] there that hair testing isn't
[3457.84 - 3461.84] isn't a great indicator as well
[3462.64 - 3466.94] i'm noticing something is i get it
[3464.72 - 3468.24] everybody wants to be spiritual
[3466.94 - 3471.28] [Music]
[3468.24 - 3474.24] these days but how come if
[3471.28 - 3475.04] how can we want well how come scientific
[3474.24 - 3477.60] studies are so
[3475.04 - 3477.60] important
[3478.32 - 3483.84] if we're so spiritual why do we need a
[3481.44 - 3486.80] scientific study so bad
[3483.84 - 3488.56] in order to drink celery juice or in
[3486.80 - 3491.44] order to
[3488.56 - 3493.04] do something that's healing somebody
[3491.44 - 3495.52] like what we're doing here
[3493.04 - 3496.32] like why do you need you know a
[3495.52 - 3499.44] scientific
[3496.32 - 3501.12] study where's your science on that
[3499.44 - 3504.08] information anthony where is it
[3501.12 - 3507.44] okay well that's funny because i thought
[3504.08 - 3507.44] you were a spiritual person
[3507.60 - 3510.80] everybody's acting so spiritual i've
[3509.12 - 3511.68] seen people in yoga studios a friend of
[3510.80 - 3514.16] mine told me
[3511.68 - 3515.68] a whole bunch of people in his yoga
[3514.16 - 3517.12] studio
[3515.68 - 3519.12] is before the whole thing happened
[3517.12 - 3520.64] recently with the plague we've been
[3519.12 - 3523.52] dealing with
[3520.64 - 3526.64] he said there's like they're really
[3523.52 - 3526.64] spiritual people
[3527.76 - 3530.96] but for some reason they need a
[3529.28 - 3533.28] scientific study
[3530.96 - 3535.84] on everything like anything my friend
[3533.28 - 3537.92] said to them in the yoga studio
[3535.84 - 3540.08] anything my friend said he's a doctor
[3537.92 - 3545.12] friend he said you know medical medium
[3540.08 - 3547.44] says that um you know
[3545.12 - 3549.36] when you when when you have your cycle
[3547.44 - 3550.80] your immune system drops eighty percent
[3549.36 - 3552.88] of your immune system goes to your
[3550.80 - 3554.80] reproductive system while 20 percent
[3552.88 - 3556.72] is left to fend for you on everywhere
[3554.80 - 3558.24] else and they go where's the scientific
[3556.72 - 3560.88] study on that and these are people that
[3558.24 - 3563.76] are super spiritual he said
[3560.88 - 3563.76] super spiritual
[3568.32 - 3572.00] and he's like this is confusing why is
[3571.36 - 3575.04] everybody
[3572.00 - 3575.04] so spiritual
[3575.76 - 3578.96] but yet they they won't do they won't do
[3578.24 - 3580.88] anything
[3578.96 - 3584.64] unless science involved in some way or
[3580.88 - 3584.64] they think science is involved in some
[3584.84 - 3591.68] way
[3587.44 - 3591.68] is it hypocritical what is that
[3594.72 - 3601.12] especially since many of the people in
[3598.16 - 3603.52] the yoga studio had chronic illness
[3601.12 - 3605.60] like autoimmune and science and research
[3603.52 - 3607.04] hasn't fixed it and no scientific study
[3605.60 - 3610.40] fixed it
[3607.04 - 3611.28] and there they are doing yoga and they
[3610.40 - 3614.08] got
[3611.28 - 3616.08] a little bit of fatigue they got some
[3614.08 - 3618.64] hashimoto's and they're they're they're
[3616.08 - 3621.60] at the yoga center doing yoga
[3618.64 - 3623.68] and science and research studies hasn't
[3621.60 - 3626.16] fixed their hashimoto's on any level
[3623.68 - 3627.36] but for some reason they need a study in
[3626.16 - 3628.00] order to do something when they're
[3627.36 - 3631.28] supposed to be so
[3628.00 - 3633.52] spiritual there's the norris
[3631.28 - 3636.64] right there i cut them in little pieces
[3633.52 - 3636.64] i'm gonna cut some more next
[3640.84 - 3645.28] uh
[3643.76 - 3647.68] another thing too is everybody thinks
[3645.28 - 3648.96] they're a health expert
[3647.68 - 3651.36] i don't mind if they think they're a
[3648.96 - 3654.88] health expert that's fine but
[3651.36 - 3656.56] stop burning all that toxic incense
[3654.88 - 3658.72] that's poisoning the people around you
[3656.56 - 3659.68] or your family stop burning the scented
[3658.72 - 3663.28] candles
[3659.68 - 3663.76] with all the chemical company toxins in
[3663.28 - 3667.60] it
[3663.76 - 3671.44] they're killing people and
[3667.60 - 3674.72] if you want to be a health expert
[3671.44 - 3675.36] and a spiritual expert i just i would
[3674.72 - 3678.64] suggest
[3675.36 - 3680.40] maybe kind of like i don't know getting
[3678.64 - 3681.76] in touch with what you're doing a little
[3680.40 - 3684.56] bit
[3681.76 - 3686.32] maybe don't burn those dangerous scented
[3684.56 - 3689.52] candles
[3686.32 - 3698.08] poisoning yourself poisoning your lungs
[3689.52 - 3701.60] breaking down your immune system
[3698.08 - 3702.56] one's a no-brainer maybe those chemicals
[3701.60 - 3704.00] are dangerous
[3702.56 - 3706.00] and if you have children i mean you
[3704.00 - 3708.72] shouldn't be burning scented candles
[3706.00 - 3710.80] if you have children and you look i'm
[3708.72 - 3711.20] not look not judging anybody it's just
[3710.80 - 3713.84] that
[3711.20 - 3715.44] i want to help people because when you
[3713.84 - 3716.32] learn these things you're like okay wait
[3715.44 - 3720.64] a minute
[3716.32 - 3723.28] okay whoa yeah i need to be on that
[3720.64 - 3724.32] same thing with perfumes and clothes
[3723.28 - 3727.84] this stuff is so
[3724.32 - 3729.76] toxic they're chemical soups
[3727.84 - 3731.36] and they they go into the sinuses and
[3729.76 - 3733.84] they stick to the sinus
[3731.36 - 3735.28] cavities and they actually find their
[3733.84 - 3737.12] way into the brain
[3735.28 - 3738.56] through the sinus cavities scented
[3737.12 - 3740.24] candles the chemicals that send to
[3738.56 - 3742.80] candles find their way
[3740.24 - 3745.36] into your brain through your sinus
[3742.80 - 3745.36] cavities
[3746.64 - 3750.48] see a lot of health gurus these days
[3749.04 - 3753.36] lighting their scented candles
[3750.48 - 3755.84] and burning incense that's treated with
[3753.36 - 3755.84] chemicals
[3756.00 - 3758.88] and they're telling everybody this is
[3757.28 - 3760.16] what you need to do you need to do this
[3758.88 - 3762.24] you need to do that
[3760.16 - 3765.52] you need to sit in your sauna for an
[3762.24 - 3767.52] hour with the highest heat
[3765.52 - 3769.12] until you go into hypothermia basically
[3767.52 - 3770.56] and your adrenals then spill out a
[3769.12 - 3772.72] lifetime of adrenaline and then you're
[3770.56 - 3774.08] high afterwards
[3772.72 - 3775.60] and then years down the road you get
[3774.08 - 3777.44] broken down from it and everything
[3775.60 - 3778.88] starts falling apart and nobody knows it
[3777.44 - 3781.20] was from doing too hot
[3778.88 - 3782.80] too hot and too long saunas and then
[3781.20 - 3784.56] caffeine all day make sure you do your
[3782.80 - 3786.32] plant medicine chocolate
[3784.56 - 3787.92] all the health gurus are like do your
[3786.32 - 3789.44] plant medicine chocolate make sure you
[3787.92 - 3797.52] do it make sure you get lots of it so
[3789.44 - 3800.32] good for you science says
[3797.52 - 3803.04] and how can you really be spiritual if
[3800.32 - 3807.44] you need vices
[3803.04 - 3809.04] look a lot of people need vices to
[3807.44 - 3812.08] survive and get through the day
[3809.04 - 3813.60] never going to judge anybody on that i
[3812.08 - 3817.12] know life isn't easy
[3813.60 - 3820.32] life can be really hard really difficult
[3817.12 - 3822.40] but but just
[3820.32 - 3823.44] you know try to realize there's a lot of
[3822.40 - 3826.40] people out there
[3823.44 - 3828.00] that got it real easy real easy it's a
[3826.40 - 3829.76] lot of people you guys out there got it
[3828.00 - 3830.48] easy everything's paid for everything's
[3829.76 - 3833.36] good
[3830.48 - 3836.16] maybe they came for money fine not
[3833.36 - 3836.16] faulting anybody
[3836.84 - 3841.52] but
[3839.28 - 3843.04] whatever they've never had a difficult
[3841.52 - 3844.32] challenge yet maybe they're still
[3843.04 - 3846.16] young and they haven't been faced with
[3844.32 - 3849.04] any difficult challenges
[3846.16 - 3851.28] but what's their excuse for holding on
[3849.04 - 3853.92] to all their vices
[3851.28 - 3854.96] and but claiming they're spiritual at
[3853.92 - 3858.88] the same time
[3854.96 - 3861.12] look i don't mind if you do that
[3858.88 - 3863.04] it's just that to grow sometimes we have
[3861.12 - 3865.20] to let go of some things we have to be
[3863.04 - 3866.48] without sometimes sometimes we have to
[3865.20 - 3869.76] be without
[3866.48 - 3872.80] a vice one that's hurting us
[3869.76 - 3875.20] you know how spiritually connected can
[3872.80 - 3877.20] we get if we're so jacked up on a drug
[3875.20 - 3879.20] that the caffeine industry
[3877.20 - 3880.56] wants us on for the rest of our life so
[3879.20 - 3882.80] they get rich they don't care what
[3880.56 - 3884.72] happens to us
[3882.80 - 3888.24] spiritual growth is about being without
[3884.72 - 3889.60] sometimes maybe letting go of ice
[3888.24 - 3891.36] and then you wonder down the road while
[3889.60 - 3892.80] your body's falling apart no one's going
[3891.36 - 3894.88] to tell you no one's going to say it was
[3892.80 - 3896.72] all that caffeine all these years
[3894.88 - 3900.56] you guys i've been on the caffeine rant
[3896.72 - 3904.88] for a long time but i have to say
[3900.56 - 3907.28] it's the biggest food group
[3904.88 - 3909.04] caffeine is the biggest food group it's
[3907.28 - 3911.84] the food group
[3909.04 - 3913.92] 95 of the world is on for the rest of
[3911.84 - 3916.24] their lives
[3913.92 - 3918.48] if they were to do the math it's the
[3916.24 - 3920.16] number one at the top of their food
[3918.48 - 3922.24] chain it's at the top of their food
[3920.16 - 3923.12] group the number one food group their
[3922.24 - 3924.88] whole life
[3923.12 - 3926.80] and when you think about how scary that
[3924.88 - 3928.88] is oh my god
[3926.80 - 3930.64] bananas aren't at the number one food
[3928.88 - 3932.48] group there for them
[3930.64 - 3936.08] bananas is that at the number one fruit
[3932.48 - 3937.76] group no it's not
[3936.08 - 3939.60] and but the caffeine will never get the
[3937.76 - 3942.24] blame ever ever ever ever
[3939.60 - 3943.92] right mp i mean isn't that true it's the
[3942.24 - 3944.96] number one food group it's like okay
[3943.92 - 3947.28] what's your food group
[3944.96 - 3948.72] is it grains is your food group fruits
[3947.28 - 3950.64] is it vegetables
[3948.72 - 3952.16] what's your food group is it something
[3950.64 - 3954.88] else is your food group
[3952.16 - 3955.44] meat is your food group is your food
[3954.88 - 3958.00] group
[3955.44 - 3959.12] you know is it fish is it meat it's your
[3958.00 - 3961.52] proteins
[3959.12 - 3963.28] it's your grains it's your fruit your
[3961.52 - 3964.08] vegetables and what's your what's your
[3963.28 - 3967.92] tears
[3964.08 - 3969.92] all that on that and
[3967.92 - 3971.92] think about that right but guess what
[3969.92 - 3974.00] the caffeine food group is the biggest
[3971.92 - 3975.44] it's the biggest and the most important
[3974.00 - 3977.36] and it's the one that's the biggest so
[3975.44 - 3978.00] why am i talking about it so much like
