[0.12 - 3.44] a lot of people get dark spots they get
[2.04 - 7.12] black spots they get all kinds of
[3.44 - 9.88] different stuff on their face um on
[7.12 - 11.52] their body on their arms on their chest
[9.88 - 13.96] on their back and so forth a lot of
[11.52 - 16.12] people get a lot of different skin
[13.96 - 18.16] lesions people are up against a
[16.12 - 20.36] tremendous amount of skin toxins that
[18.16 - 22.80] are surfacing like I said if you guys
[20.36 - 24.44] just got on here this is the product I
[22.80 - 26.16] endorse right here this is the company I
[24.44 - 29.24] endorsed because of the quality and like
[26.16 - 30.96] I said if you were here a little earlier
[29.24 - 33.48] it's really incredible
[30.96 - 35.16] um about how it works with this product
[33.48 - 36.92] and I was just showing you the one thing
[35.16 - 38.56] right there that helps the skin alone is
[36.92 - 42.52] the fact that there's no anti-caking
[38.56 - 45.24] agents in this this product right here
[42.52 - 49.16] which is a miracle all on its
[45.24 - 50.68] own um so anyway you guys I'm going to
[49.16 - 52.48] talk a little bit I have I have a tech
[50.68 - 53.76] issue going on really but right now but
[52.48 - 56.04] I'm just going to wait and see if it
[53.76 - 57.96] kind of Remedies and then I'm going to
[56.04 - 61.20] focus on
[57.96 - 63.56] uh some other stuff too
[61.20 - 66.44] what you see is some oranges right
[63.56 - 67.80] here okay these oranges are going to be
[66.44 - 71.88] part of the Skin
[67.80 - 75.12] Potion all right so back to that whole
[71.88 - 76.48] micro needling or however it would is
[75.12 - 78.32] that that what it's called you guys
[76.48 - 80.24] micro needling it's the thing with the
[78.32 - 83.44] roller and all the prickly things on the
[80.24 - 85.92] roller right and you do this on your
[83.44 - 88.68] skin and you do your face like this when
[85.92 - 91.68] that started getting popular I was
[88.68 - 95.96] like ah
[91.68 - 98.48] a nightmare
[95.96 - 101.24] nightmare it's if you're not healing
[98.48 - 103.76] your skin from underneath from
[101.24 - 105.56] internally you'll just add to more
[103.76 - 108.36] problems doing things like that add to
[105.56 - 111.32] more Scar Tissue more issues around your
[108.36 - 113.64] skin but that's how it works Trends can
[111.32 - 116.56] be really bad just like the collagen
[113.64 - 118.44] Trend it's really bad it's a waste of
[116.56 - 121.36] money in the whole bit so when it comes
[118.44 - 123.72] down to skin like I said before if
[121.36 - 126.36] you're toxic inside and unfortunately
[123.72 - 128.32] yes pretty much everybody's toxic
[126.36 - 130.40] internally the toxins are going to get
[128.32 - 131.60] pushed to the skin the skin is going to
[130.40 - 134.60] get
[131.60 - 136.44] problematic and no lymphatic drainage is
[134.60 - 139.08] going to fix that you're just going to
[136.44 - 140.80] be chasing your tail looking for ways of
[139.08 - 142.72] fixing that and so forth so I want to
[140.80 - 144.60] make the Skin Potion now let me go get
[142.72 - 145.64] working on it now too so I got a glass
[144.60 - 148.80] right
[145.64 - 150.64] here little bit of a mug okay and this
[148.80 - 153.84] is really simple
[150.64 - 153.84] I'm just taking a
[154.36 - 161.48] scoop
[156.44 - 164.04] of this right here it's taking a scoop
[161.48 - 164.04] putting that
[164.24 - 171.16] scoop right in here just like that all
[168.88 - 173.88] right taking two
[171.16 - 176.40] capsules of the MSM that's part of the
[173.88 - 179.92] Skin Potion okay so make sure you get
[176.40 - 181.92] the MSM make sure you do that that's
[179.92 - 186.00] important
[181.92 - 188.64] okay you can get this as well and just
[186.00 - 192.28] get that but the Skin Potion you really
[188.64 - 194.20] want both you just do now it's important
[192.28 - 197.24] to have this for so many other
[194.20 - 198.64] reasons right here so many other ways
[197.24 - 203.88] it's important to have
[198.64 - 206.60] it but the MSM you want okay so you want
[203.88 - 208.44] with the skin aspect of it so I'm going
[206.60 - 212.84] to open up two
[208.44 - 212.84] capsules of the MSM powder right
[215.08 - 221.32] here so we had a tech problem I think we
[218.60 - 225.08] probably lost
[221.32 - 227.04] YouTube so right now but
[225.08 - 229.00] [Music]
[227.04 - 231.04] hey could have
[229.00 - 236.04] been
[231.04 - 238.56] anything all right so then I'm going
[236.04 - 242.28] to doing kind of like moving things
[238.56 - 242.28] around right here are you
[242.32 - 250.40] guys I got the MSM two capsules in there
[246.24 - 251.60] I got a scoop of the micro C powder the
[250.40 - 254.40] immune
[251.60 - 258.68] power now I'm going to put some orange
[254.40 - 258.68] in here I'm going to cut a fresh
[258.72 - 263.60] orange now if you really want you can
[261.36 - 265.88] put a little honey in here you don't
[263.60 - 267.72] have to with this so I'm putting orange
[265.88 - 269.08] in here now some orange might
[267.72 - 271.16] accidentally go in there when you're
[269.08 - 273.08] squeezing it and that's fine I'm seeing
[271.16 - 275.36] some pieces of orange go in there I
[273.08 - 275.36] don't
[276.80 - 281.20] mind there we go I squeezed it
[281.40 - 285.52] orange all
[283.12 - 287.08] right you can add honey in here if you
[285.52 - 290.48] want I have some
[287.08 - 292.44] honey but it doesn't have to be in this
[290.48 - 296.52] one and then we're going to get some
[292.44 - 296.52] warm water so just bear with me really
[296.64 - 303.20] quick aw's here we're going to add some
[300.28 - 304.96] warm water in here here we go we're
[303.20 - 308.12] going to stir
[304.96 - 308.12] [Music]
[308.32 - 315.92] this easy to make a medical medium Skin
[312.32 - 318.84] Potion easy to make that's a big
[315.92 - 320.28] deal it's the easiness to it that's
[318.84 - 322.96] really really helpful as well it's
[320.28 - 325.28] something you can do every single day so
[322.96 - 328.52] you can be somebody that's doing
[325.28 - 331.00] facials you know facial ma masks on your
[328.52 - 332.84] face uh
[331.00 - 334.12] right exfoliations and think about all
[332.84 - 335.84] the time you're putting in there how
[334.12 - 338.12] many people do you know spend a lot of
[335.84 - 342.04] time on their skin on their face
[338.12 - 344.32] alone this took what I don't know if I
[342.04 - 347.36] do if I recreate it how how long does it
[344.32 - 349.88] take so let me recreate it really quick
[347.36 - 352.08] okay I'm going to have that there okay
[349.88 - 352.08] you
[358.16 - 363.16] ready okay so if you're somebody going
[360.40 - 366.08] to get an appointment for a facial or
[363.16 - 369.88] you're trying to prepare yourself for an
[366.08 - 369.88] exfoliation how long does that
[371.60 - 377.60] take two hours you have to get in the
[374.92 - 380.44] car you going to do at home did you
[377.60 - 383.16] start your exfoliation
[380.44 - 386.68] yet all
[383.16 - 386.68] right okay there we
[387.00 - 391.20] go all right
[391.28 - 395.56] okay just made another if you were here
[393.92 - 397.24] right now in my kitchen I would make
[395.56 - 401.76] that one for
[397.24 - 401.76] you okay there you
[401.80 - 406.44] go now that's how easy it can be but you
[405.40 - 410.24] get
[406.44 - 413.76] results you get results and that's what
[410.24 - 415.96] matters it's not a game that's problem
[413.76 - 417.84] in the health World it all became a game
[415.96 - 419.76] I really believe that at this point I
[417.84 - 421.28] know there's some good intentions out
[419.76 - 423.64] there and people with good intentions
[421.28 - 426.40] but honestly the stuff they use or the
[423.64 - 429.00] stuff they sell or promote every day is
[426.40 - 431.00] not the best stuff it just isn't and
[429.00 - 435.68] it's not going to help the
[431.00 - 437.12] person but this is so simple and so easy
[435.68 - 438.52] you can't go wrong with that when you
[437.12 - 441.52] want to restore your
[438.52 - 441.52] skin
[442.20 - 449.56] now I'm going to sip this I got two of
[444.92 - 449.56] them here let sip this original one
[450.80 - 454.04] it's so good knowing I'm doing this for
[452.44 - 456.76] myself you
[454.04 - 460.08] know with me with my work schedule and
[456.76 - 463.96] everything like that I got a lot going
[460.08 - 465.56] on it's hard to keep up with everything
[463.96 - 468.76] and so if I can do something that's
[465.56 - 471.80] really simple and easy but yet help move
[468.76 - 473.28] like me so far so with the immune system
[471.80 - 475.32] and everything so I want to talk about
[473.28 - 479.60] why this is so good too so I'm going to
[475.32 - 483.72] give you that so the viy micro C has
[479.60 - 485.60] grape seed extract in it grape seed
[483.72 - 488.28] extract whole another form of
[485.60 - 492.28] antioxidant right there grape seed
[488.28 - 496.00] extract power of that alone in here so
[492.28 - 499.32] that's in here along with the vitamin C
[496.00 - 500.92] that's buffered that's not ascorbic acid
[499.32 - 503.16] now here's the thing if you're going to
[500.92 - 504.56] take a vitamin C every single day
[503.16 - 506.80] thinking that it's going to do the same
[504.56 - 510.44] thing it's not because a it's going to
[506.80 - 512.72] be ascorbic acid that's number one on
[510.44 - 515.56] you don't want vitamin C that's made
[512.72 - 518.68] from ascorbic acid that becomes ascorbic
[515.56 - 521.08] acid it's too harsh on your gastric
[518.68 - 523.08] glands too harsh on your stomach lining
[521.08 - 526.48] too harsh on your dadum too harsh on
[523.08 - 528.76] your intestinal tract way too
[526.48 - 530.88] harsh and when it so when it comes down
[528.76 - 533.52] to vitamin C you want something that's
[530.88 - 535.52] so buffered where it doesn't cause a
[533.52 - 537.04] problem where you can use a lot of it
[535.52 - 539.12] you can take it every single day for
[537.04 - 540.68] your immune system you can take it to
[539.12 - 541.92] help restore your immune system and your
[540.68 - 545.64] liver and throughout your body and
[541.92 - 549.12] everything that's the kind of vitamin C
[545.64 - 551.76] you want it's a kind that's not ascorbic
[549.12 - 553.68] acid I have to say this because people
[551.76 - 555.96] just don't know and they're not going to
[553.68 - 559.00] know like I said I'm not going to be on
[555.96 - 560.92] here talking about skin uh every every
[559.00 - 562.68] other day or something like that like
[560.92 - 563.96] say an influencer would do or something
[562.68 - 565.76] when they're trying to sell a product I
[563.96 - 567.84] may never talk about this until a year
[565.76 - 569.16] from now I don't know I wish I can talk
[567.84 - 571.08] about it every day but I don't have the
[569.16 - 573.72] time but you need to know what you can
[571.08 - 575.40] do to move your skin forward help heal

[575.40 - 580.08] skin it's important to have that it is

[581.72 - 586.52] all kinds and maybe you were told being
[584.56 - 588.36] in the sun too much maybe you told

[588.36 - 592.08] you were told you got some kind of issue
[590.72 - 594.28] there's people out there that are like I
[592.08 - 597.28] got Celiac and it gives me skin problems

[601.64 - 609.08] combined right along with a squeeze of
[605.56 - 610.64] orange ask your doctor if you can do it
[609.08 - 612.52] take that to your doctor the information
