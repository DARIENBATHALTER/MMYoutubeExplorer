[730.92 - 735.52] average American that is health
[732.88 - 738.44] conscious this isn't the average
[735.52 - 740.00] American that's not health conscious the
[738.44 - 742.64] average American that's not healthc
[740.00 - 746.80] conscious consumes 400
[742.64 - 751.20] lbs of over close to 400 lb of table
[746.80 - 752.48] sugar a year 4 100 lb okay people that
[751.20 - 754.56] are health conscious people that are
[752.48 - 756.52] like eating salads and having chicken
[754.56 - 758.04] and and you know being cautious and
[756.52 - 759.28] they're having that one muffin when they
[758.04 - 761.48] do or they're at a friend house and they
[759.28 - 765.04] have that one canoli whatever is they're
[761.48 - 766.20] eating 100 lb of straight sugar a year
[765.04 - 768.00] and they're having that one slice of
[766.20 - 769.96] pizza where the tomato sauce has cane
[768.00 - 771.20] sugar all laced in there and they don't
[769.96 - 772.76] even know it and they're having this one
[771.20 - 775.36] slice of just just what seems to be like
[772.76 - 778.12] a healthy slice of pizza whatever it is
[775.36 - 780.76] it's 100 lb a year okay of straight
[778.12 - 783.88] sugar just just just know that all right
[780.76 - 789.04] now check this out right now in this
[783.88 - 792.40] time okay Americans eat an average of 80
[789.04 - 795.32] lounds of fruit a year 80 lounds of
[792.40 - 799.08] fruit a year okay that's that's that's
[795.32 - 801.96] average Americans now that's
[799.08 - 803.92] not this is what's crazy those average
[801.96 - 807.24] Americans that are eating 80 lbs of
[803.92 - 808.60] fruit a year I'm not talking about
[807.24 - 812.68] people in the Alternative Health you
[808.60 - 816.36] know like movement they're eating 20 lb
[812.68 - 820.64] 10 lb of fruit a year 5 lb of fruit a
[816.36 - 822.24] year two pounds of fruit a year the
[820.64 - 824.04] people that are actually now all hooked
[822.24 - 826.44] into the alternative Vibe right now and
[824.04 - 829.32] they're hearing no fruit no fruit no
[826.44 - 831.68] fruit no carbohydrate bad for you bad
[829.32 - 834.68] for you just protein protein only
[831.68 - 837.84] protein and a few vegetables that crowd
[834.68 - 839.28] is eating 2 lbs of fruit a year to 10 at
[837.84 - 841.84] best I mean that's said best that's
[839.28 - 844.40] being generous but the average
[841.84 - 845.84] American is eating 80 lb of fruit a year
[844.40 - 849.48] let me tell you what 80 lbs of fruit a
[845.84 - 854.88] year is it's a case of apples it's a
[849.48 - 858.36] case of apples okay in a whole year a
[854.88 - 861.20] case of apples it's 50
[858.36 - 863.32] apples it's 50 apples I'm going to say
[861.20 - 866.32] it again I can't help it it's like I
[863.32 - 868.16] can't open right okay listen hang in
[866.32 - 870.32] there listen let's let's get the seat
[868.16 - 872.28] bels on cuz this is going to be this is
[870.32 - 877.64] going to be a ride this is going to be a
[872.28 - 880.88] real ride listen um 50 apples okay how
[877.64 - 884.64] many days of the year is there what this
[880.88 - 888.08] 365 or something right 365 days a year
[884.64 - 890.28] okay all right 50 apples and that's the
[888.08 - 894.68] most it gets in the average
[890.28 - 897.24] American so 80 lbs of fruit at best a
[894.68 - 899.04] year think about that right now and
[897.24 - 902.56] guess how much sugar that is is
[899.04 - 907.00] virtually nothing because apples are
[902.56 - 909.44] water pulp fiber pectin minerals
[907.00 - 911.76] vitamins
[909.44 - 914.24] nutrients and course of course I said
[911.76 - 916.52] fiber I'll say it again fiber again
[914.24 - 919.68] because different forms of fiber in the
[916.52 - 923.08] apple and when it's all said and done
[919.68 - 925.64] including the seeds and the core in the
[923.08 - 927.76] center and the seeds when it's all said
[925.64 - 930.72] and done there's very little sugar in an
[927.76 - 934.00] apple very very little sugar and an
[930.72 - 935.36] apple that we have to understand see
[934.00 - 937.48] what's happening is we're on a trend
[935.36 - 940.20] right now to take down fruit I'm telling
[937.48 - 943.24] you right now I'm serious about this
[940.20 - 946.36] there's a trend to destroy fruit okay
[943.24 - 949.44] and to take it down it's literally
[946.36 - 951.36] novelty as it's sitting in the store now
[949.44 - 954.36] not a lot of people are buying it they
[951.36 - 956.48] throw it out by the hordes in all the
[954.36 - 960.32] health food stores and conventional
[956.48 - 963.52] stores it's thrown out by the hordes I'm
[960.32 - 965.36] going to tell you guys right now okay so
[963.52 - 967.44] we have to start eating it so they're
[965.36 - 969.28] not throwing it out that's a whole
[967.44 - 971.24] another game that's that's swept in the
[969.28 - 973.48] carpet that's a dirty secret I'm telling
[971.24 - 975.80] you a dirty secret right now that the
[973.48 - 978.04] stuff is just thrown out in hordes
[975.80 - 981.96] because no one's buying it
[978.04 - 983.84] anymore being straight up okay so let's
[981.96 - 985.56] talk about that a little bit let's talk
[983.84 - 987.64] about what's going on with it first of
[985.56 - 990.00] all University professors are teaching
[987.64 - 992.76] students not to eat fruit anymore
[990.00 - 995.16] University professors are teaching
[992.76 - 996.60] students not to eat fruit anymore I'm
[995.16 - 999.24] not talking about every University
[996.60 - 1001.20] Professor okay I got I got a family
[999.24 - 1003.76] friend who's a university professor and
[1001.20 - 1006.36] and he said to me I'm not teaching that
[1003.76 - 1007.68] which is going I said yeah I know but
[1006.36 - 1010.60] have you heard of it he goes yeah I have
[1007.68 - 1012.96] kind of heard of that I had I have but
[1010.60 - 1015.20] I'm not doing it Anthony but I have
[1012.96 - 1017.48] heard of it yes but that's not where I
[1015.20 - 1020.48] got the information I'm getting that
[1017.48 - 1022.36] information from students I'm getting
[1020.48 - 1025.84] that information from students just so
[1022.36 - 1027.84] you know that that University professors
[1025.84 - 1030.36] are teaching students not to eat fruit
[1027.84 - 1033.92] anymore I just want you to know that
[1030.36 - 1035.72] right now and and then and and I know i'
[1033.92 - 1038.12] I've told you this before recently I
[1035.72 - 1040.88] told you this before but in in one one
[1038.12 - 1043.12] of the biggest alternative um um
[1040.88 - 1045.12] conferences medicine alternative uh
[1043.12 - 1047.72] medicine conferences they start off
[1045.12 - 1049.44] throwing a banana against the wall
[1047.72 - 1051.72] they've done that I don't know if they
[1049.44 - 1052.88] do at every conference I I have to be
[1051.72 - 1054.76] honest about that too I don't know if
[1052.88 - 1058.76] it's everyone but I know it was a bunch
[1054.76 - 1060.48] of them and and that was a big thing
[1058.76 - 1062.52] going on and that was happening on and
[1060.48 - 1064.84] off in just the last six seven years
[1062.52 - 1068.44] that was part of where this whole thing
[1064.84 - 1070.36] start at the downslide on the fruit so
[1068.44 - 1072.80] is this information important at all I
[1070.36 - 1075.40] mean yeah it's really important there
[1072.80 - 1077.92] big reasons for this because without
[1075.40 - 1080.16] fruit we're going to be in big trouble
[1077.92 - 1082.56] really big trouble without fruit we're
[1080.16 - 1084.60] going to go back into the the vitamin C
[1082.56 - 1087.72] deficiencies the Deep vitamin C
[1084.60 - 1089.44] deficiencies the Deep ones the Deep ones
[1087.72 - 1091.52] that cause all that kind of stuff that
[1089.44 - 1094.20] used to happen when we l we we had a
[1091.52 - 1098.92] lifespan that was like age
[1094.20 - 1102.28] 40 um lifespan of age 45 cuz we died of
[1098.92 - 1106.20] scurvy and and and squalor and and and
[1102.28 - 1108.72] and rickets and infections and you know
[1106.20 - 1109.64] disease and leprosy because there 's no
[1108.72 - 1112.88] vitamin
[1109.64 - 1114.72] C and so you know and it gets us in
[1112.88 - 1115.92] trouble cuz vitamin C runs everything it
[1114.72 - 1118.96] runs your
[1115.92 - 1122.80] adrenals it cleanses the body it
[1118.96 - 1123.84] detoxifies you it it detoxifies you
[1122.80 - 1125.36] there's people out there that can't
[1123.84 - 1127.44] detox because they have no vitamin C
[1125.36 - 1130.16] Reserves at all there's no Reserve
[1127.44 - 1131.84] there's no vitamin C Reserve you guys
[1130.16 - 1134.08] where does vitamin C come from it comes
[1131.84 - 1136.08] from fruit whether anybody likes it or
[1134.08 - 1140.32] not out there I don't care I don't care
[1136.08 - 1141.92] who it is who they they are if they
[1140.32 - 1144.92] don't understand that those deep
[1141.92 - 1147.28] reserves of vitamin C are critical For
[1144.92 - 1149.28] Your vitality for your thriving for you
[1147.28 - 1150.72] being able to handle the quickening
[1149.28 - 1153.32] coming up which means things are
[1150.72 - 1155.60] happening faster faster and faster
[1153.32 - 1158.96] people are getting sicker faster than
[1155.60 - 1161.04] ever before in history so all of this
[1158.96 - 1163.76] going on it's the vitamin C reserves
[1161.04 - 1167.08] that stops cancers prevents cancers
[1163.76 - 1170.76] halts cancers you know protects us on
[1167.08 - 1173.32] all kinds of levels with chronic illness
[1170.76 - 1175.20] it's the Deep levels of vitamin C and
[1173.32 - 1178.08] there's one other thing and that's this
[1175.20 - 1181.16] is related to vitamin C and it's
[1178.08 - 1185.32] antioxidants antioxidants stop you from
[1181.16 - 1187.68] dying we oxidize that's what aging is
[1185.32 - 1189.92] oxidizing you know I hear even in
[1187.68 - 1191.84] longevity in the longevity world out
[1189.92 - 1195.24] there they're like anti fruit in the
[1191.84 - 1197.04] longevity world they're anti fruit in
[1195.24 - 1199.00] the longevity World seriously you guys
[1197.04 - 1200.92] got to know this not not the entire
[1199.00 - 1203.52] longevity world that's out there you
[1200.92 - 1205.44] know in The Healing Arts not the not the
[1203.52 - 1206.96] entire group of them I know a longevity
[1205.44 - 1209.48] guy that's like no I'm totally into
[1206.96 - 1211.08] Fruit I'm believe me I get it I get it
[1209.48 - 1215.16] Anthony I get the antioxidants you don't
[1211.08 - 1217.88] have to tell me I got it and so not
[1215.16 - 1220.72] everybody in longevity but but the
[1217.88 - 1225.16] majority and the stars of longevity are
[1220.72 - 1227.20] anti fruit that means anti- longevity
[1225.16 - 1228.48] did you know that that means
[1227.20 - 1230.60] anti-longevity
[1228.48 - 1233.60] I'm serious about that I'm not fooling
[1230.60 - 1235.72] around I mean that because guess what
[1233.60 - 1237.52] guess where the antioxidants come from
[1235.72 - 1239.68] the antioxidants come from fruit and
[1237.52 - 1242.96] we're only eating a little bit of it now
[1239.68 - 1245.20] we're being told to stop it yeah I'm
[1242.96 - 1247.68] pretty passionate about this one there's
[1245.20 - 1248.88] a reason this is going to hurt us this
[1247.68 - 1251.80] is going to hurt us this is going to
[1248.88 - 1253.72] knock the fertility rates right down INF
[1251.80 - 1255.24] fertility is going to be just just you
[1253.72 - 1257.16] know thriving
[1255.24 - 1259.44] infertility and this is going to hurt us
[1257.16 - 1261.36] in all kinds of different levels you
[1259.44 - 1263.00] know our children's brains are not going
[1261.36 - 1265.36] to be able to develop the way they need
[1263.00 - 1266.80] to because they need certain pieces
[1265.36 - 1267.92] certain you know pieces of the puzzle
[1266.80 - 1270.92] that are in fruits we're going to talk
[1267.92 - 1274.08] about all these things that are going to
[1270.92 - 1276.32] go wrong because of this and like I said
[1274.08 - 1279.04] the longevity fronts anti fruit they
[1276.32 - 1281.36] really are because someone someone
[1279.04 - 1283.16] messed up and no one wants to admit a
[1281.36 - 1284.76] mess up because you know why we got all
[1283.16 - 1287.80] kinds of what is it the ego thing or
[1284.76 - 1289.40] whatever that is that's out there you
[1287.80 - 1290.60] know someone said to me the other day
[1289.40 - 1292.48] they said well sounds like you got an
[1290.60 - 1294.28] ego I go I don't know if I do or don't
[1292.48 - 1295.76] all I know is I care about people in
[1294.28 - 1297.36] their health and their life and I care
[1295.76 - 1299.36] about their well-being and I care if
[1297.36 - 1301.08] they're really sick or not cuz I get it
[1299.36 - 1303.76] I've seen it I know what it's like to
[1301.08 - 1306.56] suffer I've watched it I feel it and I
[1303.76 - 1308.52] get it so you can call it what it is but
[1306.56 - 1309.88] I'm going to call it what you think it
[1308.52 - 1312.88] is but I'm going to tell you what I
[1309.88 - 1315.28] think it is and I care and that's that's
[1312.88 - 1317.48] what I can't what I really you know I
[1315.28 - 1318.84] really feel what someone has gone
[1317.48 - 1320.52] through and seen what they've gone
[1318.84 - 1323.48] through and I know you guys have too
[1320.52 - 1325.52] someone was telling me that when you
[1323.48 - 1328.36] know when they're around people that are
[1325.52 - 1331.24] suffering they they can they can really
[1328.36 - 1333.36] feel it in a way that it gets it brings
[1331.24 - 1335.24] them to tears when they're around people
[1333.36 - 1337.24] that are suffering with symptoms or
[1335.24 - 1340.52] around a loved one that has symptoms and
[1337.24 - 1343.16] they're struggling and it brings them to
[1340.52 - 1345.84] tears they feel it you know they feel
[1343.16 - 1348.60] that that feeling inside I know what
[1345.84 - 1350.56] that is I I understand understand it and
[1348.60 - 1352.96] it's about it's about look reclaiming
[1350.56 - 1355.72] our health moving forward rising out of
[1352.96 - 1357.68] the ashes and and getting healthier and
[1355.72 - 1359.32] that's that's what I stand behind and
[1357.68 - 1361.16] the thing is like the longevity thing as
[1359.32 - 1363.04] I was talking about so it means
[1361.16 - 1364.68] basically the longevity stars of today
[1363.04 - 1366.48] are saying don't eat fruit they're
[1364.68 - 1368.88] saying we don't believe in longevity but
[1366.48 - 1370.80] we're going to use the word and the term
[1368.88 - 1372.76] yeah I know it's harsh I'm saying this
[1370.80 - 1374.48] but I don't care I don't care it's
[1372.76 - 1376.92] either what hold it back and not tell
[1374.48 - 1379.08] you guys what's going on out there so
[1376.92 - 1380.44] just what I'm worried some longevity
[1379.08 - 1382.56] starts going to come out and start you
[1380.44 - 1386.12] know saying stuff I mean the bottom line
[1382.56 - 1387.60] is it's about you it's not about them
[1386.12 - 1389.44] it's not about you know it's not about
[1387.60 - 1392.76] what's going it's about you and here's
[1389.44 - 1395.52] the deal we oxidize every day that's how
[1392.76 - 1399.24] the aging process works we're
[1395.52 - 1401.96] oxidizing bottom line oxidizing means
[1399.24 - 1405.76] we're dying okay and you can turn that
[1401.96 - 1408.52] around you can turn that around with
[1405.76 - 1411.24] antioxidants that's the one word
[1408.52 - 1414.04] that became pop became pop culture in
[1411.24 - 1417.44] alternative medicine that is real it
[1414.04 - 1419.04] really is real so I
[1417.44 - 1421.60] congratulate
[1419.04 - 1424.12] congratulate the scientists that was
[1421.60 - 1425.76] like oh wait a minute there's wait a
[1424.12 - 1428.64] minute there's something in here that's
[1425.76 - 1430.52] stopping oxidation inside this lemon
[1428.64 - 1433.16] wait a minute um I could see it in the
[1430.52 - 1435.84] lab in in the lab report there's an
[1433.16 - 1440.56] antioxidant here you know I I
[1435.84 - 1442.52] congratulate that guy okay that did that
[1440.56 - 1444.88] because it's that important that
[1442.52 - 1446.76] critical so what do antioxidants do they
[1444.88 - 1449.44] stop your brain from
[1446.76 - 1451.92] rotting that's what they do and they're
[1449.44 - 1453.04] in fruits they're in all the fruits

[1453.04 - 1457.00] too just just hang in there for this
[1454.60 - 1458.84] ride but the antioxidants stop your
[1457.00 - 1459.80] brain from dying it stops your brain

[1478.48 - 1483.96] time antioxidant stop us from losing our
[1481.00 - 1485.36] hips it stops us from getting to have to
[1483.96 - 1487.56] get our knees
[1485.36 - 1489.92] replaced you know and I understand that
[1487.56 - 1491.80] I support that if someone's hip is going
[1489.92 - 1494.48] and we have to replace it and and it's
[1491.80 - 1496.76] gone too far I'm I'm I stand behind
[1494.48 - 1499.00] technology today and surgical procedures
[1496.76 - 1501.64] and surgeons and the work we've done in
[1499.00 - 1504.52] medicine I stand behind that
[1501.64 - 1507.92] 100% I know surgeons that are doing
[1504.52 - 1510.36] great and mean everybody's working hard
[1507.92 - 1512.28] but the antioxidants stop more of that
[1510.36 - 1516.44] from happening stop more of the
[1512.28 - 1518.48] breakdown of the body on all levels and
[1516.44 - 1520.64] where does that come from where does it
[1518.48 - 1522.84] come from it comes from fruit you guys
[1520.64 - 1524.68] comes from fruit you believe it I keep
[1522.84 - 1527.04] on saying that bad word again over and
[1524.68 - 1530.08] over again I hope I'm not going to get
[1527.04 - 1532.80] in trouble all right so here's something
[1530.08 - 1534.92] that's really funny right now okay in
[1532.80 - 1536.28] the uh the Forefront of alternative
[1534.92 - 1541.32] medicine one of the things they're
[1536.28 - 1544.20] saying now is that fruit causes a fatty
[1541.32 - 1548.28] liver fruit causes liver problems or a
[1544.20 - 1550.16] fatty liver I can't even begin I I don't

[1561.48 - 1565.96] fruit all right you know I'm being
[1563.40 - 1568.08] sarcastic of course but no fruit doesn't
[1565.96 - 1571.08] cause a fatty liver it stops a fatty
[1568.08 - 1573.64] liver it reverses a fatty liver it re it

[1591.92 - 1595.08] everything else it's all for the liver
[1593.28 - 1598.32] fruit cleanses the liver more than
[1595.08 - 1599.12] anything else does on the planet Earth
[1598.32 - 1603.20] right
[1599.12 - 1605.76] now and it's being shunned do you see
[1603.20 - 1608.36] like what's happening here all right
[1605.76 - 1609.84] maybe it's just me maybe hey maybe it's
[1608.36 - 1611.36] I'm in the Twilight Zone and it's just
[1609.84 - 1613.12] me and I'm caught in the Twilight Zone
[1611.36 - 1615.84] right now and everybody's right and

[1620.48 - 1625.72] I'm going tell you one more thing right
[1622.08 - 1627.68] now everybody's into the brain right you
[1625.72 - 1629.68] guys are into the brain you know there's
[1627.68 - 1632.60] brain books abound and there's brain
[1629.68 - 1635.20] health this and brain health that right
[1632.60 - 1639.00] totally I'm going to tell you right now
[1635.20 - 1642.76] without fruit the brain shrinks it
[1639.00 - 1645.40] shrinks because the brain is not made up
[1642.76 - 1647.68] of fat it's a very micro small
[1645.40 - 1650.72] percentage of Omega oils that are in the
[1647.68 - 1655.76] brain the majority of the brain is made
[1650.72 - 1657.96] of glycogen storage that's a thick gluey
[1655.76 - 1659.80] carbohydrate and that's what conducts
[1657.96 - 1661.56] electricity it's a carbohydrate in the
[1659.80 - 1665.72] brain the brain is made out of
[1661.56 - 1668.12] carbohydrates glycogen and fruit keeps
[1665.72 - 1669.88] that glycogen stored in the brain so
[1668.12 - 1672.48] your brain does not
[1669.88 - 1675.80] shrink you take away fruit out of your
[1672.48 - 1678.48] life completely your brain slowly
[1675.80 - 1681.28] shrinks nobody knows that that out there
[1678.48 - 1684.32] yet okay you know and you're now an
[1681.28 - 1686.44] expert okay you know more than the best
[1684.32 - 1689.24] brain book out there right now in
[1686.44 - 1693.64] alternative medicine you know more I
[1689.24 - 1696.00] mean that's amazing okay that's amazing
[1693.64 - 1698.32] you guys are incredible because you know
[1696.00 - 1700.24] that now and you can that's the football
[1698.32 - 1701.64] right there you know that's that's right
[1700.24 - 1703.12] there you can pass that football along
[1701.64 - 1705.08] to someone else and change somebody's
[1703.12 - 1707.64] life and stop their brain from shrinking
[1705.08 - 1709.16] and then you know what you think how it
[1707.64 - 1711.16] change somebody's life I'll tell you why
[1709.16 - 1712.72] cuz if you get somebody eating fruit and
[1711.16 - 1714.96] they get into the habit and they bring
[1712.72 - 1717.96] it in every day and it's in there every
[1714.96 - 1720.08] day and twice a day three times a day
[1717.96 - 1722.40] they're eating some fruit here's what
[1720.08 - 1724.36] happens you stop Alzheimer's in their
[1722.40 - 1725.84] life when they probably would have
[1724.36 - 1728.28] gotten it there's a chance that that
[1725.84 - 1730.28] person may have been an Alzheimer's
[1728.28 - 1733.04] victim and that could have been their
[1730.28 - 1736.24] demise way way down the road and you
[1733.04 - 1738.60] just stopped it 30 years before it could
[1736.24 - 1740.56] happen cuz you gave them a habit that
[1738.60 - 1742.44] brought fruit into their life like the
[1740.56 - 1744.24] wild blueberries like you know those
[1742.44 - 1746.72] wild blueberries they are the ultimate
[1744.24 - 1749.32] brain food of all time in history right
[1746.72 - 1751.60] now on planet Earth is the wild
[1749.32 - 1754.48] blueberry and it reverses not only
[1751.60 - 1756.88] reverses brain diseases but it stops you
[1754.48 - 1759.24] from losing you know your brain and
[1756.88 - 1762.12] having it get corrosive and having heavy
[1759.24 - 1764.84] metals wreak havoc and
[1762.12 - 1768.00] oxidize oxidize the brain and cause of
[1764.84 - 1770.36] memory loss and Alzheimer's and dementia
[1768.00 - 1773.72] and and Parkinson's and everything else
[1770.36 - 1776.40] that we that goes wrong in our brain and
[1773.72 - 1779.24] wild blueberries stop that so when you
[1776.40 - 1781.36] get somebody on fruit you get them on a
[1779.24 - 1782.48] habit of it like yourself like yourself
[1781.36 - 1783.80] and then you bump into somebody you're
[1782.48 - 1786.44] like hey you really need to be doing
[1783.80 - 1787.72] this fruit you don't know it but you
[1786.44 - 1791.04] might have stopped them from getting
[1787.72 - 1792.88] dementia 20 years down the road what
[1791.04 - 1796.64] what a great thing is tell me that's not
[1792.88 - 1798.84] a miracle it's a powerful Miracle want
[1796.64 - 1800.92] to talk to you about eating fruit out of
[1798.84 - 1802.76] season there's this big thing like you
[1800.92 - 1804.64] eat in season and I I'm I'm all about
[1802.76 - 1806.56] eating in season so if you're you know
[1804.64 - 1808.48] if you got the farmers market and you
[1806.56 - 1810.16] got the Farmers Market has some type of
[1808.48 - 1812.04] fruit that's in that season like apples
[1810.16 - 1813.80] or something it'll have that elevated
[1812.04 - 1816.16] biotic I talk about all the time like in
[1813.80 - 1818.16] my book medical medium right you guys
[1816.16 - 1820.68] know the elevated biotic that's the
[1818.16 - 1822.92] biotic no one else knows about that's
[1820.68 - 1825.08] really Advanced and ahead of everything
[1822.92 - 1827.48] else in the gut health books and I say
[1825.08 - 1829.44] this so if you just tuned in and this is
[1827.48 - 1831.36] your first show you know where to get
[1829.44 - 1833.36] the information so you can heal and help
[1831.36 - 1834.84] others because that's what it's about so
[1833.36 - 1836.24] anyway you pick that apple right at the
[1834.84 - 1838.84] farmer's
[1836.24 - 1840.64] market and it's in season it's
[1838.84 - 1842.40] incredible without a doubt but when
[1840.64 - 1843.96] fruit goes out of season I don't want
[1842.40 - 1845.40] you to stop eating fruit because it goes
[1843.96 - 1847.28] out of season cuz I'm telling you right
[1845.40 - 1848.56] now it's in season somewhere else
[1847.28 - 1850.44] somewhere else on the planet it's in
[1848.56 - 1853.20] season doesn't matter if it's shipped
[1850.44 - 1856.80] it's in season somewhere
[1853.20 - 1859.20] else okay and if you took a trip to to
[1856.80 - 1861.04] France or you tri took a trip down to
[1859.20 - 1862.60] you know Brazil or whatever it is and
[1861.04 - 1864.28] there was a fruit in season there that
[1862.60 - 1866.88] wasn't in season here are you not going
[1864.28 - 1868.28] to eat it cuz it's not in season you're
[1866.88 - 1869.48] going to eat it you're going to eat that
[1868.28 - 1870.76] melon you're going to eat that mango
[1869.48 - 1872.64] you're going to eat that papaya whatever
[1870.76 - 1874.12] it is if it's in season over there
[1872.64 - 1876.12] you're going to eat it well it's still
[1874.12 - 1878.24] in season over there regardless of where
[1876.12 - 1881.84] you are in the planet so don't fall
[1878.24 - 1883.88] don't fall victim to that myth that's
[1881.84 - 1885.60] been thrown out there where don't eat
[1883.88 - 1888.16] anything that's out of season now so
[1885.60 - 1889.64] just walk by the entire produce section
[1888.16 - 1892.16] because it's all out of season just
[1889.64 - 1893.96] don't don't don't do that okay that's
[1892.16 - 1897.88] not good either it's a whole another
[1893.96 - 1900.64] thing that's gone wrong out there so I
[1897.88 - 1903.96] mean look the bottom line the bottom
[1900.64 - 1906.72] line is we have to get more fruit into
[1903.96 - 1907.92] our bodies and I'm going to tell you why
[1906.72 - 1910.48] let's start cutting through this a
[1907.92 - 1913.52] little bit all right this is fun this is

[1916.32 - 1921.60] we're going to start with melons melons
[1919.56 - 1924.56] let me tell you right now melons are the
[1921.60 - 1928.28] mother's milk of the planet the mother's
[1924.56 - 1930.84] milk okay they take no digestion at all
[1928.28 - 1933.96] at all they're literally pre-digested
[1930.84 - 1936.72] they have so many enzymes in there that
[1933.96 - 1938.84] they don't need digestion at all on any
[1936.72 - 1941.84] level your body does not have to even
[1938.84 - 1943.76] digest it on any level your body
[1941.84 - 1946.48] instantly digest it because it's already
[1943.76 - 1949.48] digested it's pre-digested it's it's
[1946.48 - 1951.88] that power ful and you know did you ever
[1949.48 - 1954.08] hear about you know like intravenous
[1951.88 - 1956.04] vitamins you guys have you ever have you
[1954.08 - 1957.88] ever done that you did that have you
[1956.04 - 1959.92] ever done that where you had like you
[1957.88 - 1963.12] know intravenous vitamin C in
[1959.92 - 1966.56] intravenous glutathione intravenous
[1963.12 - 1968.80] Myers cocktail which is a
[1966.56 - 1971.20] multivitamin well if you've ever done
[1968.80 - 1972.56] that and you know that hey there's
[1971.20 - 1976.04] there's you know there's something to be
[1972.56 - 1980.64] said about that but let me tell you this
[1976.04 - 1984.92] melons are equal to an
[1980.64 - 1987.84] intravenous vitamin to getting IV
[1984.92 - 1991.08] vitamins melons have a highly Active
[1987.84 - 1994.00] water content binding on the poisons of
[1991.08 - 1997.00] all kinds mold MotoX ands neurotoxins
[1994.00 - 1999.24] from viruses like Epstein bar undigested
[1997.00 - 2002.00] proteins ammonia you know ammonia
[1999.24 - 2003.64] permeability the real problem behind you
[2002.00 - 2005.20] know leaky gut the real problem behind
[2003.64 - 2006.52] gut problems that nobody knows out there
[2005.20 - 2007.68] the experts don't know ammonia
[2006.52 - 2009.72] permeability
[2007.68 - 2013.52] that whole thing Spirit brought to you
[2009.72 - 2016.68] guys all of that gets absorbed by the
[2013.52 - 2019.92] the the minerals the active water in
[2016.68 - 2022.12] melon it's the ultimate detoxifier pulls
[2019.92 - 2026.08] all the poison out of the body can even
[2022.12 - 2028.72] pull radiation along with it because the
[2026.08 - 2032.84] the content the water content in melon
[2028.72 - 2034.68] is so grounded it's so grounding and so
[2032.84 - 2037.36] bioactive and so
[2034.68 - 2039.68] alive and it's filled with so many
[2037.36 - 2042.04] electrolytes that it literally grabs
[2039.68 - 2044.12] onto everything that shouldn't be in the
[2042.04 - 2045.72] body and pulls it out of the body some
[2044.12 - 2048.16] people say well I don't feel good when I
[2045.72 - 2049.52] go on melon I got you know something
[2048.16 - 2051.20] yeah I just don't feel that great when I
[2049.52 - 2053.80] go on melon that's because it's pulling
[2051.20 - 2056.64] so much garbage and so many toxins and
[2053.80 - 2058.44] so much poison out of the body and
[2056.64 - 2060.44] rushing it out of the kidneys you're not
[2058.44 - 2063.72] going to feel that great it just tell
[2060.44 - 2064.96] it's going to tell you you're that toxic
[2063.72 - 2066.68] and then when you start feeling a little
[2064.96 - 2068.48] bit better on melon you've gotten rid of
[2066.68 - 2070.68] that much poison and you're that much
[2068.48 - 2071.88] more vital and you're moving forward
[2070.68 - 2075.28] that much
[2071.88 - 2078.40] more melons have so much silica in it
[2075.28 - 2081.48] you guys silica you know silica right so
[2078.40 - 2085.28] much silica they restore joints
[2081.48 - 2086.96] ligaments teeth bones that's the kind of
[2085.28 - 2088.60] silica we're talking about and as far as
[2086.96 - 2092.00] people that worried about kidney
[2088.60 - 2094.28] problems and kidney function melons help
[2092.00 - 2096.28] restore kidneys they give the kidneys an
[2094.28 - 2098.28] ability to heal and you're talking about
[2096.28 - 2100.08] diabetes and blood sugar issues melons
[2098.28 - 2102.92] are amazing let's cut let's cut into
[2100.08 - 2106.20] some of the conditions that melons do so
[2102.92 - 2109.60] that melons offer okay Crohn's disease
[2106.20 - 2111.96] colitis peptic ulcers melons are
[2109.60 - 2114.96] incredible for these conditions okay
[2111.96 - 2116.64] mystery infertility and I say mystery

[2116.64 - 2122.12] stuff is Mystery that's the whole point
[2118.96 - 2123.80] in chronic illness it's mystery and and
[2122.12 - 2126.12] this is about answers here this is this
[2123.80 - 2127.64] is what it's about so we're all keeping
[2126.12 - 2128.80] fruit away from people and we don't even

[2670.84 - 2676.72] time oh grapes whoa grapes sugar too
[2673.76 - 2678.96] much sugar and that's what I hear about
[2676.72 - 2680.16] grapes is that there's just too much
[2678.96 - 2683.04] sugar
[2680.16 - 2686.60] involved and but that's not accurate
[2683.04 - 2690.08] actually not accurate at all grapes
[2686.60 - 2693.56] don't have a lot of sugar I'm being
[2690.08 - 2694.72] straight about this they don't grape you

[2702.28 - 2707.80] much sugar they wouldn't be tart they
[2705.24 - 2710.12] wouldn't be slightly sour you wouldn't
[2707.80 - 2715.08] detect any sour nature you wouldn't
[2710.12 - 2718.20] detect any tartness to any Grape at all
[2715.08 - 2720.84] if there was that much sugar in grape
[2718.20 - 2722.92] there really isn't I mean of course if
[2720.84 - 2724.92] you juice tons and tons and tons of
[2722.92 - 2727.00] grape and then concentrate it then juice
[2724.92 - 2729.20] it then reconcentrate and concentrate it
[2727.00 - 2731.16] again you're going to then build up the
[2729.20 - 2733.68] fructose and that's what you're going to
[2731.16 - 2736.16] do but I'm talking about eating grapes

[2995.72 - 2998.76] tree every fig tree and I'm going to
[2997.52 - 3000.44] give you a piece of information that
[2998.76 - 3004.96] does that's not out there anywhere that
[3000.44 - 3009.04] comes from Spirit every fig tree ends on
[3004.96 - 3011.12] a nine meaning all the figs that grow on
[3009.04 - 3013.76] that tree that fall off the tree that it
[3011.12 - 3014.60] has in that season equal to number nine
[3013.76 - 3017.84] in the

[3017.84 - 3021.60] it never lands on a two it never lands
[3019.72 - 3025.00] on a four it never lands on a five it
[3021.60 - 3027.80] ends on a nine and that's the power of
