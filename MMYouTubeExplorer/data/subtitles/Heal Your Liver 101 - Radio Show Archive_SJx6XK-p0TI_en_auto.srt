run into young people all the time that

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,720
have been convinced entr trenched in the

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,600
fact that science and research is so

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,320
Advanced that technology is so Advanced

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,680

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,759
everything else and they're in school

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,479

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
see like the Clones I call them clones

83
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
you know cuz I don't like calling them

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,519
trolls because trolls I think is like a

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
a nice word it's like it's doesn't

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,599

00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,760
know the whole bit it's just like it's

89
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,879
the trolls are kind of friendly to some

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,560
degree so you know I call them clones

91
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,200
they're all they all their hatred is all

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,920
the same inside and they all say the

93
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,959
same thing so I they're like cloning off

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,200
each other something so kind of

95
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,920
genetically altered modified organism or

96

183
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,680
happy and then they get the the weight G

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,639
no matter what later whether they're 35

185
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,960
or 38 and they get it or whatever

186
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,199
happens they still get it it's

187
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,240
unbelievable and so you know also on the

188
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,639
subtitle sibo and autoimmune disease

189
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,520
that's just a fraction of what's in the

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
book so when you know that that I can

191
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,360
only cover so much so this is about

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,639
healing the liver and where do we start

193
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,759
we start with one of the most important

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,199
aspects what's inside your liver what's

195
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,720
wrong with your liver to begin with we

196
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,840
come here with sick livers we're born

197
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,120
with livers that are weakened and a lot

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,400
of toxins are passed down passed down

199
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,520
from Generations okay then we get

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,280
exposed to toxins all through the course

201
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,840
of it if you think there's nothing in

202
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,120
your liver you're sadly mistaken and

203
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,800
terribly wrong very important to know

204
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,960
and then there's also the different

205
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,919
depths of the liver and that's another

206
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,080
thing too to heal your liver you got to

207
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,639
get to the core there's a subsurface

208
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,120
there's the surface the subsurface and

209
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,120
the inner core the three levels of the

210
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,639
liver and and where where toxins are

211
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,560
stored by the liver to protect your butt

212
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,680
so this is all information is critical

213
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,800
first of all the for warning everybody

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
because there's a lot of new people that

215
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,919
listen to the podcasts and radio shows

216
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
for warn you the information that always

217
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,879
comes from me in here is not out there

218
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,160
yet it's just never out there yet and

219
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,440
and and some of it has escaped from all

220
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,160
the work I've done and gotten out there

221
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,520
and and what not meaning like been out

222
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,879
there even even science has caught up

223
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,199
science of research caught up to speed

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,599
with a few things that I already

225
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,199
documented long before them and and so

226
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
so there's that information is out there

227
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,120
but today with you know with this and

228
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
much of the radio shows none of the in

229
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
it's all information you're never going

230
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
to hear read any books or find online

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,720
just for warning you so you don't jump

232
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,680
off the show and say all right let me

233
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,720
look into this yeah good luck cuz

234
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,319
exactly it's not going to be there so

235
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
there's the petrochemicals group it's

236
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
inside our liver all the time Plastics

237
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,440
okay so it's important to know and I

238
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,199
have to cover some of these

239
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
troublemakers I call it so in Liver

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,560
Rescue I call it troublemakers there's

241
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,800
gasoline we pump our own gas now we

242
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,039
inhale it you name it we didn't pump her

243
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,120
own gas only the gas station attend

244
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,240
attendance actually got poisoned that

245
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,440
was it only those poor guys okay those

246
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,080
are the ones that got poisoned that was

247
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,080
it they pumped gas all day in people's

248
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,919
cars they got it on their hands all day

249
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,919
they breathe it and inhaled it all day

250
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,120
now we pump gas now our 16-year-old

251
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,240
daughters pump gas okay and getting

252
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,600
exposure early on something that never

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,080
existed before something that never

254
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,519
existed before it's unbelievable so you

255
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,839
have to do things to care for your liver

256
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,600
that's why the show is called healing

257
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,959
your liver gasoline wouldn't believe the

258
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,839
solvents in there and the chemicals that

259
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,519
are in there unbelievable and what it

260
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,519
does and how that petrochemical gets

261
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,120
inside the liver Plastics is one of them

262
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,320
it's a whole another one they go into

263
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,839
deep parts of the liver diesel just

264
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,279

bought you can't hide from it all you

365
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,800
can try to hide from it a little bit

366
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,120
protect yourself you can protect

367
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,600
yourself a little bit but we have to

368
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,519
figure out how to heal the liver and get

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,000
this out of the liver so you don't get

370
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,079
sick so you don't get the hot flashes

371
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,440
later the heart palpitations the viral

372
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,120
diseases the viral situations all the

373
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,680
different things the Hashimoto because

374
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,440
of you know Epstein bar flourishing

375
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,360
inside the liver so you don't get sick

376
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,360
so you don't get all these problems just

377
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,120
everything under the sun can happen tons

378
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,399
of acne tons of this tons of that it's

379
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,399
all because the liver Harbors bacteria

380
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:13,160
viruses lots of poisons we can heal our

381
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,519
liver this information doesn't exist out

382
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,920
there it's beyond me that's why I had to

383
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,880
put this out there I was so sick sick

384
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,399
and

385
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,040
tired sick and tired you know I always I

386
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,680
I always have this like thing where I

387
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,000
have this hope and this Faith thing

388
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,199
because I have a lot of faith and a lot

389
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,880
of Hope and it and it seems to it seems

390
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,079
to take over and when it takes over I

391
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,079
say oh yeah no no there's going to be

392
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,720
some cool trendy doctors that are out in

393
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
the circuit that people all know they're

394
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,399
going to figure things out they're not

395
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,320
just going to be talking stupid about uh

396
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,120
you know lower carbs and here's what you

397
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,560
got to eat now and here's what you got

398
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
to do and then they'll take my celery

399
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,480
juice the whole Spirit celery juice

400
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
thing and they'll start saying it's

401
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,240
theirs or something whatever whatever

402
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,920
they do you know I sit back I say fine

403
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,560
let everybody do what they want to do

404
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
but but I'm thinking someone's going to

405
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,519
figure things out by now and they don't

406
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,360
and then I have to kick it up a notch

407
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,680
every time I sit back and I try to take

408
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,720
a break for a little bit and I try to

409
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,320
rest a little and say I have hope and I

410
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,240
have faith that all that you know the

411
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,560
the so-called experts and science and

412
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,360
research are going to actually be able

413
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,360
to figure a fraction of what I have to

414
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,519
deliver just a fraction I have faith and

415
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,240
I tell spirit let me just kick back let

416
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,959
me kick back and chill a little bit

417
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,320
because I have faith and hope and I

418
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,480
always get let down and disappointed and

419
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,959
then have to make a 200,000 word

420
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,680
manuscript called Liver Rescue and

421
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,959
literally almost put myself in the grave

422
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
doing it cuz you wouldn't believe how

423
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,519
hard it was to write this book because I

424
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,120
can't I get sick and tired of it all

425
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,560
it's unbelievable all right back to this

426
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,560
can't help it you guys

427
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,759
fluoride wait first of all smoke

428
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,880
exposure of any kind any kind of smoke

429
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:47,920
exposure it's in the liver whatever was

430
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,279
whatever was burning in that smoke like

431
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,720
plastic burning across the country

432
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,279
everywhere from California all the way

433
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,399
to Florida all the way to the East Coast

434
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,680
West Coast all the way everywhere

435
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,320
plastic burning every everywhere burning

436
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,279
burning burning agricultural

437
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,440
conventional agricultural burning

438
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,279
plastic everywhere it's in the air it's

439
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
smoke it's also plastic it's in our

440
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,839
lungs it hurts people fluoride ever get

441
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,320
a fluoride treatment no you don't have

442
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,279
to just a little bit of water in a

443
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,639
restaurant sure you get in a restaurant

444
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,680
there's fluoride in the water have you

445
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,279
had it yeah there's fluoride in in Soda

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
Pop there's fluoride in everything so

447
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
that's a whole another thing

448
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,680
chlorine swimming in pools all of that

449
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,839
chlorine gets us in just one way or

450
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,040
another it's unbelievable able you know

451
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,240
and then there's the whole thing with

452
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,800
the the problematic food chemical group

453
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,319
that sits inside the liver too at the

454
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,000
three different levels you know that I

455
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,959
talk about and I describe this in detail

456
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,120
in the book I can't cover a fraction of

457
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,360
this aspart Ane espartan right aspart

458
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,079
tene that's another thing too believe me

459
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
we all have a little bit in us one way

460
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,040
or another somehow some some way

461
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,759
artificial sweeteners y we all have it

462
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,000
in US somehow some way where is it still

463
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:56,759
sitting inside the liver has it left no

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
it hasn't left because we're on high fat

465
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,279
diets which is part of what I'm doing

466
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
with healing the liver here talking

467
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,000
about how you have to lower the fats in

468
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,160
your diet contrary to this to the silly

469
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,839
Trend out there of fats fats fats just

470
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,800
just make people sick and what happens

471
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,560
is it's really kind of deceiving and

472
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,240
Elusive where you know where you take

473
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,880
out the processed foods you take out the

474
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,120
gluten you take out stuff like that for

475
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
the first time or you take it out

476
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,199
seriously or you go raw or whatever it

477
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,680
is and just whatever it is or you just

478
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,160
you're you're paleo or something or

479
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,399
you're something that's not paleo but

480
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,600
you're look you know you're only eating

481
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
a little bit of animal protein and

482
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,759
bringing in more fruits and vegetables

483
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
now because they're finally somebody's

484
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,079
finally starting to figure out that

485
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,399
fruits and vegetables are the very thing

486
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,160
that heals everybody whatever it is if

487
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,120
you're still high fat whether it's

488
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,399
plant-based high fat or plant-based fats

489
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,680
or whatever it is and still doing some

490
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,959
animal fat whatever whatever you're

491
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
you're you're just still going to run

492
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,720
into trouble and you're not going to get

493
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,279
what I'm saying is in the liver ever out

494
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,759
and there will be a disease somehow

495
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,120
coming down the line whether you're 70

496
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,519
years old 80 years old 60 years old and

497
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,880
maybe does doesn't matter to somebody

498
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,959
who's 24 years old 23 years old because

499
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,240
you never think you're going to ever

500
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,679
turn 70 you never think you're going to

501
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,039
be 70 23y old will never believe they'll

502
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,039
never believe they'll be 70 years

503
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,799
old or they'll just think well I'm

504
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,039
supposed to live forever right it's

505
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,600
unbelievable so here's the deal all

506
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,880
right there's MSG inside our liver tons

507
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,079
of it for most people even nutritional

508
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,640
yeast the cleanest nicest funnest

509
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,959
nutritional yeast you can find has

510
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,640
glutamic acid in it naturally occurring

511
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,080
if it isn't even the crappy nutritional

512
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,360
yeast that actually has MSG literally

513
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,039
laed in it so either way it's it's

514
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,000
nutritional yeast is disastrous

515
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,960
everybody's pouring it on their food oh

516
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,120
I have people I put a recipe out on

517
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,520
social media and then you'll have

518
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,360
comments saying that recipe really looks

519
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,799
good but it would be so much better

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,080
easily so much better if you knew about

521
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,880
nutritional yeast Anthony like what how

522
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,240
about do you know about nutritional

523
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,159
yeast about it being so toxic for the

524
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,679
liver fill the glutamic acid no matter

525
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,240
what in good company or great product or

526
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,679
whatever it is

527
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,320
it's bad stuff it's inside the liver

528
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,480
glutamic acid MSG for Malahide

529
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,720
everywhere it's in it's all kinds of

530
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,440
stuff preservatives like the whole bit

531
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
so I mean where does it end I mean am I

532
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,159
boring you guys cuz I hope not I hope

533
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,559
I'm not boring you problematic Foods

534
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,840
what about those let me tell you

535
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:23,200
something about eggs eggs keep pathogens

536
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,400
that thrive inside the liver alive they

537
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,840
eat eggs it's the whole point someone

538
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,919
said to me and they still do here like

539
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,720
well no my eggs are organic they're free

540
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,200
range they're just grass-fed whatever it

541
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,200
is they'll be like you know what I mean

542
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,559
they're like no the chickens run wild

543
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,000

toxic salts that were used it's why you

can heal from celery juice cuz toxic

673
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
salts sit inside the liver stored and

674
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,600
then when you eat vinegar it pickles the

675
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,120
liver a pickle action occurs

676
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,000
inside the liver a pickling because your

677
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,760
bloodstream is also filled with sodium

678
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,559
so it's a pickling that occurs so you

679
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,279
got to be careful celery juice helps

680
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:41,640

904
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,399

905
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:46,279

herbs powerful supplements for the liver

908
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,480
I'm going to tell you something right

909
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,799
now if you hear somewhere like oh

910
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:00,000
supplements are bad for the body they're

911
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,080
bad B for your health it's herbs only

912
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,240
herbs only herbs

913
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:10,840
only not true at all not true at all

914
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,279
very interesting okay I've had people

915
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,000
with chronic illness dying in their beds

916
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,919
families getting a hold of me over the

917
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,360
years desperate while they're laying

918
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,679
there laying there in agony okay and

919
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,039
literally all it took was the right kind

920
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,440
of be 12 to get that person recovering

921
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,000
to make the first recovery the first

922
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,720
literally where they can use their arms

923
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,080
and legs crawl out of bed and start to

924
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,120
heal and start to eat again and it was

925
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,840
just B12 by itself the right kind of B12

926
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,799
by itself I've witnessed that I've seen

927
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,000
it happen I've helped people throughout

928
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,360
the years do that and b12 is a

929
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
supplement it's not an herb so when you

930
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,639
see that on Instagram and you see that

931
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,799
in social media and you see that oh it's

932
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:00,159
just all about herbs meanwhile the

933
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,039
people the herbs are talking about are

934
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,000
even in alcohol they're just garbage on

935
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,519
top of it and you see that out there you

936
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,919
say something you say something if you

937
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,159
want because you know and chances are

938
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,159

Foods celery can't say enough about it I

1054
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,960
you know what I can't even say enough

1055
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,240
about it it's not even just the

1056
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,880
Undiscovered subgroups of of of of

1057
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,359
mineral salts here's the thing about

1058
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,040
celery it's all the rage now because of

1059
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,760
us right cuz of spirit and medical

1060
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,560
medium and all that and everybody's

1061
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,560
drinking it worldwide and celery's

1062
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,200
running out Cel the celery Growers are

1063
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,319
freaking out all of that I get it you

1064
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,680
know I I I I brought that though to the

1065
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:10,839
world for a reason first of all science

1066
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,640
of research doesn't even know anything

1067
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,319
about celery that's why when a dietitian

1068
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,520
or something does this little does this

1069
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:17,079
little article or somewhere some

1070
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,280
conventional thing or alternative thing

1071
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,599
does an article and they bring somebody

1072
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,680
on and they're acting like a celery

1073
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,079
juice expert when they don't know

1074
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,560
anything about it they'll even say well

1075
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,280
there's not a lot out there in science

1076
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,839
and research about s of course there

1077
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,560
isn't of course there isn't about

1078
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,599
anything really about anything to do

1079
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,839
with anything that's health and relates

1080
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:37,200
unbelievable but here's the deal with

1081
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,480
celery it's these undiscovered subgroups

1082
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,440
sodium that's what it is they're called

1083
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,319
cluster salts I call them cluster salts

1084
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,560
I do all right I do because that's what

1085
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:49,400
they are and they then what they do is

1086
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,680
they enter into cell membranes and they

1087
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,079
inhibit growth of viruses they strip the

1088
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,680
membrane off of viruses that information

1089
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,680
will be available through through

1090
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,040
science and research 50 years from now

1091
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,240
how old will you be then but that's when

1092
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,520
it will be available so don't stop

1093
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,520
drinking celery juice just because this

1094
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,000
is the only source of information so far

1095
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,280
celery restores the liver's bio

1096
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,640
production I'm just giving you a little

1097
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,079
couple couple little things the

1098
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,000
hydrochloric acid builds back up in the

1099
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:22,599
stomach glands the seven blend that

1100
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,200
nobody knows about that I put in book

1101
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,920
one and it's also in this book two book

1102
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,480
as well the liver resue book I talk more

1103
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,560
about it celery purges the liver okay

1104
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:38,000
that's how critical It Is by bringing

1105
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:41,200
down liver heat to a safe

1106
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,400
level it helps dissolve Gull Stones it

1107
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,000
can do it's I mean I could go on and on

1108
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,160
and on we don't have the

1109
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,960
time cherries great for the liver that's

1110
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,200
right

1111
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,560
cranberries great for the liver coconut

1112
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,119
water great for the liver cruciferous

1113
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,839
vegetables great for the liver that's

1114
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,680
right cucumbers amazing cucumbers are

1115
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,400
allies they're hydration they're

1116
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,520
hydration source for the liver as well

1117
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,319
kind of like with the Apple but it has

1118
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,920
anti-inflammatory liver Pro liver

1119
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,599
properties for anti-inflammatory for the

1120
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,480
liver Danny lion greens it's another

1121
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,480
good food do you like any of these Foods

1122
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,640

know you're doing too many fats and

1130
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,359
you're bogging down the liver if you're

1131
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,560
vegan you're doing too many fats you're

1132
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,240
bogging down the liver um yeah you got

1133
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
to lower the fats I'm sorry about that

1134
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,920
but you have to if you're pale or you

1135
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,920
doing to you're worried too much about

1136
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,200
your proteins proteins protein proteins

1137
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,200
because you're suckered into the protein

1138
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,079
myth the protein law and theory that was

1139
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,000
created in 1933 to control people um

1140
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,400
same thing with you vegans too just tell

1141
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,880
your vegan friends you've been suckered

1142
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,960
into the protein myth so you guys are so

1143
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,520
anti conventional like you're anti I

1144
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,560
noticed who the vegans is what I really

1145
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,119
love and I love vegans I love them all I

1146
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,800
love everybody I love paleo people I

1147
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,040
love everybody I mean that's the whole

1148
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,200
point you got to love everybody you got

1149
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,680
to get them better and you got to get

1150
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,119
them healed you got to get them to get

1151
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,880
do the right things but I'm going to

1152
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,560
tell you something right now I've

1153
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,960
noticed about the vegans is they're so

1154
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,440
they're all of course they're against

1155
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,480
the whole animal thing they have of

1156
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,160
course they're against the animal

1157
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,640
killing thing all of that they're

1158
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,319
against all that and they're against

1159
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,240
they're against just the whole Animal

1160
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,839
product thing all that 100% totally with

1161
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,079
them I think you know I'm support them

1162
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,640
100% but but yet they take the the they

1163
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,040
take that knowledge with them on their

1164
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:35,640
side they they they take protein with

1165
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,319
them that the protein law that was

1166
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,319
created for animal proteins to sucker

1167
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:40,960
people into thinking they need protein

1168
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:43,440
because of the deal the the contracts

1169
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,240
that were made in 1933 with the with

1170
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,040
with the how the world worked I talk

1171
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,800
about in this book by the way and so

1172
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,880
it's like the vegans are are literally

1173
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,200
they want to be separate from the animal

1174
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,680
uh protein people but yet they take the

1175
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,760
animal protein like law with them them

1176
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:01,079
and then they're all focused on protein

1177
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,560
it's actually really sad and and vegans

1178
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,200
don't like to be tricked they don't want

1179
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,680
to be tricked they they want to think

1180
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,839
they're the smartest people on the

1181
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,920
planet they don't want to be tricked and

1182
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,960
meanwhile they get tricked it just

1183
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,839
doesn't really make any sense so if

1184
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,280
you're vegan plant-based just try to

1185
00:42:10,839 --> 00:42:14,280
figure that out and stop worrying about

1186
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,359
protein you know listen to my protein

1187
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,200
radio show listen to you know see see

1188
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,800
you know learn about it get the Liver

1189
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,440
Rescue book so you can learn about how

1190
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,839
you don't want to be tricked like that

1191
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,559
and the animal protein people are not

1192
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,000
supposed to be tricked like that either

1193
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,559
they if they want animal proteins you

1194
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,520
guys that's fine if that's what you want

1195
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:32,240
it's fine the point is is everybody

1196
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,280
needs to lower their fats stop thinking

1197
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,520
about protein because the protein thing

1198
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,000
just gets you in trouble so you end up

1199
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,040
eating more fat and you get yourself

1200
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,040
sick this is liver 101 right now okay

1201
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,839
this is how we then just can't get these

1202
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,880
toxins I just mentioned out of the liver

1203
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,839
we're all eating fats because we're all

1204
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,680
sucked into the protein law and it's sad

1205
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,359
that the plant-based people are still

1206
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,040
talking protein protein protein and

1207
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,559
they're still all all hung up on science

1208
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,079
and research everybody's battling

1209
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,160
everybody with science and research it's

1210
00:42:57,079 --> 00:43:01,200
all bogus and all paid for so it's

1211
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,440
unbelievable paleo people are like there

1212
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,079
there's all the science of why this

1213
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,880
works you know this is what they did you

1214
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,720
know this is how man ate 10,000 years

1215
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,319
ago nobody knows what man ate 10,000

1216
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,920
years ago but here's here's all the

1217
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:12,839
science here's how it goes here's how it

1218
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,400
goes and then you got and then you got

1219
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,880
the plant-based people like no no no

1220
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
plant food here's the science behind it

1221
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,720
and this is what you got to do it's this

1222
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,559
this this and they're battling each

1223
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,720
other it's unbelievable and there all

1224
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,079
these hybrid diets are made from them

1225
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,559
and then but yet they're all hung up on

1226
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,240
this protein law and killing themselves

1227
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,119
on high diets without even knowing it

1228
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,359
even if they got better they're still

1229
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,680
going to get worse way way way down the

1230
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,200
road unless you learn how to heal the

1231
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,559
liver and lower the fats and learn how

1232
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,119
to do things for your liver and take

1233
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,720
care of yourself because yeah when

1234
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,440
you're 25 it's all cute and fun but tell

1235
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,960
you right now when you're 45 and you're

1236
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,160
gaining weight and no one's helping you

1237
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,520
and you're fatigued and you can't get

1238
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,960
out of bed anymore cuz you didn't know

1239
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,920
you had a viral infection all these

1240
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,720
years and it wasn't handled right cuz

1241
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,040
you were eating a high fat diet over and

1242
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,920
over again flipping back from from

1243
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,319
animal protein paleo back to plant-based

1244
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,040
back back to animal protein back to

1245
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:00,599
plant-based and you don't know where to

1246
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,240
go and you're not doing 32 ounces of

1247
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:03,400
celeries use every day to heal yourself

1248
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,800
and you're not doing all the things you

1249
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,680
need to do or you're afraid of

1250
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,000
supplements CU somebody said supplements

1251
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,240
are bad even though there are a lot of

1252
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,359
bad supplements don't get me wrong

1253
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,000
there's terrible supplements if you go

1254
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,160
to Medical medium.com you look at my

1255
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,079
directory you'll see the better

1256
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,520
supplements the ones that I trust that's

whatever it is a pescatarian whatever it

1513

is that somebody is or a Paleo or a new
