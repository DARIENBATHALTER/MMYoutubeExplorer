1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,460
we're doing a live meditation I'm

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,760
excited about this

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,620
Soul light infusion meditation so I

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,700
don't know if you guys heard the

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,260
meditation

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,880
the medical meeting podcast at Apple

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,760
podcast the soul light infusion

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,920
meditation right out of here

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,520
out of the protocols book

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,520
so

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,640
I thought it'd be really

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,740
I just thought it would be really nice

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,780
to just really go over this it's kind of

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,239
this is raw you know this is a

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,960
meditation live right now

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,059
if anybody gets on here and it's in the

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,340
middle of the meditation or you can

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,960
always listen to the video afterwards

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,100
but we're live right now which is this

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,160
is really fun

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,960
so the soul light meditation

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,360
is a special one

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,360
it's really powerful

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,520
and it came from SOC

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,079
but I want to also just address a few

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,760
things because I feel like it's my

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,820
responsibility

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,260
to make sure and I was talking to a

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,320
doctor friend he was telling me how he's

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,080
seeing more patients with the flu

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,119
flu season coming on we're going to go

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,720
into the holidays

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,820
immune systems get compromised

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,680
and so I was talking to Dr Freddie he

35
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,960
was like have you been telling your

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,580
people as I haven't had a chance I can

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,220
work you know working on the brain

38
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,560
challenge the brain shot challenge right

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,900
the brain shot therapies and all of that

40
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,119
and he said well just kind of remind

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,979
everybody I go I'm on it I'm on it

42
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,600
because it's true you know and I'm

43
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,060
starting to see a little bit of that too

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,060
out there so what I'm doing for myself

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,439
is I'm taking my zinc that's what I'm

46
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,479
doing

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm taking my

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,920
um my propolis that's what I'm doing

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,899
taking my vitamin C

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,820
which I'm getting low on

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,680
so it's going down

52
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,020
so

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,280
and the thing is is that and you know if

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,920
you guys just came on here right now

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,240
we're about to do a live meditation so

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm really excited about this so what

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,360
you could do is you can just relax you

58
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,180
can lay down you can just listen you

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,319
don't even have to look this way or

60
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,020
anything

61
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,720
so we we can do it this way which is

62
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,640
really cool never done it this way like

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,620
live right here right now

64
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,120
so I'm excited so I was talking about

65
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,260
the immune system though I've been

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,360
telling

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,060
I've been telling uh

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,120
um another friend of mine too who was

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,640
getting sick so it was like look

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,860
the zinc the whole bit the propolis

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,360
great for the immune system so I just

72
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,940
wanted to remind everybody about that

73
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,060
now these are the bemerjee products here

74
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,500
I fully endorsed this company because of

75
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,160
the four reasons

76
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,620
which are mind blowing like mind-blowing

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,720
for reasons you don't see anywhere else

78
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,860
in my opinion I have not seen it

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:06,239
anywhere else so the first reason is

80
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,739
that label requirements allow supplement

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,940
companies

82
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,819
to put ingredients inside their products

83
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,860
that they don't disclose

84
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,220
and bemerjee

85
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,760
they say no way we're never going to do

86
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,099
that If energy does not put in small

87
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,159
percentages of ingredients

88
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,680
hidden in their supplements

89
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,920
they will not do that that right there

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,099
blows me away because I cannot get a

91
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,659
supplement company to say that out there

92
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,940
I have not been able to find a

93
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:46,200
supplement company to say that

94
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,500
and save energy refuses to put a small

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,659
percentage of hidden ingredients

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,459
that they don't disclose

97
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,519
that right there

98
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,620
is unbelievable to me so label

99
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,120
requirements legally out there they make

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,640
it so supplement companies can put a

101
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,819
small percentage and hide it

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,440
and not disclose it in the products okay

103
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,879
so think about that

104
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,900
that's one thing right there if you guys

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
just got on here I'm talking about

106
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,480
immune system talking about the flu

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,699
coming we're going into the holidays the

108
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,340
other thing is Bemidji products are

109
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,340
third-party independently tested

110
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,580
third party

111
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,560
independently tested here's another

112
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,540
thing too remember the four reasons and

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,979
just going because people always asking

114
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,419
me about supplements and haven't had a

115
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,979
chance to even utter the word

116
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,320
supplements or something because things

117
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,440
have been so crazy but that right there

118
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,300
is mind-blowing okay and you'll see on

119
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,360
my directory at medicalmedium.com you'll

120
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,520
see how supplements kind of come and go

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,460
because they have free will and I can't

122
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
have them like do the right things so

123
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,419
that's why

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,280
they actually go in and out like that

125
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,500
and then use you won't see them on my

126
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,240
directory you won't see them because

127
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,400
people in supplement companies have

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,940
their own free will so going back to the

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,000
four big things about like why I fully

130
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,400
endorse themergy to the tilt

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,580
to the Tilt so one is the label

132
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,320
requirements well label label

133
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,699
requirements out there make it so

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
supplement companies don't have to

135
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,540
disclose hidden ingredients how insane

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,580
is that

137
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,580
the energy promises not to do that

138
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,800
that's incredible

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,780
another thing is vermigree products are

140
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,940
third party independently tested another

141
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,680
thing let's go to the third one

142
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
which is incredibly ready this one's

143
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
mind-blowing

144
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,539
and I can't find this for many companies

145
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,060
out there ready

146
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,639
femergy products

147
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,139
contain no alcohol

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
no soy

149
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,900
no gluten no citric acid and you see

150
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,039
citric acid and everything out there no

151
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,860
maltodextrin which is practically in

152
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,340
everything no magnesium steroid

153
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,039
no vinegar no caffeine yeah

154
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,680
no natural flavors

155
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,780
I can't even tell you how bad that is

156
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,580
no artificial flavors no titanium

157
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,400
dioxide

158
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,199
drop the mic if I could drop this mic

159
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,000
because I don't want to break it

160
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,259
this is a nice mic I don't want to break

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,419
it's a really nice mic drop the mic

162
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:23,400
the uh the fourth thing

163
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,539
I'm just letting everybody know the

164
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,220
fourth thing you won't find this

165
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,160
anywhere else I'm just telling you from

166
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,400
what I've ever seen the fourth thing

167
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,660
is that supplement companies to save

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,660
money

169
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,940
because it's about the bottom line

170
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,080
and the profit margin supplement

171
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,759
companies pick the lower quality tiers

172
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,020
when they're putting together their

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,180
supplements

174
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,520
they can still call it high quality

175
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,680
they're allowed to but they pick the

176
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,300
lower high quality

177
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,280
vemergy picks the highest to the degree

178
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,280
where they even have to have stuff like

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,620
grown for them

180
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,900
the highest

181
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,639
they don't care about the profit margin

182
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,800
highest

183
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,780
it goes down on record as being like the

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
best company in my opinion and so I

185
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,960
fully endorsed the best company I have

186
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,940
ever seen anywhere in supplementations

187
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,060
that's why I fully endorsement 100

188
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:24,000
billion percent so when I think about

189
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,900
those four things drop the mic mind

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
blown

you know when I don't have the flu or

201
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,639
anything I just do it that's the vitamin

202
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,400
D that's in my opinion the purest form

203
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,580
out there hands down I know people like

204
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,620

206
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,560

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,139
the the whole thing with the propolis is

209
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,060

549
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,940
on Instagram I have been taking B12 for

550
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,059
a while the doctor always said you are

551
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,940
low on B12 when I discovered mm started

552
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:31,860
on vimergy B12 just two weeks ago did

553
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,919
blood work doctor told me B12 was

554
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,400
perfect it matters with B12

555
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,980
November gb12 being the quality is

556
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,740
critical and

557
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,039
there's no soy alcohol gluten citric

558
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,620
acid hidden things maltodextrin steroid

559
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,179
vinegar or whatever caffeine nothing in

560
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,600
there

561
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,740
uh SOG Lily says vimergy feels right in

562
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,500
the body

563
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,500
well it's that it's the whole thing

564
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,480
about the four things that I talk about

565
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,000
it's critical

566
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,580
Mark says I had no idea companies were

567
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,140
allowed to not disclose ingredients

568
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:16,860
that is exactly how it is companies are

569
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,039
able to hide ingredients up to a certain

570
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:23,220
percentage the law allows it

571
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,659
so label requirements allow companies to

572
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,720
not have to disclose all the little

573
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,620
hidden stuff in small percentages

574
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,460
beverages says they're not going to do

575
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,100
that

576
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,080
that alone is like drop the mic

577
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,700
I don't want to drop this one

578
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,860
it's really nice Mike

579
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,179
Brenda says vimergy supplements has made

580
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,820
a huge difference in my healing

581
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:44,520
difference in my healing and that's what

582
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,980
that's what's critical is having that

583
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,799
happen in your life Marissa spiritual

584
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,480
hey Marissa I truly notice a difference

585
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,820
in my health and healing when I was

586
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,340
without propolis for weeks I felt so

587
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,799
much once I was able to so much better

588
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,860
once I was able to have it again

589
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,500
it's in my state it's my staple in my

590
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,659
life all the time like regardless of

591
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,399
what I'm doing I'm always using the

592
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,799
memory probe was

593
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,380
Robin says I never took a vitamin I

594
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,320
could feel working like Imaging

595
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,260
and thousands feel that way it's that

596
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,039
important to have that it really is

597
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,559
all these things matter they just do and

598
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,840

any company

606
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,740
and and I'm proud to do that because I

607
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,320
want this stuff to be here I want the

608
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,500
stuff to stick around because we have to

609
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,200
have options that actually matter

610
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,419
it's no joke Claudia says I love the

611
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,820
meditation thank you so much I'm kind of

612
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:02,039
dizzy you're a little bit dizzy from the

613
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,260
meditation I would just sit that kick

614
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:07,980
back and relax

615
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,960
and uh Clement bomb just totally chilled

616
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,299
me out and that's what it does I take it

617
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,520
when I want to just I just want to

618
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,700
actually smooth out

619
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,200
see Leo Miller says since I started to

620
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,120
read the ingredients on the label

621
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,220
there's almost nothing to buy at the

622
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,740
stores it's insane how poisonous

623
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,840
everything on the product shelves are

624
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,880
what what I find is there's natural

625
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,159
flavors and everything which you guys

626
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,559
heard my natural flavors show probably

627
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,600
on medical medium podcast setup a

628
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,220
podcast natural flavors and all this

629
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,340
other stuff that's in their citric acid

630
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,140
and all this other junk and the image

631
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,679
you won't do that

632
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,960
and so they they had they adhere to a

633
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,200
standard that I can't find anywhere

634
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,140
it's it's on all levels though with them

635
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,480
it's just incredible

636
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,220

641
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,299

Elena says aw how much problems you take

645
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,899
you could take what's on that stuff is

646
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,460
so incredible you could take what's just

647
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:23,640
right on the bottle

648
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,039
it's amazing that's the micro C right

649
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,080
there I'm running low

650
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:32,580
had that bottle for a while

651
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,200
Denise said vimergy is the best memory G

652
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,760
is the best been on these supplements

653
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,500
for 15 months

654
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,659
incredible

655
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,100
and I'm so proud of you too because you

656
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:44,000
know when you stay with something and

657
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,000
keep it in your routine

658
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,320
so yeah it's just it's just amazing so I

659
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,360
wanted to tell you guys about that so

660
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,799
with the flu and everything coming and

661
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,260
all that if you watch this from the

662
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,520
beginning I talked about that so I was

663
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,779
talking to a doctor friend he was like

664
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,659
aren't you supposed to be telling your

665
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,240
people because it's it's happening

666
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,919
is very much he so here's a comment is

667
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,200
memory better than an injection for

668
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,659
vitamin B12 if you read the medical

669
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,399
medium books you can learn a lot about

670
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,720
that so

671
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,700
you can take a look at the medical mean

672
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,980
books and learn a lot about that Patty

673
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,380
says meditation brought tears to my eyes

674
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,500
I feel a high level of Soul healing

675
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,659
going on excited for future meditations

676
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,120
I want to offer everything I can offer

677
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,799
that comes from above so you have these

678
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,440
tools

679
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,240
Kelly Burke says I didn't notice a

680
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,799
difference with my body pain until I

681
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,960
started taking beverages propolis

682
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,100
Nature's answer didn't even touch it now

683
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,019
I'm not going to mention any other

684
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,720
company names or anything like that I'm

685
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:44,519
just saying that

686
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,580
that I'll tell you right now the memory

687
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,299
propolis is unlike anything there is and

688
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,380
there's a reason though there's a reason

689
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:54,440
number one

690
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,140
there's no alcohol

691
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:00,059
but companies still can have alcohol in

692
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,820
their propolis

693
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,200
regardless and remember she doesn't have

694
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,840
that's number one just so you know

695
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,300
number two is

696
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,960
the propolis that they actually

697
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,760
Harvest that's harvested for it I'm just

698
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,960
saying that nothing nothing's like it

699
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,659
out there I mean I don't even know

700
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,200
there's no words actually

701
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,960
see a pregrino says I have reversed all

702
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,080
of my symptoms from your information

703
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,460
I mean that's everything

704
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,480
when you have symptoms and you're

705
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,339
struggling and all that that's

706
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,240
incredible

707
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:38,960
I'm proud of you truly proud of you

708
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,960

709
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,560
you know I just want you guys to know

710
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,139
how it works out there I think that's

711
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,300
what has happened over the years is I've

712
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,480
always told you guys how things work out

713
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,220

714
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,480
that stuff that happens out there and

715
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,859
that's one of the things I've been able

716
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,500
to tell you guys and teach you guys

717
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:00,000
through the books and the information

718
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,680
Marissa spiritual said this was amazing

719
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,140
Anthony my husband joined me for the

720
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,380

God bless you guys that's amazing really

722
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,400
Rose Jackson says doing that meditation

723
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,700
collectively just then with the

724
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,460
community was very heartwarming oh it is

725
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,040
really heartwarming it truly is

726
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,540
it really is Carrie Llewellyn says thank

727
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,000
you so much Anthony such a beautiful

728
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,540
meditation I feel totally relaxed and

729
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,720
sleepy again I feel relaxed because I

730
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,280
got my lemon

731
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,619
balmergillon bomb which is a whole other

732
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,660
thing by the way it's really potent too

733
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,300
which is incredible

734
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,339
the potency is just off the charts which

735
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,260
is what I really love

736
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:46,079
which is incredible and I don't have to

737
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,680
worry I don't have to be in fear knowing

738
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,300
that companies or this company is hiding

739
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,579
a certain percentage of ingredients

740
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,320
because they're allowed to do that

741
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,760
right companies are allowed to hide a

742
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,960
certain small percentage of ingredients

743
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,220
that are hidden in here that I don't

744
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,660
even know what they are I don't have to

745
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,339
have fear

746
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,260
I don't have to think well what is that

747
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:06,000
is it MSG is it something else like

748
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,520
what's hid I don't have to think that

749
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,200
like it gives me peace and the one thing

750
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,480
I can tell you right now and why I fully

751
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,300
endorse Bemidji is because I I want to

752
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,220
have peace in my heart and my soul and I

753
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,980
want to be able to feel that energy and

754
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,740
have peace that I'm not being tricked or

755
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,020
something isn't not disclosed in the

756
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,579
supplement like I don't I don't I have a

757
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,020

it's it's like this okay

787
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,460

top themergy

789
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,460

790
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,960
those products if it can top it I

791
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,700
haven't seen it yet there is no company

792
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,040
in my opinion that can top it and I'm

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,740
waiting and I haven't seen anything

821
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,680
incredible

822
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,119
I love this meditation it's powerful and

823
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,640
there's other meditations in the brain

824
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,099
saver books when you guys see him you'll

825
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,640
see them I mean how incredible Allison

826
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:08,040
says I've I'm zoned out

827
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,900

828
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,660
Cold Light spring says I can't believe

829
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:17,700
you did this meditation now

830
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:21,960
it may it was it was really special

831
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:24,660
when do I do that when do I do that

832
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,060
Babylon says vemergy is literally the

833
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,040
only brand I'll take you can feel its

834
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,119
energy instantly in your body made with

835
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,780
love

836
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,060
there's a reason why it's because when

837
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,160
they choose the highest tier instead of

838
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,260
the lower high qualities here there's a

839
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,720
high high quality tier companies don't

840
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,420
choose those High tiers because it costs

841
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,380
too much and so they they but vimorigi

842
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,880
doesn't care about the bottom line

843
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,280
profit margin they just want to make

844
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,380
sure they get the highest quality there

845
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,380
is that's why part of why you feel it

846
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:59,040
another thing is there's no there's no

847
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,300
you know hidden undisclosed gradients

848
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,940
and stuff like that all kinds of stuff

849
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:04,800
Carrie Llewellyn says vimergy microc is

850
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,300
the only vitamin C I can take that does

851
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,380
not irritate my stomach that's the whole

852
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,320
point I'm going to tell you right now

853
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,859
that it's the only buffered one like

854
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,839
buffered it's not ascorbic acid and

855
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:18,000
that's critical

856
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,160
that's critical I have a lot of doctor

857
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,260
friends that are using the micro C now

858
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,300
because it's they're learning that when

859
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,119
they give their patients ascorbic acid

860
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,420
like straight ascorbic acid

861
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,680
they get the funny tummy and so I have a

862
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,260
lot of doctor friends that are actually

863
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,700
like learning about using the

864
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,700
non-ascorbic acid

865
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,420
I mean all this stuff matters who does

866
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,619
this like who does this well companies

867
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,240
do this

868
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,880
it's insane

869
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,520
Darcy Lee Womack says my daughter is

870
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,680

871
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,660
