00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,720
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,560
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,400
one of them whether you're dealing with

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,880
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,200
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,559
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,719
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,840
Williams we're talking about parasites

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,520
that's right parasites but really we're

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,000
talking about the parasitical scam now

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,039
if you're somebody that believes in

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,519
parasites there's nothing wrong with

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,760
that because parasites are real

20
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,080
yes they are

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,280
indeed in fact a piece of meat sitting

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,759
out in the sun during a picnic will

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,159
collect a lot of different microbes a

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,159
lot of different food born

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,400
illnesses just like egg salad can't

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,600
leave egg salad in the sun either

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,720
because something will happen the

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,560
mayonnaise the Mayo those eggs sitting

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,960
out there something bad will happen to

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,200
them you can get really sick very sick

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,320
sick very ill you can't eat uncooked

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,280
chicken uncooked turkey why because you

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,119
can die yes you can die and they can't

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,079
just eat raw meat because there could be

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,240
a parasite on there without a doubt that

36
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,719
parasite can really hurt you there also

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,600
could be some bad bacteria there too yes

38
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,280
parasites are real but so is the

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,280
parasite scam

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,640
if you're someone that's been told you

41
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,239
have parasites or you have a parasite

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
and now you're going to be dedicating

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,840
all your time and energy doing

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,360
parasitical cleanses chasing parasites

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,280
looking at parasite info out there and

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,000
making your whole life about a parasite

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,280
you might want to listen to this episode

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,319
to start with the parasite biohack

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,000
movement has been around it was around

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,959
years ago and many of the earlier

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,480
chronically old people people with

52
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,080
mysterious chronic illness got into the

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,720
parasite movement they were looking for

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,560
answers and they tried everything and so

55
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,680
hearing that parasites could be their

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,840
problem lured them in it was the next

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,360
flashy thing the next shiny object they

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,000
went into it thinking whoa I'm going to

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,519
be fixed I'm going to be cured but it

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,480
didn't work people didn't get cured they

61
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,239
didn't get fixed in fact they got sicker

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,200
they were doing all kinds of intestinal

63
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,159
cleansers intestinal cleansers that are

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,720
out there now bentonite clay different

65
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,440
Clays thinking they were ridding

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,280
parasites they were trying to get

67
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,640
parasites out of their intestinal tract

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,319
they were using wormwood shillig fulvic

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,239
minerals fulvic acid sodium bicarbonate

70
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,640
and chlorine dioxide simultaneously as

71
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:30,159
all this was happening during this time

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,680
the Lyme disease movement was shifting

73
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,879
no longer was it just bacteria it was

74
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,200
hybrids now hybrids such as babesia

75
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,560
babesia wasn't considered a bacteria it

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,080
was considered a parasite although that

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:48,439
is a debate still worth having to begin

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,200
with they never found babesia they never

79
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,079
found barnella and they never found

80
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,680
bellia but yet these were the bacteria

81
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,239
and parasitical hybrids that were being

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,519
touted at the time so as the Lyme

83
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,319
disease moved M was growing into that

84
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,560
there was the parasitical movement on

85
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,840
the other end of the spectrum they were

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,040
working off of each other but still all

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,760
in the wrong direction when someone had

88
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,959
a blood test looking for lime bacteria

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,400
the lime bacteria was never found

90
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,919
instead it was an inflammatory marker

91
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,240
test but nobody knew that at that time

92
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,320
they still don't know it today medical

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,440
medium information exposed it so Lyme

94
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,759
disease took a turn and it went for

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,960
co-actors it was was all about co-actors

96
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,479
co-actor parasites like hybrids like

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,960
babesia so both the health movement at

98
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,720
the time a small batch of people were

99
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,199
focused on parasites while at the same

100
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,479
time a small batch of doctors were

101
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,960
focused on parasites with Lyme disease

102
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,639
aesia and it never got anybody anywhere

103
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,680
the people with thyroid disease and

104
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,560
chronic illness and vertigo and

105
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,000
dizziness and aches and pains and

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,000
Tremors and Shakes and ticks and spasms

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,840
and Restless leg syndrome and back pain

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,800
foot pain neck pain and severe severe

109
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,840
fatigue weren't being fixed by either

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,039
side the protocols for Lyme disease were

111
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,680
intense harsh antibiotics and the

112
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,280
protocols for so-called parasite issues

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,479
in the health movement were cleansers

114
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,759
cleansing products Clays intestinal

115
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,960
Clays shiled fulvic minerals fulvic acid

116
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,199
chlorine dioxide sodium bicarbonate quop

colostrum warmwood and alkaline ionizer

119
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,160
water and nothing worked people stayed

120
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,360
sick they were chronically ill lots of

121
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,479
mysterious symptoms people went through

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,280
the machine they went through the meat

123
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,560
grinder they had nowhere to go nothing

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,560
was working one reason it wasn't

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,600
parasites parasites were not why people

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,280
were sick with chronic illness but

127
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,000
parasites made sense to people it made

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,400
sense to them this m mysterious weird

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,360
creature Critter living inside of a

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,520
person it made a lot of sense it was a

131
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,720
fly trap it brought people in left and

132
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,520
right parasitical cleanses were huge

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,599
they were huge because people were

134
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,880
thinking that was the answer but they

135
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,520
tried them been there done that and it

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,720
didn't fix people hordes of people so

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,319
then the parasitical world started to

138
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,360
die that's right in the health movement

139
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,840
it started to die it fell off the map

140
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,759
and was taken over it was taken over

141
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,919
once again by Candida by Fungus it was

142
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,240
taken over once again by Sugar Sugar

143
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,120
being the problem sugar fruit fear took

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,599
it over so new thing started fruit fear

145
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,919
sugar sugar was the cause of everybody's

146
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,639
chronic illness everybody believed it

147
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,199
everybody was told it here to high

148
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,360
heaven it was all about sugar parasites

149
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,840
took the back seat died off

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,960
sugar was the evildoer it was the evil

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,680
one it was Satan to everybody everybody

152
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:14,160
was afraid of sugar and every shape

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,120
fashion or form fruit was evil was very

154
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,680
frightening and along with the fruit

155
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,440
fear came the protein deficiencies

156
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,599
you're not getting enough protein that's

157
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,319
why you're sick that's got to be the

158
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:28,319
answer you're not getting enough protein

159
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,199
so you're dying so you're fatigued so

160
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,160
you're having chronic illness

161
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,800
you must be protein deficient and at the

162
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,280
same time years ago a new storm was

163
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,599
occurring oxalates oxyc acid everybody

164
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
was starting to believe that was the

165
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
cause of their illness that's why they

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
had chronic illness that's why they were

167
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,240
in wheelchairs that's why they were sick

168
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,520
that's why they couldn't function it's

169
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,520
why they had add that's why they had

170
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,599
brain fog it must have been oxyc acid

171
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,240
oxalates that was the big one it covered

172
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,960
up the parasitical craze parasitical

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,720
craze died oxyc acid arrived candida

174
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,599
came back and protein was God and then

175
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,680
an upsurge of alkaline water so

176
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
everybody who's chronically sick ended

177
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,520
up buying the alkaline ionizer water

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,159
machines thinking this would be the fix

179
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,680
all that this would take care of it but

180
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,199
the machines ended up in the closets

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,879
everybody's closets people couldn't give

182
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,919
them away fast enough because they were

183
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,879
getting worse drinking the water water

184
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,640
even from the best machines that are out

185
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,760
there today they didn't know that the

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,399
metal plates inside the machines were

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,120
corroding just like they do today and

188
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:46,440
will always do the corrosion released

189
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,880
oxidation micro particles of metals

190
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,000
entering into people so that wasn't the

191
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,279
answer either and still isn't the answer

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,760
today but back then they had their day

193
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,440
their upsurge and then the alkaline

194
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,800
ionizer and water machine died it

195
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,600
exceeded and fell back just like the

196
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,079
parasite World in fact all of these

197
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,720
things fell back and died and there was

198
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,560
a great big hole in the health world the

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,399
health movement people sick and

200
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,279
exhausted tried everything been there

201
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,440
done that nothing worked and they were

202
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,640
all sick chronic illness was on the rise

203
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,160
people didn't have answers to why they

204
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,640
were even sick and biohacks of that era

205
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,640
were on life support Maybe maybe you

206
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,839
were there maybe this has meaning to you

207
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,160
maybe you tried everything done that

208
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,880
been there and maybe this is all just

209
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,279
new to you but it's important to know

210
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,200
imperative to know when it comes down to

211
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,600
being sick and healing it's important to

212
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,560
know that the parasitical scam was here

213
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,480
before and it's here now again and no

214
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,240
disrespect to anyone it doesn't mean

215
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,720
someone's trying to truly scam someone a

216
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,760
lot of people could have their heart in

217
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,160
it they could have invest ments in it

218
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,760
time money energy and truly believe in

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,600
what they're doing and some could be

220
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,279
scamming people because that's the

221
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,279
industry now it's a dog eat dog world

222
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,440
now let's talk about parasites and get

223
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:20,600
deeper into it parasites are real they

224
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,839
exist they're on every single raw piece

225
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,000
of beef raw piece of chicken they're all

226
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,480
over packages in the grocery store

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,880
there's parasites all over packages

228
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,720
around meat and pork and chicken and

229
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,880
fish if you go into a grocery store and

230
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,560
you buy some fish that's wrapped in

231
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,920
plastic in a container or some pork or

232
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
some beef it'll be on the outside of the

233
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,160
container there'll be parasites all over

234
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,800
the outside and in a display case you

235
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,720
see fish of all kinds seafood or another

236
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
display case where you see organ meats

237
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,560
and pork and chicken and grass-fed beef

238
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,800
there's parasites everywhere everywhere

239
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,240
all over it

240
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,240
all kinds of different microbes bad

241
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,920
microbes not good microbes and from a

242
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,959
scale 1 to 10 some of those parasites

243
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
could be extremely

244
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,160
dangerous some of them could be very

245
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,639
mild now the mild ones get killed off

246
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,959
easy in your gut all you need is just a

247
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,959
little bit of HCL a little bit of

248
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,680
hydrochloric acid naturally inside your

249
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,000
stomach produced by your stomach glands

250
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,639
and that hydrochloric acid is your

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,880
parasitical killer in fact you eat

252
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,160
parasites often and don't know it your

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,600
HCL is killing and destroying those

254
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,079
parasites there's parasites on people's

255
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,560
hands there's parasites on door handles

256
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,320
there's parasites in bathrooms and

257
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,560
bathroom sink handles there's parasites

258
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,079
in restaurants on food you ordered and

259
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,480
most all of these parasites don't bother

260
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,839
anybody because they they die off they

261
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,920
get killed off they get killed off fast

262
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,480
sometimes just in our

263
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,320
mouths sometimes in our stomach

264
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,600
sometimes in our dadum and even in our

265
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,560
small intestinal tract but they die off

266
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,839
they get killed these parasites that we

267
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,600
actually eat a lot of and don't even

268
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,360
realize it or get exposed to it a lot

269
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,079
die off they don't stick around they

270
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,560
don't stay anywhere they don't stay in

271
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,160
the liver they don't stay in the

272
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,480
intestinal tract they don't stay in the

273
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,600
stomach they don't stay in the rectum

274
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,560
they don't stay anywhere these parasites

275
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,560
come and they go as fast as they came

276
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,079
they die and our immune system has a big

277
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,199
part involved with killing them our

278
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,440
immune cells love parasites they feed

279
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:52,880
off of them they destroy them they

280
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,160
gobble them up they break them apart and

281
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,279
they discard them and all of this is

282
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,199
happening when you don't even know it

283
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,199
you're not even aware of it you're

284
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:08,120
immune system destroys level one level 2

285
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:09,800
3 4 5 level six level seven parasites

286
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,079
now keep in mind there's hundreds of

287
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,279
varieties of parasites not registered

288
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:19,839
not documented there are thousands of

289
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:22,519
varieties of different forms of microbes

290
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,920
and parasites and they all fall under

291
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:28,399
the parasite umbrella and science

292
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,160
doesn't care there's no money involved

293
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,880
there's no money to be made research in

294
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,160
science doesn't study them they're aware

295
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,440
they exist they're aware there's a lot

296
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,320
of microbes out there many harmless many

297
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,519
not harmless and many dangerous yes

298
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,680
dangerous level 8 n 10 and Beyond very

299
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,720
dangerous can kill someone that's right

300
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,360
can kill someone so let's get into that

301
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,040
a little bit you go down to Mexico and

302
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,600
you drink the water in a basin or a

303
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,360
ravine or a canal or a pond and you

304
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,639
drink that water you're not going

305
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,839
anywhere you'd be lucky if you made it

306
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,639
home because you picked up a parasite

307
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,079
that's right a parasite a real parasite

308
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,320
floating around in dirty water swimming

309
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,680
around in dirty water an amoeba or some

310
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,000
other form of parasite sitting in that

311
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,040
water and if you drink it you'll be

312
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
lucky if you can get home and most

313
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,680
likely you'll just end up in the

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,839
hospital and you'll be in there fighting

315
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,199
for your life with dis

316
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,160
a broad term for some type of food

317
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:38,759
poisoning or parasitical infection now

318
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,360
with this parasitical infection you have

319
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:45,279
to win yes you have to heal you have to

320
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,920
get better what that means is you can't

321
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:52,160
live with it your body won't allow you

322
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,240
to live with a parasite so it's kill or

323
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:58,040
be killed it's either the parasite kills

324
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,759
you which happens to a lot of people or

325
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,199
your body kills kills the parasite but

326
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,839
you can't live with it long term you

327
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,800
can't be somebody with chronic illness

328
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,040
going for years and years thinking

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
you've had a parasitical infection a

330
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,959
chronic parasitical infection all these

331
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,279
years and that's your problem because

332
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,399
it's not you can't live with a parasite

333
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,480
in your system your body has to kill it

334
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,240
and that killing of it is the war and

335
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,959
that war is sickness in the moment death

336
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,560
defying sickness for a lot of people or

337
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:35,360
difficult sickness for a lot of people

338
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,680
or mild sickness for a lot of people but

339
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,839
it's only temporary it's you win or the

340
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,839
bug wins you win or the parasite wins

341
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,319
it's not I'm sick for 10 years whoa I

342
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,560
just learned that maybe if I do a

343
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:52,000
parasite cleanse that that'll fix it

344
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,800
because I must have a parasite nope

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,519
that's not how it works that you win or

346
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,279
the parasite wins same thing if you end

347
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,000
up with food poisoning you eat in a

348
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:08,199
restaurant something was in the food

349
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,920
some food born pathogen yes a parasite a

350
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:13,680
food born pathogen a parasite and you

351
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,639
eat that and now you're sick you're

352
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,240
throwing up you're vomiting you have

353
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,040
diarrhea you have the runs it won't stop

354
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,800
you're in tremendous pain Agony the

355
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,000
worst kind you try to push through a day

356
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,519
goes by you're going through the vomits

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
again you're going through the runs

358
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,800
again you're going through the diarrhea

359
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,800
is again and you can't get better

360
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,360
something's wrong getting dehydrated now

361
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,519
you're at the hospital you're hooked up

362
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,759
to an IV and they put you on some kind

363
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:43,319
of pain killer maybe even morphine to

364
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,959
dumb down the pain and you try to rest

365
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:48,480
while your immune system tries to kill

366
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,360
off whatever that food born pathogen is

367
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,720
whatever that parasite is because the

368
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,399
war is on it's not about living

369
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,040
simultaneously living in harmony living

370
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,959
in some way down the road together

371
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,480
doesn't work like that the bug the food

372
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:08,880
born pathogen has to be killed same

373
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,799
thing with aggressive forms of eoli that

374
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
aren't the normal forms of eoli the

375
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,880
aggressive foodborn varieties they have

376
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,039
to be killed you can't live with them so

377
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,760
you lay in the hospital while your body

378
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:26,360
fights for its life while your immune

379
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:29,400
system fights for your life while the

380
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,640
doctors can't do anything about it sides

381
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,919
keep you hydrated keep you plugged into

382
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,280
a salt bag to an IV and then give you

383
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,720
painkillers so you can rest and try to

384
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,120
get some sleep allowing your body to

385
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,640
heal and that is foodborn pathogens

386
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,480
that's food poisoning That's parasites

387
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,960
those are parasites that are aggressive

388
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,960
and they can come in any old shape and

389
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,960
size because there's hundreds of them

390
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,400
and thousands of them and most of them

391
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,000
harmless because we kill them off fast

392
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,919
our HCL kills them the more aggressive

393
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,320
the parasite the less chance our HCL can

394
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
kill them especially if our HCL

395
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,880
hydrochloric acid is weakened in a

396
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,400
weakened State our stomach glands aren't

397
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,000
producing good HCL we've been drinking

398
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,440
coffee for years our stomach glands are

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,559
wasted we have adrenaline surges from

400
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,799
fight or flight maybe we have vicces

401
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,919
that actually cause adrenaline surges

402
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,280
that burn out our gastric glands and the

403
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,600
CL is not there it's not strong enough

404
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,080
it's not at the quantity or the level it

405
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,000
needs to be so pathogens Escape they

406
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,360
bypass the stomach they enter the dadum

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,320
and down into the intestinal tract they

408
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,280
could even find their way into the liver

409
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,760
if they can't be stopped now these are

410
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:57,159
parasitical pathogens foodborn pathogens

411
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,000
parasites not viruses not stealth

412
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:02,320
viruses not multi udes of bacteria and

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,559
different forms of bacteria like strep

414
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,520
these are food related bugs these are

415
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:12,360
water related bugs dirty water stagnant

416
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,120
Still Water food poisoning and food

417
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,559
poisoning stories you see and hear out

418
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,039
there all the time and they're even in

419
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,760
the media now where three members of a

420
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:23,360
family die and they die before they even

421
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,919
get to the hospital or they die in the

422
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,799
hospital one dies at home two die in the

423
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,600
hospital this happens all the time

424
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,679
that's parasites really aggressive ones

425
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,559
and it's you or the parasite you go down

426
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,960
or the parasite goes down there's no

427
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,919
other way it's not something you live

428
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,720
with from here on out where you improve

429
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:47,840
in the hospital and now you're better

430
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,080
enough to get out of the hospital now

431
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,360
you're home and you're sick because you

432
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,320
still have the parasite or you still

433
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,360
have the parasite for weeks and weeks

434
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,240
and months and months now you might be

435
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,320
injured and triggered by a par partical

436
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,559
infection which leaves you sick for

437
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,280
years after a situation like this but

438
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,960
you don't have the parasite anymore you

439
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,799
know how you know you don't have the

440
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,880
parasite anymore you're still standing

441
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,320
you're still breathing because you would

442
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,200
have died the parasite would have killed

443
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:23,480
you milder parasites and food born

444
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:27,640
pathogens food born illness food born

445
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,360
parasites milder less aggressive ones

446
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,120
you kill fast your HCL and your immune

447
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,960
cells kill and destroy quickly and you

448
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,000
move on it could be one bat of diarrhea

449
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,480
it could be one bout of vomiting and

450
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,080
then you're good and maybe just a rough

451
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,120
night you're good the next day you start

452
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
picking up your pace and you're back to

453
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,679
normal or you don't even know what

454
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,760
happened your body killed it off real

455
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,240
fast you got strong

456
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,600
HC strong immune system immune cells and

457
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,320
it was annihilated and annihilated with

458
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,559
within the hour or half an hour after

459
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,799
eating or getting exposure or getting

460
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,559
some tainted water or getting something

461
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,000
in your mouth that led to this but

462
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,360
somebody sick for 20 years with chronic

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,039
illness with different symptoms and

464
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,480
conditions and neurological problems are

465
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:22,080
not living with a parasite this is a

466
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,559
misguided Mistake by people in the

467
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,960
health movement that have no idea why

468
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,760
people are sick still even though they

469
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,120
seem qualified or they know a lot about

470
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,279
vaccines or they know a lot about all

471
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,240
kinds of different problems in health or

472
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:39,240
food chemicals or processed foods and

473
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,600
they're all talking a good game they

474
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,159
still don't know why chronically ill

475
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,360
people are chronically ill but it seems

476
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,039
logical it seems like it makes sense if

477
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,120
I was somebody sick with all kinds of

478
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,760
neurological problems and different

479
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,960
symptoms and I heard maybe it's

480
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,559
parasitical and a parasite and I thought

481
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,640
well my doctors probably don't know I've

482
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,320
been to 50 doctors in the last 8 years

483
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,640
and maybe this is the answer I have a

484
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,799
parasite surely that's what it must be

485
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,240
it sounds like it everybody's talking

486
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,240
about it that must be what I have and

487
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,480
you could be somebody that's like whoa I

488
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,240
got sick last year it's probably a

489
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,279
parasite from all the information I'm

490
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,559
seeing out there now without realizing

491
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,039
what happened 20 years ago 15 years ago

492
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:32,480
12 years ago

493
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,559
25 years ago not knowing about the

494
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:38,400
parasitical understanding the trend how

495
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,600
it works and the parasite scam what

496
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
people are really living with what

497
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,960
they're really dealing with are

498
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,520
pathogens yes but stealth

499
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,840
viruses that's what they've always been

500
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,919
living and dealing with it's stealth

501
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,679
viruses epscene bar shingles

502
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,000
hhv6

503
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:03,159
hhv7 different variety of herpes of all

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,799
kinds undiscovered varieties plus

505
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:09,200
simplex one Simplex 2 people are living

506
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,880
with multiple varieties of these at one

507
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,320
time two varieties of epine bar a

508
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,840
variety of shingles and a cold sore

509
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:23,279
virus herpes simplex 1 all at the same

510
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,000
time along with bacteria strep varieties

511
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:30,520
some people can pick up over a lifetime

512
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,840
10 15 20 varieties strep some aggressive

513
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,440
causing chronic

514
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,480
sinusitis causing mucus in their chest

515
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,600
in their lungs causing severe acne UTI

516
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,600
kidney infections bladder infections BV

517
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,200
bacterial vaginosis and living with

518
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,840
difficult strep varieties that are

519
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,200
antibiotic resistance not just one

520
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,799
antibiotic resistance strain but

521
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,400
multiple and some people have a little

522
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,760
bit of everything they'll have some

523
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,400
strep other varieties of bacteria too

524
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,679
they'll have sta maybe some SEI maybe

525
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,559
they'll have two Epstein bars and they

526
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,159
can live miserable because there's

527
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,240
different varieties of these bugs some

528
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,360
more aggressive some milder depending on

529
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,960
the person's immune system their

530
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,840
deficiencies are they zinc deficient are

531
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,480
they B12 deficient and so forth people

532
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,640
have chronic illness because of

533
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,679
pathogens they also have chronic illness

534
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,640
because of toxic heavy metals both

535
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,960
metals and pathogens equal chronic

536
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:32,679
illness chronic mystery long-term

537
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,559
illness and autoimmune where do

538
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:39,320
parasites fit in with all this

539
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:41,880
nowhere they don't fit in anywhere

540
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,720
parasites are a problem that when you

541
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,840
get one has to be killed off your body

542
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,279
has to do it that's the fight for your

543
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,039
life if it's a mild parasite very

544
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,399
minimal issues can occur you may not

545
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,360
even know you had a parasite your HCL

546
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,720
killed it and it's gone medical medium

547
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,880
information broke barriers the discovery

548
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,520
of all these different viruses stealth

549
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,760
living in US causing neurological

550
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,720
symptoms it changed everything in health

551
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,679
people found answers and they knew what

552
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,919
kind of protocols to use to heal and

553
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,200
those protocols were entirely different

554
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,760
than the trends of yester year of years

555
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,480
ago the opposite of fulvic minerals

556
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,760
fulvic acid Bentonite Clays and other

557
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,440
different clays chillig apple ceter

558
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,000
vinegar chlorophyll alkaline water

559
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:38,440
chlorine dioxide sodium bicarbonate

560
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,399
charcoal colostrum just to name a few

561
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,320
these never worked they didn't work for

562
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,600
people years ago they don't work for

563
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,520
people today and part of the reason why

564
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,000
so many people are healing from chronic

565
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,520
illness is the things that do work the

566
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,840
medical medium information that brought

567
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:00,440
in olive leaf licorice propolis golden

568
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,399
seal Elderberry zinc vitamin C B12 cats

569
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,039
claw and many other tools turned people

570
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:08,720
around got their lives back with chronic

571
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:11,399
symptoms neurological symptoms because

572
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,880
it was based on killing off pathogens

573
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:16,799
medical medium information killing off

574
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,039
stealth viruses like Epstein bar that's

575
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,120
how people got their lives back they got

576
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,440
their lives back back then and they're

577
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,720
getting their lives back now but the

578
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,840
parasitical world is upsurging again and

579
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,159
they're talking the same game

580
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,159
same game as yester year of decades ago

581
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
they're talking about parasites when

582
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,520
that's not what people are suffering

583
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,919
with that's not why people can't think

584
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,679
with their brain fog have Alzheimer's

585
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,200
dementia memory problems have ticks and

586
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,520
spasms aches and pains neurological

587
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,480
symptoms Galore restless leg syndrome

588
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,360
balance issues dizziness vertigo tunitis

589
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,399
it's not why people are sick but it's a

590
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,080
good lur they bring them in they get

591
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:04,240
them to listen because you have people a

592
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:07,520
whole new batch of people new bees new

593
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,000
sick bees they're there they're sick now

594
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
they don't know why they're sick they

595
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,360
already went through the merrygoround a

596
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,360
little bit they've already went from

597
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,000
Doctor to doctor they don't have answers

598
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,000
and parasites seem perfect it only makes

599
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,520
sense so they follow these doctors and

600
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
follow these practitioners and these

601
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,200
health coaches and the influencers and

602
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,559
they think they have parasites but some

603
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,840
something's changed about the

604
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,360
parasitical protocols they're a little

605
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,640
different and even a lot different now

606
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,679
they have pieces of medical medium

607
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,840
information they have medical medium

608
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,559
tools they have lemon bomb they got B12

609
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,840
they got zinc interesting they didn't

610
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,480
have that before they didn't have that

611
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,720
before the medical medium books and the

612
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
medical medium information they only had

613
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,200
their schillig they only had their

614
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,240
fulvic minerals fulvic acid their sodium

615
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,120
bicarbonate their alkaline water their

616
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,960
chlorophyll they only had those they

617
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,039
didn't have anything else but now you

618
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,840
hear cats claw out there that's

619
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,559
interesting it's a medical medium tool

620
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,080
for chronic illness and neurological

621
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,760
diseases and conditions and symptoms can

622
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,200
that be a good thing they're poaching

623
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,960
medical medium tools but using it for

624
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,240
parasites it could be good in the way

625
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,559
where someone might get a benefit they

626
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,399
might actually get a little window into

627
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,519
healing but it'll be stopped instantly

628
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,000
when they offer something that is toxic

629
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,360
or doesn't work and it goes against it

630
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,559
they use a medical medium tool goes with

631
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,039
the grain then they use something highly

632
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,880
toxic goes against the grain and then

633
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,720
people just don't really truly get

634
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,640
better and they believe they have

635
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,399
parasites when they don't and that's sad

636
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,279
because we're not making the progress we

637
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:52,399
need to make we need to know why we're

638
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,480
sick we need to know why we have

639
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,880
neurological symptoms we need to

640
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,200
understand that and then we need the

641
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,159
tools to fix it the medical medium

642
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,960
information about what pathogens what

643
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,799
stealth viruses what bacteria what toxic

644
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,240
heavy

645
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,720
metals what other poisons what other

646
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,279
toxins what other exposures and what

647
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,679
about the tools we need the right tools

648
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,840
for the right problems having the

649
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,720
answers matter instead of chasing our

650
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,000
Tails having little tidbits is fun but

651
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,159
we're just playing the game and when it

652
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,159
comes down to health time matters

653
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,480
wasting time matters we have to be able

654
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:35,720
to heal we need to be doing things that

655
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,080
are working we need to understand why

656
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,519
we're sick to begin with and that's the

657
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,840
sad thing people they don't know they

658
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,200
don't know why they're sick with these

659
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,480
mystery symptoms they're hearing tidbits

660
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,679
that have been poached throughout the

661
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
years for medical medium they're hearing

662
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,480
different things it sounds good sounds

663
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,279
like it might work maybe if they're

664
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,720
lucky they'll get a poached tool that

665
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:01,440
does help but in the end they're still

666
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,960
in the dark and it's really sad

667
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,000
parasites aren't the problem they're not

668
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,840
the reason why people are suffering and

669
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,919
sick out there yes parasites are

670
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,600
dangerous but you now know how and why

671
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,159
check out the medical medium book series

672
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,559

you there's a big difference the

683
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,200
parasites that knock you so hard you

684
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,519
take a fall get up from the dinner table

685
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,960
you got some food

686
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,799
poisoning you're barfing in the toilet

687
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,639
all night long huge difference then

688
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,600
worms that creepy crawl

689
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:04,360
the worms that people get inside of them

690
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,840
that can live in synchronicity with

691
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:12,360
everyone all day long the tapeworm can

692
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:16,960
grow and grow and grow and get very

693
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:20,679
long but is easily spotted and killed so

694
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,840
the person can go back to their normal

695
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:28,320
lifelong a heartworm in your pet can be

696
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,799
stopped by a good vet there are are lots

697
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,320
of annoying worms but they're different

698
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,200
than chronic illness itself different

699
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,159
than so many people suffering with

700
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,399
different neurological symptoms

701
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,720
struggling so much they can't even move

702
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,799
through their day those are viruses and

703
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,840
pathogens bacteria that keep people in

704
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,320
that way and those stealth pathogens

705
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,039
aren't parasites the ones that knock

706
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,799
people down parasites old parasites that

707
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,399
keep people in their hospital beds

708
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,960
those parasites are so much different

709
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:06,639
they stay with you until you're dead

710
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,600
unless your body kills that parasite

711
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:12,159
kills that parasite you're free to live

712
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,519
another night the body's battle against

713
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,279
a parasite is much different than the

714
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,039
battle against stealth viruses and

715
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:22,159
bacteria different we can live with

716
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,919
stealth viruses in our body for the rest

717
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,519
of our life and worms are different than

718
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,360
parasites and stealth viruses they're

719
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,880
much different we can live with them our

720
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,679
whole life and not even have them cause

721
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
a

722
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,480
symptom yes some worms like a tapeworm

723
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,039
can get really big and hurt us but they

724
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,200
can be found really easily and killed

725
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,480
within us don't be fooled these are

726
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,840
three different things these are the

727
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:58,840
rules parasites worms and pathogens try

728
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,840
not to forget again

729
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,799
original published medical medium

730
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,279
information gets stolen and poached by

731
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,480
podcast doctors social media doctors

732
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:20,080
influencers and medical clinics medical

733
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,639
medium information has never yet been

734
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,799
proven Wrong by medical science and
