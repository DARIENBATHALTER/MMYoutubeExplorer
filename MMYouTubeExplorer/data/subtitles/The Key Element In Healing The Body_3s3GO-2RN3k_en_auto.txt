[0.12 - 4.64] medium we're live streaming right here
[2.20 - 7.20] going to talk about the B12 show a
[4.64 - 8.76] little bit the episode The B12 episode
[7.20 - 11.32] really important because I'm getting a
[8.76 - 14.64] lot of questions now coming in like do I
[11.32 - 17.16] need B12 are my B12 levels okay they're
[14.64 - 19.28] too high are they too low what does B12
[17.16 - 22.36] do how does it work in my body and I
[19.28 - 25.32] talk about it in the episode B12 trick
[22.36 - 27.08] or treat you don't get it from me I talk
[25.32 - 28.72] about it in that episode at Medical Me
[27.08 - 30.16] podcast at Apple podcast you want to
[28.72 - 31.84] check that episode out but I'm going to
[30.16 - 34.84] talk about neurological symptoms too
[31.84 - 37.16] because the B12 goes hand inand with
[34.84 - 39.00] neurological symptoms if you're battling
[37.16 - 41.68] something neurologically and you need
[39.00 - 44.24] help neurologically B12 is one of the
[41.68 - 46.96] key pieces that has to be involved and
[44.24 - 49.04] it has to be the right kind of B12 it
[46.96 - 51.00] can't be the wrong kind of B12 because
[49.04 - 52.40] the wrong kind of B12 is not going to
[51.00 - 54.52] get you improvements and then you'll be
[52.40 - 56.52] like oh I tried that or I did that I
[54.52 - 58.28] tried B12 and it didn't work and then
[56.52 - 60.36] you get cheated out of healing or
[58.28 - 62.56] cheated out of getting a chance to move
[60.36 - 65.08] forward and do some healing and all that
[62.56 - 66.88] guys great to see you so medical medum

[76.24 - 81.04] questions the B12 show just completely
[78.84 - 83.72] kicks something off with everybody it
[81.04 - 85.64] just it really kind of hit everybody in
[83.72 - 87.28] a way where kind of like the apple cider
[85.64 - 89.52] vinegar episode did you listen to the

[108.64 - 112.68] the teeth or not check that Apple set of
[110.76 - 114.84] vinegar episode that really triggered
[112.68 - 116.44] off the Torches and pitchforks and you

[122.12 - 126.52] whole point is that I want to talk about

[669.80 - 675.64] meditations uh Joshua Eldridge says I
[673.12 - 678.68] love the explanation of microorganisms
[675.64 - 681.52] it reminded me of a Marvel movie like
[678.68 - 683.76] Ant-Man that's incredible um you know
[681.52 - 687.40] people don't realize it that it's
[683.76 - 690.20] microorganisms in your elium in your gut
[687.40 - 692.40] in your elium and in that elium down
[690.20 - 694.36] here okay it's really important that
[692.40 - 696.24] these microorganisms get in there and we
[694.36 - 698.96] only get them in once in a while like if
[696.24 - 701.72] you had an apple off of a tree if you
[698.96 - 703.32] had um you know a cucumber out of
[701.72 - 705.92] somebody's Garden if you grew some
[703.32 - 708.04] parsley out of a pot or you know a pot
[705.92 - 710.44] you have like outside your little
[708.04 - 712.16] Terrace there or maybe you're just you
[710.44 - 713.96] know you're an apartment building and
[712.16 - 716.04] all you have is your kitchen with a
[713.96 - 718.52] little window and then you grow some
[716.04 - 720.16] Sprouts like in a sprout tray you guys
[718.52 - 723.48] and what happens is is these
[720.16 - 727.00] microorganisms they actually appear they
[723.48 - 728.80] do grow on all of this living produce
[727.00 - 731.40] that we that we can grow like a little
[728.80 - 733.44] garden with some kale growing out of it
[731.40 - 736.28] maybe you have that option once in your
[733.44 - 738.40] life it helps just to have it once and
[736.28 - 740.60] then these little microorganisms are on
[738.40 - 742.88] these plants and I talk about this at
[740.60 - 746.24] the medical Me podcast at Apple podcast
[742.88 - 748.08] the B12 episode you got to check it out
[746.24 - 750.04] cuz I really go into it in depth in
[748.08 - 751.96] there really and these microorganisms
[750.04 - 754.04] when you eat them they bypass the
[751.96 - 758.04] stomach they find their way to the ilum
[754.04 - 761.76] and then they start producing the
[758.04 - 763.88] co-enzyme but it's not quite 100% in its
[761.76 - 766.08] you know valuable form yet until it hits
[763.88 - 768.52] the liver and I talk all about it so
[766.08 - 771.28] important Lorraine L I'm looking forward
[768.52 - 773.28] to Full Moon next week next week
[771.28 - 776.04] planning to do the moon meditation every
[773.28 - 778.52] day I think I read a comment lorine that
[776.04 - 780.32] you said that you you prefer you prefer
[778.52 - 781.72] waiting for you did you've done the moon
[780.32 - 783.16] meditation but I think you said
[781.72 - 784.60] something like you were waiting for the
[783.16 - 786.84] full moon coming and that's why you were
[784.60 - 789.52] going to do it all over again so it's so
[786.84 - 791.40] great that you're doing that um so proud
[789.52 - 793.12] of you and people don't think I read the
[791.40 - 795.20] comments but I read the comments you
[793.12 - 796.76] know I just have uh I have so many
[795.20 - 798.16] things going on all at once while I'm
[796.76 - 800.28] trying to read them then it's hard for
[798.16 - 803.16] me to respond because I have so many
[800.28 - 805.32] things oh my God uh Karen love your
[803.16 - 806.88] podcast really our life changing and we
[805.32 - 809.44] should share it everywhere so more
[806.88 - 812.24] people can listen to you and heal thank
[809.44 - 814.20] you am honor Karen because sharing it's
[812.24 - 816.84] really important you guys tell people to

[819.16 - 823.32] at Apple podcast so you're subscribing
[820.72 - 824.84] to Medical medium podcast because what
[823.32 - 827.44] happens is when I come out with the next
[824.84 - 828.56] episode you want to know you want to be
[827.44 - 831.28] there when you want to get the
[828.56 - 833.08] notification that it's out now just just
[831.28 - 834.60] so you don't miss it and time doesn't go
[833.08 - 836.64] by and all this other stuff the link is
[834.60 - 840.16] in the description check it out the link
[836.64 - 842.12] is in the description um you guys so
[840.16 - 844.04] proud of all you're doing so I just want
[842.12 - 848.16] to go into this a little bit just
[844.04 - 850.52] because our B12 is high doesn't mean we
[848.16 - 853.88] are using it doesn't mean we're actually
[850.52 - 855.72] utilizing it assimilating absorbing it
[853.88 - 857.92] it could be in our bloodstream from the
[855.72 - 860.00] animal products that we're eating but
[857.92 - 862.32] yet it's not going into our nervous
[860.00 - 864.40] system and as the years go by we start
[862.32 - 865.80] getting some different symptoms you know
[864.40 - 867.72] for all kinds of problems that I talk
[865.80 - 870.08] about in the neurological episode so
[867.72 - 873.44] what I recommend okay if you guys have a
[870.08 - 875.32] chance what I recommend is listen to the
[873.44 - 878.12] B12 episode and listen to the
[875.32 - 880.44] neurological symptoms episode okay link
[878.12 - 882.60] is in the description B12 episode and
[880.44 - 885.44] neurological episode subscribe to the
[882.60 - 887.16] medical meme podcast too and the reason
[885.44 - 889.04] why it's important to listen to both of
[887.16 - 891.12] those is because B12 is critical for
[889.04 - 894.92] neurological symptoms and I talk about
[891.12 - 897.12] why and everything Alexandra Sophia said
[894.92 - 899.36] I did the moon meditation three times
[897.12 - 901.60] last night after experiencing emotion
[899.36 - 905.36] pain and the meditation completely
[901.60 - 907.76] calmed me and took pain to zero oh my
[905.36 - 910.36] God it's so important that's so
[907.76 - 913.80] important um you know it helps with
[910.36 - 915.88] anxiety it helps with depression it's um
[913.80 - 918.24] it really helps with all of it the the
[915.88 - 920.64] Moon meditation really helps with
[918.24 - 923.00] anxiety really helps check it out the
[920.64 - 924.92] moon meditation at Medical meeting

[924.92 - 929.44] description it helps with anxiety it
[927.28 - 931.44] helps with the Vagas nerve helps with
[929.44 - 934.16] our souls that it helps with our soul
[931.44 - 936.16] with emotional injuries betrayal have

[954.08 - 958.40] by the way um that's in the uh Moon
[956.84 - 961.36] meditation episode I think it's in that
[958.40 - 962.96] one you know I was shocked at how much
[961.36 - 964.64] you know the thing is I'm trying to read
[962.96 - 967.92] these comments they keep on flying up so
[964.64 - 969.72] fast so it's hard you guys you know it's
[967.92 - 973.72] it's the thing with the moon meditation
[969.72 - 976.28] is when our souls get injured by so much
[973.72 - 979.92] and I'm talking about broken trust
[976.28 - 982.68] betrayal broken relationships hardships
[979.92 - 984.68] losses all these different issues I got
[982.68 - 987.16] to tell you guys it's really painful but
[984.68 - 989.04] we carry these wounds with us and then
[987.16 - 991.08] we're afraid to trust and then then
[989.04 - 993.60] we're like well I can't trust I can't
[991.08 - 995.12] trust that person and I can't trust this
[993.60 - 997.00] person I don't know what to do I can't
[995.12 - 999.16] trust this decision I'm supposed to do
[997.00 - 1000.84] like where do I where do I go and you
[999.16 - 1003.76] know what happens is that we get to a
[1000.84 - 1006.20] place in our life where we just we just
[1003.76 - 1008.44] you know we just don't trust anymore and
[1006.20 - 1010.08] the wounds stick with us and I want you
[1008.44 - 1011.56] guys to be able to release that and be
[1010.08 - 1013.72] able to heal that I've used the

[1206.88 - 1211.20] what would I do if I had some
[1208.24 - 1213.08] neurological symptoms okay so if I had
[1211.20 - 1215.08] some ringing in the ears and some
[1213.08 - 1217.52] dizziness feeling of being on a boat
[1215.08 - 1219.92] aches and pains you know the anxiety the
[1217.52 - 1222.44] ticks and spasms and all the other
[1219.92 - 1224.48] different symptoms what I I would listen
[1222.44 - 1227.04] to the podcast that's what I would do
[1224.48 - 1229.56] learn about those neurological symptoms
[1227.04 - 1232.32] listen to the B12 one see I'm kind of
[1229.56 - 1235.84] giving you Direction you know like yeah
[1232.32 - 1238.32] B12 plays a role and it big role in how
[1235.84 - 1241.40] we get these neurological things under
[1238.32 - 1243.72] control so important so there's that the
[1241.40 - 1245.56] brain fog episode is another one you can
[1243.72 - 1247.56] learn about what brain fog is that's a
[1245.56 - 1250.48] neurological symptom by the way so
[1247.56 - 1252.36] that's important um Na says I'm loving
[1250.48 - 1255.12] the music and the podcast combined with
[1252.36 - 1258.84] your voice it's so powerful that's
[1255.12 - 1261.96] incredible I can't believe it um and so
[1258.84 - 1264.56] Carmen said coffee matcha tea has truths
[1261.96 - 1268.36] yeah totally that episode is really
[1264.56 - 1270.48] really incredible um you know I'll tell
[1268.36 - 1272.52] you I want you guys to have as much
[1270.48 - 1275.40] information as you possibly can I want
[1272.52 - 1277.76] you to heal these are not throw away
[1275.40 - 1279.36] that what when you hear the word podcast
[1277.76 - 1281.28] would what I always thought when I heard
[1279.36 - 1283.68] the word podcast in the past I always
[1281.28 - 1285.88] thought well because the old radio show
[1283.68 - 1288.72] I did was never a podcast you know you
[1285.88 - 1290.44] guys it was an old radio show and and
[1288.72 - 1292.12] then you know yeah you could hear it as
[1290.44 - 1294.48] a podcast but it wasn't a podcast this
[1292.12 - 1297.16] is the official medical meaning podcast
[1294.48 - 1298.80] right at Apple podcast and what I always
[1297.16 - 1300.40] heard about podcast was I always thought
[1298.80 - 1302.44] well throwaways you know it's just like
[1300.40 - 1304.56] get as many guests as you can have on
[1302.44 - 1307.88] talk a little bit about this and that
[1304.56 - 1309.64] ask a few quick questions next next next
[1307.88 - 1311.72] there's just like kind of like cotton
[1309.64 - 1313.20] candy and you get a tidbit here get a
[1311.72 - 1316.00] tidbit there but then there's all this
[1313.20 - 1317.48] confusion well that's what I've always
[1316.00 - 1318.68] thought about with podcast you know but
[1317.48 - 1321.60] there's some good ones out there but
[1318.68 - 1323.36] still but with this I said you know what
[1321.60 - 1327.52] don't want to do that I don't want to do
[1323.36 - 1330.00] that I want information packed line for
[1327.52 - 1331.48] line I want people healing more people
[1330.00 - 1333.84] healing just like they are with the
[1331.48 - 1335.80] cleanse of heal book I want people
[1333.84 - 1338.56] getting their lives back I want to make
[1335.80 - 1340.96] sure this has messages in it this has
[1338.56 - 1344.88] information in it that this is this is a
[1340.96 - 1348.24] docu series style this is not coffee

[1348.24 - 1354.92] you guys healing and that's what I want
[1351.20 - 1357.96] so important um yeah and so the bottom
[1354.92 - 1360.20] line is a B12 episode really important
[1357.96 - 1362.40] there think about central nervous system
[1360.20 - 1364.56] think about Vegas nerve think about an
[1362.40 - 1367.48] frenic nerves think about back like
[1364.56 - 1369.08] sciatic nerve okay tibial nerve all the
[1367.48 - 1372.48] different nerves it's so

[1430.64 - 1434.52] sure it's a guided meditation eventually
[1432.56 - 1436.56] for you guys I'll make that happen for
[1434.52 - 1438.96] you guys too because that would be a
[1436.56 - 1442.08] really powerful one for you guys
[1438.96 - 1445.24] um definitely it's a medical me book one
[1442.08 - 1447.64] um and anyway so kendice says how do you
[1445.24 - 1449.48] know how much B12 to take I really
[1447.64 - 1451.48] appreciate everything you're doing sir
[1449.48 - 1453.04] you're a true savior Kenneth I'm really
[1451.48 - 1456.20] glad you're here thank you for being
[1453.04 - 1458.36] here so awesome to see you and um how do
[1456.20 - 1461.40] you know how much B12 to take well it
[1458.36 - 1463.96] works like this it's really tricky where
[1461.40 - 1465.56] I put dosages all in cleanse the heel so
[1463.96 - 1466.92] I do put dosages for all kinds of
[1465.56 - 1468.52] different conditions in cleanse the heel
[1466.92 - 1469.92] so people have an idea and they could
[1468.52 - 1471.88] always do less they could talk to their
[1469.92 - 1474.12] doctor they could do more whatever they
[1471.88 - 1476.00] want to do but is but I always look at
[1474.12 - 1477.88] it this way if you don't have any going
[1476.00 - 1479.20] in you that's not going to help the
[1477.88 - 1480.96] situation especially if you have
[1479.20 - 1483.16] neurological symptoms or anything like
[1480.96 - 1485.36] that so it's important to get enough in
[1483.16 - 1488.60] you at the same time we burn through it
[1485.36 - 1491.44] we burn through B12 we utilize it so
[1488.60 - 1493.20] quickly are you under stress is anything
[1491.44 - 1495.16] happening in your life did you have a
[1493.20 - 1497.52] hardship did you were you under a lot of
[1495.16 - 1499.08] pressure on something emotional struggle
[1497.52 - 1501.60] did something happen
[1499.08 - 1504.12] any of that are you working hard are are
[1501.60 - 1506.52] you getting enough sleep and are are you
[1504.12 - 1508.00] dealing with symptoms and conditions so
[1506.52 - 1509.60] and if you're dealing with symptoms and
[1508.00 - 1511.96] conditions then it's always good to take
[1509.60 - 1514.80] more of it what do I do I mean if I had
[1511.96 - 1517.24] a B12 in front of me right now I'd show
[1514.80 - 1518.96] you right here but what I do is I take
[1517.24 - 1522.48] myself personally is I'll take like two
[1518.96 - 1524.24] dropper FS here two dropper FS there
[1522.48 - 1525.64] depending on what's Happening and lately
[1524.24 - 1527.44] I've been taking more I've been taking

[1529.52 - 1533.52] day I've been doing like four to six for
