[0.16 - 5.68] I recognized the medical medium. I had
[2.88 - 7.12] read like a little blog about him and
[5.68 - 9.36] yeah, just like a little seed was
[7.12 - 10.96] planted. I started listening and then a
[9.36 - 13.60] couple years later is when I started
[10.96 - 15.44] using his tools because I got desperate
[13.60 - 18.32] with my symptoms. I struggled with
[15.44 - 20.96] chronic UTI for about 20 years and I was
[18.32 - 22.96] on antibiotics every month, sometimes
[20.96 - 25.28] every week. I probably took hundreds of
[22.96 - 27.76] rounds of antibiotics throughout those
[25.28 - 29.28] 15 to 20 years. And it wasn't until I
[27.76 - 32.08] found his information that I was able to
[29.28 - 34.56] clear those on my own. And I've been UTI
[32.08 - 37.04] free for probably three or four years
[34.56 - 38.64] and antibiotic free for 5 years. But I
[37.04 - 41.60] just wanted to meet Anthony and thank
[38.64 - 44.60] him for just giving me a new life
[41.60 - 44.60] really.
