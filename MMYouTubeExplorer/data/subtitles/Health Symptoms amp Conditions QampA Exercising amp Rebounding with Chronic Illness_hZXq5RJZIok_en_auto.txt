[0.18 - 5.28] first month anniversary on Tick Tock
[3.06 - 9.12] since I've been a dietitian
[5.28 - 12.60] uh-huh you know I do it Rd here
[9.12 - 14.88] you saw that I know
[12.60 - 17.28] I know thank you for paying for my
[14.88 - 20.22] registered dietitian School you and
[17.28 - 22.86] Daddy have been really so helpful
[20.22 - 24.96] I know my Tick Tock page is growing I
[22.86 - 26.52] talk about protein
[24.96 - 29.76] uh-huh
[26.52 - 31.86] yeah I know Mommy I know Mom I know
[29.76 - 34.92] protein is like the most important thing
[31.86 - 36.60] ever it's why I became a dietitian
[34.92 - 38.04] uh-huh
[36.60 - 40.50] yeah
[38.04 - 44.42] okay I have to go to work I think I'm
[40.50 - 44.42] going live on Tick Tock right now
[44.46 - 47.64] okay bye
[46.14 - 50.94] love you
[47.64 - 53.76] okay so as I was saying before
[50.94 - 56.70] this has protein in it and this is this
[53.76 - 60.12] is meat and it has protein in it are
[56.70 - 62.40] these here I have to say that Rd here
[60.12 - 64.08] because it's really important when I
[62.40 - 66.72] graduated from registered dietitian
[64.08 - 67.62] school they gave us all this for our
[66.72 - 70.80] class
[67.62 - 73.02] and they said that you have to learn how
[70.80 - 75.24] to identify when someone's protein
[73.02 - 77.16] deficient or they're not protein
[75.24 - 81.36] deficient and you can do that by looking
[77.16 - 82.44] at this scientific measuring tool that
[81.36 - 86.10] they gave us
[82.44 - 88.74] at dietitian school and they got like
[86.10 - 92.94] I think my dietitian stuff is really
[88.74 - 94.86] paying off on tick tock and I okay
[92.94 - 96.78] come down
[94.86 - 99.00] Okay so
[96.78 - 101.82] this is a measuring tool to show how
[99.00 - 104.22] much protein one is getting and and
[101.82 - 107.64] dietitian School were taught that it all
[104.22 - 108.56] depends like your facial structure and
[107.64 - 111.36] everything
[108.56 - 112.74] determines how much protein you actually
[111.36 - 115.74] receive
[112.74 - 117.60] and how much B12
[115.74 - 119.94] I can't believe how much I learned about
[117.60 - 122.28] B12 and registered dietitian school they
[119.94 - 125.04] said that only the meat eaters can have
[122.28 - 126.96] B12 and get B12
[125.04 - 129.00] B12
[126.96 - 129.66] okay
[129.00 - 131.70] um
[129.66 - 133.92] this is really important that I want
[131.70 - 135.42] everybody to know on my Tick Tock page I
[133.92 - 136.92] can't wait to make small videos out of
[135.42 - 140.34] this on my Tick Tock page
[136.92 - 142.68] oh my God like cheese
[140.34 - 145.26] I want you to know that it's so
[142.68 - 148.56] important it's a staple that every girl
[145.26 - 151.44] should be on yes
[148.56 - 154.62] um how old am I I just saw a comment I'm
[151.44 - 157.08] 24 years old and yes I just graduated
[154.62 - 159.48] from registered dietitian school I want
[157.08 - 163.08] to go into how cheese is so important I
[159.48 - 167.66] have I have four ounces of cheese per
[163.08 - 169.86] day and in The dietitian handbook guide
[167.66 - 172.68] where is it
[169.86 - 173.94] I've been doing this now for I guess a
[172.68 - 176.88] couple of months I just graduate
[173.94 - 180.60] graduate Grant I think
[176.88 - 183.06] I have my handbook guide right here that
[180.60 - 186.42] they gave us at The dietitian School
[183.06 - 188.82] Rd here I know right
[186.42 - 191.94] and they say that cheese is
[188.82 - 194.70] fundamentally one of the most important
[191.94 - 197.22] things that you can actually get in you
[194.70 - 200.04] exactly a whole bunch of us graduated
[197.22 - 202.44] and we're killing it on Tick Tock now
[200.04 - 204.42] so cheese is probably one of the better
[202.44 - 205.44] things sorry I got a phone call coming
[204.42 - 207.06] in
[205.44 - 208.74] you see
[207.06 - 210.12] hold on
[208.74 - 214.98] hi
[210.12 - 216.54] yeah now I I know I'm in alive I know
[214.98 - 218.04] Todd
[216.54 - 220.68] Todd
[218.04 - 223.56] I know I thank you for being so
[220.68 - 225.06] supportive okay I'll see you later okay
[223.56 - 226.74] that's just my boyfriend just don't
[225.06 - 229.50] worry
[226.74 - 231.90] his family had celiac
[229.50 - 234.00] and they're all like Celiac people his
[231.90 - 237.36] whole family his mother has Celiac is
[234.00 - 239.82] Dad has Celiac and he says he has Celiac
[237.36 - 242.16] and I told him that you have to get as
[239.82 - 246.18] many eggs in you as possible and as much
[242.16 - 248.28] cheese and he's on an 100 egg diet an
[246.18 - 250.08] egg white diet right now and so I've
[248.28 - 253.38] been really helping my boyfriend and his
[250.08 - 255.06] family with their Celiac now I what I
[253.38 - 258.18] really like is chicken
[255.06 - 260.94] I eat chicken three times a day every
[258.18 - 262.50] day for the protein chicken's the most
[260.94 - 263.46] important and I just want to say one
[262.50 - 266.10] more thing
[263.46 - 268.02] that's really really important is that I
[266.10 - 271.02] don't want anyone to think that they
[268.02 - 272.70] can't indulge because I've noticed that
[271.02 - 275.34] there's Eating Disorders out there being
[272.70 - 277.80] started by people who have like they
[275.34 - 281.16] think they've run the gamut in social
[277.80 - 283.38] media and they actually they actually
[281.16 - 285.72] like tell people to stay away from so
[283.38 - 287.64] many things but you have to treat
[285.72 - 291.96] yourself because it's called moderation
[287.64 - 295.26] and balance and so what I recommend is
[291.96 - 298.20] some chocolate cake once in a while or
[295.26 - 300.24] you have an eating disorder and so I'm
[298.20 - 302.10] just telling you I learned a lot from my
[300.24 - 304.56] dietitian school and I have a lot of
[302.10 - 306.30] experience too because you know when I
[304.56 - 308.58] put in my resume now that I've been
[306.30 - 311.16] doing this since I was like 11 years old
[308.58 - 314.34] I was telling my mom what she should eat
[311.16 - 316.74] or not eat I have so much experience and
[314.34 - 318.66] what I did was on my website now in my
[316.74 - 321.42] Tick Tock handle I talk about how I've
[318.66 - 323.76] been doing this for like 10 years
[321.42 - 326.34] even though I'm 24 years old I've been
[323.76 - 328.86] doing this for 10 years and I'm so
[326.34 - 330.42] accomplished and I went to school and
[328.86 - 333.18] dietitian school I just want to show you
[330.42 - 336.36] what happens with this tool here this is
[333.18 - 340.62] a tool you when you graduate they give
[336.36 - 342.84] every single Rd there this very tool it
[340.62 - 346.26] determines how much protein how many
[342.84 - 348.24] carbs if you have too many carbs it
[346.26 - 351.84] changes the structure of your face if
[348.24 - 354.48] you have two not enough protein it
[351.84 - 356.52] changes the structure of your face and
[354.48 - 357.72] you can get really sick and protein
[356.52 - 360.48] deficient
[357.72 - 365.10] I think that's it for this
[360.48 - 368.04] episode of Samantha Samantha's Rd
[365.10 - 369.36] channel on Tick Tock
[368.04 - 372.06] um there's so many of us out there
[369.36 - 375.30] fighting for people and getting benefits
[372.06 - 377.34] to them I think um anyway thank you so
[375.30 - 383.12] much I have to take a phone call now I'm
[377.34 - 383.12] so busy I'm a busy Rd and I have to go
[414.84 - 417.02] foreign
[430.68 - 434.94] anyway we're talking about neurological
[432.72 - 438.72] symptoms today you guys we're going to
[434.94 - 441.18] cover tingles numbness aches pains
[438.72 - 443.40] different kind of neuro symptoms even
[441.18 - 446.04] touch upon migraines neurological
[443.40 - 447.80] migraines we're going to touch upon a
[446.04 - 452.16] lot of the different Tremors shakes
[447.80 - 453.90] ticks spasms cranial nerves which is
[452.16 - 455.64] really important too you got cranial
[453.90 - 458.04] nerves that really affect everybody in
[455.64 - 460.02] so many ways try geminal neuralgia
[458.04 - 461.46] all kinds of different problems people
[460.02 - 463.92] are up against
[461.46 - 466.08] and so I think it's really smart to
[463.92 - 468.18] touch upon neurological symptoms I want
[466.08 - 470.04] to do a little q a stuff too so I want
[468.18 - 472.80] to be open to that as well
[470.04 - 474.78] and so I want to begin with is what
[472.80 - 476.40] happens is that
[474.78 - 478.80] practitioners
[476.40 - 479.78] and doctors people in the health
[478.80 - 483.84] movement
[479.78 - 486.96] never ever connected the dots between a
[483.84 - 488.64] symptom being neurological if you're
[486.96 - 490.62] somebody that's experienced enough in
[488.64 - 492.60] the last 10 years 15 years maybe you've
[490.62 - 494.04] been sick 20 years in your life
[492.60 - 496.20] and you've been sick with different
[494.04 - 498.26] neurological symptoms you probably went
[496.20 - 500.34] through the whole guessing games Channel
[498.26 - 501.72] seeing a lot of different professionals
[500.34 - 504.30] and health professionals a lot of
[501.72 - 506.70] different doctors and as it's happening
[504.30 - 509.58] none of them knew that your symptom was
[506.70 - 512.34] actually neurological not even believe
[509.58 - 515.94] it or not like panic attacks back then
[512.34 - 518.46] 10 years ago or more a panic attack was
[515.94 - 520.62] never considered to be neuro or
[518.46 - 523.02] Neurological on any level and this is
[520.62 - 525.06] important to know because now that the
[523.02 - 527.28] time is changing things are changing now
[525.06 - 528.90] and what's happening is people are
[527.28 - 531.48] realizing through medical medium books
[528.90 - 533.70] and medical meme information because it
[531.48 - 537.02] was being put out there through these
[533.70 - 539.70] books about how neurological symptoms
[537.02 - 541.14] like give you all of these different
[539.70 - 543.72] things like we feel these different
[541.14 - 547.32] things from cranial symptoms cranial
[543.72 - 548.58] nerves to vagus nerves to all kinds of
[547.32 - 550.32] different things so I want to cover that
[548.58 - 553.08] right now a little q a how many people
[550.32 - 555.24] go through tightness of the chest
[553.08 - 557.70] and it's unexplainable they have this
[555.24 - 560.28] tightness of the chest going on kindness
[557.70 - 561.78] of the throat kindness of the chest how
[560.28 - 563.58] many people have ever gone through that
[561.78 - 565.50] they feel like they can't get a deep
[563.58 - 567.78] breath and they're having a problem
[565.50 - 570.00] getting a deep breath right so that's
[567.78 - 573.00] actually Vegas nerve related stuff if
[570.00 - 574.62] your doctor rules out everything that
[573.00 - 576.24] they are looking for if they're looking
[574.62 - 577.92] for something and they rule it out and
[576.24 - 580.92] they're like look you got anxiety let's
[577.92 - 584.40] put you on some benzos let's send you
[580.92 - 587.16] home with a benzo you can take an Ativan
[584.40 - 588.78] a Xanax whatever it is and they send you
[587.16 - 591.36] home with that and they're like do this
[588.78 - 594.00] for a while see how your anxiety gets
[591.36 - 595.86] see how your Panic gets see how your
[594.00 - 597.84] tightness of your chest is in the whole
[595.86 - 599.64] bit right and they rule out pretty much
[597.84 - 600.96] everything else they do blood work they
[599.64 - 602.48] look at you but they can't release
[600.96 - 604.80] everybody's saying yes right there
[602.48 - 607.02] exactly that's what you have lately too
[604.80 - 610.98] I'm seeing all that
[607.02 - 614.06] so what is missed in the health world
[610.98 - 614.06] it's a big deal
[614.88 - 619.74] vagus nerve issues now you'll hear more
[617.10 - 622.08] about vagus nerve issues now a day right
[619.74 - 624.72] you'll hear more about it but what
[622.08 - 627.54] people don't realize is why do we get
[624.72 - 631.70] symptoms that are vagus nerve related
[627.54 - 634.38] why and how how does it even happen so
[631.70 - 637.50] what medical mean information brought
[634.38 - 641.10] into town years ago was that nerves
[637.50 - 643.20] swell nerves actually swell they become
[641.10 - 646.80] inflamed there's a reason why they
[643.20 - 648.66] become mysteriously inflamed when you
[646.80 - 651.96] haven't had an accident or an actual
[648.66 - 654.14] physical injury or anything like that
[651.96 - 658.44] there's a reason why nerves get
[654.14 - 663.06] mysteriously inflamed and that's viruses
[658.44 - 665.16] viruses such as Epstein-Barr being one
[663.06 - 667.04] of the leaders everybody's got
[665.16 - 669.92] Epstein-Barr at this point in the world
[667.04 - 672.36] spreading fast but it's not just about
[669.92 - 674.52] everybody's got Epstein-Barr you know
[672.36 - 677.40] everybody's got Epstein-Barr 80 in just
[674.52 - 679.92] about that it's everybody's getting more
[677.40 - 681.96] than one variety of Epstein-Barr and
[679.92 - 683.76] that's what's happening out there so
[681.96 - 685.26] it's like there isn't just one
[683.76 - 688.08] Epstein-Barr that means if you have
[685.26 - 691.14] Epstein-Barr you can't get Epstein-Barr
[688.08 - 693.02] again that's not true you can have one
[691.14 - 695.18] Epstein-Barr and get another
[693.02 - 697.80] Epstein-Barr and get another
[695.18 - 701.58] Epstein-Barr and get another and another
[697.80 - 702.90] and another all different varieties some
[701.58 - 705.78] Milder
[702.90 - 707.76] some more annoying some more aggressive
[705.78 - 711.18] but you can get a lot of different
[707.76 - 714.54] varieties of these viruses and these
[711.18 - 717.48] viruses release something I call a
[714.54 - 720.54] neurotoxin it's when the virus eats
[717.48 - 722.58] something it really likes
[720.54 - 726.92] like an egg
[722.58 - 730.02] and then peas and poos
[726.92 - 732.90] waste out of the virus
[730.02 - 735.96] that floats around your body and is
[732.90 - 736.98] highly highly allergenic to the vagus
[735.96 - 738.42] nerves
[736.98 - 740.34] right there
[738.42 - 742.80] one of the most important things you can
[740.34 - 746.34] learn to empower yourself
[742.80 - 747.72] is vagus nerves swelling getting
[746.34 - 751.20] inflamed
[747.72 - 754.62] because there's something toxic a
[751.20 - 756.30] neurotoxic compound that's saturating
[754.62 - 759.00] the nerve
[756.30 - 760.92] that's touching the nerves creating them
[759.00 - 765.12] to spasm
[760.92 - 768.90] creating them to twist a little creating
[765.12 - 770.52] them to swell and get more inflamed and
[768.90 - 772.32] this leads
[770.52 - 773.88] to a lot of different symptoms and
[772.32 - 778.14] conditions people are suffering with
[773.88 - 781.98] okay from intestinal tract pain
[778.14 - 785.10] stomach problems intestinal tract pain
[781.98 - 788.40] okay that alone because the vagus nerves
[785.10 - 791.70] are inflamed to tremors
[788.40 - 794.76] to spasms and ticks
[791.70 - 796.50] to tingles and numbness on the body
[794.76 - 798.78] and not just the Vegas there was getting
[796.50 - 801.78] inflamed but the phrenic nerves that run
[798.78 - 804.24] down each side of the chest here
[801.78 - 806.22] the the phrenic nerves can get inflamed
[804.24 - 808.08] and swell too which give people a lot of
[806.22 - 809.70] different issues as well both the
[808.08 - 811.44] phrenic nerves and vagus nerves can
[809.70 - 814.98] inflame Korean tightness of the chest
[811.44 - 817.62] that's unexplainable by any physician or
[814.98 - 819.90] any doctor out there mystery symptoms
[817.62 - 822.18] that are plaguing people out there all
[819.90 - 826.02] the time
[822.18 - 827.40] and so what is critical to know is that
[826.02 - 829.50] people walk around with lots of
[827.40 - 831.96] different bugs in them different viruses
[829.50 - 834.12] now the thing is here is that the health
[831.96 - 836.28] movement years ago you could even hear a
[834.12 - 838.80] word like nobody even knew virus what do
[836.28 - 841.20] you mean what does that even mean no one
[838.80 - 843.18] talked about it didn't exist
[841.20 - 844.92] in the Natural Health move it it was
[843.18 - 847.38] just about eat better stuff eat better
[844.92 - 849.72] books eat better this it was about how
[847.38 - 853.14] wheat was genetically altered
[849.72 - 854.82] that wheat was hybridized that wheat has
[853.14 - 857.34] changed in this world that was pretty
[854.82 - 860.04] much all you can actually get back years
[857.34 - 862.50] just more a little over 10 years ago was
[860.04 - 866.70] just wheat's genetically altered Wheats
[862.50 - 870.12] hybridized wheat's causing our problems
[866.70 - 872.04] gluten is causing our problems no no
[870.12 - 873.66] information on how gluten is causing our
[872.04 - 875.28] problems on any level
[873.66 - 877.14] but that's what you would get you would
[875.28 - 878.58] get eat better books to stay away from
[877.14 - 881.82] processed foods
[878.58 - 883.44] to stay away from fried greasy foods and
[881.82 - 886.20] that's what was given to us pretty much
[883.44 - 888.60] all around that's all you can do it's
[886.20 - 891.42] like years ago you got sick
[888.60 - 893.46] it was like well maybe it was that fast
[891.42 - 895.32] food diet doing it maybe it's just
[893.46 - 896.22] hybridized wheat I've been eating every
[895.32 - 897.78] day
[896.22 - 899.82] in this gluten
[897.78 - 902.52] but that's pretty much as far as it went
[899.82 - 905.28] and then you had millions of people on
[902.52 - 907.08] the planet suffering with all kinds of
[905.28 - 908.76] symptoms conditions including thyroid
[907.08 - 910.44] conditions many of you guys got thyroid
[908.76 - 913.92] problems right doctors checking out your
[910.44 - 916.44] thyroid your numbers don't look good
[913.92 - 918.54] and they're like Hashimoto's all of it
[916.44 - 921.30] and then there's the mystery symptoms
[918.54 - 923.82] the fatigue so I want to go into that a
[921.30 - 927.24] little bit too when someone has a viral
[923.82 - 929.94] load and that viral load is feeding on
[927.24 - 931.62] what it wants like say eggs and cheese
[929.94 - 933.84] and dairy I'm just showing you a little
[931.62 - 937.02] bit here in that viral load
[933.84 - 939.90] is getting high because
[937.02 - 943.26] a virus is feeding off of eggs
[939.90 - 944.94] and devouring the eggs
[943.26 - 947.18] and then releasing neurotoxins
[944.94 - 951.18] neurotoxins are flooding the entire body
[947.18 - 953.10] and then the vagus nerves swell up
[951.18 - 955.92] and now we're in fatigue where we feel
[953.10 - 958.86] like we have sandbags for arms we feel
[955.92 - 961.08] like we have sandbags for legs we have a
[958.86 - 963.56] hard time getting out of bed we have
[961.08 - 966.06] what medical mean information States as
[963.56 - 968.10] neurological fatigue
[966.06 - 969.78] so I know that so many of you guys have
[968.10 - 972.12] dealt with neurological fatigue out
[969.78 - 974.34] there where it doesn't make sense why
[972.12 - 976.14] are you tired someone will be like
[974.34 - 977.82] you're lazy and back years ago it was
[976.14 - 980.88] like you're lazy
[977.82 - 983.04] you're you're bored you just want to be
[980.88 - 984.24] on the couch you don't want to get out
[983.04 - 986.58] of bed
[984.24 - 988.74] you're just this is just who you are and
[986.58 - 991.56] people took the hit every day day in and
[988.74 - 994.02] day out for their neurological fatigue
[991.56 - 995.76] but what's really happening is you got
[994.02 - 999.24] the viral infections the viral
[995.76 - 1001.40] infections are releasing all of these
[999.24 - 1003.92] different neurotoxins including some
[1001.40 - 1005.48] neurotoxins the neurotoxins are landing
[1003.92 - 1008.48] on the nerves
[1005.48 - 1009.50] in the body and when they land on the
[1008.48 - 1013.52] nerves
[1009.50 - 1015.92] they swell and inflame the nerve very
[1013.52 - 1018.26] important to know because if you don't
[1015.92 - 1020.78] have answers you're lost you're in the
[1018.26 - 1023.06] dark you're searching the web
[1020.78 - 1024.74] you're checking through social and
[1023.06 - 1027.32] you're trying this and trying that and
[1024.74 - 1029.54] doing this and doing that when the
[1027.32 - 1031.16] answers aren't even clear to why you're
[1029.54 - 1032.00] even struggling or suffering on any
[1031.16 - 1033.68] level
[1032.00 - 1035.36] so I want to get into the brain a little
[1033.68 - 1037.76] bit the brain stem
[1035.36 - 1038.90] the vagus nerves come out of your brain
[1037.76 - 1041.30] stem
[1038.90 - 1043.88] so do other nerves too like trigeminal
[1041.30 - 1046.94] nerves many people you guys might be
[1043.88 - 1051.44] dealing with this is nerve problems in
[1046.94 - 1052.70] the neck in the jaw in the face facial
[1051.44 - 1054.62] nerves
[1052.70 - 1057.26] nerves
[1054.62 - 1059.24] right around the temple
[1057.26 - 1061.64] nerves around the eyes
[1059.24 - 1063.20] nerves in the back of the neck back of
[1061.64 - 1065.12] the head
[1063.20 - 1067.06] so you're dealing with cranial nerves
[1065.12 - 1069.98] facial nerves that are inflamed
[1067.06 - 1072.08] trigeminal nerves that are inflamed all
[1069.98 - 1073.70] from different viruses and viral
[1072.08 - 1075.56] infections so I want to get into that a
[1073.70 - 1077.00] little deeper we'll leave Epstein-Barr
[1075.56 - 1079.76] for the moment we'll pop back into it
[1077.00 - 1081.62] let's head into the shingles virus
[1079.76 - 1084.62] the shingles virus
[1081.62 - 1085.88] is growing fast out there more and more
[1084.62 - 1088.22] people are getting different varieties
[1085.88 - 1089.90] of shingles they're wreaking havoc and
[1088.22 - 1092.36] one of the things the shingles virus
[1089.90 - 1095.00] does is create trigeminal neuralgia
[1092.36 - 1097.04] facial nerve problems and different
[1095.00 - 1099.56] symptoms people get where your teeth
[1097.04 - 1102.20] hurt really bad your teeth hurt really
[1099.56 - 1103.88] bad your jaw hurts really bad you're
[1102.20 - 1106.22] going to the dentist over and over again
[1103.88 - 1108.38] you can't really get answers they're
[1106.22 - 1110.18] drilling your teeth they're doing root
[1108.38 - 1112.16] canals or maybe they're just pulling
[1110.18 - 1114.32] teeth because it gets so bad you're on
[1112.16 - 1115.82] medications you're struggling you're on
[1114.32 - 1117.44] gabapentin
[1115.82 - 1120.02] because that's what they put everybody
[1117.44 - 1121.94] on when you have jaw pain neck pain and
[1120.02 - 1125.42] it's unexplainable and you're struggling
[1121.94 - 1128.06] so much they throw you on gabapentin
[1125.42 - 1129.98] right so many people have been on that
[1128.06 - 1131.66] and I'm not saying don't be on it or be
[1129.98 - 1132.98] on it and just do what your doctor you
[1131.66 - 1135.20] know what's right by you and your doctor
[1132.98 - 1137.18] of course your doctor's guidance
[1135.20 - 1141.26] but so many people are giving so many
[1137.18 - 1142.70] medications like gabapentin and benzos
[1141.26 - 1144.14] to try to help them with the
[1142.70 - 1146.78] neurological pain
[1144.14 - 1149.30] and their neurological symptoms but yet
[1146.78 - 1151.70] the answers aren't there
[1149.30 - 1152.84] the answers are not there the well is
[1151.70 - 1155.00] dry
[1152.84 - 1156.20] and it's we're we're not getting an
[1155.00 - 1159.14] answer and so people have to understand
[1156.20 - 1162.32] something shingles can rash out
[1159.14 - 1165.98] and shingles can also not rash out
[1162.32 - 1169.70] you can have two just separate accounts
[1165.98 - 1171.20] of shingles one can rash out and they
[1169.70 - 1175.10] see push tools and then you have the
[1171.20 - 1177.98] nerve pain another never shows its face
[1175.10 - 1180.74] never Peaks its ugly head
[1177.98 - 1183.08] it just stays there on the nerves and
[1180.74 - 1186.26] you're walking around looking to try to
[1183.08 - 1189.08] get botox injections both Botox
[1186.26 - 1192.32] injections in your neck in the side of
[1189.08 - 1195.74] your neck right and the nerves near your
[1192.32 - 1198.02] brain stem nerves in your spine the
[1195.74 - 1200.12] nerves in your neck like you name it and
[1198.02 - 1202.16] people have to go and they have to seek
[1200.12 - 1204.26] this and look for this Botox in their
[1202.16 - 1206.96] facial nerves because they're in that
[1204.26 - 1208.64] much Agony and that much pain and
[1206.96 - 1210.56] they're walking around but what they
[1208.64 - 1214.22] don't get are answers to What's
[1210.56 - 1216.14] happening and how it's happening so
[1214.22 - 1217.52] in the medical medium book I don't know
[1216.14 - 1219.80] if you guys have the medical medium
[1217.52 - 1222.20] books on here many of you guys do right
[1219.80 - 1225.50] but that's cleanse the heel this is
[1222.20 - 1228.50] brain saver okay they're on sale at
[1225.50 - 1230.42] Amazon right now these books are

[1230.42 - 1235.64] turning people's lives around it'd be
[1232.70 - 1239.30] one thing if I said that when it did not
[1235.64 - 1241.22] happen but it did there are hundreds of
[1239.30 - 1242.90] thousands of people going into the
[1241.22 - 1245.06] millions just on brain saver alone
[1242.90 - 1247.28] around the world getting answers and
[1245.06 - 1250.70] cleanse the heel is one of the most
[1247.28 - 1252.44] famous books in health worldwide right
[1250.70 - 1254.36] now because of what it's done for people

[1260.30 - 1264.56] that you can look into to actually get
[1262.88 - 1265.64] some help with so let's cut into this a
[1264.56 - 1267.32] little bit more I want to talk about the
[1265.64 - 1268.34] shingles virus here's a question right
[1267.32 - 1270.92] here
[1268.34 - 1272.84] Nanny news right there on IG no more

[1285.20 - 1289.94] gone think about the power of that and
[1287.54 - 1292.58] how incredible that is right there The

[1295.16 - 1300.92] nothing makes me happier than to hear
[1298.16 - 1304.76] that because chronic constipation is not
[1300.92 - 1307.46] a joke it is brutal it really really can

[1348.86 - 1353.06] thankful so you guys
[1351.32 - 1354.68] I want to cut a little bit more deeper
[1353.06 - 1356.84] into the soul a lot of people have the
[1354.68 - 1359.36] shingles virus wreaking havoc creating
[1356.84 - 1361.34] inflammation in their trigeminal nerves
[1359.36 - 1366.14] and their facial nerves
[1361.34 - 1368.42] causing untold amounts of pain and
[1366.14 - 1371.00] sorrow for people they have to be on
[1368.42 - 1373.34] gabapentin they have to be on benzos
[1371.00 - 1376.52] they got to be on Xanax they got to be
[1373.34 - 1378.32] on antidepressants doctors recommend a
[1376.52 - 1381.08] cocktail of like antidepressants plus
[1378.32 - 1382.82] Gabapentin plus this plus that I'm not
[1381.08 - 1384.92] saying take those no I'm not saying
[1382.82 - 1386.42] don't take those I'm saying listen to
[1384.92 - 1388.82] your doctor whatever your doctor does
[1386.42 - 1391.04] for you and whatever guidance you want
[1388.82 - 1393.68] by your doctor I'm just saying the
[1391.04 - 1396.02] reality of The Facts of what people are
[1393.68 - 1399.74] on and what they go through and how
[1396.02 - 1401.24] difficult it is and that's not even the
[1399.74 - 1403.52] amount of people that are actually going
[1401.24 - 1405.20] and looking around for answers and
[1403.52 - 1407.36] they're trying this like they'll go and
[1405.20 - 1409.52] try ionized water like alkaline ionized
[1407.36 - 1411.80] water that stuff just makes things worse
[1409.52 - 1414.56] because of the metal plates leech metal
[1411.80 - 1417.62] I tell people stay
[1414.56 - 1419.96] a million years
[1417.62 - 1423.02] I would never touch in a natural water
[1419.96 - 1424.70] machine and a million freaking years I
[1423.02 - 1426.62] would never let that stuff poison me and
[1424.70 - 1429.20] poison my brain leeching off those metal
[1426.62 - 1431.24] plates at a million freaking years never
[1429.20 - 1432.38] and so I'm saying that people are then
[1431.24 - 1433.64] searching for answers and they're
[1432.38 - 1435.32] looking for all these different things
[1433.64 - 1437.24] if you're trying that they're trying
[1435.32 - 1439.70] this meanwhile they're suffering they're
[1437.24 - 1443.30] struggling it's really hard and they
[1439.70 - 1445.58] don't have answers so I want to go a
[1443.30 - 1447.32] little deeper now
[1445.58 - 1449.06] there are people out there suffering
[1447.32 - 1451.64] from so many different low-grade viral
[1449.06 - 1452.90] viruses and viral infections that
[1451.64 - 1455.18] they're dealing with a combination of
[1452.90 - 1456.56] different varieties
[1455.18 - 1458.54] and
[1456.56 - 1460.64] some varieties are the Epstein Barr some
[1458.54 - 1462.98] of the shingles some are hhv6 some are
[1460.64 - 1465.02] simplex one some are six plus Simplex 2
[1462.98 - 1467.24] and they're dealing with multiple
[1465.02 - 1469.16] problems in multiple viruses
[1467.24 - 1471.50] they'll have an Epstein-Barr and a
[1469.16 - 1473.06] shingles they'll have an Epstein-Barr
[1471.50 - 1476.24] and they'll have set of megalovirus
[1473.06 - 1479.90] they'll have that plus they'll have
[1476.24 - 1481.94] something like strep and that strip
[1479.90 - 1483.62] will work along with the Epstein-Barr
[1481.94 - 1485.48] virus so they'll have a combination of a
[1483.62 - 1486.92] few different things bacteria plus
[1485.48 - 1488.78] viruses
[1486.92 - 1490.40] and then these things are what gives
[1488.78 - 1492.50] people all these different crazy
[1490.40 - 1493.76] neurological symptoms as they live their
[1492.50 - 1495.20] life
[1493.76 - 1497.54] so they wake up in the morning and their
[1495.20 - 1498.74] problems not gone it's still there and
[1497.54 - 1501.32] then the next day they wake up in the
[1498.74 - 1502.88] morning they still have ticks and spasms
[1501.32 - 1504.38] they still have aches and pains they
[1502.88 - 1506.36] still have fatigue
[1504.38 - 1508.40] because until you get the answers to why
[1506.36 - 1509.84] these nerves are inflamed and learn that
[1508.40 - 1511.94] these nerves are inflamed from these
[1509.84 - 1514.76] viral infections can you actually
[1511.94 - 1516.32] address them and do something about it
[1514.76 - 1518.12] and so
[1516.32 - 1520.16] it's important to know the medical
[1518.12 - 1523.28] medium info was just about like taking
[1520.16 - 1524.84] away everybody's food far from it it's
[1523.28 - 1528.26] about giving you options you never
[1524.84 - 1530.12] thought you could use or do and then
[1528.26 - 1531.14] having those options to help heal the
[1530.12 - 1534.68] body
[1531.14 - 1536.00] everybody has a choice to make they can
[1534.68 - 1537.86] eat the things they want they have their
[1536.00 - 1542.00] own free will but if they're really sick
[1537.86 - 1544.58] it's good to know why it's okay to
[1542.00 - 1546.32] remove something let's take eggs for an
[1544.58 - 1548.18] example
[1546.32 - 1549.32] viruses love eggs it's their favorite
[1548.18 - 1552.20] food
[1549.32 - 1554.30] out of everything if someone was to say
[1552.20 - 1557.12] aw I'm gonna
[1554.30 - 1560.18] I'm gonna take all your food away from
[1557.12 - 1562.46] you but I'm just gonna leave you a few
[1560.18 - 1564.14] options I'm Gonna Leave You this roasted
[1562.46 - 1566.12] chicken I'm Gonna Leave You this
[1564.14 - 1568.22] chocolate cake I'm Gonna Leave You this
[1566.12 - 1569.78] cheese and I'm Gonna Leave You these
[1568.22 - 1571.40] eggs
[1569.78 - 1574.28] and they said that's all you're gonna
[1571.40 - 1576.68] have you're gonna starve to death unless
[1574.28 - 1581.00] you choose one of these unless you
[1576.68 - 1583.52] choose eggs or cheese or chicken
[1581.00 - 1586.34] or chocolate cake
[1583.52 - 1588.92] and weeks go by and I haven't eaten any
[1586.34 - 1591.20] of those and I have to make a choice and
[1588.92 - 1593.24] I know I have to make a choice I'm going
[1591.20 - 1594.50] to tell you right now I'm not going to
[1593.24 - 1596.54] choose
[1594.50 - 1599.30] the egg
[1596.54 - 1600.14] the last thing I would ever choose is
[1599.30 - 1601.82] the egg
[1600.14 - 1603.38] and you'll see out there people saying
[1601.82 - 1605.24] eggs are so good for you eggs are
[1603.38 - 1607.28] important eggs are filled with protein
[1605.24 - 1610.34] you should have all the eggs you want
[1607.28 - 1612.62] you should never not eat eggs the egg
[1610.34 - 1613.58] yolks are good though egg whites are
[1612.62 - 1615.56] good
[1613.58 - 1619.10] you should be on eggs you'll hear that
[1615.56 - 1621.14] all day long out there everywhere
[1619.10 - 1622.64] but that's the last thing I would choose
[1621.14 - 1626.12] because
[1622.64 - 1629.30] if there's ever a bacteria or a pathogen
[1626.12 - 1633.14] or anything in the body the egg will
[1629.30 - 1636.14] feed it if there's anything in there the
[1633.14 - 1637.46] egg will feed it and that's important to
[1636.14 - 1639.68] know
[1637.46 - 1641.18] cheese and dairy will feed viruses and
[1639.68 - 1642.98] pathogens
[1641.18 - 1645.80] and that's another thing too that feeds
[1642.98 - 1648.38] viruses and pathogens the chickens not
[1645.80 - 1651.02] my favorite go-to because it's so high
[1648.38 - 1652.82] in fat people don't realize that it's at
[1651.02 - 1655.40] the highest in fat but it's actually
[1652.82 - 1657.26] something that's not my go-to right and
[1655.40 - 1659.00] chocolate Cake's not my go-to because I
[1657.26 - 1660.98] don't want to destroy my adrenal glands
[1659.00 - 1663.26] I want to protect my adrenal glands I
[1660.98 - 1665.48] want to keep my adrenal glands happy and
[1663.26 - 1668.30] I don't want my adrenal glands jacked up
[1665.48 - 1670.10] on all that caffeine and then I don't
[1668.30 - 1671.84] want to be addicted either so that
[1670.10 - 1674.84] wouldn't be my go-to either but
[1671.84 - 1676.34] regardless I wouldn't choose the eggs
[1674.84 - 1677.78] so I want to go into some more symptoms
[1676.34 - 1680.66] conditions how many of you guys are
[1677.78 - 1682.64] dealing with ticks spasms
[1680.66 - 1684.98] where you have them on your body all the
[1682.64 - 1686.84] time you feel them in your arms you feel
[1684.98 - 1689.24] them in your chest you feel them in your
[1686.84 - 1692.42] your eyes you feel them around your eyes
[1689.24 - 1693.56] you feel them on the sides of your face
[1692.42 - 1696.14] okay
[1693.56 - 1698.48] so many people are dealing with a lot of
[1696.14 - 1700.76] the different ticks and spasms
[1698.48 - 1702.08] so ticks and spasms can be a combination
[1700.76 - 1704.12] where you're dealing with low grade
[1702.08 - 1705.92] viral infections but you're also dealing
[1704.12 - 1707.18] with toxic heavy metals and that's the
[1705.92 - 1708.80] next thing I want to go into a little
[1707.18 - 1711.14] bit
[1708.80 - 1712.64] it's one thing to have viruses inside of
[1711.14 - 1714.50] us creating neurological symptoms
[1712.64 - 1716.78] through inflammation caused by
[1714.50 - 1719.90] neurotoxins being released from the
[1716.78 - 1722.66] viral infections so viruses eating foods
[1719.90 - 1725.30] that it likes such as eggs and then
[1722.66 - 1726.80] releasing neurotoxins that get onto the
[1725.30 - 1728.96] nerves and inflame them it's one thing
[1726.80 - 1730.52] to have that it's another to also be
[1728.96 - 1733.40] high in toxic heavy metals without
[1730.52 - 1735.20] realizing it and a blood test does not
[1733.40 - 1738.44] determine how high you are in toxic
[1735.20 - 1741.56] heavy metals nor do a hair analysis or a
[1738.44 - 1744.44] urine analysis will not determine how
[1741.56 - 1747.98] high you are in toxic heavy metals that
[1744.44 - 1749.48] is an important understanding if you
[1747.98 - 1750.98] want to heal because you can be thrown
[1749.48 - 1752.90] off your game
[1750.98 - 1754.82] you go and you get a test or a hair
[1752.90 - 1756.68] analysis for toxic heavy metals doesn't
[1754.82 - 1758.18] look like it's a big problem but you're
[1756.68 - 1759.38] struggling with symptoms and conditions
[1758.18 - 1761.66] you don't think you need to do anything
[1759.38 - 1763.40] about it but here's how it works toxic
[1761.66 - 1766.04] heavy metals burrow themselves deep
[1763.40 - 1768.50] within organs
[1766.04 - 1770.36] deep inside the brain
[1768.50 - 1772.28] deep inside the liver
[1770.36 - 1773.84] they sit in there and they're not
[1772.28 - 1776.42] available
[1773.84 - 1779.42] to be drawn out of the blood they're not
[1776.42 - 1781.94] easily available to be taken out of the
[1779.42 - 1784.34] blood for an analysis
[1781.94 - 1788.06] for a viewing
[1784.34 - 1790.28] they hide and they stay dormant and
[1788.06 - 1792.38] that's what metals do they can stay in
[1790.28 - 1793.64] your bones and never show up in the
[1792.38 - 1796.66] bloodstream when someone's getting
[1793.64 - 1796.66] tested on any level
[1797.06 - 1801.86] biggest reason behind autoimmune
[1800.18 - 1804.82] and chronic health conditions like
[1801.86 - 1804.82] neurological symptoms
[1805.34 - 1811.58] is toxic heavy metals
[1808.28 - 1813.50] and viruses and pathogens
[1811.58 - 1814.70] toxic heavy metals and viruses and
[1813.50 - 1817.04] pathogens
[1814.70 - 1819.26] it's the biggest combination
[1817.04 - 1821.12] viruses tend to like to feed off of
[1819.26 - 1823.22] toxic heavy metals the more toxic heavy
[1821.12 - 1824.78] metals somebody has the more neurotoxins
[1823.22 - 1826.88] the virus can produce making somebody
[1824.78 - 1829.22] feel like that got chronic inflammation
[1826.88 - 1831.56] brain inflammation they feel like they
[1829.22 - 1834.20] got sandbags on their feet their arms
[1831.56 - 1837.16] they can't function and the brain fog is
[1834.20 - 1837.16] out of control
[1838.58 - 1842.30] and you guys know you guys have dealt
[1840.56 - 1843.68] with brain fog you've dealt with all
[1842.30 - 1846.38] kinds of different issues different

[1883.58 - 1887.06] get back to it
[1885.38 - 1890.48] on IG
[1887.06 - 1893.30] how can you detox from heavy metals good
[1890.48 - 1895.82] question heavy metals don't just leave
[1893.30 - 1898.34] heavy metals don't just get up and leave
[1895.82 - 1900.74] hey I'm gonna get up now I'm a toxic
[1898.34 - 1902.30] heavy metal and I'm going to get up and
[1900.74 - 1904.82] I'm going to walk on out of that
[1902.30 - 1907.22] person's body maybe that person can Will
[1904.82 - 1909.80] me out with their mind maybe that person
[1907.22 - 1911.30] hey that person's willing me out I'm
[1909.80 - 1912.74] going to be a toxic heavy metal and
[1911.30 - 1914.54] leave the person's body and that person
[1912.74 - 1917.54] is going to manifest me right out of the
[1914.54 - 1919.46] body just like that and hey if I try all
[1917.54 - 1921.80] these different things maybe that'll
[1919.46 - 1923.24] help too maybe some zeolite will help
[1921.80 - 1926.38] maybe something else will help maybe
[1923.24 - 1929.60] something but it's not it's not
[1926.38 - 1931.16] Metals don't go and they don't go with a
[1929.60 - 1933.62] lot of the trendy crap that's out there
[1931.16 - 1935.84] they don't remove metals
[1933.62 - 1938.24] it's not how it works
[1935.84 - 1942.26] in order to truly get Metals out of the
[1938.24 - 1943.76] body you need five ingredients that I've
[1942.26 - 1945.26] talked about check out the heavy metal
[1943.76 - 1948.26] detox smoothie
[1945.26 - 1949.82] check it out when you get the chance
[1948.26 - 1952.46] if you look here at brain saver
[1949.82 - 1954.44] protocols
[1952.46 - 1957.74] heavy metal detox cleanses in here
[1954.44 - 1959.66] Advanced heavy metal detox cleanses
[1957.74 - 1960.56] there's a heavy metal detox smoothie in
[1959.66 - 1964.16] here too
[1960.56 - 1965.72] so you'll see the ways to get Metals out
[1964.16 - 1969.20] and guess what
[1965.72 - 1973.22] this heavy metal detox smoothie and
[1969.20 - 1975.32] cleanse is the most known and popular in
[1973.22 - 1977.78] the world of Health for getting Metals
[1975.32 - 1980.00] out because it works so much so that so
[1977.78 - 1981.86] many people have ripped off
[1980.00 - 1983.42] ripped off
[1981.86 - 1985.88] the ideas
[1983.42 - 1987.74] right they'll take one ingredient two
[1985.88 - 1989.12] ingredients from the heavy metal detox
[1987.74 - 1991.64] smoothie and then they'll add something
[1989.12 - 1994.16] they want to sell or something to it
[1991.64 - 1995.90] but this is by far hands down the way to
[1994.16 - 1997.22] get Metals out I've said it so many
[1995.90 - 1999.38] times over the years and so many people
[1997.22 - 2001.78] got their lives back after they got rid
[1999.38 - 2004.30] of their metals
[2001.78 - 2007.48] Ian Lampson said what about emotionally
[2004.30 - 2008.98] charged shakes okay that's really a good
[2007.48 - 2011.80] point
[2008.98 - 2014.14] okay let's hit it
[2011.80 - 2015.88] if your nerves are inflamed like your
[2014.14 - 2019.54] vagus nerves
[2015.88 - 2023.46] endophrenic nerves and they're inflamed
[2019.54 - 2023.46] an adrenaline surge occurs
[2025.00 - 2030.22] them nerves are gonna light that up
[2028.30 - 2034.84] did you hear that bleep
[2030.22 - 2036.76] them nerves are gonna light the freak up
[2034.84 - 2038.44] that's what they're gonna do that's what
[2036.76 - 2041.80] they're gonna do that's emotionally
[2038.44 - 2044.38] charged shakes emotionally charged
[2041.80 - 2046.48] nervous system conditions
[2044.38 - 2048.40] when you get jacked up because you're
[2046.48 - 2049.78] getting emotionally triggered you're
[2048.40 - 2050.98] getting triggered by something happening
[2049.78 - 2053.86] something that's out of your control
[2050.98 - 2056.08] someone said some stuff about you maybe
[2053.86 - 2058.96] it's family maybe it's friends maybe
[2056.08 - 2061.66] it's co-workers whatever it is maybe
[2058.96 - 2064.30] someone's just talking crap and talking
[2061.66 - 2066.82] smack and you had enough and you're just
[2064.30 - 2068.86] finally pissed and it hits you and
[2066.82 - 2071.86] you're just charged up and now you're
[2068.86 - 2074.38] just shaking you feel it internally you
[2071.86 - 2075.76] feel it in your hands and your knees you
[2074.38 - 2078.94] just feel it and you're getting those
[2075.76 - 2081.46] emotionally charged shakes
[2078.94 - 2083.38] you have to have sensitive nerves for
[2081.46 - 2085.06] the most part for those emotionally
[2083.38 - 2086.74] charged shakes
[2085.06 - 2087.88] sensitive nerves
[2086.74 - 2089.62] but
[2087.88 - 2091.60] you could be somebody pretty solid
[2089.62 - 2093.94] pretty tough
[2091.60 - 2095.68] and still get them
[2093.94 - 2097.12] but if you're somebody who's really
[2095.68 - 2099.52] sensitive you've been through a lot
[2097.12 - 2101.26] you're been chronically sick you have
[2099.52 - 2102.94] neurological symptoms already you're
[2101.26 - 2106.18] dealing with a lot and then you get a
[2102.94 - 2108.94] jab at you then you get a trigger at you
[2106.18 - 2110.74] oh man you can be going through ticks
[2108.94 - 2113.32] and spasms you could be spasming
[2110.74 - 2115.90] everywhere you can be shaking you can be
[2113.32 - 2118.36] sick your stomach can be flipping you
[2115.90 - 2120.16] can be a really really feeling it when
[2118.36 - 2122.80] you get an emotional jab an emotional
[2120.16 - 2124.36] hit you can really feel it and it could
[2122.80 - 2126.40] be a really hard
[2124.36 - 2127.90] really hard
[2126.40 - 2129.70] and I've seen people go through that
[2127.90 - 2131.44] it's really difficult for a lot of
[2129.70 - 2133.24] people you can be somebody that's more
[2131.44 - 2135.28] solid meaning you're not that sick
[2133.24 - 2136.90] you're not that chronically sick you
[2135.28 - 2139.36] haven't had enough problems with that
[2136.90 - 2141.28] you haven't had that much go on and then
[2139.36 - 2142.72] someone gives you a jab someone triggers
[2141.28 - 2144.52] you and you got the you got the
[2142.72 - 2145.48] emotional shakes you got the emotional
[2144.52 - 2147.82] shakes
[2145.48 - 2149.38] it's not tanking you it's not taking you
[2147.82 - 2151.30] down to the ground
[2149.38 - 2153.28] depends on what the news is depends on
[2151.30 - 2154.84] what it is that's triggering you what
[2153.28 - 2156.52] I'm trying to say is if you're sensitive
[2154.84 - 2157.84] and you're hypersensitive and your vagus
[2156.52 - 2159.04] nerves are inflamed and your phrenic
[2157.84 - 2160.84] nerves are inflamed and you're going
[2159.04 - 2163.00] through a lot you're gonna feel it
[2160.84 - 2164.20] you're gonna get jacked up from it your
[2163.00 - 2165.40] nerves are going to move a little bit
[2164.20 - 2166.66] more and they're going to shake a little
[2165.40 - 2168.10] bit more they're going to Spas them a
[2166.66 - 2170.26] little bit more and you're going to
[2168.10 - 2171.94] struggle
[2170.26 - 2173.74] reason why
[2171.94 - 2175.00] because the adrenaline is going to flood
[2173.74 - 2176.98] your system and it's going to touch
[2175.00 - 2178.24] those inflamed nerves and those inflamed
[2176.98 - 2179.32] nerves are going to go on fire and
[2178.24 - 2181.90] they're going to light up they're going
[2179.32 - 2183.58] to just light right up
[2181.90 - 2186.36] because that adrenaline's just going to
[2183.58 - 2189.04] go someone pisses you off
[2186.36 - 2190.30] adrenaline just do that like out of the
[2189.04 - 2191.98] adrenal
[2190.30 - 2193.36] adrenaline just
[2191.98 - 2194.68] and then you've got this blend of
[2193.36 - 2196.30] adrenaline and I talk about the medical
[2194.68 - 2198.10] meaning books it comes out and it's like
[2196.30 - 2200.32] it could be a fear-based adrenaline it
[2198.10 - 2202.42] could be an anger-based adrenaline it
[2200.32 - 2204.58] could be a sad based adrenaline and as
[2202.42 - 2206.86] it's coming up coming out it's corrosive
[2204.58 - 2208.12] and that corrosive adrenaline lands on
[2206.86 - 2209.74] the nerves and if your nerves are
[2208.12 - 2211.72] sensitive you're going to be feeling it
[2209.74 - 2213.40] and damn that trigger is going to feel
[2211.72 - 2215.64] like it's taken you down and taken you
[2213.40 - 2215.64] out
[2217.84 - 2221.86] cold white spring nobody knew anything
[2220.30 - 2223.84] about Metals before the first medical
[2221.86 - 2225.28] medium book I have to agree in fact I
[2223.84 - 2226.18] was talking to a practitioner the other
[2225.28 - 2228.22] day
[2226.18 - 2230.80] a well-known practitioner
[2228.22 - 2232.78] who's been around who saw everything
[2230.80 - 2234.34] before the first medical medium book
[2232.78 - 2236.68] came out and that well-known
[2234.34 - 2238.66] practitioner told me ain't nobody knew
[2236.68 - 2240.64] anything about Metals aw that's what
[2238.66 - 2242.74] they said nobody knew anything about
[2240.64 - 2246.46] Metals before the first medical medium
[2242.74 - 2249.28] book came out in 2015 I concur greatly I
[2246.46 - 2251.80] agree and I will even say in
[2249.28 - 2254.56] in British English
[2251.80 - 2257.16] indeed
[2254.56 - 2257.16] anyway
[2258.46 - 2261.06] okay
[2264.78 - 2270.46] indeed indeed
[2268.24 - 2272.74] yes
[2270.46 - 2274.62] us Royals we're talking really good
[2272.74 - 2277.48] English
[2274.62 - 2279.70] language the proper kind
[2277.48 - 2282.18] indeed
[2279.70 - 2282.18] okay
[2283.24 - 2289.18] I just want to say this
[2287.20 - 2291.88] nerves can heal
[2289.18 - 2294.10] your central nervous system can heal
[2291.88 - 2295.54] your vagus nerves can heal your phrenic
[2294.10 - 2297.82] nerves can heal your trigeminal nerves
[2295.54 - 2299.56] can heal your nerves
[2297.82 - 2302.38] can heal
[2299.56 - 2304.66] they just need the things they need and
[2302.38 - 2306.46] they need time they need some patience
[2304.66 - 2308.26] but I understand because when you've
[2306.46 - 2309.94] been sick for a long time
[2308.26 - 2313.42] and you've been down and out for a long
[2309.94 - 2316.60] time patience this grows weary and grows
[2313.42 - 2318.64] weary and patience Thins and it Thins
[2316.60 - 2320.32] and it Thins
[2318.64 - 2323.80] and I understand
[2320.32 - 2326.14] I totally get that I do
[2323.80 - 2328.42] so even when you've been given an answer
[2326.14 - 2330.40] and you've got a direction if your
[2328.42 - 2333.16] patience has been out and you've
[2330.40 - 2334.72] struggled long enough it's hard to just
[2333.16 - 2335.92] say you know what I'm gonna do this you
[2334.72 - 2337.84] know what I'm going to commit and I'm
[2335.92 - 2340.72] gonna make this happen but I'm promising
[2337.84 - 2342.58] this that your nerves want to heal every
[2340.72 - 2344.08] single one of your cranial nerves it
[2342.58 - 2347.74] causes all the different symptoms
[2344.08 - 2350.26] conditions and problems wants to heal so
[2347.74 - 2351.94] many people have hearing conditions
[2350.26 - 2353.62] they're dealing with like cochlear
[2351.94 - 2355.90] nerves so many people are dealing with
[2353.62 - 2357.82] so many different nerve problems have a
[2355.90 - 2359.56] glossal nerves with taste and tongue
[2357.82 - 2361.72] problems and mouth problems you're
[2359.56 - 2364.06] dealing with facial nerves facial ticks
[2361.72 - 2368.08] and spasms trigeminal nerves
[2364.06 - 2371.44] optic nerves too so many people
[2368.08 - 2374.14] have uh optic neuritis and they're
[2371.44 - 2377.26] dealing with inflamed swollen optic
[2374.14 - 2379.72] nerves deep inside their head and
[2377.26 - 2381.22] they're suffering from double vision and
[2379.72 - 2383.68] all kinds of other issues that are not
[2381.22 - 2385.60] explained
[2383.68 - 2387.76] and they got lesions on their optic
[2385.60 - 2389.62] nerves from all kinds of neurotoxins
[2387.76 - 2391.84] from viruses
[2389.62 - 2394.30] Emily harridan says could you please
[2391.84 - 2396.58] talk about working out while trying to
[2394.30 - 2398.68] heal your nerves I feel well enough to
[2396.58 - 2401.68] work out and Miss cardio and strength
[2398.68 - 2405.70] but need to heal post
[2401.68 - 2409.06] plaque tight chest in Tim Okay so
[2405.70 - 2411.46] first of all walking if you can walk is
[2409.06 - 2414.94] critical anybody
[2411.46 - 2418.06] anybody walking is miraculous
[2414.94 - 2421.00] it is powerful don't underestimate it on
[2418.06 - 2423.40] any level if you're somebody that
[2421.00 - 2425.20] wasn't sick at one time in your life and
[2423.40 - 2427.54] you're a runner
[2425.20 - 2430.18] your Avid exerciser
[2427.54 - 2432.34] you do weights whatever you do you might
[2430.18 - 2433.84] think that walking is chump change but
[2432.34 - 2435.22] it's not
[2433.84 - 2438.76] walking
[2435.22 - 2440.98] is one of the most powerful ways to
[2438.76 - 2442.24] exercise while you're healing with
[2440.98 - 2444.94] chronic illness and you're dealing with
[2442.24 - 2446.98] sensitivities and chronic issues and
[2444.94 - 2448.24] neurological problems
[2446.98 - 2451.18] chronic fatigue syndrome and
[2448.24 - 2453.16] fibromyalgia walking's a big one that
[2451.18 - 2454.84] alone is incredible swimming's another
[2453.16 - 2457.24] one too
[2454.84 - 2458.80] I know that a lot of pools are hemmed
[2457.24 - 2460.54] out big time
[2458.80 - 2462.40] they're coming out
[2460.54 - 2464.86] they got a lot of anti you know
[2462.40 - 2466.90] fungicides in there
[2464.86 - 2468.58] for fungus like you know they got a lot
[2466.90 - 2471.04] of different you know chlorine High
[2468.58 - 2472.54] chlorine levels So It's Tricky but any
[2471.04 - 2475.48] kind of swimming in any kind of
[2472.54 - 2478.48] situation that's cleaner than that
[2475.48 - 2481.30] without the high chem is also really
[2478.48 - 2483.88] powerful too walking
[2481.30 - 2486.10] swimming
[2483.88 - 2487.42] these are two options right there that I
[2486.10 - 2488.86] always tell people they should be doing
[2487.42 - 2490.18] depending on each person you might be
[2488.86 - 2491.80] somebody that's able to start doing some
[2490.18 - 2493.36] resistance training
[2491.80 - 2497.38] you might be somebody that's doing just
[2493.36 - 2500.02] baby steps with resistance
[2497.38 - 2501.82] rebounding another great one
[2500.02 - 2503.44] it's another thing too cold wide spring
[2501.82 - 2507.40] no one is talking about rebounding back
[2503.44 - 2509.98] in 2015 and before very few it was one
[2507.40 - 2511.36] of those niches that was tucked away and
[2509.98 - 2512.56] it wasn't for chronically ill it wasn't
[2511.36 - 2514.90] for the chronically ill was it for
[2512.56 - 2518.50] anybody it was just one of those things
[2514.90 - 2520.54] the mini trampoline they called it
[2518.50 - 2524.08] and I talked about it in the medical
[2520.54 - 2526.36] medium Book 2015
[2524.08 - 2528.82] I talked about rebounding that's another
[2526.36 - 2531.52] one for The Chronic chronically ill it's
[2528.82 - 2533.56] a great one it could be rebounding for
[2531.52 - 2535.30] one minute a day
[2533.56 - 2536.68] with counting it you're watching the
[2535.30 - 2538.36] minute and you're rebounding for one
[2536.68 - 2539.98] minute they gotta understand something
[2538.36 - 2541.30] if you're somebody that you're not sick
[2539.98 - 2542.86] you're not struggling you might think
[2541.30 - 2543.94] this is a joke when I say one minute a
[2542.86 - 2545.56] day of rebounding but when you're
[2543.94 - 2547.90] struggling you just got off a mattress
[2545.56 - 2550.14] Island walking to the bathroom is an
[2547.90 - 2550.14] exercise
[2550.78 - 2554.26] keeping a pedometer on you is actually
[2552.76 - 2556.66] not a bad idea if you're somebody coming
[2554.26 - 2558.58] back from chronic illness just seeing
[2556.66 - 2559.96] how many steps you take in the house as
[2558.58 - 2561.64] you're recovering
[2559.96 - 2564.10] you're like okay you know what I took
[2561.64 - 2565.48] 500 steps today sounds like a joke it's
[2564.10 - 2566.92] not a joke for somebody with chronic
[2565.48 - 2569.44] illness you could barely take a shower
[2566.92 - 2571.66] 500 steps is a miracle so I'm saying I'm
[2569.44 - 2573.64] taking it Taking us down to that area
[2571.66 - 2575.14] and moving us up maybe there's somebody
[2573.64 - 2576.46] that just deals with a little fatigue
[2575.14 - 2577.78] and you're fighting for it you want to
[2576.46 - 2579.66] do your run and you want to do your
[2577.78 - 2582.88] cardio you want to do your weights
[2579.66 - 2585.10] incredible if you can do that incredible
[2582.88 - 2586.90] rehab Takes Time coming back from a
[2585.10 - 2587.92] chronic illness it takes time and
[2586.90 - 2590.68] patience
[2587.92 - 2592.48] so rehabbing from that takes time any
[2590.68 - 2594.16] steps you take any walking you do
[2592.48 - 2595.78] standing upright so I want to say this
[2594.16 - 2597.70] for people who are really sick and
[2595.78 - 2599.86] chronically chronically ill they've been
[2597.70 - 2601.30] on mattress Island Medical medium term
[2599.86 - 2603.94] mattress style and now I hear people
[2601.30 - 2606.46] saying it out there
[2603.94 - 2609.40] mattress Island
[2606.46 - 2611.62] it's okay if walking around your house
[2609.40 - 2614.68] and in your kitchen and standing upright
[2611.62 - 2616.78] is your exercise because you're laying
[2614.68 - 2618.94] flat so much so many people they're sick
[2616.78 - 2621.04] for a long term they lay flat all the
[2618.94 - 2622.54] time or they lay flat they lay sitting
[2621.04 - 2625.38] up right they lay sitting up in their
[2622.54 - 2625.38] bed like this
[2625.48 - 2630.46] so
[2626.94 - 2632.98] standing that alone is an exercise for
[2630.46 - 2635.68] somebody who's been bedridden somebody
[2632.98 - 2638.56] that's been on mattress Island standing
[2635.68 - 2640.78] walking in their house keeping a
[2638.56 - 2645.04] pedometer counting the steps all that
[2640.78 - 2647.44] matters nothing is small time
[2645.04 - 2650.02] 50 steps for somebody could be big time
[2647.44 - 2652.00] 500 steps could be big time keep that in
[2650.02 - 2654.28] mind now let's go a little bit more say
[2652.00 - 2656.20] somebody they just have some aches and
[2654.28 - 2657.52] pains here and there they're trying to
[2656.20 - 2659.02] control it with whatever they're doing
[2657.52 - 2660.82] out there
[2659.02 - 2662.62] right
[2660.82 - 2664.42] they can run
[2662.62 - 2665.92] they can do some resistance training
[2664.42 - 2668.32] they can do some workouts they can get a
[2665.92 - 2670.06] trainer whatever it is fine that's great
[2668.32 - 2673.00] if you're somebody coming back and
[2670.06 - 2674.68] rehabbing some rebounding swimming if
[2673.00 - 2677.34] it's possible if you have the resources
[2674.68 - 2677.34] the option
[2677.44 - 2685.12] riding a bicycle stationary bicycle
[2681.52 - 2687.34] walking on a treadmill walking outside
[2685.12 - 2689.08] all of that can count all of that is
[2687.34 - 2691.72] helpful
[2689.08 - 2693.58] and that's the start
[2691.72 - 2695.56] it's hard to go just from being in
[2693.58 - 2698.28] mattress Island straight to an advanced
[2695.56 - 2698.28] yoga class
[2698.38 - 2705.96] it's hard to be on mattress Island and
[2701.08 - 2705.96] move to an advanced boom a 10 mile run
[2706.24 - 2710.08] really really hard gotta have patience
[2708.58 - 2712.42] and you get to take one day at a time
[2710.08 - 2714.90] and you gotta baby step it for your
[2712.42 - 2714.90] recovery
[2716.62 - 2725.02] Steph says you say don't let your feet
[2720.70 - 2728.74] leave the trampoline when rebounding why
[2725.02 - 2732.64] you have much more gravity occur when it
[2728.74 - 2735.16] doesn't leave you're utilizing
[2732.64 - 2737.20] and manipulating gravity
[2735.16 - 2739.74] when you keep your feet still on the
[2737.20 - 2739.74] rebounder
[2739.84 - 2743.02] you would think it's the opposite you
[2741.58 - 2744.40] jump off the rebounder you're gonna have
[2743.02 - 2745.48] more gravities you're coming down not
[2744.40 - 2748.84] true
[2745.48 - 2750.70] because you're you you have lost control
[2748.84 - 2754.12] the minute you jump on the rebounder and
[2750.70 - 2757.48] this is this is SOC information
[2754.12 - 2760.30] okay giving it to you right here
[2757.48 - 2761.98] the minute you purposely try to leave
[2760.30 - 2764.28] your rebounder you're not in control
[2761.98 - 2764.28] anymore
[2765.22 - 2770.38] you're not in control anymore
[2767.44 - 2773.38] you can do it if you want
[2770.38 - 2776.08] that means you can't manipulate gravity
[2773.38 - 2778.12] with your own body's Force
[2776.08 - 2780.94] you're getting less of a workout when
[2778.12 - 2782.44] you leave the trampoline when you leave
[2780.94 - 2784.24] the rebounder and you leave the mini
[2782.44 - 2786.04] trampoline and you're going up and
[2784.24 - 2788.38] you're doing the jump up you want to go
[2786.04 - 2790.84] up high off there you just lost control
[2788.38 - 2792.88] and you're not now you're you can't
[2790.84 - 2794.68] manipulate gravity anymore with your own
[2792.88 - 2798.04] Force
[2794.68 - 2800.02] with your own body's Force
[2798.04 - 2803.08] you've lost control
[2800.02 - 2805.48] you get less action happening within the
[2803.08 - 2810.70] body less results
[2805.48 - 2812.98] less blood flow less lymphatic drainage
[2810.70 - 2814.30] less everything
[2812.98 - 2816.70] so if you're somebody and you're leaving
[2814.30 - 2819.16] your rebounder and you're going up up
[2816.70 - 2821.56] down up down like this your lymphatic
[2819.16 - 2823.36] system isn't going to be benefited as
[2821.56 - 2824.92] much hardly
[2823.36 - 2826.66] but when you keep your feet on that
[2824.92 - 2828.52] rebounder and you're going down and
[2826.66 - 2830.62] you're still stay on that rebounder just
[2828.52 - 2832.54] about and you're not really going off of
[2830.62 - 2835.18] it you're now controlling and
[2832.54 - 2837.16] manipulating gravity itself you're using
[2835.18 - 2839.74] your body's Force to do it you're
[2837.16 - 2841.60] focused you're concentrating your brain
[2839.74 - 2843.58] is actually wired to what you're doing
[2841.60 - 2845.08] you want to jump up off that trampoline
[2843.58 - 2846.82] and be off the ground your brain all of
[2845.08 - 2850.12] a sudden stops working
[2846.82 - 2852.22] it stops navigating
[2850.12 - 2854.74] you're not able to manipulate gravity
[2852.22 - 2856.54] anymore you're not using more
[2854.74 - 2859.06] introskeletal muscles and you're not
[2856.54 - 2860.08] draining your lymphatic system the way
[2859.06 - 2862.24] you should you're not getting anything
[2860.08 - 2863.74] you're not getting more play so that's
[2862.24 - 2865.60] why it's important to keep your feet on
[2863.74 - 2870.28] top of the
[2865.60 - 2873.16] mini trampoline on top of the rebounder
[2870.28 - 2875.76] important tip
[2873.16 - 2875.76] you're welcome
[2880.48 - 2885.28] oh
