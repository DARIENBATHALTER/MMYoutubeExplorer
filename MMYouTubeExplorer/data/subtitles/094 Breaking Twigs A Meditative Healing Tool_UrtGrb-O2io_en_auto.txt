[1.28 - 7.76] How many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health? Chances are, whether
[7.76 - 14.56] they show it or not, most of the people
[10.24 - 16.24] in your life do. And chances are, you're
[14.56 - 18.64] one of them.
[16.24 - 22.52] Whether you're dealing with anxiety,
[18.64 - 26.00] depression, endometriosis, acne, eczema,
[22.52 - 28.40] autoimmune, thyroid, lime, brain fog,
[26.00 - 31.32] fatigue, or any other symptom or
[28.40 - 34.48] condition, you're far from
[31.32 - 37.76] alone. Living with symptoms has become
[34.48 - 41.44] the new normal. So, no more guessing
[37.76 - 43.84] games. It's time to get answers. Welcome
[41.44 - 46.00] to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm
[43.84 - 48.88] Anthony William.
[46.00 - 51.36] We're talking about breaking twigs, a
[48.88 - 53.68] powerful therapy, something that's
[51.36 - 56.96] life-changing and even lifealtering in
[53.68 - 58.80] so many ways. A powerful rewiring tool
[56.96 - 62.32] that Spirit of Compassion brought to my
[58.80 - 65.36] attention since I was a child. Now, this
[62.32 - 67.36] spiritual healing therapy I talked about
[65.36 - 69.60] a little bit in one of the spring
[67.36 - 71.84] episodes, but like many of the spiritual
[69.60 - 74.72] tools from Spirit of Compassion, this
[71.84 - 77.04] one deserves its own episode. Get ready
[74.72 - 79.92] and be prepared for this one. Get
[77.04 - 81.92] yourself outside. It's springtime and
[79.92 - 85.28] you can do this any time of year. Could
[81.92 - 87.52] be spring, winter, fall, summer. Gather
[85.28 - 90.48] up a bunch of tiny twigs. They could be
[87.52 - 93.04] nice and small, thin, anything you think
[90.48 - 94.32] you can break between your fingertips.
[93.04 - 96.72] We're going to talk about how to do
[94.32 - 99.76] this, what the powerful healing
[96.72 - 103.20] mechanisms are within it. Get yourself a
[99.76 - 106.60] spot outside. Relax. This powerful
[103.20 - 109.20] healing spiritual tool and meditation is
[106.60 - 110.96] life-changing. I'm so excited. I can't
[109.20 - 113.36] wait for you to experience it. I'm
[110.96 - 116.72] getting myself in a nice good spot right
[113.36 - 116.72] now and let's get
[117.32 - 122.40] started. So, I'm sitting outside right
[119.68 - 126.40] now and it's springtime. I just saw a
[122.40 - 127.48] baby squirrel run across the lawn. I
[126.40 - 130.40] hear the
[127.48 - 133.12] birds. Beautiful sounds of spring. So,
[130.40 - 134.84] now I'm going to get up and take a walk.
[133.12 - 137.04] And I'm going to look for the right
[134.84 - 138.72] twigs. You don't want the twigs too
[137.04 - 141.52] thick. You don't want them where you
[138.72 - 144.24] can't snap them. You don't want them
[141.52 - 147.36] where it hurts to snap them. You don't
[144.24 - 149.52] want twigs and sticks really tough,
[147.36 - 151.92] really thick, where you're hurting your
[149.52 - 154.56] hands or your wrists, or you're
[151.92 - 157.76] struggling or straining to snap the
[154.56 - 160.72] twigs. It's not about taking big sticks
[157.76 - 162.80] and breaking them in half on your knee
[160.72 - 165.28] or breaking them in half with all your
[162.80 - 167.84] strength and all your might. That's not
[165.28 - 170.24] what this powerful exercise and healing
[167.84 - 173.16] spiritual tool is. You want to look for
[170.24 - 176.56] the smaller twigs, the ones that are
[173.16 - 178.80] nimble, the ones that can break easy.
[176.56 - 181.92] Sometimes so easy you can snap them with
[178.80 - 184.88] just your thumbnail, just your fingers.
[181.92 - 187.32] because it's not about using strength.
[184.88 - 190.96] It's not about using all your
[187.32 - 193.20] might. It's about barely using any of
[190.96 - 197.04] that at all. So, I see some nice twigs
[193.20 - 198.80] now on the ground right in the grass.
[197.04 - 200.64] And I'm going to just bend over here and
[198.80 - 202.80] pick them up. Now, depending on what
[200.64 - 205.12] kind of trees you have or what kind of
[202.80 - 207.20] shrubbery because you can get twigs off
[205.12 - 209.36] of shrubbery, too. And you're not
[207.20 - 212.24] looking for new ones. You're looking for
[209.36 - 214.64] old ones that have fallen. Maybe last
[212.24 - 217.28] year in the fall they fell. Maybe they
[214.64 - 219.52] fell the year before. Maybe birds
[217.28 - 222.84] dropped them along the way. And keep in
[219.52 - 226.00] mind that you're not trying to snap
[222.84 - 228.16] living twigs off of shrubs and bushes
[226.00 - 231.44] and trees. You're looking for twigs of
[228.16 - 233.44] yester year of last year. Twigs that can
[231.44 - 236.24] easily break and they're scattered
[233.44 - 238.16] about. Sometimes a little hard to find
[236.24 - 240.96] depending on where you are and sometimes
[238.16 - 244.08] really easy. and many are there and
[240.96 - 247.12] available. So, I'm walking around and
[244.08 - 249.92] I'm looking for my twigs and sticks. So,
[247.12 - 252.88] here I go. Now, some can be really
[249.92 - 255.16] skinny skinny twigs, like really thin,
[252.88 - 257.60] like eighth of an inch
[255.16 - 260.80] diameter. If you go into like quarter of
[257.60 - 262.36] an inch, half an inch, keep in mind that
[260.80 - 265.44] you want to make sure you can break
[262.36 - 268.64] them. You want to break them easily with
[265.44 - 270.24] your thumbnails, your fingers. So, I'm
[268.64 - 272.28] grabbing twigs and sticks. If I find
[270.24 - 275.76] something that's a/ an inch
[272.28 - 277.68] diameter, I'm making sure that it's
[275.76 - 280.48] dead, you know, and it's doesn't have
[277.68 - 282.72] any leftover juice in it from last year
[280.48 - 283.92] or years before. And you can tell, you
[282.72 - 285.60] know, it's a twig. You know, it's going
[283.92 - 287.12] to break pretty easy. Now, you don't
[285.60 - 289.28] have to count how many twigs. You can
[287.12 - 292.64] just get a pile. But often I do like
[289.28 - 295.04] numbers to a certain point only because
[292.64 - 297.12] spirit of compassion gives me inside
[295.04 - 299.68] information, wisdom about numbers that's
[297.12 - 302.24] not out there. Like information about
[299.68 - 304.32] the number nine that hasn't been ever
[302.24 - 307.76] talked about by numerologists and so
[304.32 - 311.52] forth and spiritualists, but I like to
[307.76 - 313.04] kind of like add up the sticks. So I'm
[311.52 - 315.76] counting them now. I'm on my fifth
[313.04 - 319.36] stick, sixth stick, seven, eighth stick,
[315.76 - 322.16] nine twig, 10 twig, 11 twig. And I'm
[319.36 - 324.16] going to probably land on 18, which is a
[322.16 - 326.08] nine, one and eight or a nine. But like
[324.16 - 327.84] I said before, you can just grab a pile
[326.08 - 330.64] of sticks and twigs. And you don't have
[327.84 - 333.12] to have a number associated with any of
[330.64 - 335.76] it. But as I'm going along, I see other
[333.12 - 337.60] twigs I like. So I'm going to keep on
[335.76 - 343.48] adding them to my bunch of twigs right
[337.60 - 347.76] here. So, you got 19 20 21 22 23
[343.48 - 351.12] 24 25. Here's a nice one right here. 26.
[347.76 - 353.60] And let me go over here. 27. I'm going
[351.12 - 355.84] to stop at 27. Once again, I like that
[353.60 - 357.12] number because two and seven are nine.
[355.84 - 358.10] So, I'm going to hold that. And I have a
[357.12 - 361.24] nice pile of
[358.10 - 364.24] [Music]
[361.24 - 366.88] twigs. Okay. So, I'm sitting back down.
[364.24 - 369.52] I got my pile of twigs. I'm getting
[366.88 - 372.84] ready. I'm getting in the frame of mind.
[369.52 - 375.00] I'm listening to the birds and the
[372.84 - 378.16] hawks and the
[375.00 - 380.48] geese. And now I'm going to get ready
[378.16 - 383.76] and start this powerful transformational
[380.48 - 385.52] tool, this spiritual meditation and
[383.76 - 387.20] therapy. So, I'm sitting down in the
[385.52 - 389.04] grass right now and you can sit
[387.20 - 390.56] anywhere. You could sit on a porch. You
[389.04 - 392.32] could even be inside a house if that's
[390.56 - 394.64] where you have to be and you have your
[392.32 - 397.48] pile of twigs. I'm in the grass right
[394.64 - 400.48] now. I'm outside and I have my first
[397.48 - 402.56] twig. Do you have yours? Now, what you
[400.48 - 404.88] don't want to do is just snap the twig
[402.56 - 404.88] in
[406.28 - 411.76] half. Instead, you want to snap little
[409.04 - 414.88] pieces off the twig. You can even keep
[411.76 - 417.36] them intact after you snap them. The
[414.88 - 420.00] skin of the twig, the bark, will hold on
[417.36 - 422.72] to them, but you can also separate them
[420.00 - 425.08] as well when you snap them. Each snap
[422.72 - 428.72] can be as close together to the last
[425.08 - 431.36] snap. They can be as close as a quarter
[428.72 - 433.40] inch apart or even less depending on the
[431.36 - 435.92] twig. And you can do it with your
[433.40 - 438.04] thumbnail. But it's okay if it's not
[435.92 - 441.04] that close and they're a little further
[438.04 - 444.16] apart. Half an inch, 3/4 of an inch, or
[441.04 - 447.64] an inch. That's fine, too. So, let's
[444.16 - 447.64] start the snapping.
[458.16 - 462.36] Did you hear the sound of my twig
[460.00 - 464.88] snapping or your twig
[462.36 - 467.76] snapping? Did you really listen to the
[464.88 - 472.08] sound? So, when we do another one, try
[467.76 - 474.48] to listen to each snap, each click, each
[472.08 - 479.28] break of the twig. So, I'm grabbing
[474.48 - 479.28] another twig. And here we go.
[489.04 - 494.08] Now, you can do any speed you like. You
[491.36 - 495.76] can do it fast, you can do it slower,
[494.08 - 497.92] you can have the little twig pieces
[495.76 - 500.64] dropping all over the place, and you can
[497.92 - 503.64] go at your own pace. Here's a faster
[500.64 - 503.64] one.
[514.48 - 521.24] So let's talk about for the moment of
[517.52 - 524.08] what it does. Every single break of that
[521.24 - 527.36] twig, every single snap of that twig
[524.08 - 529.84] that you hear enters your consciousness
[527.36 - 535.04] and your subconsciousness. It enters
[529.84 - 535.04] your mind. It enters the soul.
[545.52 - 551.04] The snapping and breaking of twigs has
[547.68 - 553.88] happened thousands and thousands and
[551.04 - 557.04] hundreds of thousands of times in your
[553.88 - 558.92] life, long before this lifetime. And if
[557.04 - 564.32] your soul is really
[558.92 - 567.44] old, 1,000 years, 2,000 years, 3,000,
[564.32 - 570.08] 4,000 years, or more, then you have
[567.44 - 572.52] heard the snapping twigs throughout all
[570.08 - 575.76] those lifetimes for many different
[572.52 - 578.96] reasons and for many different ways. And
[575.76 - 581.88] your soul harbors that information deep
[578.96 - 584.60] within of every single twig that was
[581.88 - 587.20] snapped. Whether it was for kindling for
[584.60 - 590.00] firewood or thousands of years ago you
[587.20 - 592.56] were gathering up sticks to start a fire
[590.00 - 595.12] to keep warm. Or maybe it was so many
[592.56 - 597.36] journeys through the woods thousands of
[595.12 - 599.12] years ago and your soul has the
[597.36 - 600.64] information of you stepping on twigs
[599.12 - 602.56] everywhere and they were breaking and
[600.64 - 605.76] snapping. And maybe it was for
[602.56 - 608.40] protection reasons. You were in a camp a
[605.76 - 609.72] long long time ago in a past life or in
[608.40 - 612.04] a
[609.72 - 614.88] village and there was a
[612.04 - 618.80] campfire and there was an animal on the
[614.88 - 622.32] outside of the camp walking along and it
[618.80 - 622.32] stepped on twigs and snapped
[622.52 - 627.60] them. But you've heard that sound before
[625.76 - 629.92] and maybe in this lifetime you've heard
[627.60 - 633.12] that sound before.
[629.92 - 636.12] But what this therapy does, what this
[633.12 - 638.72] spiritual tool does is it
[636.12 - 642.00] rewires. It rewires the consciousness,
[638.72 - 643.64] the subconsciousness, the brain. It
[642.00 - 648.24] rewires the
[643.64 - 651.32] soul. It fills the soul. Those sounds of
[648.24 - 654.28] those twigs snapping is a cleansing
[651.32 - 656.36] mechanism, a clearing mechanism that
[654.28 - 658.28] improves mental
[656.36 - 661.04] wellness, mental
[658.28 - 663.80] health, mental sharpness. The
[661.04 - 667.52] combination of feeling the twig in your
[663.80 - 671.32] hand and interacting with nature on this
[667.52 - 675.08] level has imprint removing powers.
[671.32 - 677.68] imprint from negative experience,
[675.08 - 680.64] imprint from problems that have happened
[677.68 - 682.92] in the past, imprints from all kinds of
[680.64 - 685.84] different betrayal, hardships, and
[682.92 - 687.68] losses. So, the next round of twigs we
[685.84 - 691.52] snap, we're going to be thinking about
[687.68 - 692.36] the noises entering into our soul, into
[691.52 - 695.44] our
[692.36 - 700.04] consciousness, into our body, into our
[695.44 - 700.04] physical cells of our body.
[702.56 - 707.88] So, let's start with the physical
[705.00 - 710.48] body. Get a twig in your
[707.88 - 713.48] hand and let's start snapping each
[710.48 - 713.48] piece.
[726.88 - 731.00] The noise coming from the broken twig
[729.92 - 734.96] and the little
[731.00 - 739.64] snaps are entering into the cells of
[734.96 - 741.72] your body. There's a frequency to each
[739.64 - 746.00] snap. That
[741.72 - 749.12] sound easily enters into our being, our
[746.00 - 750.20] physical being, our organs.
[749.12 - 753.72] our
[750.20 - 757.12] brain, our liver, our pancreas, our
[753.72 - 759.60] spleen. And each snap of the twig enters
[757.12 - 762.40] into our neurons. Our electrical
[759.60 - 764.56] impulses are picking up on it. They're
[762.40 - 767.12] receiving information. They're sending
[764.56 - 768.44] that information to each neuron
[767.12 - 771.32] throughout the
[768.44 - 774.12] brain. The spiritual therapeutic
[771.32 - 776.64] technique enters into the physical body
[774.12 - 779.12] easily. And you can feel the sound of
[776.64 - 782.08] the twig snapping each time you snap
[779.12 - 785.20] each piece. You hear the sound, but you
[782.08 - 788.00] can feel the sound, too. And when your
[785.20 - 791.12] fingers are holding it and it's snapping
[788.00 - 792.80] within your fingers, it's also sending a
[791.12 - 794.72] frequency through your hands, through
[792.80 - 798.32] your arms, into your body all the way
[794.72 - 800.16] through. This is a resetter. It resets
[798.32 - 802.88] whatever's happening in your body
[800.16 - 804.96] physically. Whatever frequency or energy
[802.88 - 807.28] you picked up, you're resetting that
[804.96 - 809.76] energy. You're bringing it back to a
[807.28 - 813.00] natural state. You're using nature to
[809.76 - 816.40] set the frequency. And each snap of each
[813.00 - 819.04] twig sets a new frequency within a cell,
[816.40 - 821.36] helps to reset it.
[819.04 - 822.96] Now, twig snapping is so powerful that
[821.36 - 824.96] even if you're not thinking about
[822.96 - 827.04] anything, anything at all. You're not
[824.96 - 828.80] thinking about frequencies. You're not
[827.04 - 830.40] thinking about the soul. You're not
[828.80 - 831.76] thinking about your physical body.
[830.40 - 835.20] You're just sitting there and you're
[831.76 - 837.52] snapping twigs and doing that alone. It
[835.20 - 838.80] is life-changing, lifealtering. So, if
[837.52 - 840.32] you're just sitting there in the grass
[838.80 - 842.08] or on the porch and you're not thinking
[840.32 - 844.88] about anything at all, you're just
[842.08 - 846.64] snapping twigs and focused on the twigs
[844.88 - 848.64] themselves and what you're hearing and
[846.64 - 851.28] what you're feeling. If you're somebody
[848.64 - 853.64] that had a hard night or you had a hard
[851.28 - 857.12] day or you had a confrontation with
[853.64 - 859.60] someone or something was just a let down
[857.12 - 862.56] or you're just emotionally depressed,
[859.60 - 864.20] sad, maybe feeling a little numb, maybe
[862.56 - 866.96] you're battling some
[864.20 - 869.76] depersonalization and you sit down and
[866.96 - 872.16] you start snapping these twigs, it can
[869.76 - 874.56] begin to break the triggers. What that
[872.16 - 876.96] means is that whatever triggered you and
[874.56 - 880.08] is still stuck triggering you and you're
[876.96 - 882.88] still feeling it or the after effects of
[880.08 - 885.76] a trigger, what the twig snapping does
[882.88 - 888.72] is it breaks that trigger. It's a
[885.76 - 890.96] trigger buster. It breaks the trigger.
[888.72 - 894.00] Triggers tend to stick. They don't go
[890.96 - 896.56] away instantly. You can get triggered by
[894.00 - 898.56] something and then it stays there like a
[896.56 - 901.76] stinger from a bee just staying in the
[898.56 - 905.36] wound. So, with each snap of the twig,
[901.76 - 907.68] of the stick, you're snapping a trigger.
[905.36 - 909.76] You're breaking a trigger. Down here in
[907.68 - 913.92] planet Earth, we often get affected by
[909.76 - 916.96] toxic things. Not just toxic substances
[913.92 - 919.76] and exposures that are physical toxins,
[916.96 - 922.44] but emotional toxins from other people,
[919.76 - 925.40] from negativity, from stuff they're
[922.44 - 928.00] exuding, they're projecting, and they're
[925.40 - 931.12] releasing releasing into the air around
[928.00 - 933.60] you, releasing to you, directing it to
[931.12 - 936.24] you. It's a very toxic place for many
[933.60 - 940.48] reasons cuz people are very toxic out
[936.24 - 943.24] there. twig snapping and breaking can
[940.48 - 946.76] shift the triggers that occur from these
[943.24 - 949.44] toxins, these variety of different toxic
[946.76 - 952.80] energies. Spirit of compassion always
[949.44 - 954.36] told me that you could use twig snapping
[952.80 - 956.24] as a means of
[954.36 - 959.92] communication. So, if you're sitting
[956.24 - 962.64] with someone and you're talking to them,
[959.92 - 964.96] you can snap little twigs while you're
[962.64 - 966.80] talking to them. Now, keep in mind, it's
[964.96 - 969.12] not like grabbing big sticks and
[966.80 - 970.48] breaking them while you're with someone
[969.12 - 972.72] or you're sitting there trying to break
[970.48 - 974.00] a big stick on your knee or you got a
[972.72 - 976.48] big stick and you're trying to use all
[974.00 - 978.40] your might to break it or snap it.
[976.48 - 981.60] You're taking these little tiny twigs,
[978.40 - 984.48] sometimes so small and so thin, they
[981.60 - 986.88] break with a very light noise. So you
[984.48 - 989.60] can do it with your thumbnail and go
[986.88 - 991.44] across it every eighth of an inch to a
[989.60 - 993.20] quarter of an inch while you're
[991.44 - 995.04] communicating with someone, while you're
[993.20 - 997.04] talking to someone. And if you're
[995.04 - 998.80] somebody that's really sensitive,
[997.04 - 1001.52] emotionally sensitive, you've been
[998.80 - 1002.96] through a lot, this is a way to keep you
[1001.52 - 1005.44] strong while you're having a
[1002.96 - 1008.08] conversation with someone. This can help
[1005.44 - 1009.68] stop a trigger or a trigger reaction
[1008.08 - 1012.24] while you're listening to what someone
[1009.68 - 1014.24] has to say. If the person that you're
[1012.24 - 1016.24] talking to happens to catch on or
[1014.24 - 1018.48] they're wondering what you're doing or
[1016.24 - 1021.12] they mention it and they see the little
[1018.48 - 1023.20] sticks in your hands or the little twigs
[1021.12 - 1025.92] and they're even hearing them snap cuz
[1023.20 - 1028.80] some could be a little louder. Then hand
[1025.92 - 1032.24] them a bunch of twigs. Have them do it
[1028.80 - 1033.76] too. Offer this technique to them so
[1032.24 - 1036.72] while you're having a conversation with
[1033.76 - 1039.24] them, they're doing it as well. And
[1036.72 - 1042.56] you'll watch how their demeanor
[1039.24 - 1045.44] shifts. Maybe even some angst that they
[1042.56 - 1047.44] have or anguish or something that's
[1045.44 - 1051.20] happening inside of them they can tell
[1047.44 - 1053.44] is coming out. You can watch it shift.
[1051.20 - 1055.60] The communication can change between the
[1053.44 - 1058.80] both of you. So twig snapping can be
[1055.60 - 1060.96] done by yourself but also with others.
[1058.80 - 1063.28] You can use the breaking of these twigs,
[1060.96 - 1067.04] the snapping of them as a communication
[1063.28 - 1069.60] tool, as a communication device.
[1067.04 - 1072.00] Even before talking to someone, letting
[1069.60 - 1074.56] them know what you're doing, preparing
[1072.00 - 1077.00] for a talk, sitting down alone and
[1074.56 - 1079.28] snapping twigs before you meet up with
[1077.00 - 1083.20] someone and you're getting together with
[1079.28 - 1085.36] someone. Or you're with someone and you
[1083.20 - 1087.92] start snapping twigs together before you
[1085.36 - 1090.16] even start communicating or talking.
[1087.92 - 1092.72] Both you and that other person are just
[1090.16 - 1095.36] sitting there together breaking twigs
[1092.72 - 1098.00] and snapping little twigs. Just hearing
[1095.36 - 1100.64] someone else snap a twig with you is
[1098.00 - 1102.40] therapeutic on its own because you know
[1100.64 - 1104.96] lifealtering things are happening to
[1102.40 - 1107.36] them. Frequencies are shifting. They're
[1104.96 - 1109.44] healing in different ways. Their soul is
[1107.36 - 1110.96] receiving the information. If there's
[1109.44 - 1112.64] somebody that's really sensitive,
[1110.96 - 1115.04] they've been through a lot and they get
[1112.64 - 1117.28] triggered easy. Rightfully so. So many
[1115.04 - 1119.20] things happen in our lives. something
[1117.28 - 1122.24] might shift in them as they're breaking
[1119.20 - 1124.04] the twigs, giving you relief because you
[1122.24 - 1126.32] know they may be less
[1124.04 - 1128.72] triggerable. Spirit of compassion always
[1126.32 - 1131.44] told me this is highly extremely
[1128.72 - 1134.08] therapeutic within families when a whole
[1131.44 - 1135.84] family gets together and they sit there
[1134.08 - 1138.40] and they're all snapping little twigs
[1135.84 - 1140.88] together while they're quiet or they're
[1138.40 - 1143.04] thinking or talking in between it. And
[1140.88 - 1144.96] it's even possible to find other people,
[1143.04 - 1147.56] like-minded people that would like to do
[1144.96 - 1150.08] a twig snapping get together or
[1147.56 - 1151.68] gathering where a larger group of people
[1150.08 - 1154.08] get together and they have their piles
[1151.68 - 1156.80] of twigs and everybody's sitting there
[1154.08 - 1158.80] focused, relaxed, and they're breaking
[1156.80 - 1161.60] and snapping little twigs. When your
[1158.80 - 1164.48] mind, body, and soul are being purified
[1161.60 - 1166.72] from the sounds of the twig snapping,
[1164.48 - 1168.16] from these sounds of nature running
[1166.72 - 1170.64] through the body and the consciousness
[1168.16 - 1173.28] and the subconsciousness, the mind, the
[1170.64 - 1177.60] emotional centers of the brain, physical
[1173.28 - 1178.60] brain, the soul. Then words change.
[1177.60 - 1181.40] Different
[1178.60 - 1183.40] phrases, different ways of talking and
[1181.40 - 1185.92] speaking, different lines of
[1183.40 - 1188.76] communication, different thoughts,
[1185.92 - 1191.08] theories can emerge, new
[1188.76 - 1195.28] understandings, new approaches to
[1191.08 - 1198.00] things, spiritual revelations, epiphies,
[1195.28 - 1201.04] and a way to learn about others and talk
[1198.00 - 1203.28] to others and find out things about them
[1201.04 - 1205.92] and yourself that weren't really
[1203.28 - 1208.64] approachable beforehand. Twig snapping
[1205.92 - 1212.76] gettogethers are powerful, more powerful
[1208.64 - 1214.36] than psychedelics, than micro doing than
[1212.76 - 1217.40] iawasa,
[1214.36 - 1220.64] psilocybin, fraud poison. Much more
[1217.40 - 1223.60] safer, much more real and non-damaging
[1220.64 - 1227.36] and non-toxic. And even recording your
[1223.60 - 1230.24] twig snapping, actually recording it and
[1227.36 - 1233.60] playing it back to yourself is powerful
[1230.24 - 1234.96] all on its own. hearing it again, not
[1233.60 - 1236.56] just the first time when it was
[1234.96 - 1238.08] happening in your hands and it was
[1236.56 - 1240.36] vibrating through your body and your
[1238.08 - 1242.56] bones, but also hearing it back on
[1240.36 - 1244.00] recording. So, I'm going to gather up a
[1242.56 - 1246.08] few more twigs right now. I'm picking
[1244.00 - 1248.00] them up off the ground. I found some
[1246.08 - 1250.56] really good ones. I like the way they
[1248.00 - 1253.24] look. I like the way they feel.
[1250.56 - 1256.80] So this time I'm going to direct these
[1253.24 - 1259.28] snaps, these twigs, and breaking them
[1256.80 - 1262.48] and snapping them and directing those
[1259.28 - 1265.92] sounds to my soul. Connecting these
[1262.48 - 1268.88] sounds to the thousands of times through
[1265.92 - 1271.52] my past lives that I've actually heard
[1268.88 - 1274.76] twigs snap and break for all different
[1271.52 - 1278.16] various reasons and different time
[1274.76 - 1280.04] periods. And you can do the same. direct
[1278.16 - 1283.12] these little twig
[1280.04 - 1285.12] snaps to your soul. So, as you grab your
[1283.12 - 1287.48] twig and you're getting ready to break
[1285.12 - 1291.44] it, I'm snapping mine right
[1287.48 - 1294.72] now. Have it directed to your soul.
[1291.44 - 1297.84] Think about how old your soul is. Think
[1294.72 - 1300.80] about all the different lifetimes and
[1297.84 - 1303.44] situations and time periods where you
[1300.80 - 1306.16] were involved with sticks in some way.
[1303.44 - 1308.04] Whether gathering them up for a fire,
[1306.16 - 1311.52] clearing a pathway in the
[1308.04 - 1315.12] woods, throwing a stick to a pet dog
[1311.52 - 1317.44] that you had 400 years ago. Making
[1315.12 - 1318.36] something decorative and carving sticks
[1317.44 - 1320.72] for that
[1318.36 - 1324.40] reason. Walking through the woods and
[1320.72 - 1328.24] the fields, gathering food. gathering
[1324.40 - 1330.00] herbs and berries and foraging and
[1328.24 - 1332.24] stepping on twigs along the way and
[1330.00 - 1335.36] hearing them break and snap. Directing
[1332.24 - 1337.92] the twig snaps to your soul isn't hard
[1335.36 - 1341.36] to do. You don't even have to think
[1337.92 - 1344.88] about it. It could be as simple as these
[1341.36 - 1347.84] are going to my soul and these sounds
[1344.88 - 1350.00] are being received by my soul. Now, the
[1347.84 - 1352.24] speed in which you snap your twigs is up
[1350.00 - 1354.80] to you. It's whatever comes naturally.
[1352.24 - 1356.80] It's whatever feels good. Everybody's
[1354.80 - 1359.44] different, so they're going to handle
[1356.80 - 1362.00] the twigs differently, break the twigs
[1359.44 - 1363.76] differently, snap them. Some are going
[1362.00 - 1366.16] to be faster, some are going to be
[1363.76 - 1368.32] slower. Some days you might change it
[1366.16 - 1371.56] up. I'm going to do it a little quicker
[1368.32 - 1371.56] right now.
[1395.76 - 1398.88] Now, after you're done, you can gather
[1397.28 - 1401.52] up all the little pieces and put them in
[1398.88 - 1403.76] your hand. Or you can leave them about.
[1401.52 - 1406.80] You can scatter them in the yard or the
[1403.76 - 1408.48] field or on your porch where you are.
[1406.80 - 1411.36] You can put them anywhere you want. You
[1408.48 - 1413.68] can save them. can put them in a jar and
[1411.36 - 1415.68] bring them inside the house. I'm gonna
[1413.68 - 1418.80] walk along right now and gather a bunch
[1415.68 - 1422.04] more. When you're doing it alone, it can
[1418.80 - 1425.12] be a sacred experience. A powerful true
[1422.04 - 1428.32] meditation. Clears the mind, lowers the
[1425.12 - 1429.84] stress levels, helps heal the soul. I
[1428.32 - 1432.08] just stumbled across some really nice
[1429.84 - 1434.00] twigs. Now, if you gather twigs with
[1432.08 - 1436.44] someone else, someone you care about, a
[1434.00 - 1439.44] loved one, a friend, a partner,
[1436.44 - 1442.80] companion, maybe somebody you just met,
[1439.44 - 1446.00] it can also be a sacred sacred gathering
[1442.80 - 1449.12] of twigs and a healing experience
[1446.00 - 1452.72] between whoever you're bringing along,
[1449.12 - 1456.00] whoever's with you together. It can be a
[1452.72 - 1458.04] powerful emotional healing technique.
[1456.00 - 1460.88] Just the gathering of the twigs
[1458.04 - 1463.32] themselves. Wow. Just found a whole pile
[1460.88 - 1466.64] right here. So many to choose
[1463.32 - 1468.56] from. Very excited about this. Hope
[1466.64 - 1470.68] you've enjoyed this episode. You can go

[1470.68 - 1475.08] information. You can check out the

[1487.84 - 1491.48] A
[1488.68 - 1495.48] sound. A sound that's
[1491.48 - 1499.32] healing. A sound that your soul
[1495.48 - 1503.12] knows. A sound that your soul
[1499.32 - 1505.44] heard long, long time ago. A thousand
[1503.12 - 1508.56] years ago, you could have been walking
[1505.44 - 1513.20] through the woods, stepping on sticks,
[1508.56 - 1516.40] or gathering twigs for a fire. And maybe
[1513.20 - 1520.00] you were carving a stick to catch a fish
[1516.40 - 1522.56] or making a bow and an arrow. And at
[1520.00 - 1525.20] some point you stepped on a stick and
[1522.56 - 1528.68] you heard it snap. And maybe at some
[1525.20 - 1532.40] point a long time ago you liked the
[1528.68 - 1535.84] sound, the sound of a break, the sound
[1532.40 - 1539.68] of a snap, the sound of a crack. And how
[1535.84 - 1543.52] many times did you walk on a hill using
[1539.68 - 1546.48] a stick and even down a path? Breaking
[1543.52 - 1549.28] sticks is etched in our soul. Snapping
[1546.48 - 1552.04] twigs is etched in our consciousness.
[1549.28 - 1555.08] It's part of who we are from a long time
[1552.04 - 1557.92] ago. Breaking sticks helps us battle the
[1555.08 - 1561.04] hardships. Helps us get through a rough
[1557.92 - 1563.76] ride on a ship. Clears our mind. Brings
[1561.04 - 1566.96] us back in time. And if you're someone
[1563.76 - 1569.92] that feels like you lost yourself a
[1566.96 - 1572.48] while ago, you're not sure who you are
[1569.92 - 1575.36] because it's been that hard. You feel
[1572.48 - 1578.64] like there's a battle on the inside and
[1575.36 - 1580.92] life seems difficult on the outside.
[1578.64 - 1584.32] There's a powerful force between your
[1580.92 - 1588.16] fingertips, a supernatural sound that
[1584.32 - 1591.12] redirects and rewires your soul to help
[1588.16 - 1594.16] keep it round. sitting in the grass and
[1591.12 - 1597.52] holding a twig. You're healing yourself.
[1594.16 - 1600.12] Remember this. Don't forget who you are.
[1597.52 - 1603.76] You're a healing superstar. You're
[1600.12 - 1606.72] strong. You're not subpar. Your soul has
[1603.76 - 1609.76] traveled far. You're more than what you
[1606.72 - 1613.20] think. Much more than what you thought.
[1609.76 - 1616.60] You can heal. It's in your hands. I know
[1613.20 - 1616.60] you understand.

[1694.48 - 1698.00] trendy traps, or gathered bits and
[1696.24 - 1700.00] pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because
[1698.00 - 1701.84] chronic illness is exploding like never
[1700.00 - 1703.76] before in our modern-day history, it
[1701.84 - 1705.60] takes a greater force than us down here.
[1703.76 - 1707.36] It takes a helping hand from above.
[1705.60 - 1708.96] Medical medium information has street
[1707.36 - 1710.24] cred. It's an organic movement of
[1708.96 - 1712.00] countless people around the world
[1710.24 - 1713.76] healing more healing stories of real
[1712.00 - 1715.92] people not being paid to tell their
[1713.76 - 1717.52] life-changing experiences of rising out
[1715.92 - 1719.68] of the ashes of sickness and entering
[1717.52 - 1721.28] into the light of full recovery, getting
[1719.68 - 1722.88] their lives back, and finally healing
[1721.28 - 1724.32] when nothing else in the world of health
[1722.88 - 1726.32] could move the needle and get them
[1724.32 - 1728.72] better. The information on this podcast
[1726.32 - 1730.56] is not man-made. It comes from above,
[1728.72 - 1732.48] from a higher source. Whatever you
[1730.56 - 1734.40] believe in, whether God, the universe,
[1732.48 - 1735.68] the light, or the creator, or if you
[1734.40 - 1737.04] believe in nothing at all, that we're
[1735.68 - 1738.72] just floating through space together on
[1737.04 - 1740.56] this rock, know that the information you
[1738.72 - 1742.32] hear on this podcast is separate from
[1740.56 - 1743.92] all the other noise out there. It comes
[1742.32 - 1746.48] from a different place. A pure
[1743.92 - 1749.52] untampered with advanced clean
[1746.48 - 1753.84] uncorrupted original primary source. A
[1749.52 - 1753.84] higher source, spirit of compassion.
