1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
How many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health? Chances are, whether

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,559
they show it or not, most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,640
in your life do. And chances are, you're

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,800
one of them. Whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,039
anxiety, depression, endometriosis,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,000
acne, eczema, autoimmune, thyroid, lime,

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,320
brain fog, fatigue, or any other symptom

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,480
or condition, you're far from

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,760
alone. Living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,440
the new normal. So, no more guessing

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,840
games. It's time to get answers. Welcome

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,399
Anthony William.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,440
We're talking about healing and spring

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,559
can help with that. Spring has a lot to

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,600
offer when you pay attention and you see

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,120
it for what it's worth. When you feel it

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,600
and you involve yourself in it in any

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,240
capacity, spring can help you heal. It

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,680
can ignite healing. And spring has

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,479
profound rewiring effects. Spring has

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,960
the power to inject metaphysical

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,080
information into the emotional centers

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,520
of the brain. Spring is a mental,

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,000
emotional, and spiritual clearing tool.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,720
So, how do we go about using spring to

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,159
help us heal? And just like the last two

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
spring episodes that you might have

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,880
heard already, we're on to the third.

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,360
It's a medical medium spring series.

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Find yourself a comfortable place out

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,600
there in a yard, in a park, in a field,

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,600
on a porch, and let's do some spring

35
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,280
healing. One of the things I love about

36
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,000
spring is the noises, the

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,640
sounds. Life is coming back. As of now,

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,920
just sitting here, I hear woodpeckers. I

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,560
hear various birds. I hear the wind

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,360
blowing. I hear

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,720
chirping. I hear dogs barking in the

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,920
distance. Everybody's excited about

43
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,239
spring. And what I'm noticing is, I hope

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,800
the same thing you're noticing. I'm

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,520
starting to feel it, hear it, sense it.

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,560
As I'm in it, as I'm sitting in it right

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,239
now, I'm sitting on the grass and I'm

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,840
looking at everything. I'm looking at

49
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,160
bushes, shrubs.

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
I'm looking at brand new leaves. I'm

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,200
looking at the grass that's coming out

52
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,480
of the ground. It looks vibrant. Looks

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,720
alive. It looks fresh. It doesn't look

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,640
wasted and dehydrated. It looks plump.

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,879
It looks vital. I'm looking at the

56
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,840
breeze, how it's going through the

57
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,000
trees, how it's moving leaves

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,480
everywhere, brand new leaves, how it's

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,360
moving the grass, the blades of

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:06,840
grass. I just saw a bird that's flying

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,319
in the wind. I see the wind carrying

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,400
it. It had a stick in its mouth. It

63
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
looks like it's going to make a nest.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm becoming part of spring. on becoming

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,959
one with it. And getting spring to heal

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,519
you, to help you emotionally,

67
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,920
spiritually, mentally, and physically.

68
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,680
To help your body heal is to become one

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,680
with it. It's to become part of it. It's

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,159
to be a part of the spring in it. To use

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,840
spring to heal, you have to see it,

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,720
partake in it. You have to feel it. You

73
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,040
have to smell it. You have to hear it.

74
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,280
And if you can't get outside, that's

75
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,080
okay because you can still sit inside

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,879
the house, crack a window, and hear it

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,159
from there. You can still smell the air

78
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,680
as it enters in through a window or a

79
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,319
doorway. You can still see the grass on

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,040
the ground from a window. And it's still

81
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,879
spring and you're still part of it. And

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,959
that's the point. You just have to be

83
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
part of it. Now, there's a lot of things

84
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,560
you can do in the spring. You can set up

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,159
a garden, start digging, planting seeds.

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
Can take a walk on the beach if you're

87
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
near one. Can take a walk by a lake if

88
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,720
you're near one. You can take a walk

89
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
down a path. You can go ride your

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
bicycle. You can go on a trail in the

91
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
woods. You could go and do a lot of

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,360
things in the spring, but that's keeping

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,120
busy. All those things have healing

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
powers. All those things are good for

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,960
the soul. And someday we'll go through

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,759
each and every one of them. But right

97
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,639
now, it's different. It's about not

98
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,680
doing something. It's about not being

99
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,160
busy. It's about instead seeing the

100
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,840
spring and being a part of it, becoming

101
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,560
it. And not just being busy doing

102
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,199
something spring related, instead

103
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,520
becoming spring for a moment. You can be

104
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,720
busy in your garden. You can be digging

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,600
holes and digging dirt, planting seeds.

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,680
You can be focused on watering those

107
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,720
seeds. But you're actively being busy.

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,759
It's powerful. It's

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,160
healing. But we're talking about

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,360
becoming one with spring. Shutting

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,039
things down for a moment. Sitting there

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,440
listening, smelling the air, focused on

113
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,759
the little things about spring that are

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,520
really huge and they're actually big

115
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,960
things. By not being actively busy while

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,240
you're sitting there and taking in the

117
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,039
spring, you're allowing something to

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,720
happen, a release. You're allowing

119
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,520
emotions to surface because you're not

120
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,400
pushing them down. You're not doing

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,680
something to push them down. You're not

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,240
doing something to keep so busy that you

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,199
can't feel those emotions and that

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,199
everything stays suppressed, stays

125
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,360
depressed. You're allowing an avenue to

126
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,479
open. You're allowing things to surface

127
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:07,160
and sit there so they can leave. You're

128
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:11,800
allowing the toxic emotions, hardships,

129
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,639
experiences, the imprints to surface,

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,479
leave, and

131
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,199
dissipate to get grown over and mulched

132
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,039
up. When you're sitting there with the

133
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,479
spring and you're just listening and

134
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,120
smelling the air and sensing everything

135
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,520
and seeing everything, you're not trying

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,319
to stuff anything down.

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,960
You're not trying to push anything down.

138
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:42,840
Fear and guilt and shame can surface and

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,840
then leave. It can fly away like a

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,080
butterfly. A

141
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,400
butterfly can hedge your

142
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,000
way. And as it's

143
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,840
leaving, so can your fear, guilt, and

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,280
shame, or anything else that's bothering

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,800
you, anything toxic that's inside of

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,160
you, any kind of pain and suffering on

147
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,919
an emotional level, any kind of PTSD,

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,479
see it lift off of you. See it leave you

149
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,479
as you're sitting there

150
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,520
still. See a

151
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:17,560
butterfly take it away as it flies by.

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,319
Springtime is the great

153
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,479
absorber. It absorbs everything.

154
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,840
Everything you see around you is

155
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,800
thriving. It's hungry. It's thirsty. The

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,080
grass is not going dormant. It's not

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,280
dying. Instead, it's thriving and it's

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,800
thirsty. Hungry and it's growing. See

159
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,759
your body like the grass. It's not

160
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,800
dormant. It's not dying. It's thriving.

161
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,840
It's hungry. It's thirsty.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,880
It wants to live. All the leftovers from

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,960
the year, from the winter, from the fall

164
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,319
are being utilized. Nothing is being

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,240
wasted. You have to see your body like

166
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,639
that. All toxins, all toxic emotions,

167
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,120
old imprints, old wounds are being

168
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,479
absorbed. Your body's hungry like the

169
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,120
spring. It's hungry like the grass and

170
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,879
the bushes and the shrubs and the birds

171
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,919
and the butterflies. It eats up all the

172
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,440
waste. It utilizes

173
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,479
everything. As you're sitting there with

174
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,199
spring around you, it's bursting. It's

175
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,759
alive. It's growing over everything that

176
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,560
was old. Just like the old grass and the

177
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,360
old leaves and the old sticks and the

178
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
old herbs are being grown over.

179
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Everything from last year is one step

180
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,039
closer from being absorbed,

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,360
disappearing, dissipating. As you're

182
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,080
sitting there, think about how spring

183
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,800
can do this. And think about how spring

184
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,399
can do this for you. Toxic emotions,

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,120
spiritual confusion, losses, hardships,

186
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,800
any kind of letdowns, betrayal, trust

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,279
wounds, spring is absorbing them a

188
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,040
little bit at a time, bit by bit. Every

189
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,200
single bird chirp, every part of a

190
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,959
breeze, every squirrel that moves, every

191
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,399
leaf that rustles in the wind, every bee

192
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,560
that wakes up and zips by, every

193
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
caterpillar that's walking. There are

194
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,160
sounds everywhere. Some sounds you can

195
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,920
hear and some sounds you can't hear. And

196
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,760
even if you can't hear the sound, it

197
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
doesn't mean it's not working for you.

198
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,120
There is life happening underground.

199
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,880
There are moles moving. There are

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,800
woodchucks and groundhogs. There are

201
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,080
earthworms crawling underneath the soil.

202
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,240
There are bunny rabbits nestled down in

203
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,839
their nest. There are peepers in the

204
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,480
trees. There's toads and frogs in the

205
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:54,640
grass. And there's hawks flying high in

206
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,519
the sky and owls in the trees. All of

207
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,360
this is awakening and moving around you

208
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,080
while you're sitting there. And the

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,959
spring is attaching to the old emotions

210
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,560
that were stuck all winter inside of

211
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:11,120
you, to toxic injuries and wounds that

212
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,600
have resided inside of you. The spring

213
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,880
is consuming it all. Now, if you get a

214
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,600
moment, take a deep

215
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,320
breath. Can you smell the air? Do you

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,640
smell any wild flowers? In the spring,

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,360
there are small wild flowers popping out

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,279
everywhere. With your eyes closed, what

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,040
do you hear?

220
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,279
Are you honing in on any

221
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:39,079
birds, any spring

222
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,079
sounds, any leaves rustling.

223
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,279
Every sound that you hear produced by

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,880
spring is

225
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,880
healing physically, emotionally,

226
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
spiritually,

227
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,560
mentally. Thoughts don't own you. Spring

228
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,200
is in

229
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,000
control. Spring is connected to you.

230
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,399
You're becoming one with

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,399
spring. The healing is occurring right

232
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,399
now.

233
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,279
When you devote your time and energy

234
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,160
into spring, spring sees you and hears

235
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,640
you. The earthly mother spring hears

236
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,000
your

237
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,079
heartbeat. Here's the blood coursing

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,360
through your veins and arteries. Here's

239
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,480
your stomach gurgle and your digestion

240
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,279
process functioning. your eyelids

241
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,279
blinking and even your sinus cavities

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,000
moving. Take a deep

243
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,959
breath. And as you release that breath,

244
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,200
think about you being connected to

245
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:13,480
spring. Spring being connected to you

246
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,480
and all the healing that's occurring.

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,120
Now you can repeat this exercise anytime

248
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,240
out here in spring, out here in your

249
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,519
yard, out here in the park, on a grassy

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,000
null, on a hill, on your porch or inside

251
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,079
your house even. Keep in mind there's

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
different levels of spring, different

253
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,880
phases of spring, different time

254
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,639
periods. There's really early spring,

255
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
there's mid-spring, there's later

256
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,440
spring, and many different phases of

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,920
spring in between those three phases.

258
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,399
Look out for the wild flowers. Take a

259
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,160
close look at them when you see them.

260
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,120
Look out for the first butterflies of

261
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,720
the season. They happen in the spring,

262
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,680
late spring. And look out for the bees

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,600
and the bumblebees, the honeybees. Stare

264
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,839
at them while they're on the flowers.

265
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
Keep in mind that spring changes by the

266
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,079
hour. It changes by the day and by the

267
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,920
week. The sounds are going to be

268
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,600
different. The smells are going to be

269
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,519
different. But there's one thing that's

270
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,200
not

271
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:24,320
different. It's spring always ignites

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,079
healing. Always helps us heal

273
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,880
emotionally, spiritually, physically,

274
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,399
and mentally. When you get a chance, you

275
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,360
can listen to all three of these spring

276
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,360
episodes and repeat them

277
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,079
anytime. For more free information, you

278
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,000

medicalmemedium.com. And please take

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,120
care. Many blessings and God bless

281
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:53,040
you. It's spring. Yes, it is. It's

282
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:57,160
spring. Did you hear that? There's a

283
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,600
bird about to sing. A bee, a wild

284
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,800
flower. It's changing by the hour. A

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,320
butterfly just floated

286
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,639
by. Dear God.

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Dear

288
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:15,120
God, do you think spring's

289
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,360
holy? What would you say to someone who

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,680
thought spring was in their way and

291
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,440
thought spring created nothing but bad

292
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:29,440
days? As I stand here on the lawn, I

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,040
feel like something's under my feet. I

294
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,880
think it was a molly. Oh, mole. Oh, mole

295
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,480
down in the earth. It's springtime. Time

296
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,199
to rebirth. The ground seems sound. All

297
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,399
the birds are all around. Oh god. Oh

298
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,839
god. Do the angels treasure spring? Or

299
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,160
is it something that doesn't mean

300
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,519
anything? And where are the

301
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,079
grasshoppers? Oh, that's right. It's

302
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
spring, not late summer when the

303
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,519
lightning bugs come out at night and

304
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,279
shine so bright. And the grasshoppers

305
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,560
hop all day, hop around. all happy

306
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,880
because spring was their birthday. When

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,920
you involve yourself in spring and take

308
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,480
it all in, a lot of healing can happen

309
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,440
deep within. Angels, angels from above.

310
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,560
Do you soar on the wind? Do you help a

311
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:29,320
spring animal when you can? Do you help

312
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,279
a possum, a raccoon, a bobcat, a fox, a

313
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:35,279
turtle, a bunny? When they get in

314
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:38,000
trouble, do you help them? And when you

315
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:42,120
do, do they think it's funny? When

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,560
spring rain comes our way, the

317
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,560
sunshine comes on another day.

318
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,759
Original published medical medium

319
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
information gets stolen and poached by

320
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,240
podcast doctors, social media doctors,

321
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
influencers, and medical clinics.

322
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
Medical medium information has never yet

323
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
been proven wrong by medical science and

324
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,519
research. Instead, the opposite only

325
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
proven right and then taken from medical

326
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
medium published material and used in

327
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
the conventional and alternative health

328
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
communities. Medical Medium information

329
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
continually sets the stage for medical

330
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
science to understand chronic illness

331
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,560
better. If you choose to share or use

others who see and learn of this

337

information have a chance to know where

338
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
it all originates to give them an

339
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
opportunity to heal so they don't end up

340
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,320
losing years of their life searching for

341
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,160
answers like so many have before them.

342
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
The medical medium information here on

343
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
this podcast doesn't come from broken

344
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,079
science, interest groups, medical

345
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
funding with strings attached, botched

346
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,880
research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,

347
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,959
persuaded belief systems, private panels

348
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
of influencers, health field payoffs,

349
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,480
trendy traps, or gathered bits and

350
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,400
pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because

351
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,319
chronic illness is exploding like never

352
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
before in our modern-day history, it

353
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,000
takes a greater force than us down here.

354
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,760
It takes a helping hand from above.

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,439
Medical medium information has street

356
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
cred. It's an organic movement of

357
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,400
countless people around the world

358
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
healing more healing stories of real

359
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
people not being paid to tell their

360
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,000
life-changing experiences of rising out

361
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,080
of the ashes of sickness and entering

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,679
into the light of full recovery, getting

363
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
their lives back and finally healing

364
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
when nothing else in the world of health

365
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,720
could move the needle and get them

366
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,120
better. The information on this podcast

367
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
is not man-made. It comes from above,

368
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,880
from a higher source. Whatever you

369
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,799
believe in, whether God, the universe,

370
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
the light, or the creator, or if you

371
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
believe in nothing at all, that we're

372
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
just floating through space together on

373
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,960
this rock, know that the information you

374
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,720
hear on this podcast is separate from

375
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
all the other noise out there. It comes

376
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,880
from a different place. A pure

377
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,919
untampered with advanced clean

378
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,240
uncorrupted original primary source. A

379
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,240
higher source, spirit of compassion.
