be just doing some

33
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,520
work on that um this is an important

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,600
important live right now because

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,439
i never really clarified what's

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,240
happening with epstein barr

37
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
everybody has it it leads to just all

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
kinds of problems it leads to weight

39
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
gain

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
weight gain you've got millions of

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
people on the planet

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,640
millions and millions of people right

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
having weight issues

44
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
and they're having these weight issues

45
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,439
because they got the low

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,560
grade epstein bar year after year

47
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,840
living inside the liver churning and

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,600
turning and producing by product

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,520
by-product so important to know

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,759
and that's what happens the epstein-barr

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
creates all this byproduct inside the

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,040
liver

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,640
and then we get in trouble because all

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,600
of a sudden the liver gets stagnant and

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119

life at one point any kind of vertigo

195
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,240
any kind of body pain unexplainable your

196
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,319
knees bother you a little bit but really

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,599
there's no real good reason

198
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,160
how about that okay and pcos

199
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,080
like i said and endometriosis

200
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,400
infertility epstein-barr

201
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
mystery infertility not like you don't

202
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,599
have a clog

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
fallopian tube like mystery so that's

204
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,960
important to know okay

205
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,440
so keep that in mind um

206
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,759
let's go a little bit with this so we're

207
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,080
at a place in time where the majority of

208
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,800
the world's population is living

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,720
with one or more of many mutations of

210
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
the epstein-barr virus

211
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,880
epstein-barr is responsible for symptoms

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,039
conditions diseases

213
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,080
disorders and illnesses of every

214
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,840
category

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
for some people it creates fatigue and

216
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,800
pain that get targeted

217
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,599
tagged as lyme disease or go unnamed

218
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,360
for others epstein-barr symptoms prompts

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,440
doctors to prescribe ineffective

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,360
treatments such as hormone replacement

221
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,479
a lot of times that i've seen bar you

222
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
know everybody's told it's their

223
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,000
hormones

224
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,599
it's their hormones right no that's

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
those symptoms are your hormones

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,599
that fatigue that's your hormones those

227
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
aches and pains that's your hormones

228
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,840
right

229
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,199
those migraines that's your hormones

230
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,960
like but we got the

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,720
bar instead that's how it works um

232
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,199
so a lot of people are walking around

233
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
with ebv and they get misdiagnosed

234
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
are you one of them among the reasons

235
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
ebv is thriving so little is understood

236
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,039
about it

237
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
actually the only thing understood about

238
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,840
epstein-barr out there in research in

239
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,279
science was taken from

240
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,680
medical medium book one

241
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,440
that's right before medical medium book

242
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,800
one epstein-barr was just

243
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,680
mono and mono went away you get mono

244
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,159
you're sick it went away that's it so if

245
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,160
you're

246
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,080
a patient and you're sitting here you

247
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,839
get a call from the doctor's office

248
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:56,000
you're like hello oh hi

249
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,120
i got mononucleosis that's what i have

250
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,279
that's why i got the swollen glands and

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,839
i can't swallow good

252
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,560
and that's why i had the fever and the

253
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,240
listlessness and malaise

254
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,680
so i got mono how do you like that

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,120
what after it goes away i'll never see

256
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
it again

257
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
no problems either and never a symptom

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
ever in my life

259
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,240
okay well that's what research in

260
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,080
science says now right and that's what

261
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,760
you say there at the doctor's office i'm

262
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,320
never going to see a symptom

263
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
mono is just mono is that the

264
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,519
epstein-barr virus

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,519
it is and all it does is give you mono

266
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
okay and then the publication of the

267
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
medical medium book

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,399
has determined epstein-barr to be the

269
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
culprit of a whole bunch of diseases

270
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
symptoms conditions and research and

271
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,839
science plagiarized

272
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,000
and you know what you know it's uncool

273
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,519
because they have to legally

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
cite where it comes from and because of

275
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,240
discrimination because of my source they

276
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
feel like they don't have to but that's

277
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,959
not true they actually have to cite it

278
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,760
and so that's important to know for the

279
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,000
future by the way

280
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,079
um let's talk about this so anyway

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
among the reasons it's thriving because

282
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,680
very little is

283
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,120
understood medical research and science

284
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,000
are only aware of

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
one version of epstein-barr okay get

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
this

287
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,200
right one version of epstein barr

288
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,200
and then medical medium is over 60

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,480
varieties of epstein-barr

290
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
okay now there's a little

291
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,680
little thing going on with research and

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,800
science where they think there might be

293
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,519
two stealing information once again

294
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,760
theresa i'm one week into drinking heavy

295
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
metal detox smoothie daily and switch to

296
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,399
vimergy b12

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,560
wow what an improvement um

298
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,760
it's important for anybody who needs to

299
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,360
know this stuff i've been saying this

300
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,720
for a long time b12 is not b12

301
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,079
b12 is not b12 it's not okay

302
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,920
there's b12 and then there's b12

303
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,079
and there's a big difference it's make

304
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,920
or break to how to heal

305
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,680
um from what i've experienced with

306
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
friends and family

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,360
is there's a massive difference with the

308
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
vimergy b12

309
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
massive difference so if anybody wants

310
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,040
to know that's v's and victor i

311
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:24,000
am as mary e rgy.com i'm not sponsored

312
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,880
but here's the deal the deal is i want

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,959
people better

314
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
and i like people getting better and i

315
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,920
care about people getting

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
better and i notice that with friends

317
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
and families and

318
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
and you know that i've known personally

319
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,360
in my life and i say no no no that's not

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,040
the right b12 switch it to b12 and all

321
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,640
of a sudden they're moving forward it

322
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
makes a big difference

323
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
these are tools though these are tools

324
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
that's what it's about

325
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,320
april says what book is this the new

today i saw you chodes

334
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,519
she's on today they're mutating 60

335
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,040
varieties of epstein barr

336
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,560
you guys just came out of making banana

337
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,760
lettuce boats

338
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
but we're just talking about a little

339
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,760
epstein-barr for the moment

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,480
epstein-barr is behind several of the

341
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,880
debilitating illnesses that stump

342
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,720
doctors that stump doctors

343
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
as i said in the introduction it's the

344
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,279
mystery illness of

345
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,360
mystery illnesses it's what epstein-barr

346
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
is still is today even though they've

347
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
taken medical medium information and now

348
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
they

349
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
test for epstein-barr every time they

350
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,959
test for lyme disease

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,920
i had my lyme disease test and i got my

352
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,600
epstein-barr test

353
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,839
this phone's getting out of control now

354
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,800
okay what

355
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,560
i thought you tested me for lyme disease

356
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,160
you tested me for epstein-barr at the

357
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,519
same time as you tested me for lyme

358
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,760
disease

359
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,880
how come i thought i was looking for

360
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,279
like a lime

361
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,480
test because i thought i had lyme

362
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,440
disease

363
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
but you tested for epstein-barr too why

364
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
would you do that

365
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
because of anthony william and that's

366
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,320
what happens now

367
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
the world's changing they're testing for

368
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,120
epstein-barr

369
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,519
and then let's go a little bit more here

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,079
into it medical research and science

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
have no

372
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,920
idea how the virus operates long-term

373
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,839
they just thought it gave you mono

374
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,480
that's all they thought

375
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,320
yeah they didn't know how problematic it

376
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
could be the truth is epstein-barr

377
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
is the source of numerous health

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,639
problems i just talked about that

379
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,440
fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome

380
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,160
ebv is also the cause of some major

381
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,839
maladies that medical communities think

382
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,959
they understand but really

383
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,920
don't including thyroid disease lupus

384
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
vertigo tinnitus so that's what we're

385
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,120
doing we're talking about epstein-barr

386
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,920
right here

387
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,279
so um you guys it's so great i'm gonna

388
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,480
make banana lettuce boats in a little

389
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,160
bit

390
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
so take it from there

391
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,560
um we're in epstein bar right now

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,040
talking about the different sections in

393
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,040
here too

394
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:19,040
all right

395
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,440
would i've seen bar be responsible for

396
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,720
swollen lymph nodes bumps on one side of

397
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
the neck

398
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,639
and i've taught this to doctors for

399
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,680
years okay that's what epstein-barr does

400
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
it swells up

401
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,000
lymph nodes that's a big thing

402
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,120
epstein-barr does so it's a lymph node

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,839
sweller for sure and that's that's how

404
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,600
ebb works

405
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,680
until the publication is booked those

406
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,519
with ebv would typically be stuck with

407
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,760
it for the rest of their lives doctors

408
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,680
are starting to accept and learn from

409
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
the information released here that have

410
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
seen bar

411
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,360
is the root cause of problems in the

412
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,199
past they believe the most trouble

413
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,720
epstein-barr caused for a patient was

414
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,079
mild fatigue and malaise that's it

415
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,120
that's it possible fever now some

416
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
doctors are in the

417
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
infancy stage of recognizing and

418
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
addressing the epstein-barr virus due to

419
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,639
the medical meaning

420
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,000
information public published so it's

421
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,360
very interesting there okay

422
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
so let's talk about the different stages

423
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,320
i want to give you guys a rundown

424
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,600
first stage epson bar is you contract it

425
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,720
you're in a restaurant

426
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,440
okay so you're in a restaurant

427
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
well i just got a nice piece of bread

428
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
here with butter on it

429
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
in the restaurant here and i didn't know

430
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,519
the chef

431
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,639
a little spittle came out of the chef's

432
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
mouth right

433
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
he was yelling at the other chef the

434
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,680
sous chef

435
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,199
and he was making the but he was getting

436
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
the butter and he was making the bread

437
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
and

438
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,519
no one knew that he was yelling at the

439
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
guy next to him and spit was flying out

440
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
of his mouth while he was back there in

441
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,519
the kitchen

442
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,560
and that spit landed on that bread and

443
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:57,199
butter and i ate that bread and butter

444
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,440
and now i just contracted epstein-barr

445
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,680
that's as easy as it gets like it's

446
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
simple and quick and easy like that

447
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,839
you can catch it like that so easy and

448
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
that's how it works

449
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,120
um kissing

450
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,399
it's another one duh right relationships

451
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,079
it's another one

452
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,480
public bathrooms it's another one

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,519
sipping off of people's water

454
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,199
yeah i'll take that i'll you just had a

455
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
sip i'll take a step too you just had a

456
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
sip

457
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
i'll take a sip too so it's like that

458
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,680
right double

459
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,560
dipping so i'm just gonna stick my

460
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,000
cheese

461
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,040
my cheese stick in this sauce right here

462
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,759
i'm at a party i'm gonna take a bite put

463
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,360
it back in

464
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,279
double dip boom epstein bar

465
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
it's how it's done it's how it always

466
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,720
was done

467
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,160
and epstein bar goes through stages

468
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
that's the first stage now you got it

469
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
floating around in your body

470
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,519
it's floating around floating around

471
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,040
it's floating around

472
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,199
okay and eventually

473
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,240
it's only floating around a little bit

474
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
okay

475
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
it could be anywhere in the body

476
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,079
floating around

477
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
in the bloodstream but not a lot of it

478
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,160
not a lot of it

479
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,439
not a lot of it at all okay but it's

480
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,199
floating around

481
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,720
and then it eats something it likes so

482
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
it's in your bloodstream and it has

483
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
something it likes to eat so let's go

484
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,480
into a few things

485
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,000
it likes to eat something so now it's

486
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,880
eating

487
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,919
an egg so you eat your eggs you like

488
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
your eggs

489
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
i like this hard-boiled egg you know i

490
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,120
like to or i like this one minute boiled

491
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
egg right

492
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
you eat your egg you enjoy it fried eggs

493
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,840
whatever scrambled eggs

494
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,520
and then when you eat the food the virus

495
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
eats the food

496
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,679
that's finding its way into your

497
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,799
bloodstream that's how it works

498
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:52,000
the virus then all of a sudden does this

499
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,600
okay does this and all of a sudden the

500
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,160
virus goes like that

501
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,160
there's two

502
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,000
right three

503
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,039
and now four then five

504
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,480
then six now you got a bunch of these

505
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,600
swimming around in your body

506
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,039
now your immune system

507
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,960
gets wise and

508
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
so your immune system is just doing its

509
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,520
thing floating around in your

510
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,880
bloodstream

511
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,320
and then it comes across one of them

512
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
and then the war pursues

513
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
and that's coming in to stage two

514
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,200
so that's how the process works i want

515
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
to talk about that in a minute

516
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,760
so stage one is it's just floating

517
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,039
around your system

518
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,039
you contracted it it's there's going to

519
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,640
be time and it waits for your immune

520
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
system to drop too

521
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,679
so it waits for your immune system to

522
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
drop as

523
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,640
it's producing so it's getting stronger

524
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,120
by eating eggs

525
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
it's getting stronger by eating cheese

526
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,120
that's what it's doing

527
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
it's in our body it's eating food okay

528
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,000
that's stage one

529
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,240
and then stage two is the war

530
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
and that's stage two that's stage two is

531
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,760
the war against

532
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,679
the epstein bar and your immune system

533
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
but the immune system usually weakens

534
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,880
before

535
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,120
it makes its break and that's how it

536
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
works too so you get stressed out maybe

537
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
betrayal

538
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,160
broken trust maybe you're totally just

539
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,400
your adrenals are compromised

540
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
because you're so jacked up on caffeine

541
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
your immune system lowers because of

542
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
that

543
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,080
other problems too clones perfumes

544
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,679
concentric candles air fresheners lower

545
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,440
your immune system

546
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,080
but why does it affect some and not

547
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
others depends what you got going on

548
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
how many toxic heavy metals do you have

549
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
in your system how much stress are you

550
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
under are you under financial stress are

551
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,400
you

552
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,720
did you go through a divorce everybody

553
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,679
has these different immune system

554
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
busting complications are you eating

555
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,880
more

556
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,640
eggs than somebody else what variety of

557
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,360
epstein-barr did you contract

558
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,200
there's over 60 varieties and growing so

559
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,120
which variety of epson bar did you

560
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,960
contract that right there is a big one

561
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,039
too is it a more aggressive one

562
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,799
like the ones going around now which are

563
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,440
much much more aggressive

564
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,080
or is it one of the old-school varieties

565
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,919
they sit in the body for a long time

566
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
and you don't hear from them until

567
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,440
you're 49 years old

568
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
and then now you got the weight gain and

569
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,880
the fatigue i've been eating whatever i

570
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,039
want my whole life

571
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
i've been skinny my whole life my

572
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,880
friends they they're always jealous

573
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,880
because i've been thin my whole life and

574
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
then all of a sudden you're 49 years old

575
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
it's like why is this weight coming on

576
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,640
why am i getting heart palpitations why

577
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,559
am i getting hot flashes

578
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,000
you might have the old school kind and

579
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,440
now you go to the doctor and they're

580
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
saying you're hypothyroid

581
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,840
it's the old school one so what happens

582
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,240
is it's different for each person

583
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,880
stage two is the war and the war is

584
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
your immune system with the epstein barr

585
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,919
so that's stage two

586
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,919
so we'll go into that a little bit

587
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,559
at the end of stage one the epstein-barr

588
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,919
virus becomes willing to

589
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,600
challenge your immune system in battle

590
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,600
that's when epstein-barr first makes its

591
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
presence known by turning into what

592
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,159
doctors call mononucleosis that's the

593
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,919
war

594
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,000
that's when it's now mono you might not

595
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,320
feel your motto you might not feel

596
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
it it might not even be an aggressive

597
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
variety

598
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
you might not have a lot of stressors in

599
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,559
your life

600
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,559
and somebody else they got more of an

601
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,720
aggressive strain of fc bar and that

602
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,880
mono hits them really hard

603
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,280
really really hard so that's important

604
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,880
there too to know

605
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,039
so and then what happens when that war

606
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,440
happens and you get the mononucleosis

607
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,120
your immune system eventually starts to

608
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,039
win the war and that's when your immune

609
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
system starts to beat out that epstein

610
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,520
bar and winning the war and winning the

611
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
war

612
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,280
then what's left of that epstein bar

613
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,480
because it knows

614
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,520
it's been defeated it makes a run for

615
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,200
your organs and it ends up making a run

616
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,320
for the liver

617
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,480
spleen and reproductive system

618
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,919
okay a lot of times it might be the

619
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,280
liver

620
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,120
some women it might be the liver and

621
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
reproductive system and then it goes in

622
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,880
there and it goes

623
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,919
dormant your doctor says your motto is

624
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,559
over

625
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
and now you're free you're free to live

626
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,919
your life

627
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,039
your motto is gone nothing to worry

628
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,080
about it

629
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:28,799
and that is how it goes so

630
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,559
go into this a little bit it's during

631
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,039
this stage the epstein-barr seeks a

632
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,400
long-term home by making a run for one

633
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,960
or more of your major

634
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,159
organs typically your liver spleen

635
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,520
reproductive system

636
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
organs ebv loves being in these organs

637
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,080
because of mercury

638
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,320
dioxins other toxins residues from foods

639
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,240
such as eggs dairy products and gluten

640
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
are likely to accumulate here

641
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,280
the virus thrives on these poisons which

642
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,440
could eventually lead to endometriosis

643
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,159
fibroids pcos ovarian cysts prostate

644
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
issues

645
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,760
mystery infertility so that's how it

646
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,039
works

647
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
um so now the epstein bar is just

648
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,440
camping out

649
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,360
and so it's camping out so then we go

650
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,960
into the next stage

651
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,799
right your immune system drops again

652
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,240
it drops how does it drop

653
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,320
and it could have dropped even from this

654
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,960
before the blood draw

655
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,360
that's how it drops that's a big one

656
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
that

657
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,440
leads to more problems i mean this

658
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
blood draw okay will drop it at any time

659
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,000
it'll drop it at any time during your

660
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
stage

661
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
one two three four of epson bar it'll

662
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,880
drop it in all kinds of situations

663
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
it can drop it and then you contract it

664
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,679
easier it can drop it and then

665
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
you actually go into that mononucleosis

666
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
easier i mean but

667
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
at this phase especially at this phase

668
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,559
this is when

669
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,720
you're getting routine blood tests you

670
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,360
know you're doing your thing in life

671
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,559
and boom it's it's when it's happening

672
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
if you guys haven't listened to the

673
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,600
episode

674
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
definitely here you know listen when you

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,080
can alright so you can listen medical

676
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
mean podcast at apple podcast link is in

677
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,679
the description

678
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,279
it's the blood draw bloodletting um

679
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,720
vampirism episode

680
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,360
okay so that's where the blood draw

681
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,400
problem really sets sets in so let's go

682
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,480
into epstein-barr

683
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,640
stage three once the virus settles into

684
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
your liver spleen or reproductive system

685
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,760
organs it nests there

686
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,120
it's nesting so then you live your life

687
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,039
you live your life you're doing your

688
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,159
thing no big deal

689
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,279
life is back to normal all is well it's

690
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,279
nesting in there right

691
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:48,480
so now the upstairs

692
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,320
guys now the epstein-barr virus is

693
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,000
nesting inside your liver

694
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,159
that's where it is props are getting out

695
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
of hand right so much

696
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
so the epstein bar is sitting inside the

697
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
liver

698
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,679
it's sitting inside the reproductive

699
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,200
system too

700
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,039
whether you're pregnant or not

701
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
it's sitting inside the reproductive

702
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,480
system okay

703
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,919
it can sit inside the prostate

704
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,760
in men but the liver is the big one

705
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,120
reproductive system is the second

706
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,080
biggest place

707
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,720
all right it can sit inside the spleen

708
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,919
so

709
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,120
and that's what it does all right

710
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,440
okay so you guys now

711
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,480
as that virus is nesting i gotta make

712
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,480
the banana boats

713
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,720
this is what i gotta do we gotta get

714
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,559
through that

715
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
from this point on when a doctor tests

716
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,320
for epstein-barr she or he

717
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
will most likely find antibodies and

718
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,520
take these to indicate

719
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,960
a past infection that was in the past

720
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,320
that was in the past okay

721
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,440
well uh oh yeah i'm here

722
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,760
what is it i had epstein barr

723
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,000
so you're saying i had epstein barr you

724
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,720
found antibodies

725
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,559
that showed i had epstein-barr but

726
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,559
that's not the problem

727
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,679
so i don't have epstein-barr now you're

728
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,360
saying

729
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,360
you're saying that epstein-barr is only

730
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,400
the mono i had and i'm showing an

731
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,240
antibody

732
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,159
but that's not why i got this tingles

733
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,440
and numbness on my shoulder

734
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,080
and my my my back and that's not why my

735
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,000
fingers feel like numb and i they turn

736
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,919
purple all the time

737
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,679
and that's not like that's not why i

738
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,720
have any of that it's not what

739
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,440
okay okay okay so i have the antibody

740
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,559
though

741
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,600
they're wrong

742
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,039
this is something that's been messed up

743
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,320
in our system for a very long time

744
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,919
they're completely wrong

745
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
and that's the difference medical media

746
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
information brought this to the world

747
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,640
that's why people are healing

748
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,679
because you still got the epstein barr

749
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,240
so the doctor finds the antibodies and

750
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,279
take these to indicate a past infection

751
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,159
when epstein-barr was in its mono phase

752
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,000
the doctor will not find the epstein bar

753
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,200
presently active anymore

754
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,200
because that was when it was in its

755
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,880
monophase right so that's what's going

756
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,520
on there

757
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
okay important enough the confusion here

758
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
is one of the biggest blunders in the

759
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,000
medical hit in medical

760
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
history this is how this virus has

761
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
slipped through the cracks

762
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,960
because the doctors don't believe you

763
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,760
have epstein-barr

764
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,720
even with the antibody they find and

765
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,000
even then

766
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
it doesn't mean they're going to find an

767
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
antibody either different varieties of

768
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,960
epstein-barr elude blood tests which is

769
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,120
a whole other thing you guys

770
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,200
okay and so that's another thing unless

771
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,679
you have already followed the measures

772
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,919
outlined in this new edition

773
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,120
in this book to kill the epstein-barr

774
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,200
virus

775
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,440
in fact it's still alive and causing new

776
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,360
symptoms and it eludes the tests that's

777
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,039
because it's living in the liver like i

778
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,320
was showing you guys

779
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,600
it's living there in the liver and

780
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,120
spleen reproductive system and the test

781
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
to detect this has not

782
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,520
yet been invented so they have not

783
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,880
invented a test

784
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,559
to know where the virus is we're so

785
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
behind with chronic illness like

786
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,039
decades behind i mean a hundred years

787
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,159
from now and people are

788
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
a hundred years from now people are

789
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,039
going to read they're going to be

790
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,919
dusting off these medical medium books

791
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,039
i'll be gone all right i'll be gone all

792
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,799
right

793
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,600
and if the world didn't blow up from

794
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,320
nuclear bombs

795
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,360
or anything else they're gonna dust off

796
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,039
these books

797
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,679
and they're gonna be like hey did you

798
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,679
know this guy

799
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,320
hey did you know this guy knew

800
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,039
wait a minute he's saying the virus is

801
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
still in us

802
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,640
did we did we come up with a way of

803
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,360
figuring it out that it's still in the

804
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,799
liver

805
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,159
we haven't 100 years later

806
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,840
but wait a minute did you hear about

807
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
that new green tea study

808
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,679
they'll be working on the next green tea

809
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,360
study 100 years from now

810
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,440
and not figuring out what's going on all

811
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,600
right

812
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,559
with the virus hiding undetected in your

813
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,960
organs

814
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,279
your body assumes it's won the war and

815
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,360
the invader has been destroyed

816
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,559
your immune system returns to its normal

817
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,399
state your mononucleosis ends

818
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,559
and your doctor tells you that you're

819
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,120
healthy unfortunately the epstein-barr

820
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,240
virus has barely begun its voyage

821
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,640
hence you guys probably know about this

822
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
eggs and pains balance issues vertigo

823
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,240
tinnitus

824
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,960
tingles and numbness burning skin pain

825
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,000
in the neck

826
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,520
back legs knee issues plantar fasciitis

827
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,720
right mourns neuroma how about that one

828
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,559
you know all of these pots okay

829
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,640
reynolds lupus cfs eczema

830
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,600
just epstein-barr is involved in there

831
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
all the i'm just at pcos

832
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,760
endometriosis did you have anything like

833
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,039
that fibroids

834
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,720
epstein-barr if you have a typical

835
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,159
variety of steam bar could lie dormant

836
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,799
in your organs for years that's why

837
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
you'll say

838
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,919
like i read the comment earlier it's

839
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,840
like how come it doesn't happen to these

840
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,720
other people but it happens to

841
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,799
it happens to these other people so

842
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
typically it can hide for decades

843
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,679
without you knowing it especially if

844
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,520
your immune system hasn't

845
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,880
been weakened but you keep on getting

846
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,000
the blood draws and here's the problem

847
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,919
you might be somebody that doesn't even

848
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,840
get a blood blood test

849
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,200
i've known people they go 10 years 15

850
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,960
years they don't even get a blood test

851
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,039
right the minute they started getting

852
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
sick they're getting the blood drawn

853
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,760
from them all the time that's why you

854
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,520
have to listen to the the

855
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,279
medical mean podcast at apple podcast

856
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
the blood draw episode you've got to

857
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,399
listen

858
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,600
you guys i'm just i know some many of

859
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,399
you guys listened

860
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,799
but so many haven't you gotta listen to

861
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,000
that

862
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,000
it's important to know so um

863
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,000
so let's talk about the blood they take

864
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,080
in this situation

865
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,399
so i'm just gonna grab my tomato sauce

866
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,000
jar for a second if you guys don't mind

867
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,320
and i'm gonna do a little blood

868
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,480
extraction right here

869
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,480
okay now they take a lot of blood from

870
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,120
everybody

871
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,360
that's real blood in there no it's not

872
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,519
strained tomatoes right

873
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,720
they take a lot of blood from everybody

874
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,480
is what they do

875
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,480
so important to know

876
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,000
and your immune system could stay strong

877
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,760
and your epstein-barr isn't causing a

878
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,279
problem yet it's dormant

879
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,120
inside the liver okay and you're

880
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,120
you're not challenged either maybe

881
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,799
you're not exposed to enough pesticides

882
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,919
herbicides fungicides

883
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,000
maybe you're somebody that doesn't have

884
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,039
the air fresheners in their home maybe

885
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
you're not under stress

886
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,559
maybe you didn't have that divorce maybe

887
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,960
you know

888
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,760
financial problems aren't there whatever

889
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,000
it is

890
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,399
you don't have enough triggers you know

891
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,919
you haven't been triggered enough right

892
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,000
and you got kind of a docile

893
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,080
epstein-barr variety it's not

894
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,600
a real aggressive one so all that's

895
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,279
happening and then

896
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,960
what happens is whether you start

897
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
getting your first symptoms to begin

898
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,200
with

899
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,799
happens to everybody maybe they're

900
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,120
getting hormone tested because they got

901
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,200
the hot flashes their heart palpitations

902
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,559
maybe they don't feel good maybe they

903
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
just want to check up they're gaining

904
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,039
some weight

905
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,399
and they get all that blood taken so now

906
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,720
they get 70

907
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,880
milliliters of blood 100 milliliters of

908
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
blood 140 milliliters of blood taken

909
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,240
from them

910
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,760
and with that taken from them it's

911
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,279
dropping their immune system so they get

912
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,120
all this blood taken for them

913
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,640
from them when they get their blood test

914
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,720
and their white counts in there

915
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,640
their red blood cells are in there and

916
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,840
they're losing this

917
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,799
and then epstein barr is in the organs

918
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,480
okay and creeping up they'll say that

919
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,880
you'll replenish your blood perfectly

920
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
fine

921
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,720
perfectly quick perfectly easy it's not

922
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
how it works

923
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,080
it takes a long time sometimes three to

924
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
six months to get your immune system

925
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,840
back up to par

926
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,679
red blood cells and white white count

927
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,760
cbc your complete blood count

928
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,440
takes time and anybody who's got

929
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,519
symptoms they're already dealing with

930
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,720
the weakened immune system to begin with

931
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,320
so that's important enough

932
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,399
now they take all this blood and they

933
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,760
say they need it you know and this

934
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,080
this is your sum of the blood they'll

935
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,120
take three times that they'll take four

936
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,440
times that

937
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,240
that's the other thing too you'll get

938
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,519
six vial seven vials ten vials and then

939
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
if you're sick for a little while you

940
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,480
got to go to the specialist because now

941
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,159
you got to look for another doctor

942
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,320
specialist doesn't care if you had blood

943
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,320
test blood work done two weeks ago

944
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,000
they want another 28 vials and this

945
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,200
happens to a lot of people it may not be

946
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,240
happening to you

947
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,240
but it's totally wasted a lot of people

948
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,039
that's why this is so critical right

949
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,760
all they need to do this is all they

950
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,120
need for blood tests this is it okay

951
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,760
um so let's do a little bit of this

952
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,360
they just need this much so i'm going to

953
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,720
put a little drop on here

954
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,279
they only need that much i don't know if

955
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,159
you can see that

956
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,159
is that too bright

957
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,280
all right this is a very runny

958
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,200
a very runny sauce for some reason it's

959
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,000
not doing what it needs to do

960
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,919
so you see that blood drop right there

961
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,560
they only need that much

962
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,480
that's all they need less than that exac

963
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,359
absolutely less than that just for one

964
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,399
test

965
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,720
two tests three tests you can get three

966
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,119
four

967
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,119
five tests out of that get your

968
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,200
metabolic panel your thyroid panel

969
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,119
you can get um you know your cbc count

970
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,480
you can get your cholesterol done you

971
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
can get your a

972
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,040
a anti-nuclear antigen test you can get

973
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,679
your cbc reactive protein test

974
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,399
you can get your deficiency vitamin

975
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,440
mineral deficiency tests right

976
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,040

listen chrissy said

983
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,839
if they only need a small amount then

984
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,839
why do they take so much

985
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,920
because something's terribly wrong

986
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,079
that's why the system's broken

987
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,680
they don't want to fix it nobody wants

988
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,040
to admit they've been taking too much

989
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,240
it's like you're in it too

990
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,280
deep what do you do right you're in it

991
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,680
too deep

992
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,960
what do you do you got the entire

993
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,880
medical system

994
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,240
robbing and stealing and thefting

995
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,160
people's blood

996
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,079
knocking their immune system down

997
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,160
killing them

998
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,200
if they got diseases like cancer

999
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,680
quickening

1000
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,440
uh and quickening their life as far as

1001
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,800
their lifespan to a bad

1002
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,079
place right deficiencies rampant

1003
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,400
creating rampant deficiencies removing

1004
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,560
white count all the time your bone

1005
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,560
marrow has to go into overload

1006
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,599
okay why are they doing it when you're

1007
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
in it too deep

1008
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,720
they're not going to make an

1009
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,079
announcement and say

1010
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,359
we messed up it's not

1011
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
good because then everybody's going to

1012
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,880
question it everybody every good

1013
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,599
scientist is going to question it all of

1014
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,680
a sudden like

1015
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,800
wait a minute what do you mean you

1016
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
messed up

1017
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,839
like so that's what's going to happen

1018
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,359
now so all of a sudden every single

1019
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,560
scientist is going to get a phone call

1020
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,800
they're like

1021
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,400
what what do you need what do you mean

1022
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,040
we screwed up

1023
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,920
you mean we've been taking everybody's

1024
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,000
blood and removing their immune system

1025
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,359
people with cancer are dying really

1026
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
quick because of it because they have no

1027
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,359
immune system

1028
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,119
left because they're getting their blood

1029
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,720
drawn every week

1030
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,160
two weeks three weeks um we're taking

1031
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,240
blood out of pregnant women

1032
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,920
you mean that was affecting babies

1033
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,640
because we're taking eight vials of

1034
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,359
blood

1035
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,079
out of pregnant women wait so all this

1036
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,520
is wrong

1037
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,640
what are you talking about it's all

1038
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,599
wrong what do we do and just you can't

1039
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,079
you know you can't how many lawsuits you

1040
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,400
know

1041
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,200
who's gonna get sued who made the big

1042
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,000
mistake

1043
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,040
listen to the podcast so link is in the

1044
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,880
description

1045
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,320
medical meeting podcast at apple podcast

1046
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,920
that's the place to listen to it that's

1047
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,960
the uncensored version

1048
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,240
so you only need this much that's it but

1049
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
they take

1050
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,280
exorbitant amount of blood from people

1051
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,280
and that's the next thing too so

1052
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,359
but where does that lead us to take this

1053
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
much blood where does it lead us

1054
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,280
it leads us in a bad place we lose our

1055
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,440
immune systems

1056
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,760
so back to the symptoms we'll head there

1057
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,440
a little bit

1058
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,880
so now the virus okay in stage three

1059
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,640
we're talking about

1060
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,480
the virus because we get our immune

1061
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,880
system lowers we're getting the blood

1062
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,040
taken from us we're getting blood draws

1063
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,480
it doesn't have to hit us a week after

1064
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,119
we get the blood draw but a lot of

1065
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,599
people

1066
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
they're wasted they're wasted a lot of

1067
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,480
pregnant women they get their blood

1068
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,400
tested they get their blood draw

1069
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,680
they're wasted for a week or two they

1070
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,839
can't function

1071
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,960
after the blood test and you know what

1072
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,720
it leads them to

1073
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,200
wait a minute there might be a problem

1074
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,359
you know it's like all of a sudden now

1075
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,800
we got a pregnant woman who's not

1076
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,880
functioning good

1077
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,640
after the blood test blood draw but they

1078
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,240
don't know why they don't know it's the

1079
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,720
blood draw that did it

1080
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,480
so guess what you better get in here

1081
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,320
because you better get into the office

1082
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,760
because we need to test you again we

1083
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,440
need to get more blood from you

1084
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,599
there's so many women that are pregnant

1085
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,440
that get they get bloodletted

1086
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,720
while they're pregnant with their baby

1087
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,000
and they're getting blood draw

1088
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,480
every week two weeks eight vials seven

1089
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,960
vials

1090
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,000
five vials 12 vials and they're doing it

1091
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,599
because they don't know why they're not

1092
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,920
feeling good there's so many women that

1093
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,839
are

1094
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,680
caught in this vicious cycle it's an

1095
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,359
evil evil vicious cycle right

1096
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,280
so as the immune system breaks down and

1097
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,560
weakens i'm reading the new edition by

1098
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,839
the way if you guys don't have the new

1099
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,920
edition

1100
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:46,480
uh you should stress in life okay

1101
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,960
um pregnancy can lower the immune system

1102
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,760
too

1103
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,720
it's just normal 50 of the of a woman's

1104
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,119
immune system

1105
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,079
protects the baby that's you know also

1106
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,000
menstruation

1107
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,079
if you're not pregnant immune system

1108
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,359
lowers okay i've talked about that a lot

1109
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
of times

1110
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:05,520
so yeah toby says we're at war

1111
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
loon says so sad it's it's unbelievable

1112
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,880
right

1113
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,560
it's just really uncool so what happens

1114
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,839
is all of a sudden

1115
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,400
the virus makes a break it leaves the

1116
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,160
liver

1117
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,440
because your immune system has been

1118
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,640
lowered

1119
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,359
and it heads off to your thyroid so now

1120
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,040
the virus

1121
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,480
heads to your thyroid and that's where

1122
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,800
it goes next

1123
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,880
because that's the next phase and

1124
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
sometimes if the virus was just

1125
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,920
in the liver and it didn't settle in

1126
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
other places it'll start going other

1127
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,760
places too

1128
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,359
not just not just the thyroid the

1129
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,640
thyroid's a common place now you got

1130
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,960
hypothyroidism

1131
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,400
so now you're a woman or a man that's

1132
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,680
got hypothyroidism

1133
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
or you get a stage of hashimoto's

1134
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,119
you get a mild hashimoto's or an

1135
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,000
aggressive hashimoto's depending on the

1136
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,599
virus

1137
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,359
what variety it was that i was talking

1138
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
about okay and then

1139
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,960
now you're somebody that's getting your

1140
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,359
thyroid tested

1141
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,000
all the time so let's just take more

1142
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,079
blood

1143
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,440
okay we're gonna need eight more tubes

1144
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,880
we're gonna need five more tubes we're

1145
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
gonna need four more full

1146
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
tubes and now you're getting more blood

1147
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,720
drawn more blood drawn more blood drawn

1148
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,839
okay every six weeks sometimes

1149
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,520
every three weeks and then now you're

1150
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,720
at the doctor's office all the time and

1151
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,079
you're getting your blood drawn so it's

1152
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,160
a whole other thing too

1153
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,599
keep that in mind sometimes every three

1154
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,240
months but you're getting those blood

1155
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,240
draws

1156
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,760
so now you're at the next phase your

1157
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,920
immune system is weakening

1158
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,599
you've got epstein-barr virus in your

1159
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,440
thyroid okay

1160
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,359
you're losing your immune system during

1161
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,280
draws but you're losing your immune

1162
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,960
system anyway because life here

1163
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,720
we're always our immune system is always

1164
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,040
battling for us it's always up against

1165
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,599
colognes perfumes air fresheners

1166
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,599
scented candles pesticides herbicides

1167
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,160
fungicides toxic heavy metals mercury

1168
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,760
aluminum lead arsenic cadmium copper

1169
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,640
it's against petroleum products plastics

1170
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,119
chemtrails floating out the sky exhaust

1171
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
fumes

1172
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,400
smog pollution polluted water

1173
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,440
pharmaceuticals

1174
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,119
in our drinking water and our immune

1175
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,560
system is already up against all that

1176
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,119
and that's just to name a few not

1177
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,599
including

1178
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,960
asbestos still blowing around ddt still

1179
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,839
blowing around so that's what we're up

1180
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
against

1181
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,599
so now we're at stage three of

1182
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,119
epstein-barr

1183
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,720
and we're getting our blood tested a lot

1184
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,599
and losing our immune system

1185
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,040
so now all of a sudden we have a

1186
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,560
weakened immune system even

1187
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,240
past this we're getting more and more

1188
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,839
blood draws we're losing our immune

1189
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,960
system more and more blood draws more

1190
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,760
and more blood straws

1191
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,240
we're losing our immune system the virus

1192
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,680
then

1193
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,960
builds up enough of

1194
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,000
other viruses meaning the same type of

1195
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,119
virus

1196
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
it's proliferating you're eating foods

1197
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,599
that feed it

1198
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,359
because you're told now you got a

1199
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,680
thyroid problem you better be eating

1200
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,640
these

1201
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,079
delicious eggs right here so your doctor

1202
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,960
is going to say you need to be on

1203
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,640
eggs you need to be on healthy proteins

1204
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,520
you need to be on cheese that's a cheese

1205
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,839
stick right there

1206
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,720
you need to be on your cheese sticks you

1207
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
need to be on

1208
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,319
you should have your hard-boiled eggs

1209
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,440
and salads and get your protein

1210
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,760
get all that you need that too and now

1211
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
you're feeding you're feeding the

1212
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,319
viruses

1213
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,480
it's proliferating you're getting blood

1214
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,200
draws your immune system is dropping

1215
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,319
and then the virus turns into a real

1216
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,560
crap storm

1217
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,520
and now it's stage four for neurological

1218
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,760
symptoms

1219
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,760
okay

1220
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,319
all right so you know so the bottom line

1221
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,720
is

1222
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,560
i talk about the plague today in the

1223
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,079
book by the way

1224
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,000
very important to know um

1225
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,280
so i talk about the plague in this book

1226
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,800
you might want to read it if you have

1227
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,319
any questions on that

1228
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,839
now we're in stage four epstein-barr

1229
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,599
neurological symptoms

1230
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,319
the virus gets strong er

1231
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,839
starts releasing neurotoxins so the

1232
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,440
virus gets an appetite

1233
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,839
starts to release neurotoxins those

1234
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,359
neurotoxins spread throughout the body

1235
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,880
and now you're up against your

1236
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,680
neurological issues

1237
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,240
tingles and numbness aches and pains

1238
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,640
right

1239
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,839
burning skin pain in the neck pain in

1240
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,880
the back

1241
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:14,319
tinnitus vertigo dizziness

1242
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,880
fatigue fatigue

1243
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,359
so you will be up against that fatigue

1244
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,079
and then when you have fatigue

1245
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:23,280
um now you're just at the doctor's

1246
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,480
office all the time but

1247
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,240
now you're not just at the doctor's

1248
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,000
office you're at the specialist they're

1249
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,560
going to need 28 vials they're going to

1250
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,280
need

1251
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,720
18 vials they'll need 14 vials 11 vials

1252
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,160
whatever it is they knock your immune

1253
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,319
system down more and more now you're at

1254
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,560
the lyme doctor too

1255
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,560
now lime doctor wants 40 vials happens

1256
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,920
all the time right

1257
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,839
now the thing is you guys i'm not

1258
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,200
against blood work i'm not against blood

1259
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,640
tests i want you to get your blood

1260
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,640
tested whenever you feel like it

1261
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,240
whatever your doctor's asking right

1262
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,920
but when you listen to the podcast you

1263
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,839
can protect yourself

1264
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,640
so you don't get scammed out of your

1265
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,960
blood scammed out of your immune system

1266
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,040
because that's what it really is it's a

1267
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,160
it's a dangerous scam that's hurt a lot

1268
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,839
of people and they take

1269
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,760
way too much blood they don't need to

1270
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,119
take that much blood and you can

1271
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,520
be your own boss and learn how to be

1272
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
like

1273
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,400
well there's something i can do to

1274
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,359
protect myself and that's what's

1275
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
important so

1276
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,560
i want to make some banana

1277
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,920
lettuce boats in a minute too so stage

1278
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,400
four i've seen the bar we'll cover that

1279
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,680
for one second too

1280
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,560
so now we're in stage four epstein barr

1281
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,560
let's go in there

1282
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,400
stage four of steen bar the ultimate

1283
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,000
goal of the epstein-barr virus

1284
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,760
is for some of its viral cells to

1285
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
venture past your thyroid like i was

1286
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,400
talking about before i already explained

1287
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,560
it

1288
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,000
and inflame your central nervous system

1289
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,359
so the virus builds up

1290
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,240
its numbers it releases uh

1291
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:55,280
um the neurotoxins the neurotoxins land

1292
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,760
on your vagus nerve your phrenic nerves

1293
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,119
and you get the nerve inflammation so

1294
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,720
now you're getting all kinds of

1295
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,720
inflammatory markers if you get a lyme

1296
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,280
disease test that's an inflammation test

1297
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,640
really

1298
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,280
you're not getting tested for the

1299
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,599
bacteria they say you are but they don't

1300
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,440
i know how the lyme labs work okay i

1301
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,880
know a lot of different scientists

1302
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,359
a lot of different lab technicians

1303
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,880
around the world i know a lot of doctors

1304
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,720
what happens is they don't find the

1305
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,160
borrelia at the lime

1306
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,480
at the lab they look for elevations of

1307
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,079
inflammation similar to an a a or c

1308
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,400
reactive protein test

1309
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,119
then they put the bacteria of choice

1310
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,520
next to that

1311
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,560
inflammation it's really a guessing game

1312
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,119
but they plug

1313
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,960
the name of the bacteria in they don't

1314
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,000
find the bacteria see

1315
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,040
you might get an mthfr gene mutation

1316
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,880
test positive another inflammatory test

1317
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,079
you don't have a gene mutation i can

1318
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,599
tell you this right now

1319
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,280
when people get rid of their epstein

1320
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,200
bars like many have

1321
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,400
over the years that i've seen their gene

1322
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,200
mutation test

1323
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,800
often gets normal wait a minute they say

1324
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,280
you can never reverse

1325
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,640
an mthfr gene mutation it's impossible

1326
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,760
to reverse it because it's a gene

1327
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,720
mutation

1328
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,720
wrong why does it go away because the

1329
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,880
gene mutation test is an inflammatory

1330
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,359
marker it's not a gene mutation

1331
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,280
they call it that but it's not so that's

1332
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,319
another pseudoscience technique they

1333
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,440
have so

1334
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,960
that's the whole thing i mean there's a

1335
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,440
lot of pseudoscience out there and

1336
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,760
that's a

1337
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,520
that's a big thing to understand so when

1338
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,359
you get the tinnitus the anxiety the

1339
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
tingles and numbness the chronic fatigue

1340
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,640
the eye

1341
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,400
floaters you're dealing with the

1342
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,680
epstein-barr stage four that's all it's

1343
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,280
not scary

1344
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,640
you know how many people reverse and

1345
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,280
heal that with medical medium books

1346
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,440
that's why

1347
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
they're so known people get rid of that

1348
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,040
they get rid of the fibro pain the nerve

1349
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,960
pain

1350
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:47,119
dino hey why blood draw why blood draw

1351
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,720
is are not accurate for diagnosing ebv

1352
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
so it's talking about how epstein-barr

1353
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,040
works they have a difficult time locking

1354
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,160
down epstein-barr they find the antibody

1355
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,000
but they think

1356
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,359
that was when you had mono sometime in

1357
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,359
your life so the doctor would be like oh

1358
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:02,880
you had mono a long time ago

1359
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:06,720
and um and ebv hides in organs

1360
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,640
it hides in the thyroid now science

1361
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,000
took medical medium information recently

1362
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,319
and they said they found a link to

1363
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,920
epstein-barr to the thyroid now

1364
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,000
but they got it from the medical media

1365
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,280
book one which was published first

1366
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,960
it's actually hilarious right so

1367
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,960
that's how it works it hides in organs

1368
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,480
hides in the liver hides in the thyroid

1369
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,599
it hides in organs very

1370
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,079
very very important to know and

1371
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,800
monolith mononucleosis when you get mono

1372
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,280
at one point that's a full-blown

1373
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,920
blood infection of epstein-barr but

1374
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,599
that's

1375
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,040
not the stages we're talking about now

1376
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,119
we're in the stage of stage four

1377
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,839
epstein-barr we're talking about that

1378
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,520
okay the issues that result from the

1379
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,440
this viral inflammation can include

1380
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,920
muscle pain joint pain painful

1381
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,200
tender points back pain tingles and

1382
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,920
numbness hands and feet

right migraines

1386
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,079
popping sound buzzing humming ringing in

1387
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,680
the ears

1388
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,319
tinnitus eye floaters insomnia dizziness

unrestful sleep night sweats guys

1391
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,160
any of that

1392
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,800
okay chronic fatigue syndrome

1393
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,880
fibromyalgia ra

1394
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,559
all of which are collections of symptoms

1395
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,760
that the medical communities admit they

1396
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,680
don't understand

1397
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,200
and have no cure in such cases the

1398
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,839
patients are given inappropriate

1399
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,280
treatments

1400
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,520
that don't begin to address the real

1401
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,599
culprit because these mystery illnesses

1402
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,680

1456
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,920
you guys the thing is with this blood

1457
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:09,440
draw problem right

1458
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,599
is i'm making a big deal out of this

1459
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,359
but for a reason i can't tell you how

1460
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,559
many people were wasted through the

1461
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,880
process of their

1462
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,720
of their healing journey struggled in

1463
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,280
the worst ways because of it

1464
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,400
even lost their lives complicated their

1465
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,240
illnesses

1466
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,079
i've mentioned the blood draw problem on

1467
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,400
and off over the years i thought people

1468
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,559
would pick up on it

1469
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,079
and they didn't and i was like well what

1470
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:35,440
am i gonna do you know

1471
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:39,280

1473
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,119
until everybody knows you know and

1474
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,400
and and has a way to protect themselves

1475
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,160
because

1476
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,760
and even hearing this or hearing the

1477
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,680
podcast episode there's a chance you'll

1478
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,280
still be in the doctor's office

1479
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,720
or wherever and they're just going to

00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,160
suck the life out of you with all that

1481

worse and but if you really focus and

1486
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,079
and listen to that episode spend some

1487
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:11,440

banana boats right here now

1493
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,040
three bananas calls for

1494
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:32,160
more than three but that's three so i'm

1495
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:36,160
gonna make that

1496
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,400
so i'm going to make a date sauce right

1497
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,400
now

1498
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,880
i got some dates right here

1499
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,880
you got to take the pits out of the

1500
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,839
dates if you don't

1501
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,839
you can get in trouble

1502
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,359
um because you don't want these pits

1503
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,359
from a date

1504
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,359
i've said this like a ton of times said

1505
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,960
this a lot of times i know hundreds of

1506
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,480
times but people still leave pits in

1507
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,319
them by accident

1508
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,640
and they end up like end up getting in

1509
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,640
trouble

1510
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,599
so what do we do one blood test at a

1511
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,839
time

1512
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
okay if you listen to the podcast i give

1513
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,359
you a couple little tips but you got to

1514
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,599
hear the episode really okay

1515
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:21,839
it's important um

1516
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,680
you have the option of asking for half

1517
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:25,920
tubes filled

1518
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,880
so if the doctor was planning on doing

1519
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,920
seven full

1520
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,160
tubes you go with seven half you just

1521
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,079
ask them for seven half tubes

1522
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,359
that's what i i tell family and friends

1523
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,720
you can do whatever you want you can

1524
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,760
listen to your doctor of course they

1525
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,520
want seven tubes

1526
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,800
that that's you and your doctor i'm just

1527
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,240
telling you what i offer friends and

1528
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,680
family right

1529
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,280
and um and or what i would do if i ever

1530
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,480
needed blood work so i made some date

1531
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,640
sauce right there

1532
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,119
i'm making date sauce i mean so let's

1533
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,319
get a little bit of water in here

1534
00:53:53,119 --> 00:54:00,319
about a tablespoon of water okay

1535
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:01,920
and i'm gonna add some lemon too

1536
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,280
so that's one thing you can do the other

1537
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,960
thing is just ask for your doctor to

1538
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,200
break up the tests

1539
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,800
break them up because that's a good way

1540
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,119
of handling it as well it's like

1541
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,800
how about if i just do the metabolic

1542
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,440
panel on the thyroid panel how about if

1543
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,119
i just do

1544
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,599
you know an ana and i do this and i'll

1545
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,359
come back for the other stuff

1546
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:21,440
and that's another thing you can do

1547
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,280
right and you see you're going in there

1548
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,559
doing more

1549
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,599
meaning meaning more visits and less

1550
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,079
blood taken at once right it can make or

1551
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,800
break

1552
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,079
somebody's healing process it could it

1553
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,680
the blood draws

1554
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,799
destroy healing processes i've seen it

1555
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,000
destroy

1556
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:44,799
healing processes like for real like

1557
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,799
that should be good

1558
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:55,040
so um add one more date in here

1559
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,040
it's the date sauce right here

1560
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,440
and

1561
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:04,480
i mean think about it think about having

1562
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:08,160
lyme disease right

1563
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,160
think about having lyme disease okay

1564
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,920
and you've been suffering for a long

1565
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,960
time been seeing different specialists

1566
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:20,559
and doctors

1567
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:22,799
they're drawing a lot of blood right

1568
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,799
and

1569
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,760
and you're losing a lot of blood i might

1570
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,880
not have put enough water in there

1571
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,839
i added a little extra date

1572
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,839
um

1573
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,920
i like the food processor for this is

1574
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,319
what i like

1575
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,400
i'm gonna add a little touch more water

1576
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,240
because i didn't add much at all

1577
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,760
so you can play with this and just make

1578
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,599
it right

1579
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,200
the recipe is really spot on but i'm

1580
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,520
kind of like doing this on the fly a

1581
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,520
little bit

1582
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,040
there you go

1583
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,640
let that kind of go around so you know

1584
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,760
you got lyme disease or not lyme disease

1585
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,760
you're just suffering with any kind of

1586
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,799
chronic fatigue or any kind of illness

1587
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,000
and you're just going through a really

1588
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,599
hard time

1589
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,839
and they're just taking more blood

1590
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,319
taking more blood taking more blood

1591
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,599
and that's how we get in trouble we lose

1592
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:22,960
our immune systems in the process

1593
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,960
add a little bit more water

1594
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,839
these dates are definitely really yummy

1595
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,839
by the way

1596
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,319
are you guys eating dates at all

1597
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:44,400
[Music]

1598
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:58,880
you love dates i saw that

1599
00:56:44,400 --> 00:57:00,559
blending up the date sauce

1600
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,319
so when you get a chance listen to the

1601
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,359
episode

1602
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:07,200
it can really save a life

1603
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,440
the thing is is that they get you slow

1604
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,960
so you don't know it's happening

1605
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,040
see that's the other thing too the

1606
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,079
mistake they've made

1607
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,880
is so bad the mistake they've made is so

1608
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,839
bad

1609
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,040
that it sneaks up on you right it's a

1610
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,799
slow

1611
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:27,040
slow process

1612
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,559
of losing your immune system you just

1613
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,040
never know you're in it

1614
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,400
it could take years as they deplete you

1615
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,000
pull your white count out as

1616
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,359
things get better and then you're doing

1617
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,400
things as things get worse and then

1618
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,599
you're doing things to try to get

1619
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,559
yourself better so

1620
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,720
that's kind of going against it right so

1621
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,640
they're trying to bleed you to death

1622
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,880
whether they know it or not right

1623
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,119
they're trying to blood let you to death

1624
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,720
but it's happening slower because you're

1625
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,319
doing also good things well you're

1626
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,920
taking these supplements here you're

1627
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,960
talking to this other nutritionist here

1628
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,319
you're eating a little better you're

1629
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,079
drinking more water

1630
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,240
maybe you do some juices whatever it is

1631
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,920
you're doing that people do out there

1632
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,760
you're staying away from fast food

1633
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,480
greasy food so you're actually kind of

1634
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,640
like

1635
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,160
about trying to balance the scale while

1636
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,280
they're sucking the life out of you with

1637
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,960
the blood work right

1638
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,640
see how it works taking all that blood

1639
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,480
that they don't need to take

1640
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,559
but there comes a time where just

1641
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,640
practice it just takes you out

1642
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,920
it takes a lot of people out really

1643
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,079
really

1644
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,400
the way it does okay so i got some date

1645
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,960
sauce i'm putting a little date sauce

1646
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,440
drizzling a little bit on here on the

1647
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,440
banana

1648
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,440
so um

1649
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,319
a little bit on the banana boat so this

1650
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,240
is the date sauce

1651
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,599
it's a little bit of lemon with date god

1652
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,240
it's so good it's just

1653
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:46,000
it's so crazy good right you can put as

1654
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,040
much as you want on here i mean

1655
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
i i mean look you can make it your

1656
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,760
favorite way the one

1657
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,200
thing about mackel meat recipes if you

1658
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,559
need to adjust it or something

1659
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,839
and i'm going to add some raisins i

1660
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,960
don't know if you guys are doing raisins

1661
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,440
at all

1662
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,799
it's an option okay and i'm going to

1663
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,839
give you some other options

1664
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,640
too i'm going to put some raisins on the

1665
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,359
banana

1666
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:09,119
right here couple are just falling on

1667
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,599
the lettuce but that's just

1668
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,799
the natural process of having fun right

1669
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,839
this is great for kids keep in mind

1670
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:22,640
this is great for grandchildren

1671
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,200
it's great for children your children

1672
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,920
and

1673
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,440
so putting a few raisins on here this is

1674
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:32,960
for adults too

1675
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:36,880
i love this and

1676
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,079
right so some dates now

1677
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,920
i'll tell you what i love about this i'm

1678
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,760
going to put a little cinnamon

1679
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,160
if that's okay for you guys with you

1680
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,680
guys a little bit of cinnamon

1681
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,040
but actually cinnamon's optional and

1682
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,079
cayenne's optional so i'm probably gonna

1683
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:56,000
put a little cayenne on mine in a minute

1684
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,640
so um what i love about this

1685
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,520
is that you got the mineral salts from

1686
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,880
the lettuce right

1687
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,960
you got the mineral salts those are the

1688
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,319
trace mineral salts they're critical for

1689
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,480
the brain

1690
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:10,160
and strengthen your blood system that's

1691
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,920
the whole thing too right

1692
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,160
and your bloodstream but here's the

1693
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,079
thing too you got the glucose and you

1694
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,040
got other electrolytes from here you got

1695
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,559
the glucose

1696
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,319
from the banana you got the potassium

1697
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,119
from the banana potassium's

1698
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,640
that's a critical electrolyte mineral so

1699
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,880
you got that going on

1700
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,640
and then you got the raisins look i know

1701
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,960
a lot of people like what foods do i eat

1702
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,400
with low iron raisins are high in iron

1703
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,280
okay so that's one right there if you're

1704
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
worried

1705
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,839
but they're higher in iron but the point

1706
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,040
is raisins are also a medicine that's a

1707
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,319
medicinal

1708
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:44,480
grapes are medicinal that's medicine

1709
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,000
so this is a really healthy snack and it

1710
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,480
tastes incredible and then you got the

1711
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,079
lemon with all the calcium in the lemon

1712
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,160
so you got that all the calcium and the

1713
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,839
lemon that's another thing

1714
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,400
