[0.72 - 4.16] fiber
[1.76 - 6.24] the fiber farce
[4.16 - 7.36] what pray tell do i have to say about
[6.24 - 9.76] fiber
[7.36 - 12.64] well let's go into it if you're somebody

[26.24 - 29.68] more fiber
[27.92 - 32.40] that person just needs a little more
[29.68 - 33.28] fiber did you try fiber
[32.40 - 35.76] hey
[33.28 - 37.28] oh whoa you got severe eczema and
[35.76 - 39.76] psoriasis
[37.28 - 42.56] and you you got weakness in the limbs
[39.76 - 44.96] and you're fatigued and you got
[42.56 - 46.64] severe depression do you think fiber
[44.96 - 49.20] will fix it
[46.64 - 50.08] maybe you need some more fiber
[49.20 - 52.48] hey
[50.08 - 54.32] fiber police come out here and tell
[52.48 - 56.24] every sick person on the planet it's
[54.32 - 58.48] because they need more fiber
[56.24 - 60.16] that's what it is perfect
[58.48 - 62.08] we got the answer because you guys know
[60.16 - 63.92] we have the answer to why everybody's
[62.08 - 66.00] sick everybody's suffering from the
[63.92 - 68.08] plague out there right now oh the last
[66.00 - 69.52] two years it's fiber they just needed
[68.08 - 71.60] fiber
[69.52 - 73.12] for god's sake that's all they needed
[71.60 - 74.24] was some fiber
[73.12 - 76.40] brilliant
[74.24 - 79.04] so glad everybody's on the same page it
[76.40 - 82.00] just needed a little bit of fiber
[79.04 - 84.80] you know i'll tell you right now
[82.00 - 88.64] once again it's it's unbelievable
[84.80 - 90.16] because nobody knows why anybody is sick
[88.64 - 91.84] medical research and science doesn't
[90.16 - 93.28] know why anybody is sick
[91.84 - 95.68] they don't
[93.28 - 98.48] they chalk it up to your jeans your
[95.68 - 101.20] genes are bad and that's why you're sick
[98.48 - 103.44] it's your genes or it's your body
[101.20 - 105.84] attacking itself autoimmune right your
[103.44 - 108.00] body is destroying itself well that that
[105.84 - 108.64] theory right maybe you're just creating
[108.00 - 110.32] it
[108.64 - 113.04] bad karma baby
[110.32 - 115.12] maybe it's bad karma that's your karma
[113.04 - 117.44] you're sick in bed now
[115.12 - 120.24] what comes around goes around it's your
[117.44 - 122.16] karma it's gotta be that
[120.24 - 124.24] oh maybe you're sick and you can't
[122.16 - 128.52] function because you had your head
[124.24 - 128.52] chopped off in 1602
[128.80 - 135.92] you know and maybe something maybe you
[131.52 - 138.40] died in a fire in 1715 somewhere maybe
[135.92 - 140.40] something else happened you know and so
[138.40 - 142.88] you know and what happens is we don't
[140.40 - 144.48] know why anybody's sick nobody knows why
[142.88 - 146.00] anybody's sick
[144.48 - 147.76] and people are getting sicker and sicker
[146.00 - 150.72] and faster and faster and life
[147.76 - 153.84] expectancy is dropping life expectancy
[150.72 - 157.52] is dropping and dropping
[153.84 - 160.72] guess what they're hiding it too
[157.52 - 161.84] they're hiding life expectancy they're
[160.72 - 164.08] actually
[161.84 - 166.88] hiding it
[164.08 - 169.84] it's dropping faster than they say they
[166.88 - 172.32] need you to be under the illusion that
[169.84 - 174.56] everybody's living longer and living
[172.32 - 177.12] healthier and living happier that the
[174.56 - 178.88] illusion is there and hey if you're not
[177.12 - 181.68] living longer and healthier you probably
[178.88 - 182.84] just needed some fiber
[181.68 - 186.40] you
[182.84 - 188.64] know the world is so screwed up
[186.40 - 189.76] in so many ways
[188.64 - 193.20] that when
[189.76 - 196.24] it's screwed up in the health realm it's
[193.20 - 198.88] really bad because hey
[196.24 - 202.16] everybody says oh health is wealth oh
[198.88 - 202.16] man when i hear that i just
[202.24 - 206.72] i hate that one
[203.70 - 208.24] [Laughter]
[206.72 - 210.00] health is wealth
[208.24 - 211.60] right that one
[210.00 - 214.32] yeah well it's good thing you're taking
[211.60 - 215.36] care of yourself health is wealth
[214.32 - 217.68] you know
[215.36 - 218.48] people don't realize
[217.68 - 221.28] that
[218.48 - 223.44] there's sinister reasons
[221.28 - 226.40] why people are sick
[223.44 - 228.24] sinister reasons the system is built to
[226.40 - 229.68] take people down destroy them and kill
[228.24 - 232.64] them
[229.68 - 236.08] the sith the illumination needs to
[232.64 - 240.08] eliminate people so they set up the
[236.08 - 242.48] system to purposely eliminate people and
[240.08 - 244.64] that's how the system is set up and at
[242.48 - 247.12] the same time completely
[244.64 - 249.12] everybody that life expectancy is
[247.12 - 250.96] getting better and better and better and
[249.12 - 253.60] better
[250.96 - 256.80] it's almost like you just brain screw
[253.60 - 259.68] you along the way and then some doctor
[256.80 - 262.32] will come out hey i'm doctors
[259.68 - 264.48] this is my five best tips to get more
[262.32 - 266.72] fiber into your life i'll even come out
[264.48 - 269.28] with maybe another book or a next book
[266.72 - 271.92] about fiber you just need fiber in your
[269.28 - 275.68] life that's the answer lots of fiber in
[271.92 - 275.68] your life will take care of everything
[276.56 - 281.68] let's talk about fiber let's let's let's
[279.12 - 284.16] go you guys just so you know
[281.68 - 286.88] you're looking at the mm-900 hds and the
[284.16 - 288.72] sale is gonna eventually end
[286.88 - 291.28] it's gonna get there
[288.72 - 291.28] and then
[292.00 - 295.44] and then
[293.28 - 297.04] when i'm sitting in a car somewhere i'm
[295.44 - 300.16] gonna have to roll down the window and
[297.04 - 302.24] scream my head off when i see someone
[300.16 - 304.32] leave a comment saying
[302.24 - 306.24] how did i miss the sale
[304.32 - 308.08] hey do you have a juicer out there that
[306.24 - 309.68] works really good
[308.08 - 311.84] the sale is coming to an end it's the
[309.68 - 314.56] mm-900 hds if you hang on i'm going to
[311.84 - 317.20] show you how the dry pulp it's not a
[314.56 - 318.88] magic trick how the pulp is dry and you
[317.20 - 321.28] save money someone left a comment said
[318.88 - 323.44] yeah in 20 years you'll save money on
[321.28 - 325.28] that juicer in 20 years are you kidding
[323.44 - 327.84] the juicer paid for itself over and over
[325.28 - 330.64] again with just just my juicer meaning
[327.84 - 332.48] like me juicing has paid for itself over
[330.64 - 333.84] and over again i got family members that
[332.48 - 336.08] use the juicer and they're like you know
[333.84 - 338.48] i saved this much i'm keeping track i
[336.08 - 340.96] bought less produce it's adding up it's
[338.48 - 343.36] now like 50 a month
[340.96 - 344.72] and then boom paid for a juicer
[343.36 - 347.68] that's incredible
[344.72 - 349.68] okay let's talk about fiber
[347.68 - 352.16] so the big attack
[349.68 - 354.64] is you need your fiber if you've got to
[352.16 - 356.72] have your fiber that's what it is and
[354.64 - 358.24] it's an attack on the juicy world but
[356.72 - 360.56] it's not just attack on the juicing
[358.24 - 363.60] world it's attack on your your mental
[360.56 - 365.92] consciousness it's attack on you because
[363.60 - 367.12] you're gonna think maybe that's why i'm
[365.92 - 369.76] sick
[367.12 - 374.40] you can you can be someone that eats
[369.76 - 376.16] white bread processed white dough
[374.40 - 378.72] and you don't get sick
[376.16 - 380.64] you can be somebody that eats gluten
[378.72 - 384.32] filled processed
[380.64 - 386.64] white dough white flour dough balls and
[384.32 - 388.96] then fries them in oil
[386.64 - 390.16] and not be sick
[388.96 - 392.16] i know
[390.16 - 395.20] some people over the years
[392.16 - 398.56] literally living on fried dough and
[395.20 - 401.68] they're not sick and they're pooping
[398.56 - 405.52] just fine they got no fiber in their
[401.68 - 405.52] diet and they're pooping
[405.60 - 410.80] that's what's happening i know people
[408.48 - 413.36] that are eating white bread a loaf of
[410.80 - 415.12] white bread and butter and they can poo
[413.36 - 417.60] just fine
[415.12 - 419.92] and they're not sick and then
[417.60 - 421.52] i know people that are eating fruits and
[419.92 - 424.48] vegetables
[421.52 - 426.48] and can't poo at all
[424.48 - 429.60] i know people that are eating
[426.48 - 430.32] plenty of fiber but they still have to
[429.60 - 434.20] take
[430.32 - 438.00] fiber supplements and fiber drinks and
[434.20 - 440.80] prescribed fiber medications because
[438.00 - 442.64] something's wrong inside fiber has
[440.80 - 445.44] nothing to do
[442.64 - 448.32] with something going wrong and something
[445.44 - 451.68] being wrong inside of you it's not the
[448.32 - 455.92] fiber that keeps cancer away it's not
[451.68 - 458.64] the fiber that keeps disease away it's
[455.92 - 461.28] what was in the plant that wasn't the
[458.64 - 464.72] fiber the fiber is not where the
[461.28 - 467.84] medicine is the medicine is in the juice
[464.72 - 470.56] of the plant you guys this is so
[467.84 - 470.56] critical
[471.04 - 474.64] the fiber
[472.88 - 478.96] in the plant
[474.64 - 482.48] is your bones in a human being
[478.96 - 485.52] fiber growing a plant out of a ground
[482.48 - 489.04] the fiber's just there so the plant can
[485.52 - 491.52] erect itself and reach the sun
[489.04 - 494.80] that's what fiber is fiber fibrin and
[491.52 - 496.64] asparagus okay you guys is to get the
[494.80 - 499.60] asparagus shoot
[496.64 - 502.72] to actually reach up for the sun that's
[499.60 - 504.96] what fiber's for the fiber in a plant
[502.72 - 506.56] isn't there to save your life it's a
[504.96 - 509.28] good thing
[506.56 - 511.60] fiber is a good thing if fiber's not a
[509.28 - 513.44] terrible thing fiber is not a bad thing
[511.60 - 515.60] no no no
[513.44 - 518.24] it's not
[515.60 - 521.52] fiber is a good thing but the fiber is
[518.24 - 524.80] to bring the plant to the sun it's the
[521.52 - 528.24] skeleton is what it is and it's bringing
[524.80 - 530.96] the plant to the sun so that the platzo
[528.24 - 533.92] fiber in here
[530.96 - 536.24] you won't be able to digest the fiber
[533.92 - 538.32] the fiber will be just eliminated and
[536.24 - 539.84] we'll be you'll be eliminating it you'll
[538.32 - 542.24] be getting it out of your body when you
[539.84 - 545.04] go to bathroom
[542.24 - 547.36] but the fiber
[545.04 - 552.08] is a skeleton
[547.36 - 556.00] of the plant to get the plant to have
[552.08 - 559.44] to have stability and strength to to to
[556.00 - 561.92] not just lay like this on the ground the
[559.44 - 564.16] fiber is to help the plant actually
[561.92 - 565.76] become something right
[564.16 - 567.92] that's what it's for
[565.76 - 570.32] it's critical to know this
[567.92 - 573.20] but the medicine that stops you from
[570.32 - 575.04] getting sick is not the fiber the
[573.20 - 578.40] medicine that stops you from getting
[575.04 - 580.32] sick is the phytochemical compounds
[578.40 - 583.20] is to trace minerals
[580.32 - 585.92] fiber is not a trace mineral
[583.20 - 587.36] fiber is not a trace mineral fiber is
[585.92 - 589.44] not zinc
[587.36 - 591.52] fiber
[589.44 - 593.20] is not zinc
[591.52 - 597.12] fiber's not boron
[593.20 - 601.04] fiber isn't magnesium
[597.12 - 604.16] fiber's not anthocyanins
[601.04 - 607.92] fiber is not resveratrol
[604.16 - 610.08] fiber's not vitamin c fiber is not b12
[607.92 - 611.52] fibers does this make any sense
[610.08 - 613.76] fiber is not
[611.52 - 615.76] phytochemical compounds that stop cancer
[613.76 - 618.56] and stop disease
[615.76 - 621.20] fiber is not antiviral compounds and
[618.56 - 623.36] antibacterial compounds that's not fiber
[621.20 - 627.04] did you guys know that it's those things
[623.36 - 627.04] that stop disease and illness
[627.12 - 630.80] fiber
[628.88 - 632.56] is the skeleton
[630.80 - 634.80] of the plant
[632.56 - 636.16] so the plant can stand up straight and
[634.80 - 639.20] get some sun
[636.16 - 639.20] that's what fibrous
[640.48 - 645.92] fiber is similar not the same thing
[643.76 - 648.32] but similar by the way my skeleton lost
[645.92 - 648.32] the leg
[649.04 - 653.20] fiber
[650.16 - 654.80] is similar to your bones
[653.20 - 660.04] your bones
[654.80 - 660.04] are there so you can stand up straight
[660.88 - 664.72] that's what your bones are there for so
[662.72 - 666.72] you can stand up straight it's there for
[664.72 - 669.52] the animal to stand up straight it's
[666.72 - 672.32] there for the dog to stand up straight
[669.52 - 675.44] the dog's fiber really is the bones of
[672.32 - 678.24] the dog right so the dog can stand up
[675.44 - 680.88] straight so the pig can stand up
[678.24 - 682.32] straight that's the fiber that's part of
[680.88 - 683.92] it meaning that's what it's like for
[682.32 - 686.00] plants it's not exactly like that
[683.92 - 688.80] totally like for humans but but that's
[686.00 - 691.60] what i'm using its example
[688.80 - 694.32] fiber in the plant is so the plant can
[691.60 - 696.80] get to the sun so it can be seen so it
[694.32 - 699.68] can rise above the other plants so
[696.80 - 703.44] they're having a fiber war plants have a
[699.68 - 705.92] fiber war to try to rise up off the
[703.44 - 708.72] ground so they can get the sun and they
[705.92 - 712.24] can get what they need so they can
[708.72 - 716.12] create those nutrients
[712.24 - 716.12] it's critical to know
[716.24 - 718.48] right
[718.56 - 722.80] good to see you guys by the way i'm
[720.16 - 726.40] going to be juicing some celery
[722.80 - 728.16] i'm going to talk about the mm-900 hds
[726.40 - 731.68] fiber
[728.16 - 734.16] can't be digested at all
[731.68 - 735.60] when you have nothing wrong with your
[734.16 - 738.08] gut
[735.60 - 740.56] you can still go to bathroom
[738.08 - 741.36] no matter what you can go to bathroom if
[740.56 - 744.08] just
[741.36 - 746.80] water goes in you if just juice goes in
[744.08 - 749.36] you it's just a liquid goes in you it's
[746.80 - 751.44] just bread goes in you if dough it's
[749.36 - 752.96] doughnuts
[751.44 - 754.72] i know people that don't have anything
[752.96 - 756.72] wrong with their gut they don't have all
[754.72 - 758.88] the bad bacteria that ripped apart their
[756.72 - 761.28] gut they don't have all kinds of
[758.88 - 763.20] different viruses yet they don't have
[761.28 - 765.20] these things they don't have metals in
[763.20 - 767.28] their brain messing up their peristaltic
[765.20 - 769.20] action so because they don't have that
[767.28 - 770.32] yet and maybe they're working on it but
[769.20 - 771.68] they don't have it maybe they're working
[770.32 - 773.04] on catching a virus maybe they're
[771.68 - 775.28] working on catching bacteria maybe
[773.04 - 777.44] they're working on catching so i mean
[775.28 - 779.28] getting contamination by something but
[777.44 - 780.56] what happens is they can still go to
[779.28 - 783.76] bathroom
[780.56 - 784.72] they can eat bread and butter and drink
[783.76 - 786.96] beer
[784.72 - 789.36] and they'll be on the toilet go in the
[786.96 - 792.56] bathroom as if nothing was wrong they
[789.36 - 792.56] didn't need any fiber
[792.96 - 795.68] because
[794.24 - 797.60] and then there's people that get all the
[795.68 - 799.76] fiber you want but they can lose all
[797.60 - 802.56] peristaltic action you guys this is
[799.76 - 805.52] important to know there's people okay
[802.56 - 807.36] that have that that eat all the fiber
[805.52 - 809.20] you can put all the fiber you want in
[807.36 - 812.08] them but they've got no peristaltic
[809.20 - 814.24] action they can't go to bathroom they're
[812.08 - 816.72] still in there because they're inflamed
[814.24 - 817.84] they have problems inside the gut
[816.72 - 822.36] problems
[817.84 - 827.76] juicing helps to fix but meanwhile the
[822.36 - 830.16] anti-juicing world the fiber freaks
[827.76 - 831.92] the fiber cult
[830.16 - 836.40] the fiber cult
[831.92 - 838.72] yeah the fiber cold the fiber freaks
[836.40 - 840.56] they want to scare you
[838.72 - 842.32] people can put all the fiber they want
[840.56 - 843.92] but if they got something corking out
[842.32 - 845.84] their vagus nerve if they got
[843.92 - 848.00] peristaltic action that died because
[845.84 - 850.24] they got gastroparesis because they got
[848.00 - 851.44] severe problems they got neurological
[850.24 - 853.04] problems that aren't allowing
[851.44 - 855.68] gastroparesis
[853.04 - 857.84] fiber can't fix it
[855.68 - 861.12] in fact they can't even eat fiber it
[857.84 - 861.12] moistens their condition
[861.60 - 865.52] and here's the irony fibers in
[863.12 - 869.12] everything you're never going to be
[865.52 - 871.20] fiber free 100 unless you want to go on
[869.12 - 873.36] bread you want to go on bread you're
[871.20 - 875.28] never going to get any fiber sure
[873.36 - 876.96] you can go on a loaf of bread got some
[875.28 - 878.48] mock bread right here
[876.96 - 882.36] some fake bread
[878.48 - 882.36] you can go on some bread
[886.80 - 891.20] i'm talking about processed white bread
[888.64 - 893.28] not talking about whole grain fibrous
[891.20 - 896.08] bread
[893.28 - 898.24] hi uw i miss your shows

[910.48 - 913.60] let you guys know but we're covering hot
[912.16 - 915.20] topics we're covering powerful
[913.60 - 917.92] information
[915.20 - 919.60] juicing is just a powerful addition to
[917.92 - 923.12] all the good things you're having i want
[919.60 - 928.08] people to get fiber but i'm not saying
[923.12 - 929.88] get fiber i'm saying get your antiviral
[928.08 - 932.00] medicine get your
[929.88 - 935.04] antibacterial medicine
[932.00 - 938.80] get your phytochemical compounds and
[935.04 - 941.76] your trace mineral salts get those right
[938.80 - 944.32] get your critical glucose get your
[941.76 - 947.68] sulfur which is a chemical compound and
[944.32 - 950.24] say a food like cabbage cruciferous
[947.68 - 953.04] chemical compounds like sulfur get that
[950.24 - 954.80] in your life get anti-viral compounds
[953.04 - 957.68] fiber
[954.80 - 960.72] that's automatically there
[957.68 - 963.28] that's automatically there
[960.72 - 964.88] so we need other things from all the
[963.28 - 966.64] fruits and vegetables leafy greens and
[964.88 - 969.20] wild foods and everything else and herbs
[966.64 - 971.20] we get we need more
[969.20 - 974.16] we're getting more than fiber
[971.20 - 976.32] fiber's an in it's a guarantee unless
[974.16 - 977.76] there's somebody just unprocessed flour
[976.32 - 980.72] only like i know some people and they
[977.76 - 984.16] still go to bathroom fine
[980.72 - 986.64] it's a guarantee you're fibered out
[984.16 - 987.84] you've got plenty of fiber going in
[986.64 - 990.88] there
[987.84 - 993.12] you're eating your fiber it's there if
[990.88 - 996.00] you can't go to bathroom we got another
[993.12 - 998.24] problem we got inflammation around the
[996.00 - 1000.64] bend
[998.24 - 1002.64] this is a highway right here and if you
[1000.64 - 1004.40] picture a car going through here it's
[1002.64 - 1007.52] like this
[1004.40 - 1007.52] whoa go around that bend
[1007.60 - 1010.60] oh
[1013.36 - 1015.96] and that's what's happening is the car
[1014.56 - 1017.76] is going through here
[1015.96 - 1019.92] [Music]
[1017.76 - 1022.72] all around the bend right and all of a
[1019.92 - 1024.88] sudden you've got food and it's going
[1022.72 - 1027.04] uh
[1024.88 - 1028.16] and it's stuck
[1027.04 - 1031.12] that means
[1028.16 - 1031.12] something's wrong
[1032.00 - 1035.84] and you've been eating fiber your whole
[1033.52 - 1038.32] life you can go and get the greasiest
[1035.84 - 1040.32] double bacon double cheeseburger and
[1038.32 - 1041.84] they'll be probably still more fiber in
[1040.32 - 1044.64] that greasy
[1041.84 - 1046.40] gross bacon double cheeseburger
[1044.64 - 1049.20] then you can think of there's still some
[1046.40 - 1049.20] fiber in there
[1049.20 - 1054.72] but if you can't go to bathroom anymore
[1052.16 - 1056.48] you got something stuck
[1054.72 - 1059.04] you got a problem in there or you're
[1056.48 - 1061.28] getting a mixed signal it's mixed it's
[1059.04 - 1062.40] coming from the vagus nerve so the vagus
[1061.28 - 1064.24] nerves
[1062.40 - 1065.76] right are shooting out of your brain
[1064.24 - 1068.56] stem
[1065.76 - 1070.96] two vagus nerves
[1068.56 - 1072.48] coming out of your brain stem
[1070.96 - 1074.56] two
[1072.48 - 1076.56] right
[1074.56 - 1078.72] you got your vagus nerves coming out of
[1076.56 - 1080.80] your brain stem and they're coming down
[1078.72 - 1082.56] all through here they're rerouting and
[1080.80 - 1084.88] they're sending signals to your gut and
[1082.56 - 1087.36] they're telling your gut to peristaltic
[1084.88 - 1090.40] action you've got a peristaltic action
[1087.36 - 1092.64] go ahead and twist twist and turn get
[1090.40 - 1094.08] the get the poo to move through get
[1092.64 - 1095.84] whatever it is you're eating to move
[1094.08 - 1097.36] through get your food to move through
[1095.84 - 1099.12] get your fiber to move through whatever
[1097.36 - 1102.08] you want to call it get it to move
[1099.12 - 1103.68] through and if it's not moving through
[1102.08 - 1106.00] we're inflamed
[1103.68 - 1108.24] or there's a miss messages mixed
[1106.00 - 1111.76] messages coming from the brain through
[1108.24 - 1115.04] the vagus nerves on down the path to the
[1111.76 - 1118.16] intestinal tract and guess what
[1115.04 - 1118.16] we have a problem
[1118.48 - 1123.68] and that's what's going on
[1122.08 - 1125.76] so then
[1123.68 - 1127.36] you talk to a health professional and
[1125.76 - 1130.00] the health professional is just going to
[1127.36 - 1132.64] be like you know like
[1130.00 - 1135.36] oh all you need is a little bit of fiber
[1132.64 - 1137.84] did you increase your water
[1135.36 - 1139.68] how many times do i have to insult you
[1137.84 - 1142.32] you probably never tried to increase
[1139.68 - 1143.76] water yet oh you have
[1142.32 - 1146.32] oh what do you mean it's the first thing
[1143.76 - 1148.08] you learned nonsense
[1146.32 - 1149.36] you didn't increase your water or your
[1148.08 - 1151.52] fiber
[1149.36 - 1154.40] increase your water and your fiber
[1151.52 - 1157.52] if that doesn't fix it it's your jeans
[1154.40 - 1159.92] you're just a broken toy
[1157.52 - 1164.16] you're just broken your jeans are broken
[1159.92 - 1166.32] if fiber and water doesn't fix it
[1164.16 - 1168.96] then maybe you have lectin problems oh
[1166.32 - 1171.36] wait a minute maybe you have celacic
[1168.96 - 1172.80] acid problems i read an article about
[1171.36 - 1175.28] that
[1172.80 - 1176.16] maybe you got oxalate issues
[1175.28 - 1178.64] oh
[1176.16 - 1181.12] can't go to bathroom probably oxalate
[1178.64 - 1181.12] issues
[1181.76 - 1185.44] anyway
[1183.68 - 1186.88] the one thing to know there's a lot of
[1185.44 - 1189.12] different important things to think
[1186.88 - 1191.76] about okay
[1189.12 - 1194.00] the one thing to know
[1191.76 - 1196.96] is that you can't fall into the fiber
[1194.00 - 1199.28] trap you're getting fiber
[1196.96 - 1201.84] you're getting fiber you can go to bed
[1199.28 - 1203.84] at night and recite it to yourself
[1201.84 - 1206.48] you're getting fiber
[1203.84 - 1208.88] but you know what you're not getting if
[1206.48 - 1210.56] you're not juicing your celery juice
[1208.88 - 1213.28] you're not getting the sodium cluster
[1210.56 - 1214.72] salts that are anti-viral antibacterial
[1213.28 - 1216.00] you're not getting the vitamin c that
[1214.72 - 1217.12] doesn't have to be converted by the
[1216.00 - 1220.00] liver
[1217.12 - 1222.88] you're not getting the things you need
[1220.00 - 1227.12] and that's critical to know
[1222.88 - 1229.92] pathogens inflame the intestinal tract
[1227.12 - 1232.64] pathogens inflame the intestinal tract
[1229.92 - 1236.08] so what happens is we get pathogens
[1232.64 - 1237.44] inside the intestinal intestinal tract
[1236.08 - 1238.88] there they go
[1237.44 - 1240.16] and they get in there they find their
[1238.88 - 1242.08] way in there and they find their way
[1240.16 - 1244.24] real easy too they get into that
[1242.08 - 1246.64] intestinal tract real easy they get into
[1244.24 - 1248.72] the colon really easy when they get in
[1246.64 - 1250.72] there and they're in
[1248.72 - 1252.72] you've got colitis
[1250.72 - 1256.88] you've got celiac
[1252.72 - 1258.96] you got ibs you got sibo you got crohn's
[1256.88 - 1261.20] you've got gastric spasms you've got
[1258.96 - 1264.56] gastroparesis you've got all kinds of
[1261.20 - 1266.96] other things it's it's the bugs inside
[1264.56 - 1269.04] your gut and those bugs can get in there
[1266.96 - 1271.12] and cause a lot of problems and if
[1269.04 - 1273.60] that's not all it's the heavy metals
[1271.12 - 1275.68] that get inside the brain and all those
[1273.60 - 1278.08] toxic heavy metals and they're sending
[1275.68 - 1279.92] signals down your vagus nerves shooting
[1278.08 - 1281.52] out of your brain stem under here so
[1279.92 - 1283.84] right under here you've got your vagus
[1281.52 - 1285.52] nerves and the signal's going out and as
[1283.84 - 1287.44] the signal is going out
[1285.52 - 1289.84] you're getting a message to here that's
[1287.44 - 1291.28] not making it twist so we're not
[1289.84 - 1294.80] twisting
[1291.28 - 1294.80] we're not twisting anymore
[1297.76 - 1301.04] and if you're eating gluten you're
[1299.04 - 1303.28] feeding the pathogen so it only gets
[1301.04 - 1304.72] worse
[1303.28 - 1307.60] fiber
[1304.72 - 1310.08] won't fix it because it can't be an
[1307.60 - 1313.60] antiviral your fiber's not an
[1310.08 - 1315.52] antibacterial your fiber is not medicine
[1313.60 - 1317.84] i love it when someone wakes up one
[1315.52 - 1320.96] morning and they come out of a stupor in
[1317.84 - 1324.08] the health field somebody maybe an md or
[1320.96 - 1325.84] an nd or some kind of practitioner or a
[1324.08 - 1327.76] dietitian they wake up one morning and
[1325.84 - 1330.80] they're like
[1327.76 - 1332.80] i think i got the problem it's fiber
[1330.80 - 1334.72] i'm going to do an article now about how
[1332.80 - 1337.28] fiber is so important and let me
[1334.72 - 1339.44] research all the other bs about fiber
[1337.28 - 1341.84] that's been talked about for years it's
[1339.44 - 1344.08] like a train of misinformation that's
[1341.84 - 1345.76] gone wrong you can hop on there and play
[1344.08 - 1347.28] on google all day long and play on the
[1345.76 - 1349.52] internet and play on social media and be
[1347.28 - 1352.16] like i found another article on fiverr
[1349.52 - 1354.40] this was written in 2012. well this
[1352.16 - 1355.84] article here in fiber's written in 2014.
[1354.40 - 1358.08] here's an article about the best ways to
[1355.84 - 1360.00] get fiber in you and how important it is
[1358.08 - 1362.08] and next thing you know you're gone
[1360.00 - 1364.08] you're lost you're gone and if you're a
[1362.08 - 1365.52] practitioner or a health person and make
[1364.08 - 1367.36] a somebody that's in the field of
[1365.52 - 1368.72] medicine you're really now screwed
[1367.36 - 1370.08] because now you're going to be telling
[1368.72 - 1371.92] your patients
[1370.08 - 1375.28] maybe it's more fiber you need i've read
[1371.92 - 1376.24] an interest interesting article juicing
[1375.28 - 1378.96] what
[1376.24 - 1381.76] no no no don't juice that would be
[1378.96 - 1381.76] really bad
[1385.04 - 1390.08] you guys we're live right now having a
[1387.12 - 1392.40] little fun we're talking about fiber
[1390.08 - 1394.32] talking about the fiber farce how about
[1392.40 - 1398.16] that
[1394.32 - 1399.84] fiber does not have nutrients in it
[1398.16 - 1401.68] fiber
[1399.84 - 1406.08] is empty
[1401.68 - 1406.08] fiber is the skeleton of the plant
[1409.44 - 1414.40] fiber's not the reason why anybody's
[1412.08 - 1414.40] sick
[1414.56 - 1417.84] very important to know
[1420.32 - 1424.40] we're juicing celery right now a couple
[1422.48 - 1427.44] tips gotta strain your celery juice at
[1424.40 - 1429.76] the end i'll show you how that works
[1427.44 - 1431.92] michelle l says fiber hurts for a lot of
[1429.76 - 1434.32] people with intestinal problems fiber
[1431.92 - 1434.32] hurts
[1437.28 - 1441.44] don't get cheated
[1439.12 - 1443.68] out of benefiting your life changing
[1441.44 - 1445.52] your life turning it around don't get
[1443.68 - 1448.40] cheated out of that because somebody
[1445.52 - 1451.84] throws the whole you should be getting
[1448.40 - 1454.80] the fiber so don't juice don't let
[1451.84 - 1457.92] someone cheat you out of that
[1454.80 - 1461.04] beautiful privilege that we can get and
[1457.92 - 1464.08] obtain which is actually being able to
[1461.04 - 1466.72] bring our lives back from juicing
[1464.08 - 1469.28] this is a medicine maker you're seeing
[1466.72 - 1471.04] herbal medicine be made in front of your
[1469.28 - 1472.56] eyes right now sure we can take it for
[1471.04 - 1474.40] granted
[1472.56 - 1476.56] we can take it for granted
[1474.40 - 1479.04] i can take this machine for granted i
[1476.56 - 1480.72] can take juicing celery for granted
[1479.04 - 1482.16] definitely
[1480.72 - 1484.24] but when you really think what's
[1482.16 - 1487.52] happening it's pretty incredible
[1484.24 - 1490.08] go back to a few hundred years ago go
[1487.52 - 1491.60] back to a few hundred years ago right
[1490.08 - 1493.36] okay
[1491.60 - 1496.16] you got someone that's trying to pull
[1493.36 - 1497.12] water out of a well a muddy well
[1496.16 - 1498.48] right
[1497.12 - 1499.68] think about it
[1498.48 - 1500.56] okay
[1499.68 - 1502.40] and
[1500.56 - 1503.44] they're slaughtering the only animal
[1502.40 - 1504.64] they have
[1503.44 - 1506.40] to survive
[1504.64 - 1508.72] they're slaughtering their cow that
[1506.40 - 1510.00] creates the dairy they need because it's
[1508.72 - 1511.60] the winter
[1510.00 - 1514.56] right
[1511.60 - 1516.48] and they're they're now cooking animal
[1514.56 - 1517.60] meat which i'm not against animal
[1516.48 - 1519.60] protein eaters i'm not against
[1517.60 - 1520.48] plant-based people right
[1519.60 - 1523.04] okay
[1520.48 - 1524.64] they got some leftover
[1523.04 - 1527.60] grain
[1524.64 - 1531.60] got some leftover barley or wheat most
[1527.60 - 1534.40] likely wheat they got leftover wheat
[1531.60 - 1537.44] so they have leftover wheat
[1534.40 - 1539.52] they get some well water from their well
[1537.44 - 1541.28] muddy well water
[1539.52 - 1544.24] they're cooking their last animals to
[1541.28 - 1546.32] survive to get to spring right
[1544.24 - 1548.80] and if you if you knocked on their door
[1546.32 - 1550.56] on that colonial house
[1548.80 - 1552.96] and knocked down that door or wherever
[1550.56 - 1555.12] they were in this world and you knocked
[1552.96 - 1556.56] on their door and you went back in the
[1555.12 - 1559.28] past because you're from the future
[1556.56 - 1563.04] you're from 2021 and you went back in
[1559.28 - 1564.48] the past and you knocked on that door
[1563.04 - 1567.28] he said i want to show you guys
[1564.48 - 1569.20] something and you had a stack of celery
[1567.28 - 1571.36] and you brought this machine in and
[1569.20 - 1573.92] magically had the ability to have power
[1571.36 - 1575.60] because the story is
[1573.92 - 1578.32] magical anyway
[1575.60 - 1580.48] and you popped a juicer in front of them
[1578.32 - 1581.44] and you said
[1580.48 - 1583.44] we're going to clear up your
[1581.44 - 1585.52] deficiencies we're going to bring your
[1583.44 - 1587.36] home we're gonna bring you back you're
[1585.52 - 1589.60] gonna have you're not gonna have the
[1587.36 - 1591.76] scurvy we're gonna get rid of any scurvy
[1589.60 - 1595.20] we're gonna get rid of rickets
[1591.76 - 1596.96] your children aren't gonna be deficient
[1595.20 - 1599.60] we're gonna give you a fresh glass of
[1596.96 - 1601.44] celery juice right out of the future and
[1599.60 - 1603.28] we're going to juice it in an herbal
[1601.44 - 1605.28] medicine maker
[1603.28 - 1608.56] they would probably
[1605.28 - 1608.56] have a heart attack
[1610.40 - 1614.72] because their mind would be so blown
[1614.88 - 1617.36] you couldn't
[1615.92 - 1620.48] even when you really think about your
[1617.36 - 1620.48] mind would be so blown
[1622.16 - 1624.64] you guys
[1624.88 - 1629.60] i don't i don't take it for granted i
[1626.80 - 1629.60] know what this is
[1629.68 - 1635.20] it's a way to bring back our health
[1633.28 - 1637.92] it's a way to take control over our
[1635.20 - 1637.92] lives right
[1638.16 - 1642.32] and that's what this is and that's
[1639.92 - 1644.64] what's really special about it
[1642.32 - 1646.48] that's just one thing
[1644.64 - 1648.88] but i love when nobody knows why
[1646.48 - 1651.76] anybody's big
[1648.88 - 1653.92] but they got so many answers out there
[1651.76 - 1655.28] so many answers they don't know why
[1653.92 - 1658.08] anybody's sick
[1655.28 - 1658.08] nobody knows
[1658.80 - 1662.00] it's all a guessing game
[1663.60 - 1669.84] mary says doesn't fiber move poo out of
[1667.12 - 1669.84] the system
[1672.40 - 1678.40] fiber doesn't move poo out of the system
[1676.24 - 1680.24] your intestinal tract moves the poo out
[1678.40 - 1681.76] of your system
[1680.24 - 1684.16] you can be somebody
[1681.76 - 1686.48] that's literally on white bread
[1684.16 - 1688.32] processed bread dough
[1686.48 - 1690.88] doughnuts
[1688.32 - 1691.92] and your peristaltic action
[1690.88 - 1695.12] you're gonna you could be somebody
[1691.92 - 1696.80] that's on meat which has no fiber in it
[1695.12 - 1699.12] and you're gonna in your peristaltic
[1696.80 - 1701.36] action if it's working mary
[1699.12 - 1702.56] it's gonna push the meat out and the
[1701.36 - 1704.08] dough
[1702.56 - 1706.96] you can be somebody that lives off of
[1704.08 - 1707.84] white bread meat sandwiches
[1706.96 - 1712.08] white
[1707.84 - 1714.08] processed bread meat sandwiches
[1712.08 - 1716.32] and you can be eating a white bread meat
[1714.08 - 1718.96] sandwich and people will poo it out
[1716.32 - 1722.32] because their peristaltic action is is
[1718.96 - 1725.28] doing the contorting act to get it out
[1722.32 - 1726.88] and squeeze it out you can be on just
[1725.28 - 1728.96] meat
[1726.88 - 1730.88] plain old meat
[1728.96 - 1732.48] and you literally your if your
[1730.88 - 1734.72] peristaltic action is working because
[1732.48 - 1737.04] you don't have any problems you'll be
[1734.72 - 1739.12] getting it out but if you can't
[1737.04 - 1740.96] poo because you need all this fiber then
[1739.12 - 1745.28] you have a problem
[1740.96 - 1746.88] a problem that you're using fiber as a
[1745.28 - 1749.44] tool
[1746.88 - 1751.68] because you can't go anymore because you
[1749.44 - 1753.60] actually have a physical problem going
[1751.68 - 1755.68] inside the body making it so you can't
[1753.60 - 1756.80] go to bathroom
[1755.68 - 1758.40] so then
[1756.80 - 1760.48] you might be somebody or anybody that
[1758.40 - 1762.16] ends up knocking on some doctors george
[1760.48 - 1764.40] is greater practitioner's door and read
[1762.16 - 1766.16] an article and it says don't juice
[1764.40 - 1768.24] because it minim it gets rid of the
[1766.16 - 1770.00] fiber and all of a sudden you're scared
[1768.24 - 1772.00] but the juicing is what fixes the
[1770.00 - 1774.24] problem inside the intestinal tract in
[1772.00 - 1776.08] the gut so that you can get peristaltic
[1774.24 - 1777.52] action to go to bathroom without having
[1776.08 - 1779.28] any fiber
[1777.52 - 1781.28] and be like someone who doesn't have a
[1779.28 - 1783.44] problem in their intestinal tract i know
[1781.28 - 1784.96] some people they can live off of donuts
[1783.44 - 1787.92] and they'll poo it out just fine they
[1784.96 - 1789.28] don't have any problems like fiber
[1787.92 - 1791.28] they're like what
[1789.28 - 1793.12] we need fiber for
[1791.28 - 1796.64] is that just a new age word they'll be
[1793.12 - 1799.12] like whatever i'm going to bathroom fine
[1796.64 - 1801.04] but does your health get worse if you're
[1799.12 - 1804.24] just on white bread yes for other
[1801.04 - 1807.12] reasons because you don't get protected
[1804.24 - 1809.28] by the antiviral compounds and the
[1807.12 - 1811.80] medicine and the trace mineral salt you
[1809.28 - 1813.52] don't get protected by the by the by the
[1811.80 - 1815.68] anthocyanins right there see the
[1813.52 - 1817.92] anthocyanins right there you don't get
[1815.68 - 1820.32] protected by the anthocyanins
[1817.92 - 1822.72] you see them right that's the purple you
[1820.32 - 1825.60] don't get protected by those those are
[1822.72 - 1827.68] the antioxidants those are the antiviral
[1825.60 - 1830.00] compounds antibacterial compounds and
[1827.68 - 1832.56] trace mineral salts
[1830.00 - 1835.20] so what you'll find with the mm-900 is
[1832.56 - 1838.08] it saves you money and the pulp comes
[1835.20 - 1839.68] out dry that's what happens the pulp
[1838.08 - 1841.36] comes out dry
[1839.68 - 1845.84] it's it's not
[1841.36 - 1847.52] it's not sopping wet you have a dry bowl
[1845.84 - 1849.20] got a dry ball
[1847.52 - 1851.76] link is in profile link is in the
[1849.20 - 1854.24] description on on the juicer it's coming
[1851.76 - 1857.20] down to the end of the sale
[1854.24 - 1858.72] and i can't express how important
[1857.20 - 1860.32] juicing is
[1858.72 - 1862.16] for somebody to stay healthy and if
[1860.32 - 1863.76] someone has talked out of juicing in
[1862.16 - 1865.60] their life
[1863.76 - 1868.96] use any juicer you have forget the
[1865.60 - 1871.68] mm-900 the mm-900 saves people money it
[1868.96 - 1873.84] squeezes every last drop it pulverizes
[1871.68 - 1877.12] like no other juicer does
[1873.84 - 1878.80] but if you have any juicer i'll take it
[1877.12 - 1881.60] i'm on board
[1878.80 - 1883.20] i'm on board keep the juicer you have
[1881.60 - 1885.12] if you have any juicer i don't care if
[1883.20 - 1887.04] it's a ten dollar juicer and it's got a
[1885.12 - 1888.32] crank on it and you're and you're doing
[1887.04 - 1890.56] a ten dollar juicer and you've got a
[1888.32 - 1892.80] crank on it i will be patting you on the
[1890.56 - 1894.88] back until you don't even get the mm-900
[1892.80 - 1897.92] fine just keep what you're doing because
[1894.88 - 1900.88] you're juicing and it's the juicing part
[1897.92 - 1902.56] yeah this is an incredible machine
[1900.88 - 1905.36] it saves you money you end up saved and
[1902.56 - 1908.40] it pays for itself and and basically you
[1905.36 - 1910.16] get into a dry ball of pulp and it and
[1908.40 - 1912.08] and you're now buying half the celery
[1910.16 - 1913.52] and half this and half that and if you
[1912.08 - 1915.20] want to juice something else like a
[1913.52 - 1917.12] carrot you're buying less carrots you're
[1915.20 - 1919.28] buying less cucumbers right but the
[1917.12 - 1920.80] point is in pomegranate the same thing
[1919.28 - 1924.40] you bring less pomegranate and it adds
[1920.80 - 1927.36] up adds up big time in the food prices
[1924.40 - 1928.96] are going up so this machine became like
[1927.36 - 1930.96] this blessing
[1928.96 - 1933.36] it became this blessing
[1930.96 - 1936.08] the mm-900 hds
[1933.36 - 1937.84] i endorsed it i endorsed the company
[1936.08 - 1939.12] because i know what it's doing and i
[1937.84 - 1940.80] know what it's doing for people but if
[1939.12 - 1942.16] you have any juicer you guys i stand
[1940.80 - 1944.00] behind it 100
[1942.16 - 1947.04] meaning like i'm on board you use the
[1944.00 - 1949.04] juicer you have just make juice please
[1947.04 - 1950.64] please i beg of you to make juice with
[1949.04 - 1952.88] the juicer you have you don't have to
[1950.64 - 1956.64] get the mm-900
[1952.88 - 1958.80] because i know how important juicing is
[1956.64 - 1963.44] if i don't have passion towards the
[1958.80 - 1965.76] juicing and if i don't have a mission
[1963.44 - 1968.00] towards the juicing how is it going to
[1965.76 - 1970.08] stay alive to keep people alive because
[1968.00 - 1973.04] there's always an attack
[1970.08 - 1975.76] to take the good down out there with
[1973.04 - 1977.68] celery juice don't add anything
[1975.76 - 1980.64] don't add anything i love how the pulp
[1977.68 - 1982.08] is dry i just love that it's my favorite
[1980.64 - 1984.16] it's my favorite thing
[1982.08 - 1986.72] it's barely it's damp it's it's
[1984.16 - 1988.80] incredible how that works right
[1986.72 - 1990.80] don't put any ice in there don't put any
[1988.80 - 1992.64] lemon in there don't put anything like
[1990.80 - 1995.44] that okay
[1992.64 - 1998.00] don't put ice don't put lemon
[1995.44 - 2000.56] don't put anything like that you want 16
[1998.00 - 2003.04] to 32 ounces i'm throwing it in a mug
[2000.56 - 2003.04] right now
[2003.44 - 2007.36] throw it in a glass mug to show you
[2008.64 - 2010.88] right
[2010.96 - 2016.40] always strain it
[2013.44 - 2018.24] 16 to 32 ounces
[2016.40 - 2019.20] right
[2018.24 - 2021.84] and
[2019.20 - 2024.00] empty stomach first thing in the morning
[2021.84 - 2025.52] it's herbal medicine
[2024.00 - 2028.88] that's what it is
[2025.52 - 2030.88] it's herbal medicine at its best and
[2028.88 - 2032.40] keep that in mind
[2030.88 - 2033.20] how long will it keep us see on tick
[2032.40 - 2034.40] tock
[2033.20 - 2036.80] i mean you could put it in the in the
[2034.40 - 2038.64] fridge for for a day
[2036.80 - 2040.72] you want to drink it right away but i've
[2038.64 - 2042.88] had celery juice in the fridge for three
[2040.72 - 2044.80] days and i've consumed it and still
[2042.88 - 2047.28] beats anything in the store that's in a
[2044.80 - 2049.12] bottle or anything
[2047.28 - 2051.68] so
[2049.12 - 2055.20] so why does julie really good question i
[2051.68 - 2057.12] want to answer that one it's fantastic
[2055.20 - 2058.16] fiber doesn't feed first of all julia
[2057.12 - 2059.76] want to answer that question but i want
[2058.16 - 2062.24] to talk about something fiber doesn't
[2059.76 - 2065.60] feed good bacteria
[2062.24 - 2068.16] fiber cannot be broken down
[2065.60 - 2071.04] it can't be consumed
[2068.16 - 2074.08] so you we need to know how that works
[2071.04 - 2076.56] that's a theory because you because the
[2074.08 - 2078.64] theorists in medicine and health they
[2076.56 - 2079.52] don't want to lose the fiber
[2078.64 - 2081.76] tune
[2079.52 - 2083.84] they want to sing the fiber tune over
[2081.76 - 2085.12] and over again like
[2083.84 - 2087.52] fiber
[2085.12 - 2089.12] yeah fiber is everything it's fiber
[2087.52 - 2090.88] right they don't want to lose that so
[2089.12 - 2092.56] all of a sudden now we've learned about
[2090.88 - 2094.88] there's good bacteria in the gut i bet
[2092.56 - 2096.48] you fiber has a lot to do with that what
[2094.88 - 2098.80] else right
[2096.48 - 2100.64] hey vitamin d is important for people i
[2098.80 - 2102.72] bet your fiber has everything to do with
[2100.64 - 2105.44] that vitamin d being important okay what
[2102.72 - 2107.68] else um people need vitamin c fiber i
[2105.44 - 2110.00] bet you is everything to do with that um
[2107.68 - 2112.88] people need it's fiber see they they
[2110.00 - 2114.56] just lump it all into each other without
[2112.88 - 2117.44] knowing why anybody's sick or how to
[2114.56 - 2121.12] heal right
[2117.44 - 2123.36] so fiber doesn't feed bacteria fiber
[2121.12 - 2126.56] gets discarded
[2123.36 - 2130.24] it gets discarded because it's waste and
[2126.56 - 2132.56] it doesn't have any nutrients in it
[2130.24 - 2134.32] that's how it works with fiber your body
[2132.56 - 2136.24] can't break it down can't digest it nor
[2134.32 - 2137.76] can bacteria can't break down and digest
[2136.24 - 2139.20] fiber
[2137.76 - 2141.28] it can't
[2139.20 - 2143.60] fiber stays fiber
[2141.28 - 2145.76] is what it does
[2143.60 - 2148.24] very important now
[2145.76 - 2150.32] but good bacteria
[2148.24 - 2153.44] feeds on
[2150.32 - 2154.48] the juice that cracked
[2153.44 - 2157.76] out
[2154.48 - 2159.76] of the pulp of something
[2157.76 - 2162.24] you bite a lemon
[2159.76 - 2165.44] you bite the lemon pulp you squeeze that
[2162.24 - 2169.28] lemon juice in that good bacteria
[2165.44 - 2173.44] will feed off of that lemon juice
[2169.28 - 2176.80] good bacteria feeds off of the juices of
[2173.44 - 2179.60] those important phytochemical compounds
[2176.80 - 2181.36] of those important vegetables and fruits
[2179.60 - 2185.60] and leafy greens and herbs
[2181.36 - 2187.84] good bacteria feeds off the juices
[2185.60 - 2190.16] you want to save any good bacteria you
[2187.84 - 2192.00] make sure you give them lots of juice
[2190.16 - 2193.44] that's how it works so there's a
[2192.00 - 2197.36] question about coffee i don't want to
[2193.44 - 2198.56] lose why does coffee move things
[2197.36 - 2200.48] there's a question right here i think it
[2198.56 - 2203.12] was on youtube or facebook why does
[2200.48 - 2205.84] coffee move things
[2203.12 - 2209.28] coffee moves things because coffee
[2205.84 - 2211.76] stimulates your adrenals
[2209.28 - 2213.92] caffeine makes your adrenals dump
[2211.76 - 2216.56] epinephrine into your bloodstream
[2213.92 - 2218.56] epinephrine is fight or flight
[2216.56 - 2222.32] and you have to poo
[2218.56 - 2222.32] while you're either getting killed
[2222.48 - 2226.96] or you're running from someone trying to
[2225.20 - 2229.20] kill you
[2226.96 - 2231.36] see how it works
[2229.20 - 2233.92] when you get scared
[2231.36 - 2237.52] you your pants
[2233.92 - 2240.32] there's a reason why that term exists
[2237.52 - 2242.80] when you get scared out of your mind you
[2240.32 - 2245.68]  your pants
[2242.80 - 2247.84] you pee your pants
[2245.68 - 2251.60] the reason why you pee
[2247.84 - 2253.04] and poo your pants when you get scared
[2251.60 - 2256.24] to death
[2253.04 - 2258.16] is because that's an adrenaline reaction
[2256.24 - 2260.56] to empty you
[2258.16 - 2262.48] so you can have more ability to fight
[2260.56 - 2266.00] and run
[2262.48 - 2266.00] someone comes to attack you
[2266.48 - 2271.44] you need to evacuate
[2269.44 - 2274.72] animals in the wild
[2271.44 - 2276.40] eliminate everything inside of them
[2274.72 - 2278.24] before the deer
[2276.40 - 2280.80] you chase a deer
[2278.24 - 2283.20] if a wolf chases a deer the deer will
[2280.80 - 2285.76] empty out its entire
[2283.20 - 2287.84] innards basically
[2285.76 - 2290.32] all the deer poop will go flying out of
[2287.84 - 2292.08] the deer as it's running it's fight or
[2290.32 - 2293.68] flight
[2292.08 - 2296.16] we have it too
[2293.68 - 2297.76] when you drink caffeine you told your
[2296.16 - 2300.00] adrenals
[2297.76 - 2303.12] were fight or flight you're either gonna
[2300.00 - 2306.24] get killed or be killed or run
[2303.12 - 2308.08] kill or be killed or whatever
[2306.24 - 2311.12] fight or flight whatever
[2308.08 - 2312.96] and so coffee all that caffeine makes
[2311.12 - 2315.04] the adrenals go oh my god there's a
[2312.96 - 2318.88] problem oh i gotta go to the bathroom
[2315.04 - 2318.88] now i gotta do my bowel movement
[2319.76 - 2324.84] caffeine's a poison too
[2322.56 - 2329.36] and poisons need to be
[2324.84 - 2329.36] eliminated so it's a combination of that
[2331.52 - 2334.72] you know what's interesting about
[2332.72 - 2338.08] medical medium information
[2334.72 - 2338.08] thank god you guys know this
[2339.36 - 2342.08] but it's information you won't hear
[2340.72 - 2344.56] anywhere else and
[2342.08 - 2347.52] and melton said that
[2344.56 - 2347.52] milton just said
[2347.84 - 2351.76] this info you won't hear anywhere else
[2351.84 - 2356.96] i'm honored truly i am
[2354.88 - 2358.40] warms my heart you know that it really
[2356.96 - 2360.72] does
[2358.40 - 2362.72] and people steal it and they won't cite
[2360.72 - 2365.36] it back trust me that will be all
[2362.72 - 2367.04] through the vegan movement in about
[2365.36 - 2369.84] the vegans especially like a vegan
[2367.04 - 2371.20] movement people not vegans
[2369.84 - 2373.20] but like
[2371.20 - 2375.12] the people trying to get to the top of
[2373.20 - 2377.36] the vegan movement you know to become a
[2375.12 - 2379.76] speaker or a book writer or whatever it
[2377.36 - 2382.48] is right it's happened the last 35 years
[2379.76 - 2384.88] they love taking medical medium tidbits
[2382.48 - 2386.16] injecting it into the vegan movement
[2384.88 - 2389.12] and then telling other people don't
[2386.16 - 2391.04] listen to that medical medium
[2389.12 - 2393.20] that's classic actually with the vegan
[2391.04 - 2395.36] movement
[2393.20 - 2397.68] i think you know what happens is that
[2395.36 - 2399.36] and again i'm pro-vegan pro-plant-based
