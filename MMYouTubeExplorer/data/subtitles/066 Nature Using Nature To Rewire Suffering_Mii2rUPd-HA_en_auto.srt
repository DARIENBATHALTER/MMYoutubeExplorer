nature heals

27
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:28,840
us nature comes in all shapes and sizes

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
what that means is maybe someone has

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,280
just a little tiny

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,479
backyard maybe they have a little tiny

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,520
front yard maybe they only have one

32
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,479
window in their house or their apartment

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,399
or dwelling somewhere and they can just

34
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:49,079
see one tree and then once in a while

35
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,240
they see a bird land on that tree or a

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,880
squirrel go up the

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:00,560
tree nature can be as small as being on

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,439
a rooftop in the city watching a pigeon

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,960
on another rooftop and the nature could

40
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,479
be a lot bigger than that it could be

41
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,319
somebody who's always outdoors and

42
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,319
taking hikes taking walks every day out

43
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,160
there by the ocean standing on the

44
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,160
beach camping out by a

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,480
lake nature can come in all shapes and

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,120
sizes but do we know what nature is

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,959
really doing for

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,480
us yeah it's winding us down helping us

49
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,160
relax

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,200
maybe shifting our train of thought

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,239
giving us a break some

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,599
relaxation but it could be doing a lot

53
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,239
more for you than you even know and if

54
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,840
you harness it properly or just right

55
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,360
you can get a lot more out of it when it

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,400
comes down to Nature anything and

57
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,680
everything

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,840
goes it can be simplistic it can be just

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,400
listening to a cricket and each individ

60
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,640
ual thing you experience in nature does

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,959
something a little different to vastly

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,879
different for

63
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,840
you if you're in the wilderness and

64
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,799
you're camped out and a Sasquatch walks

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
by you're a nature and it's going to do

66
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,400
something for you it's probably going to

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,440
scare the hell out of you but

68
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
something's going to happen because

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,879
there it is a creature in the

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,080
woods same thing if you're in the

71
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:34,959
wilderness and you see a bear walk by

72
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,400
or if you see a squirrel on a branch

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,879
they all do different things for us in

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,400
different ways they ignite healing they

75
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,040
ignite

76
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,799
emotion they help our soul so let's

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,959
start heading into it right

78
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,879
now life can be really toxic down here

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,640
on Earth we can get exposed to a lot of

80
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,000
different things not just

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,799
toxins not just different things that

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,720
are poisonous to us but different things

83
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,400
that are poisonous to us yeah what that

84
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,560
means is other people's emotions psychic

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,439
attacks any kind of betrayal or trust

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,919
breakage jealousy issues that you run

87
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,160
into people with stress all the

88
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,080
different moving parts to be here on

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,720
planet Earth Financial stress everything

90
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,840
stress it's here this place can be

91
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,759
really toxic so there has to be a flip

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,440
side there has to be something that's

93
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,680
working in our favor that we can utilize

94
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,520
to balance this madness down here

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,520
there's experiences down here in planet

96
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,199
Earth that hurt our

97
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,720
heads it just hurts our heads lots of

98
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,039
annoyances things that shouldn't be

99
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,160
happening but they just are there's a

100
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,199
lot of Darkness on planet Earth you see

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,240
it out there all kinds of Wars for what

102
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,280
reason all kinds of different problems

103
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,960
out there for what reason

104
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,280
and then the monetary system and then

105
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,320
everything else including the Illuminati

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,800
and what's happening there all of it

107
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,240
puppeteering and controlling everything

108
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,560
offer greed and chaos and sickness and

109
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,160
the system it's set up to make people

110
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,840
sick we know that already so while all

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,680
this is happening out there and the

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,759
world is spinning and all these

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,680
different poisons and toxins are

114
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,880
traveling through the air and their

115
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,240
inner hands on on us we breathe them in

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,759
we eat them and then all the different

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,240
stress factors involved we have to

118
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,919
utilize everything we

119
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,680
have what constraints and what system is

120
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,720
a toad living with what constraints and

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,039
what system is a bee living with a

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,479
squirrel a flower growing a river

123
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,720
flowing what are these held back with

124
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:04,840
what kind of roles are placed on these

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,599
animals insects that have any roles are

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,479
they worried about a monetary system are

127
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,840
they worried about some kind of stress

128
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,599
factor are they worried about someone

129
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,919

worried about really anything they're

134
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,919
just doing what they need to do and they

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,639
have an energy and a frequency they're

136
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,000
doing it what's governing

137
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,639
nature the laws of nature that's what's

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,880
governing nature they live by the laws

139
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:46,880
of nature it's not the laws of men it's

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:50,000
the laws of nature huge

141
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,919
difference some say the laws of nature

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
are

143
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,240
harsher you know you see it on

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,639
YouTube you see it in the movies you see

145
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,360
a shark come out of the water

146
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,199
grab onto a

147
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,400
seal pull the poor thing down into the

148
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,400
water and blood flowing

149
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,759
everywhere you see a lion chasing after

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,199
an antelope taking it down and ripping

151
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,080
it apart you see a

152
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,919
crocodile taking a swim going after a

153
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,319
whole flock of birds just gobbling them

154
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,560
up feathers everywhere you see nature

155
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,759
portray it like that and yes it's there

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,680
it

157
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:38,240
happens but our world that governs us is

158
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:42,400
a lot more scarier and more

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,840
evil it's actually evil in so many ways

160
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
and it's set up like that nature is

161
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,080
nature it's dog eat

162
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,919
dog but life on planet Earth for

163
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:59,599
humankind is dog Slaughter dog a tiger

164
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,240
chases a rabbit for survival

165
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,560
it's

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,479
survival a human does a diabolical thing

167
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,039
to another human or group of humans or

168
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,960
large massive group of humans for sport

169
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,960
and hatred and

170
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,400
jealousy but in animal trying to survive

171
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:24,520
out there like a wolf or a group of

172
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,080
wolves hunting mice in a cold field

173
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,000
before winter comes there's no jealousy

174
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,800
there's no hatred

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
it's just get a mouse in the stomach to

176
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:39,000
survive the

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:43,440
winter get a mouse in your mouth chew it

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,080
up swallow it so life can

179
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,160
continue big difference the greed the

180
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,920
hatred the jealousy the Betrayal the

181
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,519
trust breakage on this

182
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,320
planet is getting to its

183
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,440
maximum it's

184
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,079
climbing it's

185
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,839
elevating and that gets into our

186
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:08,760
Consciousness it can contaminate us it

187
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:10,760
can poison our brains poison our minds

188
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,399
or Consciousness or subconsciousness

189
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,560
poison our

190
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,519
souls and so we need something to shift

191
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,120
that we need to fill the

192
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,000
garden we need to pull the poisonous

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,680
weeds out of the garden and we need to

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,279
fill the garden with edible

195
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,079
plants we need something to visualize

196
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,399
something to see something that could be

197
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,480
really

198
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,680
healing like maybe a

199
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,440
worm a worm can be very healing if you

200
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,600
take a little shovel and you're digging

201
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,120
it in the garden or you're just digging

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,120
in the leaves somewhere and you see an

203
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,399
earthworm pop out and squiggle

204
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,440
away there's something that happens when

205
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,040
you see that worm squiggling

206
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,320
away your soul

207
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,440
a little portal in your soul just opens

208
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,640
right

209
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,000
up your brain cells and neurons start to

210
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,399
receive the information you're seeing an

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,240
imprint is being made

212
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,079
instantly and as you're looking at that

213
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,240
earthworm a miracle is

214
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,519
happening information that's sitting

215
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,600
inside your brain and your neurons

216
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,680
starts to move information that may not

217
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,160
be good that's sitting in the emotional

218
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,160
centers of the brain like experiences

219
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
stressful experiences old ones too going

220
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,079
all the way back new ones that were just

221
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,160
the other day or some that have been

222
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:47,600
PTSD or created PTSD long ago and they

223
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,000
just surface every now and then and

224
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,440
Trigger those start to move along

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,360
too and it's not just one

226
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,720
earthworm it can be a potato

227
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,720
bug it can be a any kind of creepy

228
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,399
Crawley that you see move around in the

229
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,399
dirt or under the

230
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,279
leaves and then you hear a flutter a

231
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:16,560
little flutter and it's a bird it's

232
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:19,360
moving pretty quick there it is it lands

233
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,600
on a branch you look up at it and take a

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,959
good look at it and have respect for it

235
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,880
what happens is that in our busy lives

236
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,440
these things become old hat

237
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,680
old hat we just don't respect it like we

238
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,399
should and we don't really receive what

239
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,480
it really is and what it could do for us

240
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,480
we ignore it sometimes too there's

241
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,240
people out there that maybe with a

242
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,720
family member or a friend they go on a

243
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,079
hike but they're not really seeing

244
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,560
anything they're not really taking it in

245
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,240
digesting it it's helping them it's

246
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,040
helping them heal but they're not taking

247
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,240
taking it all in and receiving it they

248
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,800
got other things on their mind or they

249
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,639
feel it's just underneath them beneath

250
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:16,279
them it's not important compared to

251
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,600
life but it is important and it is

252
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:23,120
critical to see and understand when you

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,680
lean up against a tree and you touch it

254
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,839
and place your hand on that tree realize

255
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,320
something that there is water living

256
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,320
water filled with minerals coming up

257
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,720
from the

258
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,600
earth and going up traveling up right

259
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,760
behind that bark

260
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,399
layer so when you put your hand on that

261
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:51,040
tree that's its life force that's its

262
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,839
heartbeat the tree's heartbeat isn't in

263
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,959
the middle of the tree the tree's

264
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,800
heartbeat is actually just under that

265
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:03,279
thin veil of bark

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,279
it's right there you're feeling it's

267
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,560
blood you're feeling it's

268
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,160
fluid you're feeling it's living force

269
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
and living

270
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,920
Source something happens to that

271
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,680
tree if that bark is cut all the way

272
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,199
around the tree even if it's just an

273
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,880
inch into the tree all the way around it

274
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:30,120
can't get that drink anymore it'll still

275
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,360
look green but eventually the tree will

276
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,079
just die and all the leaves will turn

277
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:39,199
brown and crumble and eventually just

278
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,880
fall off because life force is rushing

279
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,760
up through the underneath layer of the

280
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,240
bark so when people hug trees and they

281
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,759
like to hug trees and it's very healing

282
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,320
and it's good for them what's really

283
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,880
happening is they're wrapping their body

284
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,519
around the trees's life force which is

285
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,399
just underneath the bark

286
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,320
but the key is to really get this to

287
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,639
settle in and work for you when you

288
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,000
touch a tree or be near a tree is to

289
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,759
know that's what's

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,440
happening because a rewiring

291
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,360
occurs nature

292
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,480
rewires and that includes every aspect

293
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
of

294
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,880
nature if you're standing next to that

295
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,120
tree and you know that that water is

296
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,800
Flowing that that's the veins of the

297
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,639
tree and it's flowing upward and that

298
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,279
tree is drinking that water for its

299
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,600
survival and you become conscious of it

300
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,399
aware of it then you go to the next

301
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,160
level it's not just looking at a tree

302
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,920
it's more than that it's understanding

303
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,680
the tree's existence and life force and

304
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,800
when you understand that the tree will

305
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,600
connect to

306
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,399
you A tree can connect to a human

307
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,240
being why would a tree grow

308
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,480
fruit why would a tree grow avocado

309
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
one of the reasons A Tree Grows avocados

310
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,040
it isn't just for the squirrels to eat

311
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,360
them and raccoons to eat them when they

312
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,079
fall to the

313
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:17,759
ground it's for humans to eat and

314
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:20,000
survive that fruit is grown for

315
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,079
humankind so think about that for a

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,240
minute that tree is doing us more than

317
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:29,880
just a favor it's supporting our life

318
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,639
force it's giving us a food a

319
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,360
staple when that tree grows a

320
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,440
pomegranate it's giving us that food in

321
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,480
that

322
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:44,079
staple and so the food is growing for us

323
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,639
the tree is growing it for us it knows

324
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,720
then it's

325
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,639
eaters trees no it's eaters when a

326
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,720
squirrel is on that tree trying to take

327
00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:00,319
down a pomegranate the tree knows that

328
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,279
it's growing a food for that

329
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:06,040
squirrel and so there's a symbiotic

330
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,279
relationship

331
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,199
developing it's always there so when you

332
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,360
go up to a tree the tree knows that

333
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,360
you're part of

334
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,759
everything and then when you become

335
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:23,240
aware of this though the rewiring really

336
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,319
kicks in and deep healing occurs because

337
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,920
you're not just thinking about oh what

338
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:30,279
do I got going on today what am I doing

339
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,759
today oh my God my stress is so bad oh

340
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm going to stand next to this tree and

341
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,959
absorb this nature but wow lots going on

342
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,000
the minute you switch out of that and

343
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,440
you're just like wow the water is coming

344
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,560
from the earth it's going up the tree

345
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,279
the bark I can put my hand on the side

346
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:52,079
of the bark I'm touching its vein path

347
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,120
its artery path and when you do that the

348
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,720
wiring and the rewiring just starts to

349
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,639
go into high gear versus just low gear

350
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,520
now anything in nature helps to rewire

351
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,480
even looking at a painting of nature is

352
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,959
healing there's a lot of different

353
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,640
people out there different kinds of

354
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,760
people some people are

355
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,280
compassionate some people are just blood

356
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,760
suckers some people are just energy

357
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,640
suckers some people it's all about what

358
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,360
I can give you if you give me something

359
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,559
it's all about trading some people it's

360
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,360
just all about

361
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,559
bartering barter and barter and

362
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,000
barter I'm not judging any of these

363
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,679
people or any of the people that live

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,520
like a certain way or any way they want

365
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:46,720
to live that's our freedom it's our free

366
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,559
will but a lot of people out there like

367
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,559
to draw from

368
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,559
people energy

369
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:58,960
suckers they devour energy off the

370
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:02,240
person and what happens in nature it

371
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,919
doesn't work like that that grasshopper

372
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,320
is not going to take from you it's not

373
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,240
going to draw anything from you it's

374
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,280
going to do the opposite it's going to

375
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,720
offer

376
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,280
something that Cricket is not going to

377
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:23,640
draw from you and take from you it's not

378
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:26,400
a blood sucker it's not a emotional well

379
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,440
Digger it's not anything of the

380
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,120
sort it's there to offer

381
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,840
something a squirrel is not going to

382
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,919
take from you unless you want to give it

383
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,960
a

384
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,960
nut unless you want to hand it a nut out

385
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,480
of your own hand which is really healing

386
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,919
for a lot of people but look out the

387
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,600
squirrel might get spooked and get

388
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
squirrly and take a little nibble out of

389
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,799
your hand and take a little bite they

390
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,919
got to be

391
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:55,440
cautious but a squirrel might want to

392
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,520
get a peanut from you but the squirrel

393
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,320
gives you something back in return for

394
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,120
that peanut squirrel's not going to be

395
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,280
an energy

396
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,320
sucker a squirrel is going to be an

397
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,559
energy Giver in a way that's much

398
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,559
different you might not feel

399
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,000
sparkierdust of

400
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,559
reasons that you're going to be

401
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,880
rewired your brain is going to be

402
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,039
functioning

403
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,360
differently just from that experience

404
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,520
with a squirrel just looking at the

405
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:34,799
squirrel on a tree watching its pattern

406
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,840
what it does how it rubs its face with

407
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,679
its little Claws and

408
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,200
hands how it looks around real fast and

409
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,000
then takes off chases other squirrels

410
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,320
and plays all around the tree I remember

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,360
when I was younger taking a walk through

412
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,720
the woods in an area I've never been I

413
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,760
climbed up a hill and there was some

414
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,760
water running

415
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,159
it was a spring and it was

416
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,400
flowing now the miracle thing was we

417
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,000
were in a

418
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,919
drought there was no water really all

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,720
the ponds and lakes were down at their

420
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:18,760
lowest didn't rain for

421
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:21,679
months birds were searching for water

422
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,080
everywhere it was not a good time it was

423
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,000
a serious

424
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,960
drought but there was just water flowing

425
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,720
down this little Hill

426
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:38,120
it was miraculous just to see it and to

427
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,400
listen to it I sat down Sat by it and I

428
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:45,799
listened to it and I watched it

429
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:48,799
flow and S so said to me this is healing

430
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,400
your soul I said well it feels like it's

431
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,520
healing my soul there's something

432
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,240
happening here and so so said no

433
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:01,400
listen every single

434
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Trickle and everything you see is

435
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,799
forming a memory and imprint that will

436
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,440
be there forever and you will never

437
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,640
forget it and it's entering through a

438
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,279
passageway into your soul I'll never

439
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,640
forget that I'll never forget that

440
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:22,000
moment it's with me in this lifetime

441
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,559
forever and spirit of compassion tells

442
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,159
me I'm taking it far beyond this

443
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,640
lifetime it's going to be in there as a

444
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,480
protect Ive

445
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,799
measure a healing measure to help me

446
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,159
stay

447
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,760
strong and that's how powerful nature

448
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
is if you're somebody you're not afraid

449
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,039
of

450
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,919
bees because you're just not afraid

451
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,200
maybe you've never had a

452
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,919
reaction maybe you never even had a bee

453
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,799
sting before and you see a bee on a

454
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,240
flower and you drop down to the ground

455
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:02,200
and you just look at it maybe it's a

456
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,799
honey maybe and it's on the top of a

457
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,039
dandelion

458
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:09,760
flower and you're listening to it and

459
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,120
you're watching it is gathering up all

460
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,799
that

461
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,600
pollen and you take a good look and you

462
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:21,039
listen and it enters into the soul deep

463
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,880
into the soul and you can see Blades of

464
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,080
grass going around the dandelion flower

465
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,240
I can see the bee effortlessly just

466
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,960
floating up and down

467
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,919
and then it decides to take off it's

468
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,600
looking for another flower

469
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:40,480
somewhere at the same time here comes

470
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,840
another bee lands on the same flower

471
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,200
that one just

472
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:49,240
left it's these memories these

473
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,360
experiences these references they become

474
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:56,240
references that hold a lot of power and

475
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,039
our healing and maybe you don't have

476
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,679
access to any of it and you're just

477
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,679
sitting inside the house and you're

478
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,159
looking at a

479
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,080
painting there's power in even a

480
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:13,200
naturistic painting that you can see

481
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,240
flowers and trees and blue skies and

482
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,440
water very

483
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,880
healing healing on the brain

484
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,440
subconsciousness the Consciousness the

485
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,760
soul mentally emotionally spiritually

486
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,520
and even

487
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,760
physically even if you're somebody that

488
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,720
that's in a city or you're chronically

489
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,200
sick and you can't get outside it's too

490
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,559
hard or you don't have the resources but

491
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,120
you can look out of a window and you can

492
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:47,440
see a bird passing by you could see it

493
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:50,400
rain in the raindrops hit the window see

494
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,559
the raindrops landing on the grass or on

495
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,480
the trees or in the parking

496
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,200
lot

497
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,159
anything anything in nature is helpful

498
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,799
and and

499
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:04,480
healing watching a cloud roll in if

500
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,279
you're somebody that can go outside and

501
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,720
lay on a lawn or in a park on the ground

502
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,520
or a grassy

503
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,760
field and you can look up at the sky and

504
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,600
see the dragon flies and maybe that's

505
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,200
not the type of season or the time of

506
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,840
season that's happening right now for

507
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,399
you but maybe you'll get that chance and

508
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,399
you'll see the dragon flies Roll On

509
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:29,760
by as they

510
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:32,000
go dragon flies

511
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,000
highly connected to

512
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,440
humankind and help the brain heal and

513
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,360
the Soul heal in many different

514
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,919
ways and so dragon flies going by and

515
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,640
then birds flying up high in the

516
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,679
sky and trees

517
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:55,440
rustling and do other things besides C

518
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,039
make sure you listen and hear and then

519
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,480
feel if you have the opportunity to just

520
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,799
sit there on the

521
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,799
ground and just play with little twigs

522
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:09,440
and pull grass up from the earth and

523
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,919
touch the

524
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,200
grass just that alone is so healing and

525
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,679
so powerful creates references that help

526
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,360
battle chronic

527
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:24,399
illness and help battle emotional abuse

528
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,159
emotional pain betrayal any kind of

529
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,679
problems that have happened in your life

530
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:33,760
being let down trust

531
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:37,240
breakage these very Tools in nature help

532
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,720
to reverse that help to heal it

533
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,399
especially if it's happening on a

534
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,600
continual basis maybe you're in a

535
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,679
relationship and there's a lot of

536
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,080
distrust in the relationship betrayal

537
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
and all kinds of

538
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,480
aggravation compromises that are

539
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,559
happening between the relationship for

540
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,360
some

541
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,080
reason and so it's a constant battle or

542
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,080
a constant ARG arent or fight getting

543
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,440
into nature in

544
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,520
between critical to clear the Sate or

545
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,640
help clear the Sate help ease things

546
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,080
especially if you feel like your soul is

547
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,039
taking on water it's like a boat out

548
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,880
there and the waters get rough and

549
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,200
there's a storm coming and the boat's

550
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,200
rocking and water's coming onto the boat

551
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,440
it's taking on water and it's feeling

552
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,279
heavy even when a soul can feel heavy

553
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,399
feeling like it's been beaten or

554
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:40,120
battered by distress alone or anything

555
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:42,000
happening in your life nature is a

556
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,080
weapon against

557
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,080
it nature can help get that boat

558
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:53,640
floating get the Seas to

559
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,480
come get the water out of the boat when

560
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,440
we go through life we feel like we're on

561
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,760
somebody else's playing field

562
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,840
let's face it it's that difficult down

563
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,440
here and we're on someone else's playing

564
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:12,320
field out there when you get into nature

565
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,760
it's on your playing field now nature is

566
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,600
your playing

567
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:21,240
field you get to be in nature in

568
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,279
peace you get to see it feel it take it

569
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,600
in for what it is evildoers on the

570
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:30,200
planet don't want you Tak it in

571
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,640
nature they just want to destroy nature

572
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,760
they do it all the time or they just

573
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,520
want to withhold nature that's why most

574
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:43,120
of the planet isn't accessible to people

575
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,720
meaning it's restricted land it's off

576
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,240
limits you're allowed to play in Parks

577
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,320
you're allowed to take hikes in Parks

578
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,919
visit national parks and state parks but

579
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,960
there's so much land and so much nature

580
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,279
people are not allowed to enjoy or see

581
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,559
it's it's controlled it's kept from

582
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,720
people but you don't need to do the big

583
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,000
nature thing if it's not something that

584
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,320
you have time for resources or energy

585
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,559
for it can be as simple as your own yard

586
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,600
your own backyard your friend's backyard

587
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:21,600
anywhere anyhow it could be this small

588
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,399
little tiny Island not an island out in

589
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,200
the sea but an island near your house or

590
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,760
your apartment meaning a little spot

591
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,440
that has a few trees trees and some

592
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,600
grass and if you sat there just for a

593
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,760
few minutes even for 3 minutes you can

594
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,480
take in what nature offers and you might

595
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,799
see something that surprises you you

596
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,960
might see an insect or a bird or a hawk

597
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:49,559
fly by and that's the power of nature no

598
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,200
matter what we can use it for our own

599
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,519
benefit whenever we need it we can look

600
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,640
in the sky we can take a deep breath we

601
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:02,159
can breathe in air into our lungs we can

602
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,440
connect to the water sources around us

603
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,480
to the Lakes the rivers the oceans and

604
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,799
maybe only once a year you get to an

605
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,200
ocean and you can walk on that sand and

606
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,039
experience like the medical medium waves

607
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,279
on a beach

608
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,440
meditation and you can experience that

609
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:21,200
once and then you have that reference

610
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,720
and it stays with you a lifetime and it

611
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,679
stays in your soul and it sits there and

612
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,840
it doesn't leave nobody can take it from

613
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,440
you it can't be

614
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,880
stolen it can't leave you you're not

615
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,919
going to get let down you're not going

616
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,120
to get your trust broken that experience

617
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,080
is going to sit inside your soul and

618
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,559
your neurons and your brain and your

619
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,880
emotional centers of the brain for a

620
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,200
lifetime and Beyond and it's going to

621
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,919
help protect you and help you heal

622
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,679
nature is so powerful for healing that

623
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,200
if you couldn't get out and you can only

624
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,279
watch it on the computer or television

625
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,760

626
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,519

same nature fights

685
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,480
arrogance and I know deep down inside it

692
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,320
free animals that may have been tricked

693
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,440
by a snare

694
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,559
