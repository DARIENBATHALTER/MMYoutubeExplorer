[0.72 - 6.00] I'm from Florida I live in Germany on
[2.76 - 8.24] the North Sea I am from Sydney Australia
[6.00 - 11.12] I live in New York no I live in Los
[8.24 - 14.36] Angeles I thank Anthony with all of my
[11.12 - 17.48] heart we are so grateful for the books
[14.36 - 20.12] the information everything that you put
[17.48 - 21.56] out there I'm so glad I jble across you
[20.12 - 24.76] I feel like everything happens for a
[21.56 - 27.49] reason we didn't have a future before so
[24.76 - 31.36] now the world is our oyster
