[1.28 - 5.08] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[3.20 - 7.08] listening to the medical medium radio
[5.08 - 9.84] show where each week I talk about the
[7.08 - 12.20] most advanced healing information and
[9.84 - 14.76] secrets about health much of which is
[12.20 - 16.68] not found anywhere else and is decades
[14.76 - 18.92] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[16.68 - 21.56] always said who has 10 or 20 or 30 years
[18.92 - 22.92] to wait to answers to their illnesses
[21.56 - 24.68] someone said to me the other day they
[22.92 - 27.68] said you know I had to wait 20 years to
[24.68 - 30.68] figure out what caused my Hashimoto
[27.68 - 33.12] thyroiditis 20 years and and the person
[30.68 - 35.40] said to me well you know I was told it
[33.12 - 38.00] was my body attacking itself so I was
[35.40 - 40.60] convinced my body was working against me
[38.00 - 42.56] all those years and it was something I
[40.60 - 44.48] never forgot every morning I woke up
[42.56 - 47.72] this person said to me every morning
[44.48 - 50.68] they woke up they felt well oh my God
[47.72 - 54.12] how further how much further did my body
[50.68 - 56.60] go to attack itself like is there more
[54.12 - 58.44] damage being done um is something being
[56.60 - 61.80] done about it and it was just nothing
[58.44 - 65.08] but but fear and worry for 20 years and
[61.80 - 67.24] I felt terrible I felt terrible that
[65.08 - 69.76] this person had to go through this and
[67.24 - 70.88] not know Advanced information I couldn't
[69.76 - 72.36] find it and they couldn't find it
[70.88 - 74.40] anywhere else they said there was no one
[72.36 - 76.80] talking about it no one ever said the
[74.40 - 79.16] real cause of Hashimoto thyroiditis
[76.80 - 82.48] anywhere nobody talked about it wasn't
[79.16 - 84.40] written anywhere wasn't in any books and
[82.48 - 86.48] this person was you know an ADV you know
[84.40 - 89.00] Health person where you know lots of
[86.48 - 91.52] lots of books you know had like you know
[89.00 - 93.44] 200 different Health books and you know
[91.52 - 95.68] read all kinds of Articles was up to
[93.44 - 97.52] date with the the newest information
[95.68 - 99.08] from you know from doctors that are
[97.52 - 103.68] putting out information that are well
[99.08 - 106.32] known you name it and just had no idea
[103.68 - 109.24] that the body doesn't attack itself so
[106.32 - 111.12] so when I mean 10 20 30 years ahead of
[109.24 - 113.68] what's B basically what's out there and
[111.12 - 116.40] do you have 10 20 30 years to wait to
[113.68 - 118.88] have answers I'm serious Spirit serious
[116.40 - 120.52] about this now it's no joke when someone
[118.88 - 122.76] actually has to go through through that
[120.52 - 125.16] have you gone through that at all
[122.76 - 126.72] because a lot of people are so this
[125.16 - 129.60] person was like you know I'm relieved to
[126.72 - 131.72] know that my body is actually defending
[129.60 - 133.24] itself it's defending itself against a
[131.72 - 134.64] pathogen called Epstein bar that's what
[133.24 - 137.24] enters into the thyroid causing
[134.64 - 139.24] Hashimoto's thyroiditis and this
[137.24 - 141.00] person's like thank God I know now and
[139.24 - 142.76] now I can do something about it I could
[141.00 - 144.88] take care of myself I could knock out
[142.76 - 146.56] the Epstein bar I could work on healing
[144.88 - 148.80] I can move forward I can get past this I
[146.56 - 152.12] can get off a thyroid medication I could
[148.80 - 154.64] move past all of this and and and most
[152.12 - 157.16] importantly I know that my body is not
[154.64 - 159.04] attacking itself that was just told to
[157.16 - 160.80] me because no one had answers so the
[159.04 - 162.16] blame had to go on the person's body
[160.80 - 165.12] that's how Medical Research Medical
[162.16 - 167.52] Science works so as I said before do you
[165.12 - 169.20] have 10 years to to learn this no you
[167.52 - 171.08] know you have to learn this you have to
[169.20 - 173.00] know this now if you just logged on and
[171.08 - 175.84] this is your first show you know pick up
[173.00 - 180.16] my book learn about it now um you know
[175.84 - 181.72] get the answers and uh and and and yeah

[183.80 - 187.24] dollars I mean tens of thousands of
[185.84 - 188.84] dollars sometimes hundreds of thousands
[187.24 - 190.68] of dollars trying to get answers going
[188.84 - 193.56] to Clinic to Clinic traveling around

[252.44 - 257.48] extremely common their true causes are
[255.28 - 258.92] still largely unknown until these
[257.48 - 261.52] conditions are properly understood
[258.92 - 263.84] healing will be limited you know today I
[261.52 - 266.16] will reveal the truth behind common a
[263.84 - 267.60] lot of common ey health issues I don't
[266.16 - 268.84] know how many I'm going to be able to
[267.60 - 271.48] cover but I'm going to cover as many as
[268.84 - 273.88] I can we're always going to do another
[271.48 - 275.12] show on every topic I do that's that's
[273.88 - 277.04] the plan we're going to make sure we
[275.12 - 279.04] cover all kinds of aspects of things
[277.04 - 281.92] that you know I wasn't able to cover
[279.04 - 284.60] during different shows so remember to go
[281.92 - 287.88] to my website medicalmedium.com I offer
[284.60 - 290.64] the free healing path um we put hundreds
[287.88 - 292.88] of hours I put over 100 hours into it

[305.84 - 311.24] everything by listening to it once
[307.84 - 312.88] because even when I listen to it again I
[311.24 - 314.32] go oh my god I didn't even know I can't
[312.88 - 317.44] even believe I said that meaning I
[314.32 - 320.00] didn't even know that I forgot or I
[317.44 - 321.52] missed I missed it I can't believe I put
[320.00 - 323.60] that in there cuz I was getting
[321.52 - 325.88] information from Spirit putting it in
[323.60 - 329.72] into the recordings so when I hear it
[325.88 - 331.36] back I'm like whoa and and so make sure
[329.72 - 332.84] that you listen to it a couple of times
[331.36 - 334.60] take your time you know maybe over the
[332.84 - 337.80] summer or something try to listen to a
[334.60 - 340.08] couple of the recordings the audios and
[337.80 - 341.88] um and and because you're going to start
[340.08 - 343.68] you know ingesting and digesting
[341.88 - 346.40] different things that you you didn't
[343.68 - 348.84] hear or you might have missed or or you
[346.40 - 351.32] need it to hear again I mean it's it's
[348.84 - 354.28] it's a great resource and it's it's
[351.32 - 356.64] really supportive um I've dedicated my
[354.28 - 359.56] life to helping people and I'm here to
[356.64 - 361.52] help you guys we're talking about we're
[359.56 - 364.56] talking about Eye Health today so you
[361.52 - 367.56] know when it comes down to eyes it
[364.56 - 370.92] really comes down to antioxidants that's
[367.56 - 372.52] where that word matters antioxidants
[370.92 - 374.84] what's an antioxidant really it's a
[372.52 - 377.72] phytochemical a group of phytochemicals
[374.84 - 379.68] that actually stop you from dying that's
[377.72 - 381.72] what they do they stop you from dying
[379.68 - 386.16] they stop you from
[381.72 - 388.32] aging they stop you from from
[386.16 - 390.44] deteriorating that's what antioxidants
[388.32 - 394.96] do think about that you know because
[390.44 - 397.28] what do we do we oxidize we oxidize like
[394.96 - 400.36] things do like things
[397.28 - 404.68] oxidize like metal
[400.36 - 406.52] oxidizes like a car gets Rusty well
[404.68 - 408.00] right now cars are made out of plastic I
[406.52 - 410.16] don't know what else they're made out of
[408.00 - 411.88] now I think they're made out of plastic
[410.16 - 415.32] and they're made out of what
[411.88 - 416.80] fiberglass um you know paper mâché I
[415.32 - 419.68] don't know what they're made out of Now
[416.80 - 422.12] cars but it used to be made out out of
[419.68 - 424.44] actual metal and you get a ding and then
[422.12 - 426.00] it would start rusting uh I don't know
[424.44 - 427.00] if you guys remember that does that date
[426.00 - 431.20] me or
[427.00 - 434.32] something bring me back too far but um
[431.20 - 436.76] so so that oxidizing so right when water
[434.32 - 439.00] would touch that open exposed metal or
[436.76 - 442.16] that carbon steel or whatever it is you
[439.00 - 446.28] know bam you know oxidizing would happen
[442.16 - 450.40] rust well we rust we actually rust we
[446.28 - 452.92] oxidize we fall apart we dissolve and
[450.40 - 455.20] that's what happens here when we're
[452.92 - 458.20] exposed to free radicals millions of
[455.20 - 460.08] free radicals pesticides pollutants
[458.20 - 462.08] chemicals there's crap falling out of
[460.08 - 463.84] the sky right now I mean and I'm not
[462.08 - 465.80] trying to put us into fear it's it's
[463.84 - 468.64] it's why I wrote the life-changing Foods
[465.80 - 470.44] book of that book The the subtitle to
[468.64 - 472.32] that book is save yourself and the ones
[470.44 - 474.32] you love with the hidden healing powers
[472.32 - 476.64] of fruits vegetables orb spices and wild
[474.32 - 480.40] Foods there's a reason for that because
[476.64 - 482.84] we can use our food to stop stop us from
[480.40 - 485.36] from oxidizing regardless of what kind
[482.84 - 486.88] of crap is floating out of the sky
[485.36 - 488.40] regardless of radiation that's still
[486.88 - 492.04] floating out of the sky from World War
[488.40 - 494.60] II you know from Hiroshima literally not
[492.04 - 496.08] even a fraction of radiation has fallen
[494.60 - 498.16] out of the sky from hoshima it's still
[496.08 - 500.20] floating up there we haven't even it the
[498.16 - 502.68] Fallout hasn't even happened never mind
[500.20 - 505.52] Fukushima hasn't even happened yet it's
[502.68 - 507.68] just starting to rain on it so so what
[505.52 - 509.72] can we do we can totally battle that we
[507.68 - 511.32] can totally adapt to that we can totally
[509.72 - 513.44] rise above that and that's what I
[511.32 - 515.36] explain in life-changing Foods never
[513.44 - 517.68] been done before the information I put
[515.36 - 520.08] in there from Spirit to actually protect
[517.68 - 523.36] us and our families and our children
[520.08 - 525.88] with Foods information about Foods never
[523.36 - 527.96] talked about ever before I made sure are
[525.88 - 529.84] in that book I didn't care what it took
[527.96 - 531.32] to write that book I didn't care what it
[529.84 - 533.48] took how many hours I had to stay up
[531.32 - 535.92] late how much sleep I lost I didn't care
[533.48 - 538.28] how crappy I felt I didn't care that
[535.92 - 541.68] book had to get done because I need
[538.28 - 543.60] everybody to have that and so when we
[541.68 - 545.20] talk about antioxidants that's a big
[543.60 - 547.56] part of what's in the book too when we
[545.20 - 549.48] talk about antibi
[547.56 - 552.68] antioxidants okay I was going to say
[549.48 - 555.64] something antibiotics actually really
[552.68 - 557.04] oxidize us they really oxidize us I was
[555.64 - 559.04] jumping ahead I was going to talk about
[557.04 - 561.56] that a little later so we take
[559.04 - 564.40] antibiotics for different things that
[561.56 - 567.04] quickens the oxidizing phase our organs
[564.40 - 569.64] start to oxidize our liver oxidizes so
[567.04 - 574.72] if we had antibiotics in us going all
[569.64 - 577.84] the way back we need a lot of
[574.72 - 580.56] antioxidants a lot of antioxidants more
[577.84 - 584.08] antibiotics you've used the more
[580.56 - 587.28] antioxidants you need on every way shape
[584.08 - 590.00] and form and and so that that's that's
[587.28 - 592.36] what matters and I talk about in
[590.00 - 595.04] previous shows about the 80,000 meals if
[592.36 - 598.48] you've had 40,000 crappy meals or 40,000
[595.04 - 599.96] not healthy meals or 40,000 uh you
[598.48 - 603.08] nonuse full
[599.96 - 605.20] meals um if you've had that you know
[603.08 - 607.40] then we need to make up we need make up
[605.20 - 609.36] time because or if you've had 20,000
[607.40 - 612.92] meals in your lifetime depending on how
[609.36 - 615.00] old you are now we need to make up all
[612.92 - 616.80] that and take this serious and get some
[615.00 - 618.08] good meals in us and we can do it we're
[616.80 - 621.28] going to talk about different foods
[618.08 - 624.28] today um as well so when it comes down
[621.28 - 626.76] to Eye Health eyes are affected by
[624.28 - 629.56] oxidizing by things oxidizing in our
[626.76 - 631.88] body heavy metals oxidizing in our body
[629.56 - 633.76] pesticides oxidizing our body stuff
[631.88 - 637.20] falling out of the sky you name it
[633.76 - 640.00] coming out of there and um and just just
[637.20 - 642.56] sprinkles on down literally just every
[640.00 - 644.88] day and that's okay we can adapt above
[642.56 - 649.48] it we can totally live in it without it
[644.88 - 652.16] affecting us if we protect ourselves Eye
[649.48 - 655.40] Health matters a lot because if we have
[652.16 - 657.20] any kind of eye issues um it's related
[655.40 - 659.28] to deficiencies it's related to
[657.20 - 660.84] antioxidants it's related to weight too
[659.28 - 662.36] many free radicals basically just
[660.84 - 666.08] poisons floating around in the body
[662.36 - 667.96] having their day and so we're going to
[666.08 - 671.76] cover different aspects of our health so
[667.96 - 673.84] that we can protect our eyes so it's a
[671.76 - 677.68] big deal when it comes down fruits
[673.84 - 681.24] vegetables herbs you know spices wild
[677.68 - 684.00] Foods this is what we need for our eyes
[681.24 - 687.48] that's what matters you know we always
[684.00 - 689.48] talk about the color of our eyes right
[687.48 - 691.44] isn't that what it's all about what's on
[689.48 - 693.24] your driver's license is say eye color
[691.44 - 696.92] on there you got brown color eyes you
[693.24 - 699.08] got blue you got green um so yeah it
[696.92 - 700.80] it's all about eye color and then you
[699.08 - 702.52] meet somebody and you're like oh my God
[700.80 - 704.36] look at your eyes look how look how
[702.52 - 707.28] amazing the color of your eyes are and
[704.36 - 711.12] it's all about eye color and when it
[707.28 - 714.00] comes down to um when it comes down to
[711.12 - 716.04] that very like term you know what's the
[714.00 - 718.56] color of your eyes we need to flip it to
[716.04 - 720.72] what's the color of your food what's the
[718.56 - 723.08] color of of your food that's what we
[720.72 - 724.88] need to do what's what kind of what food
[723.08 - 727.32] are you eating that has color in it of
[724.88 - 729.84] any kind and this is one of the most
[727.32 - 731.68] important aspects of Eye Health is
[729.84 - 734.20] what's what kind of colors are you
[731.68 - 735.80] actually eating and we know that we know
[734.20 - 737.76] colors that's already been going out
[735.80 - 742.04] that that round that information is is
[737.76 - 744.80] not specifically new um so but but
[742.04 - 747.48] colors matter so it's those pigments
[744.80 - 750.80] it's it's that it's that color in the
[747.48 - 752.44] food that lines up to the eyes in a lot
[750.80 - 756.32] of ways because what's in that color
[752.44 - 757.08] lots of antioxidants so the blue skin of
[756.32 - 759.36] a
[757.08 - 761.48] blueberry that blue skin in that
[759.36 - 764.88] blueberry that's packed with
[761.48 - 766.88] antioxidants and that is incredible for
[764.88 - 769.32] the eyes right there that's a big deal
[766.88 - 773.16] so that's the antioxidants we need now
[769.32 - 777.48] if it's a wild blueberry it's blue all
[773.16 - 781.80] the way through blue all the way through
[777.48 - 785.76] if it's a weak cultivated blueberry it's
[781.80 - 789.12] white and clear in the center with a
[785.76 - 791.04] blue skin so now that's fine if you it's
[789.12 - 792.88] all you got so if that's all you got is
[791.04 - 795.00] that clamshell that little pint-sized
[792.88 - 797.12] clamshell that you find at the uh the
[795.00 - 798.68] health food store or the protu section
[797.12 - 800.20] and it's the cultivated blueberry It's a
[798.68 - 801.80] larger blueberry and it's kind of white
[800.20 - 803.20] and clear inside and that's all you got
[801.80 - 805.36] it's still good for you it's still going
[803.20 - 806.84] to help it's still going to help in some
[805.36 - 809.36] ways with your eyes but you want to look
[806.84 - 810.72] for that wild blueberry
[809.36 - 812.48] you know people say to me you just love
[810.72 - 814.16] the wild blueberry I go how can I not
[812.48 - 815.84] love the most powerful food on the
[814.16 - 817.40] planet that literally can stop any
[815.84 - 820.48] disease and symptom that's going on in
[817.40 - 823.60] our lives how can I am I supposed to
[820.48 - 826.36] stop talking about the wild
[823.60 - 828.12] blueberry am am I I'm supposed to be
[826.36 - 830.60] done okay I talked about it one time
[828.12 - 834.20] that's it no it's that
[830.60 - 836.64] important and it's blue all the way
[834.20 - 839.72] through all the way through purple and
[836.64 - 842.32] blue all the way through and so that's
[839.72 - 844.04] what I'm talking about when it comes
[842.32 - 847.48] down to Eye Health right there that
[844.04 - 849.72] example Alone um in life-changing Foods
[847.48 - 851.84] I really Lay It lay it out about what
[849.72 - 853.56] the wild blueberry does for our bodies
[851.84 - 857.28] and what it does for our soul and
[853.56 - 859.32] everything and the power of it and um
[857.28 - 861.56] because it's it's a lot to talk about in
[859.32 - 863.96] in just one show it literally could take
[861.56 - 865.72] over one show the wild blueberry so it
[863.96 - 867.32] comes down to Colors just like we're
[865.72 - 869.84] always focused on the color of our eyes
[867.32 - 871.56] hey you got green eyes wao they're so
[869.84 - 874.72] pretty or you got you know blue eyes
[871.56 - 878.12] look at that or whatever it is it's it
[874.72 - 880.88] should be like hey wow that food has
[878.12 - 884.32] that color who look at the color of that
[880.88 - 886.92] food and and that matters because that's
[884.32 - 888.76] antioxidants and it matters now okay
[886.92 - 891.12] fine now there's there's something else
[888.76 - 893.24] you have to understand the inside of
[891.12 - 896.48] food that doesn't have a lot of color we
[893.24 - 899.36] don't want to negate that on any level
[896.48 - 901.04] so the inside of a radish is white
[899.36 - 904.04] but that doesn't mean something else
[901.04 - 905.92] special isn't in there okay so that
[904.04 - 907.20] doesn't mean that something else isn't
[905.92 - 909.44] really special in there so always
[907.20 - 911.64] remember that so foods that have white
[909.44 - 914.32] to them or clear to them still have
[911.64 - 916.00] something in them they have minerals
[914.32 - 919.24] they have minerals that's the other
[916.00 - 921.60] aspect of your eyes color Okay color
[919.24 - 923.08] matters with the food that's one thing
[921.60 - 927.28] that we got to connect to the eyes
[923.08 - 930.04] that's critical and the other one is you
[927.28 - 932.20] know is that the mineral composition so
[930.04 - 934.52] it's antioxidants with color and then
[932.20 - 935.96] it's the mineral composition these are
[934.52 - 939.24] the two things that we have to use for
[935.96 - 941.12] our eyes and this is critical we're
[939.24 - 942.56] going to talk about different facets of
[941.12 - 943.76] what's going on people's eyes we're
[942.56 - 947.88] going to get into that we're going to
[943.76 - 949.40] get into the nitty-gritty there um so
[947.88 - 951.60] because what happens is when you get
[949.40 - 953.84] inside of food when you get inside of
[951.60 - 955.56] food you got chromium in there you got
[953.84 - 958.16] selenium in there you got manganese in
[955.56 - 960.52] there you got M mbum you got in there
[958.16 - 962.60] you got uh you got you know a little bit
[960.52 - 964.64] of zinc zinc is a hard one it's hard to
[962.60 - 966.88] get zinc and food no matter where we
[964.64 - 970.60] really search but there's still traces
[966.88 - 972.48] left in some foods so either way it's
[970.60 - 974.96] the mineral composition too in these
[972.48 - 977.52] foods that are so important so
[974.96 - 981.84] understand that remember that
[977.52 - 984.16] um so let's talk about like some eye
[981.84 - 986.64] symptoms and eye conditions you guys
[984.16 - 988.24] ready for that I figure someone out
[986.64 - 990.36] there has an eye problem in some way
[988.24 - 992.92] some shape or some
[990.36 - 996.20] form let's talk about
[992.92 - 998.20] blurriness blurriness of the eyes now
[996.20 - 1000.64] here's here's the deal with blurriness
[998.20 - 1003.04] it's complicated it's complicated
[1000.64 - 1005.72] because everybody's blurriness is
[1003.04 - 1007.80] different it's different someone else's
[1005.72 - 1010.00] blurry eyes isn't someone else's blurry
[1007.80 - 1012.32] eyes that it's entirely a different
[1010.00 - 1013.60] thing going on there's other there a
[1012.32 - 1017.64] whole bunch of reasons why we have
[1013.60 - 1019.48] blurry eyes and let's explore some of it
[1017.64 - 1022.48] uh eyes are so complicated we're just
[1019.48 - 1025.08] going to get what we can get done so for
[1022.48 - 1028.20] example one person could have blurry
[1025.08 - 1030.04] eyes caused by macular
[1028.20 - 1032.12] degeneration okay so macular
[1030.04 - 1034.92] degeneration you guys know that one did
[1032.12 - 1036.92] you go to the eye doctor and like hey I
[1034.92 - 1039.84] the eye doctors like I see some
[1036.92 - 1042.24] degeneration in here we get we got some
[1039.84 - 1043.76] problems um so maybe you're one that's
[1042.24 - 1047.40] been going through that or you you've
[1043.76 - 1050.64] been through that see now macular
[1047.40 - 1053.64] degeneration is first of all is an
[1050.64 - 1055.56] antioxidant deficiency and a mineral
[1053.64 - 1058.08] deficiency it's an antioxidant
[1055.56 - 1059.28] deficiency and a mineral deficiency you
[1058.08 - 1061.20] have to know that about Immaculate
[1059.28 - 1063.80] degeneration it's it's it's not
[1061.20 - 1065.92] technically like uh it's not like other
[1063.80 - 1068.88] things that go wrong with eyes it's
[1065.92 - 1072.00] really just for the first 10 years of
[1068.88 - 1073.96] your life you had just food that had
[1072.00 - 1075.44] really nothing in it first 20 years of
[1073.96 - 1077.72] your life you might have food that's had
[1075.44 - 1080.24] nothing in it first 30 years of your
[1077.72 - 1083.44] life um I always kid around and say you
[1080.24 - 1085.88] know people eat fruit when it's on their
[1083.44 - 1087.08] Strawberry Shortcake so they have
[1085.88 - 1090.08] strawberries when it's on Strawberry
[1087.08 - 1093.12] Shortcake they eat blueberries when it's
[1090.08 - 1096.64] in a pancake they eat blueberries when
[1093.12 - 1098.56] it's in a muffin you know I remember um
[1096.64 - 1099.88] years ago a friend of mine was like look
[1098.56 - 1101.84] I eat a lot of blueberries I was like
[1099.88 - 1103.20] well where are you getting them and my
[1101.84 - 1105.44] friend says well I have a blueberry
[1103.20 - 1108.08] muffin every morning I I I couldn't
[1105.44 - 1109.88] believe it yeah first of all I laughed
[1108.08 - 1111.72] you know I had a good laugh which is
[1109.88 - 1113.24] probably maybe that's not the the best
[1111.72 - 1116.20] thing that that I could have done for
[1113.24 - 1118.56] support but it was the first thing I did
[1116.20 - 1121.48] anyway I couldn't help it I I do tend to
[1118.56 - 1124.80] laugh a lot but the point is is that you
[1121.48 - 1126.28] know he really thought that all the all
[1124.80 - 1127.72] the blueberries and a blueberry muffin
[1126.28 - 1129.00] were going to cut it and I said well
[1127.72 - 1130.68] where's your blueberry muffin where did
[1129.00 - 1133.04] you get it and what you know what are
[1130.68 - 1135.44] they using and then they're using fake
[1133.04 - 1138.44] blueberries on top of
[1135.44 - 1140.36] it so sorry about that you guys so
[1138.44 - 1141.92] they're using fake blueberries on top of
[1140.36 - 1143.24] it was it even real blueberries in the
[1141.92 - 1144.68] blueberry muffin they're fake
[1143.24 - 1145.84] blueberries there's actually fake
[1144.68 - 1147.64] blueberries they're actually fake
[1145.84 - 1150.84] they're made out of some kind of like uh
[1147.64 - 1153.68] jelly and some kind of um um some kind
[1150.84 - 1156.32] of gelatinous stuff that's dyed blue and
[1153.68 - 1159.04] flavored blue so anyway so he was
[1156.32 - 1160.56] getting lots of blueberries and um you
[1159.04 - 1161.76] know and then some people you know they
[1160.56 - 1164.28] have you know they get their apple and
[1161.76 - 1166.48] apple pie some people get their bananas
[1164.28 - 1168.44] and banana you know Sundays or whatever

[1172.36 - 1177.92] them and and then you know every now and
[1175.00 - 1181.48] then someone has you know like a slice
[1177.92 - 1185.76] of Mandarin or something like that in

[1245.40 - 1250.32] good that I'm like whoa and a mind blown
[1248.08 - 1251.68] from it because they're doing nothing
[1250.32 - 1253.16] but their smoothies and they're doing
[1251.68 - 1254.72] lots and lots of wild blueberries and
[1253.16 - 1256.88] I'm like wo I didn't even have my wild
[1254.72 - 1257.92] blueberries today and so I'm really
[1256.88 - 1259.00] proud of every but I'm proud of
[1257.92 - 1260.36] everything everybody I'm proud of
[1259.00 - 1261.76] everybody because you know we all got
[1260.36 - 1263.36] different circumstances and we got to
[1261.76 - 1265.80] just do the best we can and eat when we
[1263.36 - 1268.96] can and eat what we can get what we can
[1265.80 - 1271.00] I I I understand the whole situation um
[1268.96 - 1274.08] so blurriness of the eyes so say we got
[1271.00 - 1276.80] Mac degeneration that's like a
[1274.08 - 1280.52] historic piece of your life that's
[1276.80 - 1283.44] that's missing something or or basically
[1280.52 - 1285.80] it's history in your life with all these
[1283.44 - 1287.72] missing pieces and these Miss missing
[1285.80 - 1289.32] pieces are antioxidants at all these
[1287.72 - 1292.36] different times in your lives and
[1289.32 - 1293.64] minerals minerals from foods that you
[1292.36 - 1297.16] know they're mineral
[1293.64 - 1299.32] rich and that comes from fruits
[1297.16 - 1302.24] vegetables herb
[1299.32 - 1306.80] spices uh and wild Foods that's where it
[1302.24 - 1309.16] comes from it comes from there so we're
[1306.80 - 1311.24] going to you know and and that's the
[1309.16 - 1313.84] whole thing that's that's where it comes
[1311.24 - 1315.60] from and um and like I talk about
[1313.84 - 1318.36] life-changing Foods I talk about every
[1315.60 - 1322.48] disease and illness literally a fruit or
[1318.36 - 1325.48] a vegetable herb spice can help
[1322.48 - 1327.52] reverse um all right so immaculate
[1325.48 - 1328.52] degeneration it's about antioxidants
[1327.52 - 1329.96] what do we need to do we're going to
[1328.52 - 1331.28] talk about foods to help that a little
[1329.96 - 1333.04] later on we're going to talk about
[1331.28 - 1335.08] supplements to help that a little later
[1333.04 - 1337.28] on but that's one form of blurriness you
[1335.08 - 1340.96] guys that's one form of
[1337.28 - 1345.08] blurriness and then what about another
[1340.96 - 1347.60] form of blurry vision that's different
[1345.08 - 1349.84] that that isn't the same thing and you
[1347.60 - 1351.96] know the doctor's look you go to the
[1349.84 - 1353.60] doctor the eye doctor you say hey look
[1351.96 - 1355.16] you know I got these blurry eyes I don't
[1353.60 - 1356.96] know what's going on here is it my
[1355.16 - 1359.44] prescription do I need
[1356.96 - 1360.88] glasses and the eye doctor looks and the
[1359.44 - 1362.56] eye doctor says say you have
[1360.88 - 1364.36] prescriptions anyway the eye doctor says
[1362.56 - 1367.12] well your prescriptions are fine they ly
[1364.36 - 1368.96] up um you have no macular degeneration
[1367.12 - 1370.84] you got no glaucoma you got nothing else
[1368.96 - 1374.28] going on I don't know why you have
[1370.84 - 1377.04] blurry eyes the mystery blurry eyes okay
[1374.28 - 1379.04] that's neurological that's neurological
[1377.04 - 1380.56] that's central nervous system so mystery
[1379.04 - 1381.88] blur eyes is a central nervous system
[1380.56 - 1383.36] and if anybody dealing with it's going
[1381.88 - 1385.28] to they're going to know that it gets a
[1383.36 - 1386.88] little better in the morning okay so
[1385.28 - 1388.64] when they wake up the morning they might
[1386.88 - 1390.32] be a little blurry at first for a few
[1388.64 - 1391.60] minutes but when they Shake It Off and
[1390.32 - 1392.84] and get out of their tiredness and
[1391.60 - 1394.12] everything else their eyes are more
[1392.84 - 1395.64] clear and then towards the end of the
[1394.12 - 1396.92] day they just get more blurry by night
[1395.64 - 1400.28] time they get blurry blurry and they're
[1396.92 - 1402.28] just totally blurry and that's ner
[1400.28 - 1403.56] that's the central nervous system that's
[1402.28 - 1405.28] the kind of blurriness that gets in the
[1403.56 - 1408.12] way of people driving you have a
[1405.28 - 1411.40] sensitive central nervous system that's
[1408.12 - 1413.68] that blurriness is usually from um other
[1411.40 - 1417.32] things happening like a blood toxicity a
[1413.68 - 1420.08] liver condition um heavy metals in the
[1417.32 - 1422.00] liver uh viral issues like an Epstein
[1420.08 - 1423.84] bar in the liver so maybe you guys have
[1422.00 - 1425.48] noticed that with some of your Epstein
[1423.84 - 1427.28] bar issues that you're learning now here
[1425.48 - 1428.88] at the show and you're learning with
[1427.28 - 1429.84] with the different you know Facebook
[1428.88 - 1432.08] groups and everything that we're
[1429.84 - 1434.60] teaching the information about epsteen
[1432.08 - 1436.92] bar that your blurry eyes really really
[1434.60 - 1439.36] can be that low-grade uh viral thing
[1436.92 - 1441.52] because the FD bar releases poisons and
[1439.36 - 1443.36] toxins and the liver gets filled with
[1441.52 - 1444.92] toxins the blood gets toxic and you get
[1443.36 - 1446.88] the blurry eyes it affects the central
[1444.92 - 1448.84] nervous system it then that's what
[1446.88 - 1450.64] happens it's one form of blurry eyes
[1448.84 - 1454.16] right there and
[1450.64 - 1455.80] then there's another type of blurry eyes
[1454.16 - 1457.44] cuz blurry eyes are the most popular
[1455.80 - 1459.00] issue actually one of the most popular
[1457.44 - 1462.12] issues so I'm really hitting that hard
[1459.00 - 1465.68] now there's another type of blurry eyes
[1462.12 - 1468.12] and this blury eye is about blood sugar
[1465.68 - 1470.16] it's about blood sugar so blood sugar
[1468.12 - 1474.04] issues hypoglycemia
[1470.16 - 1476.84] hypoglycemia mostly hypo um and uh
[1474.04 - 1478.20] inconsistent blood blood sugar issues uh
[1476.84 - 1481.08] glucose
[1478.20 - 1483.20] deficiencies um you know that all that
[1481.08 - 1487.24] sporadic blood sugar you know high high
[1483.20 - 1489.20] A1C whatever and that you know those
[1487.24 - 1490.80] blood sugar disorders whatever someone
[1489.20 - 1493.44] has even on a mild level will give you
[1490.80 - 1496.44] blurry eyes that could easily give you
[1493.44 - 1499.40] blurry eyes and a lot of the different
[1496.44 - 1505.60] type 2 diabetes pre- diabetes high
[1499.40 - 1508.24] A1C um um uh hypoglycemia all that is is
[1505.60 - 1509.76] is adrenals and liver adrenals and liver
[1508.24 - 1511.56] adrenals and liver so once again we're
[1509.76 - 1514.24] back to the liver we're back to
[1511.56 - 1516.20] adrenals and um that's a big part of
[1514.24 - 1519.84] that all on its own so that's another
[1516.20 - 1521.48] form of blurry vision so that means that
[1519.84 - 1523.40] look protect your adrenals if you're in
[1521.48 - 1524.84] that form of blurry vision it's time to
[1523.40 - 1526.00] protect your adrenals it's time to eat
[1524.84 - 1528.60] every hour and a half can't let your
[1526.00 - 1530.84] blood sugar drop uh lower the animal
[1528.60 - 1532.92] protein um you know the more animal
[1530.84 - 1534.68] protein you eat with hypoglycemia you'll
[1532.92 - 1536.40] feel like it balances out but the worse
[1534.68 - 1537.68] it'll get and turn into pre-diabetes so
[1536.40 - 1539.56] it means you have to lower the animal
[1537.68 - 1540.64] protein I'm not against animal protein
[1539.56 - 1542.44] I'm just saying if you're dealing with
[1540.64 - 1543.88] hypoglycemia you're dealing with blurry
[1542.44 - 1545.80] eyes because of blood sugar issu you got
[1543.88 - 1547.72] to lower the animal protein could maybe
[1545.80 - 1549.52] eat it once a day and the rest has to be
[1547.72 - 1551.52] more fruits and vegetables and salads
[1549.52 - 1554.12] and and um different things like that
[1551.52 - 1556.00] that we always talk about and you'll see
[1554.12 - 1557.36] you can get a little bit better but you
[1556.00 - 1558.44] have to eat every hour hour and a half
[1557.36 - 1561.24] if you're dealing with that kind of
[1558.44 - 1562.48] blurry eye and that's a big deal so you
[1561.24 - 1564.00] want to support your adrenals and
[1562.48 - 1566.56] strengthen your adrenals clean up your
[1564.00 - 1567.88] liver and um and then maybe down the
[1566.56 - 1569.24] road you can bring in more animal
[1567.88 - 1570.68] protein if you want you know once you
[1569.24 - 1572.32] get it under control and get it in a
[1570.68 - 1574.16] better place and and don't set yourself
[1572.32 - 1577.32] in the in in the stage for pre-diabetes
[1574.16 - 1578.84] and diabetes um and so that's that and
[1577.32 - 1580.72] as long you just have to have a healthy
[1578.84 - 1583.84] diet too around it all but that's one
[1580.72 - 1588.44] type of blurry eyes that we're talking
[1583.84 - 1590.36] about and so um and then there's other
[1588.44 - 1591.96] things too let's let's leave blurry eyes
[1590.36 - 1595.00] for a little bit let's go into other
[1591.96 - 1596.60] areas too people talk about glasses they
[1595.00 - 1598.16] say well if you need glasses you got
[1596.60 - 1601.60] some you know you got a health problem
[1598.16 - 1604.92] or you got eye problems not necessarily
[1601.60 - 1607.68] with glasses that's not how it works um
[1604.92 - 1610.28] if a child needs glasses early this is
[1607.68 - 1613.56] this is mercury inherited from the
[1610.28 - 1617.96] family this is mercury passed down from
[1613.56 - 1619.36] the family line Mercury causes people to
[1617.96 - 1622.64] need
[1619.36 - 1626.20] glasses not entirely every reason why
[1622.64 - 1629.00] people need to to have glasses but it is
[1626.20 - 1634.28] responsible for people needing glasses
[1629.00 - 1637.60] Mercury is is um disorient disorientates
[1634.28 - 1640.52] the eye it basically it basically throws
[1637.60 - 1643.28] off the eyes the eye muscles it throws
[1640.52 - 1644.88] off the eyes responses it throws off the
[1643.28 - 1647.72] um even some of the nerves behind the
[1644.88 - 1649.36] eye Mercury does a whole bunch of things
[1647.72 - 1651.16] and if it's systemic if Mercury is
[1649.36 - 1653.60] systemic and it comes from a family line
[1651.16 - 1656.64] or you picked up new Mercury you know
[1653.60 - 1658.72] you know children will have will need
[1656.64 - 1661.52] glasses and they will need them soon
[1658.72 - 1663.20] literally it can happen overnight and
[1661.52 - 1665.92] that's what happens with Mercury and the
[1663.20 - 1668.20] Mercury's effect on as far as everything
[1665.92 - 1670.80] to do with Eye Health so it's a big part
[1668.20 - 1672.44] of it right there so um some people
[1670.80 - 1673.92] collect little bit a little bit of
[1672.44 - 1676.04] mounts of mercury throughout their whole
[1673.92 - 1678.08] life they have a little bit of inherited
[1676.04 - 1680.12] and then they um collect it over you
[1678.08 - 1682.28] know all through their life and all
[1680.12 - 1684.28] through their life and then their eyes
[1682.28 - 1688.32] start going at they start kneading
[1684.28 - 1690.68] glasses at age 40 age 42 age 44 this is
[1688.32 - 1692.92] just your normal average buildup of
[1690.68 - 1695.44] heavy metal toxicity forcing you know
[1692.92 - 1698.24] glasses to be needed um this is a big
[1695.44 - 1701.04] part of it and so when it comes down to
[1698.24 - 1705.16] glasses it's really just you know higher
[1701.04 - 1707.00] levels of mercury in the body um and but
[1705.16 - 1708.12] we're not allowed to talk about Mercury
[1707.00 - 1709.76] ever
[1708.12 - 1711.92] instead we have to completely avoid it
[1709.76 - 1714.24] like it doesn't exist um in
[1711.92 - 1717.48] life-changing Foods I really Let it
[1714.24 - 1719.40] Loose about the things that are taking
[1717.48 - 1721.36] us down as a culture as a society and
[1719.40 - 1724.88] really harming us and one of those is
[1721.36 - 1726.84] Mercury and um but hey everybody wants
[1724.88 - 1728.72] to blame it on our jeans because no one
[1726.84 - 1730.72] wants to go there no one wants to go
[1728.72 - 1733.12] there no one wants to know what's really
[1730.72 - 1734.56] causing our problems and how you know we
[1733.12 - 1736.24] have this Mercury that's being passed
[1734.56 - 1738.00] from generation to generation it's
[1736.24 - 1740.12] ruining our eyes it's causing all kinds
[1738.00 - 1741.64] of trouble but hey no blame it on our
[1740.12 - 1743.60] jeans it's always the easy way out it's
[1741.64 - 1745.64] the best way out because it's your fault
[1743.60 - 1747.12] that means it's your fault I love that I
[1745.64 - 1749.20] love how it's always blamed on us
[1747.12 - 1751.76] autoimmune it's your fault genetics it's
[1749.20 - 1753.76] your fault um you know you're just a
[1751.76 - 1756.04] pain in the ass it's your fault how
[1753.76 - 1758.44] about that so that's just not how it
[1756.04 - 1760.24] works it's how it should work and and we
[1758.44 - 1761.88] need to change that tide and it's
[1760.24 - 1763.88] important and that's what that's that's
[1761.88 - 1765.36] the whole point so we have to be honest
[1763.88 - 1768.08] about the Mercury that we have that
[1765.36 - 1770.08] we're inherited and we get uh you know
[1768.08 - 1771.96] affected by now and collect throughout a
[1770.08 - 1773.32] lifetime and it has to come out that's
[1771.96 - 1775.44] why the heavy metal detoxes are
[1773.32 - 1776.88] important so what I'm saying is if
[1775.44 - 1779.48] you're somebody dealing with eyeglasses
[1776.88 - 1781.52] needing eyeg glasses it's heavy metal
[1779.48 - 1783.68] detox is what you have to do is what you
[1781.52 - 1785.96] need to do someone said to me recently
[1783.68 - 1788.88] you know you you wear glasses Anthony
[1785.96 - 1791.80] and I said do you know my
[1788.88 - 1793.84] story do you know my story because if
[1791.80 - 1796.24] you don't know my story let me give you
[1793.84 - 1798.20] a little uh a little basis a little
[1796.24 - 1802.20] Foundation of my story
[1798.20 - 1804.64] you know I live my life 34 blind because
[1802.20 - 1807.60] I see nothing but white from spirit's
[1804.64 - 1811.20] light because I do readings non-stop my
[1807.60 - 1812.80] entire life so everybody you know people
[1811.20 - 1815.36] if you're not blind for other reasons or
[1812.80 - 1817.44] handicapped or blind for other reasons
[1815.36 - 1819.60] um and um and you're not blind and you
[1817.44 - 1822.28] have you have you know your regular
[1819.60 - 1824.20] eyesight you get to see you know your
[1822.28 - 1826.64] whole life your whole there's no three
[1824.20 - 1829.72] quarters missing I have three quarters
[1826.64 - 1831.72] missing my life because it goes white
[1829.72 - 1833.56] and I talk about that and I I've talked
[1831.72 - 1835.48] about this before in different places
[1833.56 - 1837.04] it's a it's a light blindness that comes
[1835.48 - 1838.44] when Spirit does readings or I look
[1837.04 - 1842.72] inside the body of
[1838.44 - 1844.48] somebody and the um and and the light
[1842.72 - 1846.04] that happens you know that's why I have
[1844.48 - 1848.48] to need an assistant when I go on an
[1846.04 - 1849.92] airplane because I just lose my eyesight
[1848.48 - 1851.88] in the airport instantly because I'm
[1849.92 - 1853.88] doing all the readings Spirit sending
[1851.88 - 1856.24] light down I'm looking at everybody I'm
[1853.88 - 1858.08] doing reads it's it's Unstoppable I
[1856.24 - 1862.28] can't stop it's been happening since Age
[1858.08 - 1865.08] 4 and so what I did was um and I went to
[1862.28 - 1865.88] the eye doctor uh and in myself and I
[1865.08 - 1866.92] said you know what I'm going go to an
[1865.88 - 1869.48] eye doctor I'm going to have my I'm
[1866.92 - 1872.04] going to talk about my gift and how it
[1869.48 - 1875.12] blinds out my light and take wipes it
[1872.04 - 1876.20] all out and you know and I can't see so
[1875.12 - 1877.56] the eye doctor looked at my eyes and
[1876.20 - 1878.84] said well you got the perfect 2020
[1877.56 - 1880.92] Vision so you don't have an eye problem
[1878.84 - 1882.52] so you don't need glasses and I told him
[1880.92 - 1884.08] about what was going on he said you know
[1882.52 - 1886.00] what though we could probably throw on
[1884.08 - 1887.72] some glasses so that when you go in
[1886.00 - 1890.28] front of crowds and you do things that
[1887.72 - 1891.96] you can see farther away with all the
[1890.28 - 1894.96] haze of light that you got to live with
[1891.96 - 1896.88] maybe it'll improve You by by um 1% or
[1894.96 - 1899.04] something and it has it actually it
[1896.88 - 1901.24] actually helps so when I'm doing events
[1899.04 - 1903.40] or anything else it helps get through
[1901.24 - 1905.32] the smoke and fog of that bright light
[1903.40 - 1908.44] that Spirit sends down so that's why I
[1905.32 - 1910.32] wear glasses but um but you know when I
[1908.44 - 1912.44] do wear them and then but the point is
[1910.32 - 1915.52] is that when we have to wear glasses
[1912.44 - 1916.88] though in life and everything we we have
[1915.52 - 1918.40] we're dealing with a Mercury issue we're
[1916.88 - 1920.88] dealing with the heavy metal that we
[1918.40 - 1922.80] have to deal with and that has to be
[1920.88 - 1924.28] that has to be cleaned up and your eyes
[1922.80 - 1926.76] will get better your eyes will get
[1924.28 - 1928.12] better I lots of people I know that have
[1926.76 - 1932.52] done the heavy metal
[1928.12 - 1934.44] detox have um have they've gotten rid of
[1932.52 - 1937.44] their glasses and they've been able to
[1934.44 - 1940.32] toss them and throw them out um you know
[1937.44 - 1942.56] don't do that yet make sure that you're
[1940.32 - 1944.72] taking care making sure that you're
[1942.56 - 1946.52] taking care of yourself um you know
[1944.72 - 1948.20] meaning use your glasses for a while
[1946.52 - 1949.56] until you start adjusting and then you
[1948.20 - 1951.64] start adjusting and then you start
[1949.56 - 1953.84] adjusting get the heavy metals out build
[1951.64 - 1956.12] yourself up get the antioxidants in get
[1953.84 - 1957.48] the minerals in with all the foods that
[1956.12 - 1959.16] we're going to talk about a little later
[1957.48 - 1960.92] and you can be one of those people that
[1959.16 - 1963.68] actually doesn't need their glasses as
[1960.92 - 1965.28] much anymore or in different or they you
[1963.68 - 1966.68] your in eyesight improves enough where
[1965.28 - 1969.72] you only need them partially or whatever
[1966.68 - 1973.04] it is so um but as far as children
[1969.72 - 1975.72] needing glasses at age six or age4 age8
[1973.04 - 1977.80] that's from large deposits of mercury
[1975.72 - 1980.16] that are that are that are p on Down the
[1977.80 - 1984.40] Line plus new collections of it so let's
[1980.16 - 1986.68] keep that in mind and um so let's talk
[1984.40 - 1989.96] about some different things as well
[1986.68 - 1991.92] glaucoma glaucoma that's an interesting
[1989.96 - 1993.56] one eye pressure inflammation blood
[1991.92 - 1995.28] vessels eye pressure the whole bit
[1993.56 - 1996.92] that's from Epstein bar that's the
[1995.28 - 1998.76] culprit for glaucoma there's an Epstein
[1996.92 - 2001.84] bar virus of variety that causes
[1998.76 - 2003.96] glaucoma and I've seen this variety not
[2001.84 - 2005.92] do much of anything besides give
[2003.96 - 2007.64] somebody a little fatigue until they
[2005.92 - 2009.56] become 80 years old and they get the
[2007.64 - 2012.68] glaucoma or they get a little fatigue at
[2009.56 - 2014.48] age 60 70 doesn't really do much but the
[2012.68 - 2016.24] variety of Epstein bar I'm talking about
[2014.48 - 2018.28] ends up causing glaucoma so that's
[2016.24 - 2021.24] that's actually one of the variety of of
[2018.28 - 2022.52] varieties of Epstein bar and so you when
[2021.24 - 2025.20] if you're dealing with glaucoma you got
[2022.52 - 2027.68] to deal with antivirals antivirals
[2025.20 - 2030.76] antivirals antivirals which leads me to
[2027.68 - 2033.56] something to tell you that most I
[2030.76 - 2034.92] conditions are viral and that's that's a
[2033.56 - 2037.00] whole different that's a whole another
[2034.92 - 2039.12] thing so let's talk about some different
[2037.00 - 2040.56] eye conditions here we got glaucoma
[2039.12 - 2042.76] which is viral that's Epstein bar
[2040.56 - 2044.68] related so you want to do an anti-
[2042.76 - 2046.24] Epstein bar protocols including diets
[2044.68 - 2048.24] and all the different things to knock
[2046.24 - 2049.72] that out and and and improve that so
[2048.24 - 2051.68] your eye pressure comes down and I've
[2049.72 - 2052.80] seen people's eye pressures drop from
[2051.68 - 2054.68] getting the right things in them
[2052.80 - 2056.88] including getting zinc in them and
[2054.68 - 2059.60] getting the right Foods you know getting
[2056.88 - 2061.64] rid of the eggs the dairy products um
[2059.60 - 2063.76] doing some antivirals olive leaf you
[2061.64 - 2066.60] know I've seen people's people get
[2063.76 - 2068.80] better with that now lots of vitamin C
[2066.60 - 2071.24] also helps get rid of glaucoma too over
[2068.80 - 2074.12] time and drops the pressure down
[2071.24 - 2077.48] now there's other things associated with
[2074.12 - 2079.24] viral issues like burning eye burning
[2077.48 - 2082.08] you know I've had people come to me o
[2079.24 - 2084.92] over the years the worst eye burning and
[2082.08 - 2086.88] it's hell and it and it completely
[2084.92 - 2088.36] disables them and they can't function
[2086.88 - 2089.92] they can't work they can't do anything
[2088.36 - 2091.32] they got burning around their eyes they
[2089.92 - 2093.40] got burning under their eyes they got
[2091.32 - 2095.08] burning above their eyes they're running
[2093.40 - 2097.00] around they think it's mold and it's not
[2095.08 - 2098.48] mold and they go to you know 100
[2097.00 - 2101.00] different doctors the neurologist you
[2098.48 - 2103.60] name it and they get MRIs CAT scans at
[2101.00 - 2106.40] the brain and the eye burning is
[2103.60 - 2108.28] Relentless and that's really you know
[2106.40 - 2111.20] that that kills me when I see somebody
[2108.28 - 2114.44] going through that because um because
[2111.20 - 2115.72] it's just it's it's horrible and so what
[2114.44 - 2117.92] happens with that that's usually the
[2115.72 - 2120.40] shingles that does the eye burning um
[2117.92 - 2121.68] I've seen Epstein bar Edge onto it
[2120.40 - 2123.16] sometimes or hedg it but the shingles
[2121.68 - 2124.84] tend to do a lot of eye burning you
[2123.16 - 2126.32] don't need a rash to have the eye
[2124.84 - 2128.20] burning although some people they break
[2126.32 - 2130.92] out shingles on the shoulder they break
[2128.20 - 2134.88] out shingles on the shoulder um the
[2130.92 - 2137.32] shoulder blade back uh you know uh neck
[2134.88 - 2139.20] torso what they break out with a
[2137.32 - 2140.64] shingles and then it goes away 5 years
[2139.20 - 2142.32] later they have burning eyes that's
[2140.64 - 2144.88] that's later stage shingles without the
[2142.32 - 2146.40] rash so um and you don't even have to
[2144.88 - 2148.32] have the rash in order to have that so
[2146.40 - 2151.00] the burning eyes is is a lot of shingle
[2148.32 - 2153.64] stuff so what you do is um you know we
[2151.00 - 2156.32] work on the shingles protocols uh very
[2153.64 - 2157.40] important uh so that's that's critical
[2156.32 - 2160.00] but it's good good to know what's
[2157.40 - 2162.44] causing it tickling tingling Sensations
[2160.00 - 2165.00] on the side of the face causing eye
[2162.44 - 2167.00] issues you know temple on the temple
[2165.00 - 2169.48] causing eyes to squint causing eyes to
[2167.00 - 2171.88] feel weak causing eyes to burn a little
[2169.48 - 2176.00] bit that's all shingles it's all viral
[2171.88 - 2177.64] too floaters floaters white spots black
[2176.00 - 2178.84] spots unexplained you're at the eye
[2177.64 - 2180.84] doctor don't know what the hell it is
[2178.84 - 2182.92] that's that's Epstein bar that's Epstein
[2180.84 - 2185.36] BR that's 100% viral it's a lot of
[2182.92 - 2187.16] neurotoxin floating around in the body
[2185.36 - 2188.84] um and short circuits the it actually
[2187.16 - 2190.64] short circuits currents and electrical
[2188.84 - 2192.20] currents that go to the eye and causes
[2190.64 - 2193.48] floaters it causes all kinds of
[2192.20 - 2195.12] different things now I'm not talking
[2193.48 - 2196.36] about detach retina and you see
[2195.12 - 2197.84] something because you got to detach
[2196.36 - 2199.68] retina and you're seeing you know a dark
[2197.84 - 2201.08] spot or you're seeing something else I'm
[2199.68 - 2204.48] talking about floaters that are
[2201.08 - 2206.28] unexplained that's all Epstein bar 100%
[2204.48 - 2208.04] um and it gets us every time the
[2206.28 - 2209.16] floaters are really annoying that's
[2208.04 - 2210.44] that's that's something that's really
[2209.16 - 2212.16] annoying that's why I'm doing the life
[2210.44 - 2214.04] changing Foods book I put it out there
[2212.16 - 2215.88] because I have that symptom showing what
[2214.04 - 2218.00] foods to deal with that symptom you
[2215.88 - 2219.76] focus on that symptom take the foods out
[2218.00 - 2221.36] of the book focus on just those foods
[2219.76 - 2223.84] and you get better you start moving
[2221.36 - 2226.20] forward and you start going past things
[2223.84 - 2228.24] um so floaters is a big one there uh
[2226.20 - 2229.96] trigeminal neuralgia trigeminal
[2228.24 - 2231.48] neuralgia is caused by shingles that's
[2229.96 - 2233.44] something that goes up the neck it goes
[2231.48 - 2235.48] in the jaw it goes in you know you get
[2233.44 - 2237.32] told you have TMJ sometimes you don't
[2235.48 - 2239.80] get told you have TMJ but you just have
[2237.32 - 2243.12] that pain that tends to run to the eye
[2239.80 - 2245.48] causing eye pain so eye pain unexplained
[2243.12 - 2247.76] eye pain is the nerves caused by
[2245.48 - 2249.76] trigeminal neuralgia caused by shingles
[2247.76 - 2251.60] that's a whole another one too so let me
[2249.76 - 2253.40] just simplify you got eye pain it's
[2251.60 - 2255.96] unexplainable it's the shingles
[2253.40 - 2258.08] simplified okay if we want to complicate
[2255.96 - 2259.68] it yes it's trigeminal neuralgia it's
[2258.08 - 2262.24] from the neurotoxin from shingles
[2259.68 - 2264.20] inflaming the nerve the trigeminal nerve
[2262.24 - 2266.04] when that nerve gets inflamed it'll give
[2264.20 - 2269.52] you eye pain that's a little bit more
[2266.04 - 2271.00] the complicated version so um and it
[2269.52 - 2273.28] gets you know and and there's just more
[2271.00 - 2277.76] to it than that too so that that's
[2273.28 - 2281.08] another example migrains I Rel Rel ated
[2277.76 - 2283.64] migraines okay yep I related
[2281.08 - 2286.52] migraines um ocular migraines different
[2283.64 - 2289.32] kinds of migraines um all then affect
[2286.52 - 2291.48] eyes going to the eyes once again viral
[2289.32 - 2293.16] and heavy metals too though so that's a
[2291.48 - 2295.36] whole combination of viral and heavy
[2293.16 - 2296.80] metals shingles virus is one of them
[2295.36 - 2298.96] I've even seen you know I mean the
[2296.80 - 2301.68] Epstein bar too I've even seen other
[2298.96 - 2304.28] things like hhv6 throw that into the the
[2301.68 - 2307.36] mix um you know some people have really
[2304.28 - 2308.96] high versions of you know CMV uh ceglar
[2307.36 - 2311.32] virus and I've seen that kind of amp up
[2308.96 - 2314.20] the anti a little bit as far as creating
[2311.32 - 2317.72] poisons but understand this migraines
[2314.20 - 2319.32] yes viral eye problems from migraines so
[2317.72 - 2320.60] that's a whole another angle a lot of
[2319.32 - 2322.72] people with migraines go to the eye
[2320.60 - 2324.40] doctor all the time eye issues all the
[2322.72 - 2326.44] time they're wondering what's going on
[2324.40 - 2327.80] getting checked all the time so that's
[2326.44 - 2329.28] another example let's talk about
[2327.80 - 2331.20] something else I just I know I always
[2329.28 - 2333.16] run us out a time but we got time we
[2331.20 - 2335.24] still got time hang in there is the seat
[2333.16 - 2337.32] belt still on are you guys hanging in
[2335.24 - 2342.40] there cuz I'm hoping
[2337.32 - 2345.28] so um um sty who gets a sty out there
[2342.40 - 2347.40] who gets chronic sty they're awful
[2345.28 - 2349.12] that's strepa cacus that's strep in the
[2347.40 - 2351.12] system that's strep in the sinuses that
[2349.12 - 2355.44] sit there dormant comes out it causes a
[2351.12 - 2357.12] sty your immune system breaks down um so
[2355.44 - 2359.64] that's that you can even you can even
[2357.12 - 2361.36] put you know e sty are are also from
[2359.64 - 2363.04] fresh strep so strep that you've you
[2361.36 - 2364.96] know you grabbed a door knob in a really
[2363.04 - 2366.68] kind a greasy door knob in kind of a
[2364.96 - 2368.52] really dirty place and then you just had
[2366.68 - 2370.24] your finger in your eye for like 10
[2368.52 - 2373.28] minutes because you decided to rub your
[2370.24 - 2375.64] eye um then you know that that's an easy
[2373.28 - 2380.04] sty coming also I've seen people get the
[2375.64 - 2383.00] flu virus and or colder flu and it it
[2380.04 - 2385.36] directly it dropped the immune system um
[2383.00 - 2388.28] the congestion actually feeds any kind
[2385.36 - 2390.32] of ongoing strepa cacus issue that's
[2388.28 - 2392.28] happening and that sty can break out
[2390.32 - 2393.76] just from the strep so we have a lot of
[2392.28 - 2395.60] strep in our system I'm doing a whole
[2393.76 - 2397.36] show on strep so you know all the
[2395.60 - 2399.12] different ins and outs of it as much as
[2397.36 - 2400.88] I can give you on on you know in a show
[2399.12 - 2404.20] and I'm doing that coming up pretty soon
[2400.88 - 2406.04] so hang in there for that but sty are
[2404.20 - 2408.80] are mostly strep
[2406.04 - 2412.00] related and um and so that's something
[2408.80 - 2414.44] that we got to keep our immune system um
[2412.00 - 2416.36] up zinc got to have your vitamin C you
[2414.44 - 2418.48] know all that has to be there for your
[2416.36 - 2423.12] immune system let's talk about some
[2418.48 - 2426.64] other things too optic nerve issues 100%
[2423.12 - 2428.76] viral 100% viral optic nerve issues
[2426.64 - 2430.08] optic neuritis optic neuritis there's
[2428.76 - 2431.60] all kinds of different nerve issues with
[2430.08 - 2433.12] the optic nerve so when you go to the
[2431.60 - 2434.80] eye doctor and they look and they look
[2433.12 - 2437.40] deep into the nerve they do a test they
[2434.80 - 2439.92] say hey your optic nerves look healthy
[2437.40 - 2442.40] and um if they don't look healthy that's
[2439.92 - 2443.80] a viral infection uh right there Epstein
[2442.40 - 2445.88] bar it's one of the varieties of Epstein
[2443.80 - 2447.88] bar that causes op optic neuritis and
[2445.88 - 2450.16] also different kinds of op optic nerve
[2447.88 - 2452.04] issues um you know you start you know
[2450.16 - 2454.68] start getting problematic issues with an
[2452.04 - 2457.64] eye or one eye or two eyes uh usually
[2454.68 - 2460.68] just one eye with optic nerve issue
[2457.64 - 2462.36] that's viral so we got to go antiviral
[2460.68 - 2464.56] um another reason why the fruits the
[2462.36 - 2469.28] vegetables herb spices the wild foods
[2464.56 - 2471.24] are antiviral it matters so much I'm
[2469.28 - 2472.84] going to blame viral because it's the
[2471.24 - 2474.36] truth of what things are instead of
[2472.84 - 2476.04] blaming you and your body and your
[2474.36 - 2477.80] health so your body being autoimmune
[2476.04 - 2479.68] your body attacking itself I'm not going
[2477.80 - 2481.64] to go that direction I'll never go that
[2479.68 - 2483.24] Direction ever because it's not accurate
[2481.64 - 2485.28] it's completely incorrect I'm going to
[2483.24 - 2488.60] blame the viral issue so you may as well
[2485.28 - 2490.56] learn and know these viral issues and um
[2488.60 - 2492.32] I'm proud of you guys for just being
[2490.56 - 2496.12] here being here and wanting to know the
[2492.32 - 2498.76] truth um so so
[2496.12 - 2501.40] cataracts cataracts is another good one
[2498.76 - 2503.88] that that's pesticide exposure that's
[2501.40 - 2505.80] pesticides building up um if you're
[2503.88 - 2509.04] someone that's had to eat conventional
[2505.80 - 2511.72] food your entire life uh without any
[2509.04 - 2513.92] organic food coming in most likely
[2511.72 - 2517.68] you're heading to heading into some
[2513.92 - 2520.52] cataracts um that's that's an in the
[2517.68 - 2523.16] cataracts believe it or not is also old
[2520.52 - 2526.36] DDT that's in our system from you know
[2523.16 - 2529.40] from uh four fathers and four moms and
[2526.36 - 2532.04] four dads and and uh and um our
[2529.40 - 2534.28] great-grandparents and so forth so you
[2532.04 - 2535.84] know DDT sits in us and it just sits in
[2534.28 - 2537.84] us and sits in us and it gets past the
[2535.84 - 2539.48] generation past the generation it takes
[2537.84 - 2542.08] it might take a hundred generations to
[2539.48 - 2544.16] get DDT out of US unless you adapt or
[2542.08 - 2546.32] know how to get rid of it in
[2544.16 - 2548.76] life-changing Foods book I talk about
[2546.32 - 2551.64] DDT being one of the big culprits still
[2548.76 - 2553.60] today um you know not just the heavy
[2551.64 - 2555.68] metals but that too DDT and other
[2553.60 - 2558.40] pesticides and herbicides cataracts is
[2555.68 - 2562.84] pesticide herbicide and old DDT that's
[2558.40 - 2564.36] what it is in your system um so you know
[2562.84 - 2567.08] that's something to to understand so
[2564.36 - 2569.64] it's about taking out it's about taking
[2567.08 - 2572.04] out all the uh pesticides all the
[2569.64 - 2574.20] herbicides we can out of the body with
[2572.04 - 2577.28] the right kind of foods you know and
[2574.20 - 2579.36] that matters too so
[2577.28 - 2584.32] a lot of eye problems in general you
[2579.36 - 2587.08] know are um are fixable fixable fixable
[2584.32 - 2589.76] a lot of eye injuries um tend to not be
[2587.08 - 2592.36] as easy to fix but we can still support
[2589.76 - 2593.44] the eye we have left or both eyes if
[2592.36 - 2599.08] they're
[2593.44 - 2603.64] injured um so dryness ey dryness welcome
[2599.08 - 2607.64] to adrenal issues welcome to adrenal
[2603.64 - 2610.80] issues with dry eyes dry minus and stuff
[2607.64 - 2612.96] that's a big piece of it big piece of it
[2610.80 - 2615.00] um adrenals have a big role it's not the
[2612.96 - 2617.76] entire reason some people get dry eyes
[2615.00 - 2620.28] because they get blockages in the Ducks
[2617.76 - 2622.48] um you know these these blockages are
[2620.28 - 2625.64] from low-grade bacterial infections such
[2622.48 - 2627.24] as strep and even staff staff's actually
[2625.64 - 2629.68] another one that gets in the eye that
[2627.24 - 2632.16] can cause a sty too it's not just 100%
[2629.68 - 2634.20] strep but it's close but sty actually
[2632.16 - 2637.36] you know can be can be staffed too I
[2634.20 - 2640.32] forgot to tell you guys that olizee and
[2637.36 - 2641.96] um so dry eyes got to get your adrenal
[2640.32 - 2644.16] strong without a doubt see it's all
[2641.96 - 2646.08] about adrenal Health look you know maybe
[2644.16 - 2647.44] listen to the older uh adrenal Health
[2646.08 - 2649.60] show we're doing another adrenal Health
[2647.44 - 2651.64] show eventually so we support the
[2649.60 - 2653.20] adrenals for that let's talk about Foods
[2651.64 - 2655.12] let's talk about supplements for the
[2653.20 - 2657.04] eyes bringing eyes back let's do that
[2655.12 - 2660.20] while we have a little time left wild
[2657.04 - 2664.04] blueberries yes wild blueberries most
[2660.20 - 2666.80] powerful number one eye food there is in
[2664.04 - 2669.04] the world nothing else can touch it
[2666.80 - 2671.32] nothing nothing nothing there's no weed
[2669.04 - 2672.96] in the jungle I'm just sorry to say
[2671.32 - 2674.56] there's nothing in the rainforest that
[2672.96 - 2676.08] can touch the wild blueberry there's a
[2674.56 - 2677.72] there's powerful stuff in the rainforest
[2676.08 - 2680.92] there's amazing things in the jungle
[2677.72 - 2683.04] absolutely but nothing can touch the
[2680.92 - 2685.68] strength of the wild blueberry it's the
[2683.04 - 2687.92] most powerful food on planet Earth today
[2685.68 - 2690.24] I have to make sure you know that in
[2687.92 - 2692.24] this time why I'm here on this planet
[2690.24 - 2694.00] you know before I leave I have to make
[2692.24 - 2696.76] sure you know what the most powerful
[2694.00 - 2699.20] food is on the planet I do a whole
[2696.76 - 2703.48] section in life-changing Foods about
[2699.20 - 2706.48] that that's a good food uh mango is a
[2703.48 - 2709.36] good food is a good food that's a great
[2706.48 - 2711.76] one for eyes let me tell you though you
[2709.36 - 2713.84] know um Spirit has has given me
[2711.76 - 2715.84] information of what mango does for all
[2713.84 - 2717.72] kinds of illnesses and diseases I put it
