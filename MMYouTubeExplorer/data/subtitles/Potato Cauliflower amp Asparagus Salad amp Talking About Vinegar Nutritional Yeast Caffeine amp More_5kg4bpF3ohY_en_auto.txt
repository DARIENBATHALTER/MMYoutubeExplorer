[8.72 - 11.92] greens how to incorporate them into your
[10.40 - 12.88] life i'm also going to be talking about
[11.92 - 14.96] vinegar

[14.96 - 19.44] vinegars i'm going to talk about
[16.64 - 20.64] eggs so i'm going to do a little whole
[19.44 - 22.64] thing about eggs too
[20.64 - 24.72] so hey and gluten going to talk about
[22.64 - 27.36] gluten that's just a few things
[24.72 - 30.24] and so you don't want to miss this live
[27.36 - 33.36] and let's get started
[30.24 - 35.76] so you guys uh what i'm doing is i'm

[40.72 - 45.20] asparagus i'm going to chop some up
[42.08 - 46.56] right now and
[45.20 - 48.56] so basically what i'm going to do is
[46.56 - 50.08] some lightly steamed asparagus and
[48.56 - 51.04] cauliflower is going to go on top of
[50.08 - 54.00] this potato
[51.04 - 55.20] leafy green salad so i'm excited about
[54.00 - 57.44] this
[55.20 - 59.68] i don't want the asparagus to be real
[57.44 - 62.48] small i want it to be kind of hunkier
[59.68 - 62.48] pieces so
[62.64 - 66.96] that's how i'm doing them here you know
[65.60 - 69.12] you don't want to chop them so
[66.96 - 70.40] tiny where they're in the smallest
[69.12 - 71.84] pieces
[70.40 - 73.76] good to see you guys coming on we're
[71.84 - 76.16] going to talk about eggs
[73.76 - 77.12] we're going to talk about apple cider
[76.16 - 80.24] vinegar
[77.12 - 81.92] might talk about b12 as well so we'll do
[80.24 - 84.48] a little b12 talk
[81.92 - 85.88] how it works inside the body what
[84.48 - 87.76] happens how to kind of like
[85.88 - 93.92] self-diagnose
[87.76 - 97.76] all right be your own intuitive healer
[93.92 - 97.76] so give you like tips on that
[99.20 - 103.36] i'm gonna talk about gluten too as well
[101.36 - 104.72] because you know hey
[103.36 - 106.56] even though people say they're gluten
[104.72 - 108.16] free a lot of people they end up getting
[106.56 - 109.20] gluten inside of them you know they end
[108.16 - 112.16] up eating gluten
[109.20 - 112.16] happens all the time
[112.24 - 115.52] um i was talking to a doctor the other
[114.32 - 117.36] day and he said to me
[115.52 - 118.80] he's teaching his patients how to
[117.36 - 121.52] self-diagnose
[118.80 - 122.64] that's what he told me i'm like really
[121.52 - 124.16] you're a doctor
[122.64 - 127.36] you're teaching them to do that he says
[124.16 - 129.84] yeah i'm teaching them to
[127.36 - 132.24] kind of have a feel as to hey when do i
[129.84 - 135.36] go need to see a doctor
[132.24 - 137.36] you know what's my symptoms learning
[135.36 - 139.52] about their symptoms and stuff so
[137.36 - 141.28] it's a cool doctor really it's teaching
[139.52 - 143.84] people how to take care of themselves a
[141.28 - 143.84] little bit
[146.56 - 149.92] dr phone md
[154.80 - 158.80] danielle says hi i can't heal histamine
[157.36 - 163.44] intolerance
[158.80 - 163.44] even even using your cleanse
[163.68 - 167.36] what what else are you doing is it just
[166.16 - 169.76] a cleanse did you do
[167.36 - 170.64] one cleanse did you do a little
[169.76 - 174.00] cleansing
[170.64 - 176.64] have you did the 369 advance
[174.00 - 177.52] have you done that so that's something
[176.64 - 181.04] to
[177.52 - 183.36] think about um how much fat are you on
[181.04 - 185.28] that's another thing too when you get
[183.36 - 187.12] off the cleanse are you tanking the fats
[185.28 - 188.64] are you taking the nuts and seeds nut
[187.12 - 191.44] butters oils
[188.64 - 192.48] avocado are you doing anything else are
[191.44 - 194.24] you doing animal
[192.48 - 195.76] animal fats at all are you doing that
[194.24 - 196.88] i'm cutting the cauliflower in half
[195.76 - 199.84] these these little
[196.88 - 199.84] florets right here
[201.76 - 209.20] and is your histamine issue
[205.60 - 211.68] really part of your issue that's another
[209.20 - 213.84] thing too
[211.68 - 215.44] is it just is it something someone's
[213.84 - 217.04] just told you about hey you got high
[215.44 - 218.08] histamines that could be your problem
[217.04 - 219.52] are you
[218.08 - 222.08] are you dealing with something else are
[219.52 - 224.40] you dealing with some kind of viral load
[222.08 - 226.24] so you're dealing with a viral problem
[224.40 - 228.00] and you got a lot of symptoms
[226.24 - 229.76] did you read the cleanse the heal book
[228.00 - 232.96] and kind of get it
[229.76 - 234.72] in some insight to what could be wrong
[232.96 - 236.56] have you done the mono eating if you're
[234.72 - 239.04] really worried about histamines maybe do
[236.56 - 241.76] the mono eating how about that
[239.04 - 243.60] that would be a good thing to do um i
[241.76 - 245.44] just put some
[243.60 - 246.72] cauliflower right here in the pan i got
[245.44 - 248.24] some asparagus so i'm just going to
[246.72 - 250.16] lightly steam this up this is going to
[248.24 - 251.60] go in the salad
[250.16 - 253.12] the salad is going to be really big
[251.60 - 255.84] actually there's a lot going on with
[253.12 - 259.36] this i got a lot of stuff here
[255.84 - 261.60] um what do you do about post covet
[259.36 - 263.20] symptoms i saw that question
[261.60 - 265.44] um a lot of people are asking about what
[263.20 - 268.48] do you do about that stuff
[265.44 - 270.96] you know the funny thing is is in
[268.48 - 272.00] medical medium new edition revised and
[270.96 - 274.24] expanded
[272.00 - 275.68] i have a whole section about the plague
[274.24 - 276.32] about what happens the effects with
[275.68 - 278.48] people
[276.32 - 279.36] the aftermath all of this stuff so it's
[278.48 - 283.84] in here
[279.36 - 283.84] so this is on amazon.com
[284.16 - 287.28] link is in the description
[288.80 - 292.16] so i got some cauliflower some asparagus
[290.64 - 293.44] going here so if you guys just got on
[292.16 - 294.56] here everybody coming on here going to
[293.44 - 296.96] talk about
[294.56 - 298.88] um i'm going to talk about gluten going
[296.96 - 300.48] to talk about b12 going to talk about
[298.88 - 301.92] eggs i'm going to talk about apple cider
[300.48 - 303.36] vinegar and other vinegars
[301.92 - 305.44] that's just some of the stuff and cover
[303.36 - 306.64] caffeine a little bit again so we're
[305.44 - 307.84] going to cover a whole bunch of
[306.64 - 309.60] different things
[307.84 - 312.00] lots of stuff to talk about when it
[309.60 - 314.08] comes down to histamines
[312.00 - 315.60] the reason why someone has a histamine
[314.08 - 318.40] problem is because they're viral
[315.60 - 319.12] so you got to keep that in mind so if
[318.40 - 322.72] someone
[319.12 - 325.12] is viral low-grade viral infections
[322.72 - 325.92] then your histamines raise and then what
[325.12 - 328.32] happens is
[325.92 - 330.40] the foods they're really just kind of a
[328.32 - 332.80] confusion they become a confusion
[330.40 - 334.64] in in it all but first of all certain
[332.80 - 338.24] foods will feed the viruses
[334.64 - 338.96] creating more histamines so and certain
[338.24 - 341.76] foods will
[338.96 - 344.56] kill the epstein-barr virus in shingles
[341.76 - 348.08] virus cytomegalovirus simplex one virus
[344.56 - 349.68] causing histamines so if if histamines
[348.08 - 351.44] is something that you're monitoring or
[349.68 - 353.12] someone's looking after your doctor's
[351.44 - 354.48] looking after these histamines and
[353.12 - 356.80] they're all worried about histamines
[354.48 - 358.80] histamines but they don't know
[356.80 - 360.56] what is happening like what's causing
[358.80 - 361.36] the histamines why are these histamines
[360.56 - 363.84] happening
[361.36 - 365.60] so if you're eating foods to feed
[363.84 - 366.16] pathogens like epstein-barr shingle
[365.60 - 370.32] sediment
[366.16 - 372.88] virus hhv6 hhv7 simplex one simplex two
[370.32 - 375.36] and the list goes on if you're eating
[372.88 - 376.64] foods to feed some of these bugs in your
[375.36 - 380.00] body
[376.64 - 383.52] then histamines raise right
[380.00 - 384.72] then when you eat foods to cleanse these
[383.52 - 386.88] bugs out
[384.72 - 388.48] histamines raise because you're
[386.88 - 390.24] cleansing and shaking up all that
[388.48 - 391.36] garbage and toxic stuff that's sitting
[390.24 - 393.52] inside your liver
[391.36 - 394.48] so if you're trying a little bit of a
[393.52 - 396.32] cleanse like
[394.48 - 397.76] like the cleanse the heel one of one of
[396.32 - 398.56] the cleanses or you're doing a little
[397.76 - 400.64] 3-6-9
[398.56 - 402.40] and you're not sure where to go it takes
[400.64 - 404.00] time because that liver is really mucky
[402.40 - 405.68] really dirty filled with all kinds of
[404.00 - 407.60] toxins filled with all kinds of bugs
[405.68 - 410.56] with all kinds of pathogens
[407.60 - 411.84] and it's just it's stocked up in there
[410.56 - 413.28] and then what happens when you start
[411.84 - 414.56] cleansing and cleansing it out you're
[413.28 - 416.08] getting all that garbage out and that
[414.56 - 417.76] could raise your histamines
[416.08 - 419.28] just like the histamines were raised to
[417.76 - 422.08] begin with because of all that garbage
[419.28 - 423.84] building up
[422.08 - 425.36] invite the light said i think i i think
[423.84 - 427.60] potatoes bother me
[425.36 - 429.36] bummer i'm making a potato dish making a
[427.60 - 430.80] leafy green salad if you want to just
[429.36 - 432.48] keep the cauliflower
[430.80 - 434.84] and the asparagus in there without the
[432.48 - 438.00] potato you're welcome to
[434.84 - 441.04] um but potatoes
[438.00 - 443.52] don't feed bugs it's really healing food
[441.04 - 447.36] healing food on the digestive system
[443.52 - 447.36] um very healing
[447.84 - 450.96] what other foods are you eating invite
[449.36 - 452.96] the light is there anything else
[450.96 - 454.40] you you know you're doing you're staying
[452.96 - 455.60] away from vinegar staying away from the
[454.40 - 458.32] nutritional yeast right
[455.60 - 459.76] staying away from those things um stay
[458.32 - 461.36] away from gluten of course you're off
[459.76 - 462.64] the caffeine right staying away from the
[461.36 - 463.60] caffeine so you don't burn out the
[462.64 - 465.52] adrenals
[463.60 - 468.32] staying off the milk cheese eggs butter
[465.52 - 468.32] all that's gone
[473.60 - 477.28] and any new pharmaceuticals happening a
[476.08 - 479.12] lot of people
[477.28 - 481.04] they'll do new pharmaceuticals and all
[479.12 - 482.48] of a sudden something's going on and
[481.04 - 483.92] they're like what is it is it my food
[482.48 - 485.28] meanwhile they had a new pharmaceutical
[483.92 - 488.48] going on
[485.28 - 490.24] so i got this about the steam up
[488.48 - 493.84] lightly steaming some cauliflower got
[490.24 - 493.84] some asparagus right here
[493.92 - 498.56] so another thing about histamines if you
[497.04 - 500.08] have old pharmaceuticals sitting inside
[498.56 - 501.92] your liver and organs
[500.08 - 504.84] you got benzodiazepines in there you got
[501.92 - 506.72] old cold medicines in there antibiotics
[504.84 - 508.16] anti-inflammatories whatever you have
[506.72 - 509.84] that's still anti-depressants
[508.16 - 511.60] anti-anxiety meds whatever you have
[509.84 - 513.68] that's sitting in your liver
[511.60 - 515.04] that stuff starts to come out those
[513.68 - 518.40] histamines go up
[515.04 - 521.44] up and histamine levels are kind of like
[518.40 - 523.20] keeping an eye on just a marker like
[521.44 - 526.40] what's going on inside the body nobody
[523.20 - 529.28] knows but the histamines up
[526.40 - 529.84] glad you guys are coming on there's no
[529.28 - 531.92] oil
[529.84 - 534.32] in this steaming it up just got some
[531.92 - 536.32] water in the pan
[534.32 - 539.28] waiting for that to get hot so i'm going
[536.32 - 541.52] to start cutting some leafy greens
[539.28 - 543.28] and making this out i got some spinach
[541.52 - 544.72] right here
[543.28 - 546.72] you can leave them whole leaf i'm just
[544.72 - 549.44] going to chop them up a little bit
[546.72 - 551.36] because this is a really big salad so
[549.44 - 554.80] it'll help to
[551.36 - 554.80] make it a little smaller in a way
[555.44 - 558.96] you guys ready to talk about some stuff
[559.44 - 564.88] let me just get some spinach in this
[562.08 - 564.88] bowl right here
[568.16 - 572.24] you guys have you ever noticed when i'm
[570.80 - 575.12] making meals for you
[572.24 - 575.76] it's rare there's a fat in the meal
[575.12 - 577.44] right
[575.76 - 579.92] you don't see any cheese thrown on top
[577.44 - 581.84] of here which is fat you don't see eggs
[579.92 - 583.20] thrown on top of here hard-boiled eggs
[581.84 - 585.76] right you don't see that
[583.20 - 587.52] okay you don't see any nut butters you
[585.76 - 589.04] don't see tahini on here
[587.52 - 591.12] you don't see avocado it's not that
[589.04 - 591.92] avocado's bad for you avocado's not bad
[591.12 - 594.08] for you
[591.92 - 596.48] it's just you don't see that because
[594.08 - 599.36] here's the thing everybody is eating fat
[596.48 - 600.48] all day long almost every single meal
[599.36 - 602.64] they eat
[600.48 - 604.16] has a fat in it right and then their
[602.64 - 605.44] livers get burdened down and they get
[604.16 - 606.08] the weight later and they get the
[605.44 - 607.76] stagnant
[606.08 - 609.76] sluggish liver they get the depression
[607.76 - 611.12] the metals oxidized they got all kinds
[609.76 - 614.80] of problems
[611.12 - 618.08] and what happens here is
[614.80 - 620.72] the reason why i do all these no fat
[618.08 - 622.16] meals i'm hoping that you guys maybe
[620.72 - 623.12] make one and you're like hey that was
[622.16 - 625.52] really good i didn't
[623.12 - 627.20] need to drown that with oil i didn't
[625.52 - 629.60] need to drown that with
[627.20 - 630.72] you know lots of nut butter or avocado i
[629.60 - 632.80] didn't need to put
[630.72 - 634.16] cheese on top or anything like that so
[632.80 - 635.84] i'm putting spinach in here i just
[634.16 - 637.60] chopped up some spinach right here
[635.84 - 639.04] so leafy greens are critical these are
[637.60 - 641.12] trace mineral salts just so you know
[639.04 - 642.88] this goes to the brain
[641.12 - 646.08] this is good for the brain which is
[642.88 - 648.24] leading me to the egg topic pretty soon
[646.08 - 649.12] um i just want to show you guys how to
[648.24 - 652.40] make healing
[649.12 - 653.20] meals that don't have vinegar loads of
[652.40 - 655.60] salt
[653.20 - 656.88] all these fats all these oils all this
[655.60 - 659.60] nutritional yeast
[656.88 - 660.40] i want you guys to have a chance to heal
[659.60 - 662.56] and not be
[660.40 - 664.40] have to inundate yourself on all with
[662.56 - 667.84] all this stuff in there like
[664.40 - 670.64] vinegars and fats and oils and salts and
[667.84 - 672.00] like because i want you guys to have a
[670.64 - 674.32] chance to really heal
[672.00 - 676.08] learn how to heal take care of yourself
[674.32 - 679.76] i don't want to throw all that stuff in
[676.08 - 679.76] this stuff then you guys don't heal
[679.84 - 682.64] i'm going to chop up a little bit of
[681.04 - 684.32] parsley right here why is nutritional
[682.64 - 687.60] yeast bad
[684.32 - 689.44] it's a neural antagonist it's irritating
[687.60 - 691.36] on the nerves it's irritating on the
[689.44 - 693.20] central nervous system it's irritating
[691.36 - 696.24] on neurons
[693.20 - 696.24] nutritional yeast
[696.32 - 700.16] has a glutamic acid naturally embedded
[699.12 - 702.32] into it
[700.16 - 703.92] that's just one reason why it's it's not
[702.32 - 708.48] that good
[703.92 - 712.00] that glutamic acid attaches itself
[708.48 - 714.16] to neurons wreaking havoc
[712.00 - 715.68] okay okay i'll give you a couple other
[714.16 - 716.00] things it does all right let's go into
[715.68 - 717.44] that
[716.00 - 719.04] let's talk about nutritional yeast a
[717.44 - 721.28] little bit that was on my list today by
[719.04 - 721.28] the way
[721.36 - 724.88] chopping up parsley it's going in my
[722.80 - 726.40] leafy leafy green salad if you guys just
[724.88 - 730.64] came on here i got cauliflower i got
[726.40 - 731.92] asparagus steaming up in here so
[730.64 - 733.76] just going to kind of move it around a
[731.92 - 736.24] little bit i got this steaming up
[733.76 - 737.84] this is going to go on top of the salad
[736.24 - 738.32] it's going to lightly lightly steam
[737.84 - 741.60] these
[738.32 - 742.48] for a little while nutritional yeast not
[741.60 - 746.08] only has
[742.48 - 746.08] a natural glutamic acid
[748.48 - 754.80] that's a problem putting some
[751.68 - 754.80] parsley in the salad
[756.24 - 759.44] it's also an irritant to the intestinal
[758.24 - 761.20] lining
[759.44 - 763.20] so nutritional yeast is an irritant to
[761.20 - 764.80] the intestinal lining if you want ibs
[763.20 - 765.84] and digestive problems to get worse due
[764.80 - 768.48] to nutritional yeast
[765.84 - 769.84] it's one thing right there these are
[768.48 - 771.12] sunflower sprouts
[769.84 - 772.56] if you guys just came on we're going to
[771.12 - 775.04] be hammering nutritional yeast for a
[772.56 - 775.04] little while
[775.60 - 779.20] so sunflower sprouts these are really
[777.28 - 782.08] pretty
[779.20 - 783.52] right don't they look great i'm going to
[782.08 - 785.60] chop up some of these put these in a
[783.52 - 787.36] salad
[785.60 - 789.12] here's another reason why nutritional
[787.36 - 791.52] yeast really stinks everybody says b12
[789.12 - 792.72] is a nutritional yeast b12 b12 no they
[791.52 - 795.68] add it
[792.72 - 796.32] and they add a really bad one so they
[795.68 - 799.60] add a
[796.32 - 802.40] toxic type of b12 a synthetic b12
[799.60 - 805.04] that's toxic that's what they add so you
[802.40 - 809.20] got to think about this right
[805.04 - 812.80] my acupuncturist says heavy metal detox
[809.20 - 815.60] smoothie is too cold for me and it's
[812.80 - 816.56] quenching my digestion fire i use frozen
[815.60 - 817.76] bananas
[816.56 - 820.96] boy there's a lot of science and
[817.76 - 820.96] research in that one huh
[821.44 - 825.44] i wonder what scientific study or test
[823.20 - 826.08] determines your fire and your gut as
[825.44 - 829.12] being
[826.08 - 830.32] being quenching you're firing your guts
[829.12 - 833.68] being quenching by
[830.32 - 833.68] the heavy metal detox smoothie
[835.60 - 841.44] look i'm not gonna pick on your
[838.32 - 843.36] acupuncturist okay
[841.44 - 844.96] but i've talked to thousands of them in
[843.36 - 849.12] the last 35 years
[844.96 - 851.28] and their training is about hot and cold
[849.12 - 852.96] liver heat dampness spleen dampness
[851.28 - 856.16] pancreas dampness
[852.96 - 857.20] fire okay and so that's what their
[856.16 - 860.88] training's in
[857.20 - 862.32] right and i'm not ranking on that at all
[860.88 - 864.88] i got a lot of close friends that are
[862.32 - 866.80] acupuncturists with three decades of
[864.88 - 870.80] practice underneath them
[866.80 - 873.92] it's not not it
[870.80 - 877.28] it's just that i always go by one rule
[873.92 - 880.72] and one rule only do you know
[877.28 - 882.64] why someone is really sick because
[880.72 - 884.72] millions of people have been at two
[882.64 - 887.84] their acupuncturists
[884.72 - 892.48] and haven't recovered from severe lupus
[887.84 - 895.68] multiple sclerosis okay crohn's colitis
[892.48 - 896.56] eczema psoriasis i have not seen a
[895.68 - 898.96] severe
[896.56 - 900.48] case of eczema one where the person's
[898.96 - 902.16] raging with eczema
[900.48 - 904.40] and they can't live their life i have
[902.16 - 908.16] not seen that dampest spleen
[904.40 - 908.16] hot cold fire
[908.40 - 912.08] fix it whether they're taking away cold
[911.44 - 914.16] foods
[912.08 - 916.00] putting in hot foods never seen because
[914.16 - 917.36] the reason why unless you know why
[916.00 - 918.48] someone has eczema
[917.36 - 920.32] unless you know why someone has
[918.48 - 921.92] psoriasis you can play all the guessing
[920.32 - 923.68] games you want
[921.92 - 925.12] and it's not going to fix somebody i
[923.68 - 926.48] can't tell you how many people with
[925.12 - 929.60] raging eczema has laid
[926.48 - 932.00] they've laid on an acupuncturist table
[929.60 - 934.32] suffered through the needles told to
[932.00 - 936.64] stay away from anything cold because of
[934.32 - 938.96] dampness in the spleen
[936.64 - 940.80] and that and then they just that wasn't
[938.96 - 944.40] an answer
[940.80 - 944.40] i'm not trying to be difficult
[945.20 - 951.60] i got a lot of respect for practitioners
[948.88 - 951.60] of all kinds
[951.68 - 955.84] a lot of respect
[958.88 - 962.16] what i would do is the first thing i
[960.24 - 965.44] would do is don't have it icy cold
[962.16 - 965.44] defrost the blueberries
[966.00 - 969.76] but see your acupuncturist might not
[967.84 - 971.36] want you doing raw foods
[969.76 - 973.12] so that might be an issue too a lot of
[971.36 - 974.24] acupuncturists be like no only cook
[973.12 - 978.80] don't do anything raw
[974.24 - 982.00] no raw foods only cook only cooked
[978.80 - 984.00] so a lot of a lot of um
[982.00 - 985.68] acupuncturists might do that but if if
[984.00 - 988.00] the concern is about it being
[985.68 - 988.72] cold have the wild blueberries out
[988.00 - 990.88] overnight
[988.72 - 992.56] let them defrost let them become room
[990.88 - 997.84] temperature make sure your bananas are
[992.56 - 997.84] room temperature
[999.04 - 1002.80] does your acupuncturist know that if you
[1001.12 - 1004.48] have toxic heavy metals it causes
[1002.80 - 1006.40] anxiety depression no they don't
[1004.48 - 1007.84] because they had never been taught that
[1006.40 - 1009.92] so
[1007.84 - 1011.52] if you have anxiety depression bipolar
[1009.92 - 1014.08] ocd parkinson's
[1011.52 - 1015.76] memory issues alzheimer's dementia the
[1014.08 - 1019.44] list goes on to personalization
[1015.76 - 1021.76] that's caused by toxic heavy metals so
[1019.44 - 1025.84] the thing is is like i'm not saying you
[1021.76 - 1027.60] have one of those conditions but if you
[1025.84 - 1028.88] if you go to an acupuncturist and they
[1027.60 - 1031.60] say you can't have
[1028.88 - 1032.80] a smoothie because of dampness of the
[1031.60 - 1034.16] spleen or something
[1032.80 - 1036.08] and you're sitting there with severe
[1034.16 - 1038.24] depression anxiety to personalization
[1036.08 - 1041.44] alzheimer's dementia
[1038.24 - 1043.12] you're not going to get any help because
[1041.44 - 1044.64] you got to get the medals out but the
[1043.12 - 1046.00] acupuncturist doesn't know that you need
[1044.64 - 1046.88] to get your metals out you see how it
[1046.00 - 1050.16] works
[1046.88 - 1050.16] just think about that a little bit
[1051.36 - 1055.52] i've never met an acupuncturist in 35
[1053.84 - 1057.68] years of doing this work that knew about
[1055.52 - 1059.36] viruses
[1057.68 - 1060.88] they know about them now through the
[1059.36 - 1062.24] work of the medical medium and all the
[1060.88 - 1064.08] books that are out there millions of
[1062.24 - 1066.00] books getting out there
[1064.08 - 1067.12] but they never knew i'll tell you i'll
[1066.00 - 1068.40] tell you i talked to the best
[1067.12 - 1070.08] acupuncturist schools
[1068.40 - 1073.04] some of the leaders in the best actual
[1070.08 - 1076.48] acupuncture schools in the last 35 years
[1073.04 - 1078.00] they didn't know viruses caused anything
[1076.48 - 1079.28] they didn't know about the epstein-barr
[1078.00 - 1080.64] virus and what it caused they didn't
[1079.28 - 1081.84] know about shingles and what it caused
[1080.64 - 1083.36] trigeminal neuralgia
[1081.84 - 1085.28] they didn't know chronic fatigue
[1083.36 - 1087.44] syndrome me they didn't know multiple
[1085.28 - 1090.08] sclerosis was caused by epstein-barr
[1087.44 - 1092.40] i've talked to leaders of the movement
[1090.08 - 1096.00] over the last 35 years in acupuncture
[1092.40 - 1097.84] schools and and they didn't know what
[1096.00 - 1099.44] causes those things they were kind of
[1097.84 - 1100.16] like just trained in one way where it's
[1099.44 - 1102.08] all about
[1100.16 - 1104.48] the meridians it's all about the
[1102.08 - 1107.04] pressure points it's all about
[1104.48 - 1108.96] it's all about dampness of the spleen
[1107.04 - 1109.36] it's all about that kind of stuff and i
[1108.96 - 1111.76] i
[1109.36 - 1113.84] got total respect for that i'm not i'm
[1111.76 - 1116.72] that's not i'm not judging anybody
[1113.84 - 1117.28] it's just that i've had to teach a lot a
[1116.72 - 1120.16] lot of
[1117.28 - 1120.80] high ranking people in the field of that
[1120.16 - 1123.04] medicine
[1120.80 - 1124.56] about viruses and why their patients
[1123.04 - 1126.48] were suffering with chronic fatigue
[1124.56 - 1130.00] syndrome fibromyalgia
[1126.48 - 1133.04] pots rinald syndrome
[1130.00 - 1133.04] lupus whatever
[1133.76 - 1137.84] this is steaming up it's coming out good
[1136.56 - 1140.16] a little longer than that
[1137.84 - 1140.16] um
[1141.04 - 1144.32] i'm going to put a little celery chopped
[1142.72 - 1146.96] up celery in this real quick
[1144.32 - 1146.96] let me do that
[1147.84 - 1152.40] i'm all about the real problems you know
[1150.32 - 1155.52] the real issues to get better
[1152.40 - 1155.52] see what happened was
[1158.48 - 1162.24] i had to talk to 250 000 individuals
[1161.04 - 1164.32] one-on-one
[1162.24 - 1166.48] before the publications of medical media
[1164.32 - 1168.00] medical medium books
[1166.48 - 1169.84] and they already went to every single
[1168.00 - 1170.80] practice some 30 doctors and different
[1169.84 - 1173.84] practitioners some
[1170.80 - 1176.56] 50 doctors and the reason why
[1173.84 - 1178.24] i even i'm even doing what i'm doing all
[1176.56 - 1180.00] these years was because doctors and
[1178.24 - 1181.92] practitioners and acupuncturists and
[1180.00 - 1184.16] nutritionists and naturopaths
[1181.92 - 1185.84] sent people to me with bizarre symptoms
[1184.16 - 1188.32] tingles and numbness aches and pains
[1185.84 - 1190.16] ringing in the ears vertigo skin
[1188.32 - 1191.60] disorders of all kinds intestinal
[1190.16 - 1194.08] disorders of all kind with no
[1191.60 - 1194.08] answers
[1197.44 - 1200.40] you don't think i've heard that a
[1198.48 - 1202.24] million times don't drink a smoothie a
[1200.40 - 1206.32] cold smoothie because it's gonna
[1202.24 - 1207.68] blow your fire out all right well
[1206.32 - 1209.84] don't eat a smoothie that's going to
[1207.68 - 1210.88] help get the metals out kill off viruses
[1209.84 - 1214.08] and clean things up
[1210.88 - 1214.08] so you can actually get better
[1218.16 - 1222.08] viruses and bacteria inflame nerves they
[1220.24 - 1223.76] inflame the intestinal tract that's the
[1222.08 - 1226.40] real issues that's what happens deep
[1223.76 - 1226.40] down inside
[1230.08 - 1236.16] and then your hydrochloric acid weakens
[1234.64 - 1238.48] that's what causes weakness of the
[1236.16 - 1241.04] digestion your hcl blows out
[1238.48 - 1241.04] caffeine
[1242.88 - 1247.60] you want to blow out your hcl
[1246.24 - 1249.60] just get that liver stagnant and
[1247.60 - 1251.76] sluggish fill it with fat
[1249.60 - 1253.28] here's the here's the sad thing right
[1251.76 - 1255.28] everybody's inundating everybody with
[1253.28 - 1256.00] fat so every single practitioner every
[1255.28 - 1257.92] single
[1256.00 - 1259.68] every single nutritionist every single
[1257.92 - 1261.36] doctor they're all about high fat high
[1259.68 - 1263.36] fat eat lots of fat then you blow out
[1261.36 - 1263.84] your liver you weaken your hcl and you
[1263.36 - 1266.08] just stay
[1263.84 - 1266.08] sick

[1284.32 - 1288.80] your diet these are leafy greens a
[1285.60 - 1288.80] little spinach left over
[1288.96 - 1293.92] i'm gonna do a little bit more parsley
[1291.04 - 1293.92] inside the salad
[1294.08 - 1298.48] those are pea sprouts i said sunflowers
[1295.84 - 1300.96] bro i have a whole bunch of sunflower
[1298.48 - 1300.96] sprouts
[1301.28 - 1307.68] but those are those are pea sprouts
[1304.88 - 1307.68] sorry about that
[1308.08 - 1311.44] i'm making a potato salad steamed

[1314.24 - 1317.60] got tomatoes here
[1316.24 - 1318.96] i'm making sure there's lots of leafy
[1317.60 - 1320.40] greens because of the mineral salts for
[1318.96 - 1324.16] your brain
[1320.40 - 1325.92] make you think clear you don't have to
[1324.16 - 1327.52] be on caffeine for the rest of your life
[1325.92 - 1333.84] when you get enough mineral salts over

[1338.48 - 1341.68] they're told to eat fat you can't get
[1340.08 - 1343.52] off of it it's an addiction because what
[1341.68 - 1345.92] you do is the more fat you eat
[1343.52 - 1347.36] the more your adrenals have to actually
[1345.92 - 1348.56] thin out your blood so you're high in
[1347.36 - 1351.28] adrenaline
[1348.56 - 1352.40] the more fat you intake in your foods
[1351.28 - 1355.60] milk cheese butter
[1352.40 - 1358.80] eggs pork
[1355.60 - 1361.28] beef chicken not saying you know

[1365.12 - 1372.24] olive oil right
[1368.40 - 1373.68] avocado the more fats you do
[1372.24 - 1375.44] the more your adrenals have to
[1373.68 - 1376.16] overcompensate and have to thin out your
[1375.44 - 1378.24] blood
[1376.16 - 1379.52] if you fill your bloodstream up with fat
[1378.24 - 1381.12] all day long that's what everybody's
[1379.52 - 1382.32] doing including chocolate that's another
[1381.12 - 1385.44] one
[1382.32 - 1388.48] you're forcing your liver
[1385.44 - 1390.16] to produce all this bile to try to thin
[1388.48 - 1392.32] out the blood all this bile
[1390.16 - 1394.00] you're forcing your adrenals to pump out
[1392.32 - 1394.80] all this epinephrine to thin out your
[1394.00 - 1397.36] blood
[1394.80 - 1398.96] you become this blood thinning machine
[1397.36 - 1400.88] your whole body's purpose
[1398.96 - 1402.64] is to thin out your blood you guys so
[1400.88 - 1404.24] when you're doing fat all day long fat
[1402.64 - 1405.12] for breakfast fat for lunch fat in the
[1404.24 - 1406.96] middle of the afternoon
[1405.12 - 1408.80] all your chocolate fat at night for
[1406.96 - 1410.96] dinner all your chicken
[1408.80 - 1412.88] it you got to lower the fats because
[1410.96 - 1415.44] you're walking around with your body
[1412.88 - 1416.00] trying to thin out the blood constantly
[1415.44 - 1418.96] that's what you're
[1416.00 - 1420.40] doing your body's killing itself to thin
[1418.96 - 1422.56] out your blood
[1420.40 - 1424.96] all that epinephrine is cranking out of
[1422.56 - 1426.88] your adrenals to thin out your blood
[1424.96 - 1428.56] your liver is pumping all this bile to
[1426.88 - 1430.08] break down the fat to thin out your
[1428.56 - 1432.88] blood you know why
[1430.08 - 1433.76] because fat in your blood takes out all
[1432.88 - 1436.72] your oxygen
[1433.76 - 1438.56] and your brain starves of the oxygen and
[1436.72 - 1440.08] once your brain starves at the oxygen
[1438.56 - 1441.68] your adrenals are flooding all this
[1440.08 - 1443.28] adrenaline we gotta thin this out we
[1441.68 - 1444.96] gotta thin out this blood
[1443.28 - 1446.88] and everybody's walking around like a
[1444.96 - 1449.28] time bomb a time bomb
[1446.88 - 1450.24] someday for a heart attack or a stroke
[1449.28 - 1453.04] because their blood
[1450.24 - 1454.32] is filled up with so much fat so i'm
[1453.04 - 1458.08] just trying to make a fat feel
[1454.32 - 1461.52] a fat free meal for you guys
[1458.08 - 1464.00] it's fun all right so
[1461.52 - 1464.72] what i got in here so far i got pea
[1464.00 - 1467.20] shoots
[1464.72 - 1468.32] right i got spinach in here all the
[1467.20 - 1469.52] leafy greens and i got
[1468.32 - 1472.72] well these are sprouts which is
[1469.52 - 1473.52] incredible um and i got parsley in here
[1472.72 - 1475.12] so
[1473.52 - 1477.44] just mixing it up a little bit so what
[1475.12 - 1477.44] i'm doing
[1480.40 - 1484.80] hey you know the number one food group
[1482.08 - 1484.80] out there in the world
[1485.04 - 1491.84] it's eggs and caffeine
[1489.84 - 1493.52] it's a number one food even more than
[1491.84 - 1496.72] bread
[1493.52 - 1497.92] eggs and caffeine even more than gluten
[1496.72 - 1499.36] we're going to talk about gluten if you
[1497.92 - 1500.00] guys just came on here i'm steaming up
[1499.36 - 1502.32] cauliflower
[1500.00 - 1503.36] asparagus i'm making a potato salad and
[1502.32 - 1504.72] we're going to be talking about
[1503.36 - 1507.12] apple cider vinegar we're going to talk
[1504.72 - 1509.20] about caffeine we're going to talk about
[1507.12 - 1514.00] um talk about gluten we're going to talk
[1509.20 - 1516.24] about eggs
[1514.00 - 1517.60] so i think i'm coming along pretty good
[1516.24 - 1520.24] right there these are
[1517.60 - 1522.16] these are car cars these are red oranges
[1520.24 - 1524.48] they should be red inside
[1522.16 - 1524.48] okay
[1525.84 - 1531.52] here's a food that nobody eats
[1529.12 - 1533.12] like they should right they'll do 10 000
[1531.52 - 1536.24] chocolate bars
[1533.12 - 1539.68] in 15 years 10 000 chocolate bars
[1536.24 - 1542.24] but they won't do 10 000 of these
[1539.68 - 1543.12] you know the whole world is set is set
[1542.24 - 1546.16] up so you guys
[1543.12 - 1548.00] age as fast as possible it's all about
[1546.16 - 1550.08] aging
[1548.00 - 1552.80] they age you the caffeine ages you
[1550.08 - 1552.80] really fast
[1553.04 - 1556.88] all the all kinds of different
[1555.12 - 1559.44] techniques people are using to try to
[1556.88 - 1562.72] heal can age them fast
[1559.44 - 1562.72] cutting an onion right now you guys
[1563.60 - 1567.92] i mean caffeine will age you quick high
[1566.16 - 1571.44] fat diets will age you
[1567.92 - 1574.72] fast you'll age really quick
[1571.44 - 1576.72] with a high fat diet vinegar
[1574.72 - 1578.48] will age you quick apple cider vinegar
[1576.72 - 1580.56] you want to age quick you want wrinkles
[1578.48 - 1582.00] by 32
[1580.56 - 1583.68] just make sure you do apple cider
[1582.00 - 1584.00] vinegar every single day it'll actually
[1583.68 - 1585.76] help
[1584.00 - 1587.36] you get there for wrinkles at 32
[1585.76 - 1588.72] wrinkles at 28.
[1587.36 - 1590.00] you'll have to go and you'll next thing
[1588.72 - 1590.88] you know you're all worried and you have
[1590.00 - 1592.40] to
[1590.88 - 1594.40] you'll be thinking about botox or
[1592.40 - 1596.00] something
[1594.40 - 1599.84] i think this is steaming along really
[1596.00 - 1599.84] good the salad's coming along good
[1602.80 - 1608.72] poison ivy said oxygen i need to verify
[1605.20 - 1608.72] with that science it's interesting
[1611.12 - 1617.12] well can you verify this
[1614.48 - 1618.00] 250 million people in america alone with
[1617.12 - 1620.48] symptoms
[1618.00 - 1622.48] and conditions with no answers can you
[1620.48 - 1624.00] verify that one
[1622.48 - 1626.40] because i want to know how to verify
[1624.00 - 1628.80] that let's verify that one
[1626.40 - 1630.48] okay how about this one let's verify
[1628.80 - 1634.40] this one
[1630.48 - 1636.16] science said that eggs years ago
[1634.40 - 1638.96] will give you a heart attack eventually
[1636.16 - 1642.48] fill your heart up with cholesterol
[1638.96 - 1644.40] now science says eggs are good for you
[1642.48 - 1646.72] so what do you want to verify because
[1644.40 - 1649.44] science stomps on itself constantly it
[1646.72 - 1651.92] changes every year
[1649.44 - 1654.32] so i'm confused are you trying to verify
[1651.92 - 1656.56] something so that
[1654.32 - 1657.68] it can be changed in one year from
[1656.56 - 1659.36] another study
[1657.68 - 1661.92] or change in six months because no
[1659.36 - 1662.72] studies they all they're all stomped on
[1661.92 - 1665.04] each other
[1662.72 - 1666.24] they're com they're all run over by the
[1665.04 - 1668.16] next science study
[1666.24 - 1669.76] every six months by the next one every
[1668.16 - 1670.40] year there's not one science study you
[1669.76 - 1672.64] could actually
[1670.40 - 1674.40] hold or talk about that hasn't been
[1672.64 - 1677.60] stomped on
[1674.40 - 1677.60] just shortly after
[1678.16 - 1682.24] so what's happening is there's a whole
[1680.48 - 1685.76] bunch of studies out there that that
[1682.24 - 1687.28] are null and void you know do you ever
[1685.76 - 1689.04] avoid a check
[1687.28 - 1690.48] do you ever write a check and you wrote
[1689.04 - 1691.68] it wrong and you were trying to write a
[1690.48 - 1693.04] check and you wrote a wrote
[1691.68 - 1695.20] wrong in your checkbook and then you
[1693.04 - 1697.28] wrote void across it
[1695.20 - 1698.88] well that's what science is it's a big
[1697.28 - 1700.96] void
[1698.88 - 1702.88] every single study has void written
[1700.96 - 1705.20] across it a year later
[1702.88 - 1707.04] every last one of them every food study
[1705.20 - 1711.84] has void written over it
[1707.04 - 1711.84] every single study
[1712.00 - 1714.96] i want to know i want to know when are
[1713.60 - 1716.32] they going to come up with that study of
[1714.96 - 1718.08] why everybody's sick in the united
[1716.32 - 1719.44] states and globally why everybody's sick
[1718.08 - 1721.52] with the symptom and condition and
[1719.44 - 1723.20] there's no answers
[1721.52 - 1725.44] do you think everybody wants to be sick
[1723.20 - 1728.72] because it do you think
[1725.44 - 1729.76] the 250 million americans that are
[1728.72 - 1732.08] really sick
[1729.76 - 1733.52] right in this country do you think they
[1732.08 - 1735.44] want to be sick
[1733.52 - 1737.36] and they just don't want to embark on
[1735.44 - 1738.64] what science has to offer to get them
[1737.36 - 1740.72] healed and better
[1738.64 - 1742.40] is that what it is do you think 250
[1740.72 - 1743.28] million americans never went to go see
[1742.40 - 1745.44] their doctor
[1743.28 - 1746.64] because they don't want science to help
[1745.44 - 1749.04] them no
[1746.64 - 1750.64] they do they want science to help them
[1749.04 - 1752.48] they're desperate everybody is
[1750.64 - 1755.52] and science doesn't help them everybody
[1752.48 - 1758.08] stays sick so
[1755.52 - 1760.00] the six billion people on this planet
[1758.08 - 1761.84] that have symptoms actually probably six
[1760.00 - 1762.72] and a half billion people's honest on
[1761.84 - 1764.80] the planet
[1762.72 - 1766.24] that have symptoms and conditions do you
[1764.80 - 1768.24] think they
[1766.24 - 1770.00] don't want science to help them do you
[1768.24 - 1771.68] think they just want to stay sick
[1770.00 - 1773.84] six and a half billion people just want
[1771.68 - 1777.36] to stay sick
[1773.84 - 1777.36] i want to know where that study is
[1778.24 - 1782.16] and here's the other thing no matter how
[1780.64 - 1784.16] or what you say
[1782.16 - 1785.28] science only has one answer a couple
[1784.16 - 1787.36] little answers
[1785.28 - 1789.20] it's it's your genes and that's why
[1787.36 - 1790.00] you're sick it's your body attacking
[1789.20 - 1792.56] itself
[1790.00 - 1794.24] autoimmune your body's destroying itself
[1792.56 - 1796.16] that that's an answer
[1794.24 - 1798.24] the other answer is maybe hormones if
[1796.16 - 1800.56] you're lucky that's an answer
[1798.24 - 1800.56] um
[1801.44 - 1804.64] and here's the new one from alternative
[1803.44 - 1806.48] science by the way
[1804.64 - 1808.48] here's a great one from alternative
[1806.48 - 1810.88] science you're creating it with your
[1808.48 - 1810.88] thoughts
[1811.20 - 1814.64] you're sick because you're making
[1813.52 - 1817.28] yourself sick
[1814.64 - 1818.96] because you're you want yourself sick
[1817.28 - 1819.52] that's the alternative medicine new
[1818.96 - 1821.68] thought
[1819.52 - 1823.04] that's their new science they believe
[1821.68 - 1824.72] that you want to be sick
[1823.04 - 1826.08] that you're making yourself sick with
[1824.72 - 1827.44] your thoughts you're not good enough
[1826.08 - 1828.00] you're not thinking good enough you're
[1827.44 - 1829.52] not
[1828.00 - 1831.36] you're not doing you're not mastering
[1829.52 - 1832.56] your mind that's why you're sick so what
[1831.36 - 1833.84] science are you talking about you talk
[1832.56 - 1834.96] about alternative science because they
[1833.84 - 1836.00] just believe you're sick because you're
[1834.96 - 1838.16] not mastering your mind
[1836.00 - 1841.12] now or is it conventional science which
[1838.16 - 1842.96] just believes it's your genes
[1841.12 - 1844.83] but no i but i love i love the question
[1842.96 - 1846.00] i love the science stuff
[1844.83 - 1847.76] [Music]
[1846.00 - 1849.36] meanwhile it's not everything else it's
[1847.76 - 1851.12] not the toxic heavy metals the mercury
[1849.36 - 1853.20] aluminum cadmium lead
[1851.12 - 1854.80] nickel that's in your brain it's not the
[1853.20 - 1856.08] radiation falling out of the sky it's
[1854.80 - 1857.76] not the radiation
[1856.08 - 1859.84] on your plane flight that's more than an
[1857.76 - 1861.04] hour it's not the radiation when you go
[1859.84 - 1863.44] through the airport and you get
[1861.04 - 1865.36] completely contaminated with radiation
[1863.44 - 1867.60] your luggage is glowing
[1865.36 - 1868.96] your luggage luggage is glowing and then
[1867.60 - 1870.40] you're poisoning your children because
[1868.96 - 1872.00] your luggage is sitting next to your
[1870.40 - 1874.48] children after it's gone through the
[1872.00 - 1874.48] machine
[1876.24 - 1880.72] it's not that it's not the viruses and
[1878.72 - 1882.24] bacteria that are eating people up alive
[1880.72 - 1883.20] out there it's why they can't function
[1882.24 - 1885.12] and they're sick
[1883.20 - 1886.80] it's not the metals feeding the viruses
[1885.12 - 1888.16] so people can't function either it's not
[1886.80 - 1890.56] any of that no
[1888.16 - 1892.24] science is so smart it's your genes
[1890.56 - 1895.12] science is so smart it's your body
[1892.24 - 1895.12] attacking itself
[1895.20 - 1898.08] it's not all the caffeine you're doing
[1896.56 - 1900.16] because it's the number one food group
[1898.08 - 1901.68] next to eggs
[1900.16 - 1903.28] so it's not all the caffeine and eggs
[1901.68 - 1904.88] you're doing that's your food group
[1903.28 - 1906.72] that's everybody's number one food group
[1904.88 - 1908.32] it's eggs and caffeine it's not that
[1906.72 - 1912.08] that's not why you're sick
[1908.32 - 1912.08] i better find some science fast
[1912.96 - 1916.72] science is gonna save us science is
[1914.88 - 1918.64] gonna save us oh my god they're gonna
[1916.72 - 1920.32] save us i'm a dog waiting for a bone
[1918.64 - 1921.76] science is going to save us is it
[1920.32 - 1923.28] another study coming around the corner
[1921.76 - 1926.08] because i've been sick for 20 years with
[1923.28 - 1926.08] hashimoto's
[1928.12 - 1935.84] [Music]
[1929.36 - 1935.84] anyway all right we're making a salad
[1936.32 - 1940.48] you know it's incredible how everybody
[1938.08 - 1943.76] is waiting for science to save them
[1940.48 - 1944.48] with chronic illness ask anybody with
[1943.76 - 1947.84] raging
[1944.48 - 1949.84] eczema psoriasis did science save them
[1947.84 - 1951.44] what about vitiligo did science save
[1949.84 - 1954.56] them
[1951.44 - 1957.36] what about multiple sclerosis about
[1954.56 - 1957.36] parkinson's
[1958.80 - 1962.40] i mean we got great surgeons and your
[1960.80 - 1963.20] gallbladder explodes you need a good
[1962.40 - 1965.68] surgeon
[1963.20 - 1967.52] absolutely but i'm talking about chronic
[1965.68 - 1968.88] illness with everybody walking around
[1967.52 - 1970.64] like wounded soldiers
[1968.88 - 1972.32] can't find answers they're just
[1970.64 - 1975.04] suffering fatigue
[1972.32 - 1976.00] depression anxiety they can't function
[1975.04 - 1978.16] they don't feel good
[1976.00 - 1981.44] body aches and pains dizziness skin
[1978.16 - 1981.44] problems skin disorders
[1982.48 - 1986.88] anyway here's what happened with eggs so
[1985.12 - 1991.44] let's talk about eggs for a little bit
[1986.88 - 1995.52] i think it's time so eggs were used
[1991.44 - 1998.64] in labs many years ago to feed viruses
[1995.52 - 2002.88] so that's what happened so eggs
[1998.64 - 2005.84] were used against us they took the egg
[2002.88 - 2007.36] right actually a survival food i have
[2005.84 - 2009.36] nothing against eggs
[2007.36 - 2011.28] i thought it was a good survival food
[2009.36 - 2013.68] you know for like for centuries
[2011.28 - 2015.20] because people could survive on it but
[2013.68 - 2018.64] in the 1920s
[2015.20 - 2021.20] 1930s right around the 1920s actually a
[2018.64 - 2024.56] little before that they took the egg
[2021.20 - 2027.76] and they decided to use it
[2024.56 - 2031.28] to raise bugs in the labs so
[2027.76 - 2035.28] your herpes simplex 1
[2031.28 - 2038.88] was raised in the lab your cold sore
[2035.28 - 2040.96] is patented it's raised in a lab
[2038.88 - 2042.64] it might be a mutated version now you
[2040.96 - 2045.68] might not be patting it anymore
[2042.64 - 2047.76] the original ones were patented
[2045.68 - 2050.16] so your herpes simplex one your herpes
[2047.76 - 2051.92] simplex 2 your epstein var your sediment
[2050.16 - 2054.08] virus your shingles whatever it is
[2051.92 - 2055.68] that's causing all your conditions they
[2054.08 - 2058.88] were raised in labs
[2055.68 - 2061.28] on eggs so they took an egg
[2058.88 - 2063.04] and they fed that it's they actually
[2061.28 - 2063.92] they cracked open the top they open the
[2063.04 - 2065.92] top they put
[2063.92 - 2067.76] they put the viruses in the viruses and
[2065.92 - 2069.28] the bacteria the streptococcus
[2067.76 - 2070.96] they learn how to grow them they learn
[2069.28 - 2072.56] how to keep them
[2070.96 - 2074.16] and now epstein-barr has over 60
[2072.56 - 2075.84] varieties of mutations
[2074.16 - 2077.44] shingles has over 30 varieties of
[2075.84 - 2079.28] mutations as the years went on
[2077.44 - 2081.84] everybody passing them around you know
[2079.28 - 2082.88] around generations of passing them down
[2081.84 - 2086.56] through utero
[2082.88 - 2086.56] generations and passing them down
[2086.80 - 2090.16] from from spreading them generations of
[2089.76 - 2092.16] of
[2090.16 - 2094.08] you know drinking off somebody else's
[2092.16 - 2097.04] bottle drinking off somebody else's
[2094.08 - 2099.84] glass oops now i got epstein barr
[2097.04 - 2101.28] going into a public bathroom having the
[2099.84 - 2104.08] water underneath splash
[2101.28 - 2105.52] up splashed up your butt and now you got
[2104.08 - 2107.36] streptococcus
[2105.52 - 2109.52] now you've got strep throat a month
[2107.36 - 2111.28] later and you're at the doctor's office
[2109.52 - 2113.12] nobody knows why you have strep throat
[2111.28 - 2115.52] everything was going okay
[2113.12 - 2116.56] now you got a uti now you got chronic
[2115.52 - 2118.32] sinusitis
[2116.56 - 2119.52] now you got bladder infections now you
[2118.32 - 2120.80] got yeast infections which is
[2119.52 - 2124.40] streptococcus
[2120.80 - 2127.60] um so the eggs raised
[2124.40 - 2128.32] the bugs that were released out into the
[2127.60 - 2131.52] world
[2128.32 - 2132.24] that we have within us so the simplex
[2131.52 - 2134.80] one
[2132.24 - 2136.16] that was created from the egg so you
[2134.80 - 2138.80] love eggs so much
[2136.16 - 2145.12] but the eggs just feed that bug and then
[2138.80 - 2146.88] causes more trouble as time goes on
[2145.12 - 2150.00] all right so the this is good these are
[2146.88 - 2153.12] steamed down good
[2150.00 - 2153.12] i'm gonna shut this off
[2154.24 - 2158.40] hey i just saw something this guy is
[2156.84 - 2161.52] fear-mongering
[2158.40 - 2163.84] it's pretty funny you say that
[2161.52 - 2166.96] were all those women that had anxiety
[2163.84 - 2170.24] back in the 50s 60s 70s and 80s
[2166.96 - 2173.20] and they were they were knocked out
[2170.24 - 2174.88] thrown on a table probes stuck up their
[2173.20 - 2176.56] sinuses up their nose the front of their
[2174.88 - 2178.00] brain taking off of them taking off of
[2176.56 - 2179.44] them was called the lobotomy because you
[2178.00 - 2182.72] had anxiety
[2179.44 - 2184.40] hundreds of thousands of women had the
[2182.72 - 2187.84] front of their brain removed
[2184.40 - 2187.84] because they had anxiety
[2189.12 - 2193.60] you just don't like truth that's all if
[2192.16 - 2196.80] you don't like truth
[2193.60 - 2198.96] i get it so you know what stay on your
[2196.80 - 2201.04] caffeine
[2198.96 - 2202.88] you know believe that the world is
[2201.04 - 2205.36] perfect
[2202.88 - 2206.64] if you want don't worry about all the
[2205.36 - 2208.00] people who are suffering sick with
[2206.64 - 2208.80] chronic illness who can't live their
[2208.00 - 2211.92] lives
[2208.80 - 2211.92] and they have no answers
[2212.88 - 2219.44] but you know what lorraine l says it's
[2216.16 - 2221.36] truth mongering more like it
[2219.44 - 2224.32] it's about getting people better so you
[2221.36 - 2227.04] actually have information
[2224.32 - 2229.28] look if you got chronic etis chronic
[2227.04 - 2231.20] bladder infections if you've got cfs
[2229.28 - 2233.60] you've got fibromyalgia if you've got
[2231.20 - 2235.20] lupus if you've got any kind of disorder
[2233.60 - 2236.96] and you're eating eggs wouldn't you want
[2235.20 - 2238.32] to know that if you stopped eating the
[2236.96 - 2240.72] eggs you're one
[2238.32 - 2242.48] more step closer to healing and getting
[2240.72 - 2244.40] better or should i be worried about fear
[2242.48 - 2246.00] mongering and be like no then just eat
[2244.40 - 2247.60] your eggs don't don't come out with the
[2246.00 - 2249.92] truth don't help people don't talk to
[2247.60 - 2249.92] people
[2250.88 - 2254.40] all right so let's keep on making this
[2252.72 - 2255.92] so i'm going to chop up some onion i'm
[2254.40 - 2258.08] going to do thinly sliced onion i'm
[2255.92 - 2260.24] making a potato salad
[2258.08 - 2262.86] but it's with leafy greens this potato
[2260.24 - 2269.04] salad isn't with mayo
[2262.86 - 2272.72] [Music]
[2269.04 - 2272.72] just cutting up some onion nice and thin
[2276.92 - 2282.55] [Music]
[2282.84 - 2285.92] so
[2284.08 - 2288.16] i'm not going to cut these pieces up
[2285.92 - 2289.44] real small so i don't want to do that so
[2288.16 - 2291.92] i'm going to put a few on here i'm going
[2289.44 - 2293.92] to put a few on later too
[2291.92 - 2296.84] i want i want the onion pieces kind of a
[2293.92 - 2298.08] little bigger even though they're sliced
[2296.84 - 2299.84] then
[2298.08 - 2301.36] you know everybody's on blood thinners
[2299.84 - 2302.96] because the high fat diets by the way
[2301.36 - 2304.56] their adrenals get burnt out it can't
[2302.96 - 2313.60] thin out their blood anymore
[2304.56 - 2314.56] cardiovascular problems
[2313.60 - 2317.12] i think i'm going to cut up some
[2314.56 - 2317.12] potatoes
[2320.00 - 2324.32] these are these are gold potatoes look
[2322.00 - 2326.48] at those
[2324.32 - 2328.40] cheryl says is that is that why they ask
[2326.48 - 2330.40] if you're allergic to eggs
[2328.40 - 2333.28] before they give you a flu shot and
[2330.40 - 2333.28] never understood that
[2335.04 - 2338.72] eggs are in all pharmaceuticals just
[2337.44 - 2341.68] just a 4-1-1
[2338.72 - 2342.08] on that just a wake-up call eggs are in
[2341.68 - 2344.88] all
[2342.08 - 2344.88] pharmaceuticals
[2345.76 - 2352.00] chopping up some potato here
[2348.88 - 2355.04] eyes are watering from the onion
[2352.00 - 2357.44] that red onion was strong wow that one
[2355.04 - 2357.44] got me
[2360.16 - 2369.44] eggs are in all pharmaceuticals
[2365.12 - 2371.36] the silver toxic heavy metals
[2369.44 - 2372.80] eggs will feed every single bug every
[2371.36 - 2375.44] single pathogen you're worried about
[2372.80 - 2375.44] candida
[2376.08 - 2379.28] you're worried about sibo
[2379.68 - 2383.12] you're worried about what are you
[2381.20 - 2384.48] worried about nothing you don't think
[2383.12 - 2385.20] bugs do anything you don't think you
[2384.48 - 2386.48] have any bugs
[2385.20 - 2388.80] you just think your body's attacking
[2386.48 - 2390.24] itself for its jeans
[2388.80 - 2397.84] well i mean i just got to give you the
[2390.24 - 2397.84] 4-1-1 on that one too it's bugs
[2400.24 - 2403.44] so i'm cutting up a few potatoes
[2401.76 - 2405.60] throwing it on top gonna put the steamed
[2403.44 - 2408.84] veggies in
[2405.60 - 2411.84] so egg is a good source of protein and
[2408.84 - 2411.84] fat
[2413.60 - 2417.52] let me tell you something about what
[2414.88 - 2421.04] eggs do when you have endometriosis
[2417.52 - 2421.04] pcos and fibroids
[2422.40 - 2429.36] eggs grow fibroids
[2426.32 - 2434.08] worsen pcos worsen endometriosis
[2429.36 - 2434.08] that's what eggs do so
[2435.92 - 2441.04] eggs are
[2439.20 - 2442.96] an instigator of those conditions if you
[2441.04 - 2445.12] have a reproductive system condition or
[2442.96 - 2448.08] disease or anything like that
[2445.12 - 2448.40] eggs will worsen it the worst thing you
[2448.08 - 2452.64] can
[2448.40 - 2456.24] ever do is eat eggs with pcos
[2452.64 - 2456.24] the worst thing you could ever do
[2459.04 - 2462.80] but yet you know no one no one knows why
[2461.68 - 2464.08] you get pcos
[2462.80 - 2466.08] they don't know what causes it they
[2464.08 - 2467.28] think it's genes no one knows why you're
[2466.08 - 2468.40] sick with any conditions or
[2467.28 - 2470.08] endometriosis or any kind of
[2468.40 - 2470.56] reproductive system condition nobody
[2470.08 - 2472.00] knows
[2470.56 - 2473.92] but they'll tell you what to eat and
[2472.00 - 2477.84] that's how you eat lots of eggs
[2473.92 - 2477.84] no science behind it whatsoever
[2478.80 - 2483.52] got a tomato right here everyone's on
[2481.20 - 2487.04] eggs
[2483.52 - 2488.96] everyone is on eggs even vegans are on
[2487.04 - 2492.16] eggs
[2488.96 - 2494.00] right that's why vegans don't rip apart
[2492.16 - 2497.28] eggs you know why
[2494.00 - 2499.04] because they go back to them later on
[2497.28 - 2500.32] the minute they get sick or something
[2499.04 - 2502.48] goes wrong or they're like
[2500.32 - 2504.08] wait a minute i'm getting sick and i'm a
[2502.48 - 2507.20] vegan
[2504.08 - 2508.00] they run back to eggs they start to
[2507.20 - 2509.60] doubt themselves
[2508.00 - 2510.96] they start to doubt why they're vegan if
[2509.60 - 2512.56] you're vegan stay vegan if your
[2510.96 - 2514.00] plant-based stay plant-based
[2512.56 - 2516.00] if you're animal protein stay animal
[2514.00 - 2518.64] protein if you want but just
[2516.00 - 2520.40] stay off of eggs throw in some tomatoes
[2518.64 - 2525.12] on here
[2520.40 - 2526.88] everyone's sick everyone's getting sick
[2525.12 - 2528.96] don't get fooled when you see young
[2526.88 - 2532.40] people that
[2528.96 - 2534.08] that escaped sickness early on
[2532.40 - 2536.08] don't really have anything going on but
[2534.08 - 2537.60] they get a cold they get a uti once in a
[2536.08 - 2540.64] while they get some acne
[2537.60 - 2542.16] don't get tricked because they're just
[2540.64 - 2544.08] going to get sick when they're 40 years
[2542.16 - 2546.48] old just like everybody else is now or
[2544.08 - 2549.44] 38 or 35
[2546.48 - 2551.28] they're just gonna get sick and
[2549.44 - 2553.44] everybody's eating eggs but it's not
[2551.28 - 2554.96] questioned it's never questioned isn't
[2553.44 - 2556.40] that funny everybody's on caffeine
[2554.96 - 2557.04] everybody's eating eggs that's the two
[2556.40 - 2559.44] food groups
[2557.04 - 2561.44] two number one food groups caffeine and
[2559.44 - 2563.68] eggs but it's never questioned
[2561.44 - 2564.96] meanwhile everybody's getting sick but
[2563.68 - 2567.76] those aren't questioned ever
[2564.96 - 2569.44] they're not even looked at as an issue
[2567.76 - 2571.04] but yet it's the number one
[2569.44 - 2572.48] food group and if we're always going to
[2571.04 - 2574.88] walk around saying
[2572.48 - 2576.88] food makes us sick food is thy medicine
[2574.88 - 2577.44] food is what keeps us going food's what
[2576.88 - 2580.56] protects
[2577.44 - 2583.36] us food is what you eat is what you are
[2580.56 - 2585.12] whatever you want to do realize then if
[2583.36 - 2586.96] this is the number one food group which
[2585.12 - 2587.92] is eggs and caffeine and we're all sick
[2586.96 - 2590.72] on the planet
[2587.92 - 2593.84] huh no one's looking at the number one
[2590.72 - 2593.84] food everybody's eating
[2595.12 - 2598.32] these tomatoes look really good
[2602.32 - 2606.24] i'm gonna cut up some more tomatoes put
[2604.88 - 2608.40] some more onions on top and i'm going to
[2606.24 - 2611.84] put some
[2608.40 - 2613.68] putting some onion on here so listen to
[2611.84 - 2614.96] medical medium podcasts at apple podcast
[2613.68 - 2616.16] have you guys been listening to my
[2614.96 - 2619.28] podcast
[2616.16 - 2621.20] medical medium podcast at apple podcast
[2619.28 - 2622.80] i have an egg episode with a lot of a
[2621.20 - 2624.56] lot of questions you know answered on
[2622.80 - 2626.48] that
[2624.56 - 2629.52] i'm going to put some of these in here
[2626.48 - 2632.24] some of these steamed vegetables
[2629.52 - 2634.00] i steamed them up in the pan got some
[2632.24 - 2637.28] asparagus
[2634.00 - 2637.28] cauliflower right here you guys
[2643.44 - 2650.00] science is so smart right
[2646.84 - 2652.40] that they want you to be on lots of meat
[2650.00 - 2654.16] if you're anemic right
[2652.40 - 2655.84] that's kind of always perplexed me it's
[2654.16 - 2657.52] a head scratcher for me
[2655.84 - 2659.20] because everybody who's anemic they're
[2657.52 - 2661.84] on meat
[2659.20 - 2664.00] so you i can't tell you how many times
[2661.84 - 2665.52] i've talked to people who are anemic
[2664.00 - 2667.20] and they said the doctor wants me to be
[2665.52 - 2668.56] on meat i said well what's your diet and
[2667.20 - 2671.04] they said well i eat meat
[2668.56 - 2671.84] i go you you've always eat you've always
[2671.04 - 2674.64] eaten meat
[2671.84 - 2676.00] like yeah i've always eaten meat then
[2674.64 - 2677.20] how does that work your doctor tells you
[2676.00 - 2678.32] to eat meat because you're anemic but
[2677.20 - 2680.80] you've already been eating meat your
[2678.32 - 2680.80] whole life
[2681.84 - 2687.28] do you guys see the irony in any of that
[2687.68 - 2694.16] cause of anemia is toxic heavy metals
[2690.72 - 2696.16] plus viruses low-grade viral infections
[2694.16 - 2699.36] such as epstein-barr
[2696.16 - 2702.08] that's the anemia virus
[2699.36 - 2704.08] and they feed on iron there's certain
[2702.08 - 2706.32] varieties of epstein-barr
[2704.08 - 2707.84] certain mutations that love to feed on
[2706.32 - 2711.04] iron and that's where we get the
[2707.84 - 2711.04] the mystery anemia
[2712.00 - 2718.72] aretha says i thought tomatoes
[2715.68 - 2722.08] are inflammatory
[2718.72 - 2723.68] they're not inflammatory that's a that's
[2722.08 - 2727.36] a myth
[2723.68 - 2729.52] absolutely but pizza the tomatoes are
[2727.36 - 2732.16] really inflammatory on pizza because
[2729.52 - 2732.88] your pizza is going to have cheese it's
[2732.16 - 2735.28] going to have
[2732.88 - 2737.28] which is really highly inflammatory it's
[2735.28 - 2739.28] going to have gluten in the crust
[2737.28 - 2740.80] which is highly inflammatory it's going
[2739.28 - 2744.16] to have lots of oil in there
[2740.80 - 2745.04] lots of salt salt on a high levels
[2744.16 - 2747.20] inflammatory
[2745.04 - 2748.24] meaning salt that's added in like sea
[2747.20 - 2751.68] salts and
[2748.24 - 2755.04] rock salts but or
[2751.68 - 2756.24] pasta with tomato sauce on it right
[2755.04 - 2757.92] it's not the tomatoes that's
[2756.24 - 2758.64] inflammatory it's the gluten in the
[2757.92 - 2761.08] pasta
[2758.64 - 2762.80] it's the cheese it's the parmesan cheese
[2761.08 - 2763.12] parmigiano-reggiano it's all that on
[2762.80 - 2765.92] there
[2763.12 - 2766.72] gianno it's that's what makes it a
[2765.92 - 2770.32] problem
[2766.72 - 2771.28] tomatoes are anti-viral tomatoes are
[2770.32 - 2775.12] healing
[2771.28 - 2776.64] there's vitamin c in tomatoes so
[2775.12 - 2779.92] these are actually this is actually a

[2925.69 - 2929.04] [Music]

[2929.04 - 2933.84] the book rheumatoid
[2930.56 - 2935.60] arthritis protocol in the book right
[2933.84 - 2937.76] here medical medium new edition it's in
[2935.60 - 2937.76] here
[2938.32 - 2943.60] michelle's asking what else you got
[2942.08 - 2945.60] i don't know if that's to the meals or
[2943.60 - 2947.20] something else
[2945.60 - 2949.12] putting a little extra onion on here i
[2947.20 - 2951.28] put some sage on there
[2949.12 - 2952.64] put a little bit more onion on top i'm
[2951.28 - 2954.32] going to put a little bit more tomato on
[2952.64 - 2955.12] top of the salad too so i still need
[2954.32 - 2956.88] more
[2955.12 - 2960.32] of that might garnish it with a little
[2956.88 - 2960.32] bit more parsley too
[2963.20 - 2966.24] what you'll know about these meals that
[2964.96 - 2967.92] i'm making you guys
[2966.24 - 2970.00] i'm trying to offer healing healing
[2967.92 - 2971.68] meals that aren't loaded with fat on top
[2970.00 - 2973.76] of it to get your insulin you know
[2971.68 - 2975.36] resistance off the charts because that's
[2973.76 - 2977.36] what the fats will do when you pound on
[2975.36 - 2980.48] the oils on top of this and
[2977.36 - 2982.84] get your you get insulin resistance and
[2980.48 - 2984.08] i don't want you to get insulin
[2982.84 - 2987.44] resistant
[2984.08 - 2987.44] these are fat free meals
[2987.92 - 2991.92] helps to protect your pancreas your
[2989.60 - 2991.92] liver
[2993.68 - 3001.28] your pancreas your liver your adrenals
[2999.20 - 3002.96] these are meals without vinegar meals
[3001.28 - 3005.60] without pounding the salt
[3002.96 - 3006.64] meals without pounding the oil i'm
[3005.60 - 3009.84] trying to give you
[3006.64 - 3015.20] nutritional yeast vinegar
[3009.84 - 3015.20] salt fat free meals
[3015.60 - 3019.04] so vinegar pickles are the inside of
[3018.16 - 3021.76] your organs
[3019.04 - 3022.24] dehydrates you dehydrates it sucks the
[3021.76 - 3024.80] water
[3022.24 - 3026.40] out of every cell in your body so that's
[3024.80 - 3028.56] what vinegar does
[3026.40 - 3030.08] every time you eat vinegar you're
[3028.56 - 3032.48] pickling yourself
[3030.08 - 3034.08] just like pickles in a jar and when you
[3032.48 - 3037.84] add vinegar and salt together
[3034.08 - 3039.92] you pickle yourself even more okay and
[3037.84 - 3041.60] you don't want to be a fermented food
[3039.92 - 3044.48] like you don't want to be
[3041.60 - 3044.96] a fermented food you know that's not the
[3044.48 - 3046.56] goal
[3044.96 - 3048.48] that's not what your body wants it
[3046.56 - 3050.80] doesn't want you to ferment it it
[3048.48 - 3051.44] doesn't want you to suck the life out of
[3050.80 - 3053.92] it
[3051.44 - 3055.60] your body is always subjected to all of
[3053.92 - 3057.84] our idiotic ideas
[3055.60 - 3059.68] here on earth that's what it's subjected
[3057.84 - 3061.76] to it's subjected to
[3059.68 - 3062.88] caffeine it's subjected to eggs it's
[3061.76 - 3064.56] subjected to
[3062.88 - 3066.00] because now eggs are are not good
[3064.56 - 3066.40] anymore because what i told you guys
[3066.00 - 3067.76] about
[3066.40 - 3069.68] what they did to them they ruined them
[3067.76 - 3071.44] on you it subjected like
[3069.68 - 3073.28] to the nutritional yeast subject it to
[3071.44 - 3074.08] the vinegars like i said subjected to
[3073.28 - 3077.20] all the salt
[3074.08 - 3079.12] subjected to all the oils
[3077.20 - 3081.36] fermented foods was a survival food
[3079.12 - 3083.92] because in the country
[3081.36 - 3085.04] you took your garden vegetables
[3083.92 - 3087.20] everything you had
[3085.04 - 3089.20] left and you took them and you stuck
[3087.20 - 3092.32] them in a big container
[3089.20 - 3095.36] and you fermented them so
[3092.32 - 3097.04] that you can stay alive when winter came
[3095.36 - 3098.40] because you had no electricity you
[3097.04 - 3099.28] couldn't you couldn't have you didn't
[3098.40 - 3101.28] have a freezer
[3099.28 - 3103.04] to freeze your food you didn't have a
[3101.28 - 3103.76] refrigerator to keep your food you know
[3103.04 - 3105.76] fresh
[3103.76 - 3107.92] plus you didn't have options to get more
[3105.76 - 3110.80] food coming in more food coming in
[3107.92 - 3111.52] it was a survival tactic around the
[3110.80 - 3115.68] world
[3111.52 - 3118.80] okay because when winter was approaching
[3115.68 - 3120.00] your garden was picked it was done you
[3118.80 - 3122.40] get one last term
[3120.00 - 3124.48] you know turn up you get a few more
[3122.40 - 3125.52] greens or onions or whatever you get out
[3124.48 - 3127.44] of your garden
[3125.52 - 3129.28] and then it's done for the year you take
[3127.44 - 3130.80] everything you had cabbages whatever it
[3129.28 - 3133.84] is and you shove it into that
[3130.80 - 3136.96] and you ferment it to make it last
[3133.84 - 3138.64] longer for survival it was just a
[3136.96 - 3140.64] survival tactic
[3138.64 - 3142.72] it didn't mean it was the answer see the
[3140.64 - 3143.28] world has changed you have fresh produce
[3142.72 - 3145.68] now
[3143.28 - 3147.44] you don't have to go back to that you
[3145.68 - 3148.08] got fresh produce you could take care of
[3147.44 - 3150.08] yourself
[3148.08 - 3151.68] you got fresh priest you know pea
[3150.08 - 3155.04] sprouts fresh
[3151.68 - 3158.32] parsley spinach
[3155.04 - 3161.04] you don't want dead decaying food
[3158.32 - 3162.80] and that's what happens fermented foods
[3161.04 - 3164.48] not like when you cook something down or
[3162.80 - 3166.32] steam it or you have all these raw
[3164.48 - 3170.24] vegetables fermented food
[3166.32 - 3173.52] is dead it died it lost its
[3170.24 - 3177.04] life and the bacteria on
[3173.52 - 3180.80] fermented food is death borne
[3177.04 - 3184.16] bacteria that's what that is it's not
[3180.80 - 3185.68] living bacteria when you pluck parsley
[3184.16 - 3187.76] out of your garden
[3185.68 - 3188.88] it's got microorganisms on it that's
[3187.76 - 3192.56] alive
[3188.88 - 3195.68] that's living because the plant's living
[3192.56 - 3198.72] when you take this and you ferment it
[3195.68 - 3201.68] and it dies now the bacteria
[3198.72 - 3203.44] is for death it's like when an animal
[3201.68 - 3206.64] dies in the woods
[3203.44 - 3211.36] it gets overcome by bacteria
[3206.64 - 3214.72] that's death feeding bacteria
[3211.36 - 3216.16] that's why you know when we die we get
[3214.72 - 3219.52] overcome
[3216.16 - 3224.08] by bacteria really fast that's why they
[3219.52 - 3226.88] embalm us to stop us from breaking down
[3224.08 - 3228.96] when vegetables and plant life die it
[3226.88 - 3230.64] gets engulfed by bacteria
[3228.96 - 3233.84] but we're not supposed to be eating
[3230.64 - 3235.60] death ridden bacteria
[3233.84 - 3238.00] we're supposed to be eating
[3235.60 - 3239.44] microorganisms that are on your spinach
[3238.00 - 3241.68] leaves in the garden
[3239.44 - 3243.28] that are on this orange on the surface
[3241.68 - 3244.24] if you grate a little bit of the orange
[3243.28 - 3247.36] peel
[3244.24 - 3248.40] um you know on the sage in your garden
[3247.36 - 3251.44] right here
[3248.40 - 3253.68] fresh fresh picked asparagus
[3251.44 - 3256.32] that's the bacteria that we're supposed
[3253.68 - 3256.32] to consume
[3257.92 - 3260.96] rose says well i guess you are the
[3259.92 - 3263.12] authority then
[3260.96 - 3264.08] peace out glad eating more vegetables
[3263.12 - 3266.80] and removing animal
[3264.08 - 3267.60] fats helps people nothing new here
[3266.80 - 3269.52] that's
[3267.60 - 3270.72] a head scratcher for me rose to be
[3269.52 - 3274.16] honest with you
[3270.72 - 3275.76] because uh the whole high fat
[3274.16 - 3277.20] movement going on that's been going on
[3275.76 - 3280.72] forever well
[3277.20 - 3284.16] medical medium information 35 years ago
[3280.72 - 3285.04] put the pin in that bubble about fat
[3284.16 - 3287.76] being bad
[3285.04 - 3290.16] so that's 35 plus years of work for
[3287.76 - 3293.76] medical medium to teach people low fat
[3290.16 - 3296.00] so interesting because guess what
[3293.76 - 3298.00] it was a small health movement back then
[3296.00 - 3298.64] and i talked to everybody i lectured
[3298.00 - 3301.36] about it
[3298.64 - 3301.92] i wrote about it you name it and the
[3301.36 - 3304.40] circuit
[3301.92 - 3306.32] back then 35 years ago knows who i was
[3304.40 - 3310.00] and knows who i am till this day
[3306.32 - 3311.04] and knows why avoid fats is out there to
[3310.00 - 3312.64] the extent it is
[3311.04 - 3314.56] even though it's not really out there
[3312.64 - 3316.64] because everybody's pounding the fats 24
[3314.56 - 3317.36] 7 and the keto diet is basically out
[3316.64 - 3319.52] there
[3317.36 - 3321.36] you know doing that whole thing with
[3319.52 - 3323.84] fats and all that another thing too is i
[3321.36 - 3326.64] don't say get off of animal protein
[3323.84 - 3328.32] that's another thing too so it's like
[3326.64 - 3329.92] removing animal fats well
[3328.32 - 3331.92] first of all if you want to eat chicken
[3329.92 - 3334.80] you can eat chicken but you can still
[3331.92 - 3336.16] heal if you want to eat animal protein
[3334.80 - 3339.28] you could eat animal protein
[3336.16 - 3341.28] but you can still heal you can i've been
[3339.28 - 3343.28] talking about you got to lower it
[3341.28 - 3344.88] and know when to lower it when to eat
[3343.28 - 3347.04] your animal protein
[3344.88 - 3348.08] how to get your morning cleanse in the
[3347.04 - 3349.52] morning so you're not doing
[3348.08 - 3351.60] fats in the morning that's medical
[3349.52 - 3352.48] medium information not doing fats in the
[3351.60 - 3355.52] morning
[3352.48 - 3357.52] so all that's important too um there's
[3355.52 - 3359.04] so much detail in it it's not just as
[3357.52 - 3359.84] simple as eat some fruits and vegetables
[3359.04 - 3362.16] and you're good
[3359.84 - 3364.32] what about all the wild foods that are
[3362.16 - 3364.96] in the mm protocols what about the wild
[3364.32 - 3366.64] foods
[3364.96 - 3368.56] what about the no vinegar with no
[3366.64 - 3370.32] nutritional yeast oh that's out there
[3368.56 - 3372.32] um sorry but i'm the one who put that
[3370.32 - 3374.48] out there about no nutritional yeast
[3372.32 - 3376.80] no vinegars and all that other stuff too
[3374.48 - 3378.08] and then the true cause is a sickness so
[3376.80 - 3380.00] if you're not learning about the true
[3378.08 - 3381.52] cause over here about the fact that ebv
[3380.00 - 3383.28] causes fibromyalgia because
[3381.52 - 3384.64] that's published material for medical
[3383.28 - 3386.64] medium or
[3384.64 - 3389.36] shingles causes trigeminal algae which
[3386.64 - 3390.72] is published material for medical medium
[3389.36 - 3393.12] it's important to know all these little
[3390.72 - 3394.00] details i love when someone tries to
[3393.12 - 3396.88] round it off
[3394.00 - 3398.00] and say hey you know sure nothing new
[3396.88 - 3400.32] here some fruits and
[3398.00 - 3401.44] vegetables and get rid of animal protein
[3400.32 - 3403.68] i mean
[3401.44 - 3404.96] that's all great then if that's the
[3403.68 - 3406.16] answer and it's nothing new then why is
[3404.96 - 3407.92] everybody sick
[3406.16 - 3409.44] and why is everybody sicker than ever
[3407.92 - 3410.64] before and why is everybody in the
[3409.44 - 3412.24] health movement getting sick
[3410.64 - 3414.56] and running for their lives to the other
[3412.24 - 3416.40] side animal protein people running to
[3414.56 - 3418.00] their lives to the vegan side vegan
[3416.40 - 3419.84] people running to their lives for their
[3418.00 - 3421.28] lives in the animal protein side because
[3419.84 - 3423.04] they're all still sick having problems
[3421.28 - 3424.56] oh my acne is back again i thought my
[3423.04 - 3426.16] vegan diet would fix it
[3424.56 - 3427.68] whoa wait a minute i was eating fruits
[3426.16 - 3429.84] and vegetables oh wait
[3427.68 - 3431.68] uh wait my uti's are back i thought my
[3429.84 - 3433.36] animal protein keto diet would fix it
[3431.68 - 3435.20] i'm back on vegan everybody's running
[3433.36 - 3437.20] back and forth
[3435.20 - 3438.80] and because nobody knew it was pathogens
[3437.20 - 3439.92] so medical medium information is the
[3438.80 - 3442.48] first time ever
[3439.92 - 3443.76] we got answers and more people and more
[3442.48 - 3445.76] healing stories than ever before in
[3443.76 - 3447.60] history from mm info so yeah
[3445.76 - 3449.28] you want to just you want to throw
[3447.60 - 3450.32] everything out of context not look at
[3449.28 - 3452.56] the details
[3450.32 - 3454.56] say hey nothing new to figure out here
[3452.56 - 3456.40] good be on your merry way i'm glad
[3454.56 - 3458.00] but i'll tell you when you get real sick
[3456.40 - 3460.56] down the road and
[3458.00 - 3462.16] you can't get better no matter what
[3460.56 - 3463.84] vegetable you're trying or whatever
[3462.16 - 3465.76] somebody's telling you to do or whatever
[3463.84 - 3467.68] collagen someone tell you to take
[3465.76 - 3468.96] whether animal protein or not when you
[3467.68 - 3470.64] can't get better down the road
[3468.96 - 3472.48] and you're 40 years old or whatever
[3470.64 - 3474.72] you're 42 years old and now you're sick
[3472.48 - 3476.24] and you saw your 10th neurologist
[3474.72 - 3477.76] remember medical medium information
[3476.24 - 3479.20] because it saved a tremendous amount of
[3477.76 - 3482.72] lives around the world
[3479.20 - 3483.84] right here revised and expanded
[3482.72 - 3486.72] but i'm glad you're here though i hope
[3483.84 - 3489.04] you stay on um
[3486.72 - 3490.28] annette so fermented veggies are dead
[3489.04 - 3493.84] but cooked or not
[3490.28 - 3497.60] correct i'm so confused
[3493.84 - 3500.48] correct okay so
[3497.60 - 3501.44] cooked is the state we put them in so
[3500.48 - 3504.48] that's the state
[3501.44 - 3510.48] we put the food in okay
[3504.48 - 3514.40] so when a vegetable is alive
[3510.48 - 3517.60] and dies and decays
[3514.40 - 3520.72] a natural death okay
[3517.60 - 3524.96] that's a different situation
[3520.72 - 3528.00] we don't take you have to understand
[3524.96 - 3528.64] when we eat animal meat you kill the
[3528.00 - 3533.20] animal
[3528.64 - 3536.96] right so people do they kill the animal
[3533.20 - 3540.80] okay and that's forcing
[3536.96 - 3544.80] that to die you see
[3540.80 - 3546.88] we forced the food to die in the moment
[3544.80 - 3548.08] people kill animals to eat animal
[3546.88 - 3551.28] protein they force
[3548.08 - 3553.60] the death on the animal right it's not
[3551.28 - 3555.92] an animal dead in the woods that died
[3553.60 - 3556.72] no one will touch the meat the meat's
[3555.92 - 3559.04] gone bad
[3556.72 - 3559.92] now the raccoons and the coyotes are
[3559.04 - 3562.48] coming
[3559.92 - 3564.96] you see the difference so if an animal
[3562.48 - 3567.84] dies naturally in the woods
[3564.96 - 3568.48] and it just falls to the ground right a
[3567.84 - 3571.60] bear
[3568.48 - 3572.48] a deer whatever kind of animal or a cow
[3571.60 - 3574.72] in a field
[3572.48 - 3575.92] just dies and falls over and it's
[3574.72 - 3579.44] sitting out there
[3575.92 - 3580.80] and it's starting to decay it passes a
[3579.44 - 3582.48] deadline
[3580.80 - 3584.08] there's a difference there you're not
[3582.48 - 3585.52] going to go out there be like that cow's
[3584.08 - 3588.08] been dead for like
[3585.52 - 3590.24] two days i'm gonna go cut up a piece of
[3588.08 - 3590.96] meat you're gonna be scared to death of
[3590.24 - 3594.00] that cow
[3590.96 - 3594.72] scared the death of that meat but when
[3594.00 - 3599.44] they
[3594.72 - 3601.84] fresh kill and preserve the food
[3599.44 - 3604.32] it's a different story when you have
[3601.84 - 3607.84] fresh produce and yes you steam it
[3604.32 - 3608.88] it's it's a variety of killing it but
[3607.84 - 3611.44] not the same
[3608.88 - 3614.08] thing what happens is there's not going
[3611.44 - 3616.24] to be any of that death bacteria growing
[3614.08 - 3618.16] in this steamed cooked food right now so
[3616.24 - 3618.96] when you steam a cauliflower you steam
[3618.16 - 3621.12] asparagus
[3618.96 - 3622.08] there's no bacteria that's going to want
[3621.12 - 3624.40] to surface
[3622.08 - 3626.24] and start to devour it through a natural
[3624.40 - 3627.12] process that we're not supposed to be
[3626.24 - 3628.80] involved with
[3627.12 - 3631.84] we're not supposed to be eating death
[3628.80 - 3635.52] bacteria there's none of that here
[3631.84 - 3637.20] we forced this to cook bacteria is not
[3635.52 - 3639.92] going to overcome it
[3637.20 - 3640.48] and it's freshly cooked that's the whole
[3639.92 - 3643.36] point
[3640.48 - 3644.80] it's not like decaying fruits and
[3643.36 - 3647.28] vegetables
[3644.80 - 3649.44] or decaying vegetables really and then
[3647.28 - 3652.64] it's sitting in vats while the death
[3649.44 - 3655.04] while the grim reaper the grim reaper's
[3652.64 - 3657.84] bacteria comes and overtakes it the
[3655.04 - 3660.96] stuff we're not supposed to really eat
[3657.84 - 3662.48] and um that's how it works
[3660.96 - 3664.08] the bacteria that's inside your small
[3662.48 - 3665.60] intestinal tract your duodenum small
[3664.08 - 3667.36] intestinal tract and colon is not the
[3665.60 - 3669.28] bacteria that's on fermented food by the
[3667.36 - 3670.80] way i'm just giving you a 4-1-1 on that
[3669.28 - 3673.52] that's not what it is
[3670.80 - 3674.16] the bacteria that you want inside your
[3673.52 - 3676.56] colon
[3674.16 - 3678.00] an intestinal tract okay your duodenum
[3676.56 - 3680.48] small intestinal tract and colon
[3678.00 - 3681.84] is the bacteria that's on something you
[3680.48 - 3684.08] picked out of the garden that has
[3681.84 - 3685.84] elevated biotics on it that's actually
[3684.08 - 3687.84] living on the leaf so that when you eat
[3685.84 - 3690.64] the parsley in that moment
[3687.84 - 3692.48] you're getting that elevated biotic
[3690.64 - 3694.32] that's where you get the microorganisms
[3692.48 - 3697.44] and it goes down into your helium then
[3694.32 - 3700.88] it sits down in there and it creates b12
[3697.44 - 3704.16] now if you ferment this parsley
[3700.88 - 3707.36] and ferment it and that
[3704.16 - 3710.08] grim reaper's death bacteria okay
[3707.36 - 3711.68] is in there with it that doesn't go down
[3710.08 - 3712.00] to your helium it doesn't even make it
[3711.68 - 3714.48] down
[3712.00 - 3715.28] there it gets killed off by your hcl in
[3714.48 - 3716.72] your stomach
[3715.28 - 3718.96] it's not the bacteria that actually
[3716.72 - 3722.64] produces b12 and it's not the beneficial
[3718.96 - 3722.64] bacteria that actually gives you life
[3722.80 - 3730.16] so it's important to know all right
[3726.32 - 3731.20] put another potato on top of here
[3730.16 - 3735.04] actually you know what i'm going to put
[3731.20 - 3735.04] just finish this tomato right here
[3735.44 - 3739.84] now you can do vinegar that's not that
[3737.60 - 3740.48] doesn't have the bacteria and you can do
[3739.84 - 3743.68] acv
[3740.48 - 3745.20] that has bacteria mother right
[3743.68 - 3747.36] well that mother never passes your
[3745.20 - 3749.28] stomach
[3747.36 - 3751.84] it gets eaten up by your hcl whatever's
[3749.28 - 3751.84] left of it
[3753.36 - 3758.64] something now i'm gonna put a little bit
[3755.36 - 3758.64] of this orange squeezed on top
[3762.40 - 3766.48] now personally me i would like a nice
[3764.88 - 3768.13] fresh juicy orange like that and not a
[3766.48 - 3769.52] fermented one
[3768.13 - 3772.72] [Music]
[3769.52 - 3772.72] squeeze a little orange on here
[3775.84 - 3783.84] i'm going to put a lemon on here too
[3785.84 - 3790.40] vinegar robs minerals from your teeth
[3788.56 - 3792.80] and bones
[3790.40 - 3794.88] more vinegar you do the more you lose
[3792.80 - 3797.92] your teeth later on
[3794.88 - 3799.84] vinegar is the teeth dissolver the teeth
[3797.92 - 3802.96] destroyer
[3799.84 - 3804.16] that's what it is it robs calcium from
[3802.96 - 3807.52] your bones
[3804.16 - 3810.80] calcium from your teeth
[3807.52 - 3814.00] because when you put
[3810.80 - 3816.24] acetic acid inside of you you need your
[3814.00 - 3819.60] body to dig out calcium
[3816.24 - 3824.24] so your body has to find calcium because
[3819.60 - 3827.68] acetic acid is so acidic it's so bad
[3824.24 - 3829.04] that you need your own calcium to try to
[3827.68 - 3832.80] neutralize it
[3829.04 - 3834.16] your body pushes out as vinegar sucks
[3832.80 - 3835.92] the life out of you it sucks the
[3834.16 - 3836.56] minerals out of you it sucks the calcium
[3835.92 - 3839.60] out of you
[3836.56 - 3842.08] your body pushes that calcium out of
[3839.60 - 3844.56] your teeth like here here save my life
[3842.08 - 3845.20] your body tries to save itself by
[3844.56 - 3847.04] emitting
[3845.20 - 3848.56] calcium from your bones and teeth when
[3847.04 - 3853.84] you take vinegar i don't care if it's
[3848.56 - 3853.84] acv it's all the same
[3854.48 - 3857.84] look there's all kinds of different
[3855.60 - 3859.44] spices you can put on a salad
[3857.84 - 3861.12] all right so let me just give you a
[3859.44 - 3863.36] quick run down here i got tomatoes i got
[3861.12 - 3866.08] onions cauliflower asparagus right
[3863.36 - 3867.44] right everything's in here spinach pea
[3866.08 - 3870.48] shoots
[3867.44 - 3871.84] and uh parsley um i'm gonna put a little
[3870.48 - 3874.40] chili powder on top
[3871.84 - 3874.40] can't help it
[3875.20 - 3881.84] vinegar is a like it's a preservative
[3879.28 - 3882.40] it's you ha i'm not on a preservative
[3881.84 - 3884.32] diet
[3882.40 - 3886.80] i don't do preservatives all my stuff's
[3884.32 - 3889.68] all natural um why are you putting acv
[3886.80 - 3890.32] on your food that's a preservative it is
[3889.68 - 3892.84] yeah
[3890.32 - 3894.16] it's a preservative acetic acid is a
[3892.84 - 3896.16] preservative
[3894.16 - 3898.56] putting a little chili chili uh pepper
[3896.16 - 3898.56] on here
[3900.32 - 3906.32] it's acetic acid
[3903.44 - 3907.92] it's a preservative you don't want
[3906.32 - 3909.44] preservatives because you end up
[3907.92 - 3912.64] pickling your own organs
[3909.44 - 3914.80] your liver it goes into like
[3912.64 - 3916.88] shock when you dump too much vinegar in
[3914.80 - 3920.00] there because it goes up into the liver
[3916.88 - 3923.52] and when it goes up into the liver
[3920.00 - 3925.20] you're pickling your liver
[3923.52 - 3926.96] you already have salt in your blood
[3925.20 - 3929.04] because we have sodium naturally
[3926.96 - 3930.48] occurring in the bloodstream
[3929.04 - 3932.24] right i'm not even just talking about
[3930.48 - 3933.92] the sodium we're adding and what happens
[3932.24 - 3937.44] is when you
[3933.92 - 3940.72] put vinegar and sodium together
[3937.44 - 3944.32] you're now really preserving your organs
[3940.72 - 3944.32] you're pickling your own organs
[3949.20 - 3952.40] look i don't have fun telling you guys
[3950.96 - 3956.48] all this stuff
[3952.40 - 3958.32] all right this is onion powder
[3956.48 - 3960.08] it's got really a great flavor when you
[3958.32 - 3962.80] put it on top of like a potato salad
[3960.08 - 3964.16] with all these vegetables
[3962.80 - 3966.08] there's not much on there i probably did
[3964.16 - 3967.68] a teaspoon and a half and a little bit
[3966.08 - 3970.16] of ground coriander i'm going to put on
[3967.68 - 3970.16] top too
[3971.20 - 3979.84] a little bit on top
[3981.28 - 3986.48] um so you got to think about that
[3984.48 - 3989.04] it's just like a jar of pickles you
[3986.48 - 3992.48] stick acetic acid in there
[3989.04 - 3993.52] and you stick salt and now you got your
[3992.48 - 3996.64] pickle in the middle
[3993.52 - 3998.96] and the life is sucked out of the pickle
[3996.64 - 4000.96] which is the cucumber the life is sucked
[3998.96 - 4003.76] out of it the more vinegar we do
[4000.96 - 4005.60] and the salt we do we're slowly sucking
[4003.76 - 4008.24] the life out of our
[4005.60 - 4009.28] we're trying to preserve ourselves we're
[4008.24 - 4012.80] preserving ourselves
[4009.28 - 4014.32] in a bad way you see how it goes
[4012.80 - 4020.40] and then on top of that all the other
[4014.32 - 4021.76] stuff we do
[4020.40 - 4024.32] some of the most powerful people in the
[4021.76 - 4026.24] world always reach out
[4024.32 - 4027.76] um some of the best doctors in the world
[4026.24 - 4028.96] reach out
[4027.76 - 4030.40] and they're always they always tell me
[4028.96 - 4031.20] the same thing many of them ask me the
[4030.40 - 4033.60] same thing what
[4031.20 - 4034.72] is what should i look out for what
[4033.60 - 4036.16] should i do
[4034.72 - 4038.16] you're the number one health author in
[4036.16 - 4039.68] the world seven years young seven years
[4038.16 - 4041.36] running

[4047.92 - 4051.12] people in the world who reach out to me
[4049.20 - 4052.80] like what can i do anthony
[4051.12 - 4054.32] and i'm like first things first get rid
[4052.80 - 4055.84] of the vinegar
[4054.32 - 4057.76] right there get rid of the eggs and
[4055.84 - 4059.36] they're like what what
[4057.76 - 4061.52] i've been to 100 doctors the best
[4059.36 - 4063.12] neurologist in the world i travel around
[4061.52 - 4065.60] in my private jets everywhere
[4063.12 - 4066.48] and go see the best healers ever what is
[4065.60 - 4068.48] this
[4066.48 - 4069.84] and i'm like no vinegar like okay i
[4068.48 - 4071.04] better write this down
[4069.84 - 4072.88] most powerful people in the world they
[4071.04 - 4073.60] got the best doctors the best care they
[4072.88 - 4077.12] can find
[4073.60 - 4078.40] let me write this down and with all that
[4077.12 - 4081.04] help they're trying to find and the best
[4078.40 - 4083.04] healers are still sick and like
[4081.04 - 4084.40] i'm like yeah get rid of the vinegar
[4083.04 - 4087.20] okay get rid of the caffeine
[4084.40 - 4089.36] huh caffeine i heard it was good for me
[4087.20 - 4091.68] no get rid of the caffeine
[4089.36 - 4093.52] get rid of the eggs eggs i have a
[4091.68 - 4094.16] hard-boiled egg every morning get rid of
[4093.52 - 4096.72] the eggs
[4094.16 - 4098.32] like why because it's feeding your virus
[4096.72 - 4099.68] that's making you sick and giving you
[4098.32 - 4104.32] your lupus
[4099.68 - 4107.92] it is i haven't heard that anywhere
[4104.32 - 4110.32] you know anyway that's just one of
[4107.92 - 4113.28] dozens of examples put a little lemon on
[4110.32 - 4113.28] here to finish this off
[4114.64 - 4118.08] you guys i talked about b12 a little bit
[4116.40 - 4118.64] i want to run this b12 thing by you
[4118.08 - 4120.96] right here
[4118.64 - 4122.32] here's what you have to understand if
[4120.96 - 4124.32] this has nothing to do with animal
[4122.32 - 4125.44] protein me liking animal protein or not
[4124.32 - 4128.00] has nothing to do with this it's
[4125.44 - 4130.72] information you have to see it like this
[4128.00 - 4132.48] if you're somebody that thinks you're
[4130.72 - 4134.80] getting your b12 from your animal
[4132.48 - 4138.24] protein you're not
[4134.80 - 4142.48] because b12 produced by
[4138.24 - 4147.52] animals isn't the b12 your body utilizes
[4142.48 - 4150.56] it's there for the animal our bodies
[4147.52 - 4154.96] need a certain type of b12 okay
[4150.56 - 4156.20] one either produced by us or one
[4154.96 - 4158.08] that's a methylcobalamin
[4156.20 - 4159.68] adenosilcobalamin so that's the vimergy
[4158.08 - 4162.80] one that i take every day
[4159.68 - 4165.68] so that's how our bodies work
[4162.80 - 4166.80] so if you're not eating all of the
[4165.68 - 4169.60] garden
[4166.80 - 4170.72] vegetables that have the microorganisms
[4169.60 - 4174.08] on top
[4170.72 - 4176.40] to create your own b12 and your ilium
[4174.08 - 4177.28] then you need a supplement that's how it
[4176.40 - 4179.68] works
[4177.28 - 4181.04] and so like that's the one i recommend
[4179.68 - 4182.72] all the time is the vimers you want i'm
[4181.04 - 4184.88] not sponsored
[4182.72 - 4187.28] but if you think you're getting b12 from
[4184.88 - 4190.40] your chicken you're not because the b12
[4187.28 - 4193.92] is create that your chicken creates
[4190.40 - 4195.84] is b12 for your chicken that was when
[4193.92 - 4198.80] your chicken was alive
[4195.84 - 4201.28] it needed the b12 to stay alive that b12
[4198.80 - 4202.40] identifies with its own nervous system
[4201.28 - 4204.88] and brain
[4202.40 - 4207.36] and the same thing with the cow the
[4204.88 - 4210.00] cow's b12
[4207.36 - 4211.12] is produced for the cow's nervous system
[4210.00 - 4214.48] and brain
[4211.12 - 4217.12] the b12 we produce is produced
[4214.48 - 4219.20] for our nervous system in our brain
[4217.12 - 4222.16] right and our organs
[4219.20 - 4222.80] that's how it works with b12 so hey no
[4222.16 - 4224.80] you're getting pl
[4222.80 - 4227.04] your vegans don't get b12 well animal
[4224.80 - 4229.52] protein people don't get b12 either
[4227.04 - 4230.08] plant-based people don't get b12 they
[4229.52 - 4233.92] don't
[4230.08 - 4237.20] no no one's getting b12
[4233.92 - 4240.64] no one is unless you're eating
[4237.20 - 4243.76] enough vegetables greens
[4240.64 - 4247.20] out of your garden or picking
[4243.76 - 4249.28] fresh berries out of your garden
[4247.20 - 4251.20] and there's the microorganisms on top of
[4249.28 - 4253.12] there that microorganism goes down to
[4251.20 - 4254.48] your helium and creates your b12 right
[4253.12 - 4255.92] but people lack this
[4254.48 - 4257.36] and they don't have enough of those
[4255.92 - 4258.24] fresh picked vegetables with
[4257.36 - 4262.08] microorganisms
[4258.24 - 4264.88] on it and so plant-based people
[4262.08 - 4267.52] animal protein people vegetarians
[4264.88 - 4269.44] they're not getting b12
[4267.52 - 4270.96] so in order to heal and heal
[4269.44 - 4272.64] neurological problems you've got to
[4270.96 - 4273.92] supplement with b12 i've been saying
[4272.64 - 4276.48] this for years
[4273.92 - 4277.28] and i've recommended different b12s over
[4276.48 - 4279.12] the years
[4277.28 - 4281.44] that's the best one there is on the
[4279.12 - 4283.20] market today in the highest quality with
[4281.44 - 4284.96] no junk and no preservatives know
[4283.20 - 4286.64] anything and it's the vimorgy one
[4284.96 - 4289.00] so if you guys want to know the b12 i
[4286.64 - 4290.64] use it's the vimergy these are victor
[4289.00 - 4294.08] i-m-e-r-g-y
[4290.64 - 4295.20] but b-12 is make or break in your
[4294.08 - 4296.72] healing process
[4295.20 - 4298.72] i'm going to be straight out about that
[4296.72 - 4299.28] it's make or break in your healing
[4298.72 - 4302.24] process
[4299.28 - 4303.20] b12 is critical you got fibro you got ms
[4302.24 - 4305.12] you got lupus
[4303.20 - 4307.60] you got dysautonomia you got whatever it
[4305.12 - 4308.96] is pots you got parkinson's you got any
[4307.60 - 4311.04] kind of condition
[4308.96 - 4312.64] it could be memory issues anxiety
[4311.04 - 4315.92] depression b12 is
[4312.64 - 4316.88] make or break it really is been saying
[4315.92 - 4318.96] that for years
[4316.88 - 4320.88] i talk about it in the books i got the
[4318.96 - 4324.40] b12 i talk about in the new edition
[4320.88 - 4326.24] okay it's make or break
[4324.40 - 4327.60] and that's the difference and i teach
[4326.24 - 4329.44] doctors that all the time
[4327.60 - 4331.28] if they're not getting enough b12 well
[4329.44 - 4332.24] hey mr william well the only thing is is
[4331.28 - 4334.56] they look like they
[4332.24 - 4335.84] they test okay for their b12 that
[4334.56 - 4337.60] doesn't test
[4335.84 - 4339.84] how much b12 is in their brain and
[4337.60 - 4341.68] nervous system you can't measure that
[4339.84 - 4343.76] there's no blood test that can test how
[4341.68 - 4346.48] much is in the brain and nervous system
[4343.76 - 4348.24] or in the liver you don't know so you
[4346.48 - 4349.92] have to keep the b12 going i teach
[4348.24 - 4351.92] doctors this all the time it's make or
[4349.92 - 4355.28] break to the finish line of healing
[4351.92 - 4357.20] anyway you guys it's a full moon

[4375.92 - 4380.08] all kinds of emotional wounds hardships
[4378.08 - 4380.56] breakups and relationships wounds that
[4380.08 - 4382.56] we've
[4380.56 - 4383.68] stinging in our life people letting us
[4382.56 - 4385.76] down
[4383.68 - 4387.12] right being let down whatever it is
[4385.76 - 4388.48] happening or if you're just struggling
[4387.12 - 4390.48] with a chronic illness
[4388.48 - 4392.40] the moon meditation take advantage of it
[4390.48 - 4393.44] have you guys done it i know many of you
[4392.40 - 4396.88] guys have
[4393.44 - 4399.12] yep yes love the moon meditation
[4396.88 - 4401.12] um carol says he has incorrect
[4399.12 - 4404.08] information about b12 b12
[4401.12 - 4405.12] is bioavailable from meat it's funny
[4404.08 - 4406.24] because there's no science that
[4405.12 - 4409.12] determines that
[4406.24 - 4409.92] so i guess you're just making it up
[4409.12 - 4413.20] because
[4409.92 - 4415.28] i have a source so carol i actually have
[4413.20 - 4416.72] a source of information that's already
[4415.28 - 4417.76] proven to track record and healed
[4416.72 - 4420.24] millions around the world
[4417.76 - 4421.60] okay so that's already there i don't
[4420.24 - 4423.60] have anything to prove
[4421.60 - 4424.88] but science has a lot to prove because
[4423.60 - 4426.72] they haven't proven that
[4424.88 - 4428.00] there's no science study that says it's
[4426.72 - 4429.44] bioavailable for meat
[4428.00 - 4431.68] they haven't even determined that they
[4429.44 - 4434.32] can't even measure that so
[4431.68 - 4435.12] science has let you down okay but
[4434.32 - 4438.24] apparently
[4435.12 - 4439.20] the information to get people to d the
[4438.24 - 4441.36] tools they need
[4439.20 - 4442.96] from my source hasn't let people down
[4441.36 - 4443.68] and millions of heli are healing because
[4442.96 - 4445.60] of it
[4443.68 - 4447.28] and bodies are still a mystery to
[4445.60 - 4449.36] science why people are sick so
[4447.28 - 4450.32] okay science knows that they believe
[4449.36 - 4452.56] that they do
[4450.32 - 4454.48] well 250 million americans are sick with
[4452.56 - 4456.16] conditions and symptoms
[4454.48 - 4457.52] billions around the planet are sick with
[4456.16 - 4459.76] symptoms and conditions
[4457.52 - 4461.44] but they know all of a sudden that meat
[4459.76 - 4462.96] is bioavailable they can't even measure
[4461.44 - 4464.40] that they can't even test that
[4462.96 - 4467.12] think about it it's not even testable
[4464.40 - 4469.20] there's no study that actually shows
[4467.12 - 4470.16] that they can actually determine if it's
[4469.20 - 4473.20] bioavailable
[4470.16 - 4474.56] that doesn't exist so i get it throw
[4473.20 - 4477.76] stuff out there if you need to
[4474.56 - 4479.84] totally get it but you know it
[4477.76 - 4481.44] your information is wrong that's all
[4479.84 - 4483.52] your information's incorrect
[4481.44 - 4484.48] but you know what the street cred is
[4483.52 - 4486.72] here
[4484.48 - 4488.48] millions have healed raging eczema
[4486.72 - 4489.52] psoriasis disorders
[4488.48 - 4491.44] all kinds of different conditions
[4489.52 - 4493.68] anxiety disorders gut problems you name
[4491.44 - 4496.00] it have healed when nothing else could
[4493.68 - 4496.88] that right there is already a proven
[4496.00 - 4499.20] track record
[4496.88 - 4500.32] and that information came from my source
[4499.20 - 4503.52] and my source
[4500.32 - 4504.88] says okay instead of science says my
[4503.52 - 4507.84] source says
[4504.88 - 4508.48] that the b12 produced by an animal is
[4507.84 - 4512.96] made
[4508.48 - 4514.48] for the animal that animal had no
[4512.96 - 4517.04] understanding that it was going to be
[4514.48 - 4519.68] used for people to eat
[4517.04 - 4521.36] animals the animal's body wasn't
[4519.68 - 4522.96] designed or made
[4521.36 - 4525.28] to determine it was going to be eaten
[4522.96 - 4528.00] someday that's not what happened
[4525.28 - 4529.44] so the animals b12 is for the animal's
[4528.00 - 4532.00] nervous system to survive
[4529.44 - 4532.96] it's not for a human's nervous system it
[4532.00 - 4535.52] does not code
[4532.96 - 4536.16] over to a human to a human's nervous
[4535.52 - 4537.76] system
[4536.16 - 4539.52] your b12 that's produced in your
[4537.76 - 4541.44] intestinal tract
[4539.52 - 4542.80] is the is the b12 that's for your
[4541.44 - 4546.00] nervous system
[4542.80 - 4547.68] so just a little food for thought there
[4546.00 - 4550.00] you guys check out the moon meditation
[4547.68 - 4552.72] medical medium podcast at apple podcast
