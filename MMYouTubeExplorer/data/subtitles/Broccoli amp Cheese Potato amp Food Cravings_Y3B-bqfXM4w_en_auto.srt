people and they they make up stuff

191
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,800
they say stuff it's actually evil right

192
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
it's amazing and so someone's going to

193
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,080
get thwarted

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,759
and then they're going to have to go on

195
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
that 30 catherine they're going to have

196
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
to go on that 30-year journey because

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,520
they got thwarted

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
and they're going to be now they got

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,720
derailed so now they're going to go on

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
that 30-year journey

201
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
where celery juice nope it's bad for you

202
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,520
um

203
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:27,599
medical medium no he talks to ghosts um

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
you know and now i'm now they start

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,880
their journey there's so many people

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
that are starting their journey fresh

207
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
from the start and they're going to see

208
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
their next 30 years so they're 20 years

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
old or they're 25 years old they're

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
30 years old and they get told that

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,599
science has all the answers

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
it's science science has all the answers

213
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
and so they're just never going to break

214
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,479
from that and then they're just going to

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
be going on their journey but you know

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,479
what's funny

217
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,080
so many areas of medicine use medical

218
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,520
medium information that were originally

219
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,919
published from mm right

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
they use the info so tidbits are getting

221
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,680
into their protocols out there

222
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,879
and that's what's helping people who are

223
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,240
on that 30-year journey

224
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,479
they start to get a little bit better

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
because they're during a couple of the

226
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,759
you know protocols are incorporating in

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,240

idea okay it was never a great idea it's

435
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
first of all carrots are not man-made

436
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,519
carrots are not man-made man-made like

437
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,759
people think right they're not

438
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
unless you know you gotta understand the

439
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,160
difference between

440
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,639
gmo right and non-gmo you got to

441
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,680
understand the difference between

442
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,920
hybridization

443
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:07,199
okay and hybridization is a process that

444
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,199
we've been using we've been using um

445
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,600
you know the the whole thing is like

446
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,680
this it's it's

447
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
it depends on what you okay here's the

448
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,880
other thing all of our food

449
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,600
has been worked on in the sense

450
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,360
where we have crafted it along the

451
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,560
thousands and thousands of years you

452
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,680
always got to remember this

453
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,720
right you can't here's how food worked

454
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,079
originally

455
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:36,000
there's only so many there's there's

456
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:39,440
only so many foods you can consume

457
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,839
from the wild that you can eat enough of

458
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,279
keep this in mind all right because i'm

459
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
going to give you like a little bit more

460
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,560
info than just hey or carrots good or

461
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,639
bad are they man-made or not we got to

462
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
go we got to do better than that

463
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,880
and it comes down to this like wild food

464
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,480
is intense

465
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,440
really really intense and what we've had

466
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
to do

467
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:05,199
what mankind has had to do over these

468
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,839
thousands of years is we had to

469
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,640
we had to work our food that means when

470
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,439
you when an

471
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,160
apple tree grows right from a seed

472
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,280
okay right and those apples come out on

473
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,319
that tree

474
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,079
right those apples may not be so

475
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,199
agreeable

476
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,959
so you take the apple and then

477
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,720
you bite into it and you're like ah

478
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,200
that's a sour apple

479
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,000
that's a sour apple this is seven

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,799
thousand years ago

481
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,960
that's a that's a that's a sour apple

482
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,440
and then you see it's got a seed in it

483
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
right i'm gonna take that seed out let

484
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,559
me take the seed out of that apple

485
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,799
and i'm gonna plant that seed in the

486
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,679
ground and another tree comes up

487
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
and you wait years later right a few

488
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
years later some

489
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,240
five years later it's all of a sudden

490
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
you get all these flowers and now you

491
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,320
got apples again

492
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
and you're like let me try that apple

493
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,559
you bite it

494
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,240
oh my god that apples that apple's worse

495
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,360
that apple's worse

496
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,200
right let me let me open that apple up

497
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,720
and then take another seed out and then

498
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,160
you put the seed back in the ground and

499
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,600
you grow another tree

500
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
this is really important information

501
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,520
because there's so much confusion around

502
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
food

503
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
okay and now you got another tree and

504
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
then when that tree finally gives you

505
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,960
flowers

506
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,400
and you get an apple right you pluck

507
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
that apple

508
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
and now you bite it and you're like whoa

509
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
wait a minute

510
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
there was that one seed that was in that

511
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
apple

512
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,360
that last apple that grew this tree and

513
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
gave me an apple

514
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,280
that actually tastes pretty good but i

515
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,640
don't want to lose this

516
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,960
i don't want to lose this taste

517
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
you see i don't want to lose this taste

518
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,840
of this apple

519
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,840
so i got two options ready

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:57,840
where's lorraine tonight we got another

521
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,840
disaster recovery going on here

522
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,440
i think i just burnt my carrots and

523
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,440
broccoli turn it

524
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,000
just like in our comment um

525
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:20,400
so now we got two we got two options

526
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,480
and here they are we can now cut

527
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
cut a branch off that apple tree you

528
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,640
guys this is important

529
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,440
cut we can we can yeah we can cut the

530
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,440
branch off

531
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
and then in the spring before the leaves

532
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,480
come out on that

533
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,600
other apple tree that wasn't great

534
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,559
that tasted terrible we can now cut

535
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
that branch we can cut a little nook in

536
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
it

537
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
we can take the other branch from the

538
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,840
apple we like and then we can

539
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,600
graft that branch on yeah put a little

540
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
mud on it back then because 7 000 years

541
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,919
ago they didn't have grafting tape

542
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,200
or maybe a little piece of leather and

543
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,400
and all of a sudden now

544
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,080
the graft takes and now we got that

545
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,640
terrible apple tree that has an arm on

546
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,640
it now

547
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,960
of good apples you see how it works

548
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,880
okay that's not man-made

549
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,919
it's all natural baby all natural

550
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,600
right important to know okay

551
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,159
i think this is ready i'm gonna shut

552
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,640
this down a little bit

553
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,440
it's getting ready right okay so keep

554
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
that in mind

555
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,799
that's one option the other option is

556
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,000
the apple tastes good

557
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,520
right so let's get a seed from the apple

558
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,679
that tastes good

559
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
let's save all the seeds in the apple

560
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,600
that tastes good and let's plant

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,440
those seeds all of them and then all

562
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
these trees come up and now they throw

563
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
apples out and then you grab the apple

564
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,000
off each tree and you bite into and you

565
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,000
go up don't like that one

566
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
but it's pretty good oh bite that one

567
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,600
not bad oh this one's even better

568
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
and now that apple you hang on to those

569
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
seeds

570
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,840
and then you plant those seeds in the

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,720
ground and as time goes on

572
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
you get the most incredible apples and

573
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,960
that

574
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,720
is how we feed ourselves carrots

575
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
they grow in the wild there's wild

576
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,400
carrots in the wild

577
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,520
right but they are really hard to eat

578
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
there's wild onions in the wild there's

579
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,440
wild

580
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,760
chives there's wild all of it we have

581
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,360
we had to over the hundreds of years and

582
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
hundreds of years in order to consume

583
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,360
enough food

584
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,200
we had to pick the best that was to our

585
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:36,480
liking in every way right

586
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
we had to pick the best okay

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
we're going to cook this a little bit

588
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
more

589
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,880
put a little bit more water in there

590
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,600
okay here's how it works okay i'm

591
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,679
cooking

592
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,039
um i want the broccoli soft i'm steaming

593
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,520
the broccoli i want it soft

594
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,960
right i want the carrots to be soft i'm

595
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,360
going to use the carrots in the

596
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,640
sauce the cheese that's what i'm going

597
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,840
to do the broccoli

598
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
is going to go in the center of the

599
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,600
potato but we haven't even hit our

600
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,480
toppings yet of the night all right

601
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,360
people make a mistake with vegetables

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,280
they barely

603
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,520
cook them and then because the

604
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,720
vegetable's not raw anymore

605
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,840
it makes it harder to digest harder to

606
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,679
digest so

607
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,280
what happens is if you're somebody with

608
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
sensitive digestion and you want to

609
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,280
steam broccoli you

610
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,280
steam it soft so that fork goes right

611
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,080
through it right

612
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
so that fork goes right through it like

613
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
right through it you steam it soft so

614
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,240
that fork goes right through it

615
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,280
if you steam it lightly and it's still

616
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,600
crunchy

617
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,320
now it's going to be harder to digest or

618
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,880
you're going to

619
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,400
feel it rub things as it's going through

620
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
you of your sensitive digestion

621
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,200
annette why do you recommend cruciferous

622
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
vegetables

623
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
in your thyroid book they made me feel

624
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
worse so i stopped eating them

625
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,880
i thought you're not supposed to eat

626
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
them when you have a compromised letter

627
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,960
is it dr sebby no no it's not oh sorry

628
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,200
okay now uh yeah hello

629
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,720
yeah this is the head of the this is

630
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,679
head of the science research

631
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,640
alternative healing department right

632
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,919
here

633
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,640
we we told everybody

634
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,280
that don't eat cruciferous vegetables

635
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,880
because it interferes with the thyroid

636
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:32,799
because it's got gorgeogenic compounds

637
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,159
uh-huh yep were we wrong yeah

638
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,440
we were wrong a hundred percent

639
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,200
uh because we don't even know why

640
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,039
i'm the head of alternative medicine

641
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
right here yeah head of alternative

642
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,480
medicine

643
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,480
we don't even know why people even have

644
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,279
a thyroid problem

645
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,799
yeah you know right you know that yep we

646
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,679
don't know why people have a sick

647
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,440
thyroid

648
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,279
but we're gonna be experts on what

649
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
they're gonna eat

650
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,440
yep we're gonna be experts that's right

651
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,120
we're gonna scare them away from

652
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,400
cruciferous

653
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,200
uh-huh what people don't know is that

654
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,720
cruciferous helps their thyroid

655
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
uh-huh yeah and i'm i'm gonna hand this

656
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,520
over

657
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,799
let's hand it over to aw yep hanging up

658
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,200
so here's how it works with that

659
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,240
gorgeogenic compounds do not interfere

660
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,279
with the thyroid

661
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,559
um that's a theory theory

662
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,080
not proven no science behind it

663
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,159
theory okay keep that in mind number one

664
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,120
and that's a problem all on its own not

665
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,480
to mention

666
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,360
goitrogenic compounds they're in for in

667
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
foods there's anti-gorgogenic compounds

668
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,200
no one's talking about those

669
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,760
that's another thing all on its own it

670
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,840
would take barrels and barrels and

671
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,039
barrels of broccoli

672
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,000
to even consider the possibility of

673
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,720
possibly interfering and even then it

674
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,799
wouldn't

675
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,559
because of the anti-gorgogenic compounds

676
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,440
in cruciferous that's something to know

677
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,640
right there

678
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,080
um so i'm going to talk about also

679
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,679
another thing as well

680
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,279
so i'm just letting you know now if you

681
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,080
don't if you don't

682
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,320
feel good when you're eating broccoli or

683
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,360
cauliflower or anything keep in mind

684
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,000
if it's not steamed super soft it's

685
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
going to rub your inflamed areas

686
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,120
because if you're somebody already with

687
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,120
all these other conditions or even even

688
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,320
kind of digestion system issue or

689
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
bloating and that

690
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
it's it's steamed where it's lightly

691
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,400
steamed and hard really hard

692
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,720
it's going to be kind of still crunchy

693
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,200
and rubbing on everything and what i

694
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
like

695
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,799
for people who have sensitive systems is

696
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
to

697
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,000
have it you know have it soft right so

698
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,240
it's not rubbing so

699
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,679
it's not rubbing so keep that in mind

700
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,520
right so you guys um

701
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,000
but here's that's one thing right there

702
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,559
but there is there's a farce out there

703
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,720
about

704
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,240
uh about cruciferous they're gonna tell

705
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,039
you you can't do cruciferous because of

706
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,440
your thyroid

707
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
right stay away from kale collard greens

708
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
broccoli cauliflower

709
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,400
um you know and whatever else is in you

710
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,039
know cabbage

711
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
right so stay away from the cruciferous

712
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,960
family

713
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,679
that's what you're going to be told it's

714
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,520
it's misinformation it's painful

715
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,720
misinformation it's a really good

716
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,400
question um

717
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
that came up about it and yeah

718
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
malcolm why am i craving gluten so much

719
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
that's the only

720
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,960
no food i am craving for two years now

721
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,400
and really

722
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,120
have to have strong will to not give in

723
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,799
like this bagel that's got gluten in it

724
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,960
bacon cream cheese and that bagel's got

725
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,320
gluten in it right there right

726
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,799
um okay so why because gluten is feeding

727
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,520
a pathogen inside of you keep that in

728
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,240
mind

729
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,600
a bug a bug that lives inside of you and

730
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
that little buggy

731
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,520
loves gluten so let's do them little

732
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,480
demo here

733
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,640
demo depends on what bug i want to pick

734
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,520
we got the bacteria streptococcus eats

735
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,840
gluten

736
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
that right there can do it epstein-barr

737
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,799
sedimental virus

738
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,640
shingles they all eat gluten c diff

739
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,440
c diff eats gluten staph

740
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,240
eats gluten what else eats gluten um e

741
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,200
coli

742
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,880
loves gluten so everybody's got a

743
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
different range of bugs right they might

744
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,399
have different ranges of bacteria they

745
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,760
might have different kinds of bacteria

746
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,000
some people have more seed f

747
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
c diff then they do streptococcus some

748
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
people have more streptococcus than they

749
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
do e coli right

750
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,039
but that bacteria learns to feed off of

751
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,200
that gluten right

752
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,200
so that's what the bacteria does i got a

753
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,880
non-gluten-free cookie in my hand right

754
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,880
i get a bagel and cream cheese but i got

755
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
a piece of bread right so what happens

756
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,600
is that bacteria

757
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,880
loves that gluten so that bacteria

758
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,440
is thinking for you it can think

759
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
for you a little bit okay when it gets

760
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,520
hungry

761
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,399
it gets really hungry it's going to go

762
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,200
through withdrawal

763
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,240
when with when a pocket of bacteria goes

764
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,679
through withdrawal

765
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,000
that's originally medical medium

766
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,440
information going back decades when it

767
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,720
goes through withdrawal

768
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
that's going to be a little bit of a

769
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,960
persuasion that's going to occur

770
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,480
a persuasion and because i'll tell you

771
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,760
why

772
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,960
some of these bacterias

773
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,000
come from places in our life

774
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,440
where there was an emotional connection

775
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,320
okay a relationship

776
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,520
right picking up the streptococcus from

777
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,440
somebody else

778
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:34,320
in a relationship right

779
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,320
this is now done

780
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,120
that alone can actually bring an

781
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,120
emotional component to it

782
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
that's just one thing we'll go into

783
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,559
other reasons too why it happens with

784
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,799
with

785
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,200
also gluten emotionally you might have

786
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,320
been hurt in your life betrayal

787
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,840
everybody this all pertains to all of us

788
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
betrayal trust breakage something could

789
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,799
have happened

790
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:10,399
right and guess what

791
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,360
we would since childhood we would eat

792
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,640
something like some pasta that had

793
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,760
gluten in it

794
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,720
some cheesy pasta right

795
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,720
some pizza some pizza right

796
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,039
pizza and we would eat something

797
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,399
and we would eat something for our

798
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
emotions

799
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,600
that gluten would stay in us too it

800
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
would sit inside our liver that's

801
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,360
another thing all on its own

802
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,799
these are just a couple of reasons right

803
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,080
here we're talking about cravings

804
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,399
that was a good question though it's

805
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,679
perfect because it gives us it gives us

806
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,000

994
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,560

995
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,000
gonna put this in here this is the

996
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:36,160
potato i'm gonna put in here so

997
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:38,320
i'm making the cheese as we speak

998
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,000
right and i'm going to put these carrot

999
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,040
pieces in here too

1000
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,400
right you can do about a tablespoon of

1001
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,520
chopped carrot i'm going to put a little

1002
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,960
bit more

1003
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,240
because i have more here and

1004
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,480
so i'm going to put a little bit more in

1005
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,320
here to put the carrot pieces these are

1006
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,760
steamed soft because i'm making the

1007
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,800
sauce

1008
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,320
right that kind of blatant stupidity or

1009
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,560
i don't know what it is negligence or

1010
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,760
careless carelessness on

1011
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,560
um ebv being uh beneficial or in the

1012
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,200
virus as being

1013
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,640
beneficial is really really difficult

1014
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,160
you know for a lot i mean just when you

1015
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
think about it because then

1016
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,200
what's going to happen too is people are

1017
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
going to also like

1018
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
when they learn more and more about

1019
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,400
epstein-barr they're going to want

1020
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,079
epstein-barr because you'll be like well

1021
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,359
it's beneficial i was told it's good to

1022
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,960
have

1023
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,560
and that's going to be ridiculous so

1024
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
what i'm doing is i'm adding some spices

1025
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,440
right here

1026
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,640
a little bit of turmeric a quarter

1027
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,079
teaspoon of turmeric

1028
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,079
but put a little bit of that in right

1029
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,680
and i'm going to do a little bit of

1030
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,839
cayenne powder in here too right a

1031
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,240
little touch of it quarter teaspoon of

1032
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,000
cayenne mean

1033
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,119
it depends on how spicy you want it but

1034
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
that's what i'm going to say half a

1035
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,000
teaspoon of garlic powder

1036
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,000
put that in here

1037
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,240
that one's a little dried up on the

1038
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,119
bottom a little touch so i'm going to

1039
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,440
actually open this up

1040
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,440

1041
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,960

good garlic powder in there

1045
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,240
and then two teaspoons of onion powder

1046
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,680

1050
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,320
gonna add a little bit more which we're

1051
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,160

get knocked around

1353
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:02,160
in this world right from childhood

1354
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
on from elementary school being wounded

1355
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,000
there

1356
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,640
and and the food it's like the food hits

1357
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,880
where

have to have this food

1361
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,160
and that's one reason why we get the

1362
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,800
cravings because then we go through life

1363
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,680

1364
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,359

and so it life is hard right

1368
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,280
and then what happens is when we get

1369
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,040
that bad news

1370
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,960

i gotta fly i gotta fly and the yellow

1389
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,000
shirt doesn't really help the situation

1390
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,440
actually i'm thinking about it the whole

1391
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,319
yellow shirt probably doesn't help as

1392
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,280
i'm flying

1393
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,760
canary and you know what what happens is

1394
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,520
that

1395
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,160
or the toucan or something like you know

1396
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,880
there's what happens is that

1397
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,240
it's fight or flight when we go through

1398
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,640
something right

1399
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,280
and that fight or flight that adrenaline

1400
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,000
surging

1401
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,640
and that adrenaline scorches man

1402
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,680
scorches and in that adrenaline

1403
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,800
is information of that wound

1404
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,920
instantly instantly that adrenaline

1405
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,920
that's being released

1406
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,200
from that breakup that hardship that

1407
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,160

1412
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,880

that's part of it okay and then

1451
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,720
something else could happen

1452
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:39,599
right we stop eating we stop eating

1453
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:42,640

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,000
days

1456
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,400
when i even look at food i want to throw

1457
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,960
up

1458
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,760
when i even think about food my stomach

1459
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,720

1460
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,400

1461
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,720
emotional agony

1462
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,440
and i can't touch food but as that time

1463
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,440
goes on

1464
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,119
you lose all this glucose and mineral

1465
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,880
salts to your brain

1466
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,559
even if your diet was a poor diet it

1467
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,920
still gave you some glucose to the brain

1468
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,680
some mineral salts of the brain even

1469
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,680
know if it wasn't even the best

1470
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,960
but then as time goes on you start

1471
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,440
losing that glucose

1472
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,880
and then the flip side happens it flip

1473
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,640
it gets reversed

1474
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,920
boom you're now on the other end of it

1475
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,520
and you're eating everything

1476
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,200
and you're just you're you're just

1477
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,760
you're having your bagels and cream

1478
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,680

your ice cream you're still

1482
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:34,640
sick over your hurt and hardship

1483
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,920
but you're still you're still

1484
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,559
you're still hurt but now you're eating

1485
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,400
right and then the emotional wave comes

1486
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,319
in again and now you're not eating

1487
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,400
because you're you're hurt and it's

1488
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,280
hitting you over again ptsd starts

1489
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,040
happening

1490
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,200
and it's this up and down rollercoaster

1491
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,520
ride for a lot of people maybe a lot of

1492
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:56,079
you guys have been through this right

1493
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,760
and now we're we're like back and forth

1494
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,400
from eating bad

1495
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,400
to not eating at all eating bad to not

1496
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,200
eating at all eating for comfort to not

1497
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,559
eating at all

1498
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,480
right this could happen when you're

1499
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,920
eight nine ten years old five years old

1500
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,040
this could happen when you're 20 years

1501
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,160
old this could happen when you're 30

1502
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,119
years old could happen now

1503
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,559
but the pattern set in place and that

1504
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,520
adrenaline

1505
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,040
sits inside of us from those hardships

1506
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,680
you have that breakup you have that

1507
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,760
hardship

1508
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,880
that adrenaline sits inside of you deep

1509
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,040
in your tissue

1510
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,799
from 10 years ago from 20 years ago from

1511
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:29,040
eight years old from 10 years old

1512
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,880
from when you were 10 or 8 or 12 years

1513
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
old that adrenaline from

1514
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,680
fight or flight when you got that

1515
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,160
betrayal that trust that promise broke

1516
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,760
whatever it was what happens is or when

1517
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,119
you're in your 20s whatever that

1518
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:46,400
injury was right that adrenaline sits

1519
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,240
in your cells of your liver it sits down

1520
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,640
in there in your liver that's where the

1521
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,599
adrenaline sits in there

1522
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,160
sits in the liver and it sits in cells

1523
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,240
in your

1524
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,920
pancreas your spleen especially your

1525
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,640
liver and

1526
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,440
when you start eating healthy someday

1527
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,400
because you're getting

1528
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,079
sick and now you've got to eat healthy

1529
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,319
someday right

1530
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,319
and well i'm going to try medical medium

1531
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:12,480
or i'm going to try this other diet

1532
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,640
and the diet takes away the bagels and

1533
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,040
cream cheese the diet takes away

1534
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
the pizza it takes away these things

1535
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,160
right

1536
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,880
it takes away all this stuff all of a

1537
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,960
sudden

1538
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,160
those emotions are going to come out

1539
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,000
because that adrenaline

1540
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,359
is going to start coming out of old

1541
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,599
adrenaline

1542
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,799
with information of when you were hurt

1543
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,119
it's going to start

1544
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,160
leaching out of the of the liver and

1545
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,000
when it does

1546
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,319
you're going to be like oh my god i

1547
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,720
think i'm really i need this food right

1548
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,440

intuition maybe that's my

1553

information

1587
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,640
cravings and everything right and all of

1588
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,880
it but the point i'm trying to say

1589
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,480
is when our soul gets fractured and

1590
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,960
injured right

1591
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,720
that's the next piece of it you know

1592
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,200
soul memories

1593
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,280
soul injury to the emotional center of

1594
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,319
our brain and that's what happens too

1595
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,000
you get hurt right

1596
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:23,599
and then the emotional center of the

1597
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,160
brain is gonna get calloused

1598
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,359
you get hurt your brain heats up

1599
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,520
electricity

1600
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,880
hot wires in the brain every time

1601
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,440
someone

1602
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,640
betrays you or something happens

1603
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,480
emotionally

1604
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:42,319
your brain heats up like heats up

1605
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,079
hot and that heat fires and fires and if

1606
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,599
you're not eating enough glucose and not

1607
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,319
enough mineral salts

1608
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,079
and all that that adrenaline can fight

1609
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,720
literally scorch the brain

1610
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,319
every time someone hurts you and when

1611
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,839
you go too long without food like all

1612
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,520
the intermittent fasting people do and

1613
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,000
then they run into a crisis emotional

1614
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,680
crisis

1615
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,920
they don't got enough glucose for for

1616
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,160
their brain to cool it down

1617
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,839
because the glucose cools the brain down

1618
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,599
and in the emotional center of the brain

1619
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:09,200
you can have an injury

1620
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,760
right there in the emotional center of

1621
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,079
the brain physically but your soul can

1622
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,359
get

1623
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,319

the new edition golden heart brilliant

1646
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,160
my dad has bad r a he says potatoes make

1647
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,839
him sick

1648
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,039
and joints soar a question bar

1649
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:14,480
well aren't his joints sore anyway

1650
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:17,359
periodically

1651
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,799
without potatoes in his diet or all of

1652
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,880
his re goes away and then he eats a

1653
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:24,079
potato and the ra's back

1654
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,559
so be your have him be his own detective

1655
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:27,920
okay and is he eating his potatoes with

1656
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,280
sour cream cheese does he remember

1657
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,799
eating them with cheese sour cream

1658
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,160
butter and oil

1659
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:36,559
because potatoes help ra that's what

1660
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,680
helps ra because the epstein-barr virus

1661
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,960
causes ra and potatoes are antiviral

1662
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:46,480
see so are the potatoes eaten eat

1663
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,359
are they eaten with real cheese not this

1664
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,160
