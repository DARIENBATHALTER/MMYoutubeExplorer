an important one because this is a great

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,880
mystery like a really great mystery at

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,759
least you know what happens is with a

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,560
lot of autoimmune

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,000
diseases um different illnesses

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,119
different chronic illness the theories

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
they have are they're never the theories

47
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,680
are never right about any of the chronic

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,280
illnesses out there but at the same time

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,680
they at least can like hang their hat on

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,280
a theory that feels comfortable enough

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,920
for the medical community to be like

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,720
okay sure okay no that okay autoimmune

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
the body's attacking itself okay I'll

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,080
buy into that and that's not true by the

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,959
way that's not how it works the body

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,160
doesn't attack itself you guys know how

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,560
it works um who know me and know my

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,760
information and the truth that comes out

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,640
but the bottom line is is that when it

60
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,480
comes down to endometriosis it's not

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,120
even there's not even stuff there's not

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,080
even stuff to make people feel

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,440
comfortable as far as to clear up the

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,200
mystery there's not even information to

65
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,680
even help clear up the mystery to even a

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,319
point where everybody feels comfortable

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,120
in the medical communities even the

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,159
medical communities are like well they

69
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,239
just throw their hands up in the air

70
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,920
sure I mean we have procedures to

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,599
removing endometriosis when it gets

72
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,400
attached to the outside of the colon you

73
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,200
know we do surgical procedures and we go

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,879
in there and we we uh we we we lift off

75
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,760
the pods the tiny little cysts and we

76
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,519
try to we try to snip and clear out the

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,239
adhesions the best we can some really

78
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,480
good doctors know how to do this

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,000
procedure and um it's more successful I

80
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,920
think a little bit more successful now

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,440
for some people than it was in the past

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,280
and so it's it's you know that's helpful

83
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,840
it's that's been helpful for people and

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,360
then some people you know they've

85
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,120
they've not had a lot of luck with that

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
but still there's there's ways to deal

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,599
with it out there in the medical Realm

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,959
but that's just you know and then

89
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,480
there's not a lot though to offer about

90
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,400
why it even happens what even happens

91
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,799
why does

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,799
endometriosis occur why are these uh

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,680
endometrial cells attaching themselves

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
to the

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
bladder why are they attaching

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,280
themselves around the

97
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,480
ovaries why is this even occurring

98
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,120
that's the it's like a massive mystery

99
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,400
it's like meaning all chronic illness is

100
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,799
Mystery but at least in a lot of

101
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,159
different areas of chronic illness

102
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,840
everybody can get comfortable with

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,799
whatever lie or

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,760
scam or whatever it is in the medical

105
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,319
industry that they want to pass off

106
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,720
something you know some kind of thing

107
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,359
like first of all it was all in your

108
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,000
head years ago Oh no you're crazy it's

109
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,799
all in your head your symptoms aren't

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,120
even real so that that whole thing they

111
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,840
try to pass on everybody right and

112
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,160
everybody bought into that you know I

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,400
talk about that in thyroid healing and

114
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,800
then you know there's been one after

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,560
another one after another all the way up

116
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,240
to autoimmune now it's the gene Theory

117
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,639
everything's genes doesn't matter what

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,600
it is at this point it's like oh it's

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,960
your genes that's your that's just

120
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,680
you're going to have that disease cuz

121
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,080
it's genetic uh we might have a somewhat

122
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,600
of a treatment that can almost work but

123
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,960
it's it's or not but it's genetic you're

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
stuck with it it's just who you are

125
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
you're born this way you're faulty

126
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,600
that's that's the new way that one is

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
even kind of rising going to rise above

128
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,080
the autoimmune way they're both going to

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,000
be hand inand it's like it's genetic and

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,639
your body's attacking itself your body's

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,039
attacking itself because it's genetic

132
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,440
because you have a genetic disease and

133
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,720
your body's attacking it's going to go

134
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,840
back and forth like that or or both both

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,960
together like that that's how it's

136
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,199
always going to be and so and with

137
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,800
endometriosis they're trying to head

138
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,759
there they're trying to head there

139
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,319
they're going to have to they're going

140
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:21,840
to be like oh it's just genetic and

141
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,160
they're going to or NE immune cells are

142
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
confused or something like that we'll

143
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,720
cover some of their theories the medical

144
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,919
community's theories right now but it's

145
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,319
but the theories of endometriosis just

146
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,000
you can't even swallow it it's down it's

147
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,280
like it's hard to choke down because at

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
least some of the other theories for

149
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,440
chronic illness are they're ridiculous

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,919
and they're wrong but people can buy

151
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,680
into it easier with endometriosis it has

152
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,680
to be eventually pushed off to those

153
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,880
those theories too the ones that okay

154
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,319
it's genetic or the body's confused it's

155
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,759
going to have to go there because

156
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,600
they're just they just don't know how it

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,440
occurs it's it but it's like that with

158
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,800
chronic illness all over them you know

159
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,400
what I mean they don't know how really

160
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,120
anything occurs to this point and um

161
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,800
just how it's always

162
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,840
been so you know this show has nothing

163
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,639
to do with repackage or recycled Theory

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759
made to sound like a new understanding

165
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,680
of any kind of illness just for the

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,160
record the information here doesn't come

167
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,639
from medical interest groups medical

168
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,880
funding with strings attached Bots

169
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,319
research thumb on the scale you know

170
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,440
investors investing in a project so the

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,720
outcome has to has to be bias and and

172
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,160
fall into the Investor's liking because

173
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,280
they'll never invest again in that

174
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,199
person or that that that technician um

175
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,960
internal medical internal Kickbacks none

176
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,919
of that going on here no medical

177
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,680
lobbyists involved with any information

178
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,319
that's ever been on this show ever ever

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,720
ever ever that have been given out to

180
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,360
people to help them heal no persuaded

181
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,160
belief systems which is really dark

182
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,160
persuaded belief systems ends up make

183
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,520
making money go underneath the table so

184
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,000
that so that citations of studies and

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,479
per viws and all this other garbage and

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,759
junk science gets out there and then

187
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,160
that's why everybody's still sick and

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,280
chronically still sick and chronically

189
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,440
still sick because of all those

190
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,879
repackaged theories private panels of

different things because they're all not

done right because that's just a way it

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
works trendy traps from high fat diets

207
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,759
to you know diets that just don't make

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
sense when someone has a certain disease

209
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
or a certain problem and they eat a

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
certain way for but it's all for the

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,080
wrong it's all wrong because it's not

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,000
right for the disease or condition or

213
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,360
symptom they have all that trendy stuff

214
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
that gets M swirls around over and over

the the swirling bull that goes around

220
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,240

no answers because no one understands

225
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,479
how Epstein bar really truly works how

226
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,240
viruses really truly work how sibo is

227
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,800
really just the strep bacterium how all

228
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,080
these different things all how Lyme

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,120
disease is is oh my God just you got to

230
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,159
get the lime chapter you got to read the

231
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,640
lime chapter out of medical medium book

232
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,279
one I talk about lime a little bit in

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,719
thyroid healing but medical medium book

234
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,519
one I really lay it out and it's

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
Timeless it's classic even though that

236
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,959
was a couple years ago it's classic and

237
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,279
Timeless because it's it's it's what it

238
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,880
is it's the truth the truth is the truth

239
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,320
and the truth just stands there like

240
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,839
that and um it doesn't matter how many

241
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,560
genetic theories and autoimmune theories

242
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,640
of the body attacking itself and that

243
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,440
are wrong and and and and backward out

244
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,120
there so here's the

245
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680

uncontaminated place a clean clean

248
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,560
source of information I was given a gift

249
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,160
at age four I've dedicated my life in in

250
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,800

great lives all these years after being

255
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,720
debilitated debilitatingly sick with

256
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,519
chronic illness

257
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,440
with no hope and so um but anyway we're

258
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,000

patience at the beginning here I'm a

263
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,120
little bit more light-hearted in this

264
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,760
show I've been pretty heavy heavy heavy

265
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,440
duty in the other shows pretty intense I

266
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,160
mean pretty intense a little too

267
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,959
sarcastic little too intense because you

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,320
know what happens is when when you know

269
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,040
people are suffering out there and you

270
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,000
know information is is backwards it just

271
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,560
it just gets to you I'm sorry but it

272
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,800
gets to you after year after year after

273
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,880
year after year it gets to you because

it's like aren't we aren't we there yet

275
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,839
aren't we there yet what year is it

276
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,079
aren't we there I mean look at the

277
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,800
technology we have aren't we there don't

278
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,720
we have answers don't we have something

279
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,519
better than what's going on did you know

280
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,720
people are getting sicker and sicker and

281
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:32,519
sicker faster and younger unbelievable

282
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,920
able unbelievable Spirit was right when

283
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,680
Spirit told me that's what was coming

284
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:41,079
our way and spirit was 100% right of

285
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,079
course as always um so yeah yeah so that

286
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,120
so here's you know the endometrium in

287
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:48,320
the uterus the tissue lining there um

288
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,399
grows inside the grows it what happens

289
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,200
is those endometrial cells they they get

290
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,959
out somehow get outside of the uterus

291
00:10:52,200 --> 00:11:00,519
and they start to grow that's that's all

292
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:04,000
we know is somehow they get out side

293
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,399
they get outside the uterus so that's

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,720
that's what we know right there that's

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,200
basically it and it's it's not a lot

296
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,279
it's not a lot the cells meaning what we

297
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,040
know it's not a lot what we do for it

298
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,000
well you can you have some options the

299
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,279
doctors offer you could go on the

300
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
pill so that's one option they they they

301
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,480
try it's a try to to try to confuse

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,760
hormones because they believe the

303
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,760
hormones play a role with endometriosis

304
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:37,120
and um and they kind of do they kind of

305
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:39,560
do they do in some way they do and we'll

306
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,839
talk about that a little bit but all we

307
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,920
know really is that these endometrial

308
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,639
cells these endometrial cells somehow

309
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,600
get on the outside of the

310
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,680
uterus and then they

311
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,399
grow they grow they can grow in places

312
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,399
on the colon they can grow in places in

313
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
the pelvic walls they can get into the

314
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,360
pelvic Cav they can get into the the

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,959
ovar they can get onto the ovaries they

316
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,360
can get onto the

317
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:11,040
bladder what happens is with symptoms

318
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,560
that people have is that women have is

319
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,440
you know colon even though

320
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,720
that's actually not understood by

321
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
medical communities they don't really

322
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,720
understand that part but but

323
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,399
colon so lots of colon spasms can occur

324
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,360
so when these end endometrial cells are

325
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,680
actually on the outside of the colon and

326
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,760
they create

327
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,519
and little little um little pods and

328
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,000
little cysts and adhesions and micro

329
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,680
adhesions to larger adhesions to macro

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,480
adhesions are growing on the outside of

331
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,639
the

332
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,760
colon it's triggering off

333
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,920
nerves so then when uh you have your

334
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,399
menstrual

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
cycle then all of a sudden that happens

336
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,880
and all this pressure builds up and puts

337
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,160
pressure up against the colon and it

338
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,680
pushes those pods into the colon a

339
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,440
little bit it presses up against the

340
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
colon and then it touches nerves and

341
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,560
then colon spasms happen it's with a lot

342
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,000
of women when they're cramping they're

343
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,639
not just cramping from having a cycle a

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
lot of women with endometriosis they're

345
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,279
not just cramping from having a cycle so

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,920
you guys you probably many of you with

347
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,120
endometriosis probably experienced so

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,680
much like this and what happens is it's

349
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,440
also cramping from the colon

350
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,440
spasms and that's what makes it really

351
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,760
difficult

352
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,040
really difficult

353
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,519
because once these once these cells are

354
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,839
growing and these little tiny macro

355
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,639
adhesions and micro adhesions are are

356
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,160
developing and the cells are are kind of

357
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,800
prospering and and developing and and

358
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
and growing and that's happening on the

359
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,720
outside of the colon so the minute you

360
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,120
have your menstrual cycle and everything

361
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,320
swells everything swells and same with

362
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,399
ovulating every in during ovulation time

363
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,279
too everything swells ovaries swell they

364
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,839
expand so what happens is there pressure

365
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,959
there's not a lot of space in here

366
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,320
everybody thinks everybody thinks that

367
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,920
internally we have all the space they

368
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,519
all everybody does I honestly I've

369
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,800
noticed this even practitioners there's

370
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,199
the practitioners out there and

371
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,079
different healers and even some doctors

372
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,000
they they think there's a lot of space

373
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,079
in there not not everybody thinks this

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
but most everybody in your own body you

375
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,240
think there's a lot of

376
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,079
space there's no space in there

377
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,000
everything's squeezed everything's

378
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:34,240
already squeezed tight everything is

379
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,040
tightly squeezed everything the ovaries

380
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,399
are packed in there uterus everything is

381
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,920
packed in there everything's tight your

382
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,720
liver your gallbladder everything's

383
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,759
tight your intestinal tract your colon

384
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,040
it's all it's all tight connective

385
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:51,079
tissue all happening it's just all

386
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,720
packed tight and then what happens is

387
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,839
that all you need all you need is a few

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,279
things occurring so say you're a woman

389
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,160
and you have some lymphodema

390
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,560
and you're you have a little bit EMA

391
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,079
that means fluid retention so you're

392
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,680
dealing with some fluid and I'm not just

393
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,120
talking about weight or or extra weight

394
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,880
gain I'm talking about fluid retention

395
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,360
just a little bit of that happening

396
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,759
periodically and you have

397
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,759
endometriosis the fluid retention puts

398
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,279
pressure this isn't even a cycle or a

399
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,279
period a menstrual cycle I'm talking

400
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,600
about now fluid

401
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,079
retention it puts

402
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,480
pressure on everything in there there's

403
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,199
no place to go with that flu F retention

404
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,279
especially lymphatic system there's no

405
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,440
place to go so that pressure alone can

406
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
be uncomfortable when you're dealing

407
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,399
with endometriosis periodically make it

408
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,800
really

409
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,600
uncomfortable um the experiences could

410
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,600
be really uncomfortable if your bladder

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,759
gets too full so if your bladder gets if

412
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,639
you're holding in a a

413
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:54,959
pee if you're holding in a

414
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,920
pee and you know your kidneys got as

415
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,079
much PE as they can hold in and your

416
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,360
bladder you're holding that in with

417
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,040
everything you have and you got

418
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,279
endometriosis and the extra urine in the

419
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,759
bladder pushes you know kind of blows

420
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,000
the bladder up a little bit like a

421
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,959
balloon and it's got a little bit of

422
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,759
those pods or it has a little bit of the

423
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:17,519
intermetal cell sitting on outside the

424
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,240
bladder and they're all touching nerves

425
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,000
so the minute you have a little bit more

426
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,079
urine in your bladder oh my God it's

427
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,319
going to hurt it could burn it could

428
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:27,279
hurt it could be it could be painful you

429
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:29,319
can get bladder something

430
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,880
actually Medical communities are really

431
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,959
not too familiar with the

432
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,079
bladder so and you can get these bladder

433
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,160
spasms lots of these nerve related

434
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,680
bladder spasm so it's nerves triggering

435
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
off the bladder because the nerves are

436
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,120
sensitive because they got they got the

437
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,800
endometrial cells in the little pods

438
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,360
little micro adhesions macro adhesions

439
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,319
attach to the outside of the bladder so

440
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,759
then all of a sudden you're getting

441
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:54,079
these

442
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,319
spasms and that occurs and you know

443
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,000
every every woman is different because

444
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,279
they'll you know you could have a little

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,519
bit on the bladder you can have a little

446
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,199
bit on the colon you could have a little

447
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,720
bit around the ovaries you can have just

448
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:08,039
one spot a little bit around the

449
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,319
colon and nowhere else and you're

450
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,600
getting some colon spasms so when you

451
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,919
have your menstrual cycle and there's

452
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,799
all this pressure building up and

453
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,439
pressure building up from the menstrual

454
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:20,120
cycle it could put pressure up against

455
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,439
the colon morph because everything's so

456
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,400
packed tightly and then all of a sudden

457
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,240
it's pushing those little tiny cells

458
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,000
into nerves and when those get pushed

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,840
into nerves you're like oh my God you're

460
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,160
like this is a such an uncomfortable

461
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,440
menstrual cycle this is

462
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,039
brutal whether you're bleeding heavy or

463
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,280
not some women they're not bleeding

464
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,080
heavy and they're just they're just an

465
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,080
Agony and pain some women are bleeding

466
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,320
heavy and there're an Agony and pain too

467
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,520
so it's either or and then and then um

468
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,360
when those little nerves are being

469
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,080
touched by the pressure of a menstrual

470
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
cycle pushing up against the colon and

471
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,960
pushing against those pods and micro

472
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,440
adhesions and pushing them into the

473
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:01,000
colon then you got you got colon

474
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,880
occurring I mean I've seen it's some

475
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,039
women I mean that have called and

476
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,200
they're just like over the years and

477
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:08,000
they're just like they're like oh my God

478
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm on the floor or their husband would

479
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,400
call call me and just be like look I

480
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,200
need to they're on the floor they're

481
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,400
having you know this is what she goes

482
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,960
through all the time we have to do

483
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,400
something about and and you know and

484
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,880
that's that's what women go through when

485
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
they're dealing with

486
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,880
endometriosis and so we're going to talk

487
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,440
about what to do actually to help stop

488
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,679
endometriosis to stop it from growing

489
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
because that's what you wanted to do you

490
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,640
want it to stop it from growing you want

491
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,840
to shut it down and there are some great

492
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,360
things you can do to shut it down so

493
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,120
we're going to cover that and so when

494
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,400
people go into as colon you got

495
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,520
to put heat on their belly hot water

496
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,679
bottle up against their belly a moist

497
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,880
hot um towel anything like that that

498
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,520
does help get women through spasms when

499
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,440
they're going through that but it's no

500
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,000
it's no fun it's brutal I mean you guys

501
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,559
know you guys know how brutal it is and

502
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,039
same thing with urinary issues

503
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,200
with the bladder

504
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:09,080
too um and and that's also a real you

505
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,600
know that's a real hot spot real trigger

506
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,480
spot right there and then ovary pain

507
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
that's a whole another story so when you

508
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,240
have the the micro adhesions the macro

509
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,600
adhesions and you have the little pods

510
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,600
and you have the little cysts and you

511
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,120
have the little growths from endometrial

512
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,120
endometrial cells you have that going on

513
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,640
around the

514
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,120
ovaries and that's also really diff ult

515
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,120
too because you can get some serious

516
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,559
ovarian pain especially during ulation

517
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,280
and so forth so and everything's so

518
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,400
packed tight things are hitting

519
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,760
nerves why do you think the pain and the

520
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,799
spasms come because nerves actually are

521
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,720
the reason for pain and spasms because

522
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,240
the nerves are being touched or or

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,200
pushed upon or jabbed in one way or

524
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,640
another in order for that to happen and

525
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,159
that's how we get into that

526
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,520
place so endometriosis is such a mystery

527
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,799
to the medical world absolute mystery I

528
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,880
mean they use the pill to try to address

529
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,720
it to give people get get women some

530
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,520
results and relief but how does the pill

531
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,200
do that is it really blocking hormones

532
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,919
or altering hormones is it doing that in

533
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,039
order to give somebody relief what it is

534
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,000
doing is it's a steroid so all all

535
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,120
contraceptive that's that are like that

536
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,720
like the pill hormonal based

537
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,120
contraceptives they're all they're um

538
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,840
they're actually

539
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,240
steroids and what happens is with any

540
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,919
condition of the body doesn't mean

541
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,120
matter what it is whatever disease

542
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,480
illness symptom condition mystery

543
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,320
symptom whatever it is steroids are one

544
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:42,159
of these goto moments one of these go-to

545
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,600
situations for medical research and

546
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,600
science they have really not too many

547
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,559
options they got immunosuppressives for

548
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,280
people they got painkillers they got

549
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,039
steroids they got

550
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,120
antibiotics that's pretty much what's

551
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,880
going on in the medical industry there's

552
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,280
not much outside of that besides a few

553
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,120
blood blood thinners and if you you want

554
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,679
to go into anti-depressant land and and

555
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,880
um and antis psychotic drugs that's

556
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,200
another story but the point is there's

557
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,120
not many there's not there's a lot of

558
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,440
medications but not a lot

559
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,000
of options and small groups of

560
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,400
medication what I'm saying is you think

561
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,760
there's a lot more options you got

562
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,240
steroids you got antibiotics you got

563
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:25,200
immune suppressives immunosuppressives

564
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I mean it's a small group and you got

565
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,840
painkillers so research and science

566
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,320
doesn't have a magic magic pill and a

567
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,200
lot of women they don't they don't

568
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,760
respond to a steroid they don't respond

569
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,240
to the pill they don't respond to the

570
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:45,080
pill for their for for

571
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,360
endometriosis um some do where it eases

572
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,400
things and and many don't so it's hit or

573
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
miss

574
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,120
too when they do respond it's because

575
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,320
the steroid aspect of the pill is

576
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,520
suppressing the the inflammation part of

577
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,480
the issue so you get inflammation so

578
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,000
what happens is endometrial

579
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,320
cells um when they're clinging when

580
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,799
they're on the outside of the uterus and

581
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,960
they're in the pelvic cavity and they're

582
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,320
in areas and they're they're they're on

583
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,760
or they're on the outside of the colon

584
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,720
or they're up against the bladder they

585
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,919
create in they're they're kind of

586
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,240
creating

587
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,200
inflammation but they're not really

588
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,200
creating inflammation themselves these

589
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,640
little endometrial cells something else

590
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,120
is and we're about to talk about that in

591
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,799
a little bit so inflammation is is being

592
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,200
is created around the situation I'm

593
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,720
going to talk about that and clear that

594
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,640
up a little bit so you know what's going

595
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,960
on there and so what's happening is when

596
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,880
you take the pill which is a variety of

597
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,080
steroid it's a type of

598
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,520
steroid what happens is that you get

599
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,080
some suppression of it that's that's

600
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,880
what goes on um women with uh severe

601
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,039
severe severe endometriosis they

602
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,240
actually sometimes put them on not just

603
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,360
the pill but they put them mon

604
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,840
additional

605
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,039
steroids periodically to try to get to

606
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,400
try to get everything to calm

607
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,600
down so but there's there's not a lot of

608
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,960
options so there's not a lot of things

609
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,200
going on there in the medical world and

610
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,360
it's still a complete mystery to

611
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,480
research in science but there's ways to

612
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,960
actually stop it there's ways to

613
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,120
diminish it there's ways to to push it

614
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,799
back and we can do that naturally

615
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,640
through Foods we can do that naturally

616
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:29,720
through certain supplements so we're

617
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,600
going to go into

618
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,960
those

619
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,720
so we've covered a lot with what's

620
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,039
happening here and then the symptoms are

621
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,679
really you you get the painful periods

622
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,600
the you get also when you're going to

623
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
the bathroom the bowel movements can be

624
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,720
really really

625
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,000
difficult so when elimination is

626
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,600
occurring that's difficult because when

627
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,760
you have peristaltic action on the

628
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,720
colon and the col's twisting it's it's

629
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,120
it's squeezing and the peristaltic

630
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,039
actions happening and it's got got the

631
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,240
little pods and the little microions on

632
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,360
the outside of the

633
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,279
colon um tickling the nerves and it's

634
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,360
it's

635
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,480
twisting or squeezing I'm sorry

636
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,039
peristaltic action occurring where the

637
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,520
the Colon's actually getting messages

638
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:17,559
from nerves to actually move so that

639
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,240
your elimination can come out of you

640
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,840
okay and end up in the toilet when

641
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,799
that's happening you could be really in

642
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,440
a lot of pain a lot of

643
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:30,120
pain from that and that's one of the

644
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,039
things so many women go through and it

645
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,200
gets confused it get gets confusing um

646
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,679
and there's a lot of times you can go to

647
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,360
10 doctors and one doctor be like I

648
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,240
don't know what this is uh I think you

649
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
just got IBS another doctor be like I I

650
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,960
don't know what's going on and then you

651
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,720
get some women that have a little bit of

652
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,799
IBS and they have endometriosis or they

653
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,039
have endometriosis but it's not causing

654
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,480
the problem and what they really have is

655
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,399
something happening in the intestinal

656
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,240
tract it's there's so the it's really

657
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:01,200
difficult out there it's so not

658
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,159
clear-cut and it's not easy and it

659
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,720
should be that's the hard part about

660
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,640
chronic illness and everything that I

661
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,200
deal with you wonder why I get annarchy

662
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,000
and you wonder why I get sarcastic and

663
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,760
you wonder why I talk about how the

664
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,320
information here is different than the

665
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,039
the Recycled Theory that's out there

666
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,200
there's a reason why I talk about all

667
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:20,720
that because it should be

668
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,000
easier we shouldn't have to go through

669
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,720
this I've seen a lot of women and young

670
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,520
women have to go to doctor and doctor to

671
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,440
doctor I've heard their stories out

672
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,240
there there and they've had to they the

673
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,159
different answers everywhere one

674
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,159
doctor's like oh no it's really this one

675
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,600
doctor's like oh it's that we think you

676
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,039
have endometriosis we're going to have

677
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,320
to do this and this to do this and

678
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,760
meanwhile no that's not even what's

679
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,440
causing the pain or the problem or the

680
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,880
discomfort and no and you got this and

681
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
then it's it's

682
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,640
endless and maybe it's just candida and

683
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,960
you got chronic yeast infections we

684
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,600
can't tell yet we're going to figure

685
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,880
this out and it's just a lots of tests a

686
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,320
lot of different confusion and then you

687
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,120
get blood work and you're you know

688
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,760
you're going to another specialist and

689
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,679
yet then you you know you leave with

690
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,559
some kind of pres prescription or you

691
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
leave with a pill if you're not already

692
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,919
on it and then regardless of all that

693
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,440
you're still not doing good A year later

694
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,120
then you end up getting fatigued nobody

695
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
talks about that you get the fatigue and

696
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,799
now you're tired and now you don't feel

697
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,000
good and you're getting migraines and

698
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,320
it's it's all that going on you know

699
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,600
with young women having to deal with

700
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,039
that and and and older women having to

701
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,840
deal with

702
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:29,360
that it's really really difficult it

703
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,000
shouldn't have to be that way in this

704
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,240
day and age we shouldn't have to be

705
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,760
there we just shouldn't have to be there

706
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,039
when you really think about

707
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,559
it so there's a lot of theories out

708
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,640
there let's talk about the theories for

709
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,640
a couple of

710
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,039
minutes so science and research they

711
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,360
don't know how they they don't know how

712
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,159
endometriosis occurs they don't know

713
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,320
what happens they they got some guesses

714
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,120
so they've done a lot of round T guesses

715
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,399
and had a lot of people talking and to

716
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,960
figure out what you know a lot of the

717
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:02,440
time Top Doctors in the world and and um

718
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,880
and big Pharma and everything they've

719
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,840
gotten together and they've they've come

720
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,399
along with you know science and research

721
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,240
come along with a few

722
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:14,880
theories um so one is called something

723
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:17,440
like the uh um the um let's see there's

724
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,000
different the perianal theory so what

725
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,200
this means is the inner abdomen the

726
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,080
inner side of the abdomen cells line the

727
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,320
inner side of the abdomen because the

728
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,279
immune system creates this problem it's

729
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,080
really or its hormones the immune system

730
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,679
create the problem so you got you got

731
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,120
endometrial cells that are lining the

732
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
inside of the

733
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,000
abdomen so it's like the perianal theory

734
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,080
so that's one um it really doesn't make

735
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,039
a lot of sense so then there's the

736
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,120
retrograde Theory so it's called

737
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,960
retrograde that's another theory out

738
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,200
there and you know and and look I'm not

739
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,559
an expert on the

740
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,880
theories that are out there I'm not an

741
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,880
expert on the bogus theories so don't

742
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,039
you know don't quote me on the exact

743
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,240
bogus Theory

744
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:03,640
thing um I'm an expert at the truth and

745
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,640
the information that you need and the

746
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,200
truth of what causes whatever you know

747
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,640
whatever disease illness and and

748
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,120
everything that's where I'm an expert at

749
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
of course and I say that because luckily

750
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,720
I got spirit and that's why I'm an

751
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,600
expert I wouldn't be without spirit so

752
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,440
it's not me being smart I'm not a smart

753
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,720
guy okay I never went to school it's

754
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,480
because of spirit so the bottom line is

755
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,440
these theories that are out there um

756
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,480
they there're they're to swallow so the

757
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,760
retrograde Theory that's when you're

758
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,440
having a menstrual cycle so menstruation

759
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,880
is occurring and blood throws back up

760
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:40,720
through the Fallopian tubes into the

761
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,960
pelvic cavity spreading cells I I like

762
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,399
that theory you know I I I like it a

763
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,240
little bit because you know it's

764
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:53,760
it's it's reasonable it's a reasonable

765
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,480
Theory so that's one there it is

766
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,120
reasonable um anyway another theory

767
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,799
science and research has it's embryonic

768
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,279
cell transformation I think that's what

769
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,000
they call it uh if my memory serves me

770
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
right I mean you can look up these

771
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,799
theories out there and look this up

772
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
you'll you you know you could probably

773
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,640
read as much information as you want on

774
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,600
it and this has to do with uh ental cell

775
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,960
implants so it's it's all about estrogen

776
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,320
and and ental cell implants and you can

777
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,880
read into that one um so that you know

778
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,880
these are still all theories another

779
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,960
theory is C-section or surgery so when a

780
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,399
woman gets C-section or gets a

781
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,279
surgery that endometrial cells they tend

782
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,360
to find their way into the incisions

783
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,600
into the scar into the incisions or

784
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,320
where the surgery where the injury was

785
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,320
and the endometrial cells tend to get in

786
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,080
there and they spread and grow it's a

787
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,279
believable Theory it's kind of

788
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,159
believable that's one

789
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,960
too and then there's um there's another

790
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,720
theory it's uh cell

791
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,240
transport I like this one probably the

792
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
best out of all the theories out there

793
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,240
in the medical communities or the

794
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,559
medical science and research World

795
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:11,360
endometrial cell transport this is when

796
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:13,320
lymph your lymphatic system transports

797
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,360
cells to other areas of the body

798
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,679
intermetal cells to the other area of

799
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,600
the

800
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,880
body so look the bottom line is an alien

801
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,720
isn't coming out from outer

802
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,440
space and taking endometrial cells and

803
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,679
taking those endometrial cells and

804
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,480
placing them around the body so there

805
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,200
has to be a way they have to get around

806
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,760
the body there has to be a way you know

807
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,720
an alien's not coming out of the sky and

808
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,440
doing it

809
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,360
so all right we won't be talking that

810
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,760
silly um so so that's another theory too

811
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,960
and then there's another theory the

812
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,720
immune system disorder which it's always

813
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,120
going to go here and Lead here like

814
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,240
meaning in the sense that this this is

815
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,760
the theory it's always going to land on

816
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,279
which is your immune system is attacking

817
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,039
itself your body is distorted you you

818
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,760
know what I mean your body's Twisted

819
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,080
it's it's it's attacking itself it

820
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,480
doesn't know what's right or what's

821
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,960
wrong it doesn't know what's up and down

822
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,039
this is the autoimmune Theory so it

823
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,760
always goes in there the body can't

824
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,559
recognize and destroy the endometrial

825
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,039
cells so what's happening is these

826
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,200
endometrial cells are getting on the

827
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,159
outside of the uterus and they're

828
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,200
finding their way into the pelvic cavity

829
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:18,600
and your body isn't recognizing them to

830
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,279
destroy

831
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,960
them so they're just growing it's kind

832
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,880
of a little bit of the backwards a

833
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,240
backwards rendition of autoimmune

834
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
disease

835
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,200
disease but it's still in the same

836
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,000
category where they're putting it where

837
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,679
your body's creating this it's an immune

838
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,279
system

839
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,720
disorder and your body can't recognize

840
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,559
and Destroy these endometrial

841
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,120
cells so that's where that one is that's

842
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,960
a theory too all on its own so I'm just

843
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,399
running some of the

844
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,080
theories of modern medicine but no

845
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:54,360
matter how you slice the pie no matter

846
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,320
how you slice the cake or whatever you

847
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,000
want to do um the the the bottom line is

848
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,000
my medical science researchers saying we

849
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,200
don't know how these cells get on the

850
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,360
outside of the uterus we don't know how

851
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,720
they get there they just do they just

852
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,559
do that's the bottom line so there's a

853
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,320
couple things that happen with there's a

854
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,799
couple things so let's go into um let's

855
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,960
go into the nitty-gritty let's go into

856
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,919
the deep stuff let's go into The Real

857
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,279
McCoy let's go into the the real deal

858
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,840
okay of what's really going on and

859
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,320
what's happening with endometriosis with

860
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,799
a couple things one thing you have to

861
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,799
understand here is endometrial cells

862
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,919
have a life to them like no other they

863
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:43,440
have a life to them like no

864
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,519
other so we're dealing with the uterus

865
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,840
here we're dealing with the maker of

866
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,679
Life someone might argue and say well

867
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,440
the egg is the maker of life before it

868
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,480
even gets into the uterus so you're

869
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,480
wrong Anthony someone else might say

870
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,799
well the ovaries are the maker of life

871
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,559
so you're definitely wrong there

872
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:03,240
well no no no no no no the uterus you

873
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,760
can have all the eggs you

874
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,399
want and you can have the you know your

875
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:14,440
your ovaries can be perfect but the

876
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:17,679
uterus has to keep life sustained for

877
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,799
those nine months the uterus has to keep

878
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,880
life

879
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:27,679
sustained so precious

880
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,679
life a living being has to be sustained

881
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,320
and

882
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,679
protected and in good

883
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,799
standing more than good standing

884
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,960
protected a little Angelic being inside

885
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,000
the

886
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:48,440
uterus and a little baby and so the

887
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:51,919
uterus is a a really fierce fierce

888
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,120
fierce protector of life that's what the

889
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,039
uterus is and the metrial cells are

890
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,320
programmed with information tremendous

891
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,360
amounts of

892
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,840
information I mean honestly the

893
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,919
information in one endometrial

894
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,679
cell would probably explode a computer a

895
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:14,200
computer's database would just overwhelm

896
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,040
it override it I'm not I'm not computer

897
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,359
savvy or anything I'm not a big I'm not

898
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,240
a big tech savvy person but you get the

899
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:26,119
drift of what I'm trying to

900
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,839
say the information literally if it was

901
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:35,000
somehow DEC coded or somehow downloaded

902
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:37,639
from one endometrial cell it would have

903
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,440
centuries and centuries and centuries

904
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:43,480
and thousands of

905
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,280
years of information within it from the

906
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,200
human species alone and how life

907
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,679
sustains itself and how life is

908
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,879
protected within the uterus and

909
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,079
everything around

910
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:57,640
it so the will for an endometrial cell

911
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,280
to survive

912
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,880
is

913
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,720
great is great it's

914
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,280
great and so that's something just to to

915
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,720
realize and just consider of what you're

916
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,040
dealing with like if you don't know what

917
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,359
you're dealing with then you're going to

918
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
underestimate it you don't know what

919
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,720
you're dealing with then you're going to

920
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,920
call the wrong shots if you don't know

921
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,480
what you're dealing with then you're not

922
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,520
going to know what causes what and what

923
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,400
disease what

924
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,320
illness if you don't know what you're

925
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,560
dealing with like they don't know what

926
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,119
they're still dealing with with Lyme

927
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,079
disease out there I'm sorry to say that

928
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,480
if that confuses you get my lime chap

929
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,760
from book one just read it if you don't

930
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,200
know what you're dealing

931
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,599
with that's not good that's where we go

932
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,920
wrong right at the beginning if we don't

933
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,520
even know what we're dealing with if we

934
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,040
don't understand the uterus and we don't

935
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,680
know what we're dealing with to a degree

936
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,680
with the uterus or any kind of cells

937
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
uterus based or any kind of endometrial

938
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,800
cells if we don't know what we're

939
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,720
dealing with here and I'm saying that

940
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,839
over and over again because it's that

941
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,480
intense then we don't know where we

942
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,160
really

943
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:04,520
stand we don't know where we really

944
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:08,440
stand we don't we

945
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:13,079
don't what happens is the uterus a

946
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,920
uterus has to be clean it has to be

947
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,599
clean what does that mean what does that

948
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,200
mean you have your menstrual cycle it's

949
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,520
cleaning itself out preparing itself to

950
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,640
sustain life but it has to be clean

951
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,599
clean from what clean from poisons and

952
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:33,680
Clean from toxins clean from poisons

953
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,640
clean from toxins clean from pathogens

954
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,480
clean from viruses clean from bacteria

955
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,359
clean from heavy metals clean from to

956
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:46,800
from poisons and toxins clean from

957
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,319
troublemakers clean from all of those

958
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,400
troublemakers

959
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:52,000
clean what does that mean why am I

960
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,599
saying that over and over again I'm

961
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,680
saying it over and over

962
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:06,240
again because what happens is that the

963
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:10,640
endometrial cells are used used to leave

964
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:14,200
the uterus with a poison or a toxin in

965
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,200
it to keep the uterus

966
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,000
clean that's what's going on how do they

967
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,079
get out of the uterus we'll talk about

968
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,880
that in a couple

969
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,000
seconds but the point is is that they're

970
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,720
carrying something the uterus does not

971
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,240
want those cells inside the

972
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,800
uterus that's how this is

973
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,720
done so those endometrial those

974
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,200
endometrial cells if they were studied

975
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,640
with the right kind of science we're

976
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,359
just not there yet we don't have science

977
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,800
that could study much of anything we're

978
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,680
playing around with genes and that's all

979
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,680
fun and dandy and it's all because

980
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,119
they're they're interested in cloning so

981
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,760
they want they wanted all this money

982
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,839
going into genes and genes and then

983
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
they'll tell you that genes are the

984
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,880
reason why we're sick so more money

985
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,440
against dumped into it more money more

986
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,920
investing gets dumped into it but

987
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,200
meanwhile they're not working on any of

988
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,839
that what they're working on is just

989
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,119
more cloning more cloning more cloning

990
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,599
they want to clone monkeys they want to

991
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,720
clone humans they want to clone it's

992
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,200
just cloning it's a sick sick sick

993
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,079
cloning game that's being that's being

994
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,480
built without anybody's permission or

995
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,599
anybody knowing about it just so you

996
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,560
know that's why they throw the gene

997
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,880
Theory at us all the time it's so we we

998
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,640
we have everybody everybody becomes a

999
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,160
pawn meaning meaning experts become a

1000
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,280
pawn um wealthy people become a pawn and

1001
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,640
they dump more and more money into the

1002
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,079
factory of genes so so they can say

1003
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,680
they're working on our mysteries of

1004
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,240
healing Us in chronic illness but what

1005
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,599
they're really doing it's you're just

1006
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
sitting there privately working on

1007
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,720
trying to clone and clone and clone and

1008
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,240
clone and do other Sinister things and

1009
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,880
devious things but science and research

1010
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,920
really doesn't do anything about

1011
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,119
anything else so when you have these

1012
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,400
endometrial

1013
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:52,359
cells and these endometrial cells

1014
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,960
they're literally packed with not only

1015
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:55,760
information and a will to survive and a

1016
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,359
will to live but they're harboring a

1017
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,920
poison and a toxin they've been kicked

1018
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,680
out of the

1019
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,760
uterus they've been kicked

1020
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,520
out and they've been kicked out they

1021
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,040
they're not just kicked out during

1022
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,960
menstrual cycles that's not enough they

1023
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,960
get kicked out in between it

1024
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,720
all they get pushed out endometrial

1025
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:24,240
cells get pushed out through the lining

1026
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,160
of the uterus a process that that no one

1027
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,000
knows now what I liked about was one of

1028
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,599
the theories that they have which I I

1029
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,760
actually I actually thought it was a

1030
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,520
cool

1031
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,800
Theory um it was when the floian tubes

1032
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,720
it went backwards it was the retrograde

1033
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,720
menstrual cycle where your cycle the the

1034
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,880
you know blood actually pushed up with

1035
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,040
cells in it backwards up through the

1036
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,839
fallopian tube and out into the pelvic

1037
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,480
cavity I did like that theory a

1038
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:57,599
lot it's not quite accurate a another

1039
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,839
miraculous Theory

1040
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,280
but it's not quite accurate I I I like

1041
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,000
it and I say I like it because it's it's

1042
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,119
really cool and it's is it

1043
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,640
possible you know what it it it's

1044
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,280
possible that blood can go through there

1045
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,359
I've asked spirit and spirit says yeah

1046
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,119
blood could go up it up the fallopian

1047
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,480
tube but what's really happening and

1048
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,079
that's rare situations by the way what's

1049
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,359
really happening and because

1050
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,160
endometriosis is not rare it's

1051
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,000
common cells are actually being pushed

1052
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,359
through the lining of the

1053
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
uterus that's what's

1054
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,040
happening and you can't you can't see it

1055
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,280
or record it or or understand it because

1056
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,280
unless you live inside of a human

1057
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,359
being's body unless you live inside of a

1058
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,119
woman's body and live in there which you

1059
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:54,560
can't you'll never see the process the

1060
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:56,079
process is just impossible to understand

1061
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,119
but cells are pushed through the walls

1062
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,920
of the of the uterus these are cells

1063
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,400
that have poison in them that have to

1064
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,800
leave the

1065
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,079
uterus a lot of women have tremendous

1066
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,000
amounts of heavy metals in them lots of

1067
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,359
mercury lead aluminum arsenic cadmium

1068
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
nickel

1069
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,599
barium I I don't know more more than

1070
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,400
that copper and and even more than that

1071
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,760
and these toxic heavy metals are just

1072
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,359
one thing but that's not why these

1073
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,200
that's not why these cells are being

1074
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,359
pushed through the uterus and out the

1075
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,359
other

1076
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:34,280
way these cells are being pushed through

1077
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,760
because they're loaded with pesticides

1078
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,960
herbicides fungicides redenti sites

1079
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,720
larvicides they're loaded with all the

1080
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,160
neuro antagonists and all the dangerous

1081
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,240
chemicals that are actually Within These

1082
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,560
they're loaded with um um dangerous

1083
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,359
chemicals that are in colognes and

1084
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,640
perfumes and

1085
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:56,480
hairspray they're loaded with these

1086
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,359
cells get loaded with everything thing

1087
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,880
that we not only inherit through a

1088
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,640
family line like

1089
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,440
DDT so we inherit DDT we get that from

1090
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,680
our family line not only Mercury from

1091
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,400
our family line not only those poisons

1092
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,520
we get a lot more poisons than that

1093
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,440
every single day we're

1094
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,680
here nanotechnology Finds Its way inside

1095
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,720
the uterus all the time so

1096
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,920
nanotechnology actually Finds Its way in

1097
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,599
the uterus and that's on everything we

1098
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,000
have today and then there's poisons in

1099
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,520
foods and then there's Pharmaceuticals

1100
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,559
too and all the pharmaceutical poison

1101
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,599
that we inherit that we inherit it that

1102
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,240
we have in our system from our

1103
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,520
forefathers for mothers and then we

1104
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,160
already have them and then we bring in

1105
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,240
more pharmaceutical poison and more

1106
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,160
pharmaceutical poison and then on top of

1107
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,200
that I mean it's endless all the way to

1108
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,520
air

1109
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,400
fresheners all the way to air

1110
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,599
fresheners it's everything it's poison

1111
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,000
from Every Avenue

1112
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,640
solvents I mean that are on everything

1113
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
that you that we don't even know about

1114
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,720
carpet cleaning chemicals it's that's

1115
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,760
just some these are just some of the

1116
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,880
exposure we get pesticides herbicides

1117
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,160
fungicides especially fungicides are on

1118
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,839
everything they're on clothing

1119
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,599
fungicides are all over New clothing con

1120
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,559
just all over New clo clothing and they

1121
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,599
find their way these these these poisons

1122
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:23,400
get in deep into the uterus and the

1123
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,319
uterus is the life protector it has to

1124
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,760
do everything it can to get rid of these

1125
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:33,160
poisons so so it literally launches a

1126
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,599
campaign a direction it launches it La

1127
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,839
launches an

1128
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:41,440
operation to excrete poisons using

1129
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,280
endometrial cells the reason why science

1130
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,760
and research has never going to tap into

1131
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,800
this ever touch upon it or ever do

1132
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,599
anything about it is because it will

1133
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,160
then

1134
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,800
showcase all the poisons they'll have to

1135
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,160
do profiles on these poisons they'll

1136
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,960
have to take an endometrial cell and

1137
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,599
they'll have to do a Prof profile on the

1138
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
poison and they're they're going to find

1139
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,440
everything in there they're going to

1140
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,440
find every every chemical from Every

1141
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,680
chemical Factory that should be shut

1142
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,119
down that literally should be shut down

1143
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,160
trillions and trillions and trillions

1144
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,720
and trillions of dollars in lawsuits

1145
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,160
hundreds of trillions of dollars in

1146
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,079
lawsuits because I mean because these

1147
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,079
these chemicals that are in women's

1148
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:19,720
bodies I mean just imagine what would be

1149
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,319
where that would go if that was all

1150
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,119
discovered and all profiled and science

1151
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:24,760
of research decided to make a database

1152
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,319
of what's in every cell they don't they

1153
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,559
won't they don't want to know any of no

1154
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,520
one wants to know anything no one not

1155
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,680
wants to know anything in the

1156
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,119
industries so the uterus sends these

1157
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,839
cells

1158
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,200
out pushes these cells out these cells

1159
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:41,800
have a life

1160
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,359
force and they're really really tiny

1161
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,000
these cells start out so tiny but they

1162
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,079
harbor not only tremendous amounts of

1163
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,559
information of life life force and

1164
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,240
needing to grow and needing to live

1165
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,720
because they get that information

1166
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,160
automatically from years and years of I

1167
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,119
mean from being for years and years of

1168
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,920
being in human history of a woman's

1169
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,200
human being in history and in life force

1170
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,720
to create life but from the uterus and

1171
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,680
then to Harbor that information and have

1172
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,200
that information to to to grow and to

1173
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,240
become is is yeah is part of it but they

1174
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,240
do need to be triggered in order to do

1175
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,960
that too so not only they they filled

1176
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,680
with poison but the endometrial cells

1177
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,800
are not supposed to be triggered into

1178
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,240
growing into pods and adhesions micro

1179
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,520
adhesions macro adhesions insists all

1180
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,760
through the pelvic cavity pelvic wall on

1181
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,400
top of the bladder on top of the colon

1182
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,400
they're not supposed to do

1183
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,720
that they're not but they're filled with

1184
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,240
a poison that pathogens love to feed off

1185
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,640
of they're filled with a poison that

1186
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,559
pathogens love to feed off of and there

1187
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:49,400
are plenty pathogens to be had in the

1188
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,680
pelvic wall in the pelvic region in the

1189
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,480
pelvic cavity there's pathogens to be

1190
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,680
had with a lot of women have a lot of

1191
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,599
pathogens in certain areas and they are

1192
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,280
in the lymphatic vessels they are on the

1193
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:01,680
outside of the colon these pathogens

1194
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,160
they are on the inside of the colon

1195
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,720
these pathogens they are on the inside

1196
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,960
of the bladder they are on the outside

1197
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,319
of the bladder these pathogens are

1198
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,000
available they're there they're

1199
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:17,400
around and when any kind of pathogen

1200
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,720
feeds off of an intermetal cell it's

1201
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,200
it's like it's like a a

1202
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,880
bonafied package it's like a Christmas

1203
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,480
present of poisons and toxins because

1204
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,960
the uterus needs to eliminate that

1205
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,200
poison and toxin with everything it has

1206
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,880
so that a being can be free from it

1207
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,599
inside the uterus even though sometimes

1208
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,839
the beings in the uterus may not be free

1209
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:43,079
from it because there's so much poison

1210
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:47,280
and toxin inherited or there in general

1211
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:49,720
or be or are are coming in on every

1212
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,240
level and so you have these intermal

1213
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,280
cells that are not supposed to be

1214
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,800
growing and they're not they're supposed

1215
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,680
to be pushed out and

1216
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,040
discarded

1217
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,720
but they end up becoming also food for

1218
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,000
pathogens so that's one thing that

1219
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:08,480
occurs because a pod can only grow and a

1220
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,760
micro adhesion a ma macro adhesion and a

1221
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,359
cyst can only grow from a pathogen

1222
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,720
feeding off of a cell a certain human

1223
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,839
cell well the endometrial cell is a food

1224
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:23,960
for a pathogen which will then grow a

1225
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:26,200
cyst a pod a macro adhesion a micro

1226
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,920
adhesion so with women with

1227
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,359
endometriosis we have to keep pathogen

1228
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,599
levels down we have to keep bacterial

1229
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:37,200
and viral pathogens down any of these

1230
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:40,319
pathogens any of the viral and bacterial

1231
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,640
pathogens can can feed off of poisons in

1232
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,160
these endometrial cells that could

1233
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,040
kicked out of the uterus pushed out of

1234
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,440
the

1235
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:50,119
uterus and um and and so this is really

1236
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,400
important to understand and so what do

1237
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,800
we need to do about it and that's the

1238
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,200
whole next thing we have to talk about

1239
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,480
right now is what do we need to do about

1240
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,880
it so what do we do

1241
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,200
first of all we got to deal with Foods

1242
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,520
foods are critical you got to think

1243
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,079
about foods and what I recommend with

1244
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,720
anybody with severe

1245
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,880
endometriosis is to go 100% plant-based

1246
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,160
for a little while in their life it

1247
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,000
doesn't mean they have to be like that

1248
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,680
forever if they don't want to but it

1249
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,559
would go plant-based for a little bit

1250
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,599
little bit it's just it's just it's like

1251
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,160
if someone says well hey you know it's

1252
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,760
like when your doctor says hey take this

1253
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,640
medication for a little bit and then

1254
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,119
we'll see we'll take you off of it it

1255
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,880
doesn't mean that doctor is so Pro

1256
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,160
medication or whatever it doesn't and

1257
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,119
whatever it's just what's right for the

1258
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,000
moment the doctor

1259
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,000
believes and in the case of

1260
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,400
endometriosis What Spirit believes is

1261
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,440
you really really need to be plant-based

1262
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,839
and that's something to consider stay

1263
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,079
away from the most of the grains is what

1264
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,760
is what's important when you're dealing

1265
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:49,040
with endometriosis stay away from most

1266
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,000
of the grains be grainfree and and even

1267
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,720
consider the 28 day cleanse in medical

1268
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,440
medium book one and take a look at that

1269
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,880
and consider the 28 day cleanse even if

1270
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,440
you do that for a little while and see

1271
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,799
where your menstrual cycles are see

1272
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,119
what's going on and then see what your

1273
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:04,240
doctor's reports are as every every few

1274
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:05,839
months when you're getting ultrasounds

1275
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,720
or getting a CAT scan or however your

1276
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,000
doctor deals with taking a look and

1277
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,280
seeing what's what's going on with your

1278
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,119
endometriosis um so Foods no dairy

1279
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,079
products it feeds it feeds the very

1280
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:22,240
pathogens any pathogen can take

1281
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,160
advantage of an endometrial endometrial

1282
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,480
cell that's filled with loaded loaded

1283
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,720
with toxins so you have to take Foods

1284
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,880
because Foods literally um will feed any

1285
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,680
pathogen to begin with and you want to

1286
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,200
get rid of all pathogens and any

1287
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,839
possibility of pathogens you want to get

1288
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,440
away Dairy you want to get away from

1289
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,319
dairy that's milk cheese butter you want

1290
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,119
to get away from eggs 100% away from

1291
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:44,839
eggs you want to even keep the meats out

1292
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,720
like I said before no Meats no chicken

1293
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:47,799
no turkey you want to go back to that

1294
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,319
down the road you can probably go back

1295
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:51,760
to that down the road but you want to

1296
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,880
really really go plant-based and see how

1297
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,799
you feel and see where you are in the

1298
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:59,880
moment but foods are critical no corn no

1299
00:49:56,799 --> 00:50:01,960
you know no pork no corn no canola

1300
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,000
canola tends to aggravate the heck out

1301
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,960
of endometriosis is meaning like it

1302
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,720
makes it prosper and grow so be really

1303
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,839
cautious with that that's important no

1304
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,400
soy with endometriosis that's another

1305
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:16,480
thing too so canola soy got to be

1306
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,920
careful there okay and and making sure

1307
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,000
there's you know you you want to stay

1308
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,720
away from processed foods for sure but

1309
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,880
you got to be careful overall with

1310
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,760
whatever you're doing with Foods no

1311
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,400
gluten and just try to be great rain

1312
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,599
free for a while I would be working on a

1313
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,480
lot of sweet potatoes sweet potatoes for

1314
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,160
dinner every single night I would be

1315
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,720
doing the heavy metal detox smoothie in

1316
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,559
the morning I'd be doing the celery

1317
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,760
juice in the morning heavy metal detox

1318
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,880
smoothie in the morning I'd be doing um

1319
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,160
lots of snacks like apples and celery

1320
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,079
dates Apple celery all through the day

1321
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,440
lunchtime I'd have an avocado and a

1322
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,599
salad of spinach um that's what I would

1323
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,200
do there salad of spinach tomatoes

1324
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,839
cucumbers avocados at night you know at

1325
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,920
night for dinner I would be doing um

1326
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:59,480
sweet potato Poes and a salad a whole

1327
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,119
bunch of sweet potatoes and a salad and

1328
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,440
not a lot of dressing on a salad you

1329
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,119
could probably get away with maybe um

1330
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,880
you squeeze lemon squeeze limes on the

1331
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,599
salad maybe a teaspoon of olive oil on

1332
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,319
the salad you can throw a few hemp seeds

1333
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,960
in the salad that can work too maybe a

1334
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:17,000
little of avocado you don't want your

1335
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,720
fats too high but this would be a

1336
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,280
perfect diet you could also do winter

1337
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,160
squash at the end of the day too but

1338
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,960
sweet potatoes really important I would

1339
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,880
I would lean on the sweet potatoes and

1340
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,319
try to live off of those practice so

1341
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,319
instead of doing chicken or turkey at

1342
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:31,960
night for dinner I would lean on those

1343
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,760
sweet potatoes it would be so the

1344
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,640
morning celery juice then it would be

1345
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,280
heavy metal detox smoothie okay look

1346
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:39,680
into that to figure it out you to know

1347
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,839
which one how that works from there I

1348
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,400
would go to more snacks from lunchtime

1349
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,280
avocado and a salad that would be

1350
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,240
perfectly fine spinach different lettuce

1351
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,799
tomatoes and cucumbers in the afternoon

1352
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,680
dates celery sticks apples at night time

1353
00:51:49,799 --> 00:51:53,440
dinner time lots of sweet potatoes and a

1354
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,119
salad again I would stay plant-based

1355
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,880
while you have endometriosis that's one

1356
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,359
D diet that I would do with

1357
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,000
endometriosis and you're going to start

1358
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:01,920
seeing results the other thing is lots

1359
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,680
and lots of lemon balm High dosages I

1360
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,160
would do like two three cups of lemon

1361
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,480
balm tea a day I would do two I would

1362
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,040
mix equal parts you know like like I

1363
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,359
would do Cups of Tea where i' have two

1364
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:16,720
lemon balm bags of tea two bags in one

1365
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:18,559
cup two bags of of nettle Leaf you know

1366
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,079
with that one would be like literally

1367
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,400
four bags of tea basically here's what

1368
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,160
you need to do make a big jug big jug of

1369
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,200
tea and put a lot of leaf and a lot of

1370
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,119
lemon balm in it and drink that

1371
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,280
periodically through the day you can

1372
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,960
even switch that off with raspberry leaf

1373
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,000
like on another day and just do Straight

1374
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,839
raspberry leaf on that day this is this

1375
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,359
is what really gets the endometrial

1376
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:45,119
cells to also clean house see here's the

1377
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,280
thing when you have these endometrial

1378
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,480
cells and they're filled with poisons

1379
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,079
and toxins and they've been kicked out

1380
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,599
of the uterus for a very good reason and

1381
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:52,040
they're sitting on the outside anywhere

1382
00:52:50,599 --> 00:52:53,920
in the pelvic cavity and all around the

1383
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,640
bladder or anywhere it is that they're

1384
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,280
finding their way you want to clean

1385
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,079
those up too you want to clean the

1386
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,880
poisons out of those intermetal cells

1387
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,280
when you clean the poisons out of there

1388
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,400
pathogens won't even care they won't

1389
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,319
even feed off of those poisons to create

1390
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,359
a cyst or create a tumor or create

1391
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:12,920
anything going on inside the pelvic wall

1392
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:15,319
or or anywhere on the bladder or the

1393
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,240
colon okay so other supplements getting

1394
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:18,680
your zinc reserves is good you know get

1395
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,920
find the right zinc on the directory if

1396
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,839
you need to that's important if you look

1397
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,160
at the heavy metal detox smoothly you'll

1398
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,799
see it's got the spear lean The Barley

1399
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,960
crass look at the right ones to get on

1400
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:31,160
my directory uh on medical medium black

1401
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,319
kohos can be an herb you can you can

1402
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,839
play with you can talk to your

1403
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,119
practitioner and doctor about black

1404
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,359
black cohos it could be helpful

1405
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,920
sometimes depending on if you're on

1406
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,319
medications or not you can talk to your

1407
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:44,799
doctor practitioner and vitamin C I

1408
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:46,440
would consider vitamin C2 and b12 so

1409
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:48,400
those are the supplements I would bring

1410
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,839
in and those are the teas I would bring

1411
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,799
in and I would do lots of parsley lots

1412
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:56,240
of cilantro in your salads if you can um

1413
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:58,079
consider that you can juice parsley with

1414
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,720
celery if you really had to or juice it

1415
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,760
with cucumber and celery throw an apple

1416
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,799
in there in between it all these are the

1417
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,640
things I would do focus on the foods I'd

1418
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:08,119
focus on that kind of diet I would focus

1419
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,200
on these kinds of supplements and then

1420
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,640
what's going to happen is the heavy

1421
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,760
metal detox movie is going to start

1422
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,960
removing heavy metals from the outside

1423
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,760
of the uterus too and from the inside of

1424
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,559
the uterus and from everywhere else it's

1425
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,160
also going to removing other poisons and

1426
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,240
toxins that are in these entr

1427
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,599
endometrial cells so that they don't

1428
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:28,559
become food and fodder for pathogen that

1429
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,400
are in everyone pathogens that are in

1430
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,240
everyone in everybody's liver and going

1431
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,559
into the repr reproductive system and

1432
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,640
I'm talking about all the HH uh vs to

1433
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:39,839
epine bar to all the streps in different

1434
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,599
groups of strep to all the other groups

1435
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,799
of bacteria that would that could be

1436
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,240
harboring and that are naturally in

1437
00:54:43,799 --> 00:54:49,680
people and you have to understand that

1438
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:51,760
these pathogens love to feed off of food

1439
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,640
that's poison and toxin when you start

1440
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,400
clearing this up and cleaning this up

1441
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,240
your your uterus won't be kicking out as

1442
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,640
many endometrial cells to begin with

1443
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,640
they won't even grow when they're on the

1444
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,200
outside they won't be triggered by

1445
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,319
viruses and your immune system will get

1446
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,359
stronger and things will be in the right

1447
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,760
place I love you guys that's the

1448
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:10,640
direction we got to go take one day at a

1449
