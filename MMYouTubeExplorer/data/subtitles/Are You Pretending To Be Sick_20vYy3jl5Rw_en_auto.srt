what happens is i've seen this i've seen

240
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,680
a spouse

other condition or autoimmune that's

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,839
that's debilitating in some way like

245
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,760
keeping them down right and then so

246
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599

265
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
that happens all the time

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
all the time lemon balm love danielle

267
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
says you just want the attention that's

268
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
another one i've heard over and over

269
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
again

270
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,279
i know michelle l says try harder

271
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
and

272
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:25,120
exactly you just want attention you're

273
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
an attention seeker how about that one

274
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
you're a whiner

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,839
how about that one okay how about that

276
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,519
one guanalupe says i love the juicer too

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,480
you know and that's the thing that's the

278
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,800
challenge right and that that you know

279
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,880
that takes the person who's suffering

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,120
and struggling it takes them spiritually

281
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,279
so much further though than anybody else

282
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,959
because you spiritually grow because not

283
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
only are you struggling with what you're

284
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,600
up against

285
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
physically

286
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,839
right

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,880
what you're up against you're also

288
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,720
struggling with all this you get

289
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,560
you're struggling with all the crap you

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,519
get i mean what the heck

291
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,959
it's unbelievable how much crap we get

292
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,040
right

293
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,839
eileen says doctors don't believe you

294
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,600
either and that's a whole nother level

295
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
of it all doctors don't believe

296
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,320
anyone either when they're struggling

297
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,160
and suffering and you can't identify it

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,560
like you can't like you can't see it

299
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,720
but the new age is taking it to a new

300
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
level because you've created it

301
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,560
i want to be sick i want to be bedridden

302
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,519
i want to be on mattress island i'm

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,680
creating it i must be using my thoughts

304
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
to take myself down that's one part of

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
the new age that you know focuses on

306
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,399
that you see it everywhere out there

307
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,839
lacey says my counselor said to fake it

308
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,839
till i make it

309
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
you know i think

310
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,680
and it's not funny but that's actually

311
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,839
that's actually a good one because i

312
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
don't think i've heard that one

313
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
i don't

314
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,959
ken says i was down but i'm better than

315
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,040
ever after doing celery juice thank god

316
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,880
thank god you're doing so thank god you

317
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,600

thank god you're doing you're doing that

319
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
thank god you're taking care of yourself

320
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
right

321
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
and you found the information

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
okay

323
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,959
you know michelle elliot says yes i get

324
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,040
lots i get tons of attention in my bed

325
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,440
laugh out loud alone

326
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,160
exactly and that's another angle people

327
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,720
who are struggling with chronic illness

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,920
people with that are struggling

329
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,360
with chronic illness

330
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,440
they don't get the attention everybody

331
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,640
thinks they get

332
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,720
even the young people i can't tell you

333
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,800
how many moms and dads i've talked to

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,760
over the years because doctors would be

335
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,160
like look um the parents they have sick

336
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
kids i need advice so i talk to the

337
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
doctor and say here here here's you know

338
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
this is this is what what i think can

339
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,880
help you to help your patients and

340
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,920
and it would be the same thing over and

341
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,720
over again where even young people

342
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,600
it gets kind of canceled out because

343
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,680
it's like is it the boy who cried wolf

344
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
is that what it is is this the boy who

345
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,600
cried wolf

346
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,000
and they start getting numb to it so

347
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
everybody around everybody gets numb to

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
it

349
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
young adults the same thing it's like

350
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
the parents if they're lucky enough to

351
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,240
have you know parents that are

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,399
supportive and all that right then all

353
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,040
of a sudden it's like um

354
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,360
yeah we don't know what's wrong with you

355
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
you've been to a lot of doctors already

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,480
you say you have this anxiety condition

357
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,399
you say you have fatigue but is it

358
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
really what it is honey like is it

359
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
really what it is

360
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,720
and everybody gets doubted it so the

361
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
chronic illness thing game is like

362
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,200
everybody gets down and alicia says

363
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
women always told they're faking it for

364
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
centuries now

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,760

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
tonight

392
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560

it's just fun

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
but look the bottom line is you guys

396
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,000
you're not making it up

397
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,920
you don't have a fear of healing

398
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
i know

399
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
you don't

400
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,079
have a fear of healing andrea says we

401
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,760
prefer attention more than our health

402
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,160
yeah right like that's that's what you

403
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,920
want exactly you prefer just getting

404
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,240
attention been being forced to lay in

405
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,000
bed because your condition's keeping you

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,519
on the couch it's keeping you in bed

407
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,120
you're on a mattress couch island you

408
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
can't function good you can't get into a

409
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,680
car you're struggling you're suffering

410
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,680
you'd prefer attention better than than

411
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
just being stuck right not being able to

412
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,600
live the life to where you want to live

413
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,199
it right now at your fullest optimum

414
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,199
possibilities

415
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,360
deborah says or your family is just

416
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,519
pretending you're fine and they

417
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
completely ignore you

418
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,240
and you are isolated alone that's a big

419
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,680
one i've seen that too i've seen that

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,639
for so many times over the years i do

421
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
i think

422
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
what happens is the reason why medical

423
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
medium has always talked about this and

424
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,600
this information medical medium and

425
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,480
spirit of compassion has always told me

426
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
to be wise about this like understand it

427
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199
and

428
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,920
and understand what people are going

429
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,360
through right and i i think that i've

430
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,079
always done that i've gotten a lot of

431
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,320
crap for it though for a lot of reasons

432
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,920
cara says then you get the medical gas

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,680
lighting the medical gas lighting is a

434
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,760
whole other angle so think about that

435
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
think about how many obstacles you get

436
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,880
when you're a sick person right when

437
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,480
you're somebody suffering with a mystery

438
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,959
illness or a chronic illness just think

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,480
about how many obstacles it's like land

440
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,639
mines you're like okay you're cruising

441
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560

for it you're fighting for your life and

444
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,079
then boom the doctor gaslights you and

445
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,440
tells you okay this and this and they go

446
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,639

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
for your life you're fighting for your

to you do need a psychiatrist try that

451
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839

453
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,079
and now you're fighting for it and

454
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
you're cruising along and now you get

455
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,519
sick now you got the autoimmunes getting

456
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
worse no one understands and all of a

457
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,399

with any of it now you're fighting for

462
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,680

another and it just keeps on going

464
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,320
and it keeps on going and then the

465
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,240
invisible illness part is so hard

466
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
it's so hard when it's an invisible

467
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,839
illness

468
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,800
neil rimmer says

469
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,639

yeah

640
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
are dogs creating it with their thoughts

641
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
because i want to know i was scratching

642
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,919
my head the other day

643
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,679
when i heard

644
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,440
somebody i know that i haven't talked to

645
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,120
in years that reached out

646
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,799
and said

647
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,960
that somebody told them they were

648
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,159
creating their sickness

649
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,840
right

650
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,240
in the same conversation they told me

651
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,679
they took their dog to the vet the other

652
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,200
day because their dog was sick

653
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,760
so i said

654
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,280
did they tell your dog that your dog's

655
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,120
creating his illness too

656
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,600
that's what i asked

657
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
and the person was like what

658
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,880
what do you mean

659
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,720
i said

660
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
did the dog create

661
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,919
the sickness or was the dog lazy

662
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,240
was the dog a liar

663
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,480
was the dog lying

664
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,159
was the dog making it up

665
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,720
was a dog

666
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,760
trying to get attention so the dog was

667
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,559
faking being sick

668
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,400
was the dog creating it with the dog's

669
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,760
thoughts

670
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,200
so he said he said poopoo would never do

671
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,039

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
pupu would never make that up

676
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,360
poopoo would never do any of those

677
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,200
things

678
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,679

it's insane

684
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,880
what i've noticed here on planet earth

685
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,360
is the most craziest crap can happen

686
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,240
and we just have to live in it

687
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,240
the most unsensible stuff can happen

688
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,799
that makes no sense at all there's all

689
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,840
these spiritualists now most spiritual

690
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,760

you hear that all the time out there

707
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,240

715
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,159
thoughts

716
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,120
does a four-year-old

717
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,200
create being really sick

718
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,520
no a four-year-old an eight-year-old a

719
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,080
ten-year-old wants to be playing

720
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,840
wants to be living their life doesn't

721
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,559
want to be suffering from any kind of

722
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,279
condition and either does any adult

723
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,240
nobody ever wants to be sick or down in

724
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,799
out

725
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,080
nobody wants a cold

726
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,840
even though there aren't no colds

727
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,000
anymore and i said that to you guys many

728
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,799
times

729
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,880
the flu is the only thing that was out

730
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,559
until the recent plague

731
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,679
right and the recent plague brought

732
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,720
about brought about the flu family a flu

733
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,440
family

734
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,919
line right but the point is is there was

735
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
there aren't no colds anymore but do you

736
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,880
want a cold i've seen people say you

737
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,720
just wanted this cold right now you

738
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,080
needed some down time to do some healing

739
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,080
so your body took on the cold purposely

740
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,000
your body took on the flu purposely

741

but also

800
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,799

in this whole you're creating it with

849
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,919

the most incredible pieces of of just

854
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,360
trickery is

855
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,200
you're creating it and manifesting it

856
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,760
you're the one you're you're the reason

857
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,320
why you're sick emotionally mental

858
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,559
physical all of it it's because of you

859
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,120
you can't master your your thoughts

860
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,279
you're creating it you're weak you have

861
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,919
to rewire you have to learn all the

862
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,520
spiritual tricks to try to you know to

863
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,080
get to superseats overpower everything

864
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,039
empower yourself and correct yourself

865
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,799
right

866
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,799
to say it's all you and you're screwing

867
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,520
up but then they'll say at the same time

868
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,799
you're perfect everybody's perfect

869
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,440
how you are you're perfect who you are

870
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,440
don't change anything

871
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
love yourself you just need to love

872
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,960
yourself you're perfect

873
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,799
but at the same time you'll flip it in

874
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
the same sentence but you're screwed up

875
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,279
so you better work on it

876
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,279

877
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,120

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
butt kicked

927
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,559
that is definitely not accurate i can

928
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
promise you that it's definitely not

929
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,279
accurate you can say hey anthony you got

930
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,279
your opinion i got mine i believe i

931
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,080
deserve this karma i believe i have this

932
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,399
karma and that's why i'm suffering aw i

933
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,720
get it you have your opinion we don't

934
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,480
always have to listen to aw you know of

935
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,320
course not you don't have to listen to

936
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,000
me on any level but i can promise you

937
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,080
this it isn't because of something bad

938
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,039
you did in a past life or two lifetimes

939
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,200
ago that's not why you're suffering

940
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,159
the reason why

941
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,840
the industries love when people

942
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,200
scramble for answers and pick on

943
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,080
themselves i have a fear of healing it's

944
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,880
my fault i created it it hides what's

945
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,240
really making everybody sick

946
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,080
it hides

947
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,559
the caffeine addictions which just

948
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,600
slowly just ages people and tears them

949
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,960
down it hides right it hides that it

950
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,559
hides

951
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,960
the injuries from the pharmaceuticals

952
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,320
it hides that it hides the toxic heavy

953
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,720
metals

954
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,720
it hides the chemical warfare placed

955
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,679
upon us every single day it hides the

956
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,120
radiation exposure upon us when we go

957
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,960
through the airports

958
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,480
people you know how people are worried

959
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,840
about cat scans they're like whoa it's a

960
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,519
lot of radiation it is a lot of

961
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,960
radiation but if your doctor tells you

962
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
have to get a cat skin of course go get

963
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,240
a cat scan but you know people are

964
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,240
really worried about cat scans being a

965
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,399
lot of radiation right this is a good

966
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,640
thing to talk about right now

967
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,480
you get a cat scan when you go through

968
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,480
that airport

969
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,399
we get a cat scan

970
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,159
you get 400 chest x-rays when you walk

971
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,520
through that airport all you got to be

972
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,879
doing

973
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,159
is walking past that baggage going in

974
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,560
right there

975
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
going in that radiation machine that

976
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,119
unregulated insane amounts of radiation

977
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,399
streaming out of that thing and then

978
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,800
you're taking your baggage and the

979
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,480
things glowing in the dark

980
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,480
and then you put your clothes on after

981
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,079
you that were in that baggage and you

982
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,839
put them on and you put basically a

983
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,359
radiation blanket all over your whole

984
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,960
body you're getting by the time you're

985
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,919
done with that whole trip you just had a

986
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,280
cat scan or two

987
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,159
there's all these other reasons why

988
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,159
everybody's sick

989
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,839
