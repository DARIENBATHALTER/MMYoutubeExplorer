little bit about your healing

58
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:12,520
Journey well I've been chronically ill

59
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,959
for a long time even when I was a child

60
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,360
I had something called valley fever I

61
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,120
lived in the California um Valley and I

62
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,000
contracted it a couple times so I had

63
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,039
weak lungs and I also had weak joints

64
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,919
and I was never diagnosed with really

65
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,640
anything else than that growing up and

66
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,720
and probably my symptoms didn't really

67
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,640
start to be um really noticeable until

68
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
after I had kids and I started getting

69
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,480
really a bad chronic fatigue um I

70
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,000
started having few concussions from

71
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,320
accidents throughout my life and my

72
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,360
neuro fatigue was really really bad

73
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,720
where I'd had trouble with my short-term

74
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,320
memory and I wouldn't you know you walk

75
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,200
across the room and you're like what am

76
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,600
I doing over here and then I could never

77
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,640
remember I forget people's names and I

78
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,520
was young at the time and I just was

79
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,840
able to cover it enough where people

80
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,559
didn't really notice it cuz a lot of us

81
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,960
with chronic fatigue become um good

82
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:13,480
actors and actresses to not disclose

83
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,200
what's going on um but later in life I

84
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:21,440
was um had Peri I had trouble with my

85
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,320
periods my menstrual cycle um depression

86
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,559
and it wasn't until I got diagnosed with

87
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,520
Mero limes disease I started to really

88
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,120
look into maybe Chang My Lifestyle with

89
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,520
food I started changing different little

90
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,559
things at a time like eliminating gluten

91
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,919
eliminating Dairy and all those things

92
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,280
helped a little but it wasn't really

93
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,080
until I found the medical medium

94
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,840
information in 2018 on a social media

95
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,360
post and it talked about celery and I

96
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,520
thought wow I've tried hundreds of other

97
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
things and spent an enormous amount of

98
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,720
money on those things and did not get

99
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,760
any better and maybe some things even

100
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:02,280
made me worse so I decided to try celery

101
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,559
juice and I really was a dabbler at the

102
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,600
beginning cuz I didn't have the um

103
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:11,280
capacity to read the books at that point

104
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,159
or nor listen to it on Audible so I

105
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,799
would just look up like an encyclopedia

106
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:19,320
certain symptoms I was having and and

107
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,480
and do those protocols and little by

108
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,400
little I just it happened so quickly

109
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,240
symptoms were dropping um my allergies

110
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,280
went away my lifelong allergies I had a

111
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,760
nickel allergy I talked about

112
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,000
last night actually that went away so I

113
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,440
got my energy back I was able to work

114
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,159
out again my hair was I was losing hair

115
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,000
in my temples my hair grew back my

116
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,080
eyelashes grew back so just like these

117
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
little things started happening but it

118
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,840
wasn't until a little bit later till I

119
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,440
got deeper into the protocols that the

120
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,480
bigger symptoms went away like the

121
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,679
chronic fatigue and the um The Chronic

122
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,640
joint pain excuse me that I was

123
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,840
suffering with I used to be able to

124
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,440
drive without um with Braes on my arms

125
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,280
like this opening the refrigerator with

126
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,960
a

127
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,159
towel having my kids lift the pots up on

128
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,200
the pan up on the stove so all these

129
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,559
protocols using food and healing healing

130
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,960
food and herbs have really created a new

131
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,799
life for me can you talk about a little

132
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,919
bit about the first protocols that you

133
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,320
brought in where you really saw those

134
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,679
changes especially with the joint pain I

135
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,080
brought in a lot of protocols but it

136
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,080
really wasn't until you eliminate those

137
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,159
those brain betrayer Foods especially

138
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,840
like canola oil so I I really did spent

139
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,240
a lot of time in the kitchen PR prepping

140
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,760
my food and bringing my food with me so

141
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,600
that was really important to stay on

142
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,760
track and not not deviate with the no

143
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,960
Foods I also suffered from a caffeine

144
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,120
addiction from chocolate I was a really

145
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,679
big chocolate addict so eliminating that

146
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,320
addiction and the need for caffeine was

147
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,960
really helpful too did you feel that the

148
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,720
more that you fueled your body with

149
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,400
those nourishing foods and the protocols

150
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,600
he recommended

151
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,000
recommends it stopped those cravings for

152
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,720
the chocolate and things like that in

153
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the brain in the Brain book he talks

154
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,520
about the brain shots so and he has a

155
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,240
craving shifter shot that's amazing so I

156
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,200
did a lot of those I did a lot of brain

157
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,640
shots and those are very

158
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,440

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,480
that over and over again for uh

192
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,480
motivation and just it helped them on

193
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,120
their healing journey by hearing that

194
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,600
that person had used these methods to

195
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,200
heal and it's just incredible right oh

196
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,799
yeah it's incredible cuz your body does

197
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,880
want to

198
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:51,200
heal it does can you share an example of

199
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,360
a specific memory of how your life was

200
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,799
impacted from those uh health issues you

201
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,080
were dealing with prior to Medical

202
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,799
medium information well I couldn't be

203
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,320
active

204
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:06,679
so I couldn't I did a lot of laying down

205
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,000
and resting resting my nerves um I was

206
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,880
able to do enough to raise children and

207
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,480
have it not be really noticeable that I

208
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,279
was really had chronic fatigue but in

209
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,720
the interim I would just rest a lot so I

210
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,799
think just being active and being

211
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,039
outside I'm able to get out in nature

212
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,000
more and Anthony actually told me last

213
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,279
night to get out of nature more but um

214
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,320
which I love hiking and walking my dog

215
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:33,320
so all those things have helped me be

216
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,720
more active I do Pilates I play golf now

217
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,640
I play pickle ball and I would never

218
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,919
dream of be able to do any of those

219
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,840
things prior do you have a new

220
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,480
appreciation on being able to do those

221
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,360
things after everything you've gone

222
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,120
through absolutely because I try to have

223
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,000
fun at those activities and not be

224
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,520
competitive and want to win I'm just

225
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,159
there to have fun because I know what

226
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,520
it's like if I can't participate in

227
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,960
those it's not fun at all so I try to

228
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,960
have appreciation for the things I'm

229
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,720
able to do now that's beautiful

230
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,919
yeah yeah what was it that made you want

231
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,080

slow um in my healing Journey it's been

257
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,760
years um and you just slowly start

258
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,200
adding the protocols one by one and and

259
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,760
use prayer and meditation in the Angels

260
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,760

261
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,720

266
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,600
those meditations over and over these

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:03,679
going down onwards because of some

372
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:07,519
addictions and and I was I you know you

373
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:13,200
you named the uh the the methods I've

374
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:16,360
tried all of them uh nutrition uh yoga

375
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,600
all of it uh I've tried it and I've read

376
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,039
many many books like everybody does and

377
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,519
Anthony mentions that a lot there's a

378
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,360
journey that we all go through and then

379
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:31,960
we we try different things and we go see

380
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,519
different doctors naturopath osteopath

381
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,320
Al theath we we try all of them and we

382
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,000
spend Fortune doing all of that and I

383
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:43,440
was also trying to not not only healing

384
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,600
myself but healing uh one of my sisters

385
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,039
that was uh that was uh whose he was

386
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,159
declining and she had no help uh really

387
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:58,000
from the medical community so uh I was

388
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,799
trying also to to help her and uh I some

389
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,639
naturopath mentioned that book I mean

390
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,559
she funny enough she didn't really

391
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:08,720
follow it but she mentioned it uh so but

392
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,000
I learned it was you know it was a man

393
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
talking to a spirit so I didn't want to

394
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,399
read that type of book

395
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:21,279
again for another you know for the ex

396
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,679
number of time so I you know I didn't I

397
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,760
didn't follow up on it but I happened to

398
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,240
see an interview with Anthony on

399
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,120
Entertainment Tonight I believe it was

400
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:36,480
MH and uh that's what hooked me because

401
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,919
what he said was um made sense made made

402
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,480
a lot of sense to me and then I I got

403
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:45,000
his first book and I read it and made a

404
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,000
lot of sense from what I had gone

405
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,039
through for what my sister had gone

406
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,440
through uh and

407
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,679
observing uh people around me uh from

408
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,480
far or from AF far from a closer uh what

409
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,760
they what their journey in into uh

410
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:06,799
disease is it made a lot of sense to

411
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,360
me um so uh I started celery juice and

412
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:15,159
it's hard the first the first few years

413
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:18,799
because you you have to to uh change

414
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:21,159
everything um I mean I was lucky because

415
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,360
already I was uh dairy free and

416
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,000
glutenfree but you know you fall off the

417
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,440
wagon you you get depressed and then you

418
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
you know there's always this back and

419
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,639
forth going on and uh watching his

420
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,120
videos and reading the books uh helped

421
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:40,600
me get get on track and um and

422
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,919
uh you know it was hard at first also

423
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,080
because you're sick and I was sick so

424
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,519
you're very tired and you're depressed

425
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,200
and uh brain fog you're

426
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,159
confused uh you have all these symptoms

427
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,600
I had menopause symptoms I had chronic

428
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,480
sinusitis uh you know I would go to the

429
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,720
emergency uh not being able to breathe

430
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,159
either you know it it was accumulating a

431
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,039
lot so you it's it's hard to go through

432
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,639
that and then and still uh hold on to

433
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,799
any method really but I held on to that

434
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,880
one because it was working it was really

435
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,159
helping and it felt very fresh and the

436
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,200
the um all the explanation about it

437
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,679
sounded very uh made a lot of sense to

438
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,600
me so unfortunately I couldn't help my

439
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,320
sister she passed away

440
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,080

00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,120
you

442
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,840
so I kept going it's still hard to think

443
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,840
about

444
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,840
her

445
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,480
so what was hard just to see her go and

446
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,039
I wish I could have helped

447
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:57,559
her better and I've

448
00:33:52,039 --> 00:34:00,760
known medical medium before but you know

449
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:03,559
like life is such that the way things

450
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,559
happen it happened that way so but so I

451
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:10,200

796
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:19,240
incorporate even pieces of the

797
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,839

800
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,119

that I think when one person heals they

806
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,480
pass on the message and pass on the

807
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,280

808
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,520

809
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,599
course they they need to be open and

810
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:51,000
receptive so it's always I wait for the

811
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:53,480
cues and if I'm feeling it's the right

812
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,680

you came across the medical medium

862
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,599
information yeah so I um I was I got

863
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:54,920
severely constipated that was my first

864
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:58,000
symptom right for a long time it took me

865
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,680
I I just tried to everything and and

866
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,720
finally I became a colon therapist right

867
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:05,280
and then you know we were seeing a lot

868
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,040
of this was about 14 years ago and one

869
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,960
of the um one of the other therapists we

870
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,640
were seeing a lot of lime patients com

871
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,799
in at that like lime clients coming in

872
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,920
at that time and um one of the Bri one

873
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:21,680
of the other therapists sent me a um the

874
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,200
goop article that the first goop article

875
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,079
on lime and my jaw just kind of dropped

876
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,880
and and so so I just I I thought okay

877
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,040
I'm going to try this celery juice so I

878
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,319
bought it every day for like a week and

879
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,839
I I just couldn't believe that I was

880
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:40,720
like what cell re juice who would have

881
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:43,839
guessed who would have known that like

882
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,040
it just started working and I was just

883
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:49,520
like couldn't believe it wow and so then

884
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,960
I got the first book came out and I

885
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,920
start because I other I had other

886
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,440
symptoms that had come upon up after the

887
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,960
you know I had the constipation for a

888
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,079
long time but then I fatigue hit me and

889
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:03,319
then the brain fog and I I would come

890
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:05,480
home and crash you know I'd only be able

891
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:07,040
to do the basics which thank God I you

892
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,640

fatigue I guess my head would feel heavy

896
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,599
like a bowling ball and I couldn't think

897
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,160
straight and I couldn't remember my

well actually I had

1017
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:10,160

about 19 I mean 2015 oh and then we

1019

suffering wait I don't like the word

1037
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,839
suffering I'm going to say I have been

1038
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,400
challenged by

1039
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:58,119
PTSD for a little over seven years and

1040
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,799

1051
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,839

1052
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,440
ends

1053
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:40,839

1054
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,160

going to say

1056
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:47,359
that anyway so um but I hadn't been able

1057
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,640
to sleep and I've been having panic

1058
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:51,440
attacks and and my adrenal glands are

1059
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,559
waking me up in the middle of the night

1060
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,799
and shooting out adrenaline and then I'm

1061
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:58,440
so wak up I never was sleeping and we

1062
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,839
were all my friend Karen and I were

1063
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,599
already buddies but you know I was

1064
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:04,200
telling her about that and she goes well

1065
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,960
have you done the celery juice thing and

1066
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:08,400
I I said well no I really haven't and so

1067
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,240
she said okay well I'm going to start

1068
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,039
making you celery juice for a while and

1069
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:18,000
then and then um the heavy metal

1070
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:20,079
smoothies and then and then we'll um see

1071
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,920
how you like that and before that like I

1072
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,839
was like already going to get celery

1073
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,160
juice before before she made it for me

1074
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:30,319
cuz I couldn't wait and I was doing it

1075
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:33,160
every day and gradually I okay this is

1076
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,839
the biggest thing you know I I I slept 5

1077
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:39,599
hours at a time once I hadn't done that

1078
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:42,119
in over seven years and um now see my

1079
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:44,520
mind freezes so that's one of the things

1080
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:48,839
that's actually it was better until my

1081
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:53,440
dad died so I'm a little bit but um okay

1082
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:56,160
so um I also was able to fall asleep

1083
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,359
without listening to something because

1084
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,240
when I don't listen I think about what

1085
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:03,039
happened but now I can just close my

1086
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,319
eyes and go to sleep

1087
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:08,000
peacefully I'm a little bit I'm a little

1088
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:10,000
bit discombobulated from the current

1089
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,680

blast and just tell our story how we got

1165
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,680
here my mom is the one that actually

1166
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:17,799
helped me find the medical medium and it

1167
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:21,200
started about um 2 3 years ago after the

1168
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:24,039
post-pandemic uh covid shots and she

1169
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,279
developed like a bloating feeling

1170
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:29,119
discomfort and she

1171
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:32,319
we took her to several doctors even the

1172
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,839
several uh primary physicians to get a

1173
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,279
second opinion and the second doctor

1174
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:39,000
told us

1175
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:41,760
like she said we don't know what your

1176
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,119
symptom is or you're diagnosed or can

1177
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,839
anything to help you but if you find

1178
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:49,440
with the answer come back and see me and

1179
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:53,599
I was like okay so I started researching

1180
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:57,240
online and then I found a a psychiatrist

1181
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,760
on the one of the online events and she

1182
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:03,200
said something with it's maybe cuz we

1183
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:05,520
tested her for every like um the colons

1184
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,000
and everything and nothing was like

1185
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,799
everything was normal so she was still

1186
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,880
belching and had the bloating feeling on

1187
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:15,359
and off it goes up and down so finally

1188
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,480
um I found an online lady that said that

1189
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:21,279
it's could be related to anxiety and

1190
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,640
causes like a a tightness in the air and

1191
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:26,160
breathing and everything so then I still

1192
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:30,160
was researching about anxiety and I came

1193
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,000
up on a medical medium on Facebook with

1194
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,520
one of the I I've seen it before but I

1195
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,920
never really looked into it because I

1196
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,839
always see the flashes and finally I did

1197
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:41,400
a research and I didn't even know he had

1198
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:44,079
like a uh what is it called all these

1199
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,200
books and podcasts and even their own

1200
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:50,200
website so as I started more research I

1201
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,559
found deeper into understanding it and I

1202
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:56,400
started putting my mom on the celery

1203
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:59,480
juice and and also um the lemon water

1204
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,400
and the morning cleanse and after that

1205
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:05,559
she started healing with her belching

1206
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,000
stopped and then her also anxiety and

1207
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:11,680
depression started to

1208
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:15,599
fade yeah and then we were here last uh

1209
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:17,920
summer during the Culver City so we had

1210
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:22,000
the blast and after that it jump started

1211
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:24,279
me into um giving me a boost into I did

1212
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,960
the 28 day cleanse right after I got

1213
01:06:24,279 --> 01:06:28,680
back for some reason it just like

1214
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:31,520
brought me into like this higher Spirit

1215
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:34,599
of doing it for myself because um the

1216
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:38,599
only thing that really bothered me was I

1217
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:40,839
had acne so I did the the 28 day cleanse

1218
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:43,480
and it healed my acne as well too are

1219
01:06:40,839 --> 01:06:44,839
there any other um notices that you felt

1220
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,920
you know health benefits that you

1221
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:48,720
noticed after doing that 28 day cleanse

1222
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,440
that you may not have been going into

1223
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,599
the cleanse to heal but it just happened

1224
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:57,000
anyway yes a lot I had my brain started

1225
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:59,200
going faster was shooting faster the way

1226
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,520
I think and talk and everything and then

1227
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:05,119
also um I was feeling a lot happier too

1228
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,240
I guess I had a little slight anxiety as

1229
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,799
well because I was helping my mom and

1230
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,440
dealing with her her anxiety her

1231
01:07:09,799 --> 01:07:14,000
depression so I was like oh this will

1232
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,079
helped me as well so we both came on

1233
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,240
together through the same journey and we

1234
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,279
both benefited so both hailing together

1235
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,839
yes and my mom is like the most

1236
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:26,000
important person in my life so that's

1237
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:28,119
why I wanted to make sure she heals and

1238
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,319
be happy that's so beautiful that you

1239
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:32,480
went into into this helping your mom

1240
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:36,400
with such a pure heart and then you end

1241
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,359
up healing as well yes yes and so I'm in

1242
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,520
I'm from Vegas so there's a lot of

1243
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,920
people I work with also they have their

1244
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,240
symptoms so then I'm also helping them

1245
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,400
like heal with certain telling them what

1246
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,839
to eat and they're starting to also heal

1247
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:52,559
and do the lemon water and the celery

1248
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:55,240
juice as well so it's like it becoming

1249
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,359
like now they look at me like I'm like

1250
01:07:55,240 --> 01:08:00,359
the person to help them also and I keep

1251
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:02,079
referring everyone to go to Medical

1252
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:05,520
medium and Anthony

1253
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:08,279
Williams to find out more but a lot of

1254
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:11,039
them I think they're just too lazy to go

1255
01:08:08,279 --> 01:08:13,799
research on their own and read and so

1256
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,440
they they account me to do it depend on

1257
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:17,640
me to do it and then they just listen to

1258
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,759
me but I gave them all the information

1259
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,880
and where is at to show them how to find

1260
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,359
the information as well but that's okay

1261
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,839
I think everyone it comes at you know

1262
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,319
when it's the right time for them as

1263
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:28,199

1268
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,159
parts of the medical medium information

1269
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:43,000
oh man favorite part I I really find I

1270
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:46,600
listen to his uh podcast a lot and just

1271
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,520
listening to his stories and all the

1272
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:52,319
information relates to how I'm thinking

1273
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,839
so it's the same mindset like I've

1274
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,839
because I always been in the health

1275
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,679
industry testing a lot of supplements

1276
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:00,679
and everything but I didn't know exactly

1277
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:03,159
like what's the proper the right way

1278
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:05,520
which one is good for you and my mom was

1279
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:08,960
taking collagen too this was the part

1280
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,440
that really also helped and she uh we

1281
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,839
took her to get a lung CTI chest x-ray

1282
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:17,239
and they found um what is it called

1283
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:19,480
nodules in her chest right in her lungs

1284
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:21,279
so as after that all we started doing

1285
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:24,080
the cleanse and I think we went and got

1286
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:26,640
back a retest 6 months later and it went

1287
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,279
away too that how we knew and because we

1288
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,000
stopped the collagen I think it was the

1289
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:33,400
collagen that she was taking non-stop in

1290
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,199
a lot of collagens cuz she thinks it's

1291
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,839
good for her skin a lot of people take

1292
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:40,480
that for their skin yeah they don't nor

1293
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:43,000
right so I we I stopped it from reading

1294
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,880
the celery book I have the celery juice

1295
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,839
book and it said no collagen on there

1296
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,319
that's how I found out and I told my mom

1297
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:51,960
to stop immediately and then after that

1298
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,960
uh 6 months later we went back for the

1299
01:09:51,960 --> 01:10:01,080
CT scan and her her nodules went away

1300
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,080
too that's incredible that's huge

1301
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:07,679
yeah yeah even her stomach the bloating

1302
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:10,560
everything went away even and The Poets

1303
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:15,560
too she got a colonoscopy all the pops

1304
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:17,320
are gone as well w wow H and this is

1305
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,800
only within like we just started last

1306
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:22,880
summer since cover City this was our

1307
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,159
journey so that's why now we're just

1308
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,840
excited to be

1309
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:28,440
here and on top of that not just the

1310
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,600
healing and the health benefits I love

1311
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:34,360
anony Williams passion and the the way

1312
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:37,679
he teaches like us to believe in

1313
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:41,040
ourselves and give us hope to help

1314
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:43,360
ourself you know and that it he teaches

1315
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,640
us to love life again and love one

1316
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,800
another that

1317
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:50,719
compassion it's just everything that

1318
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:52,440
I've that's like who I was before too

1319
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,280
it's just around the people sometimes

1320
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:56,840
where you work or you run into a lot of

1321
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,719
people those energies kind of drain you

1322
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,560
and pull you down but with Anthony

1323
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:03,040
William it's the opposite he gives back

1324
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:06,560
the energy to help us uplift and become

1325
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:09,360
who we truly are so that's what I like

1326
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,760
about the medical medium community no

1327
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,080
it's incredible and a lot of people talk

1328
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,960
about their healing Journey being one

1329
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:17,280
that where they're healing their health

1330
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,199
but also very spiritual did you have any

1331
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:22,080
spiritual lessons I certainly did after

1332
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:24,400
my 28 day cleanse it's just like they

1333
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,600
were saying in the book it was almost

1334
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,080
like going backwards I was going reverse

1335
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,560
like back to my 20s and then high school

1336
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:35,000
I had all these memories like all these

1337
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:37,040
uh almost not trauma but the discomfort

1338
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,679
it slowly like came out and it just

1339
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,320
keeps loosening and fading away and I

1340
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:45,239
was like wanted to keep going on this

1341
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,440
spiritual journey with the after the 28

1342
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:50,040
day cleanse and so even today I'm still

1343
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,960
I'm excited about the spiritual book

1344
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,800
coming out for in March March March 18

1345
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:59,320
all right all right we know the date

1346
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:00,840
we're excited yeah so thank you so much

1347
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:02,679
and isn't your mom so lucky to have you

1348
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,840
to introduce you to all this incredible

1349
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:07,000
information from medical media you know

1350
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,719
before the medical I was praying and

1351
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,679
praying to the upper realm to help my

1352
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:13,840
mom and then all of a sudden it just

1353
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:16,159
came I feel like medic like Anthony just

1354
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,280
answered our prayers and because I know

1355
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,560
a lot of people run into medical medium

1356
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:23,360
on Facebook and social media but it's

1357
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,719
not in their head yet it's like it has

1358
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,760
to like grasp you for you to catch it

1359
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:33,440
not anybody can just accept it so it

1360
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:36,080
takes a type of um I don't know like a

1361
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:38,679
um like you have an Infinity with it to

1362
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,400
for them to reach out and just grab you

1363
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:43,480
to accept it it's not that easy so it's

1364
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,880
almost like a pebble sand in the big

1365
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:49,360
vast river that you know you can accept

1366
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,080

1367
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:53,960

1618
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:45,520
out of options for food he's always

1619
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,639

just put in like if they've got potato

1627
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:00,920
they'll just put potato in the website

1628
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,040
and then it will give them options for

1629
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,280
all the different potato recipes or

1630
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,760
they'll just put in the ingredient they

1631
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,800
have and then work around that with all

1632
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,280

medical medium information so about 9

1664
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:21,920
years ago I had a severe um stasis

1665
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:25,360
outbreak where I ended up losing all the

1666
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,800
skin on my hair on my scalp down my neck

1667
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:30,960
down my chest my stomach and then like

1668
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:33,719
sores out throughout my legs and I did a

1669
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,360
couple things um that healed me a little

1670
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:37,920
bit and then I found medical medium

1671
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:41,480

1672
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,880

1721
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:37,360

which she did on more than one occasion

1807
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:08,679

medium information how long have you

1988
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:14,239
been using it for um my mom got me into

1989
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:17,280
it um I've been doing it for about 5

1990
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:19,800
years now and then I started in

1991
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:22,159
2018 like when his right after his first

1992
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,760
book came out is when I started reading

1993
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:26,840
and dabbling into it so what compelled

1994
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:29,480
you to get into this what were you going

1995
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:31,560
through at the time um I had eczema that

1996
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,760
had just spurred all of a sudden and I

1997
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:34,159
didn't know how to get rid of it I had

1998
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,840
seen so many different doctors and

1999
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:38,239
dermatologists and nobody could get rid

2000
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:41,480
of it so I was interested in seeing if I

2001
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:44,000
could help that was initial and then why

2002
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:46,679
share it with your daughter she had some

2003
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,119
really weird H situations that I just

2004
01:37:46,679 --> 01:37:50,840
like we don't know what was going on so

2005
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:52,679
a l thankful that it was able to help

2006
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:56,560
her I mean that's even more important to

2007
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:58,960
me that helped you and not just

2008
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:01,800
me yeah I had a lot of like heart

2009
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,080
palpitations and anxiety and stuff and

2010
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,080
my anxiety is almost gone now heart

2011
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:08,320
palpitations are a lot better ever since

2012
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,599
I started doing it so just feel

2013
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,920
healthier overall so it's great that's

2014
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:14,639
incredible and what are some of your

2015
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,800
favorite things about the protocol I

2016
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:19,280
personally love the celery

2017
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,880
juice yeah it is good it's refreshing

2018
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:24,080
and it's just a great way to start the

2019
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,719
day yeah and did you stop just with the

2020
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:28,080
celery juice or how did you start

2021
01:38:25,719 --> 01:38:30,119
implementing things mine was just celery

2022
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:32,480
juice at first and then heavy metal

2023
01:38:30,119 --> 01:38:34,119
detox smoothie and then slowly adding

2024
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,560
things in and it's just it's really

2025
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:37,400
interesting to see how your taste buds

2026
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,760
Chang and all of a sudden vegetables are

2027
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:41,920
just tasting so much better everything

2028
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:44,080
tastes really delicious fruit is amazing

2029
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,040
and tastes better than it used to

2030
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,000
because your taste buds

2031
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,560
change and then can you talk a little

2032
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,719
bit more in depth about your health

2033
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:53,719
benefits that you experienced uh using

2034
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:56,040
the medical medium information mhm well

2035
01:38:53,719 --> 01:38:58,040
I had developed anxiety and I didn't I

2036
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,840
had no idea why and looking back I think

2037
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:03,840
it was related to me taking out some

2038
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:06,320
metal cavities merre cavities so um that

2039
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,440
went went away like 95% so that was

2040
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,000
really awesome and it was just weird I

2041
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:12,239
would get so anxious and I didn't know

2042
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,920
why and then it just all went away and

2043
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:17,040
then right when I started the protocols

2044
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:19,880
I was um just starting to need readers

2045
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,560
for vision and then uh with doing the

2046
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,679
heavy metal detox then I no longer

2047
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:25,560
needed them so I never really had to use

2048
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:28,239
them so my eyes just improved just

2049
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,880
enough where I don't need them I mean I

2050
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:32,760
do use contacts for far away but I don't

2051
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,360
need readers so that's incredible yeah

2052
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:35,880
so that was really exciting do you have

2053
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:38,239
an encouraging message you would like to

2054
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:41,480
share with the community watching

2055
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:43,040
online um I mean just start somewhere

2056
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,719
and then you'll eventually start to see

2057
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:48,880
the benefits and I mean it can't hurt

2058
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:50,599
you so yeah yeah it's really special

2059
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,320

in your health and the way that you feel

2061
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:58,239

2062
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:59,440
deal with so yeah and now you're here

2121
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:19,800
didn't know what was wrong with me I

2122
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,280
tried you know the whole story I tried

2123
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:24,599
everything I I have like this big of a

2124
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:27,880
pile of like medical records of

2125
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:31,639
alternative medic Med medicine I had my

2126
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:33,040
teeth uh I had my my my my jaws drilled

2127
01:42:31,639 --> 01:42:34,719
because I thought maybe it's from there

2128
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:37,239
I had an heart inflammation and nobody

2129
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,760
took it serious it was really horrible I

2130
01:42:37,239 --> 01:42:41,440
thought I was going to die and I think I

2131
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:42,159
would have died and I had serious you

2132
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,800
know

2133
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:48,599
also neurological self going on panic

2134
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:50,000
attacks as well and I was so miserable

2135
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:52,520
and the worst thing was that I had a

2136
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,199
child I had a young child and that's how

2137
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:57,880
it you know with heavy metals so he was

2138
01:42:55,199 --> 01:43:00,520
very like he cried a lot as an infant

2139
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:01,239
and that really I'm a single mom and

2140
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:04,599
that

2141
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:06,800
really pushed me off the cliff I tried

2142
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:09,480
to recover I didn't know I did all the

2143
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,480
things wrong like I went on a keto diet

2144
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:14,280
at the end because I was like okay maybe

2145
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:16,800
it's the sugars I eating way too much

2146
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:18,719
sugars so I cut the sugars out and there

2147
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:21,679
was they gave me the last push Chuck

2148

anymore it's really horrible it's a

2153
01:43:30,679 --> 01:43:33,800
really horrible time and you know we

2154
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:37,400
suffered so

2155
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:39,440
much and then 2016 I discovered Anthony

2156
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:42,000
I did a lot of things before that we

2157
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:43,320
already in line I took supplements for

2158
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,159
the first time in my life before it's

2159
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:48,800
like vitamin C artificial like I'm never

2160
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:50,320
going to take as corbic acid never so

2161
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,000
then I was like okay you might I might

2162
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:53,719
as well try this and then I just look

2163
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,040
for the best one and

2164
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:58,440
I had like other supplements that now I

2165
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:00,920
know were coming from my com medium and

2166
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:03,679
somebody told me oh I think you have um

2167
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:05,360
um adrenal issues as well because you

2168
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:07,400
know I had to get up in Wake up in the

2169
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:10,040
in the night because my baby was crying

2170
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:13,560
like 16 times at night and yelling in my

2171
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:16,400
ear and as was like what what oh okay my

2172
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:19,000
baby so you know my my adrenals were

2173
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,000
like gone because this was went on for

2174
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,360
years that I was so stressed out I

2175
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,840
couldn't sleep anymore cuz it took came

2176
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:29,520
so long to fall asleep that I just I was

2177
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:30,920
a mess and my adrenals were a mess I

2178
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,800
thought I was going to die next moment

2179
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:36,159
and I took you know ashwaganda for

2180
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:38,679
example I got this book on adrenal

2181
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:40,560
fatigue and I know now that everything

2182
01:44:38,679 --> 01:44:42,520
was inspired by medical medium of course

2183
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,679
where did they know that ashwaganda

2184
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:47,960
ashwag is for the you know I took but I

2185
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:50,320
took all these supplements how do you

2186
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:53,719
call it this this adrenal from cows I

2187
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:57,040
took I took liver cow's liver

2188
01:44:53,719 --> 01:45:00,280
I did everything my vitamin D high do I

2189
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:02,639
did the B12 shots I did everything I

2190
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:05,119
could get my hands on and nothing worked

2191
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:08,520
at the end I did gon Gerson Therapy is

2192
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:12,000
like a you know so I resonated with that

2193
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:14,360
and they took also B12 andum um I

2194
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,239
whatever I I took I was in line with

2195
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:18,400
doing at all yes I was doing that and I

2196
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:19,960
was just the coffee Animas like already

2197
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:22,000
hard this heart inflammation like this

2198
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:23,920
low grain infection and I could not

2199
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,880
tolerate it I like was going to have a

2200
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,360
heart attack so I stopped the thank

2201
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:29,960
goodness I stopped these coffee Animas

2202
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:32,080
because now we know from medical medium

2203
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:34,760
this is like really damaging for the

2204
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:37,199
liver that's the nervous system whatever

2205
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:38,960
I guess too so I I did this and people

2206
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:41,440
were telling me why do you do GS and you

2207
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:44,360
don't have cancer I'm like yeah but what

2208
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:45,840
do I do I don't know what to do well

2209
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,639
something's wrong like seriously and I

2210
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,199
don't know what it is and no doctor

2211
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:51,679
believes me they all say yeah you're

2212
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:53,560

because I went to get my jaws like

2216
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:02,800

2217
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:06,480
there's an infection in the gum cuz I

2218
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:08,360

2219
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,960
that dentist I went three times to have

01:46:34,119 --> 01:46:37,760
uh if you can't work anymore how is it

2232
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,840
called again like a disability yes I'm

2233
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,800
on disability because of Epstein bar

2234
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,480
virus and before that I went to a

2235
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:49,239
practitioner he diagnosed me with

2236
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:51,520
some whatever methods EP bar was among

2237
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:53,199
other things like EP bar is all right

2238
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,520
and then when she told me that's the

2239
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:58,080
reason why she was this disabled like oh

2240
01:46:56,520 --> 01:47:01,320
this must be serious I'm going to look

2241
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:04,400
into it so one night I went on the

2242
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:06,320
internet AB Ste bar virus I Googled it

2243
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,560
and I found Anthony's book Anthony's

2244
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:10,239

2248
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:21,520
me I mean I was

2249
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:23,239

don't know a couple of weeks later

2253
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:31,920
probably I found this website I found

2254
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:33,800
Anthony and this book had just come out

2255
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,119
in German too the first book and I

2256
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,040
ordered it in English because I didn't

2257
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:39,639
have much money it was cheaper thank God

2258
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:42,199
I did because the German translation is

2259
01:47:39,639 --> 01:47:43,880
really oh no it's horrible that book my

2260
01:47:42,199 --> 01:47:47,119

2262
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:50,800
book I got the English version I open it

2263
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,159
I'm like okay that's it you know I doing

2264
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:55,080
I'm doing everything I did right I was

2265
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:56,880
already juicing because of G on I had

2266
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:59,360
all the tools I had the vitamins for my

2267
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,719
mom cuz she's very health conscious she

2268
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:04,159
did the green smoothie things and stuff

2269
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:06,480
long before so I started everything

2270
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:08,960
celery juice hmbs the all the

2271
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,440
supplements whatever I put my hands on

2272
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,639
but I didn't take this the the no foods

2273
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:16,679
that serious so it took me a long time

2274
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:18,719
to really get off the no Foods because I

2275
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:21,880
also because I was feeling better so my

2276
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:23,639
son came in back into my life like I

2277
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:25,239
could I could take a take care of him

2278
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:28,520
more and more and of course he was

2279
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:30,800
eating no Foods you know like a gyro

2280
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,560
stuff so I'm like no this smells good

2281
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,599
you know have let me have a bite but

2282
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,280
then I realized later that it really

2283
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:39,639
makes a difference if I cut out the no

2284
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:42,000
foods and I went fat free and saltree I

2285
01:48:39,639 --> 01:48:44,719
mean now I'm I went back a little bit

2286
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,239
but I I have that leeway now and I

2287
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:49,560
really I'm so grateful I can't even say

2288
01:48:47,239 --> 01:48:52,159
I this saved my life or this knowledge

2289
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:54,000

2323
01:50:11,119 --> 01:50:15,239
and my teeth would have still been be

2324
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:16,719
there if I would have found Anthony

2325
01:50:15,239 --> 01:50:18,199
before if I would have found him before

2326
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,560
my son wouldn't even would have stopped

2327
01:50:18,199 --> 01:50:24,119
crying because now I know if I had

2328
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:26,599
detoxed him as an infant we would have a

2329
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:27,920
had a beautiful life so I had to go

2330
01:50:26,599 --> 01:50:31,440
through all

2331
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:34,239
this hardship I don't know for what for

2332
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:36,400
a Sal gold maybe I don't know but it's

2333
01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:38,280
okay you found it now you're here now

2334
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:41,079
yeah and I'm so like I'm never going to

2335
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:43,400
leave this path yeah it's on my path

2336
01:50:41,079 --> 01:50:45,480
it's it's amazing does your son now do

2337
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:49,560
it at all is he open to it as a teenage

2338
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:51,760
boy well he did he used to until uh

2339
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,360
about a year ago I guess he fell off the

2340
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,159
bandwagon like big before he was even

2341
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,719
hardcore than me more hardcore than me

2342
01:50:55,159 --> 01:50:58,400
he was like Mom no you don't need that

2343
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:00,679
salt any anymore I'm like no just a

2344
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,639
little bit salt for my potatoes you know

2345
01:51:00,679 --> 01:51:04,400
he's like no let's put it away and so

2346
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,360
and fat like completely fat you don't

2347
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:09,880
need that fat so he was like really on

2348
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:11,639
board doing everything with me even

2349
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:13,239
getting up early in the morning I guess

2350
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:15,360
school school starts at 7:00 so you

2351
01:51:13,239 --> 01:51:16,920
would even get up earlier than that like

2352
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:19,079
earlier than 600 just to do the heavy

2353
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:21,159
metal detox everything but then all all

2354
01:51:19,079 --> 01:51:24,560
of a sudden he got he fell into the

2355
01:51:21,159 --> 01:51:26,400
protein trap mhm and now he's like oh

2356
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:28,079
meat you know meat is fine because meat

2357
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:32,480
can be part of the medical medium diet

2358
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:35,000
but then he started gluten even SED eggs

2359
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:37,320
ouch but then he got sick from the eggs

2360
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,960
like scratchy throat and he felt like

2361
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:41,440
okay so I think I should leave the eggs

2362
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,719
also I worked on it really hard he just

2363
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,400
takes the eggs out but he eats gluten he

2364
01:51:43,719 --> 01:51:48,360
eats milk Keir he's he feels nauseous

2365
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:50,599
all the time he's like you know what but

2366
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:52,320
it's just because I ate too much but

2367
01:51:50,599 --> 01:51:54,079
it's okay everyone's journey is

2368
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:57,920
different and this is a this isn't a

2369
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:59,679
one-sized fits all uh and he's and I

2370
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:02,079
just pray every day that he comes back

2371
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,560
and I know he's not completely off

2372
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:05,159
because when he's sick then he asked me

2373
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:06,520
you know he's taking supplements and

2374
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:10,040

how did you discover medical medium

2535
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:09,480
information um it was through my mom and

2536
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:11,760
my best friend Dalton who I've known

2537
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:15,719
since I was 6 months we joke that we are

2538
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:17,079
souls that flew into Earth together and

2539
01:59:15,719 --> 01:59:19,920
uh both of them around the same time in

2540
01:59:17,079 --> 01:59:23,000
2018 were like hey you really need to

2541
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,719
look at this you know page on Instagram

2542
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,639
and at the time I had been searching for

2543
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,440
a very long time for some healing I had

2544
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:31,079
done every fat diet at one point I was

2545
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:32,719
doing avocados with bacon because I was

2546
01:59:31,079 --> 01:59:34,480
told your brain was made out of fat so I

2547
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:37,599
was doing like the I mean I was trying

2548
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:39,760
everything you know and um just started

2549
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,639
doing lemon honey water and started to

2550
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:43,280
feel so good and learned you know the

2551
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:46,079
effects that it had on your liver and

2552
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:48,040
that the lemons detoxed it and the water

2553
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:50,520
rehydrated it and the glue and the Honey

2554
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:52,040
gave you glucose replenishment and I

2555
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:54,440
just got really into it and then started

2556
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:57,280
doing celery juice and then cutting out

2557
01:59:54,440 --> 02:00:00,119
the no foods and then doing the vimergy

2558
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:01,599
supplementation and the meditations and

2559
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:04,560
now it's just you know completely

2560
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:06,679
transformed my life I'm living my dream

2561
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,719
uh now doing a totally different career

2562
02:00:06,679 --> 02:00:12,920
living my purpose and just feeling so

2563
02:00:09,719 --> 02:00:15,239
good so much energy so I'm so grateful

2564
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:16,520
that uh my best friend Dalton and my mom

2565
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:18,440
brought me that information and now we

2566
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:20,400
have our own Community you know doing it

2567
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:22,800
so it's just been awesome that's so

2568
02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:24,040
awesome how incredible what are some of

2569
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,719
the health benefits you've really

2570
02:00:24,040 --> 02:00:29,320
noticed the difference uh of healing

2571
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:31,760
from medical medum information I was I

2572
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:34,360
always had a very addictive personality

2573
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:36,880
from a very young age and so when I was

2574
02:00:34,360 --> 02:00:38,520
younger I had eating disorders and then

2575
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,760
when I was in college I just felt like I

2576
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:42,639
couldn't keep up I started taking

2577
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:44,920
Aderall and then I started smoking weed

2578
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:46,880
and obviously reading the literature and

2579
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:49,920
reading the scripture of the books I

2580
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:52,040
realized that that was heavy metals so I

2581
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:55,239
started detoxing the heavy metals and

2582
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:58,599
now I am free of all of that and I just

2583
02:00:55,239 --> 02:01:01,400
wake up myself and with so much energy

2584
02:00:58,599 --> 02:01:03,079
and um don't have those chains of

2585
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:05,119
addiction anymore so that would be

2586
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:07,440
something huge but I was telling Amber

2587
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:10,000
on an interview too there's so many

2588
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:11,560
peripheral healing that has taken place

2589
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,719
as well like I used to hate to travel

2590
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:16,360
with my husband because I would get such

2591
02:01:13,719 --> 02:01:17,760
high travel anxiety and it just then I'd

2592
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:21,440
be on the vacation and it wouldn't be

2593
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:23,880
fun you know i' I'd have anxiety or um

2594
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:26,560
whatever it may be all that's gone I've

2595
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:29,320
gone now I've done two trips to Italy

2596
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:31,040
I've gone to Cabo many times I am

2597
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:35,480
excited to travel and have these

2598
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:38,320
experiences so um it it's just so

2599
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:40,760
incredible um the list of healing is so

2600
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:43,960
immense but obviously freeing yourself

2601
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:47,400
of addiction is huge reconnecting with

2602
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:49,639
My Soul living my dream and you know

2603
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:53,079
being able to experience life in such a

2604
02:01:49,639 --> 02:01:55,159
fuller manner has just been and

2605
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:57,239
lifechanging say reconnecting with your

2606
02:01:55,159 --> 02:01:58,960
soul were there any uh spiritual lessons

2607
02:01:57,239 --> 02:02:00,760
you learned on your way your your

2608
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,400
healing way well I think it's funny that

2609
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:04,079
medical medium says that not a lot of

2610
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,760
people pray to the angels because I feel

2611
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:08,199
like I got a direct line every day I'm

2612
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:10,960
like Angel of Mercy Angel of the unknown

2613
02:02:08,199 --> 02:02:13,280
Angels you know so I am so connected

2614
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:16,840
with praying to the angels and calling

2615
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:19,920
on them for help and and God as well and

2616
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:22,159
um that wasn't as woven into my daily

2617
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,639
life I was always you know a believer

2618
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:27,440
and spiritual but it's just deepened

2619
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:30,400
that relationship for myself um and then

2620
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,480
also the meditations like there has been

2621
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:34,360
times where I've done the full moon

2622
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:35,840
emotional wounds healing meditation

2623
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:39,440
where I've just balled and I could

2624
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:43,040
literally feel um you know pain and and

2625
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:45,199
toxic energy being pulled out of my body

2626
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:48,920
so I mean all of it it's all been so

2627
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:51,199
amazing um for me so what is one of the

2628
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:54,320
most profound lessons you've learned on

2629
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:57,079
your journey of healing these these

2630
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:59,520
conditions you are dealing with most

2631
02:02:57,079 --> 02:03:03,520
profound lesson from

2632
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:06,079
healing I think that God gave us

2633
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:09,800
everything we need to

2634
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:14,119
heal and there's evil out there that is

2635
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:16,400
trying to keep us sick and if you keep

2636
02:03:14,119 --> 02:03:18,400
searching I was around 30 when I started

2637
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:21,159
sou searching in FA medical medium I was

2638
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:23,159
really trying to find a way to heal um

2639
02:03:21,159 --> 02:03:25,679
it's out there and that your body wants

2640
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:29,440
to heal you know your body really does

2641
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:32,599
want to heal and it works I tried

2642
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:35,599
everything so I know this works so um I

2643
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:37,199
think the biggest lesson is just God is

2644
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:38,520
good and the tools and the resources are

2645
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,960
out there and there's a path to healing

2646
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,960
for everybody you just have to be

2647
02:03:39,960 --> 02:03:44,159
patient and disciplined and use your

2648
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,960
free will to get there beautiful

2649
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:47,559

and I'm really excited to meet you

2773
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:53,240
because I feel like more young people

2774
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:55,600
need to have the opportunity to do these

2775
02:29:53,240 --> 02:29:58,080
things early before it's too late wow I

2776
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,439
love that I love that no it's true right

2777
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:01,560
I mean younger people need to take care

2778
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:04,359
of themselves before something happens

2779
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:05,880
but it's not how things work you know

2780
02:30:04,359 --> 02:30:07,399
right it just doesn't seem like that's

2781
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:10,279
how it works you're indestructible

2782
02:30:07,399 --> 02:30:12,840
indestructible and then something goes

2783
02:30:10,279 --> 02:30:15,080
wrong right hopefully trying to share

2784
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:16,880
more of that before everything goes

2785
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:20,200

3005
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:05,200
nice to see you again tonight yes I'd

3006
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:07,920
like to answer ask question for myself

3007
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:10,760
tonight so I'd like to ask for myself

3008
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:12,800
tonight um for my teeth they're falling

3009
02:40:10,760 --> 02:40:14,600
apart so much because of all the stress

3010
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:16,240
I had the last couple of years so I

3011
02:40:14,600 --> 02:40:18,479
really last couple years have been very

3012
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:20,800
stressful yes and I think the adrenaline

3013
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:23,279
just is e heating them up and what do I

3014
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:24,920
do to stop it is the stress continual

3015
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:26,680
yes and so your adrenaline's always

3016
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:29,040
going up and then when you finally relax

3017
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:30,760
it it goes up again and it goes up again

3018
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:32,479
yes I used to have hot flashes from all

3019
02:40:30,760 --> 02:40:34,359
this stuff too I guess but now that

3020
02:40:32,479 --> 02:40:36,720
after the light blath it it really like

3021
02:40:34,359 --> 02:40:38,160
the hot flashes were gone okay and um

3022
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:40,760
that's good we're going to do another

3023
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:42,800
light blast tonight I know I know but I

3024
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:44,960
what about my teeth like am I what can I

3025
02:40:42,800 --> 02:40:46,640
do like in the night put something on it

3026
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:49,800
I'm doing the protocols and everything

3027
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:51,960
but what what can I do to stop the

3028
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:54,439
they like they're like time capsules too

3029
02:40:51,960 --> 02:40:56,840
you know from years ago I know and then

3030
02:40:54,439 --> 02:40:58,920
I know that but adrenaline tends to

3031
02:40:56,840 --> 02:41:01,080
knock all of our nutrients out and

3032
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:03,160

lot of dark interference I don't know

3284
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:23,239
maybe the spiritual book could help with

3285
02:52:19,439 --> 02:52:27,520
some of it I think I I I believe it will

3286
02:52:23,239 --> 02:52:30,000
okay I believe it will yeah no I I

3287
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:31,600
understand the challenges uh they just

3288
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,399
seem to be always there especially when

3289
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:38,120
you have a very bright light okay then

3290
02:52:35,399 --> 02:52:40,239
you get challenged more unfortunately

3291
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:41,479
yeah the better of a person you are the

3292
02:52:40,239 --> 02:52:44,760
more you get

3293
02:52:41,479 --> 02:52:49,200

people that are not good people they

3301
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:08,760
never get challenged until they like

3302
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:10,160
some have a heart attack or something

3303
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:12,160
down the road whatever it is they don't

3304
02:53:10,160 --> 02:53:14,399

yeah that's my short answer I also had a

3763
03:12:54,479 --> 03:12:59,080
question what's your question should I

3764
03:12:56,880 --> 03:13:01,239
read it to you or show it to you what

3765
03:12:59,080 --> 03:13:03,600
kind of question is it it's read

3766
03:13:01,239 --> 03:13:05,319
nefarious it's just like I knew I was

3767
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:06,439
going to get I knew I was going to get

3768
03:13:05,319 --> 03:13:09,720
so

3769
03:13:06,439 --> 03:13:11,960
nervous that it's not ambiguous it's not

3770
03:13:09,720 --> 03:13:11,960
it's

3771
03:13:15,200 --> 03:13:21,080
not it's because you have to

3772
03:13:18,319 --> 03:13:24,600
I don't have to I just really want no no

3773
03:13:21,080 --> 03:13:27,160
like is do you have to do that pipe or

3774
03:13:24,600 --> 03:13:28,920
is there any other options I i' be open

3775
03:13:27,160 --> 03:13:32,560
to other

3776
03:13:28,920 --> 03:13:35,520
options I have I have agency here but I

3777
03:13:32,560 --> 03:13:38,120
have fear about where are you from are

3778
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:39,600
you in I'm from here you're from here

3779
03:13:38,120 --> 03:13:41,640
and you got those pipes is that what it

3780
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:44,399
is and you want I have a galvanized pipe

3781
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:46,399
I'm going to replace it uh because it

3782
03:13:44,399 --> 03:13:49,239
could leech lead and so now I have a

3783
03:13:46,399 --> 03:13:51,720
choice you had to if you had to see if

3784
03:13:49,239 --> 03:13:54,880
there's other

3785
03:13:51,720 --> 03:13:58,359
options I very weird question it's not a

3786
03:13:54,880 --> 03:14:01,680

much thanks for coming what's happening

4108
03:27:39,880 --> 03:27:46,319
oh um I just have a question so I've

4109
03:27:42,040 --> 03:27:48,080
never been able to visualize and also um

4110
03:27:46,319 --> 03:27:51,040
I don't listen in her voice and I was

4111
03:27:48,080 --> 03:27:52,840
just wondering you you can visualize

4112
03:27:51,040 --> 03:27:54,680
you're talking about like visualization

4113
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:58,000
like I close my eyes and it's just black

4114
03:27:54,680 --> 03:28:00,439
I don't see anything but you you you

4115
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:02,479
know what you're trying to

4116
03:28:00,439 --> 03:28:04,279
visualize do you know what you're trying

4117
03:28:02,479 --> 03:28:05,720
to right when when mean if I think of

4118
03:28:04,279 --> 03:28:07,160
like I'm trying to visualize an apple I

4119
03:28:05,720 --> 03:28:09,640
won't see anything you won't see

4120
03:28:07,160 --> 03:28:11,840
anything it's there it's there that's

4121
03:28:09,640 --> 03:28:15,160
okay but I was wondering is that metals

4122
03:28:11,840 --> 03:28:18,120
or is that the no you might be like even

4123
03:28:15,160 --> 03:28:20,160
Beyond visualiz ization you have to

4124
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:22,720
understand like it could be bigger than

4125
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:24,120
that it's not about medals for that like

4126
03:28:22,720 --> 03:28:27,040
you might not be able to visualize

4127
03:28:24,120 --> 03:28:28,960
because you're you're maybe seeing even

4128
03:28:27,040 --> 03:28:31,600
more than you

4129
03:28:28,960 --> 03:28:33,840
know there's some I've seen stuff like

4130
03:28:31,600 --> 03:28:36,080
that happen and spirit tells me it does

4131
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:38,439
exist where there's a reason why you

4132
03:28:36,080 --> 03:28:40,880
don't see the image because you're

4133
03:28:38,439 --> 03:28:44,760
seeing all these other things around it

4134
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:47,120
out there so just liart okay think about

4135
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:48,720
that like don't don't look for the image

4136
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:50,080
look for the edges of everything when

4137
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:52,760
you visualize okay I don't know if it's

4138
03:28:50,080 --> 03:28:54,319
similar but not hearing an inner voice

4139
03:28:52,760 --> 03:28:55,760
like it's just kind of silent I don't

4140
03:28:54,319 --> 03:28:58,000
have like chatter or anything I don't

4141
03:28:55,760 --> 03:29:02,720
know if that's that might be a really

4142
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:02,720
good thing okay let's get a

4143
03:29:06,760 --> 03:29:12,000
picture because with me I'm either

4144
03:29:08,960 --> 03:29:14,840
hearing Spirit or my own thoughts so

4145
03:29:12,000 --> 03:29:16,760
yeah so um if I'm not thinking about

4146
03:29:14,840 --> 03:29:19,080
things I'm hearing spirit if you're not

4147
03:29:16,760 --> 03:29:21,160

4148
03:29:19,080 --> 03:29:23,800

4268
03:34:53,120 --> 03:34:57,680
listen the meaning of life has a few

4269
03:34:54,600 --> 03:35:02,199
things all wrapped up in one and one is

4270
03:34:57,680 --> 03:35:04,439
having compassion for animal life oh you

4271
03:35:02,199 --> 03:35:08,640

for animal life but they have a shut off

4278
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:26,600

compassionate for for I love I'm too

4299
03:36:20,479 --> 03:36:25,080
emotional about about that's a big piece

4300
03:36:23,239 --> 03:36:28,960
of the meaning of life that is a very

4301
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:32,040
big piece it's it's uh having the utmost

4302
03:36:28,960 --> 03:36:34,840
respect for life itself and I I think

4303
03:36:32,040 --> 03:36:38,800
that's lost I think that's you know

4304
03:36:34,840 --> 03:36:42,000
missing in Believe It or Not people

4305
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:44,000
enjoying their life doesn't mean that

4306
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:45,600
that's what that means you know of

4307
03:36:44,000 --> 03:36:47,600
course you want to enjoy your life but

4308
03:36:45,600 --> 03:36:50,319
people get confused where enjoying your

4309
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:51,640
life becomes the meaning of life it's

4310
03:36:50,319 --> 03:36:55,680
more than that

4311
03:36:51,640 --> 03:36:58,279
it's having that respect for life itself

4312
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:59,479
and that's something different and and

4313
03:36:58,279 --> 03:37:01,160
and that's part of the meaning of life

4314
03:36:59,479 --> 03:37:03,160
and there's more too I I might talk

4315

you have a sense of somebody who is a

4394
03:40:46,479 --> 03:40:53,120
distance away but this is advice for me

4395
03:40:49,800 --> 03:40:56,560
an adoptive mom of a 21-year-old drug

4396
03:40:53,120 --> 03:40:59,239
exposion utero weed addict just just

4397
03:40:56,560 --> 03:41:00,600
brings crisis after crisis after crisis

4398
03:40:59,239 --> 03:41:03,160
into his

4399
03:41:00,600 --> 03:41:06,720
life you got you have to Envision light

4400
03:41:03,160 --> 03:41:10,120
around them all the time have to okay

4401
03:41:06,720 --> 03:41:15,560
constantly because um because the light

4402
03:41:10,120 --> 03:41:18,120
was shut out keeps he keeps it shut out

4403
03:41:15,560 --> 03:41:19,560
because of some kind of internal despair

4404
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:22,560
but so you have to keep on putting the

4405
03:41:19,560 --> 03:41:24,960
light around so that eventually uh he

4406
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:27,800
can grab on to it and then start to

4407
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:30,000

possible to get rid of a virus to wipe

5084
04:20:36,640 --> 04:20:41,840
it out of your body or is it not yes are

5085
04:20:39,279 --> 04:20:44,960
all of them possible to wipe out it's

5086
04:20:41,840 --> 04:20:47,279
possible Poss some go dormant you know

5087
04:20:44,960 --> 04:20:48,960
when they go to sleep and you heal and

5088
04:20:47,279 --> 04:20:51,359
that's it and some you can get rid of

5089
04:20:48,960 --> 04:20:53,840
allog together can you get rid of herpes

5090
04:20:51,359 --> 04:20:55,640
or probably not it depends on where it

5091
04:20:53,840 --> 04:20:57,760
is what else is happening in your life

5092
04:20:55,640 --> 04:21:01,080
and how much you're doing it's it's it's

5093
04:20:57,760 --> 04:21:03,720
a job it's a job okay but it could be

5094
04:21:01,080 --> 04:21:05,560
done okay you want to get a picture uh

5095
04:21:03,720 --> 04:21:08,439

5096
04:21:05,560 --> 04:21:10,560
message for me especially for my eyes or

5097
04:21:08,439 --> 04:21:13,560

you sticking up for us and um I had a

5262
04:28:16,520 --> 04:28:22,640
question to follow up with from last

5263
04:28:18,439 --> 04:28:24,880
night yeah um so does a person's soul um

5264
04:28:22,640 --> 04:28:28,199
before it reincarnates on the earth does

5265
04:28:24,880 --> 04:28:28,199
it choose to be gay or

5266
04:28:30,000 --> 04:28:36,159
straight so it's a really good point um

5267
04:28:33,000 --> 04:28:38,359
I think what's happened right now with

5268
04:28:36,159 --> 04:28:40,840
gender and everything else I think that

5269
04:28:38,359 --> 04:28:44,000
there's so much confusion still I think

5270
04:28:40,840 --> 04:28:45,800
we're in the baby stage is of the world

5271
04:28:44,000 --> 04:28:48,680
understanding any of it kind of breaks

5272
04:28:45,800 --> 04:28:51,159
my heart a lot of confusion a lot of

5273
04:28:48,680 --> 04:28:53,920
misconceptions and I never got I never

5274
04:28:51,159 --> 04:28:55,680
got to uh into a place yet where I've

5275
04:28:53,920 --> 04:28:57,520
been able to talk about it I've been

5276
04:28:55,680 --> 04:29:01,880
doing all these other

5277
04:28:57,520 --> 04:29:04,359
things but whether anybody likes it or

5278
04:29:01,880 --> 04:29:07,880
not

5279
04:29:04,359 --> 04:29:11,199
um a soul can come into a different

5280
04:29:07,880 --> 04:29:12,680
gender body and be a different gender

5281
04:29:11,199 --> 04:29:16,199
soul

5282
04:29:12,680 --> 04:29:18,199

5325
04:31:09,600 --> 04:31:15,159
uh if you had it if if if if you had a

5326
04:31:12,319 --> 04:31:19,680
dream with me in there there there's

5327
04:31:15,159 --> 04:31:23,319
definitely like I have my whole life is

5328
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:26,560
I have dreamed and I've time traveled in

5329
04:31:23,319 --> 04:31:29,279
my dreams I have

5330
04:31:26,560 --> 04:31:31,520
um I sit up in my sleep and I do

5331
04:31:29,279 --> 04:31:34,319
readings in my sleep on people I haven't

5332
04:31:31,520 --> 04:31:36,319
met all these things do happen so I

5333
04:31:34,319 --> 04:31:38,840
don't doubt that if you had a dream with

5334
04:31:36,319 --> 04:31:43,119

5335
04:31:38,840 --> 04:31:44,800

we do to just you know darkness is

5392
04:33:53,119 --> 04:33:56,480
darkness is afraid of light and darkness

5393
04:33:54,799 --> 04:33:59,279
is behind so much on this planet look at

5394
04:33:56,480 --> 04:34:02,359
all the destruction yeah right just just

5395
04:33:59,279 --> 04:34:04,840
in Vision you know how darkness is weak

and it has no strength yeah it's all a

5397
04:34:04,840 --> 04:34:09,039
facade yeah and because light can stomp

it out and you just you just see light

5399
04:34:09,039 --> 04:34:12,719

all kinds of stuff instead I wanted to

5461
04:36:54,959 --> 04:36:58,000
tell you a funny story that will

5462
04:36:56,240 --> 04:37:00,279
hopefully make you feel happy a little

5463
04:36:58,000 --> 04:37:02,600
bit in return because you do so much for

5464
04:37:00,279 --> 04:37:04,600
us okay and I want you to know that I

5465
04:37:02,600 --> 04:37:06,799
brought the medical medium bar in the

5466
04:37:04,600 --> 04:37:10,439
form of wild blueberry juice

5467
04:37:06,799 --> 04:37:12,920
shots bringing it to potluck at work

5468
04:37:10,439 --> 04:37:15,119
okay and pour it in these little red cup

5469
04:37:12,920 --> 04:37:16,400
shot glasses and I put it on a tray I

5470
04:37:15,119 --> 04:37:19,480
was hoping this would make you laugh cuz

5471
04:37:16,400 --> 04:37:22,080
ites it does I'm already laughing and I

5472
04:37:19,480 --> 04:37:23,879
carryed around and I say shots shots who

5473
04:37:22,080 --> 04:37:25,480
wants shots and everybody stands up

5474
04:37:23,879 --> 04:37:26,760
because they think it's alcohol right

5475
04:37:25,480 --> 04:37:28,240
and they're really horrified because

5476
04:37:26,760 --> 04:37:30,561
you're really not supposed to have

5477
04:37:28,240 --> 04:37:33,199
alcohol at my work because it's a prison

5478
04:37:30,561 --> 04:37:34,879
and it's illegal to do that so they

5479
04:37:33,199 --> 04:37:36,879
think I'm running around like breaking

5480
04:37:34,879 --> 04:37:40,439
law but really I'm not I just tell them

5481
04:37:36,879 --> 04:37:42,639
it's a super antioxidant buzz and I hook

5482
04:37:40,439 --> 04:37:44,840

6695
05:42:33,760 --> 05:42:38,440
right

6696
05:42:35,960 --> 05:42:39,760
[Music]

6697
05:42:38,440 --> 05:42:42,680
you know one of the things that always

6698
05:42:39,760 --> 05:42:45,360
blows my mind is that we're always

6699
05:42:42,680 --> 05:42:47,600
governed by time here I mean right every

6700
05:42:45,360 --> 05:42:49,440
every minute it's about what time is it

6701
05:42:47,600 --> 05:42:51,920
time for your appointment time for this

6702
05:42:49,440 --> 05:42:53,958
time to wake up time to go to bed it's

6703
05:42:51,920 --> 05:42:57,160
always about time time there we go is

6704
05:42:53,958 --> 05:42:57,160
this for real I can hear

6705
05:42:58,878 --> 05:43:05,160
now all right all right you know we're

6706
05:43:02,478 --> 05:43:07,200
governed by time that's what it is

6707
05:43:05,160 --> 05:43:09,160
everything we do it's based on the

6708
05:43:07,200 --> 05:43:13,558
minute based on the

6709
05:43:09,160 --> 05:43:16,400
hour right we age every day it's time

6710
05:43:13,558 --> 05:43:19,760
that's how it works okay the earth goes

6711
05:43:16,400 --> 05:43:23,638
around the sun right and then every

6712
05:43:19,760 --> 05:43:27,160
minute clicks by all around the planet

6713
05:43:23,638 --> 05:43:30,798
time owns US it owns US physically it

6714
05:43:27,160 --> 05:43:34,360
really does and and that's hard because

6715
05:43:30,798 --> 05:43:37,920
human beings being owned is is never a

6716
05:43:34,360 --> 05:43:39,478
good feeling but time owns us here

6717
05:43:37,920 --> 05:43:42,798
physically on the

6718
05:43:39,478 --> 05:43:46,440
planet and but what happens with our

6719
05:43:42,798 --> 05:43:49,320
soul is time doesn't own our soul so it

6720
05:43:46,440 --> 05:43:51,000
may own us right now physically you wake

6721
05:43:49,320 --> 05:43:53,160
up in the morning you're like crap it's

6722
05:43:51,000 --> 05:43:55,600
8:00 in the morning I'm I'm

6723
05:43:53,160 --> 05:43:57,160
late you go to bed at night it's like I

6724
05:43:55,600 --> 05:44:00,000
went to bed too

6725
05:43:57,160 --> 05:44:01,718
late right oh I'm one of those people

6726
05:44:00,000 --> 05:44:05,440
that stays up through the night because

6727
05:44:01,718 --> 05:44:07,760
I everything comes to me at that point I

6728
05:44:05,440 --> 05:44:10,798
seem to come to life at night the world

6729
05:44:07,760 --> 05:44:15,600
is quiet I come to life at night right

6730
05:44:10,798 --> 05:44:19,320
you know that feeling but time owns our

6731
05:44:15,600 --> 05:44:22,638
physical body and all the things we do

6732
05:44:19,320 --> 05:44:27,718
here but it doesn't own our soul it has

6733
05:44:22,638 --> 05:44:30,600
no no Authority on your soul which is

6734
05:44:27,718 --> 05:44:34,040
unbelievable when you think about that

6735
05:44:30,600 --> 05:44:37,200
and our soul right is in us it's there

6736
05:44:34,040 --> 05:44:40,120
every day it's here but time time

6737
05:44:37,200 --> 05:44:43,600
doesn't run it time doesn't own it it's

6738
05:44:40,120 --> 05:44:47,798
its own thing so much

6739
05:44:43,600 --> 05:44:51,080
so okay that when we leave here time

6740
05:44:47,798 --> 05:44:53,600
doesn't own it then on any level or

6741
05:44:51,080 --> 05:44:55,520
control it on any level it doesn't

6742
05:44:53,600 --> 05:44:59,080
matter what planets are going around the

6743
05:44:55,520 --> 05:45:02,120
Sun Mars going around the sun earth

6744
05:44:59,080 --> 05:45:05,478

6817
05:48:26,160 --> 05:48:31,920
we have to know that we have to remember

6818
05:48:29,000 --> 05:48:36,080
that we have to honor that we have to

6819
05:48:31,920 --> 05:48:37,400
see that it's important to see it really

6820
05:48:36,080 --> 05:48:39,040
is

6821
05:48:37,400 --> 05:48:41,080
one of the things our soul has

6822
05:48:39,040 --> 05:48:44,360
information about is food Believe It or

6823
05:48:41,080 --> 05:48:47,360
Not Century after Century after Century

6824
05:48:44,360 --> 05:48:49,478
what did you eat five lifetimes ago what

6825
05:48:47,360 --> 05:48:51,558
did you what did you eat two lifetimes

6826
05:48:49,478 --> 05:48:54,120
ago were you somebody that lived in the

6827
05:48:51,558 --> 05:48:56,718
woods and you just ate rocks and dirt

6828
05:48:54,120 --> 05:48:59,160
and a soup of some seaweed and some

6829
05:48:56,718 --> 05:49:02,000
other stuff to survive what did you eat

6830
05:48:59,160 --> 05:49:04,840
did you eat twigs and berries what did

6831
05:49:02,000 --> 05:49:07,440
you eat in all these past lives right

6832
05:49:04,840 --> 05:49:09,840
our soul has all this information in it

6833
05:49:07,440 --> 05:49:12,680
about what you did last lifetime the

6834
05:49:09,840 --> 05:49:16,120
lifetime before that and far beyond that

6835
05:49:12,680 --> 05:49:18,600
it has all this incredible information

6836
05:49:16,120 --> 05:49:21,840
like books and books and books and books

6837
05:49:18,600 --> 05:49:24,558
worth is just all tied into

6838
05:49:21,840 --> 05:49:25,958
it but we have to know that and realize

6839
05:49:24,558 --> 05:49:27,680
it because we can go through a life

6840
05:49:25,958 --> 05:49:29,878
without even understanding our soul even

6841
05:49:27,680 --> 05:49:32,240
the a fraction of it did you know that

6842
05:49:29,878 --> 05:49:34,040
we a whole life can pass and we don't

6843
05:49:32,240 --> 05:49:36,000
even know any of this we're just living

6844
05:49:34,040 --> 05:49:38,400
our life walking around you know like

6845
05:49:36,000 --> 05:49:43,160
okay I'm living my life on planet

6846
05:49:38,400 --> 05:49:45,160
Earth yeah but we can't connect unless

6847
05:49:43,160 --> 05:49:47,360
we understand we should unless we

6848
05:49:45,160 --> 05:49:51,120
realize it we have to know a couple of

6849
05:49:47,360 --> 05:49:55,080
things the rule the rule that our soul

6850
05:49:51,120 --> 05:49:56,440
rides over time it rules over time time

6851
05:49:55,080 --> 05:49:58,760
can't touch

6852
05:49:56,440 --> 05:50:01,120
it another thing we have all this

6853
05:49:58,760 --> 05:50:04,200
information from all these lives

6854
05:50:01,120 --> 05:50:06,760
beforehand and sickness did you know you

6855
05:50:04,200 --> 05:50:08,478
could have healed before in five life

6856
05:50:06,760 --> 05:50:10,120
times ago two lifetimes ago last

6857
05:50:08,478 --> 05:50:11,680
lifetime ago do you know you may have

6858
05:50:10,120 --> 05:50:13,798
already healed did you know you could

6859
05:50:11,680 --> 05:50:15,878
have been sick already in a past

6860
05:50:13,798 --> 05:50:18,360
lifetime you could have been on mattress

6861
05:50:15,878 --> 05:50:21,040
Island and then a thousand years ago you

6862
05:50:18,360 --> 05:50:22,200
could have been on Hay Island just a

6863
05:50:21,040 --> 05:50:24,958
bunch of

6864
05:50:22,200 --> 05:50:27,840
grass with some kind of like wool

6865
05:50:24,958 --> 05:50:30,718
blanket thrown over you and that's it a

6866
05:50:27,840 --> 05:50:34,840
little fire right by

enough Spirit has I know I'm all over

6984
05:55:53,200 --> 05:55:57,600
the place today Spirit has a strange

6985
05:55:55,120 --> 05:55:59,920
sound a strange voice strange language

6986
05:55:57,600 --> 05:56:02,400
it's the weirdest thing I think at some

6987
05:55:59,920 --> 05:56:05,240
point I'm going to try to document that

6988
05:56:02,400 --> 05:56:08,240
so you know what it sounds like and what

6989
05:56:05,240 --> 05:56:08,240
the words are

6990
05:56:09,240 --> 05:56:13,878
it's not normal I can tell you

6991
05:56:11,840 --> 05:56:17,440
that

6992
05:56:13,878 --> 05:56:20,718
do it's just it's it's the words are

6993
05:56:17,440 --> 05:56:23,440
very not not usual words and I have to

6994
05:56:20,718 --> 05:56:25,240
change the word to match the same word

6995
05:56:23,440 --> 05:56:28,040
it's kind of like an ancient language

6996
05:56:25,240 --> 05:56:30,200
you know where the word is different

6997
05:56:28,040 --> 05:56:32,680
than the word but they're the same the

6998
05:56:30,200 --> 05:56:34,798
same meaning and everything they're just

6999
05:56:32,680 --> 05:56:37,040
a little different it's an older

7000
05:56:34,798 --> 05:56:40,638
language it's taking too many years to

7001
05:56:37,040 --> 05:56:43,440
figure out but I have to tell you guys

7002
05:56:40,638 --> 05:56:46,718

back to 2017 though absolutely okay um

7406
06:15:14,320 --> 06:15:21,638
and um I started uh right when I found

7407
06:15:17,680 --> 06:15:24,760
the book um and um it was no wonder that

7408
06:15:21,638 --> 06:15:26,798
I founded uh found it because um I was

7409
06:15:24,760 --> 06:15:29,760
suffering more than 35 years for more

7410
06:15:26,798 --> 06:15:32,520
than 35 years and I always was looking

7411
06:15:29,760 --> 06:15:34,558
for for information for help and nobody

7412
06:15:32,520 --> 06:15:37,520
could help me and uh I had this the

7413
06:15:34,558 --> 06:15:40,958
story as the most uh people in the mm

7414
06:15:37,520 --> 06:15:45,638
Community have have that um I tried

7415
06:15:40,958 --> 06:15:47,400
everything and um every every time I was

7416
06:15:45,638 --> 06:15:49,040
at the at the doctor's office they they

7417
06:15:47,400 --> 06:15:51,000
told me that my blood work is perfect

7418
06:15:49,040 --> 06:15:53,558
everything was perfect everything's fine

7419
06:15:51,000 --> 06:15:56,520
so it's just in your head and I knew

7420
06:15:53,558 --> 06:16:00,000
that it wasn't in my head and later on

7421
06:15:56,520 --> 06:16:03,280
when I was in my 40s then uh I started

7422
06:16:00,000 --> 06:16:06,120

I'm doing that because that's what

7458
06:17:58,878 --> 06:18:03,680
Anthony always told us uh that you have

7459
06:18:01,798 --> 06:18:06,638
to to walk in their shoes you have to

7460
06:18:03,680 --> 06:18:09,520
experience this only then you can

7461
06:18:06,638 --> 06:18:11,040
understand it's the only way so yeah and

7462
06:18:09,520 --> 06:18:12,760
that's so what's so great about these

7463
06:18:11,040 --> 06:18:14,718
events is connecting with other people

experience like with the light blast

7547
06:21:49,920 --> 06:21:56,478
tonight you know I felt it go through me

7548
06:21:53,200 --> 06:21:58,760
very quickly and he did it several times

7549
06:21:56,478 --> 06:22:01,160
and he said this was a very positive

7550
06:21:58,760 --> 06:22:04,680
atmosphere in the room and it it seemed

7551
06:22:01,160 --> 06:22:07,680
to flow it went easily and there's a

7552
06:22:04,680 --> 06:22:10,920
good vibe here and I think a lot of it

7553
06:22:07,680 --> 06:22:13,200
begins with the food at Cafe Gratitude

7554
06:22:10,920 --> 06:22:16,600
and it's good for your body it's healing

7555
06:22:13,200 --> 06:22:19,160
for your body it makes you feel better

7556
06:22:16,600 --> 06:22:21,478
and you know you're putting something

7557
06:22:19,160 --> 06:22:23,798
good into your body you don't have to

7558
06:22:21,478 --> 06:22:27,000
worry about preservatives or anything

7559
06:22:23,798 --> 06:22:29,680
like that it's soy free oil free

7560
06:22:27,000 --> 06:22:32,680
glutenfree and you know it contributes

7561
06:22:29,680 --> 06:22:35,240
to the positive vibing here and I think

7562
06:22:32,680 --> 06:22:37,040
the people come here with a good

7563
06:22:35,240 --> 06:22:40,600
attitude knowing they're going to be

7564
06:22:37,040 --> 06:22:43,680
taken care of physically mentally

7565
06:22:40,600 --> 06:22:45,760
emotionally and spiritually because

7566
06:22:43,680 --> 06:22:49,558
physically your body is going to feel

7567
06:22:45,760 --> 06:22:53,440
better mentally and emotionally you're

7568
06:22:49,558 --> 06:22:56,760
meeting people around you at your table

7569
06:22:53,440 --> 06:23:00,000

7577
06:23:18,878 --> 06:23:22,400
to leave everyone's swapping numbers

7578
06:23:20,600 --> 06:23:25,000
we're connecting with each other right

7579
06:23:22,400 --> 06:23:27,920
exactly and I met this wonderful woman

7580
06:23:25,000 --> 06:23:30,240
here from the east coast and she's going

7581
06:23:27,920 --> 06:23:34,200
back tomorrow and I met someone else

7582
06:23:30,240 --> 06:23:37,798
from just a few miles away and oh when I

7583
06:23:34,200 --> 06:23:40,920
first first came I met this person from

7584
06:23:37,798 --> 06:23:43,680
Europe that came here in December and it

7585
06:23:40,920 --> 06:23:46,000
was cancelled and he came and so he

7586
06:23:43,680 --> 06:23:47,798
stayed in La for a little while and then

7587
06:23:46,000 --> 06:23:50,798
he came back and he was able to get

7588
06:23:47,798 --> 06:23:53,400
tickets for today so you know it's an

7589
06:23:50,798 --> 06:23:56,920
allaround good feeling even though he

7590
06:23:53,400 --> 06:24:00,400
had a disappointment in December cuz or

7591
06:23:56,920 --> 06:24:03,000
or it was in January but then we had the

7592
06:24:00,400 --> 06:24:06,798
LA fires but you had to get your tickets

7593
06:24:03,000 --> 06:24:11,798
in December it's like going along with

7594
06:24:06,798 --> 06:24:14,400
the flow of life you know and it seems

7595
06:24:11,798 --> 06:24:17,878
like when you're in here you're in a

7596
06:24:14,400 --> 06:24:21,080
safe place and out there is the rest of

7597
06:24:17,878 --> 06:24:23,680

whatever it's going to be healing and

7612
06:24:57,320 --> 06:25:04,718
the fact that medical medium now has

7613
06:25:00,760 --> 06:25:08,400
some things on the menu that are his

7614
06:25:04,718 --> 06:25:13,920

7618
06:25:19,680 --> 06:25:24,320
here for everybody there were children

here tonight you know and that is such a

7620
06:25:24,320 --> 06:25:31,080
blessing that they are getting this

7621
06:25:26,558 --> 06:25:33,240
information at such an early age and

7622
06:25:31,080 --> 06:25:37,558
there was this 11-year-old girl that sat

7623
06:25:33,240 --> 06:25:43,040
next to me and we chatted and I said you

7624
06:25:37,558 --> 06:25:46,000
know if I had known this at age 11 my

7625
06:25:43,040 --> 06:25:48,958
life would have been totally different

7626
06:25:46,000 --> 06:25:52,520
it has to be if you're introduced to

7627
06:25:48,958 --> 06:25:56,080
this as a child you know your outlook on

7628
06:25:52,520 --> 06:25:58,280
life is different you know you're always

7629
06:25:56,080 --> 06:26:01,638
supported you know there's something

7630
06:25:58,280 --> 06:26:04,360
more in life and not just the physical

7631
06:26:01,638 --> 06:26:07,878
of what you see and you tend to have

7632
06:26:04,360 --> 06:26:09,878
more of a forgiving nature you know

7633
06:26:07,878 --> 06:26:11,558
there is so much empathy and compassion

7634
06:26:09,878 --> 06:26:15,160
and kindness in this community you can

7635
06:26:11,558 --> 06:26:19,200
really feel it yes yes and of course

7636
06:26:15,160 --> 06:26:21,240
it's it's something you pick up from uh

7637
06:26:19,200 --> 06:26:23,798
certain Healing Foods or if you're

7638
06:26:21,240 --> 06:26:26,600
drinking celery juice and and for

7639
06:26:23,798 --> 06:26:29,760
medical medium too because he

7640
06:26:26,600 --> 06:26:33,400
communicates with Spirit of compassion

7641
06:26:29,760 --> 06:26:35,638
so if we could all learn to have just at

7642
06:26:33,400 --> 06:26:38,320
least a little bit more compassion for

7643
06:26:35,638 --> 06:26:42,320
other people I know some people have a

7644
06:26:38,320 --> 06:26:45,680
very sharp tongue and some people are

7645
06:26:42,320 --> 06:26:48,878
quick to anger and some people want to

7646
06:26:45,680 --> 06:26:51,080
get back at you and there's all kinds of

7647
06:26:48,878 --> 06:26:54,000
feelings out there and if you're a

7648
06:26:51,080 --> 06:26:55,760
sensitive person you can tune into that

7649
06:26:54,000 --> 06:26:58,840
and so you

7650
06:26:55,760 --> 06:27:01,360
realize that they are human beings

7651
06:26:58,840 --> 06:27:04,638
having their experience so you don't

7652
06:27:01,360 --> 06:27:08,080
take it that personally and you you you

7653
06:27:04,638 --> 06:27:11,360
seem to have more compassion for them

7654
06:27:08,080 --> 06:27:15,840
cuz you're not drowning your body in a

7655
06:27:11,360 --> 06:27:17,878
lot of one thing unhealthy food I mean

7656
06:27:15,840 --> 06:27:19,798
sometimes we like to have a little bit

7657
06:27:17,878 --> 06:27:22,200
of

7658
06:27:19,798 --> 06:27:24,040
indulgence you know especially in the

7659
06:27:22,200 --> 06:27:26,440
summer like a little ice cream or

7660
06:27:24,040 --> 06:27:29,840
something but you know dairyfree ice

7661
06:27:26,440 --> 06:27:33,320
cream so it just makes me appreciate

7662
06:27:29,840 --> 06:27:34,760
people a lot more because you see each

7663
06:27:33,320 --> 06:27:38,400
person more

7664
06:27:34,760 --> 06:27:41,520
as an individual having their own

7665
06:27:38,400 --> 06:27:44,478
journey and they make mistakes and they

7666
06:27:41,520 --> 06:27:47,600
have love and they get angry and they

7667
06:27:44,478 --> 06:27:50,958
try to be a better person and it's all

7668
06:27:47,600 --> 06:27:52,680
part of life yes yes so I want to ask

7669
06:27:50,958 --> 06:27:54,680
you a little bit about your journey with

7670
06:27:52,680 --> 06:27:56,840
medical medium information what have you

7671
06:27:54,680 --> 06:28:00,638
healed from using this information what

7672
06:27:56,840 --> 06:28:02,958
have I healed I wish I could say there's

7673
06:28:00,638 --> 06:28:07,160
one thing that's totally healed and it's

7674
06:28:02,958 --> 06:28:08,798
great but not for me I'm healing a

7675
06:28:07,160 --> 06:28:10,600
little bit here and a little bit there

7676
06:28:08,798 --> 06:28:14,520
and a little bit here and a little bit

7677
06:28:10,600 --> 06:28:18,160
there and that's part of my journey so

7678
06:28:14,520 --> 06:28:20,638
there's no one big miracle like you know

7679
06:28:18,160 --> 06:28:23,958
I've read testimonials I've seen you

7680
06:28:20,638 --> 06:28:27,520
know videos of people that one person

7681
06:28:23,958 --> 06:28:31,080
healed 49 symptoms I mean come on that's

7682
06:28:27,520 --> 06:28:35,160
a lot of work but I think most of my

7683
06:28:31,080 --> 06:28:38,160
work has been internal just

7684
06:28:35,160 --> 06:28:41,080
um trying to have more compassion for

7685
06:28:38,160 --> 06:28:43,760
people and understanding them in a

7686
06:28:41,080 --> 06:28:46,920
different light than I would have 10

7687
06:28:43,760 --> 06:28:49,320
years ago for example or 20 years ago

7688
06:28:46,920 --> 06:28:52,120
and realizing that each person has their

7689
06:28:49,320 --> 06:28:54,760
own Journey so I think most of my

7690
06:28:52,120 --> 06:28:57,878
healing has been internal so I don't

7691
06:28:54,760 --> 06:29:01,478
even really see it it's not so much you

7692
06:28:57,878 --> 06:29:04,520
know the physical ailments so that I

7693
06:29:01,478 --> 06:29:06,440
think it's brought me a greater

7694
06:29:04,520 --> 06:29:08,920
understanding of human

7695
06:29:06,440 --> 06:29:11,400
nature and I think that's important cuz

7696
06:29:08,920 --> 06:29:15,160
I think you know we could all get along

7697
06:29:11,400 --> 06:29:17,320
better if we had more insight into

7698
06:29:15,160 --> 06:29:20,798
people and and their Journey we don't

7699
06:29:17,320 --> 06:29:23,760
have to be you know

7700
06:29:20,798 --> 06:29:26,680
professional people that are trained in

7701
06:29:23,760 --> 06:29:30,478
this you just have to remember you have

7702
06:29:26,680 --> 06:29:32,558
a heart and other people have a heart

7703
06:29:30,478 --> 06:29:34,440
and we're all going through our same

7704
06:29:32,558 --> 06:29:37,200
journey and I think that that's the

7705
06:29:34,440 --> 06:29:40,280
biggest gift that medical medium has

7706
06:29:37,200 --> 06:29:42,878
given me just being able to see things

7707
06:29:40,280 --> 06:29:45,600
in a different light well that's a huge

7708
06:29:42,878 --> 06:29:47,760
gift thank you well thank you so much

around medical medium I mean he's got a

7717
06:30:08,320 --> 06:30:16,280
lot of energy but he has so much depth

7718
06:30:12,798 --> 06:30:18,360
but he's very human and talks on a level

7719
06:30:16,280 --> 06:30:22,600

7735
06:30:57,558 --> 06:31:01,798
this time around because I had a light

7736
06:30:59,120 --> 06:31:04,600
blast yesterday it actually felt it felt

7737
06:31:01,798 --> 06:31:06,840
so easeful um

7738
06:31:04,600 --> 06:31:08,760
and I just feel afterwards I feel so

7739
06:31:06,840 --> 06:31:12,120
happy and I feel so light for the lack

7740
06:31:08,760 --> 06:31:15,240
of better word um and I always feel like

7741
06:31:12,120 --> 06:31:17,280
an immediate shift in my emotional state

7742
06:31:15,240 --> 06:31:19,000
and then further on I think in the days

7743
06:31:17,280 --> 06:31:22,440
to come I usually start feeling things

7744
06:31:19,000 --> 06:31:24,200
in my body um maybe certain symptoms or

7745
06:31:22,440 --> 06:31:26,478
certain discomforts that I have they

7746
06:31:24,200 --> 06:31:29,478
just fade away and so I'm I'm a big fan

7747
06:31:26,478 --> 06:31:31,600
of light blasts um whether in person or

7748
06:31:29,478 --> 06:31:33,958

most kind man I've ever met he just he

7754
06:31:44,798 --> 06:31:49,920

7755
06:31:47,638 --> 06:31:52,080
amazing to me how every single person

7756
06:31:49,920 --> 06:31:55,680
that comes up to him like he genuinely

7757
06:31:52,080 --> 06:31:58,360
cares about them and um it's it's such a

7758
06:31:55,680 --> 06:32:00,958

delicious and then I also really loved

7767
06:32:16,920 --> 06:32:23,200
the Mediterranean pizza the one with

7768
06:32:19,000 --> 06:32:27,200

7770
06:32:27,200 --> 06:32:30,600
think it's exciting that Cafe Gratitude

06:32:29,160 --> 06:32:32,840

7772
06:32:30,600 --> 06:32:34,638

7773
06:32:32,840 --> 06:32:36,958
cleanse options here

06:32:36,958 --> 06:32:40,120
honestly it feels like a dream come true

7776
06:32:38,440 --> 06:32:41,840
that there's a place there's a cafe you

7777
06:32:40,120 --> 06:32:43,398

7778
06:32:41,840 --> 06:32:46,240
about the food and you know you're

06:32:43,398 --> 06:32:48,360
getting really good quality Healing

7780
06:32:46,240 --> 06:32:50,680
Foods um I think it's beautiful I know

7781
06:32:48,360 --> 06:32:52,360
they also deliver to other cities in

7782
06:32:50,680 --> 06:32:54,320
California I don't know if they will be

7783
06:32:52,360 --> 06:32:55,840
delivering medical medium things but

7784
06:32:54,320 --> 06:32:58,240
fingers

7785
06:32:55,840 --> 06:33:02,360
crossed uh do you enjoy connecting with

7786
06:32:58,240 --> 06:33:03,878
the community here absolutely it's um

7787
06:33:02,360 --> 06:33:06,478
it's so beautiful I was just talking to

7788
06:33:03,878 --> 06:33:08,600
someone about it that every single

7789
06:33:06,478 --> 06:33:10,280
person is so kind like every single

7790
06:33:08,600 --> 06:33:13,160
person is someone you're so happy to

7791
06:33:10,280 --> 06:33:15,240
meet and I think maybe because of the

7792
06:33:13,160 --> 06:33:17,080
healing Journeys this all the community

7793
06:33:15,240 --> 06:33:19,120
has been through they're just the

7794
06:33:17,080 --> 06:33:21,478
kindest bunch and I've made so many

7795
06:33:19,120 --> 06:33:24,798
friends here already and it's just a

7796
06:33:21,478 --> 06:33:26,680
it's it feels like the best party ever

7797
06:33:24,798 --> 06:33:28,120
yes yes and what's your favorite piece

7798
06:33:26,680 --> 06:33:30,798
of medical medum

7799
06:33:28,120 --> 06:33:33,958
information that's a very hard question

7800
06:33:30,798 --> 06:33:37,040
I think the one that I site most often

7801
06:33:33,958 --> 06:33:39,718
to other people um is the piece about

7802
06:33:37,040 --> 06:33:41,080
the autoimmune diseases that um he says

7803
06:33:39,718 --> 06:33:42,958
that the body never really attacks

7804
06:33:41,080 --> 06:33:45,200
itself it's just a virus that we can

7805
06:33:42,958 --> 06:33:48,638
detect and I think to me when I first

7806
06:33:45,200 --> 06:33:50,558
read it um that maybe made me fall in

7807
06:33:48,638 --> 06:33:51,680
love with medical medium information

7808
06:33:50,558 --> 06:33:53,200
because it's something I never thought

7809
06:33:51,680 --> 06:33:54,878
about in that way before and it really

7810
06:33:53,200 --> 06:33:56,958
clicked for me like I really felt it in

7811
06:33:54,878 --> 06:33:58,760
my body that like it's not attacking me

7812
06:33:56,958 --> 06:34:01,798
it's not attacking itself it wants me to

7813
06:33:58,760 --> 06:34:04,878
heal so um I'd say that one but there's

7814
06:34:01,798 --> 06:34:06,798
so many that it's hard to yes yes what

7815
06:34:04,878 --> 06:34:09,120
have you hailed using medical medium

7816
06:34:06,798 --> 06:34:11,558
information um I'm one of the lucky ones

7817
06:34:09,120 --> 06:34:14,440
that started without severe symptoms in

7818
06:34:11,558 --> 06:34:17,440
2017 and then uh I got very deep into

7819
06:34:14,440 --> 06:34:19,440
medical medium in 2021 when I had for

7820
06:34:17,440 --> 06:34:22,760
about a year year and a half I had this

7821
06:34:19,440 --> 06:34:25,878
mystery neurological rash all over my

7822
06:34:22,760 --> 06:34:28,320
body um which had intense both like you

7823
06:34:25,878 --> 06:34:30,478
know rash symptoms and neurology and I

7824
06:34:28,320 --> 06:34:33,398
went to the regular doctors I got

7825
06:34:30,478 --> 06:34:36,398
biopsies I got tests I went to TCM

7826
06:34:33,398 --> 06:34:38,000
doctor s nobody knew what it was and I

7827
06:34:36,398 --> 06:34:40,718
start tried taking some allopathic

7828
06:34:38,000 --> 06:34:43,000
medicine and I just felt worse and um

7829
06:34:40,718 --> 06:34:45,920
then I did a medical medium cleanse and

7830
06:34:43,000 --> 06:34:47,638
it went away finally and uh I think that

7831
06:34:45,920 --> 06:34:50,398
was my breaking point where I was like

7832
06:34:47,638 --> 06:34:52,558
okay yeah this is this is what works and

7833
06:34:50,398 --> 06:34:55,798
I'm not dabbling anymore I'm you know

7834
06:34:52,558 --> 06:34:58,040
fully fully committed was that the 369

7835
06:34:55,798 --> 06:35:01,680
cleanse you did or the morning cleanse I

7836
06:34:58,040 --> 06:35:03,680
did um I did a 28 day cleanse and the

7837
06:35:01,680 --> 06:35:07,798
yeah the symptoms went away and then un

7838
06:35:03,680 --> 06:35:09,478
fortunately I got a medical treatment um

7839
06:35:07,798 --> 06:35:11,040
and it the symptoms came back and then I

7840
06:35:09,478 --> 06:35:13,120
did the same cleanse again and it went

7841
06:35:11,040 --> 06:35:15,600
away for good and then since then I've

7842
06:35:13,120 --> 06:35:18,840
been doing all all the cleanses uh and I

7843
06:35:15,600 --> 06:35:22,040
try to do them regularly and um there's

7844
06:35:18,840 --> 06:35:23,840
just so many symptoms that I didn't pay

7845
06:35:22,040 --> 06:35:25,920
very close attention to but they

7846
06:35:23,840 --> 06:35:27,760
improved like my mental my mental health

feel with tonight's light blast well

because I've had already many light

7938
06:39:19,360 --> 06:39:26,360
blast I feel like they just go right

7939
06:39:21,200 --> 06:39:28,120
through um but when I first got his

7940
06:39:26,360 --> 06:39:30,120
light blast in the beginning when he

7941
06:39:28,120 --> 06:39:33,398
first did the first one

7942
06:39:30,120 --> 06:39:36,558
um I could feel like it come and it's

7943
06:39:33,398 --> 06:39:39,120
stopped right here and then um when it

7944
06:39:36,558 --> 06:39:41,478
stopped right here I felt like I wanted

7945
06:39:39,120 --> 06:39:45,280
to throw something out of my

7946
06:39:41,478 --> 06:39:47,040
mouth and um and then you know he did it

7947
06:39:45,280 --> 06:39:49,558
again and then I kind of felt it stop

7948
06:39:47,040 --> 06:39:51,398
again and then after you know he did a

7949
06:39:49,558 --> 06:39:53,478
couple more and then it felt it go right

7950
06:39:51,398 --> 06:39:55,878
through um but that was my experience

7951
06:39:53,478 --> 06:39:57,398
with the first light blast definitely it

7952
06:39:55,878 --> 06:39:59,718
hit me right here in the chest and it

7953
06:39:57,398 --> 06:40:03,558
stopped and then cuz you know how he

7954
06:39:59,718 --> 06:40:05,798
says hold your breath so I was like like

7955
06:40:03,558 --> 06:40:08,558
something wanted to like come out and

7956
06:40:05,798 --> 06:40:11,120

06:40:49,798 --> 06:40:55,680

7981
06:41:12,638 --> 06:41:19,558

7988
06:41:31,240 --> 06:41:36,398
Instagram and then from from there I

7989
06:41:34,398 --> 06:41:38,798
wasn't paying much attention to the post

7990
06:41:36,398 --> 06:41:40,478
though I was just following him but she

7991
06:41:38,798 --> 06:41:42,878
kept telling me are you drinking celery

7992
06:41:40,478 --> 06:41:44,680
juice when I would see her because my

7993
06:41:42,878 --> 06:41:47,798
son and her son were in the same

7994
06:41:44,680 --> 06:41:49,080
classroom and then I'd be like uh yeah

7995
06:41:47,798 --> 06:41:51,200
yeah I'm I'm going get on it I'm going

7996
06:41:49,080 --> 06:41:54,398
to get on it and then um I finally got

7997
06:41:51,200 --> 06:41:57,600
on it and it was helping me and then I

7998
06:41:54,398 --> 06:42:00,558
kind of fell off and then I became

7999
06:41:57,600 --> 06:42:01,478
really sick again and then I started it

8000
06:42:00,558 --> 06:42:05,160
back

8001
06:42:01,478 --> 06:42:07,080
up and then after after that I she

8002
06:42:05,160 --> 06:42:09,280
tagged me on a healing

8003
06:42:07,080 --> 06:42:11,600
story because I had been diagnosed with

8004
06:42:09,280 --> 06:42:14,558
Barett esophagus and they had told me

8005
06:42:11,600 --> 06:42:16,478
there was no cure and so she tagged me

8006
06:42:14,558 --> 06:42:19,360
on a healing story that someone had

8007
06:42:16,478 --> 06:42:22,520
healed barit esophagus so then I started

8008
06:42:19,360 --> 06:42:25,080
following them and I started copying

8009
06:42:22,520 --> 06:42:26,760
everything they were doing on Instagram

8010
06:42:25,080 --> 06:42:28,878
and I started

8011
06:42:26,760 --> 06:42:31,478
recovering and but I hadn't read the

8012
06:42:28,878 --> 06:42:33,878
books I was just copying whatever this

8013
06:42:31,478 --> 06:42:37,280
girl did I was doing it and I started

8014
06:42:33,878 --> 06:42:39,440
healing and I told someone else about

8015
06:42:37,280 --> 06:42:40,840
medical medium and then they came back

8016
06:42:39,440 --> 06:42:43,040
to me and they were like oh I bought his

8017
06:42:40,840 --> 06:42:46,320
book and then I was like wait I need to

8018
06:42:43,040 --> 06:42:49,240
get the books myself and then I started

8019
06:42:46,320 --> 06:42:52,320
you know reading the information and it

8020
06:42:49,240 --> 06:42:53,958
started making so much sense and yeah

8021
06:42:52,320 --> 06:42:55,760
that's how it happened you know what's

8022
06:42:53,958 --> 06:42:57,478
interesting to me is the fact that uh

8023
06:42:55,760 --> 06:43:00,120
you heard this story of someone else who

8024
06:42:57,478 --> 06:43:01,558
was going through a similar dealing with

8025
06:43:00,120 --> 06:43:05,200
a similar condition or the same

8026
06:43:01,558 --> 06:43:07,398
condition and that inspired you you were

8027
06:43:05,200 --> 06:43:10,798
seeing their healing Journey it inspired

8028
06:43:07,398 --> 06:43:14,878
you with your healing Journey CU I I was

8029
06:43:10,798 --> 06:43:17,840
already dying and I needed like I just

8030
06:43:14,878 --> 06:43:22,080
saw that if she did it then it had to

8031
06:43:17,840 --> 06:43:24,240
help me I had nothing else I had nothing

8032
06:43:22,080 --> 06:43:25,920
else so by that person sharing the

8033
06:43:24,240 --> 06:43:28,120
healing Journey you were inspired and

8034
06:43:25,920 --> 06:43:29,798
it's just now taking me to this moment

8035
06:43:28,120 --> 06:43:31,478
where you're brave enough to open up and

8036
06:43:29,798 --> 06:43:33,840
share your healing Journey you don't

8037
06:43:31,478 --> 06:43:35,440
know who you might may be inspiring out

8038
06:43:33,840 --> 06:43:38,200
there as well it's really incredible

8039
06:43:35,440 --> 06:43:42,160
yeah so yeah it's incredible what

8040
06:43:38,200 --> 06:43:45,600
Instagram can do and what people share

8041
06:43:42,160 --> 06:43:48,160
as in what they do dayto day you know

8042
06:43:45,600 --> 06:43:50,878
how others can be looking at it and

8043
06:43:48,160 --> 06:43:53,638
applying it applying it in their life um

8044
06:43:50,878 --> 06:43:55,240
so it's powerful what people share in

8045
06:43:53,638 --> 06:43:57,558
their Instagrams and their stories and

8046
06:43:55,240 --> 06:43:59,520
their posts because people are looking

8047
06:43:57,558 --> 06:44:01,360
and people are doing it at home even if

8048
06:43:59,520 --> 06:44:04,798
they might not tell you or you might

8049
06:44:01,360 --> 06:44:08,120

8050
06:44:04,798 --> 06:44:09,798

06:44:08,120 --> 06:44:12,398

improvements have you noticed um okay so

8053
06:44:12,398 --> 06:44:17,120
when I started medical medium because

8054
06:44:14,718 --> 06:44:19,478
it's going to be 4 years now the first

8055
06:44:17,120 --> 06:44:22,718
thing that cleared up for me was my

8056
06:44:19,478 --> 06:44:25,600
toenail fungus like it was gone within

8057
06:44:22,718 --> 06:44:27,638
like months it was gone after I started

8058
06:44:25,600 --> 06:44:30,200
medical medium I never got another cold

8059
06:44:27,638 --> 06:44:33,280
sore which I would get like one or twice

8060
06:44:30,200 --> 06:44:36,558
every year and we know that that is like

8061
06:44:33,280 --> 06:44:38,798
in a lowered immune system and so I was

8062
06:44:36,558 --> 06:44:42,200
feeding my immune system with all those

8063
06:44:38,798 --> 06:44:48,520
foods and then I got rid of my

8064
06:44:42,200 --> 06:44:50,880
gastritis um and um just dry eyes I had

8065
06:44:48,520 --> 06:44:52,398
