[0.32 - 3.80] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.24 - 5.76] listening to the medical medium radio
[3.80 - 7.48] show where each week I talk about the
[5.76 - 9.48] most advanced healing information and
[7.48 - 12.92] secrets about health much of which is
[9.48 - 14.48] not found anywhere else and is decades
[12.92 - 16.88] ahead of what's out there now as I've
[14.48 - 20.20] always said who is 10 or 20 or 30 years
[16.88 - 21.44] to wait for answers to their illnesses
[20.20 - 24.36] to their
[21.44 - 27.16] symptoms and life is precious I mean you
[24.36 - 29.80] know that uh I know that you know that
[27.16 - 31.56] we know that there's no time to spare so
[29.80 - 34.76] let's let get into the healing now
[31.56 - 37.60] Today's Show is part two of the
[34.76 - 40.96] addiction series we can call it a series
[37.60 - 43.28] I guess but it's part two okay so and
[40.96 - 45.52] that means if you're you know into the
[43.28 - 47.80] show I mean you you need to you need to
[45.52 - 49.44] get the other show or or or listen to
[47.80 - 52.40] the other show is what I'm saying got to
[49.44 - 54.32] go back if you missed it last week but
[52.40 - 56.60] this is part two of addiction the reason
[54.32 - 58.92] why it's part two is because even though
[56.60 - 61.76] we did practically a full hour on
[58.92 - 63.96] information about addictions and and
[61.76 - 66.84] being addicted and in the whole bit even
[63.96 - 69.32] though we did that um there's so much to
[66.84 - 72.08] cover there really is to do it justice
[69.32 - 75.36] look any show I've ever done probably
[72.08 - 77.76] needs four shows four shows for that
[75.36 - 78.96] topic and I do one show and they say hey
[77.76 - 80.84] look we're going to do another one
[78.96 - 83.72] another day down the road and it's true
[80.84 - 85.56] because I I have done started to do a
[83.72 - 88.20] couple of shows and and getting into
[85.56 - 90.16] them more uh topics that we've done in
[88.20 - 92.08] the older shows and getting into getting
[90.16 - 94.76] into it more with more information about
[92.08 - 98.04] it all so that's true but addiction is
[94.76 - 100.68] the kind of thing where it just felt
[98.04 - 102.84] look I I feel the addiction of wanting
[100.68 - 105.12] to get part two done of getting the
[102.84 - 108.36] information out now and not
[105.12 - 110.16] waiting uh um four months or six months
[108.36 - 112.16] or eight months or a year something like
[110.16 - 114.08] that whatever it is you know hey it's
[112.16 - 115.24] like an addiction to do this show no I'm
[114.08 - 118.00] just kidding there but you know what I
[115.24 - 120.56] mean I have to get this done so we have
[118.00 - 122.24] that information in our hands because
[120.56 - 124.76] when it comes down to addiction it's no
[122.24 - 126.84] joke I mean look the smallest addictions
[124.76 - 128.88] and I said this before in the in in the
[126.84 - 130.92] last show the smallest ones can be
[128.88 - 132.56] really hard and there's a lot of
[130.92 - 135.80] different small ones but there's some
[132.56 - 138.56] really heavy duty big ones and there's
[135.80 - 141.44] nothing wrong with you know catching the
[138.56 - 144.00] small ones seeing seeing them sometimes
[141.44 - 146.92] for what they are because it can stop us
[144.00 - 149.44] from getting into a big one you know
[146.92 - 153.20] some of the things that I offer um in
[149.44 - 155.76] the last show and this show help us
[153.20 - 158.24] battle you know and get help us battle
[155.76 - 160.32] that addiction or it's going to help us
[158.24 - 161.96] break away from not getting in trouble
[160.32 - 163.40] deeper into an addiction that's a whole
[161.96 - 166.44] another thing because here's here's the
[163.40 - 170.08] here's how it works with addictions it
[166.44 - 173.08] takes everything you got anything you
[170.08 - 176.44] can get everywhere you can get it
[173.08 - 179.80] percentage wise 5% support here 5%
[176.44 - 181.36] support here 5% support here because it
[179.80 - 182.52] matters it could stop you from going
[181.36 - 185.32] back to a drug
[182.52 - 186.88] rehab and it it can it can because if
[185.32 - 189.64] you don't have that support the problem
[186.88 - 191.56] is when we're deep into addictions or we
[189.64 - 195.28] have small addictions whatever it could
[191.56 - 197.72] be there's this breaking point and we
[195.28 - 199.40] just break we're just like okay that's
[197.72 - 202.12] it you know that's that's the point I've
[199.40 - 205.20] seen it for years for with people and
[202.12 - 208.64] they break and they fall victim you know
[205.20 - 212.16] they fall into it and if there was just
[208.64 - 214.40] 5% more of support in this area or this
[212.16 - 215.48] area or something they're eating that
[214.40 - 217.76] could
[215.48 - 219.52] actually you know throw off that
[217.76 - 222.08] addiction just enough where they have
[219.52 - 226.12] enough Inner Strength or spiritually
[222.08 - 228.08] speaking just enough spiritually just
[226.12 - 230.64] there for them a little bit of spiritual
[228.08 - 235.48] wisdom something that gives the other 8%
[230.64 - 238.32] other 2% other 9% and stops The Fallout
[235.48 - 240.32] and stops The Fallout so from the nasty
[238.32 - 242.52] happening where oh my God now back into
[240.32 - 244.96] this whole addictive behavior again and
[242.52 - 248.68] I can't seem to swim out of it every
[244.96 - 250.84] little bit counts in part one I covered
[248.68 - 252.56] a lot of stuff on on these two big
[250.84 - 255.04] groups one is
[252.56 - 257.96] adrenaline okay and the other one
[255.04 - 260.56] glucose the reason why when you're aware
[257.96 - 262.04] of glucose deficiencies and I talked
[260.56 - 265.28] about that part one when you're aware of
[262.04 - 267.56] glucose deficiencies you can literally
[265.28 - 269.20] stop yourself from falling into whatever
[267.56 - 272.00] addiction you might be heading into
[269.20 - 275.16] whatever might be and if you're aware of
[272.00 - 279.08] how adrenaline plays the role or plays a
[275.16 - 281.04] role into addiction you can be aware of
[279.08 - 282.92] it and be like whoa wait a minute I'm
[281.04 - 285.52] getting an adrenaline high right now and
[282.92 - 288.20] that adrenaline high is leading me to oh
[285.52 - 292.48] G to grab some drug or grab that alcohol
[288.20 - 295.84] or grab that candy whatever it may be so
[292.48 - 298.60] this is really an important show um hey
[295.84 - 299.84] you know and and on on another note by

[342.20 - 347.64] that's something also Instagram we put
[344.64 - 349.08] stories everybody's stories on Instagram
[347.64 - 350.36] you know it's not just the Instagram
[349.08 - 351.84] where you get this little pick and it's
[350.36 - 354.24] cute and it's a couple words you know we
[351.84 - 356.08] have a we have some of those too and
[354.24 - 357.52] there's nothing wrong with that because
[356.08 - 358.92] if you only have two seconds and you're
[357.52 - 360.72] flipping through social media and you're
[358.92 - 364.56] like oh yeah that's cute oh that's great
[360.72 - 367.12] or whatever it is fine but what we do on
[364.56 - 368.52] Instagram is we put stories okay they
[367.12 - 370.28] they people struggles what they've gone
[368.52 - 372.48] through their healing process them
[370.28 - 374.80] getting better what's going on with the
[372.48 - 376.48] you know the medical medium books how
[374.80 - 379.32] people are into the medical medium books
[376.48 - 381.00] and how they're changing people's lives
[379.32 - 382.56] you might be one of them you might know
[381.00 - 384.40] just by you know hearing this and being
[382.56 - 386.80] like hey I'm one of them and if you're
[384.40 - 388.64] not there yet you'll get there one step
[386.80 - 391.68] at a time well actually it's three steps
[388.64 - 393.68] up to two steps back okay three steps up
[391.68 - 396.16] two steps back that means that's the
[393.68 - 398.60] healing process because when you're
[396.16 - 400.64] healing your body's doing all kinds of
[398.60 - 402.16] miraculous things all kinds of
[400.64 - 403.76] phytochemicals are moving through your
[402.16 - 406.24] body and all kinds of different healing
[403.76 - 408.32] energies are happening within the body
[406.24 - 411.52] and your immune systems recalibrating
[408.32 - 414.64] constantly as you defeat defeat the
[411.52 - 416.76] Epstein bar viruses you beat down some
[414.64 - 418.48] kind of bacteria as you beat down some
[416.76 - 421.32] other toxin or some other viral
[418.48 - 423.80] component and that's how the body
[421.32 - 426.84] mysteriously Works always remember
[423.80 - 429.08] that's a three steps up two steps back
[426.84 - 432.20] um a little bit about me I was given a
[429.08 - 433.88] gift uh at since I was and not a not a
[432.20 - 435.96] little Christmas present not a birthday
[433.88 - 438.76] present wasn't given that kind it was
[435.96 - 441.20] wrapped with a bow and it was had paper
[438.76 - 445.24] and it was for my birthday no it was
[441.20 - 447.32] given a gift um from God um of of
[445.24 - 449.16] hearing a voice perfectly clear someone
[447.32 - 453.92] said to me well are you hearing God no
[449.16 - 457.36] I'm not um I wish I was you've read my
[453.92 - 459.32] first book I wanted to talk to God so
[457.36 - 461.96] bad and hear God but instead I was
[459.32 - 464.12] hearing what um what has been introduced
[461.96 - 468.48] to me since a child as Spirit of the
[464.12 - 470.44] most high and spirit I call Spirit was
[468.48 - 472.80] speaking to me at age four told me my
[470.44 - 475.52] grandmother had lung cancer when nobody
[472.80 - 477.40] knew and and ever since then it's it was
[475.52 - 480.28] every single day after that I had the
[477.40 - 483.36] sight to see and hear what was happening
[480.28 - 485.20] with People's Health but in in book one
[483.36 - 488.40] in the first chapter origins of the
[485.20 - 490.56] medical medium I talk about you know my
[488.40 - 493.00] struggle with hearing the voice and
[490.56 - 494.84] wanting to cut out that voice get
[493.00 - 496.56] getting rid of that voice because I hear
[494.84 - 498.72] it from the outside of the body not the
[496.56 - 500.84] in in inside so I have no control the
[498.72 - 503.08] voice is just always there as if
[500.84 - 506.36] someone's talking to you uh perfectly
[503.08 - 507.72] clear and hearing that voice you know
[506.36 - 509.32] was always telling me what people's
[507.72 - 510.92] struggles and their conditions and
[509.32 - 513.76] what's happening with what's going on in
[510.92 - 515.84] their Li lives and it was tiring it was
[513.76 - 517.88] tiring as a child and I could honestly
[515.84 - 520.28] say sometimes it still beats me down to
[517.88 - 523.44] today so I I stay out of crowds as much
[520.28 - 526.28] as I can but what I will tell you though
[523.44 - 527.92] is I wanted to talk directly to God I
[526.28 - 530.76] you know I I wanted to cut out the
[527.92 - 532.56] middleman which was spirit and I wanted
[530.76 - 536.56] God to speak to me and hear God
[532.56 - 539.76] perfectly clear and you know and even
[536.56 - 542.08] though I was told by spirit that the
[539.76 - 544.40] gift obviously came from God I couldn't
[542.08 - 546.80] hear God and that was really difficult
[544.40 - 549.92] really difficult I'm telling telling you
[546.80 - 551.40] a little bit about my gift um because a
[549.92 - 553.88] well first of all I don't really talk
[551.40 - 557.68] about it that much or go into detail too
[553.88 - 559.48] many times but I'm talking because look
[557.68 - 561.72] you know when we're in addictions and
[559.48 - 565.44] we're deep into addictions and we feel
[561.72 - 567.68] hopeless and we feel lost oh I realize
[565.44 - 571.00] having a voice talk to you could be a
[567.68 - 573.76] great way to pull you out of it and
[571.00 - 576.48] that's true and that's true and I and
[573.76 - 580.16] and but with when it comes down to
[576.48 - 584.08] addictions having information can
[580.16 - 586.08] replace sometimes not having that voice
[584.08 - 588.84] so I might have been given a gift that
[586.08 - 591.32] tells me hey don't eat that Anthony
[588.84 - 593.84] don't do this it doesn't mean I I won't
[591.32 - 595.92] though I've been known to to especially
[593.84 - 598.36] as a child known to go against spirit
[595.92 - 601.84] and do what I wanted to do you know make
[598.36 - 605.28] my way espe ly through a teenager and um
[601.84 - 606.92] but but regardless you know I still have
[605.28 - 609.28] that voice that says don't do that
[606.92 - 611.72] that's stupid
[609.28 - 616.60] don't don't do that that's not g to help
[611.72 - 619.04] you and but what happens is that uh when
[616.60 - 621.36] we when we go through life we don't have
[619.04 - 623.84] that voice it's hard to get it so we
[621.36 - 626.20] seek it through counselors and you know
[623.84 - 629.60] helpers in different ways and and you
[626.20 - 631.56] know spiritual support in different ways
[629.60 - 634.16] and we we seek it in these different
[631.56 - 637.52] ways and you know it can be re really
[634.16 - 639.32] helpful and you know and and so much but
[637.52 - 642.48] but more than that because a lot of
[639.32 - 646.24] people they they tend to you know they
[642.48 - 648.24] tend to shy away from um help with their
[646.24 - 650.68] addictions we know that they tend to
[648.24 - 651.68] turn away from it I you might know you
[650.68 - 654.80] might have done that you might have
[651.68 - 657.04] known someone who who's done that and
[654.80 - 661.16] you know when it happens sometimes
[657.04 - 664.04] information you hear from other sources
[661.16 - 668.60] and in other books or any sources can
[664.04 - 671.88] can stick and resonate and hold and hold
[668.60 - 676.44] true and that information kind of
[671.88 - 679.80] replaces that inability to hear a voice
[676.44 - 682.48] perfectly clear in the ear like I do and
[679.80 - 684.84] so that's why this is important this is
[682.48 - 687.56] really important to know information to
[684.84 - 689.48] be armed with it to have a shield of
[687.56 - 691.40] with it a shield of it
[689.48 - 693.68] to to protect you to help protect you no
[691.40 - 696.84] matter what no matter what illness as
[693.68 - 700.08] well illness disease symptom whatever's
[696.84 - 702.68] happening whatever diagnosis you've had
[700.08 - 705.72] regardless it's good to have information
[702.68 - 708.72] it can sometimes and many times be that
[705.72 - 712.84] freeing moment be that
[708.72 - 714.16] voice and it matters you know and look
[712.84 - 716.92] I've been getting I've been the
[714.16 - 718.52] messenger of information from Spirit and
[716.92 - 722.36] providing that for everybody so so we
[718.52 - 724.40] can all get a a a piece of spirit the
[722.36 - 726.44] the spirit that I hear you know we all
[724.40 - 729.96] have spirit in us we all have you know
[726.44 - 731.44] we all have that that will to survive we
[729.96 - 733.92] all have connection spiritually in
[731.44 - 737.36] different ways and we all have our
[733.92 - 743.36] connection to God but in the way I hear
[737.36 - 745.88] it I like to offer that in any way I can
[743.36 - 747.24] um the healing path is one way the radio
[745.88 - 749.56] shows are another and the books of
[747.24 - 752.36] course and anything I can do
[749.56 - 754.40] um for everybody so so that's what it's
[752.36 - 756.44] about so that's why we're here so I want
[754.40 - 758.12] to go now into we're going to go now
[756.44 - 760.28] into the whole heaviness of this the
[758.12 - 764.32] lightness of it you name it that's where
[760.28 - 768.44] we're starting now um so that's the plan
[764.32 - 772.28] okay so I talked about adrenaline a lot
[768.44 - 775.44] in the last show in part one and but
[772.28 - 778.00] what I didn't Express or tell you is
[775.44 - 783.44] that adrenaline itself is highly
[778.00 - 787.28] addictive it is a drug it is such a drug
[783.44 - 790.76] and so when we do things that are
[787.28 - 793.68] adrenaline induced we get just as
[790.76 - 797.04] addicted and sometimes more addicted to
[793.68 - 802.24] the adren adrenaline
[797.04 - 804.80] surges more so than the substance more
[802.24 - 806.92] so than the candy more so than the
[804.80 - 810.20] alcohol more so than the cigarettes more
[806.92 - 813.28] so than the coffee coffee
[810.20 - 815.64] yeah that's right coffee all right more
[813.28 - 817.44] so than you know the
[815.64 - 820.04] chocolate and I'm going to talk about
[817.44 - 822.16] chocolate in a positive way a little bit
[820.04 - 824.12] too not in just a negative way by saying
[822.16 - 825.88] look you know it could be a an addiction
[824.12 - 829.00] I just know so many people with nervous
[825.88 - 830.52] system issues neurological symptoms and
[829.00 - 832.48] neurological problems that if they eat
[830.52 - 834.96] chocolate they get they literally
[832.48 - 838.32] they're shaking they're shaking cuz
[834.96 - 840.92] chocolate is is so neuro based I mean
[838.32 - 842.52] it's B basically it's basically got some
[840.92 - 844.00] neurotoxins in it as many health
[842.52 - 846.20] benefits as it has in it it's got
[844.00 - 848.48] neurotoxins in it I always say look if
[846.20 - 850.08] you're really healthy and you feel great
[848.48 - 851.60] and you don't have any confusion and you
[850.08 - 853.88] don't have any brain fog and you don't
[851.60 - 856.12] have any neurological shakes and you
[853.88 - 858.28] don't have any Tremors and you don't
[856.12 - 860.24] have any neurological pains and aches
[858.28 - 861.76] and pains and stuff you could yeah I eat
[860.24 - 866.08] chocolate it's got some health benefits
[861.76 - 869.20] I'm sure packed in there but if you're
[866.08 - 871.76] anywhere neurologically speaking at all
[869.20 - 874.76] I would probably stay away from it now
[871.76 - 878.80] the one thing I like about chocolate is
[874.76 - 880.28] um for real addicts that are on opiates
[878.80 - 881.96] and they're they're stuck you know
[880.28 - 883.52] they're they're stuck on oxies or
[881.96 - 885.16] they're see with a prescription or
[883.52 - 888.68] whether that's street drugs or whatever
[885.16 - 891.56] it is and they're really in deep and
[888.68 - 893.76] whatever kind of drugs they're doing um
[891.56 - 897.68] you know prescription nonprescription
[893.76 - 899.56] whatever is going on um what happens is
[897.68 - 904.04] chocolate can be really helpful it could
[899.56 - 905.20] be one of that 5% 5% tool that I'm
[904.04 - 909.08] talking about CU you need all these
[905.20 - 913.32] different percentages that 5% tool to
[909.08 - 917.44] actually stop you from caving on an
[913.32 - 920.08] opioid caving on you know a drug caving
[917.44 - 922.16] on a you know street drug pharmaceutical
[920.08 - 923.96] whatever and of course you need the
[922.16 - 925.44] rehab when you're in when you're in on
[923.96 - 927.32] the drugs really heavy you need the
[925.44 - 929.36] rehabs we know that you need to seek out
[927.32 - 931.00] rehab you need to seek out support you
[929.36 - 932.72] need family members supporting you we
[931.00 - 934.68] know the whole thing you guys know about
[932.72 - 936.92] it probably through experiences or just
[934.68 - 940.48] anything you've read or learned or seen
[936.92 - 942.48] even on television but and and you know
[940.48 - 946.04] I've seen I've seen people I've worked
[942.48 - 947.92] with people in some dire situations and
[946.04 - 950.76] a secret one of the secret weapons if
[947.92 - 952.12] someone's actually dry you know they're
[950.76 - 953.52] actually dry they're off the wagget I
[952.12 - 954.88] mean they're on the wagon however you
[953.52 - 957.60] want to say and they're
[954.88 - 962.68] clean chocolate can be helpful
[957.60 - 966.44] periodically it can be a way to curve or
[962.68 - 969.48] or stop someone from going onto back
[966.44 - 970.96] onto a a heavy drug or heavy addiction
[969.48 - 972.56] so that's the one positive thing I
[970.96 - 977.72] really like about chocolate I remember
[972.56 - 981.40] back 25 years ago in my office 25 years
[977.72 - 984.84] ago in my office okay I had a stack of
[981.40 - 986.68] chocolate bars the dark stuff you know
[984.84 - 990.16] just it had sugar in it had the cane
[986.68 - 992.40] sugar was like 69% or something or 70%
[990.16 - 994.16] right caca the whole bid and it was
[992.40 - 997.04] wasn't a raw chocolate it was a cooked
[994.16 - 999.84] chocolate it was a bar all right and I
[997.04 - 1002.00] had these bars because Spirit taught me
[999.84 - 1003.88] that these chocolate bars can save
[1002.00 - 1006.00] someone's life if it's the right person
[1003.88 - 1009.56] at the right time that's what I was told
[1006.00 - 1011.32] by spirit all right so those chocolate
[1009.56 - 1012.76] bars were off limits to all the sick
[1011.32 - 1015.08] people that came into my office to see
[1012.76 - 1017.52] me every day 25 years ago okay that were
[1015.08 - 1020.20] lined up and I mean they were lined up I
[1017.52 - 1022.36] was working seven days a week s days a
[1020.20 - 1027.40] week and I was working for free by the
[1022.36 - 1029.96] way free I never charged I never charged
[1027.40 - 1033.12] until a dear close friend said you're
[1029.96 - 1035.88] going to starve to death okay I had no
[1033.12 - 1037.64] car insurance I lost my car because I
[1035.88 - 1040.72] wouldn't charge I had to live in the
[1037.64 - 1042.64] office and I refused to charge but I was
[1040.72 - 1045.80] dissolving because I couldn't even get
[1042.64 - 1049.52] food or pay a bill and I
[1045.80 - 1051.36] remember so you know 25 years ago I had
[1049.52 - 1055.76] people lined up and they were coming in
[1051.36 - 1057.60] droves and if if anybody had a symptom
[1055.76 - 1060.84] that was neurological in any way whether
[1057.60 - 1063.60] it's depression or anxiety or aches and
[1060.84 - 1065.84] pains the whole bit those big stack of
[1063.60 - 1067.72] chocolate bars they were off limit off
[1065.84 - 1069.52] limits that's right because that was
[1067.72 - 1071.00] just going to neurotoxic break them down
[1069.52 - 1072.32] make them sicker eventually even if they
[1071.00 - 1075.48] got a high off of it and they felt a
[1072.32 - 1079.16] little better but let me tell you
[1075.48 - 1081.92] something okay I remember a
[1079.16 - 1085.00] 19-year-old uh boy came in with his
[1081.92 - 1086.72] mother and father all right and he was
[1085.00 - 1088.48] addicted to street drugs he was addicted
[1086.72 - 1089.80] to you know some kind of oxy or
[1088.48 - 1090.96] something like that I don't know what it
[1089.80 - 1092.28] was back then I think but it was
[1090.96 - 1094.92] definitely an opioid it was it could
[1092.28 - 1098.12] have been you know could have been one
[1094.92 - 1100.32] of it was one of those and he was
[1098.12 - 1103.88] addicted severely they went in and out
[1100.32 - 1108.44] of rehab in and out of rehab constantly
[1103.88 - 1110.64] the whole bit and he wasn't he wasn't
[1108.44 - 1114.20] surviving this they came in out of
[1110.64 - 1116.80] despera trity all right and spirit said
[1114.20 - 1119.68] immediately the chocolate bars the
[1116.80 - 1122.48] chocolate bars I said
[1119.68 - 1124.00] ah these were big they weren't like the
[1122.48 - 1125.92] kind you get in the you know the health
[1124.00 - 1128.20] food store they you know the ones that
[1125.92 - 1130.56] are only like 6 inches or 8 inches long
[1128.20 - 1132.60] this was the big one it was like a foot
[1130.56 - 1135.56] long kind of like the foot long hot
[1132.60 - 1138.08] dogs you know it was like six or eight
[1135.56 - 1140.08] inches you know wide or whatever it was
[1138.08 - 1143.68] one of these and it was high quality
[1140.08 - 1146.00] stuff and and you know had them stacked
[1143.68 - 1147.36] I pulled the chocolate bar off the off
[1146.00 - 1149.76] the thing and I said this is going to be
[1147.36 - 1151.16] your weapon that's what I said I said
[1149.76 - 1153.44] spirit says this is going to be your
[1151.16 - 1155.60] weapon and the parents looked at me and
[1153.44 - 1157.40] they said we're open to it because we're
[1155.60 - 1160.24] desperate we've we've been through hell
[1157.40 - 1163.56] and back we're losing our lives because
[1160.24 - 1166.80] of this and because our son is losing
[1163.56 - 1169.60] his life and he said yeah I said I said
[1166.80 - 1171.56] you're you're you're you're weaning down
[1169.60 - 1173.68] off your drugs you know you're working
[1171.56 - 1175.92] with your your doctors on that you're
[1173.68 - 1177.92] working on that whole thing I said but I
[1175.92 - 1180.16] want you I want when you feel like
[1177.92 - 1182.04] you're going insane and you're and
[1180.16 - 1183.84] you're really struggling through that
[1182.04 - 1185.48] weaning process at different times I
[1183.84 - 1187.16] want you to start eating a hunk of this
[1185.48 - 1189.28] chocolate and I don't mean like a little
[1187.16 - 1191.88] bite I mean a hunk of this
[1189.28 - 1194.00] chocolate you know I remember he he
[1191.88 - 1195.84] looked at me I said look have a little
[1194.00 - 1197.48] piece now I opened it up broke off a
[1195.84 - 1199.92] piece and he and he was eating and he
[1197.48 - 1202.80] said this is really good this is really
[1199.92 - 1204.80] good and he smiled and his and and his
[1202.80 - 1207.96] parents said it was the first time he
[1204.80 - 1210.04] smiled in years couldn't even get a
[1207.96 - 1213.60] smile out of him the first time he
[1210.04 - 1216.24] smiled his name was Cole so Cole started
[1213.60 - 1218.36] eating a piece and he smiled and he
[1216.24 - 1220.96] looked at me and he said you know what
[1218.36 - 1224.04] this this this can work I said you feel
[1220.96 - 1225.36] it can work he said this can work and
[1224.04 - 1227.40] the parents said I've never heard him
[1225.36 - 1230.16] even say anything like that ever
[1227.40 - 1233.32] throughout this whole Str process and he
[1230.16 - 1237.72] said this could work and guess what it
[1233.32 - 1241.08] did he was clean in fact he literally
[1237.72 - 1244.48] weaned off rapidly off of the off the uh
[1241.08 - 1248.44] the opioids with with the doctor rapidly
[1244.48 - 1251.36] okay not only that but he was knowing
[1248.44 - 1254.32] how to self-medicate with the chocolate
[1251.36 - 1257.96] he was free from it his drug addiction
[1254.32 - 1259.64] in 3 weeks three weeks never touched it
[1257.96 - 1263.00] again again how do I know I stayed in
[1259.64 - 1266.64] contact with them for years years after
[1263.00 - 1269.68] that one reason why is because they
[1266.64 - 1273.48] helped me out too is the parents said
[1269.68 - 1275.96] why are you in this office here with you
[1273.48 - 1278.28] know not able to eat not able to do
[1275.96 - 1279.44] anything you helped us for free and they
[1278.28 - 1281.08] were like we're just going to give you
[1279.44 - 1282.52] some little donations here at the start
[1281.08 - 1283.52] just so you can get some car insurance
[1282.52 - 1284.88] just so you could drive I said well
[1283.52 - 1286.88] driving doesn't really work for me that
[1284.88 - 1288.92] great anyway because I hear Spirit as
[1286.88 - 1290.56] I'm going down the street and spirit's
[1288.92 - 1291.92] telling me as I'm at a stoplight what's
[1290.56 - 1293.96] wrong with everybody in the left side of
[1291.92 - 1296.20] me and the right side of me or in front
[1293.96 - 1298.24] of me so you know but either way you
[1296.20 - 1299.56] know so it was one of these things where
[1298.24 - 1301.72] they said well you're going to have to
[1299.56 - 1304.28] you're going to have to get something
[1301.72 - 1306.40] something donations or something for
[1304.28 - 1308.44] what you're doing and so you know it
[1306.40 - 1309.88] kind of moved forward in my life from
[1308.44 - 1313.12] there that's just just filling in that
[1309.88 - 1317.52] blank if you're curious but the point is
[1313.12 - 1320.20] is Cole survived he survived Spirit told
[1317.52 - 1325.72] me when he walked in he wasn't going to
[1320.20 - 1330.72] make it if if if they left that day
[1325.72 - 1334.64] unsatisfied or confused or uncertain or
[1330.72 - 1336.84] not wanting to comply or whatever okay
[1334.64 - 1339.08] spirit said he's not going to make it I
[1336.84 - 1341.64] had that hanging over my head and this
[1339.08 - 1343.76] is 25 years ago had it hanging over my
[1341.64 - 1347.28] head like a lot of things that hung over
[1343.76 - 1348.64] my head with knowing too much but the
[1347.28 - 1352.36] point is
[1348.64 - 1355.68] is that chocolate saved his life saved
[1352.36 - 1357.16] his life so as much as you see I don't
[1355.68 - 1358.88] really talk about chocolate too much I
[1357.16 - 1360.00] have one recipe in life-changing Foods
[1358.88 - 1361.48] where there's a little bit chocolate
[1360.00 - 1362.80] involved I think it's a pomegranate
[1361.48 - 1364.60] recipe I don't know if you guys know it
[1362.80 - 1366.52] and stuff like that and fine I think you
[1364.60 - 1369.36] know I support it it's okay I have it in
[1366.52 - 1371.04] the book but I'm saying if you know if
[1369.36 - 1372.92] you really feel sick and you got a lot
[1371.04 - 1374.04] of problems keep it minimum don't do a
[1372.92 - 1375.56] lot of it you could do like the
[1374.04 - 1377.28] pomegranate recipe or something or do
[1375.56 - 1378.88] something once in a while don't tank it
[1377.28 - 1383.52] every day or don't have it you know like
[1378.88 - 1385.72] five times a week but addiction wise for
[1383.52 - 1388.36] espcially coming off the heavy stuff
[1385.72 - 1391.32] they heavy drugs the stuff that seems
[1388.36 - 1393.08] inconceivable to break for so many
[1391.32 - 1395.84] reasons more than one two three four
[1393.08 - 1398.84] five reasons so many the chocolate can
[1395.84 - 1400.68] be a savior in certain situation you see
[1398.84 - 1401.96] that's my love hate with it but I'm just
[1400.68 - 1403.28] letting you know that's why you know
[1401.96 - 1406.16] certain things that's why people say to
[1403.28 - 1407.60] me hey don't you love don't you love uh
[1406.16 - 1408.84] don't you love this diet don't you love
[1407.60 - 1410.24] this diet don't you love this diet it's
[1408.84 - 1413.16] like yeah but if you got something wrong
[1410.24 - 1416.60] with you not going to be good if you you
[1413.16 - 1419.00] know if you got a kidney disease you
[1416.60 - 1422.12] should not be eating steak or you will
[1419.00 - 1423.92] die early bottom line bottom line I was
[1422.12 - 1426.12] taught that by Spirit if you got a
[1423.92 - 1428.28] kidney disease you got a kidney issue
[1426.12 - 1430.04] you should not eat chicken or steak or
[1428.28 - 1431.52] any Animal product you have to be 100%
[1430.04 - 1434.76] plant-based if you have a kidney problem
[1431.52 - 1437.92] on any level you have to be 100%
[1434.76 - 1440.36] plant-based or you will may you may not
[1437.92 - 1442.64] not make it with a kidney disease bad
[1440.36 - 1444.72] kidney disease you have to back down the
[1442.64 - 1446.40] animal products with kidney diseases
[1444.72 - 1448.72] Spirit taught me that a long time ago so
[1446.40 - 1450.76] it's not about what diet to choose it's
[1448.72 - 1452.16] what's right when you're dealing with
[1450.76 - 1453.72] stuff if you're suffering from viral
[1452.16 - 1455.08] issues like Epstein bar anything like
[1453.72 - 1456.56] that you don't want to feed the virus
[1455.08 - 1458.92] why do you think I always say don't have
[1456.56 - 1460.40] eggs don't have dairy don't have eggs
[1458.92 - 1463.68] don't have dairy because you'll feed a
[1460.40 - 1465.60] virus and stay sick because it's not
[1463.68 - 1467.16] because I hate eggs that much you guys
[1465.60 - 1469.84] know my history I wanted to run an egg
[1467.16 - 1471.80] Shack when I was a child you know flip
[1469.84 - 1473.24] flipping you know flipping omelets all
[1471.80 - 1475.60] right but you know my dream never came
[1473.24 - 1478.24] true I had to stick with this instead so
[1475.60 - 1480.64] the bottom line is is that you know it's
[1478.24 - 1482.44] about what's right for you at the time
[1480.64 - 1484.44] and whether I you know like chocolate or
[1482.44 - 1487.08] not at the time I knew when to take that
[1484.44 - 1489.68] bar off the shelf for Cole to save his
[1487.08 - 1493.48] life his spirit said that will be
[1489.68 - 1496.60] medicine for his situation um so a
[1493.48 - 1498.32] little bit about that just just know you
[1496.60 - 1500.36] guys hanging in there get your feet seat
[1498.32 - 1503.28] bels on I don't even think you even put
[1500.36 - 1508.04] your seat bels on yet we got a little
[1503.28 - 1509.36] ways to go um so addictions to Salt
[1508.04 - 1510.92] isn't that interesting do you know
[1509.36 - 1513.72] anybody that's like hey I'm addicted to
[1510.92 - 1516.44] Salt I got this salt thing where can't
[1513.72 - 1519.60] get enough salt can't get enough salt
[1516.44 - 1522.72] okay because the reason why is because
[1519.60 - 1524.36] neurotransmitters run on sodium this
[1522.72 - 1526.76] doesn't mean you got to go and start
[1524.36 - 1528.84] tanking down salt every day this doesn't
[1526.76 - 1531.52] mean I just gave you the salt Freedom
[1528.84 - 1533.36] key all right that's not what that means
[1531.52 - 1534.80] I don't mind a little Himalayan rock
[1533.36 - 1536.76] salt or Mountain salt or something like
[1534.80 - 1540.60] that that's on your food or high quality
[1536.76 - 1543.44] sea salt I get it you know Salt's okay
[1540.60 - 1545.84] and and it is okay the neurotransmitters
[1543.44 - 1548.24] which are talked about in part one which
[1545.84 - 1550.72] get get interference from heavy metals
[1548.24 - 1553.24] which cause like bulimia which cause
[1550.72 - 1555.36] like anorexia you know things like that
[1553.24 - 1558.36] those the heavy metals that get in the
[1555.36 - 1560.28] way of like like the whole B addiction
[1558.36 - 1561.76] that whole you know feeling like that I
[1560.28 - 1563.32] talked about feeling that you have to
[1561.76 - 1567.32] relieve yourself of every content in
[1563.32 - 1569.20] your stomach the minute you eat because
[1567.32 - 1571.36] what's happening there is that what
[1569.20 - 1573.48] starts that what starts something like
[1571.36 - 1575.64] that is the toxic heavy metals in the
[1573.48 - 1577.56] brain Mercury being the number one so
[1575.64 - 1579.44] when Mercury interferes with
[1577.56 - 1582.04] neurotransmitters in in a certain part
[1579.44 - 1585.76] of the brain it actually causes a
[1582.04 - 1588.80] bulimic condition and then even if those
[1585.76 - 1591.08] heavy metals are removed or something
[1588.80 - 1592.92] Alters where you outgrow it brain tissue
[1591.08 - 1594.76] develops you know say you're in your
[1592.92 - 1596.20] youth you're you're a teenager and
[1594.76 - 1598.20] you're having bulimia or something like
[1596.20 - 1600.52] that volic condition what happens is
[1598.20 - 1603.20] that even if your brain tissue outows
[1600.52 - 1605.32] heavy metal and you get by you bypass
[1603.20 - 1607.48] that you're going to be addicted to your
[1605.32 - 1610.28] own adrenaline the reason why the
[1607.48 - 1613.24] vomiting thing is so hard to break with
[1610.28 - 1614.64] the Bing conditions the reason why is
[1613.24 - 1616.44] back to what I was saying before the
[1614.64 - 1618.36] adrenaline itself the adrenaline surge
[1616.44 - 1620.88] you get before you vomit you can get
[1618.36 - 1623.88] addicted to it's euphoric I talked about
[1620.88 - 1627.16] in part one it's absolutely euphoric and
[1623.88 - 1630.16] because it's euphoric it's like a a drug
[1627.16 - 1632.72] all in its own in fact a powerful drug
[1630.16 - 1636.28] never underestimate the power of this
[1632.72 - 1639.12] drug The Surge of adrenaline that occurs
[1636.28 - 1640.72] and so our addiction to Adrenaline can
[1639.12 - 1642.04] happen with so many different illnesses
[1640.72 - 1643.68] and I know some of you are thinking oh
[1642.04 - 1645.56] that's well that's sounds crazy you know
[1643.68 - 1646.96] I know someone who's who's who's bulimic
[1645.56 - 1649.60] and it's because they were abused or
[1646.96 - 1652.64] were yeah no of course but but it's but
[1649.60 - 1654.40] that's a trigger the abuse is a trigger
[1652.64 - 1657.00] you know a mental thing going on work
[1654.40 - 1658.80] you're under mental abuse and whatever
[1657.00 - 1661.36] it could be your sexually Abus abused
[1658.80 - 1664.44] anything going on yeah that's that's a
[1661.36 - 1666.40] severe trigger which then causes that
[1664.44 - 1668.60] that neurological problem which you you
[1666.40 - 1672.00] you you vomit but the adrenaline itself
[1668.60 - 1674.04] afterwards becomes the weapon it becomes
[1672.00 - 1676.56] the addiction and that's why people
[1674.04 - 1679.28] struggle with that it's it's the same
[1676.56 - 1681.28] thing with uh varieties of anorexia what
[1679.28 - 1684.04] happens is there's an adrenaline surgent
[1681.28 - 1686.16] occurs when you look at food especially
[1684.04 - 1687.92] if you have if you've been abused about
[1686.16 - 1690.04] food or something has happened about
[1687.92 - 1691.52] food and you know you're sitting at a
[1690.04 - 1693.64] table and food gets put in front of you
[1691.52 - 1695.76] your adrenaline starts surging and that
[1693.64 - 1698.16] adrenaline becomes your food becomes the
[1695.76 - 1700.20] drug so you don't need to eat so you
[1698.16 - 1701.92] literally lose your appetite immediately
[1700.20 - 1704.28] because adrenaline is surging through
[1701.92 - 1705.76] your system at a high rate and no one
[1704.28 - 1707.20] talks about this this is information
[1705.76 - 1708.80] that's never been out there anywhere it
[1707.20 - 1710.96] doesn't exist it's like most of the
[1708.80 - 1712.48] information that that we talk about on
[1710.96 - 1713.72] the show so if your first time on the
[1712.48 - 1715.36] show realize you're going to hear stuff
[1713.72 - 1718.48] you're never going to hear anybody else
[1715.36 - 1720.28] anywhere else um and uh and there's a
[1718.48 - 1721.64] reason for that lots of reasons if you
[1720.28 - 1726.56] don't know anything about me look into
[1721.64 - 1728.36] me um and uh so so okay so I wanted to
[1726.56 - 1732.32] cover that a little bit deeper such a
[1728.36 - 1733.60] serious situation and and so the key is
[1732.32 - 1735.72] is when
[1733.60 - 1737.24] someone's um getting older and they
[1735.72 - 1740.48] realize they got the the condition where
[1737.24 - 1742.96] the Bic or anorexic anorexic condition
[1740.48 - 1744.28] of any kind what happens is and I say
[1742.96 - 1746.00] any kind because there's different
[1744.28 - 1748.04] varieties there's no there's no one
[1746.00 - 1751.88] variety of these so many different
[1748.04 - 1753.68] varieties for for many reasons knowing
[1751.88 - 1756.28] knowing that there's an adrenaline
[1753.68 - 1757.88] addiction can save someone's life can
[1756.28 - 1760.56] save someone's life remember how I said
[1757.88 - 1763.16] at the beginning here you may not have
[1760.56 - 1765.12] the this the voice that I hear perfectly
[1763.16 - 1768.28] clear on the outside of the ear in real
[1765.12 - 1770.64] time you may not have that option okay
[1768.28 - 1772.52] because it just doesn't exist you may
[1770.64 - 1774.80] not have the option so how about getting
[1772.52 - 1776.40] the information from that voice that can
[1774.80 - 1778.24] save your life or save someone's life or
[1776.40 - 1781.88] somebody you know it it matters that's
[1778.24 - 1784.84] what I was saying earlier so so the deal
[1781.88 - 1787.88] is is that back to mineral salts with
[1784.84 - 1791.84] this mineral salts play a role in in
[1787.88 - 1793.60] Breaking adrenaline addictions so so
[1791.84 - 1795.24] what happens is we get people that are
[1793.60 - 1796.88] addicted to Salt because they're using
[1795.24 - 1797.84] the adrenals too much and doesn't mean
[1796.88 - 1798.88] they have
[1797.84 - 1802.20] something like
[1798.88 - 1803.48] anorexia or they have lmia or they have
[1802.20 - 1806.24] um you know they're addicted to
[1803.48 - 1808.48] something else whatever it it just means
[1806.24 - 1811.68] that if they have that salt thing going
[1808.48 - 1814.44] on they could get more addict addictive
[1811.68 - 1816.44] in different ways for different reasons
[1814.44 - 1817.68] the assault addiction is a sign that
[1816.44 - 1820.00] your body's craving your
[1817.68 - 1821.52] neurotransmitters are craving lots and
[1820.00 - 1824.52] lots of mineral
[1821.52 - 1826.40] salts and mineral salts do protect the
[1824.52 - 1829.16] adrenals in ways that are unbelievable
[1826.40 - 1830.60] so it's it's it's about the big time a
[1829.16 - 1832.96] big part of the adrenals why do you
[1830.60 - 1836.32] think I offer the adrenal snacks the
[1832.96 - 1837.60] adrenal snacks a celery stick right and
[1836.32 - 1839.68] so that's why we offer those adrenal
[1837.60 - 1841.52] snacks like celery stick one date so
[1839.68 - 1844.36] it's potassium in the date it's
[1841.52 - 1846.88] micromineral sodiums in the celery
[1844.36 - 1849.16] combined to the
[1846.88 - 1851.80] neurotransmitter okay but not only to
[1849.16 - 1855.08] the neurotransmitter to the
[1851.80 - 1857.56] adrenal and um and they protect us
[1855.08 - 1859.64] protecting our adrenals is a big part of
[1857.56 - 1861.48] breaking addictions cuz when you don't
[1859.64 - 1865.36] protect the adrenals the addictions can
[1861.48 - 1868.24] come on like a like a lion like a tiger
[1865.36 - 1869.64] like like a monster tigers and lions are
[1868.24 - 1872.88] monsters you know what I mean like a
[1869.64 - 1875.44] Monster can just come on like that and
[1872.88 - 1879.00] so we have to protect we have to so back
[1875.44 - 1883.36] to eating every hour hour and a half
[1879.00 - 1886.88] small meals if we can eating small meals
[1883.36 - 1889.72] small meals and they matter um these
[1886.88 - 1894.64] little snacks all through the day celery
[1889.72 - 1898.48] stick uh date okay um some berries uh
[1894.64 - 1900.80] cucumber sizes um you know anything like
[1898.48 - 1903.44] that I could you could look up all my my
[1900.80 - 1905.36] my snacks that that I offer in so many
[1903.44 - 1909.64] different ways including the blog and
[1905.36 - 1912.88] everything um so mineral salts are
[1909.64 - 1915.80] needed someone has the salt addiction
[1912.88 - 1918.64] they're desperately needing mineral
[1915.80 - 1921.08] salts to the brain into the
[1918.64 - 1923.80] adrenals all right where can you get
[1921.08 - 1926.32] those mineral salts too spinach leafy
[1923.80 - 1927.92] greens spinach especially spinach celery
[1926.32 - 1931.36] especially celery which is an herb but
[1927.92 - 1934.84] spinach leafy green the sodium content
[1931.36 - 1937.44] in spinach is the kind that really works
[1934.84 - 1940.52] versus getting the hit from that that
[1937.44 - 1943.36] Himalayan salt or or that fake salt in
[1940.52 - 1947.92] junk food you know or road salt in junk
[1943.36 - 1950.72] junk food those don't really cut
[1947.92 - 1951.92] meaning they don't get to the neuron
[1950.72 - 1953.84] they don't get to that neuron where the
[1951.92 - 1958.00] electrical pulse impulse runs through it
[1953.84 - 1961.16] like I explained part one and so so it's
[1958.00 - 1963.64] always important to understand that um
[1961.16 - 1966.04] you need real mineral salts from the
[1963.64 - 1968.92] celery by the way the mineral salts and
[1966.04 - 1971.80] celery are undiscovered before you all
[1968.92 - 1974.20] of a sudden say oh we know sodium is in
[1971.80 - 1976.84] in celery it's salty it's it's science
[1974.20 - 1979.44] already has it no science doesn't sorry
[1976.84 - 1981.48] they don't okay they know there's sodium
[1979.44 - 1983.64] in celery they don't know it's comprised
[1981.48 - 1985.24] of micromineral salt different sodiums
[1983.64 - 1987.08] different variety of sodiums that aren't
[1985.24 - 1988.68] even labeled listed in science and
[1987.08 - 1991.20] research under the lab because nobody
[1988.68 - 1993.00] cares no one wants to learn meaning and
[1991.20 - 1994.44] no one it's there's not like tons of
[1993.00 - 1996.60] funding going in to figure out what's
[1994.44 - 1998.00] inside celery I promise you that there
[1996.60 - 2000.16] isn't hundreds of millions of dollars
[1998.00 - 2002.12] going into celery all right to figure
[2000.16 - 2003.76] out what's in it all right but it's got
[2002.12 - 2006.00] these micromineral salts comprise
[2003.76 - 2008.44] subgroups com I even talk about it in
[2006.00 - 2010.04] life-changing Foods a little bit um so
[2008.44 - 2012.08] pick up life-changing foods you can even
[2010.04 - 2015.40] get more obviously more
[2012.08 - 2018.24] information um so all right let's go
[2015.40 - 2020.80] let's keep on going through this so
[2018.24 - 2022.96] sodium addiction because your
[2020.80 - 2024.92] neurotransmitters need the salt your
[2022.96 - 2028.72] adrenals need the salt well the
[2024.92 - 2031.32] micromineral salts okay and then sugar
[2028.72 - 2034.52] addiction because your brain needs the
[2031.32 - 2036.68] glucose and your liver needs the glucose
[2034.52 - 2038.80] all right and so we're going to cross
[2036.68 - 2040.40] that threshold a little bit more today
[2038.80 - 2042.76] on the sugar
[2040.40 - 2046.32] addiction how do you stay addicted to
[2042.76 - 2049.16] Sugar you meaning addicted to bad sugar
[2046.32 - 2053.20] how do you stay addicted to bad sugar by
[2049.16 - 2054.96] having bad fat mixed with it ice cream
[2053.20 - 2056.64] that right there will will make sure
[2054.96 - 2059.32] that no glucose gets to your brain and
[2056.64 - 2061.24] liver you'll starve your brain and liver
[2059.32 - 2064.32] and because of the fats in the ice cream
[2061.24 - 2067.12] will stop that sugar that glucose from
[2064.32 - 2070.24] getting into the brain and the liver see
[2067.12 - 2071.12] what happens is the wrong fats and too
[2070.24 - 2074.64] much
[2071.12 - 2077.24] fat stops sugar from going to where it
[2074.64 - 2079.64] needs to go into cells into muscles into
[2077.24 - 2081.84] the heart into the brain into the liver
[2079.64 - 2083.96] no one talks about that out there it's
[2081.84 - 2086.00] like it's like disheartening it's all
[2083.96 - 2088.68] about high fat high fat high fat high
[2086.00 - 2090.68] fat no sugar high fat no sugar that's
[2088.68 - 2094.52] ridiculous in a million ways I can't
[2090.68 - 2096.52] even tell you guys I'm not talking about
[2094.52 - 2098.48] um you know Silly lowfat diets I'm
[2096.52 - 2100.08] talking about the right kind of fats the
[2098.48 - 2102.32] right amounts depending on what's going
[2100.08 - 2104.88] on with you depending on what's
[2102.32 - 2107.76] Happening and if you got a sugar
[2104.88 - 2109.80] addiction if you need you know if if you
[2107.76 - 2112.28] feel like you you're on sweets all the
[2109.80 - 2115.36] time you're missing glycogen and glucose
[2112.28 - 2118.92] to the brain you're missing which which
[2115.36 - 2121.04] all this leads to addictions sugar
[2118.92 - 2123.08] addictions because you want more and
[2121.04 - 2125.12] more of the bad sugar cuz the sugar
[2123.08 - 2127.52] won't go in the right place so you going
[2125.12 - 2130.52] more and more Donuts more and more
[2127.52 - 2132.88] uh cookies more and more danishes more
[2130.52 - 2136.20] and more Bagels more and more I don't
[2132.88 - 2138.40] know whatever just whatever what kind of
[2136.20 - 2140.60] what kind of candy do you guys like kind
[2138.40 - 2142.68] of sugar do you guys like it's got to be
[2140.60 - 2144.16] switched over to dates it's got to be
[2142.68 - 2147.12] switched over to fruits it's got to be
[2144.16 - 2150.12] switched over to raw honey sugars that
[2147.12 - 2152.92] are the healthy sugars okay the healthy
[2150.12 - 2155.72] sugars for sure maybe some Fuji apples
[2152.92 - 2157.96] maybe some braver and apples uh maybe
[2155.72 - 2159.52] some galala apples um you know maybe
[2157.96 - 2161.72] some arom apples if you can find them
[2159.52 - 2164.96] somewhere in an orchard somewhere else
[2161.72 - 2167.96] at the end of the year but but the point
[2164.96 - 2170.08] is is that the right kind of sugar can
[2167.96 - 2172.28] get to the brain and stop sugar
[2170.08 - 2173.92] addictions but it needs to make sure
[2172.28 - 2177.16] that you're not eating the wrong kind of
[2173.92 - 2180.76] fats too high in fat that you're not
[2177.16 - 2183.52] like filled with with with nothing but
[2180.76 - 2185.96] too many uh of the wrong omegas the
[2183.52 - 2187.68] Omega-3s are really important and
[2185.96 - 2189.76] getting them in the right sources are
[2187.68 - 2191.76] critical when it comes down to making
[2189.76 - 2193.72] sure sugar absorbs the correct way so
[2191.76 - 2196.20] let's go over some of the right fats
[2193.72 - 2198.04] hemp seeds that's the right kind of fat
[2196.20 - 2200.88] but you don't want a whole full bag of
[2198.04 - 2203.00] hemp seeds a day cuz then it's going to
[2200.88 - 2204.32] be so much fat or you don't want a big
[2203.00 - 2206.32] container of hemp butter it's going to
[2204.32 - 2208.36] be so much fat it's going to stop the
[2206.32 - 2210.36] right kind of sugar from getting to the
[2208.36 - 2212.52] brain and restoring the brain so you
[2210.36 - 2213.92] don't fall into any kind of addiction I
[2212.52 - 2217.20] don't care what the addiction is you
[2213.92 - 2218.60] could fall into it you see and making
[2217.20 - 2220.24] sure the right kind of sugar gets into
[2218.60 - 2222.56] the liver that then what I mean by Sugar
[2220.24 - 2224.48] I mean glucose sto restoring glycogen
[2222.56 - 2228.60] deposits restoring carbohydrate deposits
[2224.48 - 2230.84] in the brain and in in the liver now I'm
[2228.60 - 2233.96] touching upon a lot of this in this
[2230.84 - 2235.76] little area because I know on part one
[2233.96 - 2238.88] when I said the brain is made out of
[2235.76 - 2239.96] carbohydrates I meant it it is but
[2238.88 - 2242.32] there's going to be a lot there's going
[2239.96 - 2244.20] to be an anger Fest because of that
[2242.32 - 2247.16] because right now there's misinformation
[2244.20 - 2250.88] the brain is all fat the whole thing on
[2247.16 - 2252.80] the brain being filled with fat is is
[2250.88 - 2256.16] complete misinformation and a total
[2252.80 - 2260.16] misconception there are micro deposits
[2256.16 - 2263.52] of fats in the brain that are Omega-3s
[2260.16 - 2265.92] but here's the thing not just
[2263.52 - 2269.32] Omega-3s okay
[2265.92 - 2271.76] oils that aren't even on record one of
[2269.32 - 2274.24] the oils on record in the brain is
[2271.76 - 2276.20] swalling okay that's one of the oils on
[2274.24 - 2279.16] record in science and research that's in
[2276.20 - 2284.00] the brain is squalling all right that's
[2279.16 - 2286.28] a micro that's a micro fat micro fat the
[2284.00 - 2289.72] brain isn't made of fat or filled with
[2286.28 - 2294.80] fat it's got these really tiny
[2289.72 - 2297.24] little micro omegas hidden in certain
[2294.80 - 2299.48] areas of the brain undiscovered by
[2297.24 - 2302.52] science and research squalene is one of
[2299.48 - 2304.92] them but that is discovered that is
[2302.52 - 2308.28] discovered by science and research thank
[2304.92 - 2311.48] God okay because it gives us hope but
[2308.28 - 2313.52] there's all kinds of subgroups of these
[2311.48 - 2315.44] Omega-3s guess where you get them
[2313.52 - 2316.92] watermelon seeds when you eat your
[2315.44 - 2319.08] watermelon you bite your seed and you
[2316.92 - 2322.60] chew it up that's where you get it you
[2319.08 - 2326.16] ready hem seeds all right and you ready
[2322.60 - 2328.76] butterleaf lettuce butterleaf
[2326.16 - 2332.96] lettuce in butterleaf lettuce there's
[2328.76 - 2336.80] these micro fats and the there's these
[2332.96 - 2339.96] Omega-3s that that do go to the brain
[2336.80 - 2342.96] it's not a hunk of fat or it's not fats
[2339.96 - 2346.60] it's different it's like a micro Omega
[2342.96 - 2348.64] that's got a viscosity that's so thin
[2346.60 - 2351.12] that it won't even constitute as a fat
[2348.64 - 2354.40] or seem it or or be like it and it's not
[2351.12 - 2358.00] a lot of it not a lot of it even really
[2354.40 - 2361.84] small amounts that get into the brain
[2358.00 - 2364.84] all right and blackberry seeds the seeds
[2361.84 - 2366.48] of a Blackberry tomato seeds when you
[2364.84 - 2369.32] eat your tomato there's seeds in the
[2366.48 - 2371.48] tomato that seed has an omega-3
[2369.32 - 2372.84] undocumented by research in science by
[2371.48 - 2374.76] food research and Science and any kind
[2372.84 - 2376.72] of research in science and that's the
[2374.76 - 2378.36] kind that goes to the brain in said
[2376.72 - 2380.32] people are loading up on all this bad
[2378.36 - 2382.12] fat all kinds of crappy fat everywhere
[2380.32 - 2383.28] and I'm just talking about fried grease
[2382.12 - 2384.64] and all that I'm talking about what
[2383.28 - 2386.40] people think is healthy fat they got it
[2384.64 - 2388.48] stacked to the brim they're being told
[2386.40 - 2390.88] it's healthy and they're losing the
[2388.48 - 2392.28] glucose reserves in their brain and it
[2390.88 - 2394.84] could set you up for some serious
[2392.28 - 2396.08] Alzheimer's but not just that addictions
[2394.84 - 2397.48] if you're trying to break any kind of
[2396.08 - 2399.44] addiction
[2397.48 - 2402.40] you don't want your diet so high in fat
[2399.44 - 2404.28] so I'm giving you detailed information
[2402.40 - 2406.60] so that you're not leaving here confused
[2404.28 - 2409.80] thinking ah the guy he's got a different
[2406.60 - 2411.76] belief on whatever no fat whole world
[2409.80 - 2414.04] says fat every doctor says it now
[2411.76 - 2417.16] whatever no no this is this is about
[2414.04 - 2419.96] knowing what's what's right yeah and I
[2417.16 - 2422.08] have the right to say that because of my
[2419.96 - 2423.36] source other than that I wouldn't have
[2422.08 - 2424.96] the right to say that I'd be just
[2423.36 - 2426.64] swimming on the internet looking for
[2424.96 - 2428.76] misinformation being like well I don't
[2426.64 - 2431.28] know I guess I'll follow this but I'm
[2428.76 - 2433.04] lucky I'm blessed and that blessing that
[2431.28 - 2434.40] I have I want to share with you bottom
[2433.04 - 2437.28] line so you understand so what that
[2434.40 - 2439.52] means is that so whether you're you know
[2437.28 - 2441.24] eating a meat eating diet or just a
[2439.52 - 2443.28] straight vegetarian diet or vegan diet
[2441.24 - 2446.00] whatever it is keep the fats low for
[2443.28 - 2448.96] bringing more butter lettuce mashe MH I
[2446.00 - 2451.16] talked about it in the last episode um
[2448.96 - 2452.56] get some watermelon seeds you know
[2451.16 - 2454.12] they're out there you can buy them and
[2452.56 - 2456.60] eat them you know have them in the
[2454.12 - 2458.32] watermelon some hemp seeds sesame seeds
[2456.60 - 2460.76] have a little bit of it you some sesame
[2458.32 - 2462.92] seeds some tahini make sure these are
[2460.76 - 2464.60] mixed in whatever diet You' got so if
[2462.92 - 2466.20] you're eating turkey make sure you also
[2464.60 - 2467.72] have some of these things mixed in if
[2466.20 - 2469.56] you're not eating any kind of animal
[2467.72 - 2471.48] product make sure you got you know these
[2469.56 - 2474.48] in there which you probably most likely
[2471.48 - 2476.72] do because you got more room for it but
[2474.48 - 2479.84] so that's and and what does this play
[2476.72 - 2483.40] like a role in where and how I'll tell
[2479.84 - 2485.00] you it plays a role by halting
[2483.40 - 2487.36] addictions when you get enough glucose
[2485.00 - 2489.12] to the brain and and the liver your
[2487.36 - 2490.32] liver is not going to be starving for it
[2489.12 - 2492.16] your brain's not going to be starving
[2490.32 - 2494.96] for it and you're not going to go into
[2492.16 - 2496.08] deep into addictions of all kinds and
[2494.96 - 2498.64] you're also going to have protection
[2496.08 - 2502.52] against adrenaline surges that can get
[2498.64 - 2504.16] you addicted to anything addicted to
[2502.52 - 2507.88] literally
[2504.16 - 2509.92] anything okay very important to know
[2507.88 - 2513.00] very important to know and you don't
[2509.92 - 2516.32] want to be addicted to Danger okay I I I
[2513.00 - 2518.68] I recently told a story about when I was
[2516.32 - 2520.28] in my childhood on my street and
[2518.68 - 2521.60] everybody looked at me because they knew
[2520.28 - 2524.92] I would do things a little bit more
[2521.60 - 2527.20] daring because I heard a voice and the
[2524.92 - 2529.80] voice The Voice made me kind of what
[2527.20 - 2531.84] would be um you know not unstop
[2529.80 - 2534.60] stoppable but indestructible or whatever
[2531.84 - 2536.60] it is and you know I was considered
[2534.60 - 2538.68] superhero in my childhood because of
[2536.60 - 2541.56] what the voice would say like like
[2538.68 - 2545.24] diagnosing uh a friend's mom of diabetes
[2541.56 - 2547.56] or whatever it was and and what what
[2545.24 - 2549.96] happened is because that I also felt
[2547.56 - 2552.60] like I can do anything so I would do
[2549.96 - 2554.76] things that were dared devilish dared
[2552.60 - 2557.84] devilish but I found during those
[2554.76 - 2560.16] Daredevil causes um going against Spirit
[2557.84 - 2563.52] of course I found that the adrenaline
[2560.16 - 2565.40] ride in it D like Daredevil anything
[2563.52 - 2567.08] jumping on a bungee cord I mean with a
[2565.40 - 2570.32] bungee cord attached to you which I've
[2567.08 - 2573.00] never done but anything like that you
[2570.32 - 2575.16] can get addicted to Adrenaline and then
[2573.00 - 2576.44] okay fine what does that mean that means
[2575.16 - 2578.48] you might all of a sudden SE drinking
[2576.44 - 2580.64] too much coffee and never be able to
[2578.48 - 2583.48] break it you might be you might be you
[2580.64 - 2585.68] know um you know doing some kind of uh
[2583.48 - 2587.76] amphetamine that's prescription you
[2585.68 - 2589.56] can't break it you might be able to you
[2587.76 - 2591.68] might not be able to break a sugar bad
[2589.56 - 2594.56] sugar diet you might not not even to
[2591.68 - 2595.72] break a whatever and so whatever that is
[2594.56 - 2598.24] cigarettes and so forth I want to tell
[2595.72 - 2599.96] you a little cigarette pack trick
[2598.24 - 2601.80] cigarette I call it the cigarette pack
[2599.96 - 2604.88] trick I think I might even talked about
[2601.80 - 2606.84] in one of the episodes possibly going uh
[2604.88 - 2610.80] going all the way back last here maybe
[2606.84 - 2612.16] maybe longer um one way to to to can
[2610.80 - 2614.48] give you some information on how to
[2612.16 - 2617.32] break cigarettes first of all the reason
[2614.48 - 2619.88] why you're smoking cigarettes is because
[2617.32 - 2621.00] cigarettes activate adrenaline they shut
[2619.88 - 2623.76] off your
[2621.00 - 2625.20] appetite um they they you know you ever
[2623.76 - 2626.48] hear about hey when people get off of
[2625.20 - 2628.48] cigarettes they get off the nicotine
[2626.48 - 2631.28] they start eating more have you been
[2628.48 - 2632.96] through that in your life that's because
[2631.28 - 2634.64] um the adrenaline surges are calming
[2632.96 - 2636.92] down you're not you're not getting that
[2634.64 - 2640.16] adrenaline amped up
[2636.92 - 2641.76] so one way and here another reason why
[2640.16 - 2644.92] people get addicted to smoking isn't
[2641.76 - 2645.92] just because of nicotine being a drug um
[2644.92 - 2649.16] it's
[2645.92 - 2652.36] because cigarettes make you alkaline for
[2649.16 - 2654.96] a quick second a hot second they make
[2652.36 - 2657.64] you alkaline so for like 30 seconds you
[2654.96 - 2660.36] get an alkaline hit you get alkaline
[2657.64 - 2662.64] like it's this this this super sonic
[2660.36 - 2665.60] wave of bam you're
[2662.64 - 2666.96] alkaline and that happens when you smoke
[2665.60 - 2669.52] cigarettes
[2666.96 - 2671.52] and then it goes o way acidic so you
[2669.52 - 2673.24] need another you need another cigarette
[2671.52 - 2674.92] and boom to get the alkaline hit then
[2673.24 - 2678.20] you go way acidic then boom you get the
[2674.92 - 2681.80] alkaline hit then you go away acidic and
[2678.20 - 2684.32] um because the coal that's
[2681.80 - 2689.20] burning when when it's in
[2684.32 - 2692.20] between of being fresh tobacco and then
[2689.20 - 2694.04] burnt tobacco a chemical compound
[2692.20 - 2695.56] develops in between that nobody knows
[2694.04 - 2699.36] about once again undiscovered by
[2695.56 - 2702.36] research science that becomes so
[2699.36 - 2705.44] alkaline so alkaline it's off the chart
[2702.36 - 2708.96] it's this one split
[2705.44 - 2711.72] 0.00000000 Point whatever 1% of time
[2708.96 - 2715.04] that this chemical ignites but it
[2711.72 - 2717.84] ignites between the fresh tobacco and
[2715.04 - 2719.64] the burning tobacco and right when it
[2717.84 - 2721.96] poofs right when it ignites right there
[2719.64 - 2724.40] you end up getting it into the system
[2721.96 - 2726.32] and it is more powerful than 10 million
[2724.40 - 2728.08] tons of nicotine that's being you know
[2726.32 - 2730.52] that's being exagger exag I'm
[2728.08 - 2734.56] exaggerating on that of course whatever
[2730.52 - 2736.32] um but it's so amped up and it gives you
[2734.56 - 2739.68] an alkaline hit to the
[2736.32 - 2741.60] brain not into the lung to the brain
[2739.68 - 2743.92] right away and that's out what you're
[2741.60 - 2746.52] hooked on nobody knows nobody know they
[2743.92 - 2750.16] think it's nicotine nicotine is just an
[2746.52 - 2753.68] aspect of it it's this alkaline hit
[2750.16 - 2755.60] that's what it is and so so when you
[2753.68 - 2756.76] know when that's occurring it's hard to
[2755.60 - 2760.00] break break it also you got the
[2756.76 - 2762.48] adrenaline rush cuz every time you go
[2760.00 - 2766.68] into your pack of cigarettes and you're
[2762.48 - 2769.60] about to pull out a smoke a Sig your
[2766.68 - 2771.52] adrenaline starts running and if it's
[2769.60 - 2773.96] held back from you a little longer your
[2771.52 - 2775.92] adrenaline runs more and if you can't
[2773.96 - 2777.20] get to your break time at work go
[2775.92 - 2778.84] outside and you know wherever you're
[2777.20 - 2781.20] working whether it's you know a store or
[2778.84 - 2782.56] factory or whatever you do in your life
[2781.20 - 2784.20] whatever and you want to get a break or
[2782.56 - 2785.32] you work in a hotel and you want to step
[2784.20 - 2787.48] out in the back of the hotel or a
[2785.32 - 2789.00] restaurant you want to get a cigarette
[2787.48 - 2791.64] and you miss that break and you got to
[2789.00 - 2793.68] wait for the next break your adrenaline
[2791.64 - 2795.76] starts running more and more and more
[2793.68 - 2798.28] and you won't even want food your
[2795.76 - 2799.48] adrenaline's pumping through your veins
[2798.28 - 2801.20] remember I told you about the two big
[2799.48 - 2802.96] groups in part one if you haven't heard
[2801.20 - 2806.44] part one you got to hear part one you
[2802.96 - 2807.76] got to find part one I'm I'm I'm asking
[2806.44 - 2812.24] you find part
[2807.76 - 2814.04] one after this after this one um so what
[2812.24 - 2816.24] happens is that two groups is that group
[2814.04 - 2819.28] is adrenaline the other one's glucose so
[2816.24 - 2821.04] you're sitting there and you're waiting
[2819.28 - 2822.56] and adrenaline's running more and more
[2821.04 - 2825.48] as soon as you get that cigarette out
[2822.56 - 2827.04] your adrenaline's fired up and running
[2825.48 - 2829.76] and then you get the hit and then boom
[2827.04 - 2831.40] you're alkaline for 30 seconds that's
[2829.76 - 2833.12] what happens of course you'll have also
[2831.40 - 2835.20] a nicotine with TR withdrawal off of
[2833.12 - 2837.28] nicotine that is real but it's only part
[2835.20 - 2839.56] of it you guys part of it so what's a
[2837.28 - 2842.96] good cigarette trick here's what you got
[2839.56 - 2845.40] to do here's where I like chocolate once
[2842.96 - 2849.12] again good old chocolate Spirit taught
[2845.40 - 2851.16] me this trick for people okay all right
[2849.12 - 2853.08] so you got two packs of cigarettes you
[2851.16 - 2855.68] empty one of them so you empty one of
[2853.08 - 2857.80] the packs so it's empty well you should
[2855.68 - 2859.48] empty the other pack too because you're
[2857.80 - 2861.68] only going to put 10 cigarettes in that
[2859.48 - 2864.12] pack not 20 so you're going to put 10
[2861.68 - 2865.48] cigarettes back in that pack the other
[2864.12 - 2866.72] pack that you emptied completely you're
[2865.48 - 2868.60] going to fill with little pieces of
[2866.72 - 2870.08] chocolate the little pieces little
[2868.60 - 2872.84] pieces from the little chocolate bar not
[2870.08 - 2874.00] the big one I talked about earlier
[2872.84 - 2875.88] you're going to fill that with little
[2874.00 - 2878.76] pieces of chocolate you're going to
[2875.88 - 2881.20] stock it okay and what you're going to
[2878.76 - 2882.92] do is you're going to have every time
[2881.20 - 2885.24] you get that adrenaline surge that
[2882.92 - 2887.24] adrenaline surge is coming on like babbe
[2885.24 - 2889.24] that adrenaline surge is is coming on
[2887.24 - 2890.80] and and you know it and it's break time
[2889.24 - 2893.56] and you're about to have your cigarette
[2890.80 - 2895.92] or whatever it is you pull out a piece
[2893.56 - 2897.24] of chocolate out of the the empty pack
[2895.92 - 2899.60] that that was filled with chocolate
[2897.24 - 2901.48] pieces it even soaks up some of that
[2899.60 - 2902.84] nicotine believe it or not cuz nicotine
[2901.48 - 2905.12] is is
[2902.84 - 2907.72] aromatic and and soaks up some of that
[2905.12 - 2909.84] tobacco everything else so that the
[2907.72 - 2911.28] chocolate pieces and if you do this
[2909.84 - 2913.44] ahead of time your chocolate pieces will
[2911.28 - 2916.24] soak up a good aroma of cigarettes by
[2913.44 - 2917.60] the way so you pop one or two little
[2916.24 - 2919.88] pieces in your
[2917.60 - 2921.40] mouth and you don't chew them up and
[2919.88 - 2923.20] swallow them right away you leave them
[2921.40 - 2924.84] in your mouth as long as they can until
[2923.20 - 2928.20] they melt until they take their time
[2924.84 - 2929.92] it's all the way to the bank you do that
[2928.20 - 2931.56] all right and then the next time you
[2929.92 - 2933.40] have a cigarette out of your 10 your 10
[2931.56 - 2935.72] cigarette pack and you break down you
[2933.40 - 2937.00] cut your cigarettes down in half you cut
[2935.72 - 2938.72] them down in half you could do five
[2937.00 - 2940.88] cigarettes you could be whatever daring
[2938.72 - 2942.72] level you think you are start at 15
[2940.88 - 2944.92] cigarettes whatever you might be doing
[2942.72 - 2948.48] and you keep both packs on you another
[2944.92 - 2951.76] secret weapon is never smoke
[2948.48 - 2954.88] inside smoke outside always smoke
[2951.76 - 2956.08] outside but that's not all only smoke
[2954.88 - 2958.64] when you're
[2956.08 - 2961.84] walking if you can try that one it's a
[2958.64 - 2964.16] Sure Shot way to quit only smoke while
[2961.84 - 2966.52] walking you'll take less drags and
[2964.16 - 2968.28] you'll get less you know addictive
[2966.52 - 2970.44] nicotine like we're talking about and
[2968.28 - 2972.08] other stuff going on it's all going to
[2970.44 - 2974.60] be calming down a bit because you're
[2972.08 - 2977.16] gonna be walking you're going to be
[2974.60 - 2980.56] walking off your smoking habit because
[2977.16 - 2983.64] it's hard to smoke while walking it's
[2980.56 - 2985.76] harder versus just standing there or
[2983.64 - 2988.48] being outside so that's another
[2985.76 - 2991.04] technique is you have to do the walking
[2988.48 - 2993.52] while smoking thing and what you can do
[2991.04 - 2996.36] is get more oxygen in you because you're
[2993.52 - 2998.28] walking and yeah so that's the other
[2996.36 - 3000.52] trick plus with the the you know the
[2998.28 - 3003.60] packs so these are the two you know two
[3000.52 - 3005.12] very powerful ways you do them combined

[3005.12 - 3008.00] quit smoking your adrenaline will
[3006.52 - 3009.28] eventually Cal down because when you're
[3008.00 - 3012.08] taking that
[3009.28 - 3014.52] walk and you're smoking less cigarette
[3012.08 - 3015.96] you're ad Dre adrenaline that's pumping
[3014.52 - 3017.44] you're not just standing there while
[3015.96 - 3020.40] adrenaline is pumping making you a
[3017.44 - 3023.00] victim making you prey whatever it is
[3020.40 - 3024.56] you know you you what what happens is
[3023.00 - 3026.68] your adrenaline is being used as you're

[3026.68 - 3031.64] to be less

[3031.64 - 3037.64] that's the cigarette technique cigarette
[3033.52 - 3039.28] pack trick so you know that make sure

[3052.24 - 3056.80] sweet brain stuff a little bit very
[3055.00 - 3059.04] important cover the eating every two
[3056.80 - 3061.52] hours to hour and a half that can help
[3059.04 - 3064.40] stop any addiction any percentage you
[3061.52 - 3067.76] get out of the show any trick or any
[3064.40 - 3069.04] piece of information that's powerful
[3067.76 - 3071.68] okay it's powerful I'm going to go
[3069.04 - 3074.52] through one thing spiritually for just a
[3071.68 - 3078.12] few seconds there's also spiritual
[3074.52 - 3080.20] energy that's at hand with addictions
[3078.12 - 3083.68] okay you know I hate going into this
[3080.20 - 3085.08] land too much but we have angels and
[3083.68 - 3087.32] those angels are there for us and we
[3085.08 - 3089.56] need to call upon them and I don't hate
[3087.32 - 3091.20] going into the angel thing I love it we
[3089.56 - 3093.16] know because you know there's angel I
[3091.20 - 3094.68] have two Angel chapters in you know in
[3093.16 - 3097.24] my books I have an angel chapter in book
[3094.68 - 3098.76] one book two uh life-changing angels I
[3097.24 - 3100.88] just you know we just you guys know
[3098.76 - 3103.04] about now which are really incredible to
[3100.88 - 3104.96] have on your side especially even with
[3103.04 - 3107.84] with eating problems or
[3104.96 - 3110.04] anything but there's also negative
[3107.84 - 3112.24] energies out there there's just negative
[3110.04 - 3115.56] energy out there I'll just simplify it
[3112.24 - 3119.20] those negative energies love addictions
[3115.56 - 3122.24] love people that are trapped in
[3119.20 - 3124.44] addictions be aware that there's just
[3122.24 - 3127.00] psychic energy out there that there's
[3124.44 - 3129.92] psychic energy out there that that that
[3127.00 - 3131.60] just that just magnetically likes to be
[3129.92 - 3134.92] involved with
[3131.60 - 3136.64] addictions okay there's something that
[3134.92 - 3138.48] um that you know how the alcohol is
[3136.64 - 3140.16] called spirits you probably heard that
[3138.48 - 3142.96] before but guess who started that one I
[3140.16 - 3144.88] started that one 30 years ago 30 years
[3142.96 - 3146.84] ago I started that one that one came
[3144.88 - 3148.40] from me if you ever I always say there's
[3146.84 - 3150.52] stuff that has gone around and come
[3148.40 - 3152.16] around and it came from me real early on
[3150.52 - 3155.16] I could even prove that one I have that
[3152.16 - 3157.80] one in writing 30 years ago and what
[3155.16 - 3160.60] happens is that that whole Spirit thing
[3157.80 - 3162.00] involved with Spirits with alcohol why
[3160.60 - 3163.76] we call them Spirits or why they've been
[3162.00 - 3167.00] called spirits is for that reason
[3163.76 - 3169.64] because Spirits do or an energy does
[3167.00 - 3173.04] come around when we're trashing
[3169.64 - 3175.28] ourselves in any way possible whatever
[3173.04 - 3178.20] that might be I mean even if it's on the
[3175.28 - 3179.80] most mildest level so just be aware that
[3178.20 - 3181.16] you want to cut out that negativity you
[3179.80 - 3182.48] want to cut out those negative energies
[3181.16 - 3185.08] you don't want to let them feed off of
[3182.48 - 3186.80] your addictions too as well whatever
[3185.08 - 3189.00] that might be so I just wanted to pop
[3186.80 - 3193.32] that at you one last second while we're
