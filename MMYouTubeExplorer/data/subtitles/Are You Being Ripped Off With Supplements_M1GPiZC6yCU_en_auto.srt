1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
in their body they're worried about what

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,359
they're eating they're worried about

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,340
different exposures they're worried

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,519
about the quality of what they're

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,460
ingesting or putting on their body it's

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,740
all about oh this has got coconut oil in

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,260
it this has got and everybody is always

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,560
concerned about like what bad things

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,240
could be in things meanwhile I see it

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,340
out there every single day they're

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,980
taking supplements

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,660
and they're taking supplements that are

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,520
filled with crap

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,860
and they're getting ripped off

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,800
bottom line that's what's happening out

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,079
there all day long it's going on out

17
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,340
there and people don't realize it

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,260
and there's a whole bunch of people out

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,320
there with sensitivities

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,879
but they don't realize they're taking

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,100
supplements with all kinds of different

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,500
additives in there and different

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,719
impurities in there and different toxins

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,300
in there and they don't realize that's

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,100
contributing to their sensitivities

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,420
so so many people out there don't know

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,760
what's in their supplements they're

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,700
blindly taking things that seem like

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,060
they're trendy or hot companies in the

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,979
moment or fast talkers or people who own

31
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,320
supplement companies that are talking a

32
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,600
good you know Vibe they're talking good

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,820
whatever our stuff is the best stuff and

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,979
the best quality meanwhile there's crap

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,600
and garbage all through it and this is

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,159
going to blow your mind when I discuss a

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,500

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,060
for your body

51
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,159
to actually just learn and to be

52
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,500
educated and understand what's going out

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,780

care about propolis to begin with

134
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,580
because you're looking at nervous system

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,139
think about that nervous system and

136
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,240

we're going to go deeper on to the

152
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,780
nervous system deeper on to the into the

153
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,419
immune system as well so let's get down

154
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,740
to the nitty-gritty let's get down to

155
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:06,300
the bad news the bad news

156
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,860
when you go into the store and you're

157
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,080
buying your lemon balm and you go in the

158
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,120
store and you're buying your propolis or

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,539
whatever it is you're buying

160
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,340
you have no idea what's in there and

161
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,440
what's going on and what's going wrong

162
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,840
basically

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,580
you're just being ripped off or fooled

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,680
or taken advantage of and that's what

165
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,199
it's like in the supplement world

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,940
that's how it works so let's cut into it

167
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,539
a little bit

168
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:38,160
I am going to take a look here okay for

169
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:39,720
a second now this is a propolis right

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
here

171
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,919
see I got the brand marked off this is a

172
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,919
propolis right here

173
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,560
now

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,900
this propolis does not say it has

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,360
alcohol in it

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,400
it does not say it has alcohol in it

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,080
keep that in mind so if you're somebody

178
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,340
that's into propolis this looks like a

179
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,039
great company it looked like a great

180
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,039
brand it's in the store it's out there

181
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:14,220
you purchase it you don't know

182
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:16,800
but it has alcohol in it when it says it

183
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,660
doesn't when there isn't alcohol on the

184
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,660
label now I opened this up

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,819
and it smells like

186
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,440
I'm at a bar

187
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,940
that's how much alcohol is in this

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,000
propolis

189
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,819
it smells like this is a shot of whiskey

190
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,560
that's what it smells like I opened it

191
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,500
up

192
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,599
and it smells like straight grain

193
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,180
alcohol

194
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:47,400
but you would never know that

195
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,699
there are propolises that say alcohol

196
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,800
free but still have alcohol in it

197
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,120
and that's something to know all on its

198
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,580
own

199
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,680
so there's propolises out there that say

200
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,139
alcohol free but still have alcohol in

201
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,680
it this is a propolis that no one would

202
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,780
ever know has alcohol in it

203
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,580
they would never know because they'd be

204
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,560
like wait this doesn't have all the

205
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,860
ingredient says

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,660
is glycerin and water

207
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,400
it's all it says

208
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,400
there's so much alcohol in here

209
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,539
you can get like

210
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,580
Tipsy just breathing that in and that's

211
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,910
how propolises are out there

212
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,039
that's an example

213
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,860
[Music]

214
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,560
here's a propolis right here from a very

215
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,479
well-known company a company that's in

216
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,039
every store a company that's out there

217
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,219
everywhere

218
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,839
okay this is in a tincture bottle if you

219
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,339
go into the health food store if you go

220
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:46,440
anywhere you go into Whole Foods there's

221
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:49,860
a whole section and this is a tincture

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,640
within that section not saying the brand

223
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,040
and this one says it has alcohol in it

224
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,080
it's a propolis that actually says it

225
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,260
has alcohol so at least you know it has

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,420
alcohol in it but here is the amazing

227
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,720
part of this one you'll see this

228
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,560
propolis ready so this says it has

229
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,560
alcohol in it

230
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,820
which you don't want so if you guys are

231
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,339
confused at what I'm saying

232
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,339
the vemergy propolis pure does not have

233
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,420
alcohol in it hidden in it doesn't have

234
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,800
it hidden

235
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,140
right but this is a propolis right here

236
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,640
from a company from a brand that's in

237
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,000
Whole Foods or any other food health

238
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,580
food store everywhere across the land

239
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,380
it has alcohol in this propolis

240
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,260
a lot of it

241
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,839
it's cane sugar alcohol though but it's

242
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,459
cane sugar alcohol and then you'll

243
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,480
notice something about this propolisa

244
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,480
this is important to see

245
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
see how dark it is

246
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,779
take a look how dark it is

247
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,279
propolis

248
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,279
should never be dark

249
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,220
now you might think well maybe that's a

250
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,019
good thing you're getting a lot of it or

251
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,600
something or you're getting you know

252
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,240
there's a lot of propolis there's resin

253
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,600
what you're seeing right here

254
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,080
is burnt propolis

255
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,300
that's what you're saying burnt resin

256
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,220
it's useless

257
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,440
so if you went into the health food

258
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,019
store and you wanted to buy propolis and

259
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,160
you just bought a bottle of propolis and

260
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,160
it was dark like this

261
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,279
that's burnt

262
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,000
it's destroyed

263
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,940
that's what you're looking at right

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,680
there see this

265
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,779
this is going to be highly educational

266
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,339
episode right here I think it's

267
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,079
important that people know the truth of

268
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,839
what's going on because I think I had it

269
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,540
up to here actually with all the BS out

270
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,680
there to the degree that it is and

271
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,200
people who don't know what they're

272
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,420
talking about but what that is

273
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
is burnt propolis now here's another

274
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,019
thing you're looking at with this

275
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,019
propolis now this is a very well-known

276
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,480
brand that people have high respect for

277
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:14,519
out there get ready for this

278
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,860
guess what else you're seeing you're

279
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,459
seeing impurities

280
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,240
you're seeing impurities from a single

281
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,240
pass extraction

282
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,100
this is going to be mind-blowing

283
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,320
you might want to watch this episode

284
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,100
over again to be honest

285
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,860
this is single pass extraction what that

286
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,600
mean it means is heavy metals

287
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,760
impurities garbage and junk

288
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,079
is all still in there

289
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,339
so you go out there and you buy a

290
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
propolis and it looks like a dark

291
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,700
propolis and you're like oh my God that

292
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,640
looks pretty good first of all there's

293
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:56,579
alcohol even when they say there isn't

294
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,399
alcohol even when this one says there's

295
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:03,300
no alcohol and you actually open this up

296
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,339
and it is literally an alcohol

297
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,980
like

298
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,620
an alcoholic drink

299
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,779
like if you drink that

300
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,280
you'd be like boom

301
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,640
it hit you like a shot of whiskey

302
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,100
[Music]

303
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,360
so what you're seeing here

304
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:29,279
is dark propolis dark propolis is burnt

305
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:32,779
dark propolis is harboring impurities

306
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,779
lots of them metals

307
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:38,399
beeswax not the healthy stuff all

308
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:42,240
impurities

309
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,220
is going on in there so it is

310
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,440
filled with a whole bunch of different

311
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,920
stuff and junk that it shouldn't have

312
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,339
it's called single pass extraction

313
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,899
now when you're dealing with vermergy

314
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,260
propolis pure

315
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:00,420
you're looking at multi extraction

316
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,459
technology

317
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,959
that's the difference right there guess

318
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,399
what I don't care who puts out of

319
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,620
propolis out there I don't care who's

320
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,240
doing what with the propolis

321
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,399
I highly doubt it's going to be

322
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,700
multi-extraction technology

323
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,459
highly highly doubted and that's the

324
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,980
difference right there so that's the

325
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,980
Imaging now propolis here we are okay

326
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:31,260
all right and you'll take a look at this

327
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,600
golden golden color right here

328
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,300
see if you can see this I know I might

329
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,279
not be as close but

330
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,519
take a look right here

331
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:45,480
okay it's the golden color you see that

332
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,440
that's from multi extraction technology

333
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,500
it's leaving the bioactives leaving all

334
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,320
the bioactives but separating the

335
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,700
impurities separating the junk and the

336
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,100
garbage that I was talking about that's

337
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,100
in the other propolises this is so

338
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,339
important to know

339
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,459
propolis shouldn't be dark it shouldn't

340
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:12,000
be dark brown it shouldn't be black

341
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:16,079
that's single pass extraction that means

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,420
it's missing the extraction process is

343
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,560
missing it's letting all the impurities

344
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,139
go by it's letting all the toxins go by

345
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,540
and this right here and the reason why

346
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,160
people say this propolis is like a

347
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,440
miracle for their health a miracle for

348
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,180
them and works like nothing else for so

349
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,320
many things and reasons in their health

350
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,959
this is like a god-given miracle to have

351
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,699
this right now on the planet to have

352
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,160
this type of propolis because it doesn't

353
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,320
exist with the other companies it just

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,579
doesn't exist Juliet over there on

355
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,639
YouTube says

356
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:52,920
the vimorgy propolis cleared 16 ulcers

357
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,860
from my mouth it was the only thing that

358
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,980
worked you're not the only one I I heard

359
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,240
or hear out there say what it does for

360
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,360
ulcers in the mouth

361
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,459
it's unbelievable what it does

362
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,980
and so I'm showing you right here a

363
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,680
god-given miracle in the supplement

364
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,779
realm right here which is the propolis

365
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,600
now if you just got on here you just got

366
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,300
to know that beverage is giving a free

367
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,060
bottle of propolis away and a free

368
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,579
bottle of lemon balm away with 200 order

369
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,940
of emergy.com

370
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:30,360
so Julie over there in IG says provolas

371
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:33,360
healed a cold sore in two days

372
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
OMG

373
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,199
it's that incredible now take a look at

374
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,839
the difference ready I'm going to keep

375
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,959
on putting more in here so this is the

376
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,920
golden extract right there it's called

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,260
multi extraction technology

378
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,360
peace and veggies says propolis pure by

379
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,320
vimorigi has healed my mouth thank you

380
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,079
vimergy and guess what

381
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,959
just think about that think about like

382
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,519
what that is what that even is how

383
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,760
incredible that is

384
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,139
so

385
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,320
all right so I wanted to show you that

386
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:13,320
there's so much to talk about you guys

387
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,940
so let's get into it a little bit deeper

388
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,459
let's talk about this a little bit more

389
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,380
I'm very excited right now

390
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,199
for a lot of reasons

391
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,660
Renata 144 says over there on YouTube aw

392
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:26,399
there are people who buy alcohol-based

393
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,399
subs and believe they can burn the

394
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,740
alcohol off of it by cooking it not sure

395
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,779
can you please speak to that to clarify

396
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,180
for the community I talk about that in

397
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:38,100
medical medium books by the way and yes

398
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,100
you can't get rid of the alcohol by

399
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,199
heating it up doesn't work the residue

400
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,959
of the alcohol is still there the herbs

401
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,779
are still damaged alcohol damages the

402
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,980
herbs so it destroys them very important

403
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,899
to know alcohol and tinctures

404
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,120
annihilates the phytochemical compounds

405
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,060
the things that we need the bioactives

406
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,620
it injures them so even if you're

407
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,360
somebody like well I'll burn off some of

408
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,179
the alcohol somehow by heating it up

409
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,280
basically what that means is you have to

410
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,620
get such a heat to burn off the alcohol

411
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,740
where you have to light it basically on

412
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:16,140
fire so you have to go super hot

413
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,939
super hot to try to burn the alcohol out

414
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,860
of those alcoholic tinctures if you're

415
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,919
going that hot you've just destroyed

416
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,500
your herbal tincture you just destroyed

417
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,939
the constituents the phytochemical

418
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,760
compounds the bioactives you just

419
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,419
completely annihilated that by being

420
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,400
fooled and tricked by being told you can

421
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,440
burn it off and then you'll be fine

422
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,600
these are the mistakes made out there

423
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,059
but that's the problem and that's why

424
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,520
people don't heal because all of these

425
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,320
checks and balances aren't there people

426
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,140
are in the dark they don't know what's

427
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,360
going on with their products and healing

428
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,700
and things they need or detoxing or

429
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,640
what's not detoxing and what is they

430
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,860
have no idea and all of this including

431
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,559
things like yeah using supplements out

432
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,919
with alcohol can slow down healing and

433
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,679
it even reverse healing so alcohol in

434
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,940
products even can reverse healing so

435
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,679
you're somebody that's trying to heal

436
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,840
you you think you're doing something

437
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,740
good for yourself and you're taking all

438
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,260
these supplements without alcohol

439
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,020
calling them and you're going backwards

440
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:20,580
because of it that's that's how it works

441
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,559
so

442
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,760
mind-blowing information let's go a

443
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,220
little deeper

444
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,559
so I just showed you a propolis

445
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,080
that's dark

446
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,780
and I showed you why because the

447
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,840
propolis is burnt

448
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,340
that's why not just burnt

449
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,380
but also

450
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,760
it's got all the impurities in there too

451
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,740
now you're looking at the difference

452
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
right there

453
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,520
you're seeing right here the propolis

454
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,559
pure

455
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,440
with the multi-extraction technology

456
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,299
what that means is it takes out

457
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,880
impurities

458
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,880
but leaves the bioactives

459
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,340
the other propolis is out there single

460
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,660
pass extraction they let all the garbage

461
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,240
pass through

462
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,340
it hinders the bioactives

463
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,400
so we got that right there critical to

464
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,160
know if you guys just got on there on

465
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,500

478
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,580
71 dollars free product I don't see

479
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,919
other companies doing this out there I

480
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,620
just don't see it especially the quality

481
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,299
here we're talking about Dr Fawn said he

482
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,660
is absolutely plugging the product

483
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:04,020
because it works my patient used it

484
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:06,000
topically to heal his rashes when the

485
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,059
prescriptions from the dermatologist

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,780
never work thank you Dr fun

487
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:14,160
so it's important to know something okay

488
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,960
there are ways to do plugs for

489
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,539
supplements and things like that there

490
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,539
are ways to do different stuff but in

491
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:24,419
this situation here I'm showing you how

492
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,340
incredible and how different the

493
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,419
vermergy products are compared to what's

494
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,760
out there

495
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,400
because I see it all day long I see

496
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,260
people getting propolis out there that's

497
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,960
filled with alcohol

498
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,820
or it's burnt or it's got all the

499
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,980
impurities and it's got all three it's

500
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,460
burnt impurities and has alcohol in it

501
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,340
and it's a shame it's truly a sin it's

502
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,600
really a shame and nobody knows it and

503
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,460
they're just walking around blind

504
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,900
they're ripped off no one's telling them

505
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,460
anything and they're not moving

506
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,059
themselves forward the healing process

507
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:59,460
now that's just the Stark truth and it's

508
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:01,440
critical for people to know and yeah I

509
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,120
support vimergy and for these reasons

510
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,520
because that doesn't exist with other

511
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,080
companies so yes I'm gonna plug them and

512
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm going to talk about them and I'm

513
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,740
going to share this information it's

514
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,820
critical Dr Sherry green over there on

515
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,299
IG

516
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,480
propolis pure is phenomenal for so many

517
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:22,020
conditions love it for my patients

518
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,520
so I'm on the propolis pure talk I want

519
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,640
to get into that a little bit it's a

520
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,100
multi- extraction technology to separate

521
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,539
the undesirable compounds critical to

522
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,659
know

523
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:36,480
that's a big deal all on its own

524
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,640
so it removes it's a removal system of

525
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,720
unwanted purities like toxic heavy

526
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,659
metals and all these other different

527
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,740
things that's what's so great about that

528
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,260
process

529
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,520
these propolises and there's plenty of

530
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,200
them out there I've literally probably

531
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,960
purchased almost every single propolis

532
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,179
that is out there at least every one

533
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,140
that's popular everyone that's on the

534
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,419
Shelf

535
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,340
and I've gone through them all

536
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,539
and they're loaded with junk and garbage

537
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,740
they're either burnt they got the

538
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,539
impurities

539
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,580
or they're just loaded with alcohol and

540
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,840
the thing is is there's alcohol in all

541
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,340
the propolises out there and maybe

542
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,140
there's one that might not have it but

543
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,240
here's the trick the ones that say they

544
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,880
don't have it still have the alcohol in

545
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,980
it hidden ingredients

546
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,659
and alcohol is one of the hidden

547
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,740
ingredients they also hide natural

548
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:27,360
flavors now they hide preservatives they

549
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,659
hide all that stuff so let's go into

550
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,020
lemon balm a little bit

551
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:36,299
move these aside right

552
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,640
the not good propolis so moving that

553
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:40,640
over all right let's hit the lemon balm

554
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,400
so let's go into this a little bit so I

555
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:48,840
have a lemon balm that's very popular

556
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,640
here it is in my hand

557
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,500
I bet you a bunch of people even

558
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,840
watching this or that are going to watch

559
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,120
this have this lemon balm they don't

560
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,640
know the brand but I'm sure they have it

561
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,260
it's a very popular brand and most

562
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,360
people buy this they just go into the

563
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,520
store and they buy this brand so this is

564
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,659
a lemon balm right here

565
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,520
okay

566
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:13,860
so this lemon balm is a three to one

567
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,419
a three to one

568
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,539
keep that in mind

569
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:21,780
that that's its strength it's three to

570
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:24,360
one okay you'll see this one's dark

571
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,220
but lemon balm

572
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,520
should be dark

573
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,559
it should be keep that in mind but this

574
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,100
is going to blow your mind

575
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:38,460
lemon balm should be dark

576
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,500
because of the herb itself

577
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,299
so as you can see

578
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,140
I put the dark

579
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:48,960
Herb in here

580
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,659
but that's three to one

581
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,720
it shouldn't be that dark

582
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,720
and that's scary

583
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,200
gotta think about that for a minute

584
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,780
it shouldn't be that dark

585
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,760
why is it that dark

586
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,220
hidden ingredients

587
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,500
hidden impurities

588
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,659
very important to know

589
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,340
and I'm gonna go into depth about this

590
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,340
on on the lemon balm front okay

591
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,140
so it's memory lemon balm right there

592
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,659
it's supposed to be dark

593
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,340
keep that in mind

594
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,700
and you're probably like well what's he

595
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,700
saying

596
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,940
remember she

597
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,940
lemon balm is ten to one

598
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,840
ten to one

599
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,840
think about that strength difference

600
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,740
so let's go into this

601
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,520
lemon balm is supposed to be dark

602
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,520
and here's that brand

603
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,520
look how dark it is

604
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,100
but it's three to one

605
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,559
it's not supposed to be that dark

606
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,559
it's supposed to be a lot lighter than

607
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,120
beverages ten to one

608
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,120
which is really high potency

609
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,960
if your mind isn't blown

610
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,120
I don't know what to say I don't know

611
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,820
what else I can do

612
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,380
this is a really important piece of

613
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,760
information right here in the supplement

614
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,919
world

615
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,840
and yes I'm the only one talking about

616
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,059
this out there

617
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,860
the only one and I noticed the

618
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,360
supplement companies and the influencers

619
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,440
that work for supplement companies and

620
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,600
all that stuff

621
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,880
they won't go near any of this kind of

622
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,260
talk because their companies are guilty

623
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,500
of so much

624
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,480
they won't go near any of this

625
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,559
very important and it's also why I'm

626
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,140
hated

627
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,740
by competitors out there

628
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:01,740
they hate how incredible all this is and

629
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,640
how it shows them up so take a look once

630
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,500
again

631
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
I'm going to take the popular company

632
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,919
and

633
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,679
it's like this all around

634
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,140
I purchased so many lemon bombs from the

635
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,580
best companies so called out there

636
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,580
so ready here we go

637
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,100
that's the lemon balm from a popular

638
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,059
company and you guys are watching how

639
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,400
dark that is but what is mind-blowing

640
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:31,440
is that's a three to one ratio which

641
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:36,980
isn't that strong

642
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,980
then what the hell is in there

643
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,279
that is the question hidden additives

644
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,940
hidden ingredients that are not

645
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,919
disclosed junk and impurities what the

646
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,960
hell is in there

647
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,600
okay

648
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,480
very important to know because this is

649
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,179
the vimorges

650
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,200
that's the vimorges

651
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:03,200
lemon balm

652
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,860
it's not as dark

653
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,120
but

654
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,679
it's ten to one

655
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,500
stronger

656
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,720
this is three to one

657
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,320
do you see how dark that is and this is

658
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,320
ten to one

659
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,520
look at that

660
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,620
that's less impurities less additives

661
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,779
less junk

662
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,059
whatever's in here

663
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,340
is scary

664
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,539
because a three to one can never be that

665
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,860
dark do you guys know what I'm talking

666
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,960
about

667
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,179
so yeah all the lemon balm tinctures out

668
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,679
there and all the new companies putting

669
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,539
out lemon bombs because they they

670
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,080
because it got trendy because of medical

671
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:48,080
medium

672
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:51,900
it's like this and I'm going to show you

673
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,760
another version of lemon balm that's

674
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,320
lighter and it's scary for a whole

675
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,340
nother reason so I can't wait to show

676
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,299
you that

677
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,299
so here we go

678
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,220
so that's the difference right there

679
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,220
okay

680
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,340
next let's go into another aspect of it

681
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,840
so that's a lemon balm right there

682
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,000
all right

683
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,840
here's a lemon balm a different lemon

684
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,840
balm right here

685
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,480
okay

686
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,659
all right

687
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,539
this is a lemon balm that tells you

688
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,580
nothing it doesn't tell you it's a three

689
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:37,980
to one it doesn't tell you it's in

690
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,679
anything it doesn't tell you

691
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,620
how many milligrams it doesn't tell you

692
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,240
anything this is a lemon balm that

693
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,159
someone will go out and buy because it's

694
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,880
a popular brand it's out there on the

695
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,380
Shelf

696
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,940
and they'll buy it thinking they're

697
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,340
getting themselves better I heard lemon

698
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,620
balms good for medical medium I heard it

699
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,419
does all this and all that he talks

700
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,360
about it in his book let me go to the

701
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:03,539
store let me buy a lemon balm and then

702
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:06,799
they buy one take a look at this lemon

703
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,799
balm is supposed to be dark

704
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,159
that's not dark

705
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,840
now that's scary all in its own

706
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,400
what does that mean

707
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,400
that means this company

708
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,760
is doing something who only knows

709
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:28,380
it's either they have so very little

710
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,659
lemon bomb and someone's being ripped

711
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,260
off so everybody buying this lemon balm

712
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:37,559
tincture that I won't show you the brand

713
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:41,580
they're being ripped off look at that

714
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:44,299
do you see it's supposed to be dark

715
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,299
but yet

716
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,600
unlike this one which is really dark

717
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,899
this isn't supposed to be that dark

718
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,659
because this is just a three to one

719
00:29:54,899 --> 00:30:01,919
so this one here is

720
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:04,500
spooky this one here is spooky

721
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,919
because lemon balm tincture is supposed

722
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,100
to be dark but this is golden

723
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,399
and on the bottle it doesn't tell you

724
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,980
to what degree of lemon balm is actually

725
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,820
in there so that's anything from

726
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,159
impurities hidden ingredients to very

727
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,500
little lemon balm

728
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,299
someone takes it they don't see a result

729
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,399
and now they're not getting better

730
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,899
someone takes it they don't see any

731
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:32,760
improvements they don't see anything

732
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:35,960
happening or changing

733
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,960
and they don't get better

734
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,960
fly on the wall if I only was a fly on

735
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,840
the wall

736
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,840
in everybody's house and saw all the

737
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,000
mistakes all the tricks all the rip-offs

738
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,520
it's just unbelievable

739
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,159
so over there on YouTube

740
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,080
Edie says can you speak to the fact that

741
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,039
bemidji's products

742
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,640
formally contained alcohol in years past

743
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:05,940
huh beverages products never contained

744
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,220
alcohol and any years passed since the

745
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,919
Inception of that company to this very

746
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:15,140
day that's false information and that's

747
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:15,140
how rumors are started purposely

748
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,720
and that's sad because that's what's

749
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,580
happening right now and there is an

750
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,520
attack on Bemidji because of the quality

751
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,640
being so good because it's unbelievable

752
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,380
stuff it's god-given in my opinion from

753
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,799
what I've seen

754
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,299
and it's that incredible and companies

755
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,880
can't keep up with it they can't match

756
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:42,360
it they can't on any level

757
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,840
and that's why there's so much trouble

758
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,220
out there with rumors and and fals

759
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,720
cities and all of that all right so

760
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,460
let's go into this a little bit deeper

761
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,240
now with some other stuff so I showed

762
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,440
you

763
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,059
the lemon mom with the light color

764
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,460
brand a lot of people have it in their

765
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:00,600
cupboard I can guarantee so many people

766
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,700
have it

767
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,559
it's light because there's hardly any

768
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,860
lemon balm and there's something else in

769
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,720
here instead which is really sad

770
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,919
here's the dark lemon balm but it's

771
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,440
three to one but it's pitch dark which

772
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,320
means something's wrong here

773
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,659
it's not supposed to be that dark it

774
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,399
means a lot of impurities a lot of junk

775
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,799
and garbage in there and then the

776
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,720
propolises with the alcohol the

777
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,600
propolises that say they're alcohol free

778
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,460
but they're not alcohol free how are

779
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,200
they allowed to do this they just are

780
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,320
and that's how the supplement World

781
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,659
Works anybody can basically put out

782
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,760
almost anything without checks and

783
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:44,159
balances so that's important to

784
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,919
understand all on its own there is so

785
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,559
much alcohol in these propolises this

786
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,299
one is off the charts you smell it and

787
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,620
you can get drunk that's how insanely

788
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,000
entrenched in alcohol that that

789
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,159
supplement is

790
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,700
it's insane

791
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,620
so I just want to go over a couple of

792
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,059
different cool things here about all of

793
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,679
this because this is important so let me

794
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,559
just remind everybody a hundred dollars

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,179

796
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,519

nervous system

800
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,460
nervous system

801
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,799

mind-blowing 71 dollars

right there take advantage of this stuff

808
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,779
when it happens like this take advantage

809
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,059
of those kinds of sales those kinds of

810
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:50,159
offers that are out there but you got to

811
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:52,440
use the code go to imagery.com check out

812
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,679
the code that's something I could stand

813
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,779
behind it's a company I can stand behind

814
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,360
because of what they do and their

815
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:03,179
process so I want to remind people

816
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,600
I'll go deeper into this so propolis

817
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:08,639
pure contains over 50 percent of the

818
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,320
bioactives

819
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,619
it's critical to know that the

820
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,980
polyphenols over 50 percent active

821
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:19,500
bioactive polyphenols like quercetin and

822
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,440
other polyphenols important to know

823
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:25,320
that is part of the multi-extraction

824
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,859
technology to get rid of impurities but

825
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,879
preserve the bile actives very important

826
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:33,240
to know

827
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,399
and immune system is critical

828
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,919
heartlight says there I'm a clinician

829
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm a clinical psychologist

830
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,899
and the Bemidji supplements are critical

831
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,619
for mental health as well amazing over

832
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,619
there on IG

833
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,780
I think what happens is that people

834
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,460
don't realize when they invest into

835
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,800
something that they're using on their

836
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,660
body or inside their body they don't

837
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,820
know really what's going on there

838
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,060
because there was a law passed that

839
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,680
allows companies to not disclose they

840
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,660
don't have to disclose hidden

841
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,859
ingredients a certain percentage of

842
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,140
hidden ingredients in their

843
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:13,800
supplementation

844
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,200
and no one talks about this

845
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,540
I'm the only one I've seen out there

846
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,740
talking about this the reason why is

847
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,720
because

848
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,460
supplement companies and influencers

849
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,800
that either own supplement companies are

850
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,960
starting their own supplement companies

851
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,240
they're not going to say oh we don't we

852
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,220
don't have hidden you know percentages

853
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,320
and they're not going to say that

854
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,760
because what they do is if you have a

855
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,859
bunch of money you can go start a

856
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,260
supplement company tomorrow if you had a

857
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,420
bunch of money you can go and say okay I

858
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,280
will go to this manufacturing place they

859
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,960
will put it together for me I want this

860
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,900
this

861
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,820
you know and they put it together and

862
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,099
they don't have they don't have control

863
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,380
over the hidden ingredients that are in

864
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,720
there they don't know how to say hey

865
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,820
don't put that in ours don't put that in

866
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,020
this company make sure you do this make

867
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,119
sure you do that look for the highest

868
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,760
quality they don't do that it's kind of

869
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,619
like they just Stamp Out supplements for

870
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,900
influencers these days that want to

871
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,480
start companies tomorrow and they stamp

872
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,720
it out is what they do as long as that

873
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,240
influencer is wealthy rich or has a

874
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,560
bunch of money or something somehow and

875
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,320
they want to start their supplement

876
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,119
company they just literally oh it's just

877
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,420
like it's like clothing brands you can

878
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,099
go and get your clothing lines made

879
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,660
right to what's out there to what the

880
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,920
the clothing manufacturers be like all

881
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,240
right we'll put your name on it we'll

882
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,400
put the name of your company on and

883
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,320
we'll put it out there

884
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,300
but people don't realize in the

885
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,480
supplement world they're filled with all

886
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,920
these impurities hidden ingredients

887
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,480
undisclosed ingredients

888
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,980
and that's what's happening out there

889
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,980
and it's really sad

890
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,859
so

891
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,660
it's important to know how it works I

892
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:57,599
want to go into propolis a little bit I

893
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:01,020
think really that it deserves and flim

894
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,619
bum it deserves a spotlight

895
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,619
so

896
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,599
one of the major problems people suffer

897
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,760
with is immune system issues

898
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,440
anybody who's got an autoimmune

899
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,540
diagnosis or any kind of other problem

900
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,460
anything going on with their immune

901
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,920
system any kind of symptoms they're

902
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,300
struggling immune system wise

903
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,300
and that's important to know

904
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:29,460
and so what I like about propolis it's

905
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:31,859
one of these Miracles that we have on

906
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,540
this planet that supports the immune

907
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,480
system

908
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,680
and so it's critical you have the purest

909
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,260
kind

910
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,300
out there that you can find

911
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,060
to actually help

912
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:47,099
support the immune system

913
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,720
and that's a big deal so we're up

914
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,460
against all kinds of exposures out there

915
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,160
every day we're up against all kinds of

916
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,220
pathogens we're up against all kinds of

917
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,119
different impurities different toxins

918
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:02,520
and the more load we have on us

919
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,160
the more our immune system has to kill

920
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,560
itself to clean it up

921
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,420
so we take our immune systems for

922
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,339
granted without realizing it many of us

923
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,920
take take our immune systems for granted

924
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:16,920
and don't realize that our immune cells

925
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,680
are these garbage eaters

926
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,020
inside our body so they're there to go

927
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,520
after pathogens and eat up pathogens our

928
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,820
immune cells are there to go after

929
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:30,359
impurities and garbage and junk

930
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,040
and to eat it up chemicals metals and

931
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,220
everything else our immune cells are

932
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,820
there to eat these things

933
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,220
so that these things don't affect us as

934
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,520
much or so bad

935
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,980
and so what I like about propolis is it

936
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,900
supports the immune system feeds the

937
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,700
immune system

938
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,440
and that's critical if someone's

939
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,320
actually struggling with anything that's

940
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,480
why it deserves a spotlight

941
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,940
and propolis was

942
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:05,640
just kind of like this Niche obscure

943
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:09,000
novelty thing and people did not know

944
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,560
really what it does how good it is how

945
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,760
supportive it is

946
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,760
in the health movement

947
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,640
Tara says I've tried so many supplements

948
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,980
over the years most of them actually

949
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,480
made my symptoms worse Bemidji

950
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,400
supplements are incredible and actually

951
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,960
help me you can really tell the

952
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,520
difference in quality

953
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,079
and there is a difference because when

954
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,599
it comes down to people so many people

955
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,119
are sensitive they're sensitive for a

956
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,680
lot of reasons

957
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,900
and

958
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,359
if they do take supplements that have

959
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,579
alcohol in them and natural flavors

960
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,859
and all kinds of different toxic toxic

961
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,480
additives and they don't you know it's

962
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,099
in there and they don't know it and

963
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,640
they're taking these supplements they'll

964
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,079
instantly blame the herb or what the

965
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,540
name of it is

966
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,820
so if they take a toxic lemon balm and

967
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,160
there's so many of them out there

968
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,200
and they take a lemon balm that has

969
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,940
alcohol in it or a lemon balm that has

970
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,260
natural flavors or a lemon balm that has

971
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,119
all this other junk and garbage or

972
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,800
hidden ingredients and they take it and

973
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,839
they're like well it's not working it's

974
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,540
not helping me in fact I feel a little

975
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,000
bit sensitive it's because of everything

976
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:18,240
that's in there that shouldn't be in

977
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,800
there that they don't know is in there

978
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,780
so

979
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,940
um by the way what I normally do with

980
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,180
beverages lemon balm is I take a dropper

981
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,579
full and I put it right here

982
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,000
in some water and some honey

983
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,920
so that's how I usually do

984
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,900
this is actually a big mug right here

985
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,660
that's usually how I do like my lemon

986
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,619
balm tea now is I take

987
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,900
the lemon balm now this is an important

988
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,079
um important piece of information about

989
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,820
the lemon balm it's ten to one so you

990
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,920
got to think about it if you pick lemon

991
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,660
balm out of your garden if you pick it

992
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,280
out by hand

993
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,500
and you just get your lemon balm out of

994
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,180
the garden and you dry it

995
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,640
and you have a portion of that lemon

996
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,260
balm like a whole bunch of dried lemon

997
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,260
balm leaves that's one

998
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,420
that's one

999
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:14,940
ten to one is ten of those

1000
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:18,380
so that's important to know ten of one

1001
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:23,280
ten of ten to one is ten of those

1002
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,300
handfuls of herbs and that ten to one is

1003
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,920
in here

1004
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,920
right in the dropper

1005
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:35,099
this one here

1006
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,599
with the hidden ingredients and the

1007
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:39,359
impurities

1008
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:43,560
is a three to one

1009
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,800
so it's only three of these instead of

1010
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,800
ten

1011
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,740
all right so

1012
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,660
um I'm gonna take a little sip here and

1013
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,000
we'll keep on going a little bit because

1014
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,200
this is incredible information you're

1015
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,920
growing your own lemon balm that's

1016
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,099
that's incredible

1017
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,099
so good

1018
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,520
okay

1019
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,000
so I think we're people what people

1020
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,579
don't realize

1021
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,160
is they'll hear something out there like

1022
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:20,339
lemon balm is good

1023
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,560
but they don't know how much more there

1024
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:25,380
is to learn about it they'll go out and

1025
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,660
they'll buy a lemon balm tincture

1026
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,180
it doesn't work

1027
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,540
and then they move they move on I tried

1028
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,099
lemon balm it did nothing for me and now

1029
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,540
they have that experience and they have

1030
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:38,400
that reference

1031
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,960
and that reference can travel to

1032
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,880
somebody else

1033
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,920
it's like oh you tried lemon bomb yeah

1034
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,500
it didn't work for me doesn't work I

1035
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,060
tried it and then this next person goes

1036
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,680
oh okay well then I'm not going to try

1037
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,200
it either because

1038
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,180
it didn't work for you so it's probably

1039
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,400
not going to work for me and then that

1040
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,560
person goes and tells another person oh

1041
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,660
you tried lemon yeah no one doesn't work

1042
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,160
I didn't have to try it I just know it

1043
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,140
doesn't work

1044
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,240
and then it goes on Down the Line like

1045
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,460
that meanwhile it all stems from someone

1046
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,400
taking

1047
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,839
an unproductive lemon balm that didn't

1048
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,579
do the trick that didn't help that

1049
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,880
didn't work

1050
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:21,300
and so this is the problem in the health

1051
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,680
world it's how we can then just go like

1052
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,880
where do we go and then we go to

1053
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,579
something else then we go to something

1054
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,280
else and it's endless I think one of the

1055
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,260
most disheartening parts of the herbal

1056
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,760
tincture world is the alcohol and

1057
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,339
tinctures and I think medical medium

1058
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:40,319
information really blew that wide open

1059
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:42,000
where alcohol is avoided in a lot of

1060
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,440
tinctures now because of medical meme

1061
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,359
information

1062
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,099
which leads me to something else I want

1063
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,619
to say

1064
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,460
wondering Wishin says I tried an organic

1065
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,800
sink

1066
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:54,839
when first starting medical medium after

1067
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,859
four days I stopped it made me feel

1068
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:58,380
worse

1069
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:00,599
after aw talked about supplement quality

1070
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,900
I tried memories Inc and wow and it was

1071
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:06,900
a game changer can change everything I

1072
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,480
remember back in the day liquid sinks

1073
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,760
with so much citrus acid and there still

1074
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,440
is liquid zincs with so much citric acid

1075
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,180
in there which is also hidden in a lot

1076
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,339
of um the tinctures hidden in the

1077
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,800
supplements citric acid is like in

1078
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:22,319
everything it's not in memory but it's

1079
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,800
in everything out there and I I recall

1080
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,020
so many people taking zinc the liquid

1081
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,119
zinc from reputable companies on the

1082
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,440
store shelf and they buy it and they

1083
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,280
squirt it in their mouth and they throw

1084
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,079
up

1085
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,420
they just vomit

1086
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,060
just projectile vomit

1087
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,220
it literally turns their stomach in a

1088
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,140
second they get sick and they just puke

1089
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,819
and that's it and that's the reference

1090
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,920
right there with zinc

1091
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:49,740
from there on out they're just gonna be

1092
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,599
like I can't take zinc meanwhile zinc is

1093
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,579
so critical

1094
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,319
for the healing process and so critical

1095
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,859
for the immune system but that person

1096
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,619
may never actually take a zinc again

1097
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:04,260
to help them heal and to be one of those

1098
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,000
people where look I just you know and I

1099
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,380
tried zinc it doesn't work and then they

1100
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,940
tell somebody else it doesn't work so I

1101
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,319
want to talk about vimergy as far as

1102
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,980
what they have in here

1103
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:16,619
they got organic glycerin in their

1104
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,780
tincture bottles

1105
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:21,960
organic glycerin

1106
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,760
but there's a word next to it

1107
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,339
it's flax

1108
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,260
this is advanced

1109
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:30,060
this is a big deal

1110
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,500
and this is another reason why I stand

1111
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,540
behind these guys there's so many

1112
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,760
reasons why I stand behind these guys

1113
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,940
you can't touch this stuff other

1114
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,920
companies out there can't touch this

1115
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,800
it's not touchable

1116
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,359
what you'll see is organic glycerin

1117
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,319
and then you'll see the word flax

1118
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,240
f-l-a

1119
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,339
right X

1120
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:58,380
important to know

1121
00:45:53,339 --> 00:46:00,119
so it's not junk garbage

1122
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,859
glycerin

1123
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:03,599
so you got two options in the tincture

1124
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,980
world if you want to try to heal and do

1125
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,240
stuff if you want to use Herbal

1126
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:09,180
tinctures to try to move yourself

1127
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,920
forward get two options it's alcohol or

1128
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,640
glycerin those are your options out

1129
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,440
there

1130
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,420
how he says can all the supplements be

1131
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,980
taken at once that's look that's how I

1132
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,200
do it ask your doctor what's right for

1133
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,079
you Holly but that's what I do

1134
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:27,000
I'll take them at once

1135
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:30,300
so there's two options we have

1136
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,740
if you want to look into the supplement

1137
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,720
world

1138
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,460
in the tincture world

1139
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:40,680
it's alcohol or glycerin

1140
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,579
archangelica says yes I puked from a low

1141
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,579
quality zinc

1142
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,720
you know the sad part is is I hate to

1143
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,700
say this over and over again but I

1144
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,560
talked about this many years ago how

1145
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,119
people puke from their low quality zincs

1146
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,040
but nobody talked about it was like a

1147
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,920
hidden dirty Secret

1148
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:02,599
Rosie said yes several zincs gave me

1149
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,599
gave many nausea

1150
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,839
so

1151
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,119
Lindsay says all other zinc Brands I've

1152
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:11,579
tried made me feel super nauseous and

1153
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,339
sick memories Inc is the only one I can

1154
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:18,260
take and feel fine

1155
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,260
that says so much

1156
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,640
so I just want to say back to this and

1157
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,040
Jackie says I now keep lemon balm in my

1158
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:28,680
purse for anxiety I tell people keep it

1159
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,359
in their purse keep it in their bag keep

1160
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,880

product

1168
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,480
that's insane I don't know how they do

1169
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:58,020
it Christina says I have used zinc since

1170
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,560
2011 for my alopecia and they always

1171
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,720
made me so what a bar face it was it

1172
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,940
wasn't before vimorgy zinc that I did

1173
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,339
not get that vimergy zinc is the best

1174
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,599
one out there used it in the past four

1175
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,880
years now

1176
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,020
incredible so I want to go back to the

1177
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,020
glycerin process

1178
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,839
if you're going to take any tinctures at

1179
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,460
all if you're going to go to anybody and

1180
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,660
take tinctures if you're going to buy

1181
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,040
anything out there if you're going to

1182
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,900
talk to an herbalist if you're going to

1183
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,240
talk to a brand new supplement company

1184
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,819
that just put out some tinctures

1185
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,400
you got two options

1186
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:35,240
glycerin

1187
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,240
or alcohol

1188
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,480
both are bad

1189
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:42,180
unless the glycerin

1190
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,000
is flax because chances are it's going

1191
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:48,180
to be a really low quality glycerin

1192
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,280
that's not flax

1193
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,480
you don't even know where it is and what

1194
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,400
it is I mean you don't know what it's

1195
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,319
dry from or where it comes from and

1196
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,700
that's the problem even when talking to

1197
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:59,579
supplement companies be like well what's

1198
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,740
your glycerin made from whatever

1199
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,880
they'll still kind of have this like

1200
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,880
spew

1201
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,760
but in the end it's bulk glycerin

1202
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,260
and you don't know really the true story

1203
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,599
behind it

1204
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,839
and when I take the Bemidji supplements

1205
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:18,359
I know this organic glycerin is flax

1206
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,819
derived and that right there gives me a

1207
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,920
good night's sleep all on its own that's

1208
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:25,560
a big deal I don't see that out there

1209
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,920
and that's huge all on its own you guys

1210
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:31,260
I mean seriously

1211
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,119
it's just incredible

1212
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,800
it really is

1213
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,240
so I wanted to run those things by you

1214
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,240
guys to let you know that there's a sale

1215
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,980

1216
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,780
giveaway I don't know what to call it

1217
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,720
it's a giveaway

1218
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,839
it's they're giving away 71 dollars of

1219
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,420
product for a 200 order

and it's the propolis pure and the lemon

1221
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:57,420
balm and if you want like I tell people

1222
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:00,500
you don't have to know everything about

1223
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,700
your healing process or everything about

1224
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:05,280
products in the world you don't have to

1225
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:08,099
know everything but you got to know at

1226
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,420
least the foundations and what I see out

1227
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:11,040
there is people don't know the

1228
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,079
foundations

1229
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,660
you don't have that part and they don't

1230
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,740
know that part and that's tricky for so

1231
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:20,099
many

1232
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,260
they don't have the foundational aspects

1233
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:23,940
of their health and healing and the

1234
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,260
products and the stuff they're ingesting

1235
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,560
and what they're putting inside their

1236
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:31,380
body they have a lot of misinformation

1237
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,119
and they suffer because of it and they

1238
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:36,060
end up on the Merry-Go-Round because of

1239
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,920

so good so I tell people

1255
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,300
just simply I know people are busy in

1256
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:27,119
their life they got a lot going on and

1257
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,579
it's hard to learn everything it's hard

1258
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,260
to learn a lot of things because you're

1259
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:32,880
multitasking you've got a lot of

1260
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,760
responsibilities there's so much being

1261
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,319
asked of everybody in life right so what

1262
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,319
I do is I simplify it

1263
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,220
nervous system I don't even call lemon

1264
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,319
bomb lemon balm I call it central

1265
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,359
nervous system

1266
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:51,720
that's what I call it

1267
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:53,880
so I changed the name of lemon balm

1268
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,300
in my head

1269
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,740
in my life in my mind and then propolis

1270
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,240
I don't even call it propolis anymore I

1271
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,800
call it immune system

1272
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,960
I mean that's what I call it of course

1273
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,180
this is just propolis and it's not your

1274
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,740
immune system isn't in that bottle but I

1275
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:10,140
call it immune system and that's what I

1276
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,619
do it's these simple things too that

1277
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,780
like they they just remind you of what

1278
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:18,359
you're doing for yourself

1279
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:21,359
and that's a big big deal too it's the

1280
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:23,160
connection of it like I'm helping my

1281
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:26,460
nervous system

1282
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:28,980
that connection alone is so powerful I'm

take it daily until memory

1304
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:16,800
because

00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:18,839
all those impurities and and added added

1306
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,460
ingredients that people don't know about

1307
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:25,619
that are added undisclosed not disclosed

that word quality because everybody uses

1312
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:41,099
it when they don't have quality

1313
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,660
or their quality is low but they don't

1314
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:45,359
have to say low like supplement

1315
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:48,300
companies can say quality we choose

1316
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,460
quality from the finest places

1317
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,140
but really the quality they're choosing

1318
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,400
is low quality they don't have to say

1319
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,619

is attacking your body your organs

1375

just let them tell you but that's not

1376
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:16,200
accurate it's misinformation it's been

1377
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,500
happening since the 1950s

1378
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:22,680
misinformation literally since the 1950s

1379
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:27,480
our body's immune system does not attack

1380
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:29,579
organs it does not attack ourselves

1381
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,280
it doesn't attack

1382
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:35,940
our body our glands our immune system

1383
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:37,500
goes after pathogens and Invaders and

1384
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,119
that's what's happening and then

1385
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,839
pathogens

1386
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,420
and Invaders are what inflames us that's

1387
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:48,059
what goes after our organs and glands

1388
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,740
so if you're somebody that's you know

1389
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:51,300
coming into a place where like what's

1390
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,740
going on my body's just destroying

1391
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,800
itself my body's immune system is

1392
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:58,980
attacking itself that's so outdated old

1393
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:01,140
crap misinformation was never

1394
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:05,460
scientifically proven ever under a

1395
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:07,800
microscope it was nothing but a theory

1396
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,839
keep that in mind

1397
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,700
but it's important to know that our

1398
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:13,619
bodies love us and unconditionally and

1399
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:15,780
they look out for us and we just have to

1400
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:17,520
give our bodies what it needs we have to

1401
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,020
support our bodies so our bodies can

1402
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,579
actually do what they need to do our

1403
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,619
immune system can do what it needs to do

1404
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:25,099
and that's a big part of the healing

1405
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:25,099
process

1406
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,140
something always to remember that your

1407
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:34,020
body isn't faulty it's not letting you

1408
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:36,059
down it's not turning against you you

1409

1412
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:47,460
kicking your legs out from underneath

1413
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,220
