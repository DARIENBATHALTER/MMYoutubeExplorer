[0.24 - 3.04] okay
[1.20 - 5.04] telegram
[3.04 - 5.92] facebook youtube tick tock we're live
[5.04 - 8.96] right now we're talking about
[5.92 - 11.04] plant-based versus animal base and we're
[8.96 - 14.80] gonna talk about the difference between
[11.04 - 16.56] plant-based medical medium style
[14.80 - 18.64] animal protein
[16.56 - 19.76] medical medium style
[18.64 - 21.28] because you could be on an animal
[19.76 - 22.96] protein diet a clean one or you can be
[21.28 - 24.56] on this animal protein diet or this keto
[22.96 - 26.48] animal protein diet if you're like oh
[24.56 - 28.48] i'm doing medical medium on the anal
[26.48 - 31.20] protein i'm keeping it clean whatever
[28.48 - 33.60] i'm keeping it nice and good and no
[31.20 - 35.52] you could be plant-based or vegan
[33.60 - 37.44] and be like well i went medical medium
[35.52 - 38.64] i'm vegan now it's like
[37.44 - 40.72] dude
[38.64 - 41.84] you can go vegan out there in the vegan
[40.72 - 43.44] world
[41.84 - 45.04] and get sick
[43.44 - 47.12] that's what you can do i've watched it
[45.04 - 49.68] for years and years and years for
[47.12 - 53.44] 30 years out there because
[49.68 - 56.48] it's not just medical medium is vegan
[53.44 - 59.04] because vegans nutritional yeast vegans
[56.48 - 63.12] all kinds of stuff vegan is soy sauce
[59.04 - 64.80] with msg vegan is uh high fat vegan is
[63.12 - 68.48] tons of nuts and seeds and nut butters
[64.80 - 70.72] vegan is oils fried in pans vegan is
[68.48 - 72.24] so it's like i went vegan a medical
[70.72 - 74.40] medium that i went vegan it's like what
[72.24 - 76.32] do you mean did you do are you medical
[74.40 - 79.20] medium plant-based are you just
[76.32 - 81.44] plant-based or vegan because you could
[79.20 - 83.04] do that all wrong and not heal you know
[81.44 - 84.24] i went i cleaned up i got rid of
[83.04 - 87.36] processed foods and now i'm animal
[84.24 - 88.56] protein keto animal protein you know
[87.36 - 91.44] keeping it all good but i'm doing
[88.56 - 93.84] medical medium sure but are you doing it
[91.44 - 95.52] right are you doing it wrong
[93.84 - 97.60] how are you doing it how are you doing
[95.52 - 98.72] your animal protein are you still doing
[97.60 - 100.16] eggs
[98.72 - 103.12] because if you still got eggs in your
[100.16 - 104.72] animal protein medical medium diet
[103.12 - 106.16] then we're in trouble if you're still
[104.72 - 108.00] doing cheese and dairy in your medical
[106.16 - 109.12] medium animal protein diet then we're in
[108.00 - 109.92] trouble
[109.12 - 111.28] so
[109.92 - 113.12] that's something to consider right there
[111.28 - 114.64] that's something to understand so we're
[113.12 - 116.80] talking about plant-based
[114.64 - 118.64] versus animal base that's what we're
[116.80 - 121.04] talking about there and you can do them
[118.64 - 123.92] both wrong and not heal there's plenty
[121.04 - 126.96] of sick vegan people out there plenty of
[123.92 - 129.60] sick plant-based people out there plenty
[126.96 - 131.36] in fact where do they go after they get
[129.60 - 132.96] sick they run back to animal protein
[131.36 - 135.52] they start out animal protein early in
[132.96 - 137.52] their life they get sick then they go
[135.52 - 139.60] vegan they get a little bit better they
[137.52 - 142.08] find some vegan doctor they find some
[139.60 - 144.16] vegan doctor online they're doing this
[142.08 - 146.32] and then they get sick again
[144.16 - 147.60] and now they're back on eggs and now
[146.32 - 149.28] they're back on dairy products right you
[147.60 - 150.96] guys have you seen that and then they're
[149.28 - 152.56] back on eggs and dairy and everything
[150.96 - 154.16] else right i just want to give everybody
[152.56 - 156.08] before we go into the plant-based versus
[154.16 - 158.00] animal base which is really an important
[156.08 - 160.32] topic i can't wait to cover it
[158.00 - 161.60] um this pretty much the last day for the
[160.32 - 163.28] sale on the juicer just letting
[161.60 - 164.40] everybody know i figured i'd do that
[163.28 - 166.72] because
[164.40 - 168.64] once the sale is over and then the dms
[166.72 - 170.88] start coming through and then people are
[168.64 - 172.40] commenting where do i get a juicer
[170.88 - 174.00] what's the best juicer and i'm like oh
[172.40 - 175.92] my god you're going to pay full price oh
[174.00 - 178.16] my god you're going to pay full price
[175.92 - 179.84] and which is fine because it's still
[178.16 - 181.92] inexpensive compared to other juicers
[179.84 - 184.88] but the point is is that why not save
[181.92 - 187.12] it's 50 off so
[184.88 - 189.36] why not um and i talked about why this
[187.12 - 191.92] juice is so amazing it saves you so much
[189.36 - 193.60] money that it pays for itself a couple
[191.92 - 195.28] of months the juicer is already paid for
[193.60 - 196.96] so it's like you didn't even buy it
[195.28 - 198.80] basically i call this like a free juicer
[196.96 - 200.40] in a way because it saves you so much
[198.80 - 202.56] money when you're juicing and other
[200.40 - 204.16] juicers don't that it actually pays for
[202.56 - 207.76] itself in just a month or two it's the
[204.16 - 210.32] mm 900 hds it's the last day of the sale
[207.76 - 211.76] okay so megajuicers.com
[210.32 - 214.32] you guys know i'm working with the mega
[211.76 - 216.64] on this juicer because it is one one
[214.32 - 219.04] badass juicer is so amazing
[216.64 - 220.24] and uh it is my favorite and i'll talk
[219.04 - 221.84] about that in a little bit of why it's
[220.24 - 224.00] so incredible and why you save money and
[221.84 - 225.36] why it matters so and you can use
[224.00 - 226.72] anything in this machine but it's the
[225.36 - 228.08] last day i think today's the last day of
[226.72 - 229.84] the sale or tomorrow morning is the last
[228.08 - 231.28] day all i know it's coming to the net
[229.84 - 233.12] it's coming to an end so i'm just
[231.28 - 235.92] letting everybody know but i've already
[233.12 - 237.92] saved thousands in food food costs
[235.92 - 240.08] because the juicer so it's technically
[237.92 - 241.92] bought me like 20 30 juicers or whatever
[240.08 - 244.16] it is yeah whatever it is i don't know
[241.92 - 246.00] how it's so you know it's incredible so
[244.16 - 247.04] back to plant-based versus animal-based
[246.00 - 249.20] right
[247.04 - 251.76] a really important topic hey i'm doing
[249.20 - 253.68] vegan right now you know and and i'm
[251.76 - 254.64] doing medical medium i went vegan it's
[253.68 - 256.56] like
[254.64 - 258.24] what vegan did you do
[256.56 - 260.08] are you online mixing it up are you
[258.24 - 261.52] mixing up with other vegan doctor stuff
[260.08 - 263.92] are you mixing it up with other vegan
[261.52 - 266.00] whatever because chances are you're in
[263.92 - 267.60] trap land and you're stepping in
[266.00 - 268.56] landmines and stepping in traps
[267.60 - 270.00] everywhere
[268.56 - 271.52] you got like i said the nutritional
[270.00 - 273.04] yeast then you got the chocolate well i
[271.52 - 274.72] can do vegan i'm still doing chocolate
[273.04 - 276.32] let me do cacao in there okay blow out
[274.72 - 277.84] your adrenals and when you get sick
[276.32 - 279.60] later
[277.84 - 281.52] that's why you went vegan to begin with
[279.60 - 283.36] because you're sick you went sick when
[281.52 - 284.88] you get sick later
[283.36 - 286.56] you're not going to know that the cacao
[284.88 - 289.84] powder has to go or you ain't going to
[286.56 - 292.08] stand a chance the details matter
[289.84 - 294.32] they so matter you guys this is so
[292.08 - 296.80] important the details so matter in this
[294.32 - 299.44] they really do so
[296.80 - 301.28] hey you know vegan and and you know hey
[299.44 - 303.36] i did medical medium i was vegan it
[301.28 - 305.04] didn't work for me what did you do did
[303.36 - 307.20] you do the customized protocols that you
[305.04 - 309.76] can customize within the books did you
[307.20 - 311.36] do that are you doing are you doing like
[309.76 - 313.12] the nutritional yeast and the caffeine
[311.36 - 314.88] and the apple cider vinegar hey i'm
[313.12 - 316.80] doing i'm doing plant-based and i'm
[314.88 - 318.56] doing medical medium but you're doing
[316.80 - 321.44] apple cider vinegar you're not doing
[318.56 - 323.20] medical medium you're not it's okay if
[321.44 - 325.04] you want to dabble look
[323.20 - 326.72] there are lots of people that dabble and
[325.04 - 328.56] they dabble and with different things
[326.72 - 330.08] and they're using medical medium stuff
[328.56 - 331.84] they're juicing some celery juice or
[330.08 - 333.36] their closet drinking celery juice or
[331.84 - 334.72] whatever they're doing out there or
[333.36 - 336.32] they're doing some other tools that they
[334.72 - 338.56] learned from medical medium like zinc or
[336.32 - 340.88] something else and they're doing things
[338.56 - 342.00] and then they're dabbling though
[340.88 - 343.44] and they're doing their apple cider
[342.00 - 345.84] vinegar because they found out there's
[343.44 - 348.40] some other vegan blah blah that when we
[345.84 - 350.40] do apple cider vinegar this looks good
[348.40 - 352.56] but when they get sick
[350.40 - 355.92] they'll be back over to animal protein
[352.56 - 357.76] like a run they'll run scared and
[355.92 - 359.44] they'll be like i did the vegan thing i
[357.76 - 361.36] tried medical medium they didn't try
[359.44 - 364.40] medical medium they were doing somebody
[361.36 - 366.80] else's vegan stuff and mixing everything
[364.40 - 369.28] up this is so important is one of the
[366.80 - 371.12] big mistakes i see constantly it's like
[369.28 - 372.64] oh wait wait what do i do i go vegan
[371.12 - 373.92] well first of all you can be animal
[372.64 - 375.92] protein
[373.92 - 377.04] and do medical medium
[375.92 - 380.24] you can
[377.04 - 383.68] be animal protein and do medical medium
[380.24 - 385.44] you can be plant-based and vegan and do
[383.68 - 387.52] medical medium
[385.44 - 388.72] but are you doing it right
[387.52 - 390.16] are you doing it in a way that you're
[388.72 - 391.60] gonna heal
[390.16 - 393.84] are you gonna do it so you can heal your
[391.60 - 395.92] eczema don't you want your eczema gone
[393.84 - 398.40] don't you want your psoriasis gone your
[395.92 - 401.28] vitiligo gone your acne gone your
[398.40 - 403.04] dermatitis gone your rosacea gone don't
[401.28 - 404.88] you want your brain fog gone and your
[403.04 - 406.48] anxiety and depression do you want your
[404.88 - 408.04] trigeminal neuralgic on do you want your
[406.48 - 410.32] hashimoto's gone do you want your
[408.04 - 412.72] hyperthyroidism god do you want your ra
[410.32 - 414.48] gone do you want your neurological lime
[412.72 - 417.36] gone for good
[414.48 - 419.36] like your neurological lyme gone
[417.36 - 421.52] like for good
[419.36 - 423.44] then we we just have to get it a little
[421.52 - 424.56] bit right at least we've got to get it
[423.44 - 427.36] right
[424.56 - 431.44] so it's not just about hey i'm vegan and
[427.36 - 434.16] i'm i'm doing anthony williams stuff no
[431.44 - 436.64] are you sure because vegan isn't medical
[434.16 - 440.72] medium and animal protein isn't medical
[436.64 - 443.36] medium unless it's medical medium
[440.72 - 444.56] where you're doing the plant-based
[443.36 - 445.84] diet
[444.56 - 448.24] but you're doing maybe the medical
[445.84 - 450.88] medium mono cleanser doing the 3-6-9
[448.24 - 452.56] right you're doing the heavy metal detox
[450.88 - 455.60] cleanse
[452.56 - 457.36] moderation doesn't work
[455.60 - 459.36] when you're really sick
[457.36 - 461.92] moderation leads to desperation i told
[459.36 - 463.76] you guys it leads to desperation the
[461.92 - 465.20] moderation game takes you to a place
[463.76 - 466.88] where you end up getting in trouble look
[465.20 - 468.32] you don't have to be perfect i'm going
[466.88 - 470.16] to tell you right now
[468.32 - 471.60] this is important to know right you're
[470.16 - 473.20] probably thinking well what now i got to
[471.60 - 474.80] like i got to walk such a straight line
[473.20 - 477.68] with my foods i got to walk such a
[474.80 - 480.64] straight line with everything
[477.68 - 483.36] if you're really chronically ill
[480.64 - 485.84] the details matter and you do have to
[483.36 - 488.00] walk that straight line
[485.84 - 489.20] if you can't get there yet fine but just
[488.00 - 491.52] know that
[489.20 - 493.36] if you can't get there yet just know
[491.52 - 495.60] that though
[493.36 - 497.20] symptoms can be stubborn and if they're
[495.60 - 498.88] stubborn with you
[497.20 - 500.96] and your symptoms are really hanging in
[498.88 - 503.12] there then we got to walk the straight
[500.96 - 504.32] line we have to get there
[503.12 - 506.32] we do
[504.32 - 508.16] if you want to dabble fine but just know
[506.32 - 509.84] that's what you're doing and that's okay
[508.16 - 511.44] i got a friend it's like look i'm
[509.84 - 514.08] dabbling in your stuff and then when i
[511.44 - 516.08] get sick i dabble in your stuff again i
[514.08 - 517.92] do more stuff of your stuff and then
[516.08 - 519.36] when i'm sicker i do more stuff until
[517.92 - 521.12] i'm better and then i go back and forth
[519.36 - 522.96] i'm like why do you do that why don't
[521.12 - 524.72] you just get better completely put it
[522.96 - 527.04] behind you know what to do and like well

[719.28 - 722.48] vegan
[720.56 - 724.96] i don't need to do medical medium isn't
[722.48 - 726.96] he just a vegan guy or something and i'm
[724.96 - 728.88] i got this other vegan situation going
[726.96 - 731.28] over here and then when you're sick
[728.88 - 733.12] you'll be scobbling down those eggs
[731.28 - 734.80] you'll be running
[733.12 - 736.40] for those eggs you know why vegans don't
[734.80 - 738.32] rip down eggs first of all they don't
[736.40 - 740.08] know what they do
[738.32 - 742.48] unless they know mm info they don't know
[740.08 - 744.64] that eggs feed all the viruses inside
[742.48 - 746.64] your body to keep you sick eggs feed all
[744.64 - 748.88] the bacteria and fungus and yeast and
[746.64 - 751.28] mold that's inside your body and keeps
[748.88 - 753.68] you sick so eggs feed
[751.28 - 755.36] all the stuff inside of us
[753.68 - 756.88] that keeps us sick
[755.36 - 758.80] right
[756.88 - 760.40] and i talked about that over and over
[758.80 - 761.76] again you guys know i talked about the
[760.40 - 763.60] books and stuff like that but what
[761.76 - 765.76] happens with vegans and the plant-based
[763.60 - 767.68] people they get sick because they're
[765.76 - 769.84] cranking the high fats they're drowning
[767.68 - 772.00] their gallbladders and liver out they're
[769.84 - 774.56] killing their pancreases with the fats
[772.00 - 776.00] they're told to eat too much fat right
[774.56 - 777.76] and then they're doing that and then
[776.00 - 778.80] they're doing the poisons like the msg
[777.76 - 779.68] and the apple cider vinegar and
[778.80 - 781.60] everything and they're burning
[779.68 - 785.28] themselves out
[781.60 - 787.28] and then their pathogens crank up
[785.28 - 789.84] and when their pathogens crank up
[787.28 - 791.60] they're sick as a vegan
[789.84 - 793.92] and now they're proving the animal
[791.60 - 795.52] protein world right that veganism is
[795.52 - 801.60] you know the animal protein
[797.68 - 804.08] tagline it's like yeah vegans what what
[801.60 - 805.92] a you know all the vegans are sick all
[804.08 - 807.20] the plant-based people are sick
[805.92 - 809.36] meanwhile
[807.20 - 810.56] all the animal protein people are sick
[809.36 - 812.64] two
[810.56 - 813.92] all of them the keto people they get
[812.64 - 815.12] sick sure if you've never been sick
[813.92 - 816.40] before and you're some guy that had a
[815.12 - 817.76] little bit of weight on you and you go
[816.40 - 819.20] into the gym for the first time in your
[817.76 - 820.80] life and you're 35 years old and you
[819.20 - 822.88] start eating keto
[820.80 - 824.24] you're yeah you're gonna start looking a
[822.88 - 826.24] little better and feel a little better
[824.24 - 828.08] because it's it's definitely better than
[826.24 - 830.00] what you were doing but if you get a
[828.08 - 832.24] real problem that keto diet will kill
[830.00 - 832.24] you
[832.32 - 836.16] you can do animal protein but if you do
[834.16 - 838.56] it right and you do a medical medium
[836.16 - 840.64] style you can stand a chance
[838.56 - 842.80] plant same thing with the plant-based
[840.64 - 844.08] stuff right
[842.80 - 846.16] same thing with the plant-based stuff
[844.08 - 847.20] you can do the plant-based stuff totally
[846.16 - 848.48] wrong
[847.20 - 850.24] totally wrong
[848.48 - 853.36] and get yourself sick
[850.24 - 855.04] and then you're sucking down those eggs
[853.36 - 856.96] know why plant-based people don't rip
[855.04 - 858.72] apart eggs because man they love their
[856.96 - 860.96] eggs they went plant-based and it's the
[858.72 - 863.28] one place they feel like if they just
[860.96 - 865.20] get convinced that
[863.28 - 867.60] eggs are still really good for them
[865.20 - 869.68] they'll eat them again right and if they
[867.60 - 871.60] get sick man they're gonna be back
[869.68 - 873.60] they're gonna be back on their eggs if
[871.60 - 876.00] they get sick thumbs up if you like this

[1203.52 - 1206.88] the wrong juicer so make sure you ask
[1205.12 - 1208.96] other people too that know about the
[1206.88 - 1210.88] mm-900 hds
[1208.96 - 1212.96] that's the dry pulp right there it's
[1210.88 - 1215.04] just in my fingers
[1212.96 - 1216.16] okay that's dry
[1215.04 - 1217.60] i'm just showing you the bottom of the
[1216.16 - 1221.20] container on tik-tok you see this you
[1217.60 - 1223.20] guys on telegram you see this
[1221.20 - 1225.68] this is not a camera trick
[1223.20 - 1228.40] that's dry
[1225.68 - 1228.40] that's dry
[1228.56 - 1233.12] can you believe that
[1230.96 - 1235.76] i mean i'm serious
[1233.12 - 1237.60] it blows my mind every time
[1235.76 - 1239.60] that's dry pulp
[1237.60 - 1241.84] everything's squeezed out of it that's a
[1239.60 - 1244.56] dry pulp container
[1241.84 - 1246.40] what i mean when i look at it i'm like
[1244.56 - 1248.88] this is like for real
[1246.40 - 1250.32] like in fact it's so dry it's so dry
[1248.88 - 1252.16] it's actually like
[1250.32 - 1253.76] it's kind of like freaking me out a
[1252.16 - 1255.28] little bit because it doesn't make any
[1253.76 - 1257.12] sense but it does make sense it's
[1255.28 - 1258.80] designed to squeeze basically every last
[1257.12 - 1261.04] drop out of your celery and then you
[1258.80 - 1263.84] save because you now you can buy you
[1261.04 - 1266.48] know you buy less celery and then that's
[1263.84 - 1268.24] 20 you just saved and then it adds up
[1266.48 - 1270.24] and then the juicers paid for and then
[1268.24 - 1271.68] boom like how insane is that it's just
[1270.24 - 1272.80] crazy this is
[1271.68 - 1274.84] crazy
[1272.80 - 1277.68] karen says can the celery juice be
[1274.84 - 1279.84] frozen if not how many days can you
[1277.68 - 1281.60] store it in the fridge look
[1279.84 - 1282.64] 24 hours in the fridge is not the end of
[1281.60 - 1286.32] the world
[1282.64 - 1288.96] sometimes i've gone gone as far as 48
[1286.32 - 1290.72] hours and then consumed it okay so if
[1288.96 - 1292.16] you had to do 48 hours in the fridge and
[1290.72 - 1294.48] consuming it's still better than
[1292.16 - 1295.28] anything else you can get out there
[1294.48 - 1296.56] okay
[1295.28 - 1298.32] if you have to freeze it because you
[1296.56 - 1299.76] need it a week later or something like
[1298.32 - 1302.64] that freeze it
[1299.76 - 1305.20] don't add any water to it don't add any
[1302.64 - 1307.36] any ice to it don't add any lemon to it
[1305.20 - 1308.48] don't add anything to it you guys so
[1307.36 - 1310.48] important
[1308.48 - 1312.24] so important but did you see that i'm
[1310.48 - 1314.80] still actually like
[1312.24 - 1318.48] it's so dry it's coming out like dust
[1314.80 - 1320.80] and the bottom's dry it's just
[1318.48 - 1323.52] the amount you save is ridiculous and
[1320.80 - 1325.12] it's incredible
[1323.52 - 1326.56] and that's that's what's amazing right
[1325.12 - 1327.92] there on its own
[1326.56 - 1330.32] i love it
[1327.92 - 1332.56] it's it's it's it's my favorite you know
[1330.32 - 1334.16] it's so incredible another thing too to
[1332.56 - 1335.36] know that you want to strain it so i'm
[1334.16 - 1337.76] showing everybody right now that you
[1335.36 - 1339.52] want to strain your celery juice so keep
[1337.76 - 1342.72] in mind that you always want to strain
[1339.52 - 1346.16] it this is an herbal extraction like tea
[1342.72 - 1348.40] okay when you have herbal tea you're
[1346.16 - 1350.80] extracting herbal medicine from that tea
[1348.40 - 1351.60] so if you have your chamomile tea just
[1350.80 - 1353.52] say
[1351.60 - 1356.72] or your peppermint tea or if you're
[1353.52 - 1358.96] having your licorice tea chamomile tea
[1356.72 - 1360.32] whatever tea you're having right and
[1358.96 - 1362.32] because a lot of people drink chamomile
[1360.32 - 1363.20] tea that's why i'm using that one and
[1362.32 - 1365.36] you
[1363.20 - 1368.00] do your tea bag your chamomile tea bag
[1365.36 - 1370.72] in there you don't cut open the tea bag
[1368.00 - 1372.72] and get all those you get those gritty
[1370.72 - 1375.28] pieces of
[1372.72 - 1377.44] fiber because the it was extracted you
[1375.28 - 1378.96] did the hot water extraction in your
[1377.44 - 1379.84] herbal tea you see
[1378.96 - 1382.08] so
[1379.84 - 1383.68] that's the same thing this is not a
[1382.08 - 1385.60] vegetable
[1383.68 - 1387.28] so important for you guys to know that
[1385.60 - 1389.36] this is not a vegetable it's not a
[1387.28 - 1391.20] veggie it's not
[1389.36 - 1392.88] and when you hear a dietitian out there
[1391.20 - 1395.36] or hear you if you hear even a
[1392.88 - 1397.52] plant-based so-called expert or a vegan
[1395.36 - 1398.80] expert call it a vegetable it's like
[1397.52 - 1401.12] whoa
[1398.80 - 1403.12] whoa you just don't know you just don't
[1401.12 - 1405.20] know when you hear that
[1403.12 - 1406.80] it's like they don't get it
[1405.20 - 1410.08] that's an herbal extraction this is
[1406.80 - 1413.76] herbal medicine it's partly why it heals
[1410.08 - 1415.28] people to the degree it does it's really
[1413.76 - 1416.80] so healing right
[1415.28 - 1418.96] so
[1416.80 - 1420.56] why is celery juice healing us why is it
[1418.96 - 1422.24] healing millions of people around the
[1420.56 - 1424.88] world
[1422.24 - 1426.96] why is it doing that dr fine good to see
[1424.88 - 1430.56] you incredible
[1426.96 - 1432.64] do you eat the shells of the nuts
[1430.56 - 1434.16] that's really funny if you're sensitive
[1432.64 - 1435.52] because you got a lot of pathogens and
[1434.16 - 1437.52] you don't know it like you got the h
[1435.52 - 1439.60] pylori in your gut and you got the e
[1437.52 - 1441.28] coli and the c diff and you got the
[1439.60 - 1442.80] streptococcus and you don't know this
[1441.28 - 1445.28] but you're filled with yeast mold
[1442.80 - 1446.72] unproductive fungus and pathogens and
[1445.28 - 1448.72] everything inside your body and your
[1446.72 - 1450.88] liver inside your intestinal tract and
[1448.72 - 1452.80] you do celery juice
[1450.88 - 1454.24] you might be a little sensitive so you
[1452.80 - 1455.52] start with a smaller amount when you
[1454.24 - 1457.84] first start you don't have to throw out
[1455.52 - 1460.08] 16 to 32 ounces you can start with four
[1457.84 - 1462.24] ounces and build yourself up start with
[1460.08 - 1464.48] eight ounces right maybe you can go into
[1462.24 - 1466.08] it right away at 16 ounces
[1464.48 - 1468.24] and you can do that
[1466.08 - 1470.40] celery juice is a complete electrolyte
[1468.24 - 1472.00] that's why it holds power you guys so
[1470.40 - 1473.84] let's cover that for a second this is
[1472.00 - 1475.60] important right
[1473.84 - 1477.52] this is really important
[1475.60 - 1479.60] your brain
[1477.52 - 1481.92] needs electrolytes
[1479.60 - 1483.92] critical
[1481.92 - 1486.72] trace mineral salts and electrolytes but
[1483.92 - 1489.28] it doesn't need salt
[1486.72 - 1492.88] like salt you're throwing on like sea
[1489.28 - 1496.24] salt on your food or rock salt or
[1492.88 - 1497.84] it doesn't need some that kind of salt
[1496.24 - 1500.40] it needs
[1497.84 - 1502.64] trace minerals
[1500.40 - 1504.80] that are attached to the sodium in
[1502.64 - 1506.32] celery it's an entirely different salt
[1504.80 - 1508.48] it's not the same
[1506.32 - 1510.88] it's not the same as sea salt or the
[1508.48 - 1513.12] same as as like a rock salt or anything
[1510.88 - 1515.20] okay this is packed with trace minerals
[1513.12 - 1517.20] sodium cluster salt so that's basically
[1515.20 - 1519.28] you've got a little solar system with
[1517.20 - 1521.04] trace minerals around it
[1519.28 - 1523.04] inside of here
[1521.04 - 1525.52] and it goes to the brain and it
[1523.04 - 1527.84] recharges your neurotransmitters
[1525.52 - 1529.44] and your neurons your neurotransmitters
[1527.84 - 1531.20] and neurons is really important to know
[1529.44 - 1532.80] it's a complete electrolyte so let's
[1531.20 - 1534.40] cover that for a second every time you
[1532.80 - 1536.32] eat check this out
[1534.40 - 1538.88] if you guys got a second
[1536.32 - 1540.72] i know you're busy
[1538.88 - 1543.44] if you eat something
[1540.72 - 1546.40] you're trying to collect an electrolyte
[1543.44 - 1549.92] from it parts of electrolytes so when
[1546.40 - 1552.40] you have a banana or you have a nut or
[1549.92 - 1554.96] you have avocado or you have a little
[1552.40 - 1556.96] piece of chicken whatever you eat
[1554.96 - 1558.88] what you're doing is you're trying to
[1556.96 - 1560.88] collect electrolytes from everything
[1558.88 - 1562.24] you're eating did you guys know that
[1560.88 - 1563.92] you're trying to collect electrolytes
[1562.24 - 1565.68] from everything you're eating
[1563.92 - 1567.84] but guess what dr sherry green good to
[1565.68 - 1569.68] see you they're not complete
[1567.84 - 1573.04] electrolytes
[1569.68 - 1574.88] it's not complete you're trying to
[1573.04 - 1576.48] piecemeal your electrolytes with
[1574.88 - 1578.80] everything you're eating so when you
[1576.48 - 1581.12] have your salad you're trying to piece
[1578.80 - 1582.88] together electrolytes when you have your
[1581.12 - 1585.04] animal protein you're trying to piece
[1582.88 - 1586.40] together some if you're plant-based and
[1585.04 - 1588.48] you're having your nut butter as an
[1586.40 - 1590.72] avocado you're trying to piece together
[1588.48 - 1592.64] electrolytes
[1590.72 - 1594.72] but guess what
[1592.64 - 1597.28] why is celery juice reversing disease
[1594.72 - 1598.80] healing people changing their lives
[1597.28 - 1600.56] turning their lives around like no
[1598.80 - 1602.80] tomorrow
[1600.56 - 1604.56] one of the reasons is it's a complete
[1602.80 - 1606.08] electrolyte there's nothing else on the
[1604.56 - 1607.92] planet that's a complete electrolyte
[1606.08 - 1610.64] news flash
[1607.92 - 1612.64] there's nothing else on the planet
[1610.64 - 1614.40] that's a complete
[1612.64 - 1617.20] electrolyte
[1614.40 - 1621.04] and that's what's incredible about that
[1617.20 - 1622.32] it's just one big huge reason
[1621.04 - 1624.40] all right
[1622.32 - 1626.56] if you guys just got on i was telling
[1624.40 - 1629.28] everybody that's 50 off it's like the
[1626.56 - 1632.72] sales ending it's ending soon i just i
[1629.28 - 1634.88] just blew my mind again by talking about
[1632.72 - 1635.84] the pulp and how dry the container is
[1634.88 - 1638.72] right
[1635.84 - 1640.32] celery juice kills pathogens viruses and
[1638.72 - 1643.20] bacteria
[1640.32 - 1645.92] all the bad stuff inside of us it starts
[1643.20 - 1646.88] to kill it so as you drink your celery
[1645.92 - 1649.20] juice
[1646.88 - 1652.00] it's starting to kill
[1649.20 - 1653.84] those bugs inside of us so everybody's
[1652.00 - 1655.60] running around you've got hashimoto's
[1653.84 - 1658.00] well guess what you've got epsine bar in
[1655.60 - 1660.32] your thyroid you got eczema psoriasis
[1658.00 - 1663.04] you got epsin bar in your liver okay you
[1660.32 - 1666.08] got acne you got streptococcus in your
[1663.04 - 1670.00] lymphatic system and your liver and
[1666.08 - 1671.92] other places see that's how it works
[1670.00 - 1673.92] so these little bugs are why everybody's
[1671.92 - 1675.92] sick you've got neurological lime you've
[1673.92 - 1678.24] got both strep and you've got lots of
[1675.92 - 1680.56] bugs like shingles
[1678.24 - 1682.64] epstein-barr
[1680.56 - 1685.12] you get fever blisters any of you guys
[1682.64 - 1685.92] could ever get a fever blister simplex
[1685.12 - 1688.64] one
[1685.92 - 1690.80] that simplex not friendly likes to hide
[1688.64 - 1692.56] all in the nerves the trigeminal nerves
[1690.80 - 1694.84] loves to hide in there
[1692.56 - 1697.04] loves to hide in the brain stem
[1694.84 - 1699.28] sometimes and then it creates all these
[1697.04 - 1702.16] migraines in people creates all these
[1699.28 - 1704.72] other things trigeminal neuralgia you're
[1702.16 - 1705.92] hurting here well guess what celery
[1704.72 - 1707.52] juice
[1705.92 - 1710.08] kills off
[1707.52 - 1712.24] that simplex which is your trigeminal
[1710.08 - 1715.20] neuralgia think about that how
[1712.24 - 1717.68] incredible is that you guys
[1715.20 - 1720.40] it's one of the medical medium tools but
[1717.68 - 1723.36] it's a great start
[1720.40 - 1725.44] and it's a great finish
[1723.36 - 1727.84] that's incredible talk a little bit
[1725.44 - 1730.00] about the uh plant-based
[1727.84 - 1730.80] animal protein thing
[1730.00 - 1732.16] okay
[1730.80 - 1733.92] so the animal protein people are
[1732.16 - 1735.36] infamous for ripping apart plant-based
[1733.92 - 1737.76] diet people
[1735.36 - 1739.92] back in the older day you guys it was so
[1737.76 - 1741.92] rough every time spirit of compassion
[1739.92 - 1745.04] wanted to get somebody on the plant base
[1741.92 - 1746.72] right the proper plant-based foods so
[1745.04 - 1749.04] they can heal
[1746.72 - 1752.32] they'd be up against the whole thing of
[1749.04 - 1754.08] like angry family members angry doctors
[1752.32 - 1757.04] saying you're starving yourself eating
[1754.08 - 1760.88] fruits and herbs and wild foods and
[1757.04 - 1763.36] vegetables and leafy greens and it was
[1760.88 - 1765.52] never easy for the plant-based you know
[1763.36 - 1767.28] someone going plant-based right now it's
[1765.52 - 1769.84] more accepted the whole bit but still
[1767.28 - 1772.16] the animal protein movement still says
[1769.84 - 1774.08] some of the same talking points
[1772.16 - 1775.84] you're eating rabbit food you're
[1774.08 - 1777.52] starving your children
[1775.84 - 1779.60] you're hurting your children by not
[1777.52 - 1781.68] giving them enough protein you're
[1779.60 - 1783.20] protein deficient yourself like they say
[1781.68 - 1784.96] all kinds of terrible talking points
[1783.20 - 1786.72] right and then the plant-based vegan
[1784.96 - 1788.32] people you know attack the protein
[1786.72 - 1790.08] people and the animal protein people and
[1788.32 - 1792.64] say you're killing animals
[1790.08 - 1795.44] you're heartless you're cruel
[1792.64 - 1797.36] right and so they're two diet belief
[1795.44 - 1799.76] systems
[1797.36 - 1801.68] medical medium information this is so
[1799.76 - 1804.32] important details matter
[1801.68 - 1807.60] okay is about why you're sick it's not
[1804.32 - 1808.80] about picking a side of a diet belief
[1807.60 - 1811.52] system
[1808.80 - 1813.28] if you pick a side of a diet belief
[1811.52 - 1814.80] system
[1813.28 - 1818.48] you just
[1814.80 - 1822.16] screwed a whole bunch of people
[1818.48 - 1824.24] where they won't heal
[1822.16 - 1826.80] doctors do it all the time
[1824.24 - 1829.68] you screw over a whole bunch of people
[1826.80 - 1831.12] and they don't heal if you pick a diet
[1829.68 - 1833.60] belief system
[1831.12 - 1835.60] practitioners and nutritionists
[1833.60 - 1838.32] totally do it all the time
[1835.60 - 1840.96] once you pick one side
[1838.32 - 1843.04] you're not you're gonna not get a lot of
[1840.96 - 1846.56] people better
[1843.04 - 1848.80] that's how it works if you go one side
[1846.56 - 1850.32] it's not good now you can be on one side
[1848.80 - 1851.92] you can be plant-based and you stay
[1850.32 - 1854.24] plant-based you can be animal protein
[1851.92 - 1856.16] stay animal protein if you want
[1854.24 - 1857.68] i always tell plant-based people stay
[1856.16 - 1860.40] plant-based if you're plant-based you
[1857.68 - 1862.32] better believe it stay plant-based
[1860.40 - 1864.48] learn how to do it right so you don't
[1862.32 - 1866.72] get in trouble and if you're animal
[1864.48 - 1868.00] protein stay animal protein but learn
[1866.72 - 1871.44] how to do it right so you did get in
[1868.00 - 1873.76] trouble mm info was never on one side of
[1871.44 - 1876.96] the aisle or another
[1873.76 - 1878.72] and that's why so many people got their
[1876.96 - 1880.72] lives back because they brought in
[1878.72 - 1882.72] medical medium tools while they were
[1880.72 - 1884.56] animal protein they were doing it right
[1882.72 - 1886.08] while they were plant-based and doing it
[1884.56 - 1887.60] right and they brought in the medical
[1886.08 - 1891.44] medium tools
[1887.60 - 1891.44] you guys hear that on tick-tock telegram
[1891.60 - 1897.28] it's the only healing community
[1895.04 - 1899.92] that doesn't pick sides we got animal
[1897.28 - 1901.20] protein people here and we got plant
[1899.92 - 1904.16] people here
[1901.20 - 1906.32] that's right and always did
[1904.16 - 1909.60] the other communities
[1906.32 - 1912.08] it's like political or something it's
[1909.60 - 1914.64] either your plant-based
[1912.08 - 1916.96] or it's the animal protein community the
[1914.64 - 1918.84] keto community animal keto and then the
[1916.96 - 1921.52] plant-based keto
[1918.84 - 1923.20] right just just plant-based diet eating
[1921.52 - 1924.80] tons of fats
[1923.20 - 1927.04] people just do it no matter what you
[1924.80 - 1928.96] don't have to name keto or not
[1927.04 - 1930.72] they're just doing it
[1928.96 - 1932.64] and on that note of keto anyway on a
[1930.72 - 1935.76] separate note if you guys want a detail
[1932.64 - 1936.72] that matters no one's keto
[1935.76 - 1938.80] because
[1936.72 - 1941.52] the minute they went off the carnival
[1938.80 - 1943.44] keto was just the carnivore diet back
[1941.52 - 1945.36] years ago decades ago
[1943.44 - 1947.28] because the only way to go into ketosis
[1945.36 - 1949.20] is just be on meat only
[1947.28 - 1951.12] no one's on meat only unless they do the
[1949.20 - 1952.48] carnivore diet the carnivore diet should
[1951.12 - 1954.40] get a new name it should be called the
[1952.48 - 1956.48] keto diet unless the carnivore diet
[1954.40 - 1957.92] throws in sugar which they did now and
[1956.48 - 1959.44] they've thrown in honey so they're not
[1957.92 - 1962.40] keto either
[1959.44 - 1964.00] they used to be keto but nobody's keto
[1962.40 - 1965.20] it's another way you know something's
[1964.00 - 1967.52] wrong with the system when they can't
[1965.20 - 1969.28] even get their facts right
[1967.52 - 1970.48] so when you're doing keto you're totally
[1969.28 - 1972.08] like screwed over in the whole of the
[1970.48 - 1973.36] whole thing and i'll say it i say that a
[1972.08 - 1974.72] lot because when you're duped and
[1973.36 - 1977.04] tricked
[1974.72 - 1978.80] and the walls pulled over your eyes
[1977.04 - 1981.84] right
[1978.80 - 1984.08] and you've been bamboozled
[1981.84 - 1986.00] that's what it is
[1984.08 - 1988.16] and basically been through though dupe
[1986.00 - 1991.12] shrimp bamboozle
[1988.16 - 1993.12] all of that will pull over your eyes
[1991.12 - 1994.88] that's what that is
[1993.12 - 1996.80] so here you are thinking you're keto but
[1994.88 - 1999.12] you're not you can't go into ketosis
[1996.80 - 2000.80] because avocado has sugar in it
[1999.12 - 2002.48] avocado was never in the keto diet the
[2000.80 - 2004.48] keto diet killed people because there
[2002.48 - 2006.48] was no sugar in it
[2004.48 - 2008.48] the keto diet killed people back in the
[2006.48 - 2010.88] day did you guys know that
[2008.48 - 2013.52] they died when they
[2010.88 - 2016.40] actually only did it they did it like
[2013.52 - 2018.88] where it's ketosis where you only do
[2016.40 - 2020.96] little pieces of meat all day
[2018.88 - 2022.64] six months eight months later a year
[2020.96 - 2024.16] later they would go into some kind of
[2022.64 - 2025.60] kidney failure
[2024.16 - 2027.92] and die
[2025.60 - 2030.00] but see keto diet lets in berries now
[2027.92 - 2032.00] when they lay in avocados there's sugar
[2030.00 - 2034.48] in those so you can't go into ketosis
[2032.00 - 2037.20] get it right people not you guys the
[2034.48 - 2038.64] keto people the so-called experts nuts
[2037.20 - 2040.88] have sugar in them that's why they're
[2038.64 - 2043.20] sweet so many nuts are sweet
[2040.88 - 2046.96] cheese has sugar in it so what they did
[2043.20 - 2049.28] was they let cheese and nuts and avocado
[2046.96 - 2052.40] and green juices that have sugar in them
[2049.28 - 2054.56] they're letting all these sugar
[2052.40 - 2056.08] like avenues in
[2054.56 - 2058.00] all these foods that have sugar in them
[2056.08 - 2061.92] so it's not keto
[2058.00 - 2063.52] like how can you plan on healing
[2061.92 - 2064.96] when they don't even have it right know
[2063.52 - 2066.00] what they're even talking about now
[2064.96 - 2067.52] you're somebody who might be like well i
[2066.00 - 2070.08] got better on keto okay fine but when
[2067.52 - 2072.88] you get real sick
[2070.08 - 2075.68] you'll see where up you've got duped
[2072.88 - 2077.76] that's how it's done out there
[2075.68 - 2080.16] and you can dabble in medical medium
[2077.76 - 2082.16] totally cool i want you to do that if
[2080.16 - 2085.20] you want to do that i want you to know
[2082.16 - 2087.28] you can go in and out of mm but call it
[2085.20 - 2090.24] like it is
[2087.28 - 2091.84] i'm dabbling in mm
[2090.24 - 2093.92] i'm plant-based but i'm not medical
[2091.84 - 2095.36] medium plant-based i'm animal protein
[2093.92 - 2097.68] but i'm not medical medium animal
[2095.36 - 2100.32] protein i'm dabbling you know call it
[2097.68 - 2102.00] like it is it's okay it's all right
[2100.32 - 2103.60] don't say i did medical medium for three
[2102.00 - 2105.76] years but you didn't because you did all
[2103.60 - 2107.12] this acv and all this kombucha tea and
[2105.76 - 2109.44] all this nutritional yeast and all this
[2107.12 - 2111.20] vegan cheese and all this corn
[2109.44 - 2112.32] and then just and all this caffeine and
[2111.20 - 2113.60] all this chocolate and then you said
[2112.32 - 2114.80] you've been doing medical medium for
[2113.60 - 2116.16] three years and then you write a post
[2114.80 - 2119.20] saying i did medical medium for three
[2116.16 - 2120.00] years and i'm still not better
[2119.20 - 2123.36] and
[2120.00 - 2123.36] all that does is hurt people
[2124.24 - 2127.44] me i'll be fine
[2125.84 - 2128.56] but guess what somebody on mattress
[2127.44 - 2130.40] island
[2128.56 - 2132.24] just got tricked
[2130.40 - 2133.68] because that person wasn't doing mm but
[2132.24 - 2135.36] the person on mattress island that came
[2133.68 - 2137.84] across medical medium that needs a way
[2135.36 - 2140.16] out because she's been on with mattress
[2137.84 - 2141.76] island suffering she's 24 years old or
[2140.16 - 2143.68] 28 years old and
[2141.76 - 2145.44] can't get a start in her life or his
[2143.68 - 2147.52] life and they're on mattress island or
[2145.44 - 2149.28] on couch island and they read somewhere
[2147.52 - 2150.80] someone said i did medical medium for
[2149.28 - 2154.16] three years and i didn't get better yeah
[2150.80 - 2154.16] i'd love to be a fly on the wall
[2154.32 - 2158.08] and that's the whole thing
[2156.16 - 2159.60] it's important to know love to be a fly
[2158.08 - 2162.88] on the wall
[2159.60 - 2164.64] using celery juice is one of medical
[2162.88 - 2166.56] medium tools
[2164.64 - 2170.08] it's one of them and it's an incredible
[2166.56 - 2172.08] place to start it's one powerful tool
[2170.08 - 2174.08] and if you're dabbling it's fine if you
[2172.08 - 2175.20] just do celery juice i said this for
[2174.08 - 2178.08] years
[2175.20 - 2178.88] if you can just do celery juice
[2178.08 - 2180.72] that
[2178.88 - 2183.04] that would be great
[2180.72 - 2184.80] if you can just do the heavy metal detox
[2183.04 - 2187.12] smoothie that would be great if you
[2184.80 - 2189.44] could just get rid of the gluten
[2187.12 - 2191.12] and the dairy that would be great if you
[2189.44 - 2193.60] can get rid of the eggs that would be
[2191.12 - 2197.68] great just if it's one step at a time
[2193.60 - 2199.04] i'm there with you guys on that i am
[2197.68 - 2201.44] but keep it straight when someone's
[2199.04 - 2203.20] talking about medical medium
[2201.44 - 2205.04] like yeah i dabbled
[2203.20 - 2206.64] i dabbled maybe i could have done a
[2205.04 - 2208.48] little bit more maybe i didn't read his
[2206.64 - 2211.04] books thoroughly you know i get it his
[2208.48 - 2212.88] books are medical textbooks
[2211.04 - 2214.32] it's a legendary book at this point now
[2212.88 - 2216.24] millions of copies have been around the
[2214.32 - 2217.52] world because people healed there's no
[2216.24 - 2219.68] marketing
[2217.52 - 2223.04] campaign for it there's no marketing
[2219.68 - 2223.84] companies i don't have a publicist
[2223.04 - 2225.52] okay
[2223.84 - 2228.16] i don't have like
[2225.52 - 2230.48] all that i don't have an agent i don't
[2228.16 - 2231.84] do that kind of stuff i believe in just
[2230.48 - 2233.36] organic
[2231.84 - 2236.00] people healing and telling another
[2233.36 - 2237.44] person that's what i believe in
[2236.00 - 2239.20] and it's
[2237.44 - 2241.12] the best-selling book in the world
[2239.20 - 2243.20] basically in health
[2241.12 - 2244.72] and that's what's incredible and it's
[2243.20 - 2248.48] because people are getting their lives
[2244.72 - 2251.20] back read the book when you get a chance
[2248.48 - 2253.12] the torah says what if what if all we
[2251.20 - 2254.96] can get is conventional celery
[2253.12 - 2256.96] non-organic then get it get conventional
[2254.96 - 2259.28] celery get it
[2256.96 - 2261.76] that's not a bad thing get it wash it
[2259.28 - 2264.00] and wash out the stalks okay
[2261.76 - 2266.08] take your fingers and get that water
[2264.00 - 2268.80] going put a little tiny bit of natural
[2266.08 - 2270.88] dish soap and soap up the water soap up
[2268.80 - 2272.48] the bowl i would get my bowl out right
[2270.88 - 2274.08] now and show you but my balls filled
[2272.48 - 2276.56] with all kinds of stuff you guys i was
[2274.08 - 2277.92] making a whole bunch of stuff earlier
[2276.56 - 2280.80] but
[2277.92 - 2282.64] just and then clean clean
[2280.80 - 2285.36] out this with your fingers and get it
[2282.64 - 2287.68] good yeah there's going to be residue
[2285.36 - 2289.60] but guess what meaning inside the cellar
[2287.68 - 2292.72] but guess what there's pesticide residue
[2289.60 - 2294.80] in every single conventional
[2292.72 - 2296.32] produce and here's the funny thing
[2294.80 - 2298.40] there's there's
[2296.32 - 2299.92] there's conventional
[2298.40 - 2302.96] pesticide
[2299.92 - 2305.60] residue in every single organic
[2302.96 - 2308.56] fruit and vegetable
[2305.60 - 2310.00] because all the organic fields were once
[2308.56 - 2312.40] conventional
[2310.00 - 2315.12] and then seven years past five years
[2312.40 - 2317.44] passed they started the farm they got
[2315.12 - 2321.52] the okay to be organic
[2317.44 - 2323.36] and the earth is loaded with pesticides
[2321.52 - 2326.48] it's okay
[2323.36 - 2328.80] because the celery juice outweighs that
[2326.48 - 2330.72] the celery juice will drive out and
[2328.80 - 2332.64] neutralize more pesticide out of your
[2330.72 - 2335.76] body and pull it out of your body even
[2332.64 - 2337.84] when it's conventional celery juice
[2335.76 - 2339.28] don't do hpp high pressure
[2337.84 - 2341.76] pasteurization i'm going to give you a
[2339.28 - 2343.36] really powerful tip right here do not
[2341.76 - 2344.80] buy
[2343.36 - 2346.96] celery juice in the bottle at the
[2344.80 - 2349.20] grocery store health food store
[2346.96 - 2350.96] that says it's fresh and raw but it
[2349.20 - 2352.72] wasn't freshly made
[2350.96 - 2356.00] it's got a date on it that lasts for
[2352.72 - 2357.92] quite a while because it's hpp
[2356.00 - 2359.84] total
[2357.92 - 2362.48] high pressure pasteurization destroys
[2359.84 - 2364.32] the celery juice
[2362.48 - 2365.92] so you're just getting ripped off
[2364.32 - 2367.52] i want mentioned earlier don't add
[2365.92 - 2370.24] anything to your celery juice no ice no
[2367.52 - 2371.52] lemon no water no no anything else drink
[2370.24 - 2373.76] it straight
[2371.52 - 2375.76] drink it straight
[2373.76 - 2377.76] you know many people i've seen on vegan
[2375.76 - 2378.80] diets have come to me for help even like
[2377.76 - 2380.80] you know
[2378.80 - 2382.40] high profile people celebrities whatever
[2380.80 - 2383.92] throughout the years
[2382.40 - 2385.68] they're like they heard about vegans so
[2383.92 - 2387.52] hey let me go do vegan
[2385.68 - 2389.60] and they're still sick with something
[2387.52 - 2391.36] and then i said well what about celery
[2389.60 - 2394.00] juice oh no i haven't heard of that okay
[2391.36 - 2395.36] let's get you on celery juice 32 ounces
[2394.00 - 2396.96] every single morning and it was like
[2395.36 - 2399.52] miracles happening
[2396.96 - 2401.04] miracles happening even with bad vegan
[2399.52 - 2402.96] and bad plant-based diets i say bad
[2401.04 - 2406.08] because they're riddled in high fat
[2402.96 - 2410.08] apple cider vinegar vinegars in general
[2406.08 - 2411.20] they're soy cheese vegan cheeses canola
[2410.08 - 2414.40] oil
[2411.20 - 2417.44] corn vegan restaurant crap all of it you
[2414.40 - 2419.20] guys vegan cookies everything i get it
[2417.44 - 2421.12] i know everybody wants to have a field
[2419.20 - 2422.08] day they want to have fun all of that
[2421.12 - 2423.68] stuff
[2422.08 - 2424.80] they do
[2423.68 - 2426.48] but
[2424.80 - 2428.56] the vegan diet the plant-based diet
[2426.48 - 2430.40] doesn't mean we're doing it right and
[2428.56 - 2432.72] we're gonna get better or we're not
[2430.40 - 2434.72] gonna get sick it doesn't mean that
[2432.72 - 2435.60] and the animal protein diet is the same
[2434.72 - 2437.36] way
[2435.60 - 2439.68] same way
[2437.36 - 2441.28] okay we're up against so many problems
[2439.68 - 2442.64] with their health more than ever before
[2441.28 - 2444.56] in our history
[2442.64 - 2445.68] mosquito sprays being dumped on us right
[2444.56 - 2448.48] now

[2448.48 - 2451.84] night dump it all night every everywhere
[2450.80 - 2454.56] that's what happens they don't even
[2451.84 - 2455.68] forewarn people they don't tell anybody
[2454.56 - 2457.68] and
[2455.68 - 2459.68] chemtrails coming out of the sky right
[2457.68 - 2461.44] toxic heavy metal exposure all the time
[2459.68 - 2464.40] right old pharmaceuticals and our system
[2461.44 - 2465.52] all this stuff we're up against so much
[2464.40 - 2467.92] and
[2465.52 - 2471.76] so much stress too when you add it all
[2467.92 - 2473.68] up we need some serious fighting tools
[2471.76 - 2475.60] and i i'm not kidding about the medical
[2473.68 - 2478.16] device thing where i don't want to be in
[2475.60 - 2478.16] the hospital
