1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240
everybody gets sick hospitals are filled

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,160
with sick people do you think you're

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
going to go through an entire life not

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,200
getting

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,400
sick no one's done it no one's done it

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,799
before out there do you think you're

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,640
going to go through an entire life and

8
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,439
not get sick I love this even people who

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,880
have survived right they've survived

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,400
through surgeries and different

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,439
sicknesses and all that and they get to

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,880
their 80s and they've survived with

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,640
gallbladders being removed and all kind

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,439
you know pieces of their lungs removed

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,160
right and all of that and they actually

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
get through to the point where they're

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,040
in their 80s and they made it that far

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
and they're in the late ' 80s and all of

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,800
a sudden they die and that happens it's

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,600
horrible they die and then they say well

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,160
they died of natural causes because

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,239
they're older so they say it's natural

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,960
causes meanwhile it's pathogens they

24
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,440
just got to them later somehow it's

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,680
viruses it's bacteria that got to them

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,480
later somehow it's toxic heavy metals

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,120
it's all the junk that's in everybody's

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,799
systems it got to them later right

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,799
pathogens if you ever walk by any place

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,119
like if you're walking down a street and

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,960
if there's a medical center or or a do

32
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,520
or a doctor's office or if you ever

33
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,200
drive by a doctor's office if you ever

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,439
drive by a

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,960
hospital what is going on is broken

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,479
immune system broken immune system

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,040
broken immune system every time I drive

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,600
by a hospital I'm like broken immune

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,600
system every single person in there

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
they're in there because they have a

41
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,159
broken immune system they got a busted

42
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,920
up immune system it's not function

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,799
properly you drive by a doctor's office

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
broken immune system you drive by a skin

45
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,960
doctor's office right broken immune

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,479
system you got a whole bunch of people

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,560
waiting in in the waiting room at a

48
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,600
dermatologist office or a skin skin

49
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,040
surgeon's office broken immune system

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
broken immune system whole bunch of

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,799
people getting different tests in a

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,520
facility a medical facility broken

53
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
immune system that's how it works and

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
yeah another thing too back to what I

55
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
was saying in older people they die of

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,880
pneumonia they die they get sick easy

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
they still get sick easy too everybody

58
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,680
young people old people they get sick

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,200
they get sick at some point in their

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
life and why it's because their immune

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,000
system isn't working good it's because

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,720
the pathogens that we're up against

63
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,959
that's what it is it's a big part now I

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,120
know that many of you be like well it's

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
stress you're not getting enough rest

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
you're not getting enough sleep you're

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,840
too stressed out sure all triggers

68
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,440
definitely you don't sleep that's a

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,440
trigger you don't get enough rest that's

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,200
a trigger you don't get enough you know

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,280
stressfree moments that's right a

72
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,440
trigger all those things are triggers

73
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,840
but triggers for the pathogens to rise

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,200
up and rise up and grow and expand and

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,239
and explode and everything I'm going to

76
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,599
show you guys a little bit about what it

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,640
looks like to have a broken immune

78
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,519
system and I'm going to talk to you guys

79
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,440
about a healthy immune system as well

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,879
what that looks like is is well we're

81
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,319
going to cover a lot of cool stuff

82
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,680
that's what we're here for today and so

83
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,800
anytime you see anybody struggling

84
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,519
whatever it is on the internet right on

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
social you know I got skin problems I

86
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
got this I got that it's because their

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,080
immune system is challenged it's all

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,959
immune system completely underestimated

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
completely underrated out there the

90
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,319
media doesn't talk about the immune

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,959
system it's really rare nowhere do you

92
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,920
really see the immune system talked

93
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,480
about enough meanwhile the reason why

94
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,599
you are sick is because your immune

95
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:29,280
system is not handling what it's up

96
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:31,439
against the reason why everybody is sick

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,519
is because your immune system is

98
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,360
struggling it's weakened it's not

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,200
functioning the way it needs to function

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,920
that is just a fact Jack that's the

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,799
bottom line right there people don't

102
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,920
realize out there that everything UTI

103
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,319
headaches this that you name it right

104
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,640
conjunctivitis body pain ACH a achy body

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,439
fatigue okay all these different things

106
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,480
people are dealing with every single day

107
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,200
bladder

108
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,879
infections everything from PID

109
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,519
everything from cysts and tumors and all

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,959
that immune system you name it warts

111
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,280
immune system there's people out there

112
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,480
they got warts on their hands they got

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,560
warts on their elbows they got warts on

114
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,040
their feet on the bottom of their feet

115
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,359
they got warts in all kinds of different

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
places immune system you catch colds you

117
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,079
catch flu you catch all that all that

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,440
just immune system you can talk about it

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,080
all day everything people are suffering

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
with one way or another it's because

121
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,320
their immune system is broken down you

122
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,720
know somebody with cancer immune system

123
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,240
you know somebody is struggling with any

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
kind of cancer diagnosis any kind of

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
cancer problem and they're struggling

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,600
with that immune system it's just it's

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,800
everything Lyme disease ra fibro thyroid

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,280
problems on any level immune system

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,479
something's wrong something is

130
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,039
struggling within your immune system

131
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,080
it's weakened anything like that does a

132
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,520
matter what it is skin problems all of

133
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,080
it immune system so we're talking about

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,479
the immune system I'm going to do a

135
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,120
little art today I am an

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,840
artist I went to Art School no I didn't

137
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,759
but I have a board here and I'm going to

138
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,520
do a little bit of drawing too I want to

139
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,720
show you guys some immune system stuff

140
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,800
and everything like that but what's

141
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,759
really supposed to happen you're

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,759
supposed to have a strong immune

143
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,280
system immune cell immun

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,400
self eat it all

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,560
up and there you go you got a nice

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,560
healthy immune cell ready for another

147
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,639
one no no immune cell immune

148
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,000
cell gobbling it all up and then you got

149
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,000
a healthy immune cell right there and

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,479
that's what it's supposed to do but it

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,039
doesn't always work like that instead

152
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,720
this is what it's like for a lot of

153
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,639
people right here here's what it is you

154
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,479
ready here it

155
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,479
is I've SE bar flu

156
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,680
RSV whatever

157
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,680
STP

158
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:16,240
here immune cell dead gone and then the

159
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,319
virus is still there the pathogen's

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,240
still there right and then all of a

161
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,280
sudden

162
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,680
again another one immune cell immune

163
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,759
cell coming to rescue immune cell dies

164
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,199
pathogen is still there what the heck is

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,000
going on that's how it work works over

166
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,599
and over again the pathogens stay your

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,639
immune cells die that's why people are

168
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:39,360
sick they're filling in the hospitals

169
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,000
fill in the doctor's office is because

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,880
their immune cells have died sure they

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,280
got some new immune cells being produced

172
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,080
they're coming out but they're weaken

173
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,560
they're

174
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,160
broken and they die fast and they die

175
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,120
easy that's how it works you got a cold

176
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,919
sore you got a fever blister and it's

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,560
sitting there a little too long your

178
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,400
immune cells are dying trying to fight

179
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,879
that so you got the fever

180
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
blister right it's sitting there you got

181
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,960
that fever blister your immune cell

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,000
comes out to get die you just lost

183
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,840
another one and now there it is still

184
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,400
you got the Simplex it's still sitting

185
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,000
there and then you got another immune

186
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
cell coming here coming in there to get

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,039
it boom your immune cell dies what the

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,919
heck is going on your immune cell can't

189
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,120
kill it it can't kill it still there for

190
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,919
another couple days another immune cell

191
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,080
coming out boom dies that's how it works

192
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,479
but people don't talk about that they

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,840
don't know they don't talk about it I

194
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,759
don't see anybody talking about it in

195
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,840
the health realm at all about how many

196
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:43,879
immune cells die and drop dead so fast

197
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,879
and get annihilated by the pathogens by

198
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,960
the viruses and by the

199
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,440
bacteria that's doing it to them and

200
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
people don't talk about it they don't

201
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,960
know you're in the doctor's office you

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,680
got fatigue you got fibromyalgia you got

203
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,840
depression whatever it is you're sick

204
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,360
you don't feel good immune cells are

205
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,440
constantly dying they're trying to fight

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,400
the bad boys your immune cells are

207
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,599
trying to fight the bad boys and they're

208
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,120
getting eaten alive and then the

209
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479
pathogen stays there and the immune cell

210
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,120
is gone and then here it goes again you

211
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,120
got more pathogens now now they're

212
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,960
doubling now they're tripling then you

213
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,159
got more pathogens now you're just sick

214
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,000
for months you got all kinds of things

215
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,000
going on you're catching a cold a flu on

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,680
top of the fact that you got up SE bar

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,520
and then your immune cells come in here

218
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,080
and they get eaten alive again and guess

219
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,080
what stays there you lose lose your

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,200
immune cell and then that's what stays

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,919
there all of this and then we're up

222
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,800
against immune system Busters we're up

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,320
against the fragrances the toxic heavy

224
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,640
metals the toxic waste that we're

225
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,680
dealing with every day the pesticides

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,000
the herbicides everything we deal with

227
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,320
all day long the air fresheners and all

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,560
the other stuff and the detergents the

229
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,320
fabric softeners and all that stuff and

230
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,720
it's just weakening their immune system

231
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,160
even more every single day cologne

232
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,440
weakens the immune system it does so

233
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,320
your immune cells they can't can't

234
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,959
battle all of this so okay someone hey

235
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,240
look you know I've been sick on and off

236
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,079
for 5 years do you know how many immune

237
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,800
cells died in five years I've been sick

238
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,680
for like three years now I got fatigue I

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
got this i got this neurological symptom

240
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,079
I don't feel good I got all kinds of

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,880
issues I've been diagnosed with Ms or

242
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,519
diagnosed with fibro and diagnosed with

243
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,880
chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed with

244
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,399
Lyme disease whatever it is all kinds of

245
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,600
things that I have do you know how many

246
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,839
immune cells died trying to fight those

247
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,720
pathogens

248
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,680
how many of them disappeared and got

249
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,760
annihilated boom gone pathogens just

250
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,560
took over still sick you got a liver

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,560
full of pathogens you got a spleen full

252
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,560
of pathogens you got like a thyroid full

253
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,040
of pathogens that's what people have

254
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,519
they got thyroid problems forever

255
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,920
they're taking thyroid medications they

256
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,800
got the hypothyroidism they got the

257
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
hyperthyroidism they're strugg like the

258
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,440
graves you name it they got the Epstein

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,200
bar sitting inside their thyroid and

260
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,720
guess what you got your immune cells

261
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,560
going there all the time and they're

262
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,800
trying to fight it and they're dying

263
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,839
they're going bye-bye but guess what the

264
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,640
bugs still stay there in the thyroid the

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,560
bugs still stay there in the liver the

266
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,480
bugs still stay there wherever and

267
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,079
that's how it

268
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,600
works

269
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:20,360
sobering really really really

270
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:23,079
sobering is what it is I mean very

271
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:27,360
important does the immune system get

272
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:29,600
smarter if we're eating better well our

273
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,720
immune system doesn't get smarter if

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
we're eating this kind of stuff right

275
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,320
here I'm just going to have a piece of

276
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,079
cheese that'll fix my immune system let

277
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,200
me go and have lots of cheese there's a

278
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,320
here's a a whole a slice of Bree nice

279
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,639
aged Brie right there and we got the

280
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,600
pecarina Romano we got parmesan Rano and

281
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,160
we got all the nice cheeses so great to

282
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,560
put on our dishes our immune system

283
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,600
doesn't get smarter when we're dealing

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,320
with things like this this feeds the

285
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,079
bugs even more I've been talking about

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
that for years when we give our immune

287
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,360
cells though phytochemicals that they

288
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,160
need they get stronger when we feed our

289
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,800
immune cells what they need they get

290
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,240
stronger this does not get your immune

291
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,399
system stronger this right here doesn't

292
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,600
I no people love their eggs the amount

293
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,760
of crap I get because of eggs the amount

294
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,800
of crap there's that's one of the

295
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,320
reasons why there's so many haters

296
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,920
there's so many haters there's so many

297
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
of them for medical medium haters

298
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,200
because they've been so upset about

299
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,800
things like eggs when I talk bad about

300
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:31,240
them or say hey they feed bugs and they

301
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,760
feed pathogens people get upset and then

302
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,240
you then you just birth another hater

303
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,639
born another hater another hater born

304
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,279
another hater born but people don't

305
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,120
realize though this is information to

306
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,360
help them if your immune system is

307
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,320
weakened and you're on eggs it'll stay

308
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,000
weakened because the pathogens will keep

309
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,800
on feeding off the eggs I talked about

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
this this is not an egg show but I'm

311
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,279

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,480
immune

368
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:08,320
cell okay there's an immune cell right

369
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,399
here okay it's supposed to be strong

370
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,079
it's supposed to be vibrant it's

371
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,320
supposed to have what I call Sun

372
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,160
qualities it doesn't mean getting

373
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Sun keeps it strong getting sun is

374
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
healthy setting getting some sun is good

375
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,880
for you yes it's it's supportive for the

376
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,079
immune system definitely but what I like

377
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,480
to say is immune cells I like to call

378
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:32,480
having Sun quality

379
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,160
Sun qualities to them what I mean is a

380
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,360
brightness the immune cell is alive the

381
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,959
immune cell is vital it's strong that's

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,600
how we need to envision our CS that's

383
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:48,880
the cells we want that's the cells we

384
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,120
want to feed and keep strong and keep

385
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,079
stronger and stronger we want our immune

386
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,320
cells like this right here and imagine

387
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,480
your immune cells having blue around

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,360
them imagine your immune cells having

389
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,360
White white light around them and blue

390
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,680
light around them okay so what immune

391
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,560
cell is supposed to admit is energy your

392
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,880
immune cell is supposed to Emmit

393
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:19,240
strength and energy okay that energy is

394
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,639
what weakens the virus or the pathogen

395
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,120
on point keep this in mind all right so

396
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,320
here you go you

397
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,600
got all right I'm going to move this

398
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,440
over a little

399
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,279
bit there we

400
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,360
go your immune cell is supposed to be

401
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,600
emitting strength and energy okay that's

402
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,279
what it's supposed to why not just

403
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,319
because of its vibrancy not just because

404
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,160
of its

405
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:49,319
Vitality that's not just it because the

406
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,000
energy it adits weakens a pathogen when

407
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,160
the pathogen is in a certain radius of

408
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,240
the immune cell a certain

409
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:03,360
radius keep that in mind you got a a

410
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,279
pathogen coming closer to you got a

411
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,279
pathogen coming

412
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,240
closer missing all my little

413
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:17,720
markers so if you got a pathogen

414
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,720
okay and that

415
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,000
pathogen that pathogen is coming near

416
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,800
the immune cell what's radiating off of

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,360
your immune cell is supposed to be so

418
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,519
strong so vital the energy coming off

419
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,920
stuns the pathogen that's what it's

420
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:44,360
supposed to do actually stun it to

421
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,079
weaken it it's kind of like a spell it

422
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,160
puts on the pathogen that's the key we

423
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,480
want our immune cells

424
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,399
strong so that they weaken the pathogen

425
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,240
when the pathogen gets close so as the

426
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,519
pathogen gets closer to the immune

427
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,720
system cell or the immune cell gets

428
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,760
closer to the pathogen the virus the

429
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,880
bacteria and so forth okay this

430
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,360
radiating energy you see coming off of a

431
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,839
strong healthy immune

432
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,559
cell puts the pathogen in a weak in

433
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,240
state like a trance so you see what I'm

434
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:24,280
doing right here when your immune cell

435
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,919
gets closer and closer to that pathogen

436
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,640
it sends out more energy frequency more

437
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,960
vibration

438
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,160
more Vitality emits from your immune

439
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,160
cell as that happens it starts to hit

440
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,360
the pathogen as you see right here on

441
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,840
the board see the

442
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,760
pathogen whether the pathogen is flu

443
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,160
whether the path EBV whether the

444
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,120
pathogen is something else is

445
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,480
strep

446
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:59,960
okay regardless of what it

447
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,799
is that energy emitting from a healthy

448
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,159
vital immune cell an immune cell that

449
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,880
was fed an immune cell that was

450
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,360
supported you guys this is a big deal

451
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,679
not an immune system not an immune cell

452
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,679
that was starved not an immune cell that

453
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,799
was broken down when you got a strong

454
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:24,480
one here's how it's supposed to work

455
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:28,400
it's supposed to disable the pathogen

456
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,960
and prepare it to get eaten it's a

457
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,080
supposed to actually weaken it so if

458
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
there's more pathogens as well say

459
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,880
there's another pathogen here okay

460
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,159
because they explode and they piperade

461
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,840
and they they grow and there's another

462
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,320
pathogen here right here

463
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,240
okay you can have two pathogens three

464
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,960
people get the flu then they get what

465
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,960
happens is you get the flu your immune

466
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,520
system weakens and your immune system

467
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,000
weakens from the flu and then all of a

468
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:01,440
sudden an Epstein bar shows up Epstein

469
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,640
bar are growing as well okay a strong

470
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,159
immune cell radiates a frequency and an

471
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,280
energy has strong vitality and what this

472
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:16,159
is right here what this barrier is

473
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,919
you're seeing okay this barrier is

474
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:22,000
it's a

475
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:24,480
tranquilizer for the pathogen makes it

476
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,600
docile makes it

477
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,600
sleepy makes it

478
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,960
weakened puts it in a trance puts it in

479
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,520
a spell that's your strong immune cell

480
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,120
right there okay as the pathogens weaken

481
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,039
and then they get placed in that

482
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,000
energetic spell you see right here the

483
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:48,320
immune cell can determine what pathogen

484
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,360
it's going to tackle first which one

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,559
it's going to hit right away okay and it

486
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,720
makes a decision because your immune

487
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,520
cells are smart they make a decision

488
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,919
there's your IM cell right there on

489
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,679
which one they're going to attack and

490
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,480
Tackle first to gobble up so this energy

491
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,640
that's admitting that science doesn't

492
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,200
know about that science is unaware of

493
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,520
they don't have their finger on this but

494
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,880
that energy that's admitting putting

495
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:21,799
those pathogens in a trance

496
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,960
okay allows the immune cell to determine

497
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,240
which pathogen which virus what

498
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,440
bacterium it's going to attack first and

499
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,159
Gobble up first because the goal is your

500
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,280
immune cell is trying to stay alive your

501
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,440
immune cell is trying to be strong and

502
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Outlast the

503
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:42,200
bugs your immune cell does not want to

504
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,960
die our immune cells do not get

505
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,640
created in our bones in our body and

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,799
they do not get created because they

507
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,840
want to die fast they want to live long

508
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,559
they want to prosper they want to have

509
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,640
strength and they want to do their job

510
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:58,240
and eat up all the bad

511
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,000
stuff so you got your immune cell right

512
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,080
here that's vital it's got vitality and

513
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,280
strength it's admitting that frequency

514
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,280
it's weakening the Invaders the

515
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,600
pathogens it's making them docile it's

516
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,360
making them sleepy it's making them weak

517
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,720
and then the immune cell makes its break

518
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,440
it determines from admitting that energy

519
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,520
which Invader it's going to attack first

520
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,039
most of the time our immune cells attack

521
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,880
the strongest one the one that's acting

522
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:36,440
out the virus that's acting like a

523
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,039
problem it's not as docile it's not

524
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,799
getting put into a trans easy it's

525
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:46,760
radical it's a radical one

526
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,960
okay and that radical one is the one

527
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,200
that your immune cell goes after that's

528
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
what it does right here it goes after

529
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,159
the radical

530
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,799
one and it leaves the other ones in the

531
00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,720
trance sleepy and Spellbound IND doile

532
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:05,440
and as your immune cell goes It goes to

533
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,480
the radical one and goes into war a

534
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,279
battle that's what it does and in that

535
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,159
battle your immune cell wants to win it

536
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,640
doesn't want to die and a strong immune

537
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:18,159
system stays strong and it wins and it

538
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,600
kills that pathogen right there and it

539
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,440
destroys it and once it destroys it it's

540
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,960
gone right and then it moves on for

541
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,320
another

542
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,480
okay see piley says where does the

543
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,600
immune cell get its incredible

544
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,520
energy we'll talk about that in a little

545
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,799
bit that's a great question and I want

546
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,320
to answer it so what happens now is you

547
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,000
got these other viruses and pathogens

548
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,600
and they're in that sleepy State the

549
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,559
doile state and that's where the immune

550
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,200
cell gains a little bit of strength

551
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,520
again lightens up brightens up gets

552
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,799
strong and then it starts attacking each

553
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,480
one that it knows it actually made spell

554
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:04,799
back bound it attacks each one one at a

555
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,400
time that it knows it made Spell bound

556
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,400
that's how it

557
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:14,559
works

558
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,039
okay but it's not always like this okay

559
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,679
here's what it's like out there you

560
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,120
drive by the hospitals you drive by the

561
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,600
doctor's offices I don't care if you're

562
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,000
10 years old 20 years old 30 years old

563
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,279
the the doctor's offices are filled with

564
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,480
them a lot lots of people young people

565
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:35,279
older people filled with lots and lots

566
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,039
of people they're all struggling with

567
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,679
their immune system because everybody

568
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,120
has immune system problems now here is

569
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
an immune cell right here that's your

570
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,799
immune

571
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:50,520
cell okay this immune cell is a little

572
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,480
weaker

573
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,679
fragmented it's got pits in it pits and

574
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,640
divots in it

575
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,440
okay that's that's what people's immune

576
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
cells look like these days right there

577
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,080
they look like

578
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,919
this a worn out tattered immune cell

579
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,320
that didn't even go through a lot yet

580
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,520
even if it's fresh off the press inside

581
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,960
your body that's the immune cell that

582
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,559
most people are walking around with

583
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,679
every single day it's the weakened

584
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,799
tattered beaten

585
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:30,679
down immune cell it's got divots and

586
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,880
marks in it and pits and

587
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,360
indentations and

588
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,279
inconsistencies and the cell membrane is

589
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,120
weak okay now when it admits strength

590
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,600
and admits Vitality it doesn't admit

591
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,279
what I was showing you before instead

592
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,720
it's kind of feeble it's kind of

593
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:54,120
broken parts of the cell don't even

594
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,840
admit anything only certain parts of the

595
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,360
cell will admit a little bit of strength

596
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,919
and a little bit of frequency okay

597
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,399
and so what happens is though there's

598
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,720
other parts of that cell this is what

599
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,200
people are walking around with every

600
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,360
single day every single day out there

601
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,440
they're struggling with all kinds of

602
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,039
immune system and health issues that's

603
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,919
what they're dealing with their immune

604
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:14,919
cells are tattered broken down don't

605
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,039
look good beaten down they got

606
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,520
indentations inconsistencies all of it

607
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,480
and so even parts of the cell Shadow so

608
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,159
it people don't realize as parts of that

609
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,640
immune system immune cell Will Shadow it

610
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:32,720
won't have have the pop it won't have

611
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:35,480
that strength coming off of it it's

612
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:39,200
fragmented it's weakened and then what

613
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,159
happens is you got the pathogens next

614
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,440
pathogens come around you're getting the

615
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,120
flu you're getting the RSV whatever it

616
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,640
is you got the EBV and you got the

617
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:53,120
pathogens going on here

618
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,120
right put a little fur on the

619
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:00,600
pathogens some bacterium some viruses

620
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,600
don't judge me on my

621
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,679
artistic

622
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,559
talents okay the radiate sorry the

623
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:12,159
energy that's admitting the

624
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:16,080
vibrations that energy field that your

625
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:19,320
immune cell is supposed to have is

626
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,080
weakened it doesn't put these into a

627
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,640
sleep mode there's not enough strength

628
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:29,080
coming off the cell and so what happens

629
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,640
instead is these invad ERS pick up and

630
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,559
they know you have a weaked immune cell

631
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,320
they know it they can smell it a mile

632
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:44,399
away all the different bugs

633
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:49,840
hhv6 cyega virus hsv1 hsv2

634
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:53,440
hhv7 EBV right wrong there

635
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,440
EBV okay

636
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,640
HPV and these invad haers know that the

637
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,159
cells are

638
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,760
broken so much so they don't even have

639
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,399
to be stealth anymore and when those

640
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,039
Invaders don't have to be stealth

641
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:13,080
anymore they rule the roost and you get

642
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,279
the Lyme disease diagnosis and then the

643
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,840
fibro diagnoses and then the ra and then

644
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,880
the sertic arthritis and then the

645
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,399
autoimmune diagnosis and then you get

646
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,120
the neurological symptoms and then you

647
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,799
get all the other different stuff with

648
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:27,240
it and then we live with a host of

649
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,640
different symptoms neurological all

650
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,480
kinds of of other symptoms too because

651
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,799
What's Happening Here is our immune

652
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,080
cells look like that right there

653
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,320
fragmented broken and weakened we can do

654
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,799
something about it this is about

655
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,360
empowering you and doing things for your

656
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,039
immune cells and that's what medical

657
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,440
meum information is all about it's all

658
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,760
about restoring that immune system and

659
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,880
restoring that immune cell and making it

660
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,880
strong and making it vital and

661
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:00,480
vibrant a weakened immune cell has a

662
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,799
problem once it admits its energy it's

663
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,960
already weakening itself it's not

664
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:09,840
staying strong and then it decides what

665
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,480
pathogen it wants to go after and a

666
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,320
weakened immune cell goes after the

667
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,200
weaker pathogen it goes after the one

668
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,919
that seems like the less aggressive and

669
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,960
the one that's the least amount of

670
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:29,960
trouble when it goes after that

671
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:33,360
pathogen like this to eat it up and to

672
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,880
take it out something happens as it's

673
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:41,399
doing it a stronger pathogen will come

674
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,919
and rage war with the weakened

675
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:48,080
cell so then we have a problem on our

676
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:52,240
hands the stronger pathogen will rage

677
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:56,240
War by going to save the other pathogen

678
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:01,720
yes viruses save

679
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,960
viruses but bugs save bugs bugs join

680
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,919
together and gang up on the immune

681
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,600
system bugs join together and gang up on

682
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,799
your organs your glands your thyroid

683
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,279
your liver your pancreas your spleen

684
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:16,559
your intestinal tract your brain your

685
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,120
heart they gang

686
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,000
up they smell

687
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,039
weakness and pathogens can even fight

688
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,799
each other too for the

689
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,679
prize sometimes you'll get a pathogen

690
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,120
that will not just gang up and join

691
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,000
another pathogen but that pathogen will

692
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,159
go and fight another pathogen for the

693
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,720
prize because it wants to take out the

694
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,039
immune cell why because when it eats up

695
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,559
the immune cell it learns information

696
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:48,000
about your immune system it digests and

697
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,240
gobbles up critical secret

698
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,080
information that your immune system

699
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,640
holds and harbors

700
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,840
intelligence and the pathogen gains from

701
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,600
it every time a pathogen wins a war wins

702
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,320
a battle against an immune cell it

703
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,919
gleans information and

704
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,559
Intel and when it does that it

705
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,399
strengthens it for another war and

706
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,720
another battle we walk around with

707
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:16,159
broken immune systems every single day

708
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,279
you see it out there anyone with the

709
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,880
problem you talk to anybody well I got

710
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:23,159
an acne problem broken immune system

711
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,200
well I got you know an ovarian cyst

712
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,640
broken immune system well I got PCOS I

713
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,240
get endometriosis broken immune system

714
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,640
well I got this and this and this and

715
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,159
this and it's endless it's endless and

716
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,720
it's not supposed to be like this it's

717
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,880
not supposed to be like this we're not

718
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,720
supposed to be this sick we're not

719
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,360
supposed to be a country and a world

720
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,480
filled with

721
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,039
sickness Global sickness we're not

722
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,480
supposed to be like

723
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:59,240
that as that immune cell gets destroyed

724
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,240
and eaten up and annihilated by Invaders

725
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
the

726
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,440
Invaders learn information in

727
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,919
Intel that makes it so when the next

728
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,919
immune cell is

729
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,519
born okay the next immune cell is

730
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,880
born there's intelligence inside the

731
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,039
pathogens that they're passing down two

732
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,639
other pathogens about what the

733
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,880
weaknesses were inside that immune cell

734
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:33,320
so that they don't lose the fight with

735
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,440
the new immune cell that's how it works

736
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,279
that's why people stay

737
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,360
sick one of the reasons why they just

738
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,919
stay and stay sick and 20 years of

739
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,399
sickness and 30 years of

740
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:48,679
sickness Chris me perspective haven't

741
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,440
seen you in a while that's why

742
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:52,399
everything you teach is focused on

743
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,279
building the immune system makes so much

744
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,559
sense that's why I'm screaming from the

745
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,200
rooftops about the immune system medical

746
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,639
Med information helps people's adrenals

747
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,200
it restores people that are dealing with

748
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:06,200
Crohn's and Colitis and gut problems it

749
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,480
helps people with acid reflux it helps

750
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,080
people with all kinds of different

751
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,840
conditions and symptoms but I talk about

752
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,840
the immune system for a reason a

753
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,880
reason okay and it's also why when a

754
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:26,200
immune system tools come

755
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,519
out I am freaking out because I'm so

756
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,240
excited okay and maybe you don't maybe

757
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,639
you don't care and you don't care about

758
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,360
your immune system and you don't care

759
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:36,200
about you know a product that has come

760
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,440
out for the immune system and it's not

761
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,360
your thing and that's you don't care but

762
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,720
somebody else might care somebody else

763
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,559
might care and I'm showing you right

764
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,120
here that product right there total

765
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,360
immune is critical I can't even tell you

766
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,760
can't even tell you enough Uma says how

767
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,559
come these bugs have such

768
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,519
intelligence because they were raised by

769
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,440
humans in labs they were all raised by

770
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,960
humans and labs in eggs they cut the top

771
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,240
of the egg off they inseminate the

772
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,320
actual pathogen inside the egg the

773
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,320
pathogen is raised inside the egg and

774
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,679
then they're able to manipulate and use

775
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,639
these pathogens once they come out in

776
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:25,600
experimental ways on animals and even

777
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,760
humans and these pathogens are smart

778
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,159
they gain Intel

779
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,480
intelligence so we got more to talk

780
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:33,399
about with

781
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,240
this okay and pathogens

782
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:38,360
outli people unless you break them out

783
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,000
break them down and beat them down and

784
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,480
kill them they outli people people live

785
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,279
a whole life of sickness because their

786
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,000
immune system is broken and the

787
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:52,320
pathogens are sitting there winning

788
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,880
until finally the person has too many

789
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,919
things going around too many things

790
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,120
going on they got this and they got this

791
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,440
and they got this and they got this this

792
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,480
and they got this and finally they get

793
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,399
older and or younger happens all the

794
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,440
time and they just go and they leave

795
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,560
here pathogens survive over time taking

796
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,240
out more and more people's immune

797
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,359
systems and they learn and adapt and

798
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,679
then we pass that pathogen along to

799
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:20,960
somebody

800
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,839
else cu the pathogen mutated and then we

801
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,079
pass that mutated pathogen on to

802
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,480
somebody else and that's why medical M

803
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,639
talks about so much other stuff

804
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,800
medical medium information talks about

805
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,159
like the toilet seats and you guys know

806
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,159
that intricate information in the

807
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,000
medical medium books right talk about

808
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,599
like relationships and all kinds of

809
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,800
different things how we pass bugs around

810
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,480
and that's okay if we pass bugs around

811
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,839
that's okay but we have to be proactive

812
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,879
we have to know what we're doing we have

813
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,000
to build up our immune system we have to

814
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,720
starve the pathogens of foods that the

815
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,800
pathogens eat we have to

816
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,599
starve those pathogens and I want to I

817
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,880
want to show you some War stuff okay a

818
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,280
new cell is

819
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,560
born every

820
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,760
minute a new cell is born that new cell

821
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,040
along with many other cells born every

822
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,599
single

823
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,440
minute is there but now it's up against

824
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,040
the army of bugs that have a higher

825
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,800
intelligence level and it kind of does

826
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,839
the same thing it admits some strength

827
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,960
out but not a lot because it's a weak

828
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,680
and broken cell it's got It's an immune

829
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,040
cell that's contaminated with toxic

830
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,440
heavy metals air fresheners all kinds of

831
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,079
different fragrances fragrance soaps

832
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,480
this and this all these different

833
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,560
chemicals you name it right it's a cell

834
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,359
that's already hindered already beaten

835
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,200
down and so it's emitting only so much

836
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,599
energy sometimes it'll just be like this

837
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,000
but not here and here so you'll have

838
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,800
energy coming down energy going up but

839
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,400
you don't have energy going here or

840
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,880
here all the different pathogens are

841
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,000
wise ER they're a day wiser they're an

842
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,800
immune cell smarter and so it comes down

843
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,440
to this again the immune cell goes

844
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:11,119
seeking out the pathogens or runs into

845
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,400
the pathogens it emits a tranquil lizer

846
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:18,440
a Spellbound

847
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,440
energy okay it emits the

848
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,920
energy that's what it does admits it it

849
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:30,800
even spins around the cell turns around

850
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,800
and turns around and turns around

851
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,440
like and then as it's turning

852
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,560
around and doing that it goes up against

853
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,280
the pathogens if the cell is strong

854
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,680
enough the cell will go for a strong

855
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,800
enough pathogen it'll go for a stronger

856
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,280
one if the cell is too weak it'll go to

857
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,839
a weaker one and the same thing happens

858
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,839
again it goes into

859
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,440
war and it fights for its life to save

860
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:03,319
you it might might win it might eat up

861
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,400
the doile the docile pathogen but then

862
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:10,200
the one that's not so docile will come

863
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,800
in get into it break it down and explode

864
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,960
it and then what you'll have is an

865
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:18,280
immune cell that just exploded and

866
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:22,040
died that's how it

867
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,400
works and the game goes on and goes on

868
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,359
and goes on every day every hour as

869
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,200
we're sick

870
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:31,440
that's why medical medium has been

871
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,119
sitting

872
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,880
there talking and talking and talking

873
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:40,400
about Epstein bar talking about the flu

874
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,680
talking about all of it all this time

875
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,440
that's why medical meme

876
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,200
information was the first to put out the

877
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,079
Long Haul flu the flu breaking down your

878
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,880
immune system then being sick for months

879
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,160
because of the flu and then science took

880
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,480
it years and years and years later and

881
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,359
we have that documented by the way

882
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,960
and so and nowadays pathogens are

883
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,839
getting so strong we can do all the

884
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,760
right things and still we struggle to

885
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:09,720
fend them off because pathogens have

886
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,520
gotten stronger out there and so we have

887
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,240
to build up the immune systems is what

888
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,920
we have to do we have to build our

889
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,440
immune systems up so let's do a little

890
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,440
bit more

891
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,119
here

892
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,599
you'll see a big difference when you're

893
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,319
using the right tools have to have the

894
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:39,000
right tools it's critical big part of it

895
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:40,440
because we can make immune cells strong

896
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,880
they need to be fed so let's go into

897
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,480
that part

898
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,079
next you got a brand new immune cell

899
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,680
okay it's

900
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:53,520
weakened it's born weak it's not

901
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,240
emitting a lot of power

902
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:01,560
okay but it's hungry it's

903
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,599
hungry our immune cells are starving for

904
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,040
the right

905
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,040
things and we put Foods in there that

906
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,200
are not the right

907
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,440
things we put eggs in there we put dairy

908
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,760
in there we put gluten in there we put a

909
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,480
whole bunch of things that I've talked

910
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,280
about in there we put corn in there we

911
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,760
put all kinds of stuff in our body and

912
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,240
then we do high fat high fat high fat we

913
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,160
fat ourselves to death and when we just

914
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,880
pump in the fat the all all the overt

915
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,440
fat we pump in because everybody that's

916
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,319
what their meals are it's all fat and

917
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,720
when they pump in all that fat we lower

918
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:38,040
the immune system more and we starve the

919
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,440
immune cells so what people have are

920
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,560
starving immune cells our immune cells

921
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,720
want to thrive they want

922
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,640
Fuel and so when you look in the medical

923
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,760
medium books you'll see in there all

924
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,079
kinds of

925
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:55,560
stuff stuff that feeds the immune

926
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,880
cells that's critical for it how many

927
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,000
times have I talked about time tea

928
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,599
time right the herb

929
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,040
time how many times have I been here

930
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,240
live with you guys and talked about time

931
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,400
I don't know so many I can't count them

932
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
where I had a whole thing of time water

933
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,880
and I'm putting fresh time right in

934
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,720
there in the water and I'm like time you

935
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,880
guys

936
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,000
time how many times have I told you

937
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,359
about

938
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,200
time

939
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,359
okay tools that we need and so what I

940
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,240
love about time is time doesn't just

941
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,800
feed the immune

942
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,800
cell it doesn't just feed the immune

943
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,280
cell okay it

944
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,280
also

945
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,200
inhibits the

946
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:55,520
bugs when we have immune system problems

947
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,160
we need things that inhibit the bad guys

948
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,920
not just pour and feed our immune system

949
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,760
Julie Tuesday 144 by the way I read your

950
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,000
comments all the time you're you're like

you're always just putting out some

952
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,119
great stuff by the way um and then Sandy

953
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,680
says what brand is the immune blend in

954
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,720
viy right

955
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,800

rgy vimergy.com total immune blend

958
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,319
that's it right there it's time and

959
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,720

the shot

969
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,599
glass B to give me another one so what's

970
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,880
happening out there is women's immune

971
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,599
systems are lowering rapidly

972
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,680
that's what's happening in our

973
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,640
world the women on this planet are

974
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,560
getting sick sicker than they ever were

975
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,760
50 years ago sicker than they ever were

976
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,480
40 years

977
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:15,400
ago for the last two decades I've been

978
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,200
saying and even before

979
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,400
then that life expectancy is dropping

980
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,559
but they're not reporting it life

981
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,160
expectancy is dropping but they're not

982
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:28,200
reporting

983
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,960
it I have I've said this I've written it

984
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,119
in the books I've put it information

985
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,920
from s so in the books how life

986
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,480
expectancy is dropping but no no no

987
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,000
science is like we're only getting

988
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,960
better and better life expectancy is

989
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,200
getting better people are living longer

990
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,520
than ever before that's what they're

991
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,240
saying we have the technology we have

992
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,359
the medical technology and Kno how the

993
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,800
how to do we have it all people are

994
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,280
living longer and we should be Su we

995
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:59,160
should be proud of our

996
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:01,520
successes but it was a lot Li it was a

997
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,240
lie Spirit of compassion always told me

998
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,599
it was a lie and it was and now they're

999
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,119
faced with it they have no choice life

1000
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,880
expectancy is actually dropping life

1001
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,520
expectancy is dropping fast they know

1002
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,200
this they have it on record and they're

1003
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,000
still not reporting it correctly it's

1004
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,400
dropping faster and more grave than what

1005
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,359
they actually document it's even

1006
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,839
dropping faster than now what they're

1007
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:27,440
saying it's dropping medical me

1008
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,920
information was right once again again

1009
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,559
and proven right once again and that's

1010
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,920
the thing people who they make fun of mm

1011
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,200
info or me and they tell somebody keep

1012
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,960
in mind that it's proven right all the

1013
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,079
time constantly Pro way ahead of science

1014
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,400
and research over and over again and the

1015
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,119
life life expectancy is one of those

1016
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,599
things right there it's a medical medium

1017
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,480
win in the sense we're having Advanced

1018
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:53,720
information so you can protect yourself

1019
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,440
and you can look out for yourself and

1020
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,000
not be like well you know we're living

1021
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,520
forever I don't have to take care of

1022
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,800
myself they're saying life expectancy is

1023
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,559
just boo we're we're doing greater than

1024
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,240
ever the medical world has everything

1025
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,400
for me I could just live forever and

1026
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,599
ever I don't need to take care of myself

1027
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,839
that's why I call it a medical medium

1028
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,440
win it's because when you have the

1029
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,040
knowledge you get empowered and you can

1030
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,160
protect yourself what an incredible

1031
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,319
thing women's immune systems are

1032
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,160
lowering they already have immune system

1033
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,200
challenges during their cycle because

1034
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,000
menstration lowers the immune system

1035
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,920
menstration lowers the immune system by

1036
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,440
80% 20% of the immune

1037
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,599
system is looking after the rest of the

1038
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,240
body why 80% of of women's immune system

1039
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,960
is looking after the reproductive system

1040
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,599
and when this happens you catch the flu

1041
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,520
you catch the ebvs you catch the

1042
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:44,640
simplexes you catch the hhv6 you catch

1043
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,240
the shingles I forgot that one too you

1044
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,160
catch them all that's how it works

1045
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,079
people pass them around we get them we

1046
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,359
pick them up we get the strep all of it

1047
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,680
now we're sick with weird sinusitis and

1048
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,559
we're sick with weird UTI we never had

1049
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,079
and then then your acne kicks up that's

1050
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,200
the strep all on its own during you

1051
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,359
never noticed that women in their Cycles

1052
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,319
they have their cycle pre-cycle post um

1053
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:08,440
during cycle present cycle and post

1054
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,160
cycle all a sudden the acne kicks

1055
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,680
up it's like why is my acne kicking up

1056
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,359
during my cycle because the immune

1057
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,559
system is lowering that's why the immune

1058
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,680
system is

1059
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,079
lowering it's not hormones it's the

1060
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,079
immune system lowering that's how it

1061
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:24,200
goes and then shrep and pathogens kick

1062
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,920
up and they drive up right so women are

1063
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,160
already dealing with immune system

1064
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,240
challenges all on their own and then

1065
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,400
when we have pathogens plenty of them we

1066
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,359
end up in trouble again so we have the

1067
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:40,680
EBV we got that one right we got the

1068
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:44,920
strep got the HH you know we got the

1069
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,640
Herby Simplex right and the list goes on

1070
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,119
hhv7 you'll hear a lot about that pretty

1071
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,400
soon I've been talking about hhv7 for

1072
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,520
years and years and years you guys are

1073
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,480
going to hear a lot about that and then

1074
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,800
once again you're going be like medical

1075
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:00,240
M was right his information was right

1076
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,240
never ends

1077
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,040
okay all right so let's keep on going

1078
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,240
because we still have more to talk about

1079
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,680
the immune system and everything about

1080
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,559
it it's important Sayes says yep I

1081
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,240
always get colds around my period and

1082
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,440
that happens to so many women they get

1083
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,640
colds it gets flu they get pneumonia

1084
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,000
they get bronchitis during their period

1085
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,960
and around their period okay so we got a

1086
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,920
brand new immune cell that brand new IM

1087
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,400
immune cell is actually emitting lots of

1088
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,040
energy right on different parts of it

1089
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,520
still a little weaker on the sides but

1090
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,839
it needs to be fed because it's starving

1091
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,839
it's

1092
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,359
starving I don't know if that helps you

1093
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:43,359
guys I'm running starving upside down

1094
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:48,280
right there the immune cells are

1095
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,280
starving they need fuel in order to

1096
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,000
fight they need a little bit of zinc

1097
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,200
they need Molen they need th right they

1098
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,599
need the

1099
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,040

hungry okay so let's go into this

1105
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:22,599
now all right immune cells have to be

1106
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,440
fed they can't exist on their own cells

1107
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,280
need to be fed every single cell in your

1108
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,440
body needs fuel

1109
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,160
it needs the right trace minerals it

1110
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,280
needs phytochemical

1111
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,800
compounds it needs all these different

1112
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,119
things that are in our food which is

1113
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:42,119
critical I wish we only needed

1114
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:45,000
food I wish we only needed food and food

1115
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,440
only in this world that would be

1116
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,640
incredible and we do need food and

1117
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,440
listen a lot of people get better just

1118
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,440
on celery juice just on one thing just

1119
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,760
on some tools just on the healing broth

1120
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,119
just on the spinach soup I know people

1121
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,000
that say look I'm going to do spinach

1122
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:01,400
soup for like two weeks aw I'm like

1123
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,480
that's incredible they do spinach soup

1124
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,960
for two weeks they don't do anything

1125
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,520
else and they just start healing and

1126
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,880
they start recovering right the medical

1127
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,040
mem spinach

1128
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,000
soup the point is is that we can do a

1129
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,960
lot with food and we need to keep that

1130
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,280
food going in we got to keep the bad

1131
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:19,280
stuff out when we can we got to keep the

1132
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,559
bad stuff out right we got to keep the

1133
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,920
gluten out and all the vinegar is out

1134
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,640
and everything else we got to keep the

1135
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,280
bad stuff out because it it boggles down

1136
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,960
our immune

1137
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,160
cells but we need things that feed the

1138
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,760

package it up into like Darkness and

1195
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:45,000
Light a spiritual war right here in a

1196
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:46,440
sandwich you got some foods in here that

1197
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,480
are trying to save you and feed your

1198
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,799
immune cells you got some foods in here

1199
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,119
are trying to take down your immune

1200
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:56,839
cells by feeding all the pathogens it's

1201
00:50:52,119 --> 00:51:00,799
dark and light it's good and evil

1202
00:50:56,839 --> 00:51:00,799
all packed up right here in a

1203
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:10,760

tea time

1207
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,040
tea because time is critical for our

1208
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,839
immune systems and what we go through it

1209
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,720

mindblowing and I don't care what

1215
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,920

1227
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,319
excited about like I'm passionate about

1228
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,720
this I'm excited about this because more

1229
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:14,480
tools that I know can feed an immune

1230
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:16,799
cell and help restore it and fight the

1231
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,119
evil the darkness the pathogens that are

1232
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:22,760

place that's what matters right there

1238
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,319
right there so that's the total immune

1239
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,720
blend it's got the Mullen it's got the

1240
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:44,640
thyme I never doubt the Vim stuff

1241
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,160
because they take it to the next level

1242
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,119
and they always surprise me and they

1243
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,839

1244
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,280

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,640
bit you have it in you to have the

1278
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,200
strongest immune cells I'm going to tell

1279
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:30,920
you right now you guys you have it in

1280
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,880
you to have the strongest immune cells

1281
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:37,319
okay you do I don't care if you've been

1282
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:40,440
sick for 20 years you have it in you to

1283
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,440
have the strongest immune

1284
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:48,440
cells try not to strip on that

1285
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:50,440
okay when you do stuff that's critical

1286
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,680
for your immune system when you get the

1287
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,720
junk out like in the medical meme

1288
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,200
information you're doing your hmds

1289
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:59,280
you're doing the things you need to do

1290
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:03,280
right yep verus spiritual tasting the

1291
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,319
healing exactly Kim says what is the

1292
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,520
name of the Bimmer product is called

1293
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:11,040
total immune blend is what it

1294
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,079
is total immune blend I'll put that

1295
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,520
right up to

1296
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:18,680
you

1297
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,960
okay a new immune cell is

1298
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,640
born another immune cell is

1299
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:30,240
born another one is born

1300
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,240
name them what you will they're all just

1301
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,000
names

1302
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:38,200
lymphocytes nutrifil basophils killer

1303
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,920
cells white blood cells name them what

1304
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,839
you want they're all just names but you

1305
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,559
got a host of immune cells inside your

1306
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,200
body they're all just names that some

1307
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:49,880
guy came up

1308
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,880
with right the medical industry is like

1309
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,599
well we think we found an immune cell we

1310
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,799
might name it let's name it okay we're

1311
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,480
going to name that one a lymphocyte oh I

1312
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,839
think we found it me cell again we're

1313
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,240
going to name that one something else

1314
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,400
they're just naming them

1315
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,280
right I I tend to not like try to use

1316
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:10,960
the names

1317
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,079
because is that the real

1318
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,799
name is that the real name of an immune

1319
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,920
cell I think about that all the time

1320
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:19,359
because every time I talk to S so s so

1321
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,760
is like yeah that's some guy in a lab

1322
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,200
that's like we're going to name that a

1323
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,200
killer

1324
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,039
cell so what what you have is your

1325
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:33,280
immune cells right they're born

1326
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:36,599
constantly and when you feed

1327
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,880
them they strengthen and they start to

1328
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,880
have the ability to gather more

1329
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,839
intelligence not only are pathogens

1330
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,520
highly

1331
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,160
intelligent not only are bad pathogens

1332
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,680
highly intelligent here's one right here

1333
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:55,559
an EBV here's a a shingles here's a um

1334
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:58,559
herpy simplex one right

1335
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:01,520
here's a strep antibiotic resistant

1336
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,039
strep not only are they

1337
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,319
intelligent and can get more intelligent

1338
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:08,799
as time goes on your immune cells can

1339
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:12,760
too but the only way for your immune

1340
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:15,039
cells to get smart is you have to feed

1341
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,160
them they need

1342
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:20,520
things they need

1343
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,520
garlic they need

1344
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:26,160
spirina they need things they need

1345
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:29,319
tomatoes they need Apple

1346
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:34,000
they need celery celery

1347
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:38,839
juice and then they need potent herbs

1348
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:42,319
Molin the total immune thyme the total

1349
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,319
immune they need

1350
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,839
zinc they need to be fed they need trace

1351
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:49,319
minerals phytochemical compounds within

1352
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,160
the

1353
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:55,640
herbs and as they get

1354
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,359
stronger and they win a battle

1355
00:57:55,640 --> 00:58:00,280
okay and then they win a battle against

1356
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:03,280
an evil

1357
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:07,480
bug and that immune cell radiate

1358
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,640
strength and vibrancy and it weakens

1359
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:13,599
that pathogen and then it wins the

1360
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,760
battle quickly it it ascends upon that

1361
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:21,960
pathogen and then eats it

1362
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:25,280
up and cancels it out it now gains

1363
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,240
intelligence back it strengthens

1364
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,319
and it gains the intelligence

1365
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:34,160
back and then it's

1366
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:38,079
stronger it's smarter it goes for

1367
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:41,880
another one does the same thing weakens

1368
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:43,880
it crushes it and gains intelligence and

1369
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:46,480
then that immune cell might lose a

1370
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,119
battle because it's eating so many bad

1371
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,359
boys up so many of them up that if

1372
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,960
someone has a little too many of the

1373
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,119
ebvs and they got four different

1374
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,280
varieties of Epstein bar they got four

1375
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,720
two varieties of shingles and they got

1376
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:03,680
an HPV they got a ceglar virus they got

1377
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:06,359
a simplex one and that immune

1378
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:10,240
cell can't handle them all and

1379
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:10,240
eventually burns out like a

1380
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,640
star in the

1381
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,480
universe and when it burns

1382
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:20,480
out it

1383
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,000
dies but in that

1384
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,039
process it did something that you guys

1385
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,799
don't

1386
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:34,960
know you know what it did it passed down

1387
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:37,240
information to other immune cells look

1388
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,240
at

1389
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,720
that and then those immune cells pass

1390
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:47,480
down information to other immune

1391
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:49,799
cells and then the war goes on and

1392
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,440
you're winning the

1393
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:54,880
war your fibro is getting better your

1394
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,400
Lyme disease is getting better your ra

1395
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,760
is getting better your life is getting

1396
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,240
better whatever it is you have your

1397
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,119
autoimmune is getting better things are

1398
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,200
getting better your immune cells can

1399
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,400
strengthen when they're fed the right

1400
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,680
things they can grow and strengthen and

1401
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,680
they can beat out the bad

1402
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,359
guys and

1403
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,200
that's what it's all

1404
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:21,960
about right

1405
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,599
there medical medium tools are about

1406
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,960
destroying the bad guys cleaning out the

1407
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,440
junk that feeds the bad guys getting rid

1408
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,359
of the foods that feed the bad guys and

1409
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,200
supporting your immune system and your

1410
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,559
organs with the good stuff that's what

1411
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,000
it's about because people walk around

1412
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,839
with broken busted immune systems and

1413
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,839
they're sick and they stay sick and

1414
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:44,920
they're constantly flared up and they

1415
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:47,640
get flared up again and then somebody

1416
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:49,359
out there says go try this don't do that

1417
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,880
and they go try it they're flared up

1418
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,440
more and someone else is like no you

1419
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,559
should do this and only do this only do

1420
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,960
carnivore nothing else else and they

1421
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:59,680
just be like try that and they get

1422
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,520
sicker in six months and they like no

1423
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,119
just eat what you want just only eat

1424
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,119
what you want that makes you happy and

1425
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,520
then when you're happy you heal and they

1426
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,680
do that one and they're just like boom

1427
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,839
then now they're sick all over again or

1428
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,359
they'll be like do this one and do that

1429
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:17,559
that one and do this one it's never

1430
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:19,440
ending and mm info is about restoring

1431
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:21,440
those immune cells recovering them

1432
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,039
restoring them making them stronger

1433
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,720
getting the intelligence Factor up on

1434
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:31,480
all those immune cells so the intellect

1435
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:34,119
on each immune cell is strong powerful

1436
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,520
so admits what this is going to happen

1437
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:38,079
here as I clean this board one more time

1438
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,079
for you

1439
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,079
guys

1440
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,319
hello all

1441
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,039
right how's

1442
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,440
that

1443
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,079
a cell is born you've been working on

1444
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,319
your healing process for quite a while

1445
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:07,119
you've been doing your celery juice your

1446
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:07,119
hmds you've been using

1447
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,640
tools you've been working on your Foods

1448
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,160
you've been keeping out the foods that

1449
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:16,279
don't serve you I'm starting to use that

1450
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,520
term I don't like that term it's like

1451
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:22,599
whatever serves you that doesn't serve

1452
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,760
me people hear that all the time do what

1453
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:29,559
serves you it's like

1454
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:32,520
all of it keeping Foods out that do not

1455
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:36,640
help you

1456
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:39,200
okay and then a cell is born you guys

1457
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,240
that's right Envision that cell because

1458
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,480
that cell's inside of

1459
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:52,000
you envision it and see

1460
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:54,680
it a cell is born inside of you that has

1461
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,200
Intelligence and strength in and it

1462
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:01,160
wields a sword and that sword is going

1463
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:05,920
to go right through those pathogens and

1464
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,920
Destroy them the darkness and the

1465
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,799
evil a cell is

1466
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,160
born it's got a strength to it it's got

1467
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:18,839
no indentations it's not tattered it's

1468
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,000
got no divots in it it's got no pivots

1469
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:24,319
in it

1470
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,200
either the membrane is Juicy the me

1471
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:30,079
mebrane is

1472
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:33,119
strong and it admits that

1473
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:35,799
frequency but it admits it everywhere

1474
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,440
see this cuz you've been doing the work

1475
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:39,440
and you've been working on yourself and

1476
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,240
getting what you need and that strength

1477
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,559
is admitting

1478
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,920
everywhere and that's your immune cell

1479
01:03:43,559 --> 01:03:48,760
right there you have it in you it's

1480
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,480
there and many of you have ignited those

1481
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,839
already and you have won battles after

1482
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:56,760
battles and you've gotten rid of 50

1483
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:59,319
symptoms I see it on YouTube I see it in

1484
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:00,960
your comment section I see it in so many

1485
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:05,440
like in the comment section you guys are

1486
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,440
leaving I read them all I read them

1487
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:11,400
all and you guys are winning those

1488
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:13,599
battles and your immune cell is crushing

1489
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,640
it and destroying those Invaders and

1490
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:18,799
those pathogens because you guys have

1491
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:21,319
been giving your immune cells what they

1492
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,440
need and that's your immune cell right

1493
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:26,480
there that you guys are building it is

1494
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,880
strong it is powerful it is nothing to

1495
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,839
be messed with and when an Invader comes

1496
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:35,720
around it crushes it when those Invaders

1497
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:38,359
come around the evbs and the simplexes

1498
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,440
and the shingles and the strep and maybe

1499
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:43,200
you don't know any you have any of this

1500
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,440
you're just sick then just do this then

1501
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,760
you're sick something's in you because

1502
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,279
you don't know maybe you didn't learn

1503
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:50,599
yet and you don't know the bugs that are

1504
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:52,760
in you you have no idea fine then

1505
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:54,839
something is just keeping you sick

1506
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,039
whatever it is

1507
01:04:54,839 --> 01:04:58,599
in your head in the sense where you're

1508
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,160
really sick but in your head you're

1509
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,720
thinking I don't know why I'm sick

1510
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,680
something's doing it whatever it is that

1511
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,760
you

1512
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:10,240
believe your immune cell is strong and

1513
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:12,599
it's vital and it starts to spin around

1514
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,720
and spit around and spit around and what

1515
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:17,839
happens is that it's turning and science

1516
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:21,119
doesn't have that Peg they don't know

1517
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:23,079
about this they don't study a cell

1518
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,640
through its

1519
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:25,480
fruition

1520
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,960
they

1521
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:31,760
don't they don't study

1522
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:34,279
it from its birth because they don't

1523
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,559
follow a cell science doesn't know how

1524
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:37,680
to follow a cell they can't they don't

1525
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:40,160
have the technology to follow a

1526
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,640
cell they can't they can only they can't

1527
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,400
follow it in the body when it's coming

1528
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,720
out of a bone and then it's just growing

1529
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,160
through your and it's moving through

1530
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,400
your body they're not following it being

1531
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:52,480
like there's that cell we got our eye on

1532
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,039
it it's not like a bird that they're

1533
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,839
watching and they put a little tag at

1534
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:58,839
it's not a penguin they put a little tag

1535
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,760
in its ear because it's

1536
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:02,400
endangered and they're trying to keep an

1537
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,680
eye on it so they send some people up

1538
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,079
there to the Arctic and they're and

1539
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,400
they're looking for that penguin that

1540
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:08,079
actually has a little red tag in its ear

1541
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,200
it's

1542
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:15,359
fin It's

1543
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:18,039
Finn I don't know penguins have ears but

1544
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:20,839
keep in mind that that cell starts to

1545
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:23,760
spin and it starts to rotate and it has

1546
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:25,760
strength like no other and when you feed

1547
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,520
these cells they can turn into this and

1548
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,880
in your body you will have the strength

1549
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,920
and it will do this and then when it

1550
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,240
comes across these pathogens what it

1551
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,599
does and this is incredible I'm going to

1552
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,240
tell you right now and this is what some

1553
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:38,200
of you are doing right now when you do

1554
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,319
medical

1555
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,559
medium I can't speak for other

1556
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:44,880
modalities and other things out there

1557
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,640
and other whatever Lifestyles or

1558
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,640
whatever they call it out there I can't

1559
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:50,559
I can't speak for all those but I can

1560
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,640
speak for medical medium information and

1561
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,039
when your cell gets strong and stronger

1562
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,799
and stronger and it starts to Road

1563
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:58,960
rotate it runs across all the bad bugs

1564
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,119
right there and what it does it radiates

1565
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,720
this powerful powerful light out of that

1566
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:07,559
cell that blue light and as it radiates

1567
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:10,200
out it puts everything docile everything

1568
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,680
goes to sleep around it all your streps

1569
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,039
all your five different strips that are

1570
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,240
antibiotic resistant all your different

1571
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:18,520
ebvs that you have all your different

1572
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,960
shingles that you have everything it

1573
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:23,400
completely puts it into a trance like

1574
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,079
this you see this into a spell it spell

1575
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,839
bounds it and then it goes and it

1576
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,839
gobbles every single one of them up

1577
01:07:28,839 --> 01:07:33,200
that's what it does all like this that's

1578
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:35,799
the cell we have it goes like this and

1579
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,279
it gobbles every last one of them up and

1580
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:40,480
it wipes it clean and then it heads down

1581
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:42,359
into your liver and it does it all over

1582
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,640
again and then you start healing on

1583
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:47,960
medical medium and you start recovering

1584
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,960
and that's what happens right

1585
01:07:49,279 --> 01:07:53,160
there we are up against the strongest

1586
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,640
pathogens we've ever faced in history

1587
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:57,160
they're out there now they continue to

1588
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,359
strengthen but we don't have

1589
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:05,160
to live by that Madness can take care of

1590
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:05,160
ourselves do what we need for

1591
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:13,039
ourselves anyway check out total immune

1592
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:15,400
blend I hope you enjoyed the show it's

1593
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,520
information from Spirit of

1594
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:20,759
compassion I've been teaching on and off

1595
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,759
for

1596
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:29,159
years that I've been

1597
01:08:25,159 --> 01:08:29,159
messaging all these all these

1598
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,400
years messaging to others they could

1599
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,799
become their own experts and they can

1600
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:40,000
teach

1601
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:43,040
others I wish I can call myself a

1602
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,440
teacher I want to so bad but I can't

1603
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,080
teacher is somebody who's a researcher

1604
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:49,199
and they learn through

1605
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,600
researching and then they go and teach

1606
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:53,560
it I don't learn through

1607
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,920
researching I want to call myself a

1608
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:57,400
teacher teacher bad but I can't cuz

1609
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,120
Spirit of compassion says you're not a

1610
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,159
teacher you're a

1611
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,040
messenger because I'm not out there

1612
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:08,279
researching I'm not out there you

1613
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,640
know doing all that and then teaching

1614
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:13,040
what I learned from the Internet or

1615
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,040
whatever and that's a

1616
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,839
teacher but I'm just a little old

1617
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,960
messenger and I have to accept that and

1618
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:22,719
be that CU I know people have a lot of

1619
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,239
respect for teachers and I don't know if

1620
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,640
they have a lot of respect for mess

1621
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:32,440
so but got to be what I got to

1622
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:34,359
be anyway check it out total immune

1623
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,480
blend right

1624
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:39,560
there link is in the bio I'm going to

1625
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:42,040
pop a little water in here and I'm going

1626
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,040
to send it

1627
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,719
down bartender give me another I'll take

1628
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:50,799
that have compassion for your body's

1629
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,560
immune systems have respect for your

1630
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,719
body's immune systems are working hard

1631
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,280
for you they're not attacking you

1632
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,960
they're not and that takes me to this

1633
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,840
next place of how evil things are out

1634
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,640
there because the industry both

1635
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,920
alternative medicine unfortunately and

1636
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,360
conventional medicine believe your

1679
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,880
garbage in

1680
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,840
it like all these years the stuff that's

1681
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,920
been in there well the companies they

1682
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,480
have to kind of morph they chameleon and

1683
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,840
they they look at what vimer is doing

1684
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:51,400
and then they start kicking out kicking

1685
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,800
away the citric acid and they make it

1686
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:54,280
look like that they've always been like

1687
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,000
that and nobody knows the person who

1688
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,600
goes and buys their product doesn't know

1689
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,320
that they had this in there last year

1690
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:03,040
and this in here 5 years ago and this in

1691
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:04,400
here they got a dirty nasty gnarly past

1692
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,159
and they have it in their

1693
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,000
supplementations in their supplement

1694
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:10,199
companies and what happens is nobody

1695
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,560
realizes this and so they try to make

1696
01:12:10,199 --> 01:12:12,960
themselves look squeaky clean now but

1697
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,679
they're still using glow grade stuff and

1698
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,880
they're like oh we don't use citric acid

1699
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:17,440
anymore where'd you get that from

1700
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,600
because that's medical medum information

1701
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,480
and citric acid is bad for you that's

1702
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,280
been put in supplements we don't use

1703
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,960

1704
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,560

01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,440
years say that you need alcohol in your

1706
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,639
supplements in your in your herbal

1707
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,360

1708
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,440
there's no alcohol in them anymore oh we

1709
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:37,080

emanate they try to actually copycat

1715
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,840
like a company like Viki and then nobody

1716
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:52,040
knows about the dirty past and they

1717
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,480
