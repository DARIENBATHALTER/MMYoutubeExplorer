life life to provide real answers for

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,920
countless people for decades and much of

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
the information has been proven over the

67
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,400
years as the years have gone by it's

68
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,599
been proven even by science of

69
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,920
information that have brought to the

70
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,519
table and so much of it that I've

71
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,959
brought for us hasn't been yet

72
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,360
discovered by research or science and

73
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,120
it's still years years down the road in

74
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,040
ahead but I always want you to have that

75
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,400
information now I don't want you waiting

76
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,760
it doesn't make any sense to wait you

77
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,879
know and there's something important for

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,000
you to know is as you listen you may see

79
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,319
that sometimes this information that I'm

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,440
sharing with you will seem the like the

81
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,720
opposite of what you've heard before

82
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,280
when it comes down to Something in

83
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,599
health or something in cancer or

84
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,720
something like that but don't be alarmed

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,360
there could be good reason and very good

86
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,159
reason why it's the opposite to protect

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,319
you so keep that in mind as you're

88
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,080
listening to this and going through this

89
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,560
and sometimes you'll notice that the

90
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,799
information could be similar to other

91
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,920
sources but there's subtle and different

92
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,560
critical differences that make the

93
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,360
difference there's critical differences

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,799
in the information and you might not be

95
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,560
able to see that right off the bat and

96
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,440
say oh well oh god I've heard that

97
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,760
before no there could be a subtle

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,480
critical difference because it matters

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,280
because information as it goes down the

100
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,480
line gets messed with

101
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,519
as it goes down the line the Common

102
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Thread with the information you're going

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,360
to get today is that it's the truth and

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm not talking about truth that has

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,200
been altered truth that has been tainted

106
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,799
truth that has been

107
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,120
skewed along the way I'm not talking

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
about that kind of truth that even the

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
best the best well-known experts are

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
speaking out there but don't realize

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
there's something in there that's not in

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,360
your best interest the information

113
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,799

repackaged and it's not recycled Theory

115
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,120
made to sound like something new you

116
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,480
know this this information you'll hear

117
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,400
doesn't come from interest groups

118
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,760
medical funding with strings attached

119
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,519
botched research lobbyists internal

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,519
Kickbacks yeah persuaded belief

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,759

122
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:27,479
influencers and health PE health field

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,680
payoffs or even trendy traps that are

124
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,919
both in conven

125
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,440
and alternative medicine that are both

126
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:39,039
in conventional and alternative me

127
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,680
medicine seriously you know when I say

128
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,800
that I still can't even believe it but

129
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,160

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,639
important because those groups come

137
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,160
along with with even the best

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,400
alternative information that people and

139
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,360

in the world either way but it's

177
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,199
important information and my personal

178
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,880
experience with cancer you guys started

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,720
at age four when I discovered my

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,840
grandmother had lung cancer so I was the

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,199
one and actually saw that she had lung

182
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,560
cancer and many of you probably know

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,400
that story and how it went but it but

184
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,680
that was my first personal experience

185
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,800
and since then though through the

186
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,560
decades I've actually seen cancer in so

187
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,080
many different people cancer that has

188
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,960
developed in so many different people

189
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,120
along Ong the way and I've taken it

190
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,479
extremely personal because of my

191
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,440
grandmother number one and number two

192
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,919
because of the nature of it and what we

193
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,080
go through in health and everything else

194
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,440
so I'm going to provide key pieces to

195
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,479
cancer that you should know and of

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,000
course Epstein bar which has a reason

197
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,879
for why we're doing that today too which

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,479
you'll you'll you'll figure out out

199
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,280
along the way as we talk about it and so

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,360
we're taking this serious today we

201
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,039
really are cancer and EBV cancer and

202
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,080
epsteam bar we're taking this serious

203
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,560
you know so when I diagnosed my

204
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,680
grandmother of lung cancer at age 4 I've

205
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,800
seen a lot of people just in as a child

206
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,039
I'd be in a busy place or being a movie

207
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,440
theater and be able to know if someone

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,159
had cancer in the movie theater and

209
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,800
whatever kind of cancer and variety of

210
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,000
cancer now the good thing about the gift

211
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,240
the wonderful good thing about the gift

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,319
that I've been given is you get to know

213
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,879
what's behind the cancer what's really

214
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,919
the starting point when did it start how

215
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,680
did it start in someone what was it see

216
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,919
medicine today you guys medicine today

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,039
just focuses on cancer once it's been

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,840
created once something's been created

219
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,319
once something's developed and

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,440
manifested that's what cancer research

221
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,479
is about it's about that point cancer

222
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,719
research really isn't about anything

223
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,719
before that and if it is it's about

224
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,760
something entirely wrong which we're

225
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,479
going to talk about and I could say that

226
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,919
and it's going to be a mindblower that

227
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,680
there's a fa there's a piece of fabric

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,160
about the study of cancer today that

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,680
isn't really

230
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,399
correct and so the the information has

231
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,320
to be out there about really how does it

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,519
start how can a cancer cell become a

233
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:03,680
cancer cell how can a cancer cell grow

234
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,000
how and what and why what's really going

235
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,399
on and that's what we're talking about

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,040
today I mean we only have a certain

237
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,200
amount of time of course so I can't go

238
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,200
on and on and on about hundreds of

239
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,600
different varieties of cancer and all

240
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,600
the different research that's out there

241
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,120
today and the whole bit and we'll do

242
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,720
more of these we're going to do more of

243
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,480
these along the way so we cover more and

244
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,200
more but we're going to cover key

245
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,560
critical critical points that are so

246
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,920
important and information that is so

247
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,279
important so I just want to give you

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,320
that whole

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,079
background now let's go into history

250
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
just a little bit now there I'm sure

251
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,279
there's some cancer experts that are

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,959
actually just listening to this for sure

253
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,279
now and different Physicians and

254
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,760
different professionals and different

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
people all around and people that aren't

256
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,360
even doctors that are that are experts

257
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
in cancer because they've experienced it

258
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,680
or they've known somebody or anything

259
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,640
like that or they just researching

260
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,959
constantly and I get that so if you know

261
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,440
some research you know that cancer we've

262
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:05,040
been told cancer goes back a long way it

263
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,519
goes back years and years and years and

264
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,640
years before us so that's what we've

265
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,800
been told Cancer's it's really old it's

266
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,360
old in our history it goes back farther

267
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,200
and further like for instance you may

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
hear that cancer is a thousand years old

269
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,560
and then you may hear that there's

270
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,800
people with cancer that you know are

271
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,720
2,000 years ago maybe they found a mummy

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,160
with cancer okay and then you may hear

273
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,399
that just 500 years ago

274
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,440
okay or you know go back to 400 BC all

275
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,000
right when the word cancer was was

276
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,360
created it's a Greek word so that word

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,200
was created that's a Greek word cancer

278
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,320
for a sickness in the body so you would

279
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,160
think well cancer started really early

280
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,800
because 400 BC that's when cancer first

281
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,880
started so and you're going to hear

282
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,480
eventually and you're going to hear

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,120
eventually that you know and I ican an

284
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,560
ican has cancer and they got it under

285
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,959
study you know somebody they found in

286
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,560
ice 10,000 years ago 12,000 years ago

287
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,800
next to a mammoth and they're going to

288
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,760
say well you know science research going

289
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,240
to say well cancer goes back as far as

290
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,399
woo the time of the mammoths and you're

291
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,920
going to hear

292
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,800
that but I have to be straight with you

293
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,279
guys I have to be straight up all right

294
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,279
and remember I told you to fast of no

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,920
seat belts there's reason for this for

296
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,360
this trip for this ride there's

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:40,839
reasons see we've been had that's

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,959
misinformation cancer is Young extremely

299
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,480
young in history and I'm going to talk

300
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,560
about how and why and what see you have

301
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,680
to understand something when the term

302
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,800
cancer in 400 BC around 400 BC they're

303
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,560
around that time frame when the Greeks

304
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,959
came up with the term cancer they were

305
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,160
talking about a tumor but they weren't

306
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,200
w't talking about cancer cells in a

307
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,519
tumor they weren't talking about

308
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,079
malignant cancer cells in a tumor that

309
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,680
word was developed for benign

310
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,360
tumors for benign

311
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,320
tumors that's where that word was

312
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,519
developed it was also developed off of

313
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Just sickness that grew whether it even

314
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,880
wasn't a tumor it didn't even have to be

315
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,680
a tumor for that word to be used when it

316
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,839
was first invented is first first that

317
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,040
word was first you know

318
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,839
pronounced so that means if someone was

319
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,120
dying of some type of toxin or illness

320
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,760
or something back you know over 2,000

321
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,959
years ago the word cancer was applied

322
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,199
all the

323
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:53,639
time all of the time it was applied

324
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:56,320
tumor no tumor um being able to see a

325
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,279
disease or not it was applied so you

326
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,720
need to understand that this is really

327
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,959
important

328
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:08,800
okay any kind of tumors that were even

329
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:11,519
found in the 1400s 1500s 1600s weren't

330
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,279
cancerous could they have killed someone

331
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,000
yes growing the wrong way growing in the

332
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,320
wrong place absolutely growing up

333
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,880
against an organ pushing up against a

334
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,320
vein pushing up is very easy back in

335
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,519
that day for anything to pretty much

336
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,519
take you

337
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,320
out and but

338
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,720
these

339
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:39,399
tumors weren't the cancer we speak of we

340
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,920
see we talk about today at all now why

341
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,040
is this why isn't this corrected

342
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,120
anywhere why isn't this corrected with

343
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,160
the experts why aren't they correcting

344
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,040
it because they don't know better I'm

345
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
sorry to say and there's a reason for

346
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,720
this it's not their fault not their

347
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,959
fault at all the reason why no one's

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,639
corrected with this is because medicine

349
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:05,000
today has to put the blame on you it has

350
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:07,680
to put the blame on you you need to know

351
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,040
that's how it's all been set up okay and

352
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,800
hang on hang on hang on this is going to

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,680
be okay get some tea out get some tea

354
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,079
out okay maybe some some lemon balm tea

355
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,279
or some relaxing tea because this is

356
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,600
hard this is hard to digest maybe some

357
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,120
peppermint tea cuz with you know it

358
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,759
helps you digest food so we'll get the

359
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,320
helps your digestion improve we'll get

360
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,759
some peppermint tea

361
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,000
out see the fault has to be put on you

362
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,399
same thing I talk about all the time

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,040
with autoimmune disease we're we're told

364
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,440
that the body is attacking itself that

365
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,399
the body literally is destroying itself

366
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
with any kind of autoimmune disease

367
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,199
that's incorrect information as I've

368
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,560
talked about many times there's

369
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,519
pathogens that are the cause of the

370
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,279
damage being done or the inflammation

371
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:58,440
that's occurring the body produces an

372
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,120
antibody not to destroy the body or hurt

373
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,959
the body body on any level but to go

374
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,800
after the virus it's not autoimmune see

375
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,959
that part isn't even corrected yet but

376
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,680
the blame is always it's not corrected

377
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,040
out there except I was the first person

378
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,600
to actually get it out there now it's

379
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,800
starting to get out there thank God and

380
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,920
it will be proven I promise you this but

381
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:23,279
the point is is for you to believe that

382
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
it's always your fault so no matter what

383
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,399
so whatever kind of chronic fatigue or

384
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,639
sickness or disease or illness or rash

385
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:34,759
or disord order it's it's it's just you

386
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,199
and this is how it's always been set up

387
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,360
so if the truth came out the real truth

388
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,040
and you knew that you weren't

389
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,839
responsible for your cancer or cancer

390
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,720
just didn't afflict you it didn't

391
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,639
naturally afflict you just came on to

392
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,920
you because that's the way it's been for

393
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,720
thousands of years which is the wrong

394
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:57,199
information if you knew the truth that

395
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,079
it was somebody else's fault and if the

396
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,519
world knew that things would start

397
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:05,240
falling apart the things would start

398
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,959
falling apart in medicine and research

399
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,360
and everything else so the pattern for

400
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,000
medicine is always going to be heading

401
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,880
in the direction it's your fault you got

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,560
bad genes your body's attacking itself

403
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,519
and destroying itself you're creating

404
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,560
your problem you're eating too much

405
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,120
you're not taking care of yourself

406
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,519
you're doing whatever whatever it is

407
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,680
it's going to point there in

408
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:35,199
medicine but with

409
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,440
cancer Cancer's an early epidemic really

410
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,399
early I mean not early start just

411
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,880
recently early is what I mean that's

412
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,040
what I'm trying to say here it's

413
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,680
recent it's

414
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,600
recent and it's not as far back going

415
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,000
all the way as we think it is so when

416
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,920
did the first real cancer start to

417
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,319
develop into cancer meaning it left just

418
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,360
the word itself and turned into a

419
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:05,039
malignant cell a cancerous cell a cell

420
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,679
that became destructive or a tumor that

421
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,959
became filled with malignant cells and

422
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,799
so forth when did that all start right

423
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,199
in the late

424
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,679
1700s the late

425
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
1700s that's when the first cancer

426
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,160
started that alone is important to

427
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,400
understand for so many reasons that's

428
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:30,520
when the first cancer started and those

429
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,320
cancers weren't the cancers we're

430
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,280
dealing with now today they weren't

431
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,240
those

432
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,360
cancers they weren't in fact in the late

433
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,919
very late 1700s there was only basically

434
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,360
one variety of cancer

435
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:53,320
docile slow to the punch not problematic

436
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:56,440
barely problematic and then by the 1830s

437
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:59,000
1840s a couple of other cancer varieties

438
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,679
stemmed from it still

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,799
doile but a little bit more aggressive a

440
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,960
little bit more

441
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,320
worse the first cancer started around

442
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,559
the Industrial Revolution the Industrial

443
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,600
Revolution which gave that was the birth

444
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:20,440
of chemistry that was the birth of the

445
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,320
chemical world this is when cancer

446
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,440
started understand that it started when

447
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,760
man started playing with chemicals

448
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,039
started playing with chemicals in the

449
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,480
lab chemistry

450
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,760
that's when it first started and those

451
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,840
chemicals were were created and worked

452
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,440
on and being the chemical world was

453
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,640
being built the industrial world was

454
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600
being built we were burning things in

455
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,480
the air we never burnt before we were

456
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,159
playing with different things we were

457
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,120
synthesizing synthesizing different

458
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,159
things different chemical compounds

459
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,200
different agents that we were we were

460
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,240
playing with we were mixing

461
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,880
metals and we were learning how to use

462
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,600
chemistry for the first time in history

463
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,679
really learning how to use chemistry for

464
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
the first time in in history and we are

465
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,919
learning how to do things with it we are

466
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,640
learning how to play with metal with it

467
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:21,600
to change the structure of

468
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,840
metals and to even do more than that and

469
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,480
we were burning chemicals and burning

470
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,960
them and they weren't the chemicals we

471
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,200
have today which is why the

472
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,640
cancers weren't so bad the cancers

473
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,240
weren't so bad at this point now of

474
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,720
course in the in the you know 1700s and

475
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,360
1800s we had all kinds of different

476
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
tumors and we had different varieties of

477
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,720
tumors and they were getting worse

478
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,080
benign tumors different illnesses

479
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,400
different sicknesses to that point but

480
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,880
cancer itself cancer itself and the

481
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,080
cells of cancer wasn't in its you know

482
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,640
great day at that point at all but it's

483
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,559
the birth of the basically the

484
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,640
industries it was the birth of the

485
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,520
chemical playing around with chemicals

486
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,400
and the

487
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,880
industries okay and here's the deal now

488
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,480
as we go today now where we are today

489
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,960
there are a lot of different varieties

490
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,720
of cancers now we know that you know

491
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,600
that not telling you anything

492
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,320
new and but what there is there's a lot

493
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,720
of different

494
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:31,799
variations of why someone gets a cancer

495
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,159
to what degree they get a cancer to what

496
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:38,640
degree so all kinds of different

497
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,440
variables lots of them okay now science

498
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,760
and research doesn't care about the

499
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,559
variables so Medical Science medical

500
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,480
research doesn't care about all those

501
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,679
they don't care about all the different

502
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,720
variables we're not there yet you know

503
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,240
as far as science and research goes no

504
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,720
one cares about all the different

505
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,000
reasons someone gets a certain cancer

506
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,240
and someone else doesn't or someone gets

507
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,840
a certain variety of a mutated version

508
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,000
of a Cancer and someone doesn't or

509
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,679
someone gets sick in a certain way with

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,120
the cancer like someone it kills someone

511
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,880
but doesn't kill another person all

512
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,279
these different variables and there's so

513
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,600
many in the mix and to what degree

514
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:27,799
someone gets cancer and who gets the

515
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,919
cancer and because the reason why it's

516
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:34,720
all all Man Behind cancer to begin with

517
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm not talking about uh any bad people

518
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,400
you know that are trying to help people

519
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,120
and help care people of cancer and help

520
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm not talking about that I'm talking

521
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,360
about I'm talking about all the

522
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,679
different things created of why we deal

523
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,080
with cancer now exposure talking about

524
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,400
solvents all the different solvents were

525
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,400
exposed to all the time and the chemical

526
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,279
agents all the different chemical agents

527
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,159
were were thousands of chemical agents

528
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:01,520
all the different pesticides herbicides

529
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,880
fungicides

530
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,440
rodenticides um insecticides whatever

531
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,720
all those different

532
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,400
ones radiation exposure not just

533
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,240
radiation different types of radiation

534
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,400
different types of radiation exposure

535
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:23,840
all the time and that's just a fraction

536
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:27,720
of it then there's something else see

537
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,440
someone has to have two things there has

538
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,360
to be two things that someone has to

539
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,520
have in their body to create the

540
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,400
possibility of cancer there has to be

541
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,279
two things in someone's body you guys to

542
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,480
create cancer even though there's all

543
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,840
these different solvents and these

544
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,720
different agents and different heavy

545
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,720
metals different pesticides different

546
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,720
radiations varieties of radiation

547
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
different um you know

548
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,960
nanotechnology and everything else even

549
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,400
though that's all there there's

550
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
chemicals falling out of the sky even

551
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,840
though that's all

552
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,559
there there has to be two things that's

553
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,720
one thing that's one group that's one

554
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,600
thing but you have to have something

555
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,640
else you have to have a virus you have

556
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:14,120
to have a viral nature inside the body

557
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,000
it has to be a virus inside the body or

558
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,799
viruses inside the body so there are two

559
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,120
things someone has to have in order to

560
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:27,279
create cancer two things they have to

561
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,240
have chemical agent of some kind which

562
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:34,400
is a toxic of some kind and they have to

563
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,520
have a virus that's the two things and

564
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,400
then you got the possibility of possible

565
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,159
cancer you know and if you know unless

566
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,520
you do things like get toxins out of the

567
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,440
body unless you do things like knock any

568
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,960
viruses down then you then you never get

569
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,120
cancer even if you have the virus and

570
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,120
the toxins if but if they get out of

571
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,520
control more tox toxins accumulate more

572
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,240
toxins build up more toxins you know

573
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,720
pile on top of it of itself and build up

574
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,039
in different organs different places of

575
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,159
the body and the brain and the and even

576
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,440
the stomach stomach holds so many toxins

577
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,279
it goes into the lining of the stomach

578
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,039
wherever these toxins are liver

579
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,720
everywhere pancreas you name it and then

580
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,919
the virus the virus is is is increasing

581
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,080
in numbers if it's proliferating if it's

582
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,840
growing and that's the other factor it's

583
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,840
these two

584
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,159
things and that's the difference of what

585
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,760
you're going to hear there's another

586
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,679
difference all in its own so there has

587
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,720
to be a toxin there has to be a virus

588
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,600
the variations are endless though to

589
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,559
what virus and what virus

590
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,320
strain the variations are endless to

591
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,320
what virus and what virus strain and is

592
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,200
the virus mutated what kind of virus is

593
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,880
it

594
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,399
mutated and how many toxins someone has

595
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,279
do they just have a few heavy metals and

596
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:53,320
a little bit of radiation do they have

597
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,159
different varieties of of of you know do

598
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,720
they have all kinds of different

599
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,360
things did they have you know carpet

600
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,360
chemicals you know going through their

601
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,640
body you know from from carpet cleaning

602
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,480
services are they getting their home

603
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,720
sprayed are they eating only

604
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:13,760
conventional produce Non-Stop and only

605
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,520
that but if that if someone H has to be

606
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,480
forced to eat conventional produce

607
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,559
non-stop I understand you know it's more

608
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
affordable in so many ways for so many

609
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,440
people but there's things you could do

610
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
to still clean up the pesticides while

611
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,120
you have to eat that way and you're

612
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,799
still getting benefits from those Foods

613
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,080
that help counter that but the bottom

614
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,159
line is and what I'm trying to say is

615
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,679
the endless variations and then how

616
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:43,240
strong the person's immune system is so

617
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,360
how strong the person's immune system is

618
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:49,640
matters too that makes a huge difference

619
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:53,399
so each person is different everybody's

620
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,360
different okay everybody's different

621
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,840
someone can smoke

622
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,000
cigarettes for 50 years and not develop

623
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,159
lung

624
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,679
cancer someone could never smoke

625
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,399
ever but they happen to breathe in a lot

626
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,760
of hairspray over the years over the

627
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:14,520
decades you know to try to get their

628
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,880
hair looking prettier a certain way so

629
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,799
they just spray and

630
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,760
hairspray and someone breathe in

631
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,200
Hairspray and for some reason they get

632
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,640
lung cancer someone not spraying

633
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,279
anything gets lung cancer and didn't

634
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,720
smoke a day in their life

635
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,840
life I mean I've seen people smoke a

636
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,840
lifetime not get lung cancer and not get

637
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,200
any cancer any cancer because one of

638
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,480
those things that I talked about the two

639
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,440
things one of those things wasn't

640
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,399
there it wasn't there apparently they

641
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,399
had the they had the toxins they were

642
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:54,039
able to smoke for 50 years 60 years 70

643
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,600
years they had the

644
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,240
toxins that's the one thing remember and

645
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,039
the other thing

646
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,480
the viruses they didn't have they didn't

647
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,799
have the viruses they didn't have a

648
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,200
virus that's why old man Johnson never

649
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,000
got lung cancer and never

650
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,159
died that's why old lady McFarland she

651
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,720
never died she she

652
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:23,000
smoked maybe she got a little something

653
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,000
else maybe she got COPD when she's

654
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:29,000
92 but but the Cancer's not there and

655
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,120
I've seen that I mean I've seen that for

656
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,559
decades

657
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,200
happen because there has to be two

658
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,559
things there has to be two things and

659
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,399
the variations matter including even

660
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,880
stress including stress because

661
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,440
adrenaline doesn't help either

662
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,320
adrenaline can be really noxious can be

663
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,880
really

664
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,320
toxic and really difficult to deal with

665
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,159
cancer research like I said is based on

666
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,519
cancer that's manifested already it's it

667
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,440
that's what it's really based on

668
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,320
it it it always has been it's about okay

669
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,279
that's it there it is let's biopsy it

670
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,000
let's cut it out you know let's do what

671
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,960
we got to do I mean whatever I'm not

672
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,679
saying that that's bad or good everybody

673
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,519
has um choices they make and directions

674
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,600
they go to how they handle a situation

675
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,200
and how they deal with it and some

676
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,240
people you know they get surgery some

677
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,600
people don't some people get chemo some

678
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,000
people just get radiation there's a

679
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,960
whole vast differences to how many

680
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,840
people in what they do and can't clinics

681
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,120
have gotten a lot better they have

682
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,000
gotten a lot better it's not like the

683
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,880
Dark Ages you know and and that's true

684
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,519
they have improved in so many different

685
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,559
ways they've reduced and lowered

686
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,240
variations of chemotherapy they're

687
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,960
working on targeting targeting what

688
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,720
chemotherapy works with what cells and

689
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,360
so forth and so there is there's there's

690
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,279
definitely differences that have made a

691
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,519
difference in people's lives and and and

692
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,880
I stand behind science and research 100%

693
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,559
you need to know that one of the things

694
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880
that happens is when I talk about how

695
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,720
science research hasn't discovered this

696
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,159
or they don't understand this or maybe

697
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,320
something Trinkle on down the line

698
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,960
that's not in your best interest it

699
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,960
doesn't mean I don't believe or love

700
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,519
medical research and Science and I don't

701
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
stand behind it and love the people

702
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,080
behind it and what they're doing you

703
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,640
need to know that it's important but but

704
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,760
you also need to know the other side or

705
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,120
the piece pieces of it to fill in

706
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:24,640
so you know with the pesticides and the

707
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,799
herbicides and everything else we have

708
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,080
going on and not just that the different

709
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,159
metal and all the different toxins and

710
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,679
the

711
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,120
solvents that's one aspect of it and

712
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,679
then you have to have the viral present

713
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,480
that's act that's the other side of it

714
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,240
now why why will that create cancer so

715
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,559
back to this why will that create cancer

716
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,840
because the virus has to have something

717
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,279
to feed on it has to have a fuel it has

718
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,679
to have something it can

719
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:58,360
eat something that it can

720
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,720
consume and you might be a a biologist

721
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,360
or something right now listening and

722
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,279
you're like viruses don't eat anything

723
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,960
no that's not true that's misinformation

724
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,720
they even teach in

725
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:13,279
school viruses eat that's how they

726
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,039
produce they eat they can't produce if

727
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,880
they don't get the food they need and if

728
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,279
you don't have a virus in you then you

729
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,279
don't have to

730
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,880
worry I mean but chemicals and harmful

731
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,200
substances don't do us any good and

732
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,760
could give us other health conditions

733
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,080
and problems and cause all kinds of

734
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,240
variations like tumors that are benign

735
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,760
like the tumors back in the day in 400

736
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,320
BC when the word cancer was created and

737
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,919
it was a benign tumor it wasn't

738
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,200
cancerous cells that we deal with today

739
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,919
because that's a new thing new thing in

740
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,039
history but the but but the benign

741
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:51,679
tumors back in 400 BC were filled with

742
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,559
heavy metals especially back in the day

743
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,360
in the Rome day in the Greek you know

744
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:59,240
all that that day back that time in

745
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,320
history and Greece all that time in

746
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,760
history what was going on there was

747
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,720
heavy metals were saturating the

748
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,919
waterways everybody was using heavy

749
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,279
metals like never before in history and

750
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,559
there were some toxic substances for

751
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,360
certain varieties of of minerals and and

752
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,120
chemistry starting nothing like it did

753
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,440
in the dustrial revolution but it

754
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,760
created toxic problems such as tumors

755
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,240
that weren't

756
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,440
cancerous and those tumors have to feed

757
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,960
too but cancer cells need they need the

758
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,200
very toxins I was talking about before

759
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:36,799
they need those toxins in order to

760
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,159
survive in order to eat in order to turn

761
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,519
into something in order to turn into

762
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,000
something a virus cell a viral cell is

763
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,840
not a cancer

764
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,840
cell it's not a cancer

765
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:55,960
cell nope not yet it's not a cancer cell

766
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,799
so a virus cell has to eat and what it

767
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,120
does if it's eating a poison it has to

768
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,480
eliminate it and this is where we're

769
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,760
going to go into more information so

770
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,440
fasten your seat bels again I know I

771
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,519
probably drive you crazy guys with that

772
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,080
one but you know get ready get your you

773
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,240
know get your herbal tea out whatever

774
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,240
you need and the whole bit it's

775
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:20,360
important CU we're going in we're going

776
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:23,679
into some good stuff here um so a virus

777
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,799
consumes a toxin a solvent a pesticide a

778
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,720
heavy metal a plastic a feran a dioxin

779
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:34,760
DI dioxins dioxin the age of dioxins is

780
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:38,399
upon us that's one of virus's favorite

781
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,399
foods for cancer producing a dioxin

782
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,799
itself doesn't

783
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,000
necessarily create cancer if you

784
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,440
saturate a rat in the lab with

785
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,519
dioxins the rat will have viruses

786
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,320
there's there's no question the rat will

787
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,600
have viruses within it to feed off the

788
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,639
dioxin to create a

789
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,039
cancer so and I mean pesticides like DDT

790
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,880
too all those are still in our

791
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:03,720
environment I talk about that so many

792
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,159
times and if you you know I can't cover

793
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,880
everything right now I'd love to talk

794
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,760
about DDT for an hour I can't you just

795
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,240
have to keep on looking into all my past

796
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,279
shows and things I do but but what

797
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,760
happens is once that virus consumes a

798
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,600
toxin it remanufactures it's a

799
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,240
remanufacturing indust industrial

800
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:28,799
machine itself is that tiny viral

801
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,279
cell and it remanu factures the toxin it

802
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,080
changes the chemical

803
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,519
compounds of the chemical structure the

804
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,760
biochemical turns it into a biohazard

805
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:42,360
worse than it was originally turns it

806
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,600
into a biohazard in a worse

807
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,080
State okay than it originally was to

808
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,639
begin with and then it releases it into

809
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,679
the body's

810
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:54,039
atmosphere as something far greater in

811
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,960
strength and

812
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,880
destructive okay far more aggressive to

813
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,480
to the

814
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:04,440
body this new toxin saturates an area of

815
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,879
tissue especially if a virus happens to

816
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:12,520
be near an area of tissue such as say if

817
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,440
a virus is near or in the

818
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,919
thyroid so as it's eating the food it

819
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,040
wants it releases it so that would be a

820
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,560
thyroid

821
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:28,159
cancer so as it releases the

822
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:33,079
toxin in an area a tissue or or um you

823
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:39,000
know an organ more cells

824
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:41,040
die around it from from that toxin

825
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,960
because the cells are being poisoned so

826
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,280
when the virus

827
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,320
remanufactures and it releases that

828
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,440
toxin into tissue and this information

829
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,079
isn't out there this this is a big part

830
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,520
of the information that's not out there

831
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,720
and it's important for you to know write

832
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,440
down your notes cuz I don't want you

833
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,839
forgetting and I don't want you missing

834
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,040
out and once that that that toxic

835
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:09,320
remanufactured Poison's released back

836
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,760
into an organ or into some tissue and

837
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,599
not just floating around the body if

838
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,280
it's close to an organ or anything like

839
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,480
that more cells die in that tissue they

840
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,760
die of a stink of

841
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,200
death basically what that means is is

842
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:29,760
that virus's poison kills cells it kills

843
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,440
cells those cells actually are dying

844
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,240
differently than when cells naturally

845
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,040
die and create toxins so as cells

846
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,920
naturally die and create toxins in our

847
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,800
body on a healthy level that's different

848
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,079
these cells were poisoned to death they

849
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,960
were living cells and now they're poison

850
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,000
to

851
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,720
death and there's a decaying process and

852
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,040
they're very

853
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,800
toxic okay and then that that can even

854
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,520
be released throughout the

855
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,800
bloodstream which lowers the immune

856
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,640
system and the immune function which is

857
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,200
part of all this and a lot of these

858
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,280
rotting cells can also stay in that

859
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,640
adjacent area with whether it's in a

860
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:14,000
thyroid in an organ or

861
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,839
anything but these cells have a

862
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,359
signature attached to them now they have

863
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:20,839
a

864
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:23,040
signature because of the poison that it

865
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:26,040
was that from the virus the virus put a

866
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,040
chemical compound on these Po in these

867
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,480
poisons

868
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,359
and so there's a

869
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:37,319
signature these dying decaying cells

870
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:41,520
prompt an additional viral response so

871
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:42,319
more viruses are coming more viral cells

872
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,400
are

873
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,520
coming and when they come these viral

874
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,440
cells they engage in an area where the

875
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,079
first viral attack was for instance say

876
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,240
on a

877
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,720
thyroid so they engage in that area

878
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,280
where these first cells were done

879
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,319
dying the viruses then consume more

880
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,880
damage dying cells that were first

881
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,119
contaminated

882
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,319
originally and they

883
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:12,280
remanufacture the toxic dead cell

884
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:14,680
material okay now we're remanufacturing

885
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,480
again we're remanufacturing something

886
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,760
that was

887
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,680
remanufactured the poison initially that

888
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,520
got into the cells that killed it was

889
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,640
already remanufactured once this is an

890
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,599
important very important understanding

891
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,920
but when the virus starts to eat those

892
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,720
dead decaying cells that have the once

893
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,640
already remanufactured

894
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,560
poison the virus remanufactures the

895
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,800
poison again the living virus cell

896
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,760
remanufactures the poison again that's

897
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,040
what it does I'm going to tell you

898
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,040
that's not good so it remanufactures

899
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,000
those toxic dead cells this is a process

900
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,599
that doubles the toxic strength it

901
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,599
doubles the toxin

902
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,680
strength

903
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,200
so as the new viruses digest and release

904
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,800
the remman once again remanufactured

905
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,920
poison again it's in double strength

906
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,680
double trouble it's in double strength

907
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,000
double in strength it's synthesized like

908
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,440
a little chemical Factory

909
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
synthesized and just give you an example

910
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,599
of of when you when you take chemicals

911
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,640
in their basic structure structures you

912
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,000
mix them you you spin them you spin them

913
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,760
in the big Vats in the chemical

914
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,880
companies I won't name the companies but

915
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,200
you spin them you work them and you you

916
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,960
do the whole process and then you take

917
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,400
that you take a portion of that not all

918
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,119
of it you take a little portion and you

919
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,839
add it to another batch and you do this

920
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,079
whole mixing and every this whole thing

921
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,520
occurs it's almost like each vat of

922
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,480
chemicals gobbles up a small amount they

923
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,880
keep on passing on to the next one and

924
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,200
it gobbles it up then they take a

925
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,760
portion of that it's called reverse

926
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,920
Homeopathy in a way reverse Homeopathy

927
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,000
for destructive Natures not for healing

928
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,079
the body but for building destructive

929
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Warfare chemicals and so forth and and

930
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,240
insecticides and skull and crossbones

931
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,200
crap you name it it's that so this is

932
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,040
kind of like that that's an example it's

933
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,200
similar in some

934
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,040
way

935
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,400
so basically it's like I'm saying it's

936
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,599
similar to the chemical factors

937
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,400
factories creating more more potent

938
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,240
versions of a chemical compound

939
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,560
synthesizing now if this process

940
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,240
continues the

941
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,119
poison gets stronger and stronger it can

942
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,960
quadruple in strength

943
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,760
and then get even stronger and don't get

944
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,640
scared don't get worried this isn't a

945
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,920
this isn't a scary show this show is a

946
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,839
powerful show to give you an

947
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,680
understanding you never had before so

948
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:40,280
you can do something about it and really

949
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,839
protect yourself like really protect

950
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,520
yourself not just stupid protecting talk

951
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:48,680
like really protect yourself good stuff

952
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,720
really good stuff is you know it's

953
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,160
important to know all this so the poison

954
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,960
severely

955
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,359
mutates and then what happens is the

956
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,119
viruses start to adapt for that new

957
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,720
poison so the viruses are eating these

958
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:06,400
denatured cells these death these dying

959
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,920
cells that are in a little tissue a

960
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,319
little organ tissue they're they're

961
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,640
eating these cells that have already

962
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,480
been remanufactured even once or

963
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,920
twice and they're eating these

964
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,760
cells and the viruses themselves can't

965
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,480
even handle the level of toxin they

966
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:27,880
created to begin with the virus can't

967
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,560
even handle the level of toxin that it

968
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,280
had created it's too much for the virus

969
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,400
itself the original virus that started

970
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,560
out it's way too much and you're hearing

971
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,119
for the first time in history anywhere

972
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,440
right here how how a virus mutates cuz

973
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,359
no one else will tell you cuz they don't

974
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,680
know there's no lab there's no chemical

975
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,440
La chemistry lab there's no biology

976
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,079
place there's no you know immune expert

977
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,520
out there that knows it it doesn't exist

978
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,240
I'm just letting you know I'm not trying

979
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,760
to do that to be cocky sounding and

980
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,040
eggomatic that's not it at all it's

981
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,160
because if I don't don't give you the

982
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,960
point and you just probably think this

983
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,319
stuff's online somewhere and you go out

984
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,640
looking around and you to find some

985
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,640
other interesting little tidbit of

986
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,319
information and you just lose lose you

987
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,280
know you lose

988
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:17,280
this that's why I say what I say

989
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:20,119
so the deal is the virus itself gets

990
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,440
poisoned in order to not let the virus

991
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,520
die which a few of them end up dying

992
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,079
from that noxious poison from that toxic

993
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,640
poison a few few of them do die viruses

994
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,000
and you say hey that's great that's

995
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,240
perfect in that situation it's not

996
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,560
perfect because the virus is quickly

997
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,520
adapt a virus quickly adapts it has to

998
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,280
adapt and in order to adapt it has to

999
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,200
mutate it has to

1000
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:47,680
mutate that's what the virus has to do

1001
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,880
has to change gears has to change gears

1002
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,760
fast because

1003
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,400
viruses the majority of all viruses

1004
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,440
don't want you really getting hurt in

1005
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,240
the end they want to live forever and

1006
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,720
live free and live happy they don't want

1007
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,280
to hurt you in the end just like the

1008
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,839
retrovirus HIV retrovirus it it's never

1009
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,640
there to kill anybody retroviruses don't

1010
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,280
kill anybody it's other things that kill

1011
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,800
people that's what happened with the

1012
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,160
whole AIDS epidemic all all long all

1013
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,880
along people aren't dying anymore of

1014
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,000
AIDS because of new AIDS drugs people

1015
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,520
aren't dying anymore of AIDS because the

1016
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,520
fear of of God and the fear of dying and

1017
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,520
all that's been been dropped back

1018
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,599
because because and that's a big part of

1019
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,839
why people died so much as they thought

1020
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,880
they had a death sentence that would

1021
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,839
kill them in two days because that's

1022
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,760
that's how it was purported out there

1023
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,800
misinformation it hurt so many

1024
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,880
people but retroviruses and all viruses

1025
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,559
they just not all viruses I'm sorry

1026
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,440
viruses that are more just stealth more

1027
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,720
natural-based um they have a lineage in

1028
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,640
our history so the vir you know a virus

1029
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,880
can get this poison in its system get

1030
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,720
this poisonous system and die but but

1031
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,880
but the viruses quickly learn from

1032
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,000
another virus that died it quickly

1033
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,760
learns and so it actually

1034
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,240
adapts and once it adapts it can handle

1035
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,040
a higher level a level you know six a

1036
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:18,400
level you know

1037
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,599
higher of poison so as it eating the

1038
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,839
dead cells the human cells our cells as

1039
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:24,400
it's eating the dead cells out of a out

1040
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,200
of some tissue out of some connective

1041
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,640
tissue out of an organ out of the liver

1042
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,079
out of the lung wherever cancers go and

1043
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,359
wherever cancers start and all these

1044
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,720
different things it's eating all this

1045
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,680
and get that dead cells it's

1046
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,680
remanufacturing once again and it's

1047
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,800
getting stronger and that stronger

1048
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,079
material kills a few more viral cells

1049
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,839
that come along and try to

1050
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,960
engage and then more adapting occurs and

1051
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,280
more mutating of viruses have to amp up

1052
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,040
and the viruses

1053
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,720
become a different type of virus and not

1054
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,640
a virus that can make you feel super

1055
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,760
duper for sick necessarily viruses you

1056
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,000
don't even feel you're not feeling

1057
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,359
anything going on you're barely feeling

1058
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
anything there's nothing even going on

1059
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:08,960
you're just living your life all is

1060
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,480
good

1061
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,079
so so basically that adapting

1062
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,839
occurs and the virus has to become

1063
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,119
something different So eventually the

1064
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:25,559
virus goes to another stage where it

1065
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:27,040
mutates so destructively or so

1066
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:28,920
differently

1067
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,800
because of the level of toxins that were

1068
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,559
constantly remanufactured over and over

1069
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,480
and over

1070
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:39,079
again it had to change its game to the

1071
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,559
point where that Viral cell became now a

1072
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,240
cancer cell the viral cell is a cancer

1073
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,839
cell that's when it became a cancer cell

1074
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,440
and nowhere in medical history do they

1075
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,520
know this part yet they know that

1076
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,480
viruses could be a cancer cell they know

1077
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,079
that some viruses create cancers they

1078
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,559
finally know that now guess what I knew

1079
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,240
that as a child I got that information

1080
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,160
from my source as a child before it was

1081
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,160
even out

1082
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,640
there but they know that now but they

1083
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:12,520
don't know the process of how it gets

1084
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,720
there and the reason why they're not

1085
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,800
going

1086
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:21,200
to is because that virus isn't your

1087
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,359
fault that you have it if you do if if

1088
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,000
like they say 50% of the of the world's

1089
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,440
population is going to have cancer in 20

1090
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,880
years

1091
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,640
versus you know the other 50% not having

1092
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,680
if the rates are going to be that high

1093
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,440
it's not your

1094
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:38,079
fault that you have that virus and it's

1095
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,440
not your fault you have those chemicals

1096
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,079
those chemical compounds those

1097
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,520
destructive compounds those toxins it's

1098
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,240
not your fault it's somebody else's

1099
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:50,720
fault believe it or not and it points

1100
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,359
back to the

1101
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,160
industries and if it gets out that none

1102
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,839
of this cancer was your fault at all and

1103
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,359
someone else is fallen and he gets out

1104
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,800
there then there's hell to pay and

1105
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,800
there's trillions and trillions and

1106
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,079
trillions of dollars in Damages look at

1107
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:10,000
it ASB bestus cancer misilo look at ASB

1108
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:13,720
bestus cancer okay they got a $30

1109
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,520
billion fund sitting out there for just

1110
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,839
one cancer an industrial cancer asbest

1111
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,359
by the way

1112
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:24,599
asbest es bestus doesn't need a virus

1113
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:27,280
that's why I didn't add it to all the

1114
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,359
toxins and all the the the poisons I

1115
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,280
talked about it doesn't need a virus

1116
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:38,000
aestus on its own can create an aestus

1117
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,200
cancer it's literally its own breed its

1118
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,200
own breed completely separate from 99%

1119
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,599
of all the other cancers which guess

1120
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:52,559
what are viral cancers 99% of all the

1121
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:56,200
cancers out there are viral cancers you

1122
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,760
guys except for asbestos cancer but look

1123
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,280
there's a$ 30 30 m billion sorry $ 30

1124
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,720
billion

1125
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:06,839
fund for people who've been afflicted by

1126
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:09,079
asbestos cancer right right well because

1127
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:13,599
it was somebody's

1128
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:16,040
fault but if we were told that it took a

1129
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,400
virus and it took all these different

1130
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,160
host of chemicals right down since the

1131
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,880
industrial re Revolution the

1132
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,359
corporations and the industries and

1133
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,880
everything else going back since 1799

1134
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:29,800
since 1817 the birth of the industrial

1135
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,319
re Revolution would have to come up with

1136
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,520
funds of billions and billions of

1137
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,319
dollars it would equal trillions and

1138
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,119
trillions and especially since it's

1139
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,400
going to carry on for decades and

1140
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,280
decades and decades and more people are

1141
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,640
going to get cancer and sick of can sick

1142
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,640
with cancer and die and all these other

1143
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,720
things that suffer with every in the

1144
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,960
future unless they learn information and

1145
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:52,000
protect themselves really and watch the

1146
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,880
back and because more and more that's

1147
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,839
going to happen it wouldn't just be some

1148
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,319
asbest fund of 30 billion

1149
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:03,319
it would be in the trillions higher than

1150
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:05,520
the country's country's debt of 20

1151
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:07,599
trillion do that we have now which is

1152
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,880
the country's debt it would be higher

1153
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,920
than

1154
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,599
1920 trillion do can you believe that

1155
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,400
yes it would be higher than that so it

1156
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,800
has to be your fault it has to be your

1157
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,119
fault something that is in your jeans

1158
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,760
cuz you got bad

1159
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,559
jeans jeans play a role in a lot of

1160
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,880
different things don't get me wrong but

1161
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,680
it's not why someone gets cancer that's

1162
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,079
why the Brock 1 Brock two Gene with

1163
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,480
breast cancer that's why the majority of

1164
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,119
women with breast breast cancer don't

1165
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,200
have the Brock one or Brock two Gene but

1166
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,200
what happened is the misinformation has

1167
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,680
to get out there they have to feed it to

1168
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,119
people because if you know the truth

1169
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,000
someone's going to take the blame down

1170
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:50,319
the road someone's going to find out how

1171
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,359
the first Epstein bars and the first hhv

1172
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:55,240
6es and the first different viruses

1173
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:57,400
started back in the early 1900s and who

1174
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,720
started in where someone's going to find

1175
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,799
out another $5 trillion right there a

1176
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,119
payback someone's going to find out I

1177
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:05,160
saw the chemical companies which

1178
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,440
chemicals and everything else that's why

1179
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,960
you can't really get a straight anything

1180
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,559
out of anybody so they do it General

1181
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,200
dioxin they Compass it into one package

1182
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:16,799
so no one gets the blame no one takes

1183
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,160
the blame you say oh dioxins could

1184
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:22,599
create cancer it kind of do on a rat so

1185
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,520
you know but that's about as far as it

1186
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:26,520
goes

1187
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,400
so

1188
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,040
let's let's let's keep on going let's

1189
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,319
keep on

1190
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,200
going so here's the annoying part the

1191
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:38,920
cancer

1192
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:42,000
virus can do something it can create a c

1193
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,720
meaning now now a cancer cell so the

1194
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,760
virus can create a cancer

1195
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,200
cell all

1196
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,720
right and when it does this here's

1197
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,480
here's what's annoying it releases a

1198
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:57,880
chemical out of it a chemical that

1199
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,680
saturates the human cell in the adjacent

1200
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:03,319
area that was poisoned originally with

1201
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:06,079
remanufactured toxins over and over

1202
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:09,119
again so it can actually deliver now a

1203
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,960
chemical a biochemical it can the cell

1204
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:16,680
can produce a chemical and shoot it out

1205
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,839
into adjacent human cells in a tissue in

1206
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,520
an organ in an adjacent area and it can

1207
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,920
do

1208
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:29,319
this and turn a human cell into a cancer

1209
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,559
cell and that human cell is going to be

1210
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:33,280
different than the viral cancer cell and

1211
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:36,520
this is something science of research

1212
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,640
has not discovered there's a subtle and

1213
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:43,119
critical difference in every

1214
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:47,079
tumor and every lesion a cancerous

1215
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:50,839
lesion in in any bone cancer there's a

1216
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:53,000
subtle difference there's viral cells

1217
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:56,400
that literally pose identically as the

1218
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,280
human cell cancer so there's a cancer

1219
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,640
viral cell and a human cancer cell that

1220
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,319
pose identically to each other because

1221
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,400
science hasn't been able to divide them

1222
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:06,640
yet they haven't been able to open up a

1223
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,599
tumor and know which one's which and

1224
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,559
know which one's which haven't gotten

1225
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,799
there yet that's another 20 30 years

1226
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:19,079
from

1227
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:23,559
now but that's what happens right there

1228
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:26,839
so a human cell turns into a cancer

1229
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:29,720
cell and the cancer cell the the the

1230
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:31,960
virus turns into a cancer cell first

1231
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,680
obviously and so it creates a human

1232
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:38,119
cancer cell and they communicate and

1233
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,000
they start to share the foods they like

1234
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,559
they sh they start to share

1235
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,119
communication for what that cancer likes

1236
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,200
to eat yeah what that cancer likes to

1237
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,559
eat which we're going into a whole bunch

1238
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:54,599
of other stuff so I hope you're enjoying

1239
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:57,480
this this ride um you know and you're

1240
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:59,160
not upset or anything else just you know

1241
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,400
just maybe some like I said lemon balm

1242
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,559
tea is one of my favorites because why

1243
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,839
it's one of the most powerful

1244
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:09,640
anti-cancerous teas that I love so so I

1245
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:12,079
love the lemon balm but Peppermint's

1246
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,359
good too just to you know relax overall

1247
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,599
as well Chom meal is okay so whatever

1248
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,880
you got in your cupboard let's do it so

1249
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,079
let's go back into this let's go back

1250
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:26,040
into the different factors and

1251
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:30,640
everything else so as more cells gather

1252
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:32,920
in tissue and and they they can actually

1253
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,480
poison more cells so we need that before

1254
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,520
multiplying occurs we need a poisoning

1255
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,040
to occur so the virus is poisoning more

1256
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,680
good cells they're dying it's

1257
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,599
remanufacturing again it's

1258
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,280
remanufacturing stronger and stronger

1259
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,760
like I said before the human cells are

1260
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:55,319
dying turning into cancer

1261
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,920
cells but multiplying has not occurred

1262
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:59,400
and this is why people may just have a

1263
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,240
lesion you know a really bad lesion on a

1264
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,799
liver doctors don't know if it's good

1265
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,240
bad cancer or not unless they do a

1266
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:06,119
biopsy and some many times they're still

1267
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,040
not even sure to be

1268
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:11,680
honest

1269
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:12,799
and so as this is occurring so this can

1270
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,160
also create a whole bunch of different

1271
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:15,960
carcinomas there's not just one

1272
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,640
carcinoma obviously it's a really

1273
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,200
popular cancer and there's different

1274
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:22,319
varieties of mutated forms of carcinoma

1275
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,000
and it can and remember variations

1276
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,880
matter with all the different poisons

1277
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,839
what poisons were involved was it old

1278
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:30,640
DDT was it a pesticide was it herbicide

1279
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:33,480
was it a fungicide from buying new

1280
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,680
clothes at the shopping Mark was it uh

1281
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,640
was it anything was it detergents was it

1282
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,319
was it conventional detergents I won't

1283
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,920
may name the names but all those

1284
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:44,119
conventional deter detergents you know

1285
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,359
you see commercials for that easily

1286
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:48,280
could spawn on and feed a virus and and

1287
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:50,280
create a Cancer all these different

1288
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:55,200
toxins and chemical warfare that we're

1289
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:58,160
up against so what occurs after a while

1290
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:01,640
is a tumor can start because the cells

1291
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,400
the human cells that are cancerous now

1292
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,760
they're staying alive more than they're

1293
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,079
dying so more than they're dying off

1294
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,720
they're staying alive because cancer

1295
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,799
cells at the beginning can naturally die

1296
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:14,280
off they can naturally die

1297
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:16,559
off they can't just like a virus because

1298
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,160
the virus FedEd

1299
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:23,920
information and so but the reproduction

1300
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:26,280
of the poison is so toxic so dangerous

1301
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,839
that's saturating more and more cells

1302
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,040
and the cells start to accumulate while

1303
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:35,680
alive and mutated and they group

1304
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:37,359
together and they start forming a very

1305
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,119
microscopic

1306
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,760
membrane

1307
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,000
extremely microscopic vessels kind of

1308
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,000
like blood

1309
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,240
vessels really small and it starts to

1310
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,640
connect them all together kind of like

1311
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,400
like kind of like when you go to a tree

1312
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,559
and you saw all the different veins on a

1313
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,440
leaf but more so than this kind of like

1314
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,040
a

1315
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,160
beehive kind of like that too and it

1316
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:06,839
starts to connect with having an ability

1317
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:09,599
to feed itself what it needs feed itself

1318
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:12,240
the poison it needs feed itself the food

1319
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,599
it needs to stay

1320
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,400
alive and it so it groups itself but as

1321
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,559
it groups itself it groups itself and

1322
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,160
encapsulates a whole bunch of viruses

1323
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:26,280
too that are also

1324
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,520
mutated they become one

1325
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,400
but what has to grow out of it is

1326
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:34,680
angiogenesis well angiogenesis you know

1327
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:36,839
you know that that's not nothing new

1328
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,599
angiogenesis but I'll tell you something

1329
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,240
new

1330
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:43,079
angiogenesis okay are these different

1331
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,520
blood vessels that are coming out like

1332
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:48,440
tentacles so the tumor can grow and mass

1333
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:52,400
reduce and take it take in more tissue

1334
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:55,039
or even Tak in more cells through

1335
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:00,079
angiogenesis viruses tend to try to

1336
00:55:55,039 --> 00:56:01,520
deliver human cells up the veins of the

1337
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,240
blood vessels the

1338
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,480
androgenesis um viruses start to become

1339
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,960
from the outside of the tumor Delivery

1340
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,319
Systems Delivery Systems and adrenaline

1341
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:12,400
is a big part of this if you're under

1342
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:13,559
too much stress You're Going Through

1343
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,079
Hell all these different things are

1344
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:20,119
going on in your life adrenaline can

1345
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,319
help open up the the the the tentacle

1346
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:24,200
the androgenesis and science has no clue

1347
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,039
about these parts and I want to give you

1348
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:29,000
the four warning on these different

1349
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:32,559
pieces and it helps Drive cells up that

1350
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,160
the that the viruses are bringing up

1351
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:39,760
virus can bring cells up and also

1352
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,240
deliver them up in different ways up

1353
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,760
this these tiny blood

1354
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,000
vessels and the

1355
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,000
adrenaline prompts the blood vessels to

1356
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,119
open up even wider it's why people who

1357
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,640
are under enormous stress and don't take

1358
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,079
care of themselves and have any

1359
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,400
anti-cancerous foods and all these

1360
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,839
different things can

1361
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:01,119
can come down with a

1362
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,839
cancer so as this is happening these

1363
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,760
tentacles and blood vessels are are

1364
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:06,000
reaching out the tumor can grow the

1365
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:10,119
cancer can

1366
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,920
grow but it's going to need more fuel

1367
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:15,200
and more food and that's where that's

1368
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,640
where the important stuff really comes

1369
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,760
in to try to stop cancers try to reverse

1370
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,559
cancers try to prevent Cancers and it's

1371
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,559
foods and how foods

1372
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:26,760
work and

1373
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:28,440
that's where we're going to go into

1374
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,720
we're going to do a little food time is

1375
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,280
everybody ready for that we'll do a

1376
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,319
little food

1377
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,960
time and actually actually before the

1378
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,559
food time let's go into a little bit of

1379
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:42,839
Epstein bar let's go into a little bit

1380
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:45,079
of viral time let's do that now in order

1381
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:47,480
to keep a virus happy technically you

1382
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,559
really have to be feeding foods that

1383
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,880
viruses love that's another factor of it

1384
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,200
so not only do you have chemicals and

1385
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,559
poisons and toxins and all these

1386
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,039
different things that are in your system

1387
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:56,400
that you can get from all all these

1388
00:57:55,039 --> 00:58:00,079
different solvents and every all the

1389
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,680
exposure I talked about but you can also

1390
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,760
be eating all the wrong foods and

1391
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,319
viruses love the wrong Foods now if you

1392
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,280
feed the vir if you don't Fe feed the

1393
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,880
viruses the wrong Foods anymore and you

1394
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,440
just have the toxins you might not get

1395
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,880
cancer you might even be able to stop it

1396
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,880
it's the food component that falls into

1397
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,359
the whole thing too the real bad foods

1398
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,839
that actually falls into it but Epstein

1399
00:58:20,359 --> 00:58:25,680
bar which doesn't really which is really

1400
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,400
somewhat of a doile virus and it's not

1401
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,440
really supposed to create cancer as

1402
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,559
anything it gets fed all the things it

1403
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,240
wants and you know it there's different

1404
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:34,880
strains of Epstein bar I talk about it

1405
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,280
in you know all the time you guys you

1406
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,960
know you know you've heard all my

1407
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,160
different shows I won't go deep into it

1408
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,799
but he talk about the 60 different

1409
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,680
varieties that I've found um over the

1410
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:47,599
years nobody knows about different

1411
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:50,599
mutated varieties I mean I remember just

1412
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,480
seven years ago uh talking to a chemist

1413
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:55,280
and and and a biologist and an

1414
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,720
immunologist talk talking to all three

1415
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,720
of them because it was about a patient

1416
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,119
and I was explaining about um about

1417
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:05,440
their patient and my client and I was

1418
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,200
talking about you know the the different

1419
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,520
variety of the mutations of Epstein B

1420
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,280
and they and they they couldn't even

1421
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,760
believe it now you know some guys just

1422
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,839
like yeah you know what I believe that

1423
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,599
viruses probably do mutate and it's it's

1424
00:59:14,839 --> 00:59:18,680
it's actually for some reason people can

1425
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,920
digest it better now it's amazing how

1426
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:23,160
time has to go by it's sad it's really

1427
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,039
sad though that it has to go by like

1428
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:29,359
that so what happens is you got the you

1429
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,799
got the uh you got the virus cells virus

1430
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:36,920
cells viral cancer cells tend to also

1431
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:39,280
teach the human cancer cells what to eat

1432
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,680
like I was talking about what to like

1433
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,319
and that's why a tumor can grow bigger

1434
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,960
and bigger if it has a lot of mutated

1435
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:48,520
human cells in that tumor it'll start

1436
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,400
getting an appetite of what that virus

1437
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:53,640
likes like for instance an Epstein bar

1438
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:56,119
loves dairy products and loves

1439
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,319
eggs and it loves all these different

1440
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:59,440
foods we're going to cover in a little

1441
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:01,960
bit but let's talk about Epstein bar

1442
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,119
cancers carcinoma it's all Epstein bar

1443
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,200
cancer every carcinoma is Epstein bar

1444
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,760
it's a variety of Epstein bar that's

1445
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,880
been mutated and can create

1446
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,079
cancer and that's all the carcinomas now

1447
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,400
if you have epine bar you don't have to

1448
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,240
worry it's not about you're going to get

1449
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,640
cancer or not no so you can do things so

1450
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,280
that you don't get cancer you can do

1451
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,440
things so you can stop cancers you can

1452
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,319
do things and that's what this

1453
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,240
information is about Epstein B

1454
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:29,520
is literally responsible for all the

1455
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,720
carcinomas it's responsible for every

1456
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:34,760
prostate

1457
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:36,520
cancer it's responsible for every

1458
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,039
leukemia some

1459
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:41,400
leukemias have heavy metals behind them

1460
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:44,119
but you need the virus remember what I

1461
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:46,760
talked about before you have to have a

1462
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:48,880
toxin and you have to have a

1463
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:52,480
virus all the

1464
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:56,559
leukemias are Epstein bar children's

1465
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,599
leukemia Epstein bar with heavy metal

1466
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,520
preferably

1467
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:04,640
Mercury and um it's all the prostate

1468
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,400
cancers all the breast cancers I repeat

1469
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,119
all the breast cancers Epstein bar I've

1470
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,599
been saying that forever and now it's

1471
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:12,319
information that's finally starting to

1472
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,599
take that information just starting to

1473
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,680
surface but I promise you I've been

1474
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,520
saying that forever I'll go all the way

1475
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:22,559
back in time on that one um I was the

1476
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,440
first one to say that the first one I

1477
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,359
believe um and I say that

1478
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,000
because it's important to know the

1479
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,760
information and and the differences and

1480
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,200
everything else breast cancer Epstein

1481
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:38,119
bar 100% lung cancers most lung cancers

1482
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,359
are Epstein barus lung cancer no it's

1483
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:42,079
not Epstein

1484
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:44,720
bar that's what I talked about before

1485
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:48,160
thyroid cancer is Epstein

1486
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:52,920
bar all liver

1487
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:55,920
cancers Epstein bar some brain

1488
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:58,839
cancers Epstein

1489
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,440
bar very important to understand so

1490
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:05,960
that's just the tip of the iceberg right

1491
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,680
there tip of the iceberg right now um

1492
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,839
it's starting the word for HPV is

1493
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,119
starting to get out where HPV

1494
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:14,520
creates creates um cervical cancer

1495
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,400
creates it creates different cancers

1496
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:20,720
ovarian cancer creates um and you know

1497
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,559
and that's that's out there now and it's

1498
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:25,039
HPV

1499
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:27,240
but HPV is always

1500
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:29,359
present but it's Epstein bar that

1501
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,359
creates ovarian cancers all the ovarian

1502
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,279
cancers all the cervical cancers all the

1503
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,520
uter uterine cancers that's epine bar

1504
01:02:34,279 --> 01:02:38,839
that creates us cancers it's just that

1505
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,920
the more epine bar you have in the

1506
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,000
reproductive system which a lot of women

1507
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,359
have a lot of epine bar in the

1508
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,839
productive system um the more HPV

1509
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,680
because the immune system is lowered in

1510
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,359
the reproductive system the reproductive

1511
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,520
systems immune system is dropped down so

1512
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:54,640
you can have higher

1513
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,839
HPV if you're killing off HPV by eating

1514
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,359
healthy and doing all these wonderful

1515
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,680
things and everything and you notice HPV

1516
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,160
is going down or a doctor says hey you

1517
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,359
don't have HPV anymore chances are you

1518
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,720
knocked down your Epstein bar at the

1519
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,480
same time and had no

1520
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:09,000
clue and that's how it works

1521
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,039
there um I'm not saying HPV is this

1522
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,279
great friendly virus that causes no harm

1523
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:17,279
at all it can cause Scar

1524
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:18,559
Tissue but that's not the scar tissue

1525
01:03:17,279 --> 01:03:20,640
that's behind the Epstein bar

1526
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,680
reproductive cancers it's this important

1527
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,960
bit of information I'd like to get

1528
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:29,200
across um

1529
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,359
so let's let's let's keep on going we

1530
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,920
got we got some stuff to talk about the

1531
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:36,839
different viruses let's talk about hhv6

1532
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:40,240
real really quick hhv6 creates kidney

1533
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:46,039
cancers that's a human herpes virus

1534
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:49,319
hhv6 all the h7s the eights oh look um

1535
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:51,839
saroma okay that's a herpes virus but

1536
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:53,760
but science research knows that one too

1537
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:57,599
that that's a herpes virus but there's

1538
01:03:53,760 --> 01:04:00,119
also hh9 10 undiscovered 10 undiscovered

1539
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,720
hhv1 undiscovered hv12 I talk about my

1540
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:03,960
herpy show those are all cancer

1541
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,880
promoters cancer creators all the

1542
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:09,119
different mutations of

1543
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,160
hhv6 actually create a lot of different

1544
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:14,760
cancers heart cancers cancers of the

1545
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:18,160
heart cancers of the stomach Epstein bar

1546
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:21,200
can create cancers of the pancreas

1547
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,520
hhv6 K kidney cancer that's one of its

1548
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,960
biggest heart

1549
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,279
cancer um different types of connective

1550
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,720
tissue cancer for hhv6 different brain

1551
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:34,799
cancers for hhv6 and its mutated

1552
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:38,400
forms so it's really the herpes viral

1553
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,599
Family as that unit of all of them from

1554
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,200
cyto magal virus which is kind of doile

1555
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:46,279
but could create a

1556
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:49,400
Cancer and these these the herpes family

1557
01:04:46,279 --> 01:04:51,760
is mostly responsible not entirely most

1558
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,760
responsible being that other piece that

1559
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,000
you need to create cancer along with all

1560
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:00,440
those tox we talked about

1561
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:03,240
before now in order for a tumor to grow

1562
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,000
it needs to draw food it likes so if

1563
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:07,200
you're still living in a toxic situation

1564
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,279
you're getting doused with lots of

1565
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,359
dioxins of different varieties different

1566
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:14,440
kinds Fernand in the air you know

1567
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:15,760
chemical sprays maybe you live someplace

1568
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,119
and they spray all the time try to get

1569
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:20,079
the schedule so you don't get sprayed

1570
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,880
and hit all the different names if you

1571
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,359
want a weed killer you go you get a bug

1572
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,440
spray a wasp killer and you go and get

1573
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:27,960
your can of wasp peel and you're

1574
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,480
spraying it if this keeps on adding up

1575
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,119
along with makeups that aren't

1576
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,160
natural as long as creams that aren't

1577
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,279
natural in certain ways um hair care

1578
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,640
products hair dyes all the different

1579
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:41,520
chemicals and solvents and different

1580
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,520
varities perfumes perfumes are one of

1581
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:47,279
the worst perfume

1582
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:49,720
companies would literally have to Fork

1583
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:52,559
over billions and billions of

1584
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:54,240
dollars if the truth really got out to

1585
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,599
how to separate these chemical compounds

1586
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,279
where they originate from where they get

1587
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,000
them from and how it

1588
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:01,760
works like I said before like I said

1589
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,599
before it wouldn't be an asbest fund of

1590
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,680
you know of 30 billion if you add it all

1591
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:10,720
up it would be way above the country's

1592
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:15,119
um you know the country's debt of 20

1593
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:16,839
trillion so what do these cancers really

1594
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,400
like to eat besides all those poisons I

1595
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:21,160
just mentioned there they need the if a

1596
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,720
cancer becomes a tumor and it's a mix of

1597
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,839
human cells and viral cells it's going

1598
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:27,799
to need the food you're eating it's

1599
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:32,079
going to need the food you're eating

1600
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:33,599
eggs are number one number one on that

1601
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,520
list

1602
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,240
eggs now I look I would love an egg just

1603
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,079
as much as anybody else I talk about

1604
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,240
that so many times people are happy when

1605
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,520
you make them

1606
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,039
eggs and I get it if it's you got

1607
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,960
nothing else to eat and that's all you

1608
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,480
got to eat then we you know work on some

1609
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,480
supplements and I get it you know if

1610
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,920
you're trying to take care of yourself

1611
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,200
and eggs is all you got I get it I'd

1612
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,240
rather have you do something else like

1613
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,960
brown rice over eggs if we could maybe

1614
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,960
get brown rice and I realized that brown

1615
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,079
rice is a grain and some of you are like

1616
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,319
oh he's not ahead of the curve oh here

1617
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,839
we go again he just blew his whole thing

1618
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:12,319
his whole show because he's talking

1619
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:15,000
about grains and uh but but brown rice

1620
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,359
doesn't feed a cancer it won't feed a

1621
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,039
cancer I'm just letting you know

1622
01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:20,079
whatever your belief system is on a

1623
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:21,799
grain that's not the one that feeds

1624
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,520
cancer but I will tell you I will tell

1625
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:27,200
you this that corn does feed cancer and

1626
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,960
that information is correct out there

1627
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,640
been saying that forever GMO corn will

1628
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:34,520
feed cancer without a doubt GMO canola

1629
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,880
oil I wouldn't even I I I would probably

1630
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,079
even steer clar if you're worried about

1631
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,559
cancers or something steer clear from

1632
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,119
them but eggs that's the top of the Heap

1633
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:45,400
right there and that's recommended all

1634
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,160
the time to everyone what every kind of

1635
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,559
illness right now these days eggs it's

1636
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,400
good for you it's got the Omega-3s all

1637
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:55,039
that but no egg material and eggs

1638
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,200
hormones and natural organic eggs

1639
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:00,279
hormone-free eggs still have hormones

1640
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,720
eggs are a ball of natural hormones from

1641
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:03,880
the chicken I'm not talking about

1642
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,960
injected hormones talking about organic

1643
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:10,720
natural hormones and those feed cancers

1644
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:13,000
like nothing else does and they drive

1645
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:15,440
right up the tentacles right up the

1646
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,600
endogenesis right into or right into

1647
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,679
precancer cells which are virus cells

1648
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,719
turning into some kind of cancer right

1649
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,040
in and it drive they just consume it

1650
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,640
they love eggs viruses eggs a whole bit

1651
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,359
it's why you could beat your Epstein bar

1652
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,000
anytime you can kill your Epstein bar

1653
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,040
anytime you just get the V get the

1654
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,480
viruses under control knock them down

1655
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,520
bit right beat him down and talk about

1656
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:40,839
it on the show on the um the upstein bar

1657
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,960
show so so you got to look out for that

1658
01:08:40,839 --> 01:08:47,080
dairy products are another thing that's

1659
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:50,880
number two dairy products milk forget it

1660
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:53,520
goats milk forget it cheese forget it

1661
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,279
okay kefir forget it yogurt forget it

1662
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,759
any anything else I forget cream and

1663
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,600
your coffee forget

1664
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:01,560
it and coffee is not even great you got

1665
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,279
it dealing with a cancer coffee UPS up

1666
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:05,159
the adrenaline gets the adrenaline

1667
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,600
pumping and then if you got cream in

1668
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:08,640
your coffee you could be feeding some

1669
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,679
cells so it's just not even

1670
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,920
good I mean if you're really not worried

1671
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,679
you don't have anything going yeah you

1672
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,520
can enjoy a cup of coffee I guess why

1673
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,679
not but the bottom line is it's the

1674
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,400
foods that I'm talking about get driven

1675
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:23,319
up

1676
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,600
into the tentacles and get into it and

1677
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:28,719
here's another thing that you got to

1678
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:30,960
know about protein protein feeds cancer

1679
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,239
now you're probably getting ready

1680
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,319
getting the stones out and we going to

1681
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:35,880
throw stones now break glass break

1682
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,799
Windows if you need to break windows

1683
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,000
then don't don't do that no if you need

1684
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:42,679
to kick kick something kick something

1685
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:47,759
kick a can kick a can down the

1686
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:50,759
street but protein feeds cancers cancers

1687
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:54,239
learn how to eat protein because here's

1688
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:56,719
why protein doesn't digest so e easily

1689
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,480
in us heavy amounts of protein it

1690
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,800
doesn't digest easy so it doesn't break

1691
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:05,080
down and it gets it gets into the liver

1692
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:08,400
it starts to collect in areas of the

1693
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:11,920
body and it grows toxic and it creates a

1694
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:15,040
toxin so protein undigested denatured

1695
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,440
protein because becomes denatured for a

1696
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:20,800
multitude of reasons and it releases a

1697
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:23,080
chemical chemical that that cancers love

1698
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,320
to feed on so if you're into whoo all

1699
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,000
protein nothing nothing but protein

1700
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:30,199
nothing but protein you're in the wrong

1701
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,480
game you can have some protein and

1702
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:34,480
there's great protein sources quinoa is

1703
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,719
a great protein Source it won't feed a

1704
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:41,199
cancer a black bean is a great protein

1705
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:43,719
Source won't feed a cancer a spinach

1706
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:45,560
spinach leaf great protein Source a few

1707
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:47,800
different kinds of seeds hemp seeds

1708
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,400
incredible protein Source you know I you

1709
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,719
don't need probably a lesson or a

1710
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:55,520
teaching on that there amazing protein

1711
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:58,520
sources potato Believe It or Not doesn't

1712
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:59,520
feed cancer it won't feed cancer but

1713
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,800
you're probably thinking well there's

1714
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,520
sugar in potato sugar feeds cancer no

1715
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:09,080
here's the deal the wrong sugar feeds

1716
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:10,360
cancer and in labs they have proven that

1717
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,920
corn

1718
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:17,080
syrup genetically modified corn syrup

1719
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:20,360
can feed cancer can actually accelerate

1720
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,159
cancer but they have yet proven because

1721
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:27,400
they can't and they never will never

1722
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:30,360
will that fruit and fruit sugar feeds

1723
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:33,880
cancer the reason why is because they'll

1724
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:37,040
never have the sugar and fruit

1725
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,199
accompanied with all of that color the

1726
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,480
antioxidants all the phytochemicals that

1727
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:43,800
stop and kill cancer they'll never have

1728
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,239
the study with that instead they'll

1729
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,719
separate

1730
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:50,520
fructose and still even fructose by

1731
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:52,360
itself won't feed a cancer I don't care

1732
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,440
what botch research and I'm going to go

1733
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,280
back to the very beginning remember this

1734
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,760
here's how studies work so you know how

1735
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:02,040
studies work when someone funds A study

1736
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,360
in medical science both conventional or

1737
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,800
alternative they don't want to know

1738
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:08,440
their money was

1739
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,960
wasted so when somebody has a big idea

1740
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,480
like a belief system so say St there's

1741
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,760
there's a big doctor that has a belief

1742
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,199
system and they want to prove it and

1743
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,199
they get funding they finally get

1744
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,440
funding it's a big break for them and

1745
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,880
they don't want to be

1746
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:24,199
humiliated and they get this huge you

1747
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:27,679
know huge hunk of money to try to

1748
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:29,080
determine if their Theory applies the

1749
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:32,719
people who fund

1750
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,280
it don't want to lose that money that

1751
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,679
person will never be funded again if

1752
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,280
they can't prove what they were trying

1753
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,480
to prove this is how this has been a

1754
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,360
history this is going back in history

1755
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,239
over and over again I'm just telling you

1756
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,920
right now this is the beginning of

1757
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:49,600
medicine so what happens is all right

1758
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:53,719
that the theory will come out one way or

1759
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:55,159
another as being proven but fruit sugar

1760
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:58,280
in a piece of

1761
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:59,400
fruit with all of its biochem all of its

1762
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,360
amazing

1763
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:05,320
phytochemicals to actually stop

1764
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:08,000
cancer that will not feed cancer what

1765
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:12,639
happens is so when you eat plain old

1766
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,600
corn syrup and plain old cane syrup and

1767
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:16,360
you're eating cane syrup and corn syrup

1768
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,840
and you're doing a lot of that and it

1769
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,520
happens to be in chocolate cake and

1770
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,600
other things there's a combination of a

1771
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,639
lot of things that feed a cancer that

1772
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:28,600
can make that corn syrup make that table

1773
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:30,679
sugar feed cancer It's a combination of

1774
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,840
all of the wheat which is a different

1775
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:34,880
grain wheat is a different grain than

1776
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,880
the other grains genetically altered

1777
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,719
wheat combination of that all the canola

1778
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,320
oils maybe the lard maybe the fats

1779
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:45,679
because fats also feed

1780
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:49,639
cancers higher fat diet you're on the

1781
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:52,719
faster a cancer can Thrive because fats

1782
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:55,040
take out the oxygen out of the blood it

1783
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:58,960
reduces the the oxygen out of the blood

1784
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:02,800
oxygen kills cancer kills cancer

1785
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:05,920
cells so when your your oxygen is lower

1786
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,560
than it should be and those tentacles

1787
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,920
are drawing up nutrients and they're

1788
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,040
drawing up nutrients and they're drawing

1789
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:15,000
up less oxygen than ever before because

1790
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,880
you're on a high protein high fat diet

1791
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,840
you got a better chance of not slowing

1792
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:22,639
down a cancer so if your diet is you

1793
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,560
know eggs in the morning and you know

1794
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:26,040
and protein in the afternoon and nothing

1795
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,400
but protein again in the afternoon

1796
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,679
protein in the evening and there's not a

1797
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,800
lot of room for what does stop cancer or

1798
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:35,000
kills cancer which is fresh fruits and

1799
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,320
vegetables and leafy greens and there's

1800
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,280
not enough of that in there it's not

1801
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:44,679
going to be enough to stop a cancer so

1802
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:46,920
easily that's not going to be enough so

1803
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:49,440
that oxygen diminishes the more higher

1804
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,080
fat you have in the bloodstream it shuts

1805
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,719
down the oxygen levels drops it down

1806
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:57,360
systematically it drops it down uh

1807
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:00,400
dramatically and so what happens is when

1808
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:03,560
that occurs your cancers aren't getting

1809
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,159
oxygen and Cancers Don't Like Oxygen so

1810
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,679
they like the fact that there's lower

1811
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:10,280
oxygen that's why exercise and you know

1812
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,520
and and fresh food does matter fresh

1813
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,800
fruits and

1814
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,719
vegetables because of the oxygen levels

1815
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,480
that occur in the body and when you thin

1816
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:18,920
out the blood a little bit Naturally by

1817
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,840
lowering the amount of fats you have

1818
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,560
like you don't have sausage and eggs for

1819
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,400
breakfast or you don't have a big of

1820
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,520
butter on top of some wheat pancakes

1821
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,679
with some lard in the pancake if you

1822
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,679
don't have that then your blood will be

1823
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,320
thinner more oxygen will get in areas

1824
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,440
that cancers could be developing to shut

1825
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:39,639
it down and stop it so it's really

1826
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:42,360
important too so right now in the world

1827
01:15:39,639 --> 01:15:43,800
of cancer Sugar's the enemy Sugar's the

1828
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,040
enemy as far as the information that's

1829
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:50,520
out there right now but I want you to

1830
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:53,320
know that that that line is blurred corn

1831
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:56,440
syrup yeah that that's not a good thing

1832
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:59,600
Thing by no means for cancer too much

1833
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:01,639
table sugar that's bad for cancer but

1834
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,400
what's really happening is fruit's being

1835
01:16:01,639 --> 01:16:05,719
thrown in there and fruit shouldn't be

1836
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:09,159
thrown in there because as I talk about

1837
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:11,040
many times fruit fear is is a dangerous

1838
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:12,840
thing when you're dealing with Cancers

1839
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,360
or worried or cancer in the family or

1840
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,800
something going on you you got to be

1841
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,360
getting those blueberries those wild

1842
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,320
blueberries you got to be getting those

1843
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:22,239
strawberries those cranberries

1844
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,639
especially those wild blueberries not

1845
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:27,239
the regular if you need get regular

1846
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:29,760
blueberries fine blackberries black

1847
01:16:27,239 --> 01:16:31,520
raspberries yeah sure you know there are

1848
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,000
a lot of information out there now it's

1849
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,840
that they're helpful and people are

1850
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,199
using that in their you know protocols

1851
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:42,719
for cancer but it's more than that it's

1852
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:44,440
melons it's apples it's bananas it's

1853
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,480
bananas really

1854
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:51,400
helpful okay it's papaya it's

1855
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:54,560
mango it's lots and lots of

1856
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:57,080
tomatoes lots and lots of Tomatoes all

1857
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,320
these are in incredibly health healthy

1858
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:03,120
for fighting and battling preventing

1859
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:04,600
cancer kiwis another one grapes and you

1860
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:07,520
might think well grapes are loaded with

1861
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:10,199
sugar actually the sugar and grapes is

1862
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:13,120
combined you can't separate the sugar

1863
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:16,440
when it's eaten from the phytochemical

1864
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:19,920
the antioxidants that kill cancer cells

1865
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:23,480
so what happens is when you eat a

1866
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:26,280
grape the sugar is going to go up the

1867
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:28,199
tent up the tentacle up the endogenesis

1868
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:30,719
travel the blood vessel and it's going

1869
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:34,199
to go into the tumor

1870
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:37,000
with something that the tumor cannot

1871
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:39,880
tolerate which is what's in the skin of

1872
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,560
the grapes it's what's in that skin of

1873
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:44,719
the grapes or in a

1874
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,239
raisin and that's dimethyl Resveratrol

1875
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,040
different subgroups of dimethyl

1876
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:50,920
Resveratrol that aren't even calculated

1877
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:52,239
or on any any you know the labs don't

1878
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,480
haven't even figured it out that there's

1879
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:56,520
all kinds of different stuff subgroups

1880
01:17:53,480 --> 01:18:01,480
from dimethyl Resveratrol all on its

1881
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:03,360
own and goes up into the tumor and it

1882
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,760
starts to kill the tumor starts to

1883
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:09,440
trigger off an anti-tumor shrinking an

1884
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:13,120
anti-tumor shrinking

1885
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:16,440
chemical that is inherently in your

1886
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:19,360
human cells so even though your human

1887
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,960
cells might have been mutated to such a

1888
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,679
point combined with the viral cell

1889
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,679
mutating becoming cancerous and them

1890
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:28,080
both joining and being inside of a

1891
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,520
living tumor that's growing even with

1892
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:34,880
that there's still something you can't

1893
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:36,840
break that's in that human cell inside

1894
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,480
of a cancerous tumor there's something

1895
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:42,480
you cannot

1896
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:45,960
break and it's information there's

1897
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:48,639
information there's a chemical compound

1898
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,760
that stays in that human

1899
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:53,800
cell that can be triggered to start

1900
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,320
shrinking a tumor

1901
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:59,199
and it takes and it

1902
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,120
takes exactly those kinds of foods to

1903
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,639
help someone fight the fight along with

1904
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:04,480
whatever else they're doing or choosing

1905
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:06,280
to do in life whatever really good

1906
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,880
Cancer Clinic they found or alternative

1907
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:11,679
Cancer Clinic they found and everything

1908
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:14,719
else but the foods matter they matter so

1909
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:17,120
greatly and the same thing with the wild

1910
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:19,719
blueberry it has these chemical

1911
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,840
compounds these dimethyl these subgroups

1912
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:24,159
off the dimethyl R veritol these

1913
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,520
subgroups that trigger off that chemical

1914
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,040
compound in a human cell that's been

1915
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,400
already denatured and mutated to the

1916
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,360
point where it's a cancer cell growing

1917
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,960
into a tumor and multiplying and growing

1918
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:35,400
and growing and

1919
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:37,639
growing so fruits and vegetables are

1920
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,159
critical if you can't handle any fruit

1921
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:40,760
for some reason you're worried about it

1922
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:42,679
then you just bring in more vegetables

1923
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,760
then and more greens and maybe some red

1924
01:19:42,679 --> 01:19:47,480
bell peppers and orange bell peppers

1925
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,120
bring in some more different foods if

1926
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,000
you can bring in the turmeric that's

1927
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:54,000
really

1928
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,159
important all these are important

1929
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,400
celer is important celery juice is

1930
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,400
important very helpful I talk about it

1931
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,800
all the

1932
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,639
time heavy metals get out the heavy

1933
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:07,960
metal detox that we talk about which is

1934
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:10,760
the sparine as sparine is a great great

1935
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:14,639
weapon as well barley grass juice powder

1936
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:16,000
a great weapon and you know and look any

1937
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:17,400
kind of anything I'm talking about in

1938
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,480
the supplements next with I'm going to

1939
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,880
talk about you can always go to my my

1940
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,400
page I don't sell the supplements but

1941
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,440
you can go to my page on my website and

1942
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,840
know what the ones I like the ones that

1943
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:30,320
I favor because I know how they help

1944
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,800
people and so it's a directory to get

1945
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,920
you the right so you know what you're

1946
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,840
getting weak grass juice weak grass is

1947
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,360
incredible there's there's um you know

1948
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,520
if you if you have a way of getting weak

1949
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:42,920
grass and juicing fresh weak grass

1950
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:45,400
that's a that fights that helps fight

1951
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:48,000
the fight because what happens is

1952
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,360
there's phytochemicals and weak grass

1953
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,320
that when they're drawn up into a tumor

1954
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,960
or or absorbed by D Atri cells that

1955
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,719
haven't become a tumor somewhere that

1956
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:59,040
haven't even become a tum tumor or a

1957
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:02,880
lesion that happens to be active with

1958
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:06,080
cancer cells now and that we crass is B

1959
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:08,360
phytochemicals that help to suppress the

1960
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,440
development the

1961
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:13,000
growth so all these are important

1962
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,239
supplements to kill off your Epstein

1963
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,239
bars we talk about that all the time and

1964
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:20,159
in the Epstein bar show I did before got

1965
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:21,520
to have enough zinc in your regimen okay

1966
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,199
that's important the lemon bomb's

1967
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,960
important nettle Leaf is

1968
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:30,199
helpful vitamin C lots and lots of

1969
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:34,040
vitamin C tumors lesions cancer cells

1970
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:37,719
pre-cancerous cells virus cells hate

1971
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:40,239
vitamin C absolutely hate vitamin C I

1972
01:21:37,719 --> 01:21:42,199
like the Lipo liposomal C that uh that I

1973
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:43,520
always recommend that's the one that I

1974
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:46,440
like there's a lot of different ones out

1975
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,639
there I don't like a lot of them um

1976
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:51,520
there's a really good one that I

1977
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:53,639
recommend that uh doesn't have corn in

1978
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,440
it and all the lipos Som Seas they all

1979
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:59,840
have corn in it so that's not a great

1980
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:02,040
thing so it's really important to know

1981
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,520
that so if you're concerned you want

1982
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,159
preventative or anything like that you

1983
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,719
do a wheat grass juice shot there's a

1984
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:10,000
company called Dynamic greens they grow

1985
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:11,199
their wheat grass in a field just like

1986
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,159
say grass-fed beef you know how

1987
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:14,639
everybody likes grass-fed beef because

1988
01:22:13,159 --> 01:22:17,719
they like that

1989
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,000
more and you know the wheat grass grows

1990
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:21,880
in a field because you know it's better

1991
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,199
that way too so that's a and then you

1992
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,960
can't get a hold of the that you don't

1993
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:27,280
want that product then just go into yeah

1994
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:30,679
the health food store and get the wheat

1995
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:32,920
grass juice you need right in the moment

1996
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,199
but the bottom line is it's all these

1997
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,719
different pieces so I'm going to run

1998
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:38,880
across them it's about getting the right

1999
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:41,159
leafy greens and different green

2000
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,280
chlorophyll substances in you but that's

2001
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:45,280
not old that's not new information

2002
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:47,520
that's not and and I know that but

2003
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:51,360
that's okay it was

2004
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,960
new back in the early 70s all right when

2005
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,239
Spirit was telling me this is what you

2006
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,600
need to be on this is what you need B

2007
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:58,800
this is what you need to get and getting

2008
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,480
it was near impossible back then near

2009
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:04,199
impossible but the bottom line the point

2010
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:06,239
I'm trying to say is that everything's

2011
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:09,040
that are fingertips now resources like

2012
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:11,800
never before so vitamin C is really

2013
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:13,360
important um I like IV vitamin C if

2014
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,800
you're if you're concerned about cancer

2015
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,040
possibilities talk to your doctor your

2016
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,400
cancer doctor everybody about vitamin IV

2017
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,719
you know vitamin C IV that's a really

2018
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,560
good thing and that's been out for

2019
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,719
helping people with cancer we know that

2020
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,000
that's been out there but you can also

2021
01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:28,960
take a really good lipos C if you're

2022
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,199
concerned which kills off Epstein bar

2023
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,800
knocks down Epstein bar lysine is

2024
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:35,239
important for knocking down Epstein bar

2025
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:39,239
that's another one that's really

2026
01:23:35,239 --> 01:23:40,760
important um so adding all these

2027
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:42,400
different things licorice is actually

2028
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,120
okay too and you know you can take

2029
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,880
licorice once licorice tea is really

2030
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:49,120
good you can do licorice tea to help

2031
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:51,600
bring down Epstein bar um that's helpful

2032
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,600
in many ways one of the things is is

2033
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,320
that there's this whole thing thing

2034
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,760
going on about estrogen and estrogen be

2035
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:58,520
creating Cancers and everything else and

2036
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:01,639
then there are forms of estrogen mutated

2037
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:04,440
forms of estrogen that we ingest and we

2038
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:07,159
consume every single day we consume them

2039
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:09,280
out of foods so they come out of foods

2040
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:11,639
so we have to be careful um if you're

2041
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,360
really worried about an estrogenic um

2042
01:24:11,639 --> 01:24:14,880
cancer then eggs you should never even

2043
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,600
touch I don't care if they're grown in

2044
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:19,679
somebody's backyard you shouldn't touch

2045
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,719
them so you you can't in milk and dairy

2046
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,760
products and everything else I would

2047
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,920
keep even in animal products down to a

2048
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,760
low if you're concerned about any kind

2049
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:30,600
of estrogen causing

2050
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:33,320
cancer but estrogen in its mutated form

2051
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,360
it's not it's not a um the woman's

2052
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:38,520
natural estrogen that's that's being

2053
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:42,280
produced by her adrenals or her

2054
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:45,159
reproductive system that grows cancer

2055
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:47,560
it's outside estrogens it's an entirely

2056
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:49,159
different estrogen but science and

2057
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:51,880
research is not separating that right

2058
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:53,119
now that's another problem we have um in

2059
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,639
general I mean I mean just that's a

2060
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:58,119
problem all on its

2061
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,560
own but anti-estrogenic Foods I'm

2062
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:01,760
talking about estrogenic foods that are

2063
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:03,040
actually the toxic ones that are out

2064
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,360
about that are in Plastics and

2065
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,920
everything else you could battle those

2066
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,520
with the right fruits and vegetables and

2067
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:11,280
making sure that you keep you know the

2068
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:13,600
eggs and the dairy and everything else

2069
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:16,320
down but there's little things you can

2070
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,080
do every day every day you can work on

2071
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,800
knocking down any kind of viral issue

2072
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,880
that you have with the right amount of

2073
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,679
vitamin C the lys

2074
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:29,000
and having enough zinc reserves those

2075
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:31,440
alone are important to knocking down any

2076
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,679
kind of herpes virus um in the herpes

2077
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,880
family hhv6 that create cancers epine

2078
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:38,600
bars that create

2079
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:42,600
cancers sparina knocks down and

2080
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:44,719
kills viral cells sparina can stop a

2081
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:46,440
thyroid from getting cancer by killing

2082
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:48,719
off Epstein bar and many other different

2083
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,639
viruses like hhv6 and the sevens the

2084
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:53,119
eights the NES the 10 11s the 12 you

2085
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,480
name it and all all the herpes viruses

2086
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:59,040
ceglar virus all of

2087
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:01,400
them and the simplexes one two but the

2088
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:03,560
bottom line is you can do these simple

2089
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:07,560
things get the spirulina get the vitamin

2090
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:09,639
C get the lemon bomm get the lysine you

2091
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,520
know that just that alone getting the

2092
01:26:09,639 --> 01:26:13,080
zinc reserves up to knock down the viral

2093
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,639
loads and then taking the foods that

2094
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,280
feed the viruses out and bring in foods

2095
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:21,239
like some Dand lion greens some MH some

2096
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:24,960
kale lots of spinach spinach is an

2097
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:26,960
incredible War Warrior for for keeping

2098
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,199
down cancers in people's bodies and

2099
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,280
knocking down Epstein bar and then all

2100
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:33,639
the different fruits grapes bananas

2101
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:37,960
apples peaches plums nectarines

2102
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:40,159
cranberries melons mangoes papayas kiwis

2103
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:42,119
right down the road right down the road

2104
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:44,719
all those should be in your diet and you

2105
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:46,880
shouldn't fear them or be afraid of them

2106
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:48,840
but stay away from the table sugars stay

2107
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,440
away from the corn syrups because most

2108
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,800
of the time those corn syrups and table

2109
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,199
sugars aren't going to be by themselves

2110
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:56,199
you're not going going to go and get a

2111
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:57,880
vial of corn syrup and just drink it

2112
01:26:56,199 --> 01:26:58,920
it's going to be in something else

2113
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,480
that's

2114
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,600
probably really helping cause a cancer

2115
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:06,040
meaning corn syrup combined with

2116
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,639
something that's nasty like a bad

2117
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,880
cupcake so we know that as far as grains

2118
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,440
go if you're somebody who likes them or

2119
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,639
don't like them you know if you have

2120
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:16,760
nothing to eat you're not wor quinoa is

2121
01:27:13,639 --> 01:27:18,400
actually not cancer causing it's not it

2122
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,800
won't feed a cancer is what I mean it

2123
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:24,760
won't feed a viral cell Millet won't

2124
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:27,360
feed a viral cell a black bean won't

2125
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:30,440
feed a viral cell a sweet potato a

2126
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:32,400
regular potato won't feed a viral cell

2127
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:35,159
so if you just lost your eggs and your

2128
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,920
Dairy and you're like what do I eat now

2129
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:38,520
you can have a potato that potato is

2130
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:41,080
going to protect you a lot more than an

2131
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:42,960
egg would any day

2132
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,480
anyhow and if you're someone that's

2133
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,600
doing a lot of lot of animal protein cut

2134
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:49,320
it in half cut it in half so you can

2135
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,920
make room for the things that actually

2136
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:54,239
stop cancer which are all the different

2137
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:57,560
Le leafy greens and the peppers and the

2138
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:59,040
tomatoes and the onions and the garlic

2139
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:02,840
Garlic's a great secret weapon for

2140
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:05,000
Epstein bar epine bar doesn't die in one

2141
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,960
day and either do the other herpes

2142
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,840
viruses but you can knock them down over

2143
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,840
time and avoid cancer in the future

2144
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,000
avoid the thyroid cancer the lung cancer

2145
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:16,560
the reproductive cancer the ovarian

2146
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,679
cancer the uterine

2147
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:23,159
cancer all right and you can avoid these

2148
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:24,679
the breast cancer can be avoided

2149
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:26,280
heavy metal detox and all the different

2150
01:28:24,679 --> 01:28:30,679
fresh fruits and vegetables and leafy

2151
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:35,520
greens help to eliminate toxins and

2152
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:37,560
poisons so that you can't feed viruses

2153
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,480
and get end up with some of the cancers

2154
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:42,239
like breast cancer so all these are

2155
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,440
incredibly important factors what I

2156
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:48,600
would do is you know listen out for more

2157
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:50,080
stuff about the Epstein bar that I do on

2158
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,760
on the radio shows and stuff like that

2159
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,760
and I'll fill you in more more more of

2160
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,600
that as well along the

2161
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,800
way but I want to talk about a little

2162
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,159
history for a couple of minutes though

2163
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,400
about the epscene bar and some of the

2164
01:28:59,159 --> 01:29:06,760
viruses they took off route back in the

2165
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:09,320
late 1800s early 1900s because of all

2166
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,080
the different arsenic combinations and

2167
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:14,000
all the different antibiotic Creations

2168
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:16,320
that were starting pre-antibiotic

2169
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,199
era that were all starting and they were

2170
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:21,600
using they're testing new fungicides and

2171
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:23,600
new antibiotics on food purposely all

2172
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,960
through the late 1800s and early 1900s

2173
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,679
so we were getting a tremendous amount

2174
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,840
of early poison in that day which

2175
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:33,880
actually fueled a very benign

2176
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:35,760
non-destructive viral cell that grew

2177
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,560
into something more over the decades

2178
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,719
through the 1900s and that's why it's to

2179
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:42,480
the point it is now and I talk about

2180
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:43,159
that a lot on the Epstein bar shows that

2181
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,280
I

2182
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:48,159
do

2183
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,119
um prayer is important keep that in your

2184
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,760
heart and soul all right and pat

2185
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:53,239
yourself on the back take it easy if you

2186
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,280
know know someone suffering or going

2187
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:58,280
through something know that you can do

2188
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:01,159
so much you can do so many great things

2189
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,600
and you can do so many good things and

2190
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:04,040
we take it one day at a time and we

2191
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,520
start getting the different supplements

2192
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,480
and I want to go across while we still

2193
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,719
have time a few more supplements

2194
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:12,960
too and um there's some supplements I

2195
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:15,080
like I love turmeric I love curcumin

2196
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,080
that's great I love coenzyme Q10 I love

2197
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:20,199
that I love ala okay for helping prevent

2198
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:23,960
cancers helping people along with their

2199
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:25,560
immune systems I do like bees it's one

2200
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,600
thing that you'll hear out there is all

2201
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:30,360
the bees feed

2202
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:33,199
cancers but when you

2203
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:35,400
minus the when you bring down the viral

2204
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,880
load down in your bodies when people

2205
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,679
bring down the viral load down and you

2206
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:42,600
bring down the toxic load everywhere

2207
01:30:38,679 --> 01:30:44,639
else a B vitamin will not be harmful and

2208
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:49,119
that is misinformation about bees it

2209
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:52,000
just so happens they find B vitamin in

2210
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:54,440
some cancer tumors and they have the

2211
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,119
discovered that but they've also found

2212
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:59,040
every mineral and many vitamins and

2213
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:01,840
nutrients that happen to accidentally

2214
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:03,920
get up there because the the cancer

2215
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:07,040
tumors and and the cells don't want

2216
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:09,960
those it just so happens those th those

2217
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:12,440
nutrients get delivered they don't feed

2218
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:14,000
the tumor and they don't grow the tumor

2219
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,600
the tumors and the cancer cells they

2220
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,600
just want to go through this vitamin B

2221
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:21,960
the thing a little bit with you guys

2222
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:23,679
while we can um tumors grow from all the

2223
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,960
other things they talked about all the

2224
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,199
other things that it likes and the

2225
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,119
cancers like and the viral cells and the

2226
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:32,760
viral cancers like that's what tumers

2227
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:36,560
grow on they don't

2228
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:39,440
grow on vitamin B by itself you know all

2229
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,000
the vitamin B's by themselves they don't

2230
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:43,320
and they don't grow on a mineral by

2231
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,480
itself and they don't grow on a nutrient

2232
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,520
or a vitamin by itself and all those can

2233
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:51,400
be traces of all those could be found in

2234
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,440
cancers because it goes up the the it

2235
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,920
goes up up the chot it goes up the

2236
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:57,520
androgenesis it goes up the tentacles

2237
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,920
and it also goes into lesions it goes

2238
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,880
into different different cancers and

2239
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,239
different Fabrics of you know all that

2240
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:04,880
and it gets into different connected

2241
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:07,119
tissue cancers and everything else and

2242
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:09,400
so as it's going up in there there are

2243
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:11,880
traces that are found and a mistake is

2244
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:14,000
made about how Vitamin B's are really

2245
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,239
dangerous with a cancer it's not

2246
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,360
accurate it's all the foods and all the

2247
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:21,560
poisons that the tumor relies on

2248
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:24,719
Non-Stop someone can avoid a little bit

2249
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:27,080
of B12 or they could avoid a you know

2250
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,440
methola but they're eating eggs every

2251
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,360
day while they're dealing with a Cancer

2252
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,080
and that's what I'm talking about

2253
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,400
critical and subtle differences of

2254
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:37,440
understanding this stuff that's

2255
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:39,400
important so I just want to give you

2256
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:42,080
example too I mean people literally eat

2257
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:44,480
eggs all day long or every day three

2258
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,400
eggs a day one egg a day and they're

2259
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,800
avoiding a B vitamin that can help

2260
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,679
protect their nervous system and other

2261
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,960
parts of their body so they could stay

2262
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,760
strong protect their immune system so

2263
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,440
they could stay strong

2264
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:57,239
so that's another aspect of of what one

2265
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,960
of the misunderstandings is going out

2266
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:01,440
there I mean you don't have to OD on the

2267
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,679
bees you can take a little bit you just

2268
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,080
don't want to go to fishing and never

2269
01:33:02,679 --> 01:33:05,360
take a B vitamin because you're afraid

2270
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:07,719
it's going to feed a cancer you can take

2271
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:10,239
a little bit of B

2272
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:12,560
vitamins so that's one other thing now

2273
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:14,679
in the herbal world I love a lot of

2274
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:18,159
different herbs for fighting

2275
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:22,360
cancer here's the thing every single

2276
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:25,159
herb does fight cancer every single herb

2277
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:28,800
has phytochemicals within it that does

2278
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:32,000
 and fight cancer it does suppress

2279
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,960
stop slows down or fights or kills some

2280
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,960
cancers every single

2281
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:41,560
herb so I like Elder

2282
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:42,760
flow um crysanthemum flower I love these

2283
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:47,280
I even like

2284
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:49,920
Elderberry Elderberry is great rose hips

2285
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:53,560
amazing for really helping with

2286
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:55,880
Cancers all right you Yaro berock root

2287
01:33:53,560 --> 01:34:00,000
dandelion root little bits of that like

2288
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:02,600
some tea could be really helpful Yaro

2289
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,320
that's another great one Mullen Leaf

2290
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:07,920
it's another one too so all these herbs

2291
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:09,440
are really helpful and really wonderful

2292
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,119
so if you're a practitioner too and you

2293
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,679
want to try a different herb ibrite

2294
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:15,080
that's a great one and like of course I

2295
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:16,560
said before nettle Leaf lemon Bal those

2296
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:18,840
are great as

2297
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:21,320
well so these are some of the herbs that

2298
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:24,000
you can you know think about red root is

2299
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:27,560
a good one too that helps and that's a

2300
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,119
good one as well so think about those

2301
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,520
and incorporating some of those but

2302
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,040
fresh fruits and vegetables no matter

2303
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,560
what Avenue you go whether you go

2304
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:35,920
Chinese medicine or you go to just a

2305
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,159
different alternative doctor or you go

2306
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,480
straight to a conventional doctor or

2307
01:34:37,159 --> 01:34:40,320
whatever it is that you're doing or you

2308
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,159
know somebody bring in the more fruits

2309
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:44,880
and vegetables lower the animal proteins

2310
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:47,440
a bit if you just can't do without the

2311
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,639
animal proteins have them once a day I

2312
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,560
stand behind that but bring in some of

2313
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:54,679
these other foods that I mentioned today

2314
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:57,520
and um so a little recap we talked about

2315
01:34:54,679 --> 01:35:01,600
how it takes a virus and it takes these

2316
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:05,920
toxins to create a cancer but viruses

2317
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:08,400
cancers are almost all all viral so when

2318
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,040
you really look at it it's all viral and

2319
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:14,280
that's something that's always been kept

2320
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:16,199
in the dark and kept in the closet so

2321
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,040
always remember that you know most I

2322
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:23,280
mean literally most and I'm talking

2323
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:26,000
about most every single cancer is viral

2324
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:27,360
that's that's the whole point now um and

2325
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,719
there's people like look just a little

2326
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:32,400
reminder again there's people that don't

2327
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:34,679
get any viral sickness like they maybe

2328
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,960
experience mono from Epstein bar when

2329
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:38,800
they're younger and then it goes away

2330
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,960
and they don't exper you know they never

2331
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,480
they don't have the chronic fatigue they

2332
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:43,639
don't have the fibromyalgia that I talk

2333
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:45,800
about all the time that that epine bar

2334
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:47,440
causes and they don't have that but then

2335
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:49,560
a cancer can still develop later on

2336
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:50,880
because the viruses could be a little

2337
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,400
bit different there's still all these

2338
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,920
different Vari ities of Epstein bar

2339
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,520
talked about and different varieties so

2340
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,159
recapping different varieties of the

2341
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,520
hhv6 different varieties of all these

2342
01:35:57,159 --> 01:36:01,560
different viruses and especially epsteen

2343
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,719
bar the Epstein bar is in you know

2344
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,199
that's the spotlight right now you know

2345
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:07,360
that's the spotlight right now that that

2346
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:09,520
I'm bringing that I've actually brought

2347
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,159
to the world like if if you look at my

2348
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,679
uh look if you want to know more about

2349
01:36:11,159 --> 01:36:16,600
Epstein bar you get the first book

2350
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:19,280
medical medium but just so you know the

2351
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:22,199
thyroid healing book that one right

2352
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,520
there is is even taking it to a whole

2353
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:26,280
another level too but I always say to

2354
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,520
people look you need both you need

2355
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,440
medical medium books so you can learn

2356
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,040
about the viruses how they work how they

2357
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,400
get into the thyroid the whole bit but

2358
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:37,199
the thyroid healing book takes it to a

2359
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:39,440
level that no one's ever seen and even

2360
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,960
the first book no one's ever seen that I

2361
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:42,320
took it to that level but this is a

2362
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,679
whole another thing so I tell people you

2363
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:47,000
have to have both and then I I also when

2364
01:36:44,679 --> 01:36:50,320
it comes down to cancers in the

2365
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:54,080
life-changing Foods book um I mean I

2366
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:57,840
have easily over 60 70 cancers 50

2367
01:36:54,080 --> 01:37:01,159
cancers um easy 50 that's for sure Plus

2368
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:03,280
in there and and what foods help all the

2369
01:37:01,159 --> 01:37:04,719
different cancers so you know what foods

2370
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,199
whether it's lung cancer liver cancer

2371
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,400
whether it's leukemia whatever it is

2372
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:11,239
what foods help too with all those

2373
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,520
different cancers so you know I I do

2374
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:15,719
have cancer information throughout the

2375
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,280
books the thyroid healing book takes the

2376
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:21,520
viral information even further than ever

2377
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:23,520
before in history uh at least iCal

2378
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:25,280
medium history of course and history on

2379
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,840
the outside as well so it's really

2380
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:30,520
important to understand so

2381
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:32,719
recapping cancers are viral and that's

2382
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:34,840
the whole point and and that's what's

2383
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,520
been hidden and it's about how that

2384
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:39,639
virus like I talked about earlier how

2385
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:42,159
that virus starts and what it does it

2386
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:44,080
bring it starts and then it roots and

2387
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:45,800
then it turns into something more and I

2388
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:48,320
talked about how you need the toxins

2389
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,520
that's the other half of it but but yet

2390
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,679
you know if someone doesn't have the

2391
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,080
viral issue if they don't have the

2392
01:37:50,679 --> 01:37:54,880
Epstein bar the variety of Epstein bar

2393
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:56,639
the mutated variety of Epstein bar out

2394
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:59,520
of all the different 60 varieties I talk

2395
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,800
about in medical medium book one if if

2396
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,679
you don't have that going on and you

2397
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:05,320
just have the toxins then you can get

2398
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,760
you know kind of sick in a different way

2399
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:10,440
that's not cancerous you can still get a

2400
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:13,239
benign tumor you can still get a lipoma

2401
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,400
a fatty tumor and you can still get all

2402
01:38:13,239 --> 01:38:17,960
these different things or or other kinds

2403
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:20,960
of sicknesses too be from having you

2404
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:23,000
know constant exposure to so many toxins

2405
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,159
and and it's like I was saying before

2406
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,199
just you know recapping on like the lung

2407
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:30,199
cancer thing too is somebody could smoke

2408
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:32,159
for 50 60 years and not get lung cancer

2409
01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:34,080
somebody else smokes for four years and

2410
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:37,880
gets lung cancer they have to you to

2411
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:40,520
have the virus has to be around and so

2412
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:43,560
that all that's important to understand

2413
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:45,440
um but you know keep in mind if you you

2414
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,639
know to to Really you know hook into

2415
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:49,800
some of the there's a 28-day cleanse on

2416
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:51,800
medical medium book one on the book

2417
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:55,000
medical medium there's a 28 cleanse

2418
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:57,119
that's amazing for cancer really really

2419
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,119
powerful for cancer and the reason why

2420
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:02,880
I'm bringing this up and bringing all

2421
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:05,159
the books up is because what what you

2422
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,920
have to keep in mind to protect yourself

2423
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:08,400
from these Cancers and to protect

2424
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,800
yourself from ever getting them or if

2425
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:13,199
you have them you know getting you need

2426
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:16,080
that reinforcement you have to empty the

2427
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:18,440
body of the toxins I talked about all

2428
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:21,440
the leftover toxins we inherit and I

2429
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:23,360
might not have expressed that earlier um

2430
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:25,560
in this webinar about how we inherit

2431
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:29,119
these toxins heavy metals are passed

2432
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:31,920
down for thousands of years thousands of

2433
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:34,280
years in our family line it's not genes

2434
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,760
that take us down it's not a gene

2435
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:39,199
problem our forefathers have mercury in

2436
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:42,920
them our forefathers have led Mercury

2437
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:44,280
 nickel um aluminum it going back

2438
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:47,599
especially Mercury that's that's

2439
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:49,840
actually one of the oldest and so we

2440
01:39:47,599 --> 01:39:52,920
inherit these metals and then we inherit

2441
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:55,800
DDT from the 19 1920s 1930s when DDT

2442
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,599
saturated everybody and DDT doesn't go

2443
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:59,920
away you pass it on to your you pass it

2444
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:02,960
on to your children just right just just

2445
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:05,080
from the pregnancy itself literally um

2446
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,679
and and it starts there right in the egg

2447
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,880
right in the pregnancy itself right

2448
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:11,199
there and that DDT is passed on and that

2449
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,599
DDT comes from being saturated same

2450
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:14,239
thing with all the chemicals and all the

2451
01:40:12,599 --> 01:40:17,159
solvents and everything else and we're

2452
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:21,159
passing down a tremendous amount of

2453
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:23,159
toxin unlike ever before in history and

2454
01:40:21,159 --> 01:40:25,159
then it gets blamed on jeans because

2455
01:40:23,159 --> 01:40:27,440
remember it has to be blamed on you like

2456
01:40:25,159 --> 01:40:30,400
I said earlier it has to be blamed on

2457
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:32,920
you and the blame has to go on you and

2458
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,760
not the mistakes made not all the

2459
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:37,199
industries including the medical

2460
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:39,480
industry and all the other Industries

2461
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:40,719
because you know that's the whole point

2462
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,159
so it's going to be thrown you're going

2463
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,760
to be thrown into the genetic game

2464
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:45,840
everybody's going to be thrown in that

2465
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,560
and I know there's first of all I know

2466
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:49,400
genes are obviously real they're

2467
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:51,480
valuable in so many ways and they're

2468
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:54,920
valuable in science I'm not

2469
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:57,639
debunking that factor but I am telling

2470
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:59,520
you that they're going to also use genes

2471
01:40:57,639 --> 01:41:01,400
against you when they shouldn't because

2472
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,719
it's not part of the equation in certain

2473
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:05,520
areas and remember I tell you at the I

2474
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:07,440
told you at the very beginning there's

2475
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,360
subtle and

2476
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:12,280
critical differences the critical

2477
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:14,119
differences one is yes genes are

2478
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:16,599
important to study in science and they

2479
01:41:14,119 --> 01:41:18,239
matter in in many different ways but

2480
01:41:16,599 --> 01:41:21,360
it's not why everybody's getting sick

2481
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:23,560
with cancer right now it's not it's from

2482
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:26,040
all this all these toxins literally

2483
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,880
being passed down and amplifying and

2484
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,520
adding more more like never before in

2485
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,480
history the thousands of chemicals that

2486
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:34,119
are falling out of the sky every day on

2487
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:35,880
us and everything else and that's just a

2488
01:41:34,119 --> 01:41:37,960
fraction of what I'm talking about and

2489
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,040
so and including the inheriting the

2490
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:43,599
inheriting the amount of poison and then

2491
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:46,679
the inher inheriting of viruses that

2492
01:41:43,599 --> 01:41:48,599
have grown in strength so if if you know

2493
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:52,040
if your if your grandmother had breast

2494
01:41:48,599 --> 01:41:54,280
cancer it's possible yes it's not a gene

2495
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:56,360
thing that occurs where now you're going

2496
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:58,239
to be genetically you know susceptible

2497
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:01,159
no it's the virus that could have been

2498
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:02,920
passed down and it could it these

2499
01:42:01,159 --> 01:42:04,480
viruses have information they stay alive

2500
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:06,080
and they have memory unless you kill

2501
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,480
them unless you kill them and break them

2502
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,480
down and work on it and that's what I

2503
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:11,560
dedicated the first book medical medium

2504
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:13,199
and I dedicated thyroid healing for

2505
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:15,639
breaking down these viruses and doing

2506
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:17,719
the right things to knock the stuff down

2507
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:20,239
knock the Epstein bar down and and take

2508
01:42:17,719 --> 01:42:21,960
it out and push it out of the body so

2509
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:24,960
these things are incredible all this

2510
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:27,000
information is imperative to know that

2511
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:29,040
we inherit these poisons we inherit many

2512
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,679
of the viruses and so forth but there is

2513
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:34,159
someone to blame and it's not you and so

2514
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,679
when you lose a loved one with cancer or

2515
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,360
something happens where someone had you

2516
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:40,480
know a loved one has or a child has

2517
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:42,760
leukemia it's not their body you know

2518
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:44,840
children with leukemia have tons of

2519
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,719
mercury much higher amount of mercury

2520
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,080
they have the heavy metals number one

2521
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,760
they also have the monov virus the one

2522
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:53,639
that creates leukemia that I talk about

2523
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:56,040
about in book one medical medium and

2524
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:58,119
that virus starts out the leukemia

2525
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,599
Factor that's the whole point and that's

2526
01:42:58,119 --> 01:43:01,159
what's going on that's why there's so

2527
01:42:59,599 --> 01:43:02,239
many different now leukemias that

2528
01:43:01,159 --> 01:43:04,520
they're figuring out they don't even

2529
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:06,840
know what to do they just use they do

2530
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,159
the chemotherapy for leukemia because

2531
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,880
and then they're using also different

2532
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:11,920
drugs like immunosuppressive drugs and

2533
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:14,040
chemotherapy together because they don't

2534
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,800
they don't understand that it literally

2535
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:18,840
is the Epstein bar virus that creates

2536
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,760
leukemia and and many of the children

2537
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:24,040
they they don't know that part to that

2538
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:26,840
agree yet and a recap as I said before

2539
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:28,920
cancer is only judged on the merits of

2540
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:32,000
its manifesting already turning into

2541
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:33,960
something already being something and

2542
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,639
not like catching it way before so when

2543
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:36,880
you hear about you know cancer

2544
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,000
preventative and everything else from

2545
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,920
experts and all that if they're not

2546
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,400
talking about what we talked about today

2547
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,520
in this webinar if they're not talking

2548
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:48,480
about the information we're talking

2549
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,320
about how it really starts how the how

2550
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:52,440
the virus poisons the tissue and

2551
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,360
everything else that the remanufacturing

2552
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:57,679
the poison everything else that you guys

2553
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:59,400
now know the truth the real truth the

2554
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:01,440
real truth when we say truth out there

2555
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:03,920
it doesn't mean it's all truth or

2556
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:05,679
exactly the truth and that's another

2557
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,920
problem too and so we can get sucked

2558
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:10,599
into it real easy so the thyroid healing

2559
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,239
book when it says truth about Hashimoto

2560
01:44:10,599 --> 01:44:16,800
on that book it's really the truth about

2561
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:19,280
Hashimoto not not information and

2562
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:21,880
studies that had interest groups behind

2563
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:23,400
it okay and Kickbacks and medical

2564
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:25,080
funding and everything else that had to

2565
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:27,280
make something come out a certain way

2566
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:30,239
the cake just come out just right

2567
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:32,440
because so much was at stake and and you

2568
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:34,360
know angled a certain way it's like the

2569
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:37,239
whole thing with the sugar thing you

2570
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:40,520
know corn syrup can yeah can instigate

2571
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:43,639
cancer cells but no one studied a piece

2572
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:46,239
of fruit with the cancer killing

2573
01:44:43,639 --> 01:44:49,480
phytochemicals within the sugar combine

2574
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:52,520
that's never been put to a lab or test

2575
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:55,000
to show how it kills cancer cells so

2576
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:58,599
then all Sugar's ostracized because of

2577
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,960
it all sugar is is is you know is is is

2578
01:44:58,599 --> 01:45:03,000
is called wrong when it's really the

2579
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:05,679
things that you know we need to actually

2580
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,560
cure cancer help with cancer the in the

2581
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,599
it's in there and so these

2582
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,280
phytochemicals so it's all about the

2583
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:15,119
studies being twisted and bodged and

2584
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,599
everything else is said the very

2585
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:20,000
beginning in the opening you guys and so

2586
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:21,599
because of that when we deal with the

2587
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,599
truth and thyroid healing says it's the

2588
01:45:21,599 --> 01:45:25,199
truth about Hashimoto you you're going

2589
01:45:23,599 --> 01:45:26,840
to have to you're definitely going to

2590
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,760
have to have your cam te with you when

2591
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:30,280
you read that book because you're your

2592
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:33,800
eyeballs are going to just they're going

2593
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:36,280
to pop out in a good way in a good way

2594
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,880
as you're reading that and you're you're

2595
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:41,280
going to be like oh my God and so you

2596
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:43,040
need to understand all this uh So you

2597
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:45,400
you're you're you got the armor you got

2598
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:48,760
the protection so you're you're guarded

2599
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:51,679
in a safe way you know the whole point

2600
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,360
is look we have have to protect you

2601
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:56,239
that's the whole point and that's what

2602
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:57,719
I've always done since I was a child so

2603
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,840
I want to talk about the foods a little

2604
01:45:57,719 --> 01:46:03,199
bit too a little bit more about the

2605
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:05,280
foods chaga mushroom fantastic chaga

2606
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,719
mushroom reishi mushroom that's another

2607
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,400
thing that's great for cancers now and

2608
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,639
that information's out there that is but

2609
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,560
I still have to remind you of some of

2610
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:13,639
the things that are out there uh and

2611
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,159
some of the things that I've been using

2612
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:16,960
before that information got out there

2613
01:46:15,159 --> 01:46:19,159
once again like the like the reishi

2614
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,239
mushroom I'm going back since I was 8

2615
01:46:19,159 --> 01:46:23,560
years old I was telling people to use

2616
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:25,360
reishi mushroom for cancer and nobody

2617
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:30,040
even knew what that was or how to get it

2618
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:31,400
it was unbelievable Corps um Lion's man

2619
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,599
those are all great I want to cover

2620
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:35,400
juicing a little bit more deeper um

2621
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:36,960
asparagus juice now here's how the

2622
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:38,840
juicing Works to really help with

2623
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,000
Cancers preventing cancer helping with

2624
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,119
everything so anything you're doing in

2625
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,280
your regime whether you're getting

2626
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:46,480
chemotherapy whether you're getting uh

2627
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:48,760
you know radiation uh um you know

2628
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:50,560
synchronized radiation uh blast the

2629
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:52,080
whole bit that that we do they l they're

2630
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,560
doing better with radiation now they'd

2631
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,400
ever did before even though you know a

2632
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:57,840
lot of people are against it some people

2633
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:59,960
hate it some people like it it's it's

2634
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,040
just you know it it's complicated every

2635
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,639
bit about it everybody's different every

2636
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:05,480
doctor's different every Clinic is

2637
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:06,880
different too so wherever you're going

2638
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,199
whether it's the natural clinics where

2639
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,239
you're just getting nothing but

2640
01:47:08,199 --> 01:47:11,800
intravenous or you're getting um a

2641
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:13,599
combination of a holistic Clinic that's

2642
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:16,920
doing some chemotherapy plus other

2643
01:47:13,599 --> 01:47:20,400
things whatever it is juicing can fit

2644
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:23,280
into any of those places to help you

2645
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:26,159
either prevent cancer um if you or or

2646
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:29,520
combat it or help reverse it or whatever

2647
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:32,040
whatever you need so so in the juicing I

2648
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:34,960
like a base in the juice the base

2649
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:36,920
meaning it could be apple yes Apple

2650
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,560
believe it or not okay CU I know that

2651
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:41,239
you know that's shunned in so many

2652
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,480
situations which it shouldn't be on any

2653
01:47:41,239 --> 01:47:45,400
level it I mean there's so many cancer

2654
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:48,679
fighting properties in an apple it's

2655
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:50,119
insane so a little bit of Apple celery

2656
01:47:48,679 --> 01:47:52,639
which is a secret weapon that should be

2657
01:47:50,119 --> 01:47:54,880
a strong base cucumber could be a base

2658
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:57,360
too now if you can just do plain celery

2659
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,840
as your base you can do plain cucumber

2660
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:01,360
as your base or apple but here's the

2661
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:03,719
trick now it's adding it's adding the

2662
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:05,840
accents on top of this so what I like to

2663
01:48:03,719 --> 01:48:08,760
do for cancers is and real cancer

2664
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,840
preventative as you do your you do you

2665
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:13,520
know a good half celery juice you could

2666
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:15,000
you know good 10 12 ounces or 16 ounces

2667
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,239
of celery juice whatever and then you

2668
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,800
run some asparagus in you only need a

2669
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:22,840
few ounces of

2670
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,800
you know the the addition so asparagus

2671
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:27,800
is one of them asparagus is one of the

2672
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,800
the greatest cancer Fighters out there

2673
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,800
so always remember that so you can do

2674
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:33,960
this juice where you're juicing your

2675
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:36,040
celery you got a nice glass of celery or

2676
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:39,080
celery apple or cucumber and then you

2677
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:41,119
put in your asparagus at the top juice

2678
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:42,880
that in and you get your 3 oz of

2679
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:44,440
asparagus it's really potent when it's

2680
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,880
Juiced and you get that mixed in your

2681
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:49,400
juice that's a weapon another thing is

2682
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,960
cabbage you can then get your base you

2683
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:53,440
get your celery you get your celery you

2684
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:55,000
get your cucumber or you just whatever

2685
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,840
one you want in the base like I said

2686
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,159
before and then you take you take that

2687
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,080
cabbage and you put the Cabbage through

2688
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:03,000
there and you get a good few ounces of

2689
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,920
cabbage

2690
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,480
juice and that is another secret weapon

2691
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,960
you can choose red cabbage you can to

2692
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:13,239
choose green cabbage and that's a great

2693
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:15,599
secret weapon um broccoli Sprouts

2694
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:17,520
they're very potent very sharp but you

2695
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:19,679
can eat those you can throw those as an

2696
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,280
accent in the juice any Sprout can be

2697
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:25,360
put through the juice or a little bit of

2698
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:27,960
red clover fenugreek um peases sunflower

2699
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:30,320
greens all these can be together if you

2700
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:33,080
really want or separate and you you put

2701
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:37,239

2750
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:27,079
heavy metals out but they take Plastics

2751
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:29,040
out they take DDT out in the liver

2752
01:51:27,079 --> 01:51:31,599
that's been there long before you were

2753
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:34,119
born meaning in your in your parents and

2754
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:36,280

2755
01:51:34,119 --> 01:51:38,760
things chemical solvents from carpets

01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:40,920
from rugs from you know just anything

2757
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:43,400
that you've gotten into you throughout

2758
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:46,440
the years that is feeding the original

2759
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:48,880
viruses that start up cancer and so

2760
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:50,599
don't underestimate that the power of

2761
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:55,520
that as well

2762
01:51:50,599 --> 01:51:58,560
uh always remember that so um and hey

2763
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,239
look uh bottom line is when you get that

2764
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,239
copy of thyroid healing in your hands

2765
01:52:01,239 --> 01:52:06,040
you're going to have more information

2766
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:08,040
than you just ever thought existed and

2767
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:09,920
I'm really excited about that I would

2768
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:11,840
get medical medium because I got the 28

2769
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,000
day cleanse which I love for cancer

2770
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,800
always have it's it's incredible for for

2771
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,800
helping people with cancer because what

2772
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:20,840
it does thins out the blood gets oxygen

2773
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,520
oxygen in places where cancer doesn't

2774
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:26,040
want oxygen and that's what I really

2775
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,599
like and so no matter what your diet is

2776
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:29,520
you know whatever your diet is too you

2777
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,480
can always do a 28- day cleanse to

2778
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:34,840
really support yourself protect yourself

2779
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:36,079
and have that extra extra bonus um you

2780
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,360
know if you're dealing with Cancers or

2781
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:39,119
anything like that keep your diet

2782
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:40,800
relatively lowfat if you love animal

2783
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:43,360
products like I said you know just you

2784
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:46,079
know keep them don't don't be you know

2785
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:48,320
don't do the bacon in the morning the

2786
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:49,639
the eggs for lunch the eggs and tuna for

2787
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,880
lunch and then you know you move and

2788
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:52,480
then dinner time lots of chicken and

2789
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:55,000
beef try to pick one of those things

2790
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:57,040
just don't do the eggs of course and um

2791
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,480
because you want your blood not so fat I

2792
01:52:57,040 --> 01:53:00,159
have nothing against animal products

2793
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:04,000
it's just that you don't want the blood

2794
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:06,239
so thick so thick and pasty that oxygen

2795
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,960
and nutrients can't get phytochemicals

2796
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:11,440
that stop cancer can't get to tumors to

2797
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:14,159
cysts to lesions to tissue that needs to

2798
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:15,960
repair itself and and that's really

2799
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:18,119
important to understand regardless of

2800
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:19,520
what experts say out there and like I

2801
01:53:18,119 --> 01:53:21,320
said before some of the stuff is going

2802
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:24,639
to be something completely opposite to

2803
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:27,400
what you've heard what you've known but

2804
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:29,480
you know I've seen success for decades

2805
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:32,040
proven success for decades and decades

2806
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:34,599
with all illnesses so so we we like to

2807
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:37,400
give people what they need for sure and

2808
01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:40,360
um look when you knock your viral load

2809
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:44,119
down when you knock that Epstein bar

2810
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:45,840
down that res that sits in so many of us

2811
01:53:44,119 --> 01:53:49,360
when you knock that down you knock down

2812
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:52,920
other viruses that could be trouble um

2813
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:55,440
you take take control you actually take

2814
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:58,199
control and it moves you forward you

2815
01:53:55,440 --> 01:54:00,159
take control into a place of healing

2816
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:01,760
that you didn't even know existed

2817
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:05,079
meaning giving you protection for the

2818
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,639
future your future self your future self

2819
01:54:05,079 --> 01:54:07,760
because you know we look at ourselves in

2820
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,199
the future we don't want to see

2821
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,800
ourselves sick we don't want to see

2822
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:14,840
ourselves dealing with with a cancer or

2823
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:16,480
fibromyalgia or ra or all these things I

2824
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:18,599
talk about Epstein bar creates and

2825
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,800
causes or Hashimoto or whatever it is

2826
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:23,119
you know I you don't want to have to see

2827
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,800
yourself sick in the future and so you

2828
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:29,280
want to knock your viral loads down and

2829
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:32,719
that's what a part of all this is too so

2830
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:36,599
keep in mind um with all all of

2831
01:54:32,719 --> 01:54:38,239
everything I said today and um and yeah

2832
01:54:36,599 --> 01:54:40,159
we move forward and that's the bottom

2833
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:43,800
line we move forward so I think this

2834
01:54:40,159 --> 01:54:45,639
concludes at least one part one part and

2835
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,520
look we're going to be doing a lot more

2836
01:54:45,639 --> 01:54:48,880
than this so just please listen out

2837
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:50,119
because we're going to we're going to be

2838
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,599
doing more than this and going to go in

2839
01:54:50,119 --> 01:54:53,920
depth in other ways and other different

2840
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:56,280
illnesses and everything else including

2841
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,560
