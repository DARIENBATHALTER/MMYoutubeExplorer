little bit

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
okay so that's what i'm doing i'm making

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,080
the potato cauliflower

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,680
mash it's not about how do we how to not

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,599
getting blood work i want you guys to

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,040
get blood work you guys got good doctors

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,959
you go to your doctor

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
but i talk all about how to do it to

81
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,959
protect yourself it's critical actually

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
because they're taking too much blood

83
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
from everybody that's what they do

84
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
and you know what when you're sick i

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
mean it can take you down a real wrong

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,680
direction

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,680
and really hurt a lot of people it has

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
it's actually killed a lot of people too

89
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
because they stay chronically ill

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
chronically ill and they get drained and

91
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,480
guess what the worst part

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
about the blood draw is the one of the

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,080
worst parts

94
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,440
is deficiencies they take from you then

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
they take from you more and you get a

96
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
deficiency now you're getting more

97
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,000
deficiencies you can get

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
deficient from all that blood work this

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
is so scary

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
um gene why don't you use

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
why don't you use the potato i always

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
use potato skins it's just that this

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
recipe

104
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,799
is a different recipe it's the potato

105
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080

106
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
skins i'll show you the recipe in a

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,760
second so i got some water steaming a

108
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
little bit in the pan right here you

109
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
guys

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,519
and i'm just just taking some skins off

111
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720

112
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,440

there we go

115
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,080
it's another potato got that

116
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
got some cauliflower too it's potato

117
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
cauliflower mash

118
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,200
you know it's it's friday it's a great

119
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,439
day for this tara galloway amazing

120
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
podcast love it incredible did you

121
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,360
share it with anybody to help protect

122
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,799
them so they have the information

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
elena when i go fat free i feel fatigue

124
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,680
are you getting enough calories number

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
one first of all there's a couple of

126
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,799
reasons for that

127
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,919
when you're doing the fats it stimulates

128
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,120
adrenaline

129
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,840
so um fats cause the adrenals to

130
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
actually

131
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,320
flood so what happens is there you can

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
actually get addicted to fats you can

133
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,520
get addicted to

134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,840
oils and avocados and nut butters and um

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
and you can get addicted to

136
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,680
cheeseburgers

137
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,960
and because the reason why an ice cream

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
because fats

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
they make the adrenals run because your

140
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,440
adrenals are trying to thin out your

141
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
blood

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,479
so that your heart doesn't have to deal

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
with all that fat in your bloodstream

144
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,240
right so the minute

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,000
you take away those fats your adrenals

146
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
you save your adrenals but here's what's

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
gonna happen

148
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,000
you're gonna get your adrenals nice and

149
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,440
strong any day you're fat

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
free you're going to get your adrenals

151
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,680
nice and strong to the point where your

152
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
adrenals are finally better and there is

153
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
no fatigue

154
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
another thing too is did you ever feel

155
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
fatigued before

156
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
is that this the first time it's like or

157
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
is fatigue one of your symptoms you've

158
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
been dealing with all this time right

159
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,759
so think about that trying to be your

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
own detective right there so i'm peeling

161
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
these potatoes you guys

162
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
um keep your you know keep your fats a

163
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
little low if you want

164
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
on the lower side you can do some great

165
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
healing but make sure you get enough

166
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
calories though

167
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
if you take away fats because fats are

168
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
so high in calorie

169
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
that's another reason why you might feel

170
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,440
some fatigue you take fats away

171
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,720
they're so high in calories it's why

172
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
everybody gets fat

173
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,440
they get stagnant sluggish livers and

174
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
they gain all this weight from fat

175
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
fat all the fat they're eating right

176
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
once you take that away you better have

177
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,240
some calories are you doing enough fruit

178
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,160
are you

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
you're also getting fat from every food

180
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,919
i mean fats are in every

181
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,160
single food anyway but those are just

182
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,440
more radical fats more radical fats when

183
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
you're doing too many of those so let's

184
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,680
do this

185
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,840
so i got a pan going right now

186
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
so i'm going to steam some potatoes i'm

187
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
going to steam these up for the

188
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,880
cauliflower mash

189
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,680
it's what we're doing cutting them in

190
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,680
little pieces here

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,440
rosie says i have i have lime

192
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,960
time four times i had lime four times

193
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,280
and i've had vertigo and

194
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
ra so here's how it works with

195
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
rheumatoid arthritis

196
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
that's caused by epstein-barr i talk

197
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,199
about that in medical medium books

198
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
vertigo is caused by epstein-barr okay

199
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,080
lyme disease is caused by epstein-barr

200
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,560
you see how it works

201
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,280
lyme disease is just an inflammation

202
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,600
marker

203
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
they don't actually find your lyme

204
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,759
bacteria

205
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
they just they're testing for

206
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
inflammation

207
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
and then they place the name of the

208
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,960
bacteria on the test

209
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,599
it's criminal but that's what they do

210
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,120
so what happens is but your real

211
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,080
symptoms are epstein-barr

212
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,759

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,960
you get all the vertigo and you get all

246
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280

265
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,839
jane robinson what treatment do you

266
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,600
suggest for

267
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,399
uh him necrosis my friend gets one pint

268
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,399
of blood drawn every month and i'm now

269
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
realizing that doesn't sound good after

270
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,080
listening to you

271
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,279
well look that's a viral issue so what

272
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,560
happens is

273
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,800
um when viruses

274
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,279
um when viruses uh get into the spleen

275
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
okay and they get into the liver and

276
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,120
they even get into the bone

277
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,959
marrow when viruses get in in there we

278
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
can get that condition

279
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,480
and then what they do is they try to you

280
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,160
know they drain a pint

281
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
continuously to try to deal with it but

282
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,200
all the deficiencies happen all these

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
other things so

284
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
it's a matter of like how do we also

285
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
help with the deficiencies how do we go

286
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
after the viral issue and get that

287
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,600
better so

288
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,360
we get better and um and that's that's a

289
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
big part of it there it's about

290
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,720
going after the real problem that's a

291
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,680
band-aid you know they try to

292
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
keep things in check by doing that but i

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,760
mean look

294
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
the doctor knows best for what's going

295
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
on right there but what i would

296
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,399
recommend

297
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
if it was a family member or a friend of

298
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,519
mine if it was happening to me

299
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,360
it was happening to me i'd be getting

300
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,760
the books i'd be learning about the

301
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,760
viral conditions and then once you start

302
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,440
eating the right foods for the for the

303
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,760
viral issues once you start taking the

304
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,160
right supplements for the viral issues

305
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
then all of a sudden that starts getting

306
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,200
better and better and better and then

307
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,720
when it gets better

308
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
then they don't have to drain the pint

309
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,760
during the pint train the pipe

310
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,279
pine you know so anyway here is potato

311
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,279
cauliflower

312
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,720
mash right here that's what i'm making i

313
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
don't know if you guys can see it

314
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240

side of my head i got a little pain here

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,399

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,480
feel kind of fatigue you've got lyme

337
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,480
disease you go into a lime doctor's

338
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,920
office boom you leave with a lime stamp

339
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,320

that's how it works um so

343
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,880
but really all those symptoms if you go

344
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,519
into a multiple sclerosis doctor you'll

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
get

346
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,640
a mess tag most likely you go into just

347
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,480
an autoimmune specialist

348
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,680

right but they'll say you got something

352
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,560
because they'll be like and they'll pick

353
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
an autoimmune disease that you have

354
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
it doesn't mean if the label is right or

355
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,920
not maybe they'll just say autoimmune

356
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
but any kind of neurological symptoms

357
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,639
now you just get tagged autoimmune

358
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,959
tagged

359
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680

he's going to take blood right and i

416
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,639
talk about in the podcast episode

417
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
too much blood and it all gets thrown

418
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
away why does it matter

419
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,959
that's your immune system that's your

420
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,519
immune system right there there's a

421
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,160
white blood cell your cbc goes out the

422
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,000
window

423
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,560
okay and when you lose your white count

424
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
now you get sicker and sicker and sicker

425
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
you know

426
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
and i'm noticing blood draws are causing

427
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,120
problem

428
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,399
problems with women that already dealing

429
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
with immune

430
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,600
problems they got symptoms issues they

431
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,760
got

432
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
maybe they got chronic eti's bladder

433
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,399
infections interstitial cystitis

434
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,320
maybe they got other issues chronic

435
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
sinusitis migraines

436
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,199
um uh weakness in limbs or just fatigue

437
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,959
anxiety depression and the body's immune

438
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,560
system is already under stress we're

439
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,320
already under stress and then

440
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,240
we get all this blood drawn when they

441
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
don't have to draw that much they can

442
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,639
draw

443
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,079
half vials they can draw less and then

444
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,440
separate the tests but you got to hear

445
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,440
the podcast episode

446
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
and then the immune system goes out the

447
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,760
window out the window out the window

448
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
your cvc goes out the window and then

449
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,279
your bones have to

450
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,360
go into overload and hopefully in three

451
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,160
four weeks you get your immune system

452
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
back

453
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,839
by the time it comes back you're already

454
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
not feeling that good so now you're

455
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
going to another doctor and then they

456
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
take blood again

457
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,800
and then the vicious cycle keeps on

458
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
going and going going

459
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,639
unless it usually takes months to

460
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,760
recover your blood back

461
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,800
your bone marrow takes time to actually

462
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,839
recover recover takes a long time

463
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
so very important to know i'm reading

464
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,320
the

465
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,680
lyme disease book right here so i'm

466
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,959
looking at it

467
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,360
and lyme disease book medical medium

468
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,759
new edition okay talking about lime in

469
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,959
here i got potatoes cauliflower steaming

470
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,920
we're talking about blood draws talking

471
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,639
about lyme disease talking about

472
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,040
neurological symptoms a little bit too

473
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,800
laura says the bloodletting show wow

474
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,360
that in chemtrails

475
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,800
that chemtrail show so disturbing but

476
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,600
grateful to know

477
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
what can i do to help my son is on a

478
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,880
regular

479
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,839
blood draw schedule he believes it's

480
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,000
necessary

481
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
because doctor says so you can still be

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,800
on a regular blood draw schedule

483
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
absolutely great doctor do the blood

484
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,279
work

485
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,800
but will he learn what to ask the doctor

486
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,279
because you can get your doctor to work

487
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
with you on that instead of taking seven

488
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
vials

489
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,639
full vials maybe you can talk to the

490
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,680
doctor and the doctor will take

491
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,519
three and a half full vials or

492
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,639
seven half vials so the podcast explains

493
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,360
all about it

494
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,120
um and no you lori you heard the podcast

495
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,199
you totally get it

496
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
well listen it's his doctor he just does

497
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,000

498
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
you know listen to the doctor totally

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,680

501
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
i'm not but if i

502
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,199
was that's what i would do i would i

503
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,880
would

504
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,279

505
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,800
what's in the the podcast myself

506
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,759

512
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,240
posa when i had tubal pregnancy

513
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
i had to have blood draw every day

514
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,439
that's what they do

515
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,959
that's what they do they do that so

516
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,480
we'll talk about pregnancy right now for

517
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,839
a second

518
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,839
so i want to talk about that

519
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,760
so here you are a mommy and you got a

520
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,839
baby

521
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,839
right and

522
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,120
you're getting your blood drawn every

523
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,559
single day okay

524
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,120
now if we're all supposed to be about

525
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,480
energy um vibrations frequency

526
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,520
frequencies

527
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,559
um sensitivities

528
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,160
if we're also worried about

529
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,039
subtle energies different variables in

530
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,120
life

531
00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:00,080
and blood is being drawn from mommy

532
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,520
continuously or even partially just

533
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,320
maybe sometimes right when you're

534
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,280
pregnant

535
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,679
and i have known a lot of pregnant women

536
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,000
that get a lot of blood drawn

537
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,360
a lot and what happens is that no one

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,480
realizes

539
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,440
but it's stressful on the baby

540
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,640
okay because the baby can sense

541
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,480
everything that's happening inside mommy

542
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,440
everything every word mommy says okay

543
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
everything mommy does everything daddy

544
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
does

545
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,960
all right the baby picks up on voices

546
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,280
the baby picks up on energy

547
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,039
the baby picks up on stress so if mom is

548
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,360
stressed out

549
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,440
the baby picks up on it so when mom gets

550
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,640
a needle jammed in her

551
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,919
and mom's adrenals are flooding they're

552
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,160
just like

553
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,160
because you got the needle the baby

554
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,760
picks up on all that adrenaline surge

555
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,600
that adrenaline surge

556
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,799
if mom's in a bad mood and had a really

557
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,120
bad day

558
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,720
or there's a disagreement somewhere

559
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,960
something's happening

560
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,600
confrontation the baby's gonna pick that

561
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,760
up all that energy right

562
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,360
so what happens is with the blood draw

563
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,320
they take way too much blood from

564
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,480
pregnant women

565
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,640
they think pregnant women have plenty to

566
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,960
spare lots more blood

567
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
and lots of spare i think that's

568
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,080
probably one of the big

569
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,520
big biggest mistakes with everything

570
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,799
especially in blood draw

571
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,880
it just shows you that research in

572
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,720
science is so far behind and antiquated

573
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,919
and there's broken pieces of it in the

574
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,240
system you know

575
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,320
broken broken aspects of it and this is

576
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,880
a big one right here when it comes down

577
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,320
to

578
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,559
pregnancies first of all

579
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,000
a mommy's immune system is already

580
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,160
looking after the baby

581
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,360
because the baby doesn't have the baby's

582
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,600
own immune system yet

583
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,600
very important to know so mommy's immune

584
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,480
system has to look

585
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,679
after the baby so when mommy's getting

586
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,000
blood draw all the time when pregnant

587
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,799
that's mommy's immune system but that's

588
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,799
the baby's immune system disappearing

589
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,280
baby's immune system is disappearing

590
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
baby's immune system is disappearing

591
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,799
because mommy's immune system is the

592
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,480
baby's immune system

593
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,360
and um and it just doesn't recuperate

594
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,120
instantly like the the mommy's immune

595
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,039
system doesn't just all of a sudden oh

596
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,240
it's fixed it's great it's all set

597
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,080
now we're fine that's that's not reality

598
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,799
that's not how it works

599
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,240
so the baby feels all this so really

600
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,159
what they should be doing now here's the

601
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,360
problem you might be thinking well hey

602
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,480
what a bad guy i am because i'm trying

603
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,320
to tell

604
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,080
pregnant women not to get blood tests

605
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,679
and the system no that's not at all

606
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
i want pregnant women to get their blood

607
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
tested if that's what the doctor wants

608
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,000
totally on board but they throw all the

609
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
blood away so as i showed you guys and

610
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
demonstrated

611
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
a drop of blood is all they use in each

612
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
test

613
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,120
they throw all that blood away so why

614
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,880
are they putting mommy under stress

615
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
removing her immune system a big part of

616
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,919
her immune system

617
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,039
risking the baby's life with these blood

618
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,039
draws

619
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,640
and the in the protecting the baby when

620
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,000
they're throwing away all the blood

621
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,559
when you think about that this is really

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,520
scary

623
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,520
right um

624
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,840

625
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,000

thinks causes lyme disease and

659
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
there's the little tick right here so

660
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360

yourself

679
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,159
seriously it's that important let's

680
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,200
travel back in time for a moment to

681
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,720
november 1975 when multiple children and

682
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,120
young adults were developing

683
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360
symptoms which alerted doctors to launch

684
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,080
an investigation in the area around lyme

685
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,320
connecticut

686
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,440
that gave lyme disease its name lime

687
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
first let's remind ourselves of the

688
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,799
technology

689
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,720
back then rotary phones

690
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,679
let's go there rotary phones

691
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,360
so they knew the causal lime back then

692
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,919
in 1975

693
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,679
when they didn't know what causes any

694
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
chronic illness but they knew what

695
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
caused

696
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,440
lyme disease interesting well okay

697
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,320
think about the technology back then uh

698
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,080
uh

699
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,279
there's a fire there's a fire

700
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,720
okay there's a fire

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,760
technology is so really it's so good

706
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
back then

707
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,039

know why lyme disease is lyme disease

721
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,760
back then when they don't even know why

722
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,799

right to get all these kids sick

732
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,159
medical research and science didn't know

733
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,440
what was wrong with anybody with chronic

734
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,760
illness and they still

735
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,440

771
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,360
so anyway in the medical world kids were

772
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,880
getting their tonsils plucked out like

773
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,159

kids tonsils were swelling they still

776
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,120
don't know why now but wait a minute

777
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
technology was so advanced back then we

778
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,200
might have to make

779
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,440

796
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
i mean that's that's what we're looking

797
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,960
at

798
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,960
let's keep on going

799
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,679
even today there's no clinical

800
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,200
understanding of what's behind

801
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,760
tonsillitis technology

802
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,279
has made leaps and bounds yeah right

803
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,880
your phone's better

804
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,200
but everybody's still sick everybody's

805
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,600
still

806
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,120
sick you mean to tell me signs of

807
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,039
research didn't fix everybody in the

808
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,000
last 40 years

809
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,039
uh rose theresa we had 9-1-1 in 1975

810
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
really because not

811
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,399
i think everywhere in the united states

812
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,080
had it

813
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,200
um but i'm glad you told me

814
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,039
rose thanks for being here awesome

815
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,480
um well it looked maybe we did have

816
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,520
9-1-1 on there

817
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,360
out there in 1975. i just remember

818
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,760
i think in 1981 i think is when

819
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,880
where i live we had 9-1-1 it was in the

820
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,360
80s

821
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,320
early 80s anyway there's no clinical

822
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,919
understanding of what's behind

823
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,120
tonsillitis while technology has made

824
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,279
leaps and bounds

825
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,320
we still don't know why everybody's sick

826
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,159
and they still don't know why

827
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,640
everybody's sick today

828
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:05,679
there we are nope we did not have 9-1-1

829
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,440
katherine i i i didn't think we did

830
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,000
um yeah we didn't have tammy says we

831
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,159
didn't have 9-1-1 no we didn't

832
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,880
okay we're sim i don't even know if we

833
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,559
had it in 1981-911 maybe i'm wrong but

834
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,240
it could have been like 1989

835
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,559
were symptoms that have been seen okay

836
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,840
so there were symptoms that were seen

837
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,440
for decades before the lyme symptoms

838
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,720
appeared you guys

839
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,399
all right and somehow in this area

840
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,080
the illness was treated as something new

841
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,240
and recognizable

842
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,919
it most likely because of compassionate

843
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,840
doctors they were trying to get to the

844
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,200
bottom of a problem

845
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,880
okay so all around the world

846
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,440
everybody was suffering from these same

847
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
symptoms but they for some reason

848
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,720
thought these symptoms started

849
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,799
in lime right

850
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,799
so townspeople began looking for a

851
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,600
culprit and they landed on the deer tick

852
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,880
deer tick you guys right the deer tick

853
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,760
okay

854
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
so the deer tick

855
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,600
um but back then wait we had 9-1-1

856
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,840
back in 97 i would probably say not in

857
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,360
the entire country very small areas if

858
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,720
there ever was

859
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,720
i mean i didn't have 9-1-1 and 75 no way

860
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,440
um so it landed on the deer tick because

861
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,399
one of the patients reported seeing a

862
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,520
tick a few

863
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,279
weeks before he fell ill

864
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,279
that's like a train derailing for

865
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,520
reasons unknown and a passenger

866
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,600
mentioning a deer he saw grazing 50

867
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,200
miles back the clues didn't add up

868
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,320
so so you had a few people that were

869
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,480
sick they had some fatigue

870
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:52,880
a few you know and uh jerry says 9-1-1

871
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,720
started 1976 but only for 17

872
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,679
of the country right yeah i mean 1975

873
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,240
it wasn't there right but 76 it started

874
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,000
i don't think it got to

875
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,279
i don't think it got to we're up you

876
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,320
know where i was until

877
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,080
a long time so yeah

878
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,840
see you guys the whole thing with the

879
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,360
tick comes down to this

880
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,720
right so a deer tick

881
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,080
right was seen a few weeks

882
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,320
before okay someone got some lyme

883
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,840
symptoms right

884
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,240
during the summer right and

885
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,399
but that's that's not enough evidence

886
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,640
it's just not enough evidence

887
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,480
a deer tick is not enough evidence so

888
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,799
the culprit became all the deer

889
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,080
and that's what everybody focused on it

890
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,840
was all

891
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:49,760
sharon said connecticut 9-1-1 1981

892
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:53,519
so andrea says the nation's first 9-1-1

893
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,960
call was placed on february 16 1968

894
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,039
and haleyville alabama california state

895
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
statewide system initially launched in

896
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,799
1972

897
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,679
but wasn't fully completed until 1985.

898
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,080
yeah

899
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,440
i i remember most people getting like

900
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,559
911 by like 1989

901
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,919
somewhere around that yeah

902
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,679
yeah and in connecticut was 1981 yeah

903
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,120
it's 1975 right just this wasn't around

904
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,720
it's it's isn't it interesting all

905
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,120
that's interesting

906
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
so the deer was blamed for lyme disease

907
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,360
okay no proof

908
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,080
they never found the bacteria in a tick

909
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
ever

910
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,640
just so you know i'm letting you guys

911
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,240
know they never found bacteria in a tick

912
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,919
they never found the borrelia

913
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,519
never found the bartonella in a tick

914
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,960
ever never did

915
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:45,679
never did but um

916
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,039
diana loves the visuals it helps right

917
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,240
you guys i'm steaming up potatoes

918
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,519
cauliflower making the

919
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,600
potato cauliflower mash so

920
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,039
the point all of this is and i'm gonna

921
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,039
keep on going here

922
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,760
karen says crazy that they name the

923
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,240
cause of lime from deer tick

924
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,760
how did how scientific is that haha

925
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:11,840
exactly that's how it works

926
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,840
so get back to this a little bit

927
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,320
going back a little bit more okay 1981 a

928
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
doctor announced he discovered the

929
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,640
missing link a bacterium named

930
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,240
borrelia that the ticks passed along to

931
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,360
humans through their bites

932
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,640
they never found the tick that had the

933
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,760
borrelia

934
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,039
never found that but it was a theory is

935
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,200
what it was

936
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,120
he was lauded for his discovery which

937
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,360
led to a series of bacteria focused

938
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,080
tested treatments for lyme disease

939
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,120
which started the process of destroying

940
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,120
a lot of lives

941
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,480
it was the perfect out for the medical

942
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,120
authorities no one liked

943
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
ticks anyway do you guys like ticks no

944
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,640
one likes ticks

945
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,919
everybody hates ticks molly what do you

946
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,159
take tests why do

947
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
ticks test positive but then when they

948
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,600
say they're positive with lyme

949
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,519
they're not tested positive with

950
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,880
borrelia or bartonella

951
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,919
um not at all they're te if people are

952
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,720
tested

953
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,200
for inflammation that's how it's worked

954
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,720
so

955
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,879
your blood gets removed and that blood

956
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,760
gets tested with inflammation markers

957
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,399
kind of like the a

958
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,960
a anti-nuclear antigen test if you if

959
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:25,839
you show an elevation of inflammation

960
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,560
the the lyme lab puts the bacteria name

961
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,359
along with

962
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,919
it they don't find the bacteria in your

963
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,040
blood

964
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,560
they never did isn't that sad and

965
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,560
when you learn the truth about lyme

966
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,399
disease might really get you upset

967
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,720
because you wonder why is there so many

968
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,960
devious sinister

969
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,960
corrupt situations in chronic illness

970
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,720
why there just is for a lot of reasons

971
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,560
one was to sell billions of dollars of

972
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,720
antibiotics actually more than billions

973
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,520
of dollars antibiotics now so we got 50

974
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,760
years

975
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,800
of lyme disease for whatever it is now

976
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,720
40 years 40 plus years of lyme disease

977
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,079
and with that 40 plus years of lyme

978
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
disease they've sold a lot of

979
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,680
antibiotics

980
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
and that's a big part of why it's done

981
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,839
it was a perfect doubt

982
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
metal meta the medical authorities no

983
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,880
one liked

984
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,960
ticks anyway and the theory of a

985
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,800
tick-borne illness fed into the fear of

986
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,720
nature already present in society

987
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,240
medical authorities felt they could give

988
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,400
up on digging for an answer

989
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,920
so let's not dig for an answer anymore

990
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,440
let's stop looking

991
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,960
let's stop looking it must have been

992
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,920
that tick

993
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,839
meanwhile the world was suffering from

994
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,599
the same symptoms

995
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,079
and much of the world all the people

996
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,599
weren't around ticks ticks were only in

997
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,280
certain areas of the world

998
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,359
but yet there were lots of areas of the

999
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,000
world where there were no ticks no one

1000
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,520
saw a tick

1001
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,920
no one ever had a tick bite in their

1002
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,680
life their family members never had to

1003
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,359
take bite in their life but they were

1004
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,079
sick with these symptoms see how it

1005
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,680
works

1006
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,000
it's interesting unfortunately all these

1007
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,880
tick

1008
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
discoveries were wrong this is what you

1009
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,599
won't hear

1010
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,960
anywhere else lyme disease is not caused

1011
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,640
by ticks

1012
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,720
and lyme disease is not caused by

1013
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,400
borrelia

1014
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,680
and this broke lyme disease the world of

1015
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
lyme disease is back

1016
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,680
is this book doctors are now treating

1017
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,760
lyme disease differently

1018
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,280
they're treating lyme disease with cat's

1019
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,560
claw

1020
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,520
right anti-viral treating lyme disease

1021
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,000
with cat's cloth

1022
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
now doctors check for reactivated

1023
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,720
epstein-barr when they're

1024
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,880
searching for lyme disease so they all

1025
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,400
test patients now for epstein-barr

1026
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,200
because of this book

1027
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,079
so now doctors are checking for

1028
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,240
epstein-barr

1029
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,320
when they're looking for lime that's why

1030
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,400
you hear uh yeah i got diagnosed with

1031
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,320
lime and epstein barr

1032
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,320
i got diagnosed with lyme and

1033
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,839
epstein-barr

1034
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,000
i got diagnosed with lyme disease at

1035
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,880
epstein-barr

1036
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,359
everybody gets diagnosed now with ebv

1037
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,079
now

1038
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,760
doctors never thought epstein-barr did

1039
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,200
anything besides gave you motto and went

1040
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,079
away but the book

1041
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,079
taught on how it's reactivated so this

1042
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,839
is the first book in the world that

1043
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,960
taught everybody that epstein-barr

1044
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,000
gets reactivated and causes real

1045
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
symptoms

1046
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,760
because they used to think epstein-barr

1047
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,520
just went away now we've changed the

1048
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,839
world of lyme disease including adding

1049
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,240
cat's claw into the

1050
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,839
regimen which is really amazing

1051
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,280
so does anything happen when you're

1052
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,680
bitten by a tick yes

1053
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,920
good call good question let's talk about

1054
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,280
that for a second

1055
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,880
all right so i'm sitting here minding my

1056
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,119
own business right

1057
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,000
and that tick gets you and it gets on

1058
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,400
your neck

1059
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
and you're like what the heck what is

1060
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,320
this

1061
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,960
honey is that a tick take a look in the

1062
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,040
mirror

1063
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,000
is that a tick that's a tick right get

1064
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,160
the tweezers wait

1065
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,359
you're not supposed to squeeze it right

1066
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,880
you're not supposed to squeeze it with

1067
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,800
the tweezers you're supposed to try to

1068
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,920
pluck it out so you don't squeeze the

1069
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,839
bacteria back into you right so you're

1070
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,280
not supposed to squeeze the bacteria

1071
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,079
back into you right

1072
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
um okay we'll just try to get a careful

1073
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,599
ow

1074
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,880
ow you got the tick oh no the legs are

1075
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,040
left in me

1076
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,920

neck

1078
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,640
ow ow and what happens is

1079
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,000
when anything's left in you from an

1080
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,359
insect

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,160
it's called the bite it happens when a

1084
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,119

is what you're gonna have spider bite

1094
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,839
if the venom's in you or a little bit of

1095
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,920
particles

is still in you the little bit of the

1101
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,320
head you're going to get a bull's eye

1102
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,320
yeah you can get an infection if it's

1103
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,480
not cleaned up and addressed and a lot

1104
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,880
of people the head of the tick stays in

1105
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,960
turns into an infection but that's a

1106
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,400
staph infection

1107
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,560
that's a staph infection

1108
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,800
that's not borrelia that's a staph

1109
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,440
infection right there

1110
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,040
that head of the tick stays in your neck

1111
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,880
that tick gets pulled out

1112
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,880
that's a staph infection

1113
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,359
so many holes in the lyme disease thing

1114
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,839
it's so sad

1115
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,839
it's so sad so let's keep on talking

1116
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,920
book explains all this you guys got to

1117
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,320
read the lime chapter

1118
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
it explains all the triggers okay and

1119
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
i'll go over the triggers a little bit

1120
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,000
with you too

1121
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:00,079
in a second

1122
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,760
so let's go just a little bit

1123
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,079
when the research was taking place in

1124
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,599
the 1970s and 1980s you'd suppose

1125
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,760
researchers would have realized the

1126
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,200
problem was happening nationwide and

1127
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,280
globally

1128
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,200
and today you think someone would would

1129
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
have wake up and realize that hundreds

1130
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,960
of thousands of people who have never

1131
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,800
been near a deer tick receive lyme

1132
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,520
disease diagnosis right

1133
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,040
so think about science and research for

1134
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,560
a minute just think about this you guys

1135
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,760
i'm serious okay

1136
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,880
this is serious right a few kids

1137
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,400
came down with aches and pains

1138
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,480
fatigue right think about this

1139
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,720
some compassionate doctors wanted to

1140
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,280
know what's going on

1141
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:47,680
okay research in science

1142
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,680
did not pick up the phone

1143
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,960
and call other states to see if kids

1144
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,079
were dealing with the same thing

1145
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,760
i'm going to say it again how screwed up

1146
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,079
is this

1147
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,680
famous research and science

1148
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,960
godly research and science top doctors

1149
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,319
of harvard

1150
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,800
top doctors of yale doctor top best

1151
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,400
doctors on the planet

1152
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,840
research in science didn't pick up the

1153
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,319
god damn phone

1154
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,359
[Laughter]

1155
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,880
right a friend of mine's grandmother

1156
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,079
said that the other day

1157
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,160
she said are you going to be talking

1158
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,200
about lyme disease

1159
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,720
and then she said those damn tics

1160
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,400
i said i said there's not the ticks

1161
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,960
it's like 92. i said it's not the ticks

1162
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,920
all right they could have picked up the

1163
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,440
phone

1164
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,480
and called anybody else in this

1165
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,880
any state in in the country they could

1166
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,800
have

1167
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,400
called overseas but that's right

1168
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
technology i don't think you could make

1169
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,640
an overseas phone call

1170
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,720
with this could you i highly doubt it

1171
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,200
what someone lives in the uk

1172
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,040
uh never gonna talk to him ever because

1173
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,800
this thing's not gonna get there well it

1174
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,119
is probably it probably would reach him

1175
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,480
the point is though is that they could

1176
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,760
have called anybody

1177
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,160
anywhere around the world and said are

1178
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,319
you

1179
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,240
having problems is there any kids

1180
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,200
entering your hospital with fatigue and

1181
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,079
aches and pains

1182
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,640
how about your town how about your city

1183
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,240
but that

1184
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,720
shows you research and science is so bad

1185
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,160
and was so bad then and guess what you

1186
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,880
think they fixed it

1187
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,560
you think research and science was fixed

1188
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,040
like it's fixed right

1189
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,920
it's fixed the only thing they fixed it

1190
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,319
with now

1191
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,280
is research in science focuses on the

1192
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,160
matcha tea

1193
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,200
that's it that's it they focus on matcha

1194
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,119
tea

1195
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,800
women are laying in their beds can't

1196
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,160
function can't drive cars

1197
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,400
crippling anxiety aches and pains total

1198
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,079
sickness every there's all the different

1199
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,400
conditions we have

1200
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,079
and they're focused on machete once

1201
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,480
again that's what research of science

1202
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,920
did

1203
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,760
they first of all they tried to help out

1204
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,319
three kids back then in 1975

1205
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,119
said well it must be lyme disease that's

1206
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,040
what they said

1207
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,280
right they never found a bacteria in a

1208
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,960
tick they came out with a theory

1209
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,960
but completely bombarded hundreds of

1210
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,200
thousands of women and children with

1211
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,880
antibiotics ruining their lives all

1212
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,560
through the late 70s

1213
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,200
80s 90s 2000s and all they had to do was

1214
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:33,680
make a phone call and realize

1215
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,359
that if everywhere around the world they

1216
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,480
were suffering from the same symptoms

1217
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,839
that maybe

1218
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:44,880
it wasn't a tick

1219
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:49,440
it's actually sick demented

1220
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,440
when you think about it so that's how it

1221
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,160
works

1222
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,480
yeah so anyway i'm just giving you guys

1223
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,000
the rundown

1224
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,520
um all right uh elena says i found a

1225
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,960
tick of my apartment about six months

1226
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,160
ago my god i freaked out

1227
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,280
so bad we called exterminator

1228
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,599
sprayed all this stuff all over

1229
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,200
poor thing didn't even die so we sprayed

1230
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,560
again

1231
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,680
um if it was me i would not

1232
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,240
do the sprays i wouldn't do the sprays

1233
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,480
they won't kill really the bugs the bugs

1234
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,480
will keep on coming back and all you do

1235
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,119
is you're just spraying yourself

1236
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,599
so of course you can spray if you like

1237
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,119
to

1238
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,560
i'm not trying to tell you different i'm

1239
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,839
not trying to take i'm just saying if it

1240
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,000
was me

1241
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,880
i just would i don't think i'd be doing

1242
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,880
all that spraying

1243
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,480

1311
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,839
but i'm watching a lot of people get

1312
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,240
sick so i decided to make it all about

1313
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,160
the platform for now and like if i got

1314
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,640
this little platform then let me

1315
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,440
make sure you guys can just i gotta just

1316
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,040
scream

1317
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,319
i gotta scream scream to top my lungs so

1318
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,359
i can try to protect you guys with

1319
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,119
everything i got because i've been

1320
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:27,440
telling you about the blood draws but

1321
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,599
i don't think everybody's been hearing

1322
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,599
it

1323
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,960
all right lyme disease symptoms the

1324
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,079
confusion about lyme disease symptoms is

1325
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,240
vast

1326
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,920
vast at this point every autoimmune

1327
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,240
disease or mystery illness in this book

1328
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,680
and in existence has symptoms that have

1329
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,160
been linked to lyme disease

1330
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,079
every single autoimmune symptom out

1331
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,800
there can be linked to lyme disease

1332
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,920
and lyme disease is not bacteria and i'm

1333
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,880
going to talk about that

1334
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,240
lyme disease is viral so it's viral

1335
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,480
that's the difference so

1336
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:06,800
here's a bacteria okay

1337
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:10,319
here's a virus bacteria

1338
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,839
virus bacteria doesn't

1339
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:17,359
pee and poop out a neurotoxin

1340
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:21,119
okay viruses

1341
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:23,200
release a neurotoxin neurological lyme

1342
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,559
and every other neurological symptom

1343
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,880
people deal with

1344
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,000
is caused by viruses releasing a

1345
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,160
neurotoxin

1346
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,839
bacteria doesn't lyme is not bacteria

1347
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,839
just not

1348
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,079
autoimmune is viral and you can get a

1349
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,680
lyme diagnosis if you're autoimmune in a

1350
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,160
heartbeat go to a lyme doctor you got

1351
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,760
your lyme diagnosis

1352
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,599
and guess what he's going to be testing

1353
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,480
for epstein-barr because of medical

1354
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,880
medium

1355
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,240
millions of books going around thousands

1356
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,079
of doctors

1357
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,359
with the books they're testing for

1358
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,760
epstein-barr now

1359
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,440
they say lyme because the blind the lyme

1360
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,839
lab won't let go

1361
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,640
the lime lab they won't let go they

1362
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:11,359
don't want to say they were wrong

1363
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,920
they don't because if they say they were

1364
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,200
wrong

1365
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,119
all this time they're going to look

1366
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,680
really bad so they have to keep

1367
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,079
what they're doing even though it's

1368
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,079
viral

1369
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:29,760
why do blood draws kill over time

1370
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,880
because severe deficiencies too much

1371
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,319
blood being drawn

1372
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,319
and when you're sick with lyme disease

1373
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,119
like neurological lyme you're fighting a

1374
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,200
virus

1375
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,880
and as your immune system gets pulled

1376
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,240
out of you and pulled out of you pulled

1377
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,800
out of you you get weaker and weaker and

1378
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,200
weaker

1379
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,559
a lot of women have died with chronic

1380
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,319
illness

1381
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,079
because they lost their immune system

1382
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,440
over time they lost the battle to

1383
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,040
viruses

1384
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,480
because their blood kept on being drawn

1385
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,000
drawn drawn now i want you to go to the

1386
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,880

i saw dr faun here he's here tonight

1403
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,040

two mds incredible mds

1407
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,880
look nobody knew about the blood draw

1408
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,240
thing it's medical medium had to

1409
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,359
you know get the cannonball out

1410
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,880
uh dr faun per mm the tick doesn't have

1411
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:49,280
the virus

1412
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,559
the bite triggers the ebb thank you for

1413
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,160
clarifying that

1414
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:56,079
thank you thank you thank you so

1415
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,160
the tick doesn't carry the epstein-barr

1416
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,760
virus or the shingles virus or the hhv

1417
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,640
six of the side of that megalovirus the

1418
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,359
tick

1419
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,400
right bites you right take bites you

1420
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,040
whatever

1421
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,079
the tick bites you and then you get

1422
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,680
triggered because

1423
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,400
the tick bite can lower the immune

1424
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,680
system especially if a little bit of

1425
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,400
a little bit of the proteins from

1426
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,040
the bite or the tick's head really the

1427
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,040
tick's head

1428
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,880
pieces of the tick's head get lodged in

1429
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,240
everybody that's how it's done

1430
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,280
and that lowers the immune system

1431
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,599
mc says i'm not a doctor but i'm here

1432
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,280

yeah that could be a trigger too just

1456
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,400
bug bites can be triggers for a lot of

1457
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,200
people that are sensitive and immune

1458
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,280
systems down

1466
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,400

i got some medicalmedium.com i got

1468
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,520
kitchen stuff

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,640
at medicalmedium.com the directory if

1470
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,240
you ever look for stuff

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,920
right now i was just doing it this way

1472
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,599
it seemed to be just a kind of a fun

1473
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,599
easy way to do it right now

1474
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,839
so i'm getting all these potatoes and

1475
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:29,680
cauliflower in this pan

1476
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,119
um

1477
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,520
the reason why i'm talking about lyme

1478
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,760
disease today

1479
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,760
is because by the way we're live youtube

1480
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,000
live facebook right now

1481
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,960
i talk i'm talking about it because i

1482
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,559
think the people with

1483

01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,200
disease protocols a little bit i just

1709
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,400
made this beautiful meal

1710
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,760
i'm excited about that meal go back to

1711
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,359
lime for a little bit i have the lyme

1712
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,400
disease protocols in here you can check

1713
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,599
out these protocols

1714
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,559
so i just want to give you a rundown

1715
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:21,839
real quick show it to you and then

1716
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,839
there it is lyme disease boom

1717
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,599
balabi hi mm what are your thoughts on

1718
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,720
ticks carrying a parasite that lives

1719
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,720
inside

1720
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:38,640
the lime well my thoughts are this

1721
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:42,240
okay i can tell you this okay a parasite

1722
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,760
in a tick is not the same thing as

1723
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,839
borrelia in a tick

1724
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,880
and lyme disease neurological symptoms

1725
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,480
so that's important too

1726
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,480
another thing too is there's no

1727
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,319
tick-borne illness that ever caused

1728
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,400
neurological symptoms

1729
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,559
the only tick-borne illness we've ever

1730
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,680
had in the united states or

1731
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:03,280
somewhere else globally has been a

1732
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:06,480
fever but not neurological sickness

1733
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,799
chronic long term so that doesn't exist

1734
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,000
and parasites don't cause chronic

1735
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,880
illness

1736
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,319
parasites don't cause chronic symptoms

1737
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,880
when you get a parasite in your

1738
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,520
intestinal tract you either win the

1739
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,599
battle

1740
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,640
or you lose the battle there's no in

1741
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,440
between

1742
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,640
so when you get a foodborne pathogen

1743
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,559
that's parasitical

1744
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,240
your body throws it up craps it out

1745
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,799
throws it up craps it out throws it up

1746
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,400
craps it out throws it up craps it out

1747
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,240
you're in agony pain you're in the

1748
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,920
hospital you're on painkillers you throw

1749
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,920
it up you crap it out then they drug you

1750
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,280
with more painkillers until you win the

1751
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,000
battle

1752
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,760
and in many cases foodborne illness from

1753
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,520
eating some chicken in a restaurant has

1754
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,160
killed a lot of people and you lose the

1755
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,240
battle

1756
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,000
there's no in between your body won't

1757
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:54,240
live with a parasite inside

1758
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
the gut worms are different though your

1759
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,520
body will live with a worm and you can

1760
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,760
have worms in your liver you can have

1761
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,599
worms in your body

1762
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,520
but the worms don't cause neurological

1763
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,079
symptoms either anyway you guys heading
