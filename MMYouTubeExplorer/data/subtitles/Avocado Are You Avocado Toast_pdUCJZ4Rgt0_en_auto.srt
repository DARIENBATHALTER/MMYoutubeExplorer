you guys to see it right

so you guys learn how some medical

77
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:04,080
professionals were taught to avoid the

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,680
avocado

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,180
in medical school it wasn't first of all

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,920
you guys know in medical school I've

81
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,700
talked to hundreds of doctors over the

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,800
years

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,860
in medical school they didn't teach you

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,840
about food and diet right we know that

85
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,459
and they don't don't get fooled they

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,019
still don't teach it now I don't care

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,180
what any but doctor says I talked to

88
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,879
doctor just graduated recently and said

89
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,500
what they teach about food men and

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,659
everything and diet and I was like oh

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,239
yeah that's really great and lame as

92
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,019
 it was terrible so check this out

93
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,060
right

94
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,860
in medical school right all these years

95
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,260
instead of just teaching about food

96
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,040
which they didn't like having at least

97
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,080
some courses in that Medical University

98
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,599
instead of doing that they said stay

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,659
away from avocado it's toxic it's

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,239
poisonous it's toxic it's bad for you

101
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,340
that's what they said that was the

102
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,340
training I talk about it in the episode

103
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,060
understand why the avocado went from a

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,659
feared food feared man you guys need to

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,700

126
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,280
Mexican restaurant around the corner

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,419

I'm right you gotta hear the podcast

131
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,840
Episode by the way Mexican restaurants

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,759
did not sell guacamole because no one

133
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,880
ate it and no one liked it and no one

134
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,039
cared about it so they wouldn't buy

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,560
avocados and then try to make guacamole

136
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,840
and let it sit and rot when a mama pop

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,020
Mexican restaurant needs to survive

138
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,759
dollars and cents count for survival to

139
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,500
pay the help to keep the restaurant in

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,539
business right

141
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,520
and no one was eating guacamole they

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,139
would make guacamole no one would eat it

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,300

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,000
knocked over everything and he kicked

187
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,160
the avocados down the aisle and he just

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,780
he went crazy because he said they were

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,060
toxic and poisonous and that's what he

190
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,620
learned in Alternative Health you guys

191
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,440
need to know something in alternative

192
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,199
medicine you weren't allowed to touch an

193
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,220
avocado in Chinese medicine

194
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,199
acupuncturists would never allow you to

195
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,240
eat an avocado

196
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,220
that's what it was like and guess what

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,139
no one's held accountable never never

198
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,060
instead everybody's just an expert you

199
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,979
just go with the trendy times and go

200
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,840
along and now you're an expert doesn't

201
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,580
matter what kind of crap you created

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,960
back 10 years ago in your life or 20

203
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,599
years ago and you're like no one's held

204
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,120
accountable at least corrected no one

205
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,460
right and instead they change they morph

206
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,139
like a chameleon they morph like a

207
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,940
chameleon and they shed their skin like

208
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,759
a snake and that's what people do they

209
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,800
shed their skin like a snake oh I was

210
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,259

whole bunch of other people and we'll go

219
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,259

251
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,500
that's what they do right so avocados

252
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,360
right every time I would hold up an

253
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,920
avocado years ago because I've been

254
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,320
doing this for over 30 years every time

255
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,360
I would hold up an avocado

256
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,220
and say this is something you guys

257
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,440
should eat this is something somebody

258
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,399
should eat it was always kicked out of

259
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:12,540
my hand basically it was considered

260
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,459
 legit you guys for real okay it

261
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,200
took a lot of years teaching a lot of

262
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,480
people and you guys know I talk to a lot

263
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,040
of people throughout the decades and how

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,779
to teach that many people in health I

265
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,720
can't tell you how many people that are

266
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,459
actually now people people need options

267
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,779
to get off of other heavy foods and I'm

268
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,120
going to cover that in the next moment

269
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,760
but I want you to know right

270
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,140
that I taught a lot of people in the

271
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,260
health industry that you'd be very

272
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,760
surprised to know right that are older

273
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,220
now

274
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,800
that were staying away from avocado in

275
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,660
the Alternative Health field

276
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,100
that I taught throughout the decades to

277
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,260
do avocados

278
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,880
and to talk about them and to preach

279
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,220
about them and lecture about them and

280
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,720
get the word out that's how much work I

281
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,800
had to do

282
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,380
and right it is what it is

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,300

avocado podcast extremely empowering

286
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,820
knowing how food empowers you and

287
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,279
assists you

288
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,380

289

information thank you with gratitude you

291
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,180
guys I'm making a guacamole but but a

292
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,579
medicinal guacamole see now avocado what

293
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,500
what we're talking about here now what

294
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,959
you'll hear in the podcast episode is

295
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,380
it's an incredible transition food this

296
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,480
is a transition tool this is to get you

297
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,120
off of a bad fat right

298
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,459
is to get you off of a bad fat and in

299
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,140
the episode I talk about how the fat in

300
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,120
an avocado is different and has nothing

301
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,820
to do with Omega-3s sixes and nines and

302
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,019
that whole BS thing it has nothing to do

303
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,959
with that

304
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,700
the fat is a different viscosity it

305
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,680
keeps the blood a little thinner and

306
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,380
that's the reason why it's an incredible

307
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,320
transition tool to get you off of the

308
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,000
bad fats not about Omega-3s and omega-6s

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,380
it's not about that I know the vegan

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,959
doctors are talking about that now

311
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,060
because they have a theory

312
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,420
from studies that always get proven

313
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,620
wrong over and over and over again I

314
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,139
don't know if you guys have ever noticed

315
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,000
that constantly in medicine both

316
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,980
alternative and conventional the

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,899
theories come out the trend goes around

318
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,880
and then it gets debunked and then they

319
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,920
found out it was wasn't even studied it

320
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,079
wasn't even proven and then boom on to a

321
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,120
new Theory then on to a new Theory the

322
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,300
big Theory now is omega-6s are the bad

323
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,339
ones that's the bad ones right so an

324
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,139
avocado has a bag of six in it right but

325
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,760
avocados are still incredible for you

326
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:39,300
right it's always contradicting

327
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,959
contradicting the point is is the fat in

328
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,120
avocado is thinner they don't know that

329
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,880
part science research food science does

330
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,459
not know the avocado fat is thinner the

331
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,279
viscosity is different and because of

332
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:55,800
that and because it has sugar in it with

333
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,620
it combined so it's Nature's way of

334
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,920
putting sugar and fat together the right

335
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,500
way right because of that it's healthier

336
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,980
there's a healthier reason for the that

337
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,139
it's less of a thicker fat it has a

338
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,019
different viscosity it's got a thinner

339
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:14,339
nature to it it allows sugar to do its

340
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,139
thing because there's sugar in the

341
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,380
avocado as well but it's an incredible

342
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,560
transition tool too to getting someone

343
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,720
off of the bacon off of the eggs off of

344
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,639
the dairy products off of the cheese off

345
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,220
of the meat off of all that kind of

346
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,680
stuff the avocado is a transition tool

347
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,300
to get you off of the bad stuff and

348
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,060
that's what I talked about all these

349
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,040
years I'd be like

350
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,860
avocado get rid of that block of cheese

351
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,480
move that block of cheese out and bring

352
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,420
in the avocado

353
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,940
red eye banana aw well avocado combined

354
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,860
with potatoes cause insulin resistance

355
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,440
depends on healthy your liver is okay

356
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,600
all depends on how over the years your

357
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,399
liver's been beaten down stagnant

358
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,260
sluggish any kinds of problems or

359
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,380
anything like that that all depends

360
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,880
there too on your liver so

361
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,440
if you're somebody and you've been

362
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
through a lot with your health you got a

363
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,699
stagnant sluggish liver you've got weak

364
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,920
digestion weak bile reserves you got

365
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,019
weak hydrochloric acid right there

366
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,180
you're all kinds of buggy you've got

367
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,980
pathogens you got toxic heavy metals

368
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,899
you're not well you have a lot of

369
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,339
different diagnoses or problems or maybe

370
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,320
you're just somebody with just weak

371
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,060
digestion and in a liver issue right

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,620
that you don't know about like a

373
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,060
pre-fatty liver and you don't even know

374
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,279
where you're pre-diabetic and you don't

375
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,199
even know it because of your liver then

376
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,480
yeah if you put potato and avocado

377
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:36,720
together it's not the best of the best

378
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,519
because you're putting a you know a

379
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,440
starch and a fat together so when you

380
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,600
put starches and fats together you can

381
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,639
raise your insulin resistance right but

382
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,779
if you gotta if you cleaned up that

383
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,940
liver

384
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,500
right if your liver's clean and it's not

385
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,779
stagnant sluggish and you've got your

386
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,180
bile Reserve strong and you got your you

387
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:55,740
got your hydrochloric acid strong in

388
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,320
your stomach you've got your gastric

389
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,839
glands built up you got your system

390
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,940
working really good and you're not

391
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,680
bombarding yourself with all these bad

392
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,360
fats you're staying off of bacon you're

393
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,800
staying off of ham you're staying off a

394
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,120
baloney you're staying off a butter

395
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:14,220
cheese milk and then you do avocado

396
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,779
with potato you're not going to get the

397
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,279
insulin resistance but if you're

398
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,660
somebody that's you're already that

399
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,339
sensitive and you've been through a lot

400
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,839
and you're trying to and you're move you

401
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,220
know and you're on these other also

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,019
you're doing all these other bad fats

403
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,899
sure you'll just get insulin resistance

404
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,300
because that's what happens

405
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,680
so that's kind of a quick explanation of

406
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,019
that let's start making a guacamole

407
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,120
Renata says I see some people using that

408
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,759
combination as a detox cleansing tool

409
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,519
that's why I'm asking it's not a detox

410
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,320
cleansing tool when you put

411
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,839
a fat

412
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:52,019
right a fat with any kind of starch

413
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,240
right or you put a fat in the diet let's

414
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,560
just take it that down that direction a

415
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
little bit okay now you're talking about

416
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,199
something a little bit more complicated

417
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,800
here it is if you're going to eat fats

418
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:08,699
milk cheese butter eggs nuts nut Butters

419
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:13,860
nut milks avocados right peanut butter

420
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:18,120
oils meat chicken lamb turkey whatever

421
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:22,199
eggs if you eat any fat you can't

422
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,519
cleanse so your body doesn't cleanse or

423
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:30,240
cleanses very little very little if

424
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,579
you're doing a fat right so but it

425
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,680
depends how many fats are you doing and

426
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,759
what kind of fats are you doing right if

427
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,279
you're only doing a little bit of

428
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,800
avocado every other day or a little bit

429
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:43,680
of avocado each week you've got a better

430
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,980
chance of cleansing all in between but

431
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,019
yet avocado is the best fat Source one

432
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,420
of the best tools one of the best fruits

433
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,480
to use if you're trying to cleanse in

434
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,579
between but always know that fats in

435
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,959
general of all kinds stop the body to

436
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,360
cleanse that's why you have to listen to

437
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:02,579
the podcast you guys get a chance listen

438
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,640
to the podcast avocado or you avocado

439
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,339
toast because I talk about how if we

440
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,839
have fats in our system we can't cleanse

441
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,939
and heal and that's why sometimes it's

442
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,039
best not to eat the avocado if you're

443
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,559
sick struggling chronic illness in your

444
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,980
suffering that's when we don't use the

445
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,679
avocado right but it's a great cool to

446
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,660
transition people away from the bad fats

447
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,480
that are really preventing problems get

448
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,179
them on a good fat that's going to help

449
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,220
them transition and that's the

450
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,200
difference Uma Cali that's true avocados

451
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,660
helped me to transition from eating lots

452
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,860
of nuts avocado is much easier to digest

453
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,100
that's exactly what we're talking about

454
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,080
anyway thank you for that really good

455
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,620
wisdom you have

456
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,740
amazing right it's a fruit that's why

457
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,720
it's a fruit and that's why which is

458
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,700
incredible I'm making a medicinal

459
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,679
guacamole that's why I'm here we're

460
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,840
talking about the medical medium podcast

461
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,820
at Apple podcast right

462
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,100
so other stuff you'll know get to know

463
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,080
how the fat from avocado can be used as

464
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,059
a transition tool on the path to other

465
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,740
healing tools right we were just talking

466
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,500
about all of that that's why I wanted to

467
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,660
read that to you okay see how one person

468
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,419
may do good on a lot of avocado why

469
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,640
another person may not how about that

470
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,559
Michael Charles good to see you removing

471
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,780
the fats was the key to healing for me

472
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,700
after six months I brought avocados back

473
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,919
into the evenings

474
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,220
boom boom

475
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,460
thank you brother boom right

476
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,620
okay see what the deal is about omega-6

477
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,720
is understand why the medical media

478
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,840
morning cleanse keeps fats such as

479
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,179
avocado out of your morning routine

480
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,700
so that's a whole nother thing too all

481
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,220
on its own you guys right leave your

482
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,799
green salads fat to use and not to use

483
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,100
and I show you the recipe containing

484
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:56,039
avocado that is a great substitute when

485
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,919
a mom can't breastfeed so that's another

486
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,380
thing too so know that that's in this

487
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,440
episode is it the moms that can't

488
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,860
breastfeed how you can use avocado to

489
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,900
make milk okay and that's the key right

490
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,580
there so I want you guys to see that I'm

491
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,140
gonna make some guacamole right now let

492
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:17,340
me get working on it

493
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:20,580
you guys that's the plan so let's get

494
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:22,820
started we need a bowl first and then I

495
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,660
shall get that bowl now and I am looking

496
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,660
I have one right here

497
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,720
so yeah so I got a nice glass bowl which

498
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,640
I really like for this

499
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,419
I will get another one

500
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,320
let's do that so it's really great

501
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,320
is that

502
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,640
when you listen to this podcast you guys

503
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,260
it's got a lot of good information which

504
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,419
is really good too you know meaning

505
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,539
overall about the avocado in general

506
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,780
that's really helpful too so that's

507
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,780
great

508
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,720
foreign

509
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,120
this is why I like doing live all the

510
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,440
time because I like when things get like

511
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,220
kind of just

512
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,720
strange and messed up all right

513
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,640
I have a bowl

514
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,220
so we're doing some avocado first things

515
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,919
first I always tell everybody and I've

516
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,419
talked about this before too right take

517
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,380
out the butt right here I just want to

518
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,380
show you guys real quick

519
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:29,520
don't let these fall into your avocado

520
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,360
dish right there see that

521
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,419
don't let that fall in whatever you do

522
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,419
because that's hard as a rock for real

523
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:43,260
so if you got company over and Grandma

524
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,240
comes over and she loses she loses a

525
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,740
crown or something because she was

526
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,960
eating your guacamole she's gonna be

527
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,360
like really pissed so you take off those

528
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,460
butts right there if you have them on

529
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,980
there you see so that's really important

530
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,500
all on its own right

531
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,400
another thing too what I do is I'll take

532
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,440
the knife

533
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,580
and I'll just do this like a billion

534
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,039
other people probably do and have right

535
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,960
so I opened it

536
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,240
there you go

537
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,100
that now I don't recommend other people

538
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,480
to do it that way but I always stick the

539
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,340
knife in there like that that's one

540
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,659
thing I do and then I just put it right

541
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,600
here on the counter

542
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:24,179
and I twist it and it pops off so if you

543
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,780
guys see that right there

544
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:31,080
so I'm going to make an herb guacamole

545
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:35,640
but it's very potent with herbs a lot of

546
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,860
herbs this is a medicinal version right

547
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,500
because I like turning this into

548
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,020
medicine and that's the deal with what

549
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm doing my guacamole I like turning

550
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,260
turning it into medicine that's what I

551
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,600
like to do

552
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,220
I like it nice and medicinal

553
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,380
that's the uh

554
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,640
that's the best the best way to do it so

555
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,740
let's make sure we get it in the middle

556
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,240
there

557
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,020
you know and look you got to remember

558
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,640
the harder the avocado is too right

559
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,220
never pull a pit off with your hand on

560
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,799
the knife I'll show you that too so let

561
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,080
me cut a couple of others now

562
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,780
I like making a big one when I make one

563
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,600
so I'm taking another butt off there

564
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,580
I like making a bigger one

565
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,039
now when you guys listen to the episode

566
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,720
there's all kinds of like pieces of

567
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,340
information in there that might just

568
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,799
skip by you it's always good to listen

569
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,260
to these informative podcast episodes

570
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,000
more than once if you get a chance you

571
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,039
know that's always a good thing to do

572
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,919
right

573
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,140
so never pull the pit off of there with

574
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,900
your hand I've seen people do this

575
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,120
and just literally cut their I've seen

576
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,820
cooking shows out there right

577
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,260
over the years or watch a cooking show

578
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,120
or something and I'm like oh what are

579
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,500
they doing what is that and all of a

580
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,940
sudden you see somebody actually do that

581
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,020
and they take their hand and they do

582
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,179
this

583
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,799
you don't want to do it that way you're

584
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,299
you're bound to get cut especially if

585
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,980
you have a really really sharp knife

586
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,900
right I put it on the board just like

587
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,740
that I drop it down like that and I just

588
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,740
give it a click like

589
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,380
if you guys just came on here we're

590
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,140
talking about the medical meme podcast

591
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,240
avocado or you avocado toast I'm making

592
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,980
some guacamole right here so I got a

593
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,679
nice avocado that's a good one there

594
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,059
don't do the real mushy avocados where

595
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,400
they're rotten

596
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:27,000
right if you buy avocados buy them green

597
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,340
buy them green great tip

598
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,740
if you buy them like this there's a

599
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,419
chance that they're bruised they've been

600
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,480
squeezed too many times by people

601
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:39,480
passing by the you know like people drop

602
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,159
them on the ground put them back up

603
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,260
um on the you know on the

604
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,140
you know shelf right there that's what

605
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:49,200
they do so what I recommend is

606
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:52,620
buy them green let them ripen

607
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,880
at home that's what I recommend

608
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,559
okay

609
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,740
that's a that's a really pretty one

610
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,740
right

611
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,980
and with this right here remember put it

612
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,299
like that and don't do it by hand never

613
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,620
do this

614
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:09,240
ow never do that right and you put it on

615
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,500
the board and you just give it a little

616
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,059
click and there you go comes off

617
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,620
and look listen

618
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,940
you don't even have to do this don't

619
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,700
even do it with a knife because I've

620
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,340
seen people do this I've seen people who

621
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,520
just don't have like a good handle on

622
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,900
doing this kind of thing so and they got

623
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,279
a really sharp knife and for the first

624
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,080
time they have a pick here and they end

625
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,260
up doing this and they miss and they hit

626
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,400
their hand right like wow like ah and

627
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,840
then you're on you're going to the

628
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,419
hospital right so you don't want to do

629
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,039
that too you want to be careful so I'll

630
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,419
do one more and you just dig it out with

631
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,760
a spoon we'll do this little one right

632
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:46,020
here here's a small avocado

633
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,600
right

634
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:50,940
so

635
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,340
there we go

636
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,020
and you can do a spoon if that's the way

637
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,179
to do it if you want you can also

638
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,140
squeeze it if the avocado is Right ripe

639
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,159
enough because I know a whole bunch of

640
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,440
people are like why don't you just

641
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,539
squeeze it aw you know you can do it

642
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,140
that way too but why don't like that is

643
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:09,240
sometimes if the avocado isn't that ripe

644
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,039
what happens is it ends up you squeeze

645
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,320
the pit out and you have a lot of the

646
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
avocado on the pit still so that's

647
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,679
another reason why I don't like doing it

648
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,419
and I don't when I'm busy and I'm

649
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,980
cruising and I'm trying to get you know

650
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,799
things done in time I don't want to be

651
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,600
trying to like bite it off or take you

652
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,120
know meat off the pit right it's just

653
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,860
it's a Time waster so that's why I do it

654
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,620
the other way so

655
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:36,020
let me scoop some avocado in here

656
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,020
okay now there is a

657
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,460
myth I call it a myth it's it's really

658
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,320
you know people put the pits back into

659
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,059
the bowl to try to keep the avocado

660
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,640
fresh it doesn't work

661
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,100
it's it's not that the only way you can

662
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,539
keep your avocado fresh is if the pit

663
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,580
wasn't removed out of that half right

664
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,460
so that's different you can't just make

665
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,260
a guacamole leaf and then put a pit on

666
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,760
top of the bowl and expect that to

667
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,860
actually keep it fresh that's just not

668
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,779
the way it works right so I'm putting it

669
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,059
in here you guys could see my halves are

670
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:12,059
going in here I'm not counting I'm just

671
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,460
making a bigger guacamole versus

672
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,679
um a really small one right

673
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,140
there we go

674
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,059
I don't like my avocados mushy I don't

675
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,779
like them over ripe they can get

676
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:27,419
fermented fermented causes trouble a

677
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,960
fermented avocado is not only disgusting

678
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,539
it tastes awful not only but it can give

679
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,820
you a belly ache so a fermented avocado

680
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:39,120
can definitely give you a belly ache so

681
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,820
keep that in mind right so this is a

682
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,340
very thin skin one right here

683
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,480
and you'll find some Skins are thicker

684
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:50,880
on the avocado some are thinner so

685
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,039
now some avocado varieties you can eat

686
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,740
the skin

687
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,880
some it's not a good idea

688
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,679
okay

689
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,480
so you guys if you just came on here

690
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,179

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,340
thing is like what people have to

731
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,659
understand right is that

732
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:51,779
this is a perfect chance to put medicine

733
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:54,840
in your food because

734
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:59,880
the fat hides

735
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:03,240
the flavor of really intense herb

736
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,980
amounts like when you're using Rosemary

737
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,559
in thyme so let's go over this a little

738
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,360
bit so I got some thyme right here

739
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:10,980
it's out of the garden I got some

740
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,720
Rosemary out of the garden too let's

741
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,760
cover this this is medicine right here

742
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,539
this herb it's incredible

743
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,880
now here's what I do now I cut these for

744
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:22,320
the show so I I took this off my

745
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,960
rosemary plant and I cut these for the

746
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,860
show right but I don't do that I don't

747
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,500
cut my rosemary plant ever I strip my

748
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,299
rosemary plant so here's how I do it is

749
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,480
say this rosemary plant is still here

750
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:38,940
and like and I'm outside right now and

751
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,240
I'm going up to my rosemary plant

752
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,820
for this show I said well I'm gonna cut

753
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
these so let me go and cut these for

754
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,140
everybody for this joke because I want

755
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,720
to show them this all right okay here we

756
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,760
go I cut these this is for the show now

757
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,340
I don't do that

758
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,799
this is what I do even though I had to

759
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,260
do for Joe this is what I do instead of

760
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,799
cutting them I take my hand

761
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,840
and I pull the leaves off but I leave

762
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,340
the stems so let's do that now so just

763
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,360
pretend this is just sitting out there

764
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,600
right

765
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,899
okay I'm outside now right

766
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,840
that's what I do did you see that

767
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:23,039
so when I'm making my food at home

768
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:25,559
I leave that stem like that on the plant

769
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,059
and then I have all the Rosemary in my

770
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,940
hand I'll show you a close-up real quick

771
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:33,899
now the reason why I do this is because

772
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,960
the leaves will grow back on this stem

773
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:39,360
faster than if you cut the whole stem

774
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,100
and now you're kind of just basically

775
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,539
cutting down and cutting back your

776
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,799
rosemary plant and then you're not going

777
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:45,059
to be able to use it all the time

778
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,500
because it's going to need to grow and

779
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,539
it could take a long time

780
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,159
so what I like doing is stripping the

781
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,899
plant down so it's something I want to

782
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,399
show you guys right there that I thought

783
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,320
was important

784
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,820
uh you know piece of important

785
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,399
information there

786
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,880
Marianne says aw please tell our friends

787
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:06,059
why they should wash them first avocados

788
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,500
why bother washing the avocado you can

789
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,480
get all the

790
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,980
germs you want

791
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,919
that's sitting there in the grocery

792
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,320
store and everybody's walking by and

793
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,299
they're all walking by and they're like

794
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,539
who cares they just came out of the

795
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:23,399
bathroom and he just wiped their butt

796
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,980
um do you know how they wipe their butt

797
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,320
do you know how people wipe their butt

798
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,480
are they good at it

799
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,419
right because

800
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,039
last I've known all these years people

801
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,600
who wipe their butt with the toilet

802
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,279
paper still get everything from their

803
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,260
butt all over their hands

804
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,620
they're not careful

805
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,779
so everybody just going to the store and

806
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,679
grabbing everything yeah and whatnot of

807
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,679
course that's just one thing

808
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,580
oh

809
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,179
oh

810
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,440
lots of sneezing going on my God but

811
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,940
that's okay

812
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,799
you know it doesn't matter if anybody

813
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,899
sneezes on your avocados in the store

814
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:06,480
either who cares right

815
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:09,179
don't wash them right it doesn't matter

816
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,519
oh the carriage oh there's only a

817
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,220
hundred varieties of streptococcus on a

818
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,899
carriage handle but that's okay is

819
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,700
everybody pushing their Carriage to the

820
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,860
store they can just touch the avocados

821
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,860
and kind of look for one I'm looking for

822
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,080
one right here oops I Spit on them uh oh

823
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,299
I was talking to someone and spit flung

824
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,159
out of my mouth on the avocados but

825
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:31,500
don't wash them because you don't need

826
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,240
to wash them just just take them home

827
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,220
from the store and just cut right in

828
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,840
there and make sure your kids and you

829
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,480
and everybody is just eating and

830
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,279
whatever no big deal that's why it's

831
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,840
important to wash them and that's just a

832
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,940
couple of reasons there's a lot more

833
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,179
reasons right

834
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,700
so what I'm doing here right so I'm just

835
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:53,700
kind of mashing these lightly at first I

836
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,840
don't want to puree these right

837
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,299
okay

838
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,120
and the other thing is the knife

839
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:02,340
will shove the germs in

840
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,039
so if you don't wash the outside in the

841
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,899
skin the knife is going to drive all the

842
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,580
germs in well that's right there's no

843
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:10,799
such thing as germs like people think

844
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,059
okay that's why everybody just went

845
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,100
through hell and back for the last

846
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,279
couple years and chronic illness is at

847
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,320
its worst anyway no there's no germs of

848
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,000
course not don't have to worry about no

849
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,039
bugs

850
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,559
suit it makes you stronger to get germs

851
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,840
oh it does oh sure

852
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:29,940
Susan Janet says I saw someone remove

853
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,059
their mask in the produce section so

854
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,080
they could pick their nose

855
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:40,500
really and I bet you that one person

856
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:45,360
that did that probably put the booger on

857
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,860
that produce at the same time so

858
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,600
all right

859
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,240

let's get into the herbs I gotta dice up

905
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:46,560
some herbs don't puree your guacamole

906
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,440
you will have Brown guacamole really

907
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,900
fast okay just letting you know lemon

908
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,839

00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:00,540
and but you still don't want to puree it

911
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,980

912
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,400
little bit

913
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,480
okay let's chop up some herbs let's do

914
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,079
that now

915
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,800
so I got some Rosemary right here

916
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,240
now this is a medicinal guacamole and

917
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,119
what you're looking at is a lot of

918
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,460
Rosemary it's the way I do it you don't

919
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,960
have to do it the way I do it you can do

920
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,020
it any way you want I'm going to strip

921
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,820
off more of this okay

922
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,380
see how much Rosemary's there look at

923
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,960
that I might even do a little bit more

924
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,700
check that out you guys that's the way I

925
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,540
do it

926
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,780
now this is very Rosemary e for real

927
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:43,320
okay like this is really serious like

928
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,480
amounts compared to that rosemary plant

929
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,280
that sits on the salmon at the

930
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,540
restaurant you know the rosemary plant

931
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,280
that sits on the salmon in the

932
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,740
restaurant little piece of rosemary

933
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,760
plant you just move it over this is like

934
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,760
a lot of Rosemary

935
00:36:55,859 --> 00:37:02,760
and I chop it really fine is what I do

936
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,680
okay that's how I like it

937
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
so I get it to a point where then I'll

938
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,760
chop it a little bit more too

939
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,560
just get it nice and good

940
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,680
there you go

941
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,079
so that's the Rosemary part I'm gonna

942
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,160
scoop it into my hand

943
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,160
and into the bowl

944
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,820
sprinkle it right on top

945
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,220
see how much went in there now you may

946
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,980
not like the taste of this so do less

947
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,540
how about just baby stepping I don't

948
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,280
have to do a lot of that let's get some

949
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,280
more herbs here whoa

950
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,460
what's this right so I took this out of

951
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,880
the garden

952
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,339
that's lemon balm okay now I like doing

953
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,339
a little bit of lemon balm in the

954
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:56,820
guacamole make it real medicinal the

955
00:37:53,339 --> 00:38:00,359
herbs make it medicinal avocado itself

956
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,280
on its own it's not medicinal enough to

957
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,260
take care of what we're up against right

958
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,760
now in the world of Health meaning the

959
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,099
problems people are up against the

960
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,320
pathogens the metals everything else

961
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:13,560
that's wrong with them it's not enough

962
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,680
to just eat an avocado as as beautiful

963
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,440
and pure and naturistic that avocado is

964
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,619
it's still got the fat in there and

965
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,480
that's okay it's a better fat but if

966
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:26,820
we're gonna eat that avocado and eat

967
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,300
that fat let's make it medicine because

968
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,820
we need things so we can fight sickness

969
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,960
and illness here's a little bit of lemon

970
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,000
balm

971
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,040
chopping up a little bit of lemon balm

972
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,800

973
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,660

1021
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,660
definitely all she's doing she's working

1022
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,660
hard at everything amazing

1023
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,420
so I just chopped up some garlic chives

1024
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,420
right there

1025
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:03,420

1026
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,520
stuff that's incredible she's using

1027
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,220

1033
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,640
some oregano so I got some oregano here

1034
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,280
Oregano's got a strong flavor but when

1035
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:30,240
you're using avocado

1036
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:33,060
to mask the flavor intense flavors of

1037
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,119
these herbs you're using it

1038
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:38,640
right as a vehicle like Michelle said

1039
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,760
that's what you're doing so I'm doing

1040
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,980
some now oregano now this guacamole is

1041
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,380
getting really medicinal

1042
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,200
that might have been a a weed right

1043
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,800
there from the garden

1044
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,800

1045
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,560
all right there we go got some oregano

1046
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,560
now so let's chop up that

1047
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,920

1048
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,940

1049
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,940

1050
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,640
we're also going to put some scallions

1051
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,220
in

1052
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,380
so we're gonna have that too

1053
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,020
now you can chop them up as fine as you

1054
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,920
want I like it just fine enough

1055
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,920

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,839

1095
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,380

1096
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,240

1097
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,800
you guys know I love it putting that in

1098
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,200
the guacamole let's keep on going

1099
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,540
scallions

1100
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,400
right oh we got some right here look at

1101
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,480
this I always Cut Off The Roots I want

1102
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,660
to show you guys

1103
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:20,160
here's what I do Cut Off The Roots

1104
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,380
I didn't have to cut that I could have

1105
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,900
cut back even better than that but I was

1106
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,480
doing that pretty quick right so

1107
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,339
I like scallions inside

1108
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,319
my guacamole

1109
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:34,319
flavors it nicely

1110
00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:36,000
hides well as well as you know like if

1111
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,819
you're somebody that's really you don't

1112
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,339
like that onion flavor

1113
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:44,280
gives it texture too so that's what's

1114
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:46,859
incredible about the scallions gives the

1115
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,200
guacamole texture

1116
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:52,500
something in there right

1117
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,300
I like my guacamole nice and

1118
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,880
like I want things in there right

1119
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,640
incredible any particular Sage you can

1120
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,200
use the one that you like best for sure

1121
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,940
so let's move on we've got some

1122
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,880
scallions in there okay here's one

1123
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:09,119
that's interesting

1124
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:11,060
mustard greens you guys mustard greens

1125
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,880
now

1126
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:16,319
the World of Food Science

1127
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,900
right

1128
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,000
believes it's just a green

1129
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,819
mustard greens

1130
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,460
but mustard greens should be classified

1131
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:28,800
as an herb

1132
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:31,200
it's a mistake it's not classified

1133
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,319
correctly out there people don't know

1134
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,760
that that is an herb and it should be

1135
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:41,040
classified as such very medicinal very

1136
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,980
spicy very strong but really really

1137
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,119
medicinal I put mustard greens that came

1138
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,339
out of the garden because I'm growing

1139
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,859
some mustard greens right now

1140
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:51,660
now mustard greens are really too sharp

1141
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,760
for a lot of people they can't eat them

1142
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,040
because they're too sharp they're like

1143
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,160
oh my God that was like horseradish in

1144
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:01,619
the worst way it was so sharp okay now I

1145
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,720
don't cut this up that fine mustard

1146
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,119
greens I like because it's a soft green

1147
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,339
I like it to go in just like that but

1148
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,599
what you guys have to know

1149
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:12,480
is that

1150
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,839
that's an herb you're putting in very

1151
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,980
sharp but the fat hides it

1152
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,900
so you'll see here look how herb that is

1153
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,180
like that's herbed out

1154
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:28,140
there's no weed in there

1155
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,180
no weed man so it is just straight

1156
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,859
herb right good herb so let's keep on

1157
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,319
moving

1158
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:36,480
let's go with I think we got to do our

1159
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,200
peppers in there some hot peppers

1160
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,859
let's get a Cayenne

1161
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,660
in that guacamole right now listen you

1162
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:48,240
can make it the way you want to make it

1163
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:49,319
you can just get some ideas here what

1164
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,000
about that

1165
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:54,420
you guys check out the medical meme

1166
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,640
podcast at Apple podcast avocado are you

1167
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,400
avocado toast

1168
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,560
check out the episode I talk all about

1169
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,780
the avocado stuff that's really

1170
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:06,000
important to know

1171
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,160
it's a great episode really proud of it

1172
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,440
now that's a cayenne pepper here's a

1173
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,700
jalapeno right there that can go in

1174
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,880
there too

1175
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,819
it's a red jalapeno happens to be much

1176
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,980
hotter than a green when you let them go

1177
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:22,140
red like that that's out of the garden I

1178
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,359
like to grow peppers um you know I

1179
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,520
definitely love growing peppers right

1180
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:28,020
that's a sweet pepper right there and

1181
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,339
it's not a bell pepper like this but

1182
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,780
it's a sweet pepper I'll show you guys

1183
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:33,420
if you want to see

1184
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,359
and so this is

1185
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,579
um these are obviously sweeter milder

1186
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:40,920
this got a little bit of spice to it

1187
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:42,240
right so you can cut the back off like

1188
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,000
that

1189
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,380
take the stem out

1190
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,380
okay and then

1191
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,440
so I like to cut this

1192
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,680
pretty small

1193
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,960
I even like the Rind up inside of it

1194
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,099
right the pith

1195
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,099
the pulp inside of it

1196
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,040
I don't want to mince this until it's

1197
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,800
too small

1198
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,540
I like something to bite onto with this

1199
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,540
guacamole this medicinal guacamole

1200
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,119
and I'm gonna get that pepper in

1201
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,920
all right

1202
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,240
incredible

1203
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,160
all right so let's think about other

1204
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,740
stuff we need to put into that we have

1205
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,500
here so I think we cover the herbs which

1206
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,940
is really awesome so we got that now

1207
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,720
let's get some

1208
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,720
lemon

1209
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,099
in here actually I'm gonna cut an onion

1210
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,720
so looking like I don't know what I'm

1211
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:42,660
doing for a second but I'm looking for

1212
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,819
an onion right one here so with this

1213
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,280
onion this is a red onion they're

1214
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:49,760
usually bitier they're usually hotter

1215
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,760
right

1216
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,099
it's not a sweet onion sometimes there's

1217
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,440
some yellow onions that are just brutal

1218
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,200
right you guys I like to peel back the

1219
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,059
spit the skin and I'll tell you why too

1220
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,040
it's not that you can't eat those it's

1221
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,800
just that they're so chewy They Don't

1222
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,740
Really break down right like the skin

1223
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,660
I know people like to punish me a lot of

1224
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:15,000
people love that they love the punish aw

1225
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:18,000
and be like the Skins were the best

1226
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,079
stuff is hey W takes the skin off he

1227
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,020
doesn't know what he's talking about

1228
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,780
that proves it it's not gonna follow him

1229
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,359
anymore he didn't know about this one

1230
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,040
this one person says you gotta have the

1231
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,780
skin

1232
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,420
right

1233
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:36,480
but I like taking the skin off because

1234
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,619
the skin on the onions could be hiding

1235
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,200
something

1236
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,819
from the market like people like when

1237
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,040
they're grabbing their onions and

1238
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,720
they're you know or you know stocking

1239
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,700
them and they got like bacteria and

1240
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,000
other things on their hands and the the

1241
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:54,300
pathogens could get up under the skin so

1242
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,579
I like to kind of take a layer off right

1243
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,260
now I'm going to put a little bit of

1244
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:00,960
this red onion in there that's that's

1245
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:04,880
what I like to do okay

1246
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,880
like to put a little bit of red onion in

1247
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,220
don't want it too thick don't want it

1248
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:11,280
too thin

1249
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:14,280
I'm gonna chop that up

1250
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:17,300
flip it around for a second okay

1251
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,300
that's going in

1252
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,079
listen if you don't like onion if it's

1253
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,359
too sharp for you you don't have to put

1254
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,660
it in your guacamole you can put just

1255
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:30,540
Rosemary and Sage you guys but I'm

1256
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:32,460
making a really really medicinal one so

1257
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:34,800
let's get the Lemon Let's get the lime

1258
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,960
going right so we got some lemons right

1259

1260
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,200
foreign

1261
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,880
which is incredible is

1262
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:53,460
you can put lime in your guacamole now I

1263
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,200
don't put a lot of lemon in my guacamole

1264
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,559
I'm only putting a little bit of lemon

1265
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,700
by the way lemon is medicine too it's

1266
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,440
medicinal

1267
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,020
for sure okay

1268
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,200
I'm not putting a lot of lemon in I

1269
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:10,200
don't want my guacamole watery

1270
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,240
don't want it too too wet and watery

1271
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,160
that's number one right

1272
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,160
okay now check this out though

1273
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,500
right

1274
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:26,280
okay lime brings out avocado flavor like

1275
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:29,760
nothing else does it has a reaction

1276
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,800
with the sugar in avocado so lime has a

1277
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,260
reaction with the sugar and the fat and

1278
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:38,220
avocado so I love lime I like putting a

1279
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:40,380
lot of lime in my guacamole

1280
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,740
it's one of one of my favorite things to

1281
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,000
do the flavor does it compare I feel

1282
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,740
personally

1283
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,839
you guys just came on here we're talking

1284
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,240
about the avocado episode you can

1285
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:54,359
obviously see I'm just a little pumped

1286
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,059
up about that episode released it last

1287
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:59,400
night I hope you guys heard it link is

1288
00:51:57,059 --> 00:52:01,380
in the description right

1289
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,700
I'm gonna do one more lime so I'm gonna

1290
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,740
go with two limes with this with

1291
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,540
everything I got in here

1292
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,180
someone yelled at me the other day and

1293
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:11,760
said stop throwing fruit around

1294
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,619
stop tossing fruit in the air

1295
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,420
but I've been doing it you know my whole

1296
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:17,040
life a lot of times the fruit might end

1297
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,380
up on the floor something might hit

1298
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,420
something I was over a friend's house a

1299
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,559
couple years ago and I threw a piece of

1300
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,040
fruit in the air

1301
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,420
and it knocked over his wine glass which

1302
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,819
I thought was funny because I wasn't

1303
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:32,400
drinking wine

1304
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:34,500
and the wine glass knocked over and the

1305
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,200
wine went on his carpet

1306
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:40,140
and it was a white carpet

1307
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,540
so let's talk about salt that's the next

1308
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,740
thing right now if you guys got a second

1309
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,319
okay

1310
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,000
I feel like that's perfect amount of

1311
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,980
lime for the moment

1312
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,740
now

1313
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,859
everybody loves salt in their guacamole

1314
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,119
right or pepper salt and pepper they

1315
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:59,520
love salt

1316
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,020
here's why I don't use salt in my

1317
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,300
guacamole first of all I'm not a big

1318
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:04,619
salt fan because you don't want too much

1319
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,319
salt

1320
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:09,540
in your diet because it ends up building

1321
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:11,640
up it ends up building up in your liver

1322
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,200
it can build up in your brain I talk

1323
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,520
about that in the brain books you got to

1324
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,339
check it out when you get get a chance

1325
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:20,160
and check these brain books out

1326
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:22,680
but the reason why I don't like salt in

1327
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,020
guacamole is it sweats it

1328
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:27,780
I don't want everything sweating because

1329
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,780
what salt does in here is it sweats the

1330
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:34,500
onion it sweats the pepper it sweats the

1331
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:37,500
avocado so it starts to disfigure it it

1332
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,359
starts to pull moisture out of it in the

1333
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,460
wrong way you don't want to do that and

1334
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,280
then it turns into kind of like a sweaty

1335
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:47,760
slob so I don't like putting salt in the

1336
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:50,280
guacamole I like to use lime as that

1337
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,599
salt and then I like to use a celery

1338
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,640
stick

1339
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,760
as

1340
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,500
a tool because it's a salty tool but the

1341
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,240
right kind of salt right the good stuff

1342
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,579
so

1343
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,220
you guys know like I've written books

1344
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:07,559
books about the the sodium that sits

1345
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,599
inside celery right

1346
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,400
sodium cluster salt it's a different

1347
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,200
flavor it's a whole different kind of

1348
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,460
composition

1349
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,460
so

1350
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,980
I don't like to I like it kind of a

1351
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,200
hunkier guacamole for me you guys might

1352
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,540
like it as a creamy puree

1353
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,819
not a big fan of it that way but I don't

1354
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:29,099
want pole halves in here so I'm just

1355
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:31,500
kind of mashing up

1356
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:33,780
the whole halves right kind of breaking

1357
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,880
them up a little bit there we go

1358
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,040
so that when you stick a cracker in

1359
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,780
there if you have guests or something or

1360
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,400
you stick something in there a chip

1361
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,500
because you know someone might like some

1362
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,940
chips that you're not getting like stuck

1363
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,940
on a whole half of avocado

1364
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:51,740
right now mixing this up

1365
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,220
there we go

1366
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,079
now you can put tomato on top you can

1367
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,640
put tomato on the side you can do

1368
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:05,760
anything like that

1369
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,319
let me chop up a couple of tools one

1370
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,240
tool I like to use which I'll show you

1371
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:11,099
right here to actually scoop my

1372
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,380
guacamole I'll show you in a minute so

1373
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:16,579
let me start making

1374
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,579
um a couple tools here

1375
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:23,099
so here's one tool I use which people

1376
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,380
think I'm crazy

1377
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:27,359
but I put guacamole right on a whole

1378
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,579
half of onion like that now I know that

1379
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,740
like probably doesn't seem right and

1380
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:35,040
someone's got probably something to say

1381
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:36,480
about that I'm sure like but yeah like

1382
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,819
you know meaning like because it looks

1383
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,619
kind of like so intense sometimes we're

1384
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:42,960
like oh my God how does he do that like

1385
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:45,059
so I take like pieces of onion that are

1386
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,220
big pieces like this and I like to use

1387
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:50,819
that let me chop up some bell pepper

1388
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:53,780
that's a great tool to pick guacamole on

1389
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:53,780
right there

1390
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:59,339
so

1391
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,280
what you can do is you can make some

1392
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:04,200
some bell pepper slices right here

1393
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,760
so I'm just going to prepare these make

1394
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,420
a little crudite you can have it with

1395
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,420
your guacamole

1396
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,079
right got some bell pepper

1397
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,079
that's amazing that'll go in

1398
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,260
and celery sticks is another great thing

1399
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,260
all on its own

1400
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:27,660
guys if you just got here we're making a

1401
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:32,660
medicinal guacamole we actually already

1402
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:35,900
made it okay so I got a cucumber

1403
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,900
right here

1404
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,339
now you can peel the Cucumber if you

1405
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,260
want I wash this cucumber really good

1406
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:47,059
but the thing about cucumbers though

1407
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:50,760
organic produce does have they still use

1408
00:56:47,059 --> 00:56:52,819
a coating on the outside of a lot of

1409
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,819
um

1410
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,900
a lot of them so let me just see if I

1411
00:56:56,339 --> 00:56:59,819
can just kind of take down the skin a

1412
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,940
little bit

1413
00:56:59,819 --> 00:57:07,040
real quick for you guys there we go

1414
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,040
not going to take it completely off but

1415
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:12,200
take some of it off

1416
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,059
there you go amazing

1417
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:24,200
I don't like using the skin of a

1418
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:24,200
cucumber personally

1419
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:30,540
unless it came out of the garden big

1420
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,099
difference right there unless it came

1421
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,319
out of the garden and that's another

1422
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:37,079
story right there okay so I'm gonna do

1423
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,940
is do some cucumber slices I like to do

1424
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,180
that as an option

1425
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,180
foreign

1426
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:48,599
sticks that's another way to do it right

1427
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:52,700
so I'll do two kinds

1428
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,700
get this ready for you guys

1429
00:57:54,299 --> 00:57:59,420
and then I'm gonna actually cut the

1430
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,420
sticks right here like that

1431
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,760
okay

1432
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,720
and get some of them like that

1433
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:16,680
it's an option

1434
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,260
all right got some onion pieces here

1435
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:23,240

1436
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,240

1499
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,520
lot of people to do because onion is too

1500
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,920
strong for them but I love it that's one

1501
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,079
way I do it right there I'll do that as

1502
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,540
an option

1503
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,359

get a celery stick and dip it in there

1506
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,940

1507
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,520

they told us that avocado was poisonous

1545
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:40,260
and they're right by calling the right

1546
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:43,440
yes I was in my mansion

1547
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:46,619
I was in my Mansion oh yeah when we were

1548
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,260
skiing in the Alps yes and they brought

1549
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:52,619
us avocado and I smacked it out of the

1550
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:56,400
waitress's hand I stepped on the avocado

1551
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:58,260
on the floor and I told the manager at

1552
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:00,180
that place since I donated a lot of

1553
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,940
money in the area to fire that waitress

1554
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:05,160
and they fired her

1555
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,020
how dare you give me an avocado we were

1556
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,260
told medical school that avocados are

1557
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:12,660
toxic and poisonous yeah yeah

1558
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,520

01:04:31,559 --> 01:04:35,880
if you read the medical medium books

1567
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,579

the greatest transition tools

1615

1616
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:30,480
the avocado I have a connection to the

1617
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:32,220
avocado for saving people's lives I've

1618
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,079
been able to get people

1619
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,599
off of eggs

1620
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,240

1622
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:45,720
of eggs I use the avocado to get them

1623
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:47,579
off of something bad that was holding
