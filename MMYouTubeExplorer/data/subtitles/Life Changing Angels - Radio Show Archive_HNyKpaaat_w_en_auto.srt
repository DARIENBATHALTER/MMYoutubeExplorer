decades ahead of what's out there now as

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,360
I've always said before who has 10 or 20

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,680
or 30 years to wait for answers to their

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,680
illnesses life is precious and there's

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,239
no time to spare and that's true you

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,039
know that really is we know that life is

16
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:53,520
precious you know that you totally know

17
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,199
that I know that other people know that

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,359
I'm sure maybe not everybody on the

19
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,719
planet knows that now we we do we do we

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,120
do have that guess that there are some

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,080
some people on the planet that don't

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
really think life is precious and and

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,439
you know that's that's true but for the

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,720
majority we do know how precious life is

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,799
and that really matters and who has the

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,799
5 or 10 years to get an answer and you

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,360
know someone came to me just

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,360
recently and you know they were they

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,159
were sick for about 2 years 2 years they

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,960
were sick and what it was was they had

31
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,320
this stomach and digestive tract problem

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,200
candida another said it had to be Lyme

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,720
disease others which didn't make any

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
sense to me to have you know digestive

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
trouble and it be Lyme disease anyway so

56
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,680
I was being kind of like pointy about it

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,160
by saying oh two years that's all I

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,840
didn't mean to do that you're right two

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,959
years is a long time okay and it is a

60
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,800
long time to not have answers to not

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,720
know what you need to do and she goes it

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,319
took two years to know that all I had to

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,159
do was drink celery juice and raise my

64
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,319
hydrochloric acid with celery juice even

65
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,239
though I knew about hydrochloric acid

66
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,159
but there was no way to fix it and then

67
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,640

vegetarian and then I did this but I

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,439
didn't know that all I had to do was

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,439
start getting 16 ounces of celery juice

90
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:48,120
once a day in fact she did 16 ounces of

91
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:50,280
celery juice twice a day twice a day and

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,159
her problem started going away she

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,400
couldn't believe it she said two years

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,040
of her life and and and okay and I said

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,519
to her I said to her I said two years

96
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,439
that's all and yeah that got her upset

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,360
that that got her upset and it dawned on

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,840
me absolutely rightfully so rightfully

99
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,640

100
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,959
the moment or real you know a real dummy

101
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,799
because yeah the reason why I was saying

102
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,519
it to begin with is cuz I know people

103
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,759

104
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,519

130
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,639
two years damn right it shouldn't have

131
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,520
to take two years and it it should you

132
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
know to find an answer and and she's

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
right but you know but but at the same

134
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,800
time of course I know I know people that

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,600
came to me after 20 years 30 years of it

136
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,560
and or or search and came to find

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,840
information that we offer all the time

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,400
and they've been through 20 years of no

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,080
answers with fatigue and just you know

140
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,639
all kinds of random symptoms and

141
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,280
neurological symptoms that they don't

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
even know it's neurological cuz no one

143
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,120
even tells them it's neurological

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,680
because no one even knows and that's a

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440
whole another problem as it is nobody

146
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,960
knows what symptoms are you go to a a

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
dozens of practitioners and they can't

148
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,680
even figure out what the symptom is oh

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,960
we don't know what that tingles is I we

150
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,160
don't know what that numbness is oh we

151
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,759
don't know what ringing in the ears

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,680
really what causes it you know we don't

153
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,560
know what the vertigo maybe it's the

154
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,120
stones in the uh in the inner ear

155
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,440
causing the vertigo no vertigo is

156
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,560
neurological it's neurological so the

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,560
point is that and depression is

158
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,160
neurological and it goes on and on and

159
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:22,360
on but the point is she waited 2 years

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,919
it was a world of time time in her life

161
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,240
you know I I you know I wasn't taking it

162
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,599
seriously enough and I said well hey

163
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,039
that's all you waited and because of the

164
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,039
fact so many people waited so much

165
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,000
longer but I but I have to respect and

166
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,479
realize yeah 2 years is a lot and she's

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,160
totally right and so she found some

168
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,759

the way is is it's it's pure information

183
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
what I mean by that it hasn't gone

184
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,080
through already the internet in a

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,960
million different ways and then all

186
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,400
these different people trying to get a

187
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,639
name in in in the business or the field

188
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,800
out there they you're taking it and and

189
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,800
altering it and moving it and then it

190
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,240
gets lost and then who do you go to and

191
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,319
then this whole bit and what I mean by

192
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,960
that is I mean that everybody like you

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720

greatest way the greatest way possible

226
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,399
are these life-changing Angels nobody

227
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,440
knows about the life-changing Angels

228
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,720
when I found out from Spirit when I

229
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,600
found out from Spirit a long time ago I

230
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,800
was just I I was just I was overtaken by

231
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,959
it I couldn't even imagine I was like

232
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,880
what did you say and spirit was like

233
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,200
well I'm telling you about these

234
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,480
life-changing Angels you need to know

235
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,120

236
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,959

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,920
there and I was blown off my seat I was

238
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,519
just blown away and it moved me greatly

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,240
because I didn't know that there are

240
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,480
these angels that did what they do like

241
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,000
the life-changing Angels do around food

259
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
chapter of life-changing angels and in

260
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,120
life-changing Foods book you know I said

261
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,360
you know what this has to be here and

262
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,360
spirit said spirit said yes it has to be

263
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,200
in here and it's something that you just

264
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,320
don't expect to be in a food book that

265
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,880
talks about you know protecting your

266
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,079
family giving your family everything you

267
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,279
know it your family needs to survive and

268
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,680
thrive in this world longevity in the

269
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,240
way it's supposed to be the right kinds

270
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,959
of foods that stop disease and illness

271
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,320
the foods that help us emotionally the

272
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
foods that help us spiritually with

273
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,639
spiritual lessons you name it and you

274
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,360
didn't you wouldn't think that there'd

275
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:10,079
be an angel chapter in this book but it

276
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,440
was the perfect place I didn't want it

277
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,480
in the first book because this is these

278
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,760
are the angels that govern the food on

279
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,800
the planet and this is a whole different

280
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:25,360
pack of angels one that's really

281
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,160
forgotten not just forgotten unknown and

282
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,120
needs to be known in its time and spirit

283
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,399
wants everybody to know who's supporting

284
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,360
them who's supporting you in your life

285
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,920
how these angels are there supporting

286
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,760
you in your life and the power of that

287
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,240
what could really happen with that so

288
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,680
this is really exciting if this is the

289
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,600
first time you've ever heard my show and

290
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,760
this is the first show it goes back to

291
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
me it it it goes back in my life at age

292
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,800
four four years old and spirit spoke to

293
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,320
me from the outside of my ear and told

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
me that my grandmother had lung cancer

295
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,240
and told me to actually pronounce

296
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,839
announce and say that grandmother has

297
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,320
lung cancer so that all started for me

298
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,959
at age four when I had to announce that

299
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,480
at the dinner table I had to get off my

300
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,680
chair walk up to my grandmother and

301
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,920
spirit said say grandma grandma has lung

302
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,360
cancer I had to pronounce that and then

303
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,279
spent the rest of my life helping people

304
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,320
and giving them information about what's

305
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,199
going on with their health and

306
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,279
well-being and what they need to move

307
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,959
forward and heal so I've dedicated my

308
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,000
life doing this and um and helped tens

309
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,160
of thousands of people along the way and

310
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,800
we're still helping people and

311
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,639
technology has brought even more ability

312
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
to help more people and um and I'm I'm

313
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,240
thankful for it all and so I'm here now

314
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,120
this is what I do this is what I'm doing

315
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,880
is making sure you get the information

316
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,680
that you need to protect your family to

317
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,360
take care of yourself to make sure you

318
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,920
don't get sick to make sure you can get

319
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,680
healthy to make sure you can move

320
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,480
forward that's what matters that's what

321
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,040
matters to me right there you know right

322
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,639
there you know you can live in a Palace

323
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:09,360
you can just live in a palace a massive

324
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:13,839
massive Empire Palace and if you're

325
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,480
sick it just really it doesn't help and

326
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,320
it doesn't matter meaning that when

327
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,760
you're sick no matter what circumstances

328
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,360
or where you are in your life whether

329
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:28,320
you're in a palace okay or you're on a

330
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,040
ship somewhere or you're or you're you

331
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,680
know where ever it is or you're just you

332
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,880
know living it up in a spaceship going

333
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,240
to the moon when we become sick it it

334
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,199
takes us out of our situation that we're

335
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
in whatever that is meaning whatever is

336
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,040
going on in our life you know what I

337
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
mean by that is there is someone that

338
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,680
there was an athlete that uh contacted

339
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,000
me pretty recently one one that's well

340
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,199
known and the athlete the athlete was

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,800
like look everything was going great I'm

342
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,720
doing great all this is um you know I've

343
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,920
always been healthy I've always exceeded

344
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I'm well known for it here's my records

345
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,880
this is what I've done and now I'm sick

346
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,560
and I can't see it anymore I can't see

347
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,839
it it's it's not there in my vision

348
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,160
anymore and I said you know what that's

349
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,160
that's what happens and that's what I

350
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,440
meant that's what I meant by you can be

351
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,880
in a palace you can be on a ship you can

352
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,079
be uh in a spaceship going to the moon

353
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,360
and that's your thing whatever ever your

354
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,839
thing is you could be an athlete you

355
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,480
could be here and there at your best you

356
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,440
could be whatever it is that you do in

357
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,440
life you can be an executive you can be

358
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,920
you know someone who works you can be an

359
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,920
intern somewhere but when you get sick

360

364
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,639

396
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,560

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,880
be getting worse and I can back out I I

398
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,639

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,199
marriage that started brand new marriage

404
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,880
that was able to happen and that that's

405
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,319
what I mean in this world we lose hope

406
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,440
we lose sight others around us lose hope

407
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,399
and sight and you know that's the

408
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,319
difficulty

409
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,360
involved and like I was telling you

410
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:50,399
about this athlete this athlete was like

411
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,319
it was just I was fine I was at the top

412
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,319
of my game I was at the best of my game

413
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:58,639
I started getting sick no real answers

414
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,120
can't get better all I see is I don't

415
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,319
even see the game anymore can't play the

416
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,720
game can't see it I'm lost in a fog so

417
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,480
it doesn't matter where you are like I

418
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,319
said you could be all happy and on you

419
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,839
know on a trip to the moon in a

420
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,000
spaceship and you get sick and you

421
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,240
you're not even going to Care not even

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,919
going to care about when you're about to

423
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
land on the moon because you know what

424
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,720
you're sick and this is what happens and

425
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,160
we get blinded by our illness and our

426
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,400
sickness and our struggles we get

427
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:31,080
blinded by it it's like an instant

428
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,720
blindness so why am I talking about this

429
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,880
why am I talking about this because the

430
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,760
angels can help us with that that

431
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,760
blindness so when you lose your sight

432
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,720
and you're struggling no matter where it

433
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,919
is what direction of struggling the

434
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,640
angels can help with that sight even

435
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,919
though we can't see the angels I know

436
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,480
we're in a world and you guys know this

437
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,679
I know we're in a world where if you

438
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,520
can't see it it ain't real so if you

439
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,440
can't see it it's not real if you can't

440
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,440
see it it's not real it isn't

441
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:13,039
real you know that's what we think

442
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,039
that's what we think um you we have to

443
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,600
see it to believe it I told you that

444
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,960
before you know that but you already

445
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,159
knew that anyway it's a it's you know

446
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,679
you have to see it to believe it kind of

447
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:27,559
world that's what it is and I understand

448
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,039
that I understand that it happens to me

449
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,200
until people come to the events you know

450
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,480
because people who don't know me and

451
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
they say oh yeah yeah he hears a voice

452
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,280
people who don't know me or anything and

453
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,159
know what I've done they're just like

454
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,120
okay he hears a voice okay I'd like to

455
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,360
see it to believe it and then they go to

456
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,360
the event and they walk out of there in

457
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,080
shock and and yeah but it's like it's a

458
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,039
see it to believe it kind of world we're

459
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,000
in and what happens is is when we're

460
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,679
sick you know when we're sick and we're

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,799
getting sick it's hard to see it from

462
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,280
the outside it's like you're not sick

463
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,240
you look fine you can't be that sick you

464
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,039
look okay unless you just have a stroke

465
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,360
and you're just flat on your face and

466
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,440
you're break your jaw when you when you

467
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,000
fall on the

468
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,559
cement and that's another story then

469
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,120
somebody would be like oh yeah yeah no

470
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,679
there's there's there's a man down here

471
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,640
there's a man down but when we're sick

472
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,559
we're walking around with all this

473
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,280
different chronic illness like like

474
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,559
example of the person the woman I was

475
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,600
telling you about the young woman I was

476
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:30,200
telling you about that had the digestive

477
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,919
trouble and the the trouble in the gut

478
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,480
and the bloating and the stomach ache

479
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,720
and the all that going on everybody else

480
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
around her was just saying you know I I

481
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,120
don't think you really got this going on

482
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,880
the doctor can't kind of figure it out

483
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,559
they're all throwing different things at

484
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:51,440
you and so maybe it's in your head and

485
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,120
that's what her her um um boyfriend was

486
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,840
saying before they were married that's

487
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,159
what that's what her partner was saying

488
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,640
he was saying well yeah I don't know if

489
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,640
it's really actually happening with her

490
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,799
I can't tell she says it's bothering her

491
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,679
but she looks fine she's acting fine

492
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,679
it's cuz she was struggling to persevere

493
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,360
through she was struggling to push

494
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:16,600
through so you know but here's the deal

495
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,799
with the angels we don't see him so easy

496
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,159
okay I know people who have seen

497
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,280
him I I definitely know people who have

498
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,400
seen him right and I've seen them too

499
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
I've been blessed to see see him I mean

500
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,919
I don't know if you've read the the uh

501
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,840
my first book when if you've read that

502
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,520
with the first chapter where I was

503
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,880
saving my dog's life and I was in the

504
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,679
freezing cold Frid cold water and um

505
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,600
Spirit told me to dive down and I dove

506
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,360
down and open opened my eyes and there

507
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,640
was an angel in the water holding on to

508
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,360
my dog 8 ft

509
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,840
down and you know that that you know i'

510
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,919
start getting a little choked up and a

511
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,799
little emotional even telling that story

512
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:07,400
and so I saw what I

513
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,600
saw it lit up underneath that water it

514
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,000
lit up it was a flash of light

515
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,919
underneath that water and I saw an angel

516
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,720
8 ft down in that water and I swear to

517
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,279
God I could breathe under that water I

518
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,600
wasn't even holding my breath anymore

519
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,640
and I was breathing under that water

520
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,080
that's what I felt like and maybe I

521
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,960
wasn't breathing under that water

522
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,880
obviously and maybe I was still holding

523
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,760
my breath but I felt

524
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,360
free I felt free for that very moment as

525
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,480
that angel lit up under the water

526
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,880
holding on my dog holding on to my dog

527
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,880
deep in that

528
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,760
water and and I I just felt like I had

529
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:53,440
all the air in the world inside of my

530
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,320
lungs and and so you know it it it's

531
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,480
it's sure we have to see it to believe

532
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,480
it but here's the thing if you haven't

533
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,640
seen an Angel yet in your

534
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:06,159
lifetime you might have not even known

535
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,720
it think back go through all the

536
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,600
different steps of your life all the way

537
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,679
till

538
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:17,120
childhood do you remember ever seeing an

539
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,720
angel you remember possibly seeing an

540
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,559
angel at at all and any any possibility

541
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,279
is it there it could be you might have

542
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,039
seen an angel absolutely you might have

543
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:32,919
seen two you might might have heard an

544
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,240
angel you know in this world we're told

545
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:39,080
to just not go there we're told to not

546
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,000
go there it's not a place where we're

547
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,640
you know where we're allowed to play in

548
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,640
it's not a place where we're allowed to

549
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,360
you know it's imaginary in this world

550
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:50,720
it's like it's called

551
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,960
imaginary and what that does is it shuts

552
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,039
out it shuts out our ability to have

553
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,039
that faith and have that

554
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,840
Vision so you know in your life you

555
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,559
should you kind of surf through your

556
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:08,480
life a little bit and see where you may

557
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,880
remember an angel in some way some shape

558
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,400
or form it could have even been this one

559
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,240
person that helped you at one time that

560
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,960
had that Angelic

561
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,760
nature and that matters too greatly that

562
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,640
matters greatly that Angelic nature that

563
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,640
can be in someone to help to help you in

564
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,159
a hard time you know people tell me they

565
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,240
say you know this person helped me in a

566
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,080
hard time I swear to God they're they're

567
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,919
my

568
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:43,320
angel they're my angel and you know and

569
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:47,279
this does happen in our lives some of us

570
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,200
are fortunate to have that help and so

571
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,679
think back a little bit and search and

572
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,480
if you can't think about it now and you

573
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,520
can't remember now it's going to come CU

574
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,039
we bury it we bury it when we're young

575
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,240
and we bury it when we get older too so

576
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
when we have an experience that an angel

577
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,360
was involved with that could have helped

578
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,919
us in any way or showed us a way or

579
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,240
showed us a direction in some way you

580
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:18,120
name it if that happened we could have

581
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,600
buried it because we can't really talk

582
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,679
about it and who are you going to talk

583
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,279
to about it and some of us don't have a

584
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,799
lot of options of people to talk to it

585
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:30,200
about and that kind of thing that we can

586
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,360
express our feelings about

587
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,080
angels and you know when you think about

588
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,760
Ang oh yes yeah an angel sure sure you

589
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,720
know

590
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,120
butterflies

591
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,240
fairies you know the whole bit

592
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,240
leprechauns you know um you know the

593
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,440
thing is is this it's it's angels are

594
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,520
real I'm going to give you a little

595
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,880
background of some angels right

596
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,320
now right now happening there's a battle

597
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,360
going on there's something called the

598
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,279
quickening occurring right now that

599
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,000
means things are happening faster than

600
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,080
ever before in

601
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,679
history the days of kind of moseying on

602
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,399
into your house okay and grabbing a

603
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
newspaper and sitting on a rocking chair

604
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,000
in front of the

605
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,279
fireplace those days are not really upon

606
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
us anymore as they used to

607
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,520
be and I'm sure listen that doesn't mean

608
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,760
you can't sit on your favorite rocking

609
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,360
chair and read a paper it just means

610
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,760
the day of that is

611
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,200
changing the day of that is changing you

612
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,760
know the world is changing things are

613
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,039
happening really really fast right now

614
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,080
and you know it you see it I mean come

615
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,840
on and that that speed of which

616
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,440
everything's happening right now Spirit

617
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,279
calls us the

618
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,399
quickening and that quickening also

619
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,799
means that angels are working harder

620
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:00,600
than ever before in history and and

621
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:02,320
human history and Angelic history to

622
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,440
protect us in any way

623
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,240
possible angels are dying out fires left

624
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,640
and right on the planet dying out fires

625
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,360
left and light right all over the planet

626
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,480
because there is a battle because

627
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,480
there's this negative energy that

628
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,240
encompasses like the

629
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,520
greed and the Darkness on the planet and

630
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,480
the evil okay now if you say what is he

631
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,960
talking about greed darkness and Evil on

632
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,120
the planet what kind of what kind of

633
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,960
thing would you say that for well I'm

634
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,559
talking about you know all the adversity

635
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,559
that's created by the Wars created by

636
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,559
all of the anger created by all that's

637
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,640
happening all that adversity all that

638
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:51,360
non peace all that unrest that's fed

639
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,799
that's fed by this negativity that the

640
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,240
angels have to battle all the time so

641
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:58,120
there's a war and the angels are trying

642
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,679
to do everything they can

643
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,360
to stop anything and everything that

644
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,720
shouldn't be happening on the planet so

645
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,640
they're really busy with this this

646
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,120
spiritual war that's occurring right now

647
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,960
I'm giving you just a little tidbit of

648
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,480
it it's much more vast than that I we

649
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,039
can do 10 shows on it I'm just giving

650
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,360
you a little fraction of of how it goes

651
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,480
a little bit and so we have to respect

652
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,120
that the angels are really busy so but

653
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,159
we also we also have to understand that

654
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,760
the angels are there to help us to too

655
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,159
that they're there looking out for us to

656
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,360
help us too in our time of me need I

657
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,880
want to tell you a little story okay

658
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,480
this is this is a man that came to me I

659
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,720
didn't know him when he was sick I

660
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,320
didn't know him when he was sick he came

661
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,760
to me and he told me that the

662
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,600
Angels the Angels cured him that's what

663
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,640
he told me I had to hear this I had to

664
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:57,200
hear the story so I didn't know him and

665
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,360
um you know this is at one time in his

666
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,519
life and he's been waiting to tell this

667
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,919
story and he wanted to tell it to me and

668
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,480
I said I want to hear this I want to

669
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:11,480
hear this and I was enthralled okay so

670
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,399
he fell ill completely ill he was in

671
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,200
this you know cat catatonic State I mean

672
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:18,480
he was just in this you know paralysis

673
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,080
state of paralysis and he fell ill he

674
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,080
couldn't eat he couldn't even sleep he

675
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,760
couldn't walk he couldn't

676
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,679
talk he was in he was in hospital for

677
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,240
quite quite a long time

678
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,000
and you know for a good long time in the

679
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,000
hospital and then they moved him at home

680
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,600
and it was he it was too hard to work

681
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,799
with him at home he was he was you know

682
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,919
he was on a feeding tube he was on a

683
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,480
breathing apparatus most of the

684
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:51,360
time and he told me that he was awake

685
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,840
and they moved him into um a nursing

686
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,840
home where basically to die and then

687
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,600
from the nursing home you know from the

688
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,159
nursing home home maybe back to the

689
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,559
hospital I think he told me he went back

690
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,559
to the hospital a couple times and back

691
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,159
to the nursing home and he said that he

692
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,080
was conscious he couldn't speak but he

693
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,559
was conscious and he was awake but he

694
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,919
couldn't move he couldn't write he

695
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,240
couldn't do

696
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,919
anything but he was positive he was

697
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,960
going to die at the nursing home he was

698
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,440
just left to die and then he

699
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,039
remembered he

700
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,200
remembered the angel on top of his

701
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:32,840
Christmas tree when he was a

702
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:35,919
child he remembered the angel on top of

703
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,399
the Christmas tree when he was a

704
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,600
child okay and he was just totally

705
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:43,399
hopeless at this point thinking he's

706
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,880
never going to come out of

707
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,799
this and he heard he

708
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,840
heard sometimes in and out of it all the

709
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,320
doctors talking about how it's a mystery

710
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,399
illness they can't see a stroke they

711
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,519
don't know what's causing it but he was

712
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,679
wasting away and he was dying and losing

713
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:05,679
his life and it was just unknown to what

714
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,440
was wrong in and out of the in and out

715
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,799
of the delusion of the

716
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,279
sickness in and out of that but he said

717
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,399
at one time he said when he lost all

718
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,919
hope and he thought he was going to die

719
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,279
and he thought he was going to leave it

720
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,279
it appeared to him to think about the

721
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:25,840
angel on top of his Christmas tree he'll

722
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,039
never forget that angel he said it had

723
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,480
beautiful sparkly wings

724
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,840
it had a soft

725
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Angelic

726
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,960
face and it had Golden

727
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,960
Hair golden

728
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:47,399
hair and it had white like a white Veil

729
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,679
all around it big wings and it sat on

730
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:54,600
top of the tree when he was a child and

731
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,799
then he remembered his aunt had an angel

732
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,559
at her house that was on top

733
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,880
uh it was in it was on the coffee table

734
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,480
in the living room on top of the coffee

735
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,360
table and he remembered that

736
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,760
angel and he said to

737
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,360
himself are there Angels there must be

738
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,960
there must be angels I at least have to

739
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,159
connect to the angels somehow that's

740
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,200
what he said to himself innately because

741
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,240
of not because he was taught about the

742
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,799
Angels he wasn't taught about the Angels

743
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,159
no one taught him about the Angels it

744
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,399
was just on top of the Christmas

745
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,360
tree

746
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,200
and then he envisioned the Christmas

747
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,639
tree angel lit up cuz he remembered that

748
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,760
if the Christmas tree was unplugged the

749
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:40,639
angel on top of the Christmas tree would

750
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,519
would go out and he always liked to see

751
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:45,120
it plugged in and so he would ask his

752
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,240
family to plug it in all the time so the

753
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,799
angel would

754
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,000
light and he remember it lit up and he

755
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,200
remembered it and he remembered the

756
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,760
other angel on the coffee table and all

757
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,240
he could think about instead of

758
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,080
dying instead instead of being sick and

759
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,240
paralyzed instead of wasting away all he

760
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,440
could think about were these

761
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,279
angels and he became

762
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,960
obsessed obsessed in a good way about

763
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,279
these

764
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,240
angels and he called it obsessed that's

765
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,760
what he said to me became obsessed with

766
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,000
them and he said after a few days what

767
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,000
he feels like went a few days by cuz he

768
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,600
couldn't tell time he said after a few

769
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,720
days gone

770
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,080
by he said

771
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,000
that he it was about 3:30 4:00 in the

772
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,440
morning which he feels because it was

773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,679
the summertime and he felt like the

774
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,279
light was about to come out in the

775
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,639
little window when he cracked his eyes

776
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,519
open cuz he could see partially and he

777
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,000
said that he saw some light coming up in

778
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,840
the window and coming up like it looked

779
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,440
like Dawn was

780
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,880
coming and he closed his eye and he went

781
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,960
into some kind of

782
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,120
vision and the vision was seeing Angels

783
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,080
come down come down from the sky and

784
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,799
break through the nursing home to break

785
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,880
through the nursing home ceiling and

786
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:14,159
come down and land on his bed by his

787
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:18,000
side he said there were three or four

788
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,840
Angels standing looking over him

789
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,760
standing over his body he saw these

790
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,399
angels he saw these angels one of the

791
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:32,480
Angels was holding the angel on top of

792
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,080
the Christmas tree in the Angel's hand

793
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,360
to give him the

794
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,440
identifiable message that we have come

795
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,000
to help the Angels did a dance around

796
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,960
him they walked around him he said they

797
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
sat on the bed with him they walked

798
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,159
around and they had joy and they had

799
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,480
happiness and they were

800
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,039
lighthearted they were light-hearted he

801
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,519
said they were free from pain from

802
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:59,919
suffering they they were free from Agony

803
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,679
they were free from

804
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,279
hardship but he said they had compassion

805
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,839
to all compassion could possibly have

806
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:13,440
they had immense compassion and freedom

807
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,280
and a light-hearted nature and a

808
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,159
joyfulness inside of them and around

809
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,119
them and they looked at him and they

810
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,879
touched his body and they said you're

811
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:29,240
going to be okay it's going to be

812
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:33,480
okay and then they left they lifted up

813
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:36,000
and left that morning he started getting

814
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,200
feeling to his body now he was a long

815
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,280
way from Physical Therapy a long way

816
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
from Physical Therapy but he got feeling

817
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,440
in his body and he was able to move his

818
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,119
arms which was witnessed by the nurse in

819
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,879
the nursing home it was witnessed and

820
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,800
from there on he recovered and he

821
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:56,919
recovered rapidly and then went through

822
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,520
physical therapy and recovered and he

823
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:02,440
had to tell me the

824
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,359
story and that's the power of angels so

825
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,960
we have to have some faith we have to

826
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,760
care here's one thing you have to you

827
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,960
have to

828
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,960
know here's one thing the Angels knew he

829
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,720
couldn't speak out loud or speak at all

830
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,119
in order to access the Angels but they

831
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,359
knew that when you're in that kind of

832
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,960
position and you can't access them they

833
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:26,079
will help you they will help you

834
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,359
regardless of being able to voice out to

835
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,119
voice out to the

836
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,680
angels and but one thing you have to do

837
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,839
if you do have a voice and you can speak

838
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,200
like I'm sure most if you can you want

839
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:42,520
to ask out loud you want to definitely

840
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,359
ask out loud it's really important to do

841
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:48,520
that when you ask out loud it's

842
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,800
important it's really important it's

843
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,640
critical

844
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,760
actually and so you you what you do is

845
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,400
you say you know angels can you help me

846
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,079
and you could whisper it you you can say

847
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,400
it louder you don't have to scream it

848
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,480
you don't have to yell it it's that

849
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,680
important because the people that I've

850
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,839
seen ask out loud get the help they need

851
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,760
from the Angels one way or

852
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,400
another and so many people ask for Angel

853
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,520
help but they don't ask for it they just

854
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,640
can't come to asking for it they can't

855
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,520
they can't get themselves to ask for it

856
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,280
or they don't know enough to ask for it

857
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,079
out loud and so they lose that chance

858
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,960
where it's not as easily done and the

859
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,240
reason why is because angels have a hard

860
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,319
time searching through all the Agony you

861
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,839
have meaning all the thoughts you have

862
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:32,839
all the stress you have all the

863
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,760
different things going on in your mind

864
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:37,319
the party that's going on in your brain

865
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,119
and angels have a hard time getting

866
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:41,640
through all that but they look out for

867
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,520
the people who cannot speak that are in

868
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,240
that dire need all that entire dire need

869
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,400
that moment of just just desperate need

870
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,000
and say look out in that case so that's

871
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,560
okay if you can't speak but you want to

872
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,440
be able to ask out loud I was talking to

873
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,200
a friend of mine you know Michael

874
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,800
Bernard Beth Beckwith

875
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,200
and he said when he went through a

876
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,400
situation he said he got the help when

877
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,680
he asked out

878
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,040
loud that's when it hit him that's when

879
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,240
it happened that's when he got help you

880
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,480
know he was out swimming had some

881
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,839
problems with some massive waves and he

882
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,760
had to ask out for help and he called

883
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:22,119
out for help and that's what saved him

884
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,720
the Angelic power the the Angels when he

885
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,000
asked out for help and he felt like if

886
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,839
he didn't ask out for help he wouldn't

887
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,720
have been

888
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,560
saved and so and so if you hear from

889
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,040
other you know Angelic experts or

890
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,640
sources that that's not true that you

891
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,200
don't have to ask out loud no no you do

892
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,760
you do it's critical and you have to

893
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,240
okay that's information that came from

894
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,119
Spirit that came from Spirit that taught

895
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,079
me that you have to ask out loud for

896
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,400
help taught me when I was younger and

897
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,599
how critical that is and it really does

898
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,880
matter now if you to have the inability

899
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,560
to ask out loud that's a different story

900
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,960
and that's when the Angels come for a

901
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,560
different reason they come with the help

902
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,160
and that's okay so I want to talk about

903
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,800
the life-changing Angels the

904
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,400
lifechanging

905
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,920
angels are very interesting because

906
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,880
they're different than all the other

907
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,599
Angels they're different the

908
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,839
life-changing angels have everything to

909
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,960
do with food that gets to you that gets

910
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,400
on your table food that gets in your

911
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,400
hands food that grows seeds that get

912
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,280
what they need so they can grow and feed

913
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,760
the planet and Feed Us

914
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,680
angels that have everything to do with

915
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,160
our digestion and digest you digesting

916
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,240
food and consuming

917
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,359
food angels that play a role in

918
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,960
everything in anything that has to do

919
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:49,240
with your well-being and health related

920
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,760
to food food issues food Gran the rain

921
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,400
the weather all of this combined

922
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,680
including protecting bees which right

923
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,000
now it's not an easy job for angels to

924
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,520
protect bees they're trying to protect

925
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,240
them wherever they can because bees are

926
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,640
a critical part of our life and us being

927
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,880
here because they're the ultimate

928
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,760
pollinators to keep our food supply

929
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,680
going so that we

930
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,200
survive so let's talk about some of

931
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,160
these life-changing angels and and

932
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,599
here's the thing if you if you think you

933
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,280
don't have a lot of faith or you think

934
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,200
you don't have any faith and you even

935
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,079
believe in an angel you have faith

936
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,079
remember that build off of that try to

937
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,040
build off of that so if you're someone

938
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,880
who thinks you're lacking some Faith or

939
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,000
you don't have enough faith and you're

940
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,680
concerned your your faith is really low

941
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,839
or maybe you just don't have any faith

942
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:45,319
at all if you believe in angels even

943
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,760
just a little bit your faith is building

944
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:53,079
up that's the practice right there that

945
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,280
alone so there's 12 lifechanging angels

946
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,880
that are out

947
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,880
there and and these Ang angels are they

948
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,200
responsible for major

949
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,680
tasks and they're like for instance some

950
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,319
of these angels are trying to win the

951
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,839
war on GMO crops and some of these

952
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,800
angels are communicating with the people

953
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,760
that are

954
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,680
responsible for making GMO awareness as

955
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,440
being a bad thing so they're getting

956
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,920
Angelic help without even realizing it

957
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,640
so there's Angels responsible with

958
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,960
trying to actually help with the whole

959
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,359
GMO crop thing that's going on GMO

960
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,880
destru

961
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,760
so there's Angels involved and those

962
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,560
same angels are trying to trip up the

963
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,760
GMO

964
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
factories they are they're working on

965
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,599
constantly trying to trip them up it's a

966
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,359
hard job and there's a lot to do so

967
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,000
let's go over some of these angels

968
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,240
there's one Angel called angel of

969
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,760
disarmament okay this is a life-changing

970
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,079
Angel so it's it's when you have to eat

971
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,599
produce you know it has that you know

972
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,079
it's been sprayed by pesticides or

973
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,119
herbicides or fungicides but so you're

974
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,359
you have to eat conventional produce

975
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,920
there's people out there that have to

976
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,640
eat you know conventional produce

977
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,200
absolutely and it's okay it's okay as

978
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,119
long as you're getting that avocado in

979
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,680
you get the conventional avocado if you

980
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,440
have to you know get the conventional

981
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,560
celery just give it a good washing which

982
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,760
of course there's going to still be

983
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,280
residues inside of it but the point is

984
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,839
is don't stop eating fruits and

985
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,760
vegetables just because you you have no

986
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,319
choice because of financial reasons or

987
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,119
availability and resources to e

988
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,520

989
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,720

food has been sprayed and you have no

992
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,440
choice but to eat it or even be being

993
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,119
contaminated by GMO

994
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,000
crops okay you can call upon this Angel

995
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,000

996
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,200
could have the minimal effect on your

body body protecting you now I asked

998
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Spirit about this angel I said well can

the angel literally get rid of every

1000
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,720
pesticide inside of that food and spirit

1001
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,480
said no but they can actually minimize

1002
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,200
the effect it has on your body so what

1003
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:18,200
this Angel does is this Angel actually

1004
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,280
helps your body handle whatever minimal

1005
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,480
whatever pesticide or herbicide that's

1006
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,160
on that conventional produce to handle

1007
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:29,800
it and so you can process it and

1008
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,760
eliminate that pesticide with ease so it

1009
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,520
helps that process happen so you can

1010
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,720
call upon the angel of disarm let me

1011
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,599

or say you got a big Garden you know I

1017
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:52,400
ran across somebody that has such a big

1018
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,040
Garden that I couldn't believe it it was

1019
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,920
massive I was like this is this is crazy

1020
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,160

1021
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,960
and so if you you know if you're growing

1022
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,839
your own anything herbs if you're

1023
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,480
growing your own herbs in a planter some

1024
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:07,440
Rosemary some time or if you got an

1025
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,960
apple tree whatever it is and you're

1026
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,280
growing your own food you want to call

1027
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,839
upon the angel

1028
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,880
abundance so that she gives you more of

1029
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,480
a bountiful crop and she can if you call

1030
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,440
upon her and nobody knows about her

1031
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,760
nobody knows about her you're hearing

1032
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,599
this for the first time here you're

1033
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,319
you're hearing it here and it's in the

1034
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,559
lifechanging Foods book but the

1035
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:31,440
information has to get out there the one

1036
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,440
thing I like about Spirit a spirit

1037
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,400
really knows which Angels really exist

1038
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,680
and which angels are out there because

1039
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,440
it's coming from Spirit it's not coming

1040
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,920
from just you know you know just a

1041
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,839
thought process that we have kind of in

1042
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,200
our head this is coming from a spiritual

1043
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:49,280
source so I just I love when spirit

1044
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,160
gives me these angels for us so we can

1045
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,240
help really get the help you need and

1046
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,839
get this information out there and I

1047
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,079
promise spirit I would actually make

1048
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,359
sure this information got out there it's

1049
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,920
important angel of

1050
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:05,839
provision I love the angel of provision

1051
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,400
her job is to root food to people who

1052
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,880
are undernourished or

1053
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,200
starving so people who are

1054
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,160
undernourished and starving the angel of

1055
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,440
provision has the power to somehow get

1056
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,640
food sources to these very limited

1057
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,040
places and people and soup K kitchens

1058
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,359
and food banks they're responsible these

1059
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,720
angels for getting people to actually

1060
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:31,240
create food banks that's the whole point

1061
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,559
of why somebody wakes up in the morning

1062
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,599
and says I'm going to start a soup

1063
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,240
kitchen to help people that are

1064
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,440
starving that's getting that's a message

1065
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,839
coming from the angel of provision but

1066
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,480
the angel of provision gets no

1067
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:46,880
credibility no credit no

1068
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,400
respect no respect because the angel

1069
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,880
provision doesn't need any respect it's

1070
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,880
not like you know people who they need

1071
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,480
to have respect or whatever so the angel

1072
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,880
provision these are the most taken for

1073
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,319
granted angels of all time that are in

1074
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,200
life-changing Foods book so so so it's

1075
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,559
about getting someone to start a soup

1076
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,839
kitchen literally providing nourishment

1077
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,400
