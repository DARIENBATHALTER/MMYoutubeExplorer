00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,920
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:49,280
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,239
William let's talk about fruit fear and

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,039
how dangerous fruit fear has become they

16
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,039
lied to you and they lie straight to

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,480
your face so that you do the dirty work

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,159
for them and spread their lies and

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,560
disinformation far and wide over time

20
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,280
they rob and steal any chance for you to

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:17,119
heal they keep you lost and scared and

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:21,280
keep you in fear fruit is bad fruit can

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,680
harm you fruit can kill you avoid fruit

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,840
they say there's some realities you must

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,840
know about the war on fruit did you hear

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,119
that I said the war on fruit

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,560
yeah and where it's leading us in our

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,560
coming days the results of what happens

29
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,680
when fruit fear in the health movement

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,520
completely gets its way and no one wants

31
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,520
to eat any fruit because they're totally

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,640
afraid and scared so let me give you a

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,880
picture of what will take place not too

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,000
far off in the distant future and so let

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,039
me tell you a story so let's go into it

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,840
now the demand for fruit grows smaller

37
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,600
and smaller as as the years go by

38
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,319
grocery stores worldwide are throwing

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,599
away more and more fruit because people

40
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,760
aren't buying it this leads us to the

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,800
health food stores and grocery stores

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,239
ordering less and less fruit fruit

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,160
juices such as apple juice and other

44
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:24,879
organic Whole Food pure juices just sit

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,879
on the store shelves and collect dust

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,879
and no more is restocked and ordered

47
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:35,319
because of the fear spread by the fruit

48
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,519
demonizer that 100% pure organic juices

49
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,080
are dangerous for your health and can

50
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,519
even kill you more and more anti fruit

51
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,480
propaganda keeps on being promoted

52
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,560
nonstop without any science and research

53
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:55,000
showing us evidence that fruit is bad

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,239
for us Fruit Farms Orchards orange

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,640
groves Bramble Farms watermelon patches

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,159
melon patches banana Farms pineapple

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:07,280
Farms are not making enough money to

58
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,000
keep equipment running and Manpower they

59
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,400
just shut down land that's owned by

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
these fruit farmers both small farms and

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
big farms have to burn their Orchards

62
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,000
and Groves down in order to clear the

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,799
land to try to reestablish a new way of

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,400
living fruit farm land that is least

65
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,560
they build housing on and also burn all

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,000
the Orchards down the amount of burning

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,239
worldwide of these fruit trees and

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,879
brambles will be

69
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,319
catastrophic this will admit tremendous

70
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,439
amounts of smoke and Ash into the

71
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,239
atmosphere hindering Wildlife

72
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,280
globally and because there's that much

73
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,760
ancient fruit land and Farms that have

74
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
been here feeding the populations for

75
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,519
hundreds of years and when it goes up in

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,360
flames it's

77
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
disastrous every season as the fruit

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,280
naturally drops and sits on the ground

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,200
in The Orchards it feeds animals and

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Wildlife like deer and moose bear Fox

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,040
birds and other Wildlife before winter

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,280
comes it keeps them alive and gives them

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,280
a fighting chance to survive the Year

84
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,160
this disappears and so does a large

85
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,320
portion of wildlife that has been

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,800
feeding on Fallen fruit for hundreds of

87
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,360
years bees already are losing the

88
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,479
ability to thrive in the future they're

89
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,520
lack last chance of survival will end

90
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,639
with the loss of the blossoms from the

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,160
cherry blossoms apple blossoms pear

92
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,039
blossoms Peach blossoms nectarine

93
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,440
blossoms and Plum blossoms and

94
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,600
watermelon blossoms and virtually every

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,039
other

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,120
fruit bees rely on fruit trees and their

97
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,280
fruit blossoms worldwide to sustain and

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,880
survive and because there aren't enough

99
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,680
wild flowers to feed them already never

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
mind in the future they're going to

101
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,720
suffer greatly

102
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,080
experts in the health field are unaware

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,639
of this environmental change that's on

104
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,639
its way and the ecosystem shift that

105
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:13,960
will occur fruit is one of the most

106
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,680
important parts of our ecosystem without

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,720
its balanced it will be thrown off and

108
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,759
it will trigger famine and loss of life

109
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,000
and the slow destruction of our

110
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:30,520
environment on an inner way and every

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,479
way meat butter milk cheese yogurt has

112
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,240
become scarce and hard to find without

113
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,280
the pollinators it will affect

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,199
livestock grass-fed beef from grass-fed

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,440
cows don't eat grass only they are in

116
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,680
the fields eating wild flowers from

117
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,800
herbs that prevent the cows from getting

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,479
disease with the loss of the pollinators

119
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Bine viruses and bacteria will dominate

120
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
and livestock will have to be put down

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,199
in the masses because the bees spread

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,759
immune system building properties to

123
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:08,520
each Wildflower for the cow to consume

124
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,800
and now that the bees are gone the cows

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,720
at graze are not getting their

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,560
medicine phytochemical compounds pass

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,520
from flower to Flower by the bees in the

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,639
fields the livestock grze in support

129
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,360
their immune system meanwhile Health

130
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,400
influencers on social media will Echo

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,840
the no fruit propaganda more than ever

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
before while they are battling their new

133
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,520
found symptoms and conditions not

134
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,199
realizing how important fruit was and is

135
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,800
for the world or their own healing

136
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,599
process the largest percent of the food

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,520
supply for the bees are fruit trees and

138
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:50,960
fruit blossoms now that these are gone

139
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,639
there will be pockets of be famine in

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,759
areas all around the world where they

141
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,120
just disappear quickly until they're

142
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,840
finally finished and when the bees are

143
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,280
gone the butterfly flies follow and

144
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,440
these Godly pollinators are a big part

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,039
of how our whole food chain survives

146
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,360
honey which is a medicine that will be

147
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,039
needed in the future because of our

148
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,520
broken immune systems and the viral

149
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,520
plagues to come will be rare and too

150
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,360
pricey for almost anyone to purchase

151
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,680
propolis will be a critical Hidden Gem

152
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,560
that is sparse and needed and finally

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,960
disappears hummingbirds that migrate in

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,360
the spring rely on fruit blossoms to

155
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,680
survive because there's not enough wild

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,080
flowers in Blossom during the spring so

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,520
large portions of the hummingbirds will

158
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,919
disappear and die because they can't

159
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,520
make their Journey without the fruit

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,120
blossoms then there's the industries

161
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,879
that will capitalize on The

162
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,159
Disappearance of fruit fruit flavorings

163
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
will explode in the marketplace

164
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,039
synthetic fruit flavorings that will be

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,919
deemed safe by paid for science and

166
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,960
research will be in high demand because

167
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,199
of the loss of the real fruit in the

168
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,159
world and people will long for Fruity

169
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,159
sweet flavoring of raspberry strawberry

170
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,000
and

171
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:18,039
watermelon the chemical industry will go

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,680
into production and the amount of

173
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:24,080
chemical byproduct produced will be

174
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,360
destroying the ecosystem even more

175
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,960
children will never get to experience

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,319
eating a piece of fruit in their

177
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,279
childhood and won't receive bioavailable

178
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,240
vitamin C and other antiviral compounds

179
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,039
from fresh fruit during a critical time

180
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,560
their immune system is in development

181
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,279
infertility will be on the rise more

182
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,160
than ever before women's reproductive

183
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,440
system diseases will worsen and be at a

184
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,120
level we have never even dreamed of

185
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,000
women's diets will be lacking fruit more

186
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,120
so than ever before it will be rare a

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,399
woman has one piece of of fruit a year

188
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,800
which will worsen infertility and this

189
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,720
will threaten the existence of the human

190
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,240
race how did we get to this place at

191
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,800
this point in time in the future no one

192
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,040
realized that they were being used and

193
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,920
lied to about fruit so let's talk about

194
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,680
today you guys did you ever think about

195
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,240
what could happen like if fruit is just

196
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,720
done like gone there's a Tipping Point

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,640
where stuff just goes wrong just like

198
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,440
when someone's sick and they get sicker

199
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
and sicker and sicker there's a Tipping

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,560
Point there too that you never want to

201
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,959
be in or never want to go to so in the

202
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,279
present moment right now women's

203
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,800
infertility is on the rise you know

204
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,519
fibroids endometriosis PCOS reproductive

205
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,240
cysts reproductive cancers because women

206
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,279
aren't eating enough fruit that's

207
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,160
actually a part of it I mean there's a

208
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,760
lot of part of it but that's a part of

209
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,640
it there a lot of pieces instead women

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,320
are told to eat eggs eggs that's what

211
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,560
they're told to do it's like replace

212
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,519
fruit something that's been around

213
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,000
forever and just no just eggs replace

214
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,800
everything I guess because that's what

215
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,399
it is is everybody's told to eat eggs

216
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
which ironically eggs worse in

217
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,360
reproductive system conditions by

218
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,360
feeding the very viruses that cause

219
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,040
women's reproductive system diseases and

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,480
symptoms and conditions right and so

221
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,519
I've talked about that for eggs feed

222
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,360
viruses viruses that are in the

223
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:42,440
reproductive system creating fibroids

309
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,839
going to drop a whole bunch of more

310
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,519
stuff you guys don't know and it's this

311
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,680
it infected a part of the alternative

312
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,680
medicine world

313
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,959
Jeepers it got to the herbalist who once

314
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,959
knew fruit was good for us many years

315
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,519
ago it got to the Cairo in the village

316
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,320
the chiropractor in the village who

317
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,000
never had a problem with bananas until

318
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,759
now forget it chiropractor is not going

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,040
to recommend bananas anymore very few

320
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,240
have ever unless they got reignited by

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
fruit information that's been spreading

322
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,759

stay away from those sweet apples the

330
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,160

348
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,199
heard that before right yeah yeah it's

349
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,120
unbelievable and any other condition you

350
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,759
can think of so fruit was weaponized oh

351
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,600
man how can like something that like

352
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,759
simple something that pure something

353
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,639
that natural be weaponizing like

354
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,079
weaponized like what is he talking about

355
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,399
right you're probably like thinking it

356
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,639
was weaponized it was weaponized

357
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,839
purposely against the chronically ill

358
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,000
the underdog it was weaponized against

359
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,480
the underdog slowly against the

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
chronically ill not all at once though

361
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,279
this is a slow progression and it's

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,839
kicking in gear more and more and here's

363
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:42,440
the thing you guys partly why it's slow

364
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,440
is because people's Common Sense

365
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,880
understands that fruit probably isn't

366
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,680
bad that's what's funny everybody's

367
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,519
Common Sense knows somewhere in the back

368
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,360
of their mind somewhere in the back of

369
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,440
their skull somewhere in there that

370
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,399
fruit is actually good or fruit can't be

371

374
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,480
fruit take down this weaponizing the war

375
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,919
on fruit take longer because people are

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,319
like not totally getting tricked they're

377
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,120
just like what and so people still eat a

378
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:25,360
little bit of fruit in places so the

379
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,880
industries planted fruit demonizes in

380
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,160
health movement and this is the next

381
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,760
part I'm going to talk about the

382
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,360
industries planted fruit haters fruit

383
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:41,120

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,880
good intentioned health experts good

385
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,440
intentioned health

386
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:50,280
authorities that fruit was bad and then

387
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,840
have that shrinkle down to local Hol

388
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,960
holistic health experts like in your

389
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,600

know and trainers and all kinds of

393
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
people have incredible intentions that

394
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,159
actually want their people better and

395
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,880
stronger but they get totally

396
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:14,480
confused and that's how it worked they

397
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,600
became convinced that fruit is harmful

398
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,679
for anyone so they attack Fruit on

399
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,400
social media in the doctor's offices

400
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,880
this doesn't mean that everyone who fell

401
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,679
sucker into this attack on fruit is

402
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
involved so I don't want you thinking if

403
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,880
someone is ripping down fruit ripping it

404
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,280
apart right you're like oh my God they

405
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,159
must be one of those planted people in

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,280
the industry that you know no that's not

407
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:43,320
it it I'll talk about who those might be

408
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:48,480
in a minute but it's spreading like

409
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:52,120
wildfire by good people not purposely

410
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,799
but it got to all the good people and so

411
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,280
all the good people with good intentions

412
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,440
doing good stuff in health they're like

413
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,960
no fruit's bad stay away from it watch

414
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,520
out no sweet fruit fruits don't eat that

415
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:06,760
don't eat this okay but there are

416
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,640
certain individuals that played a role

417
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,919
in starting this fruit fear in the

418
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,120
beginning they started the war on fruit

419
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:20,039
and started the lie that fruit causes

420
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:23,039
harm it was a bad seed man planted in a

421
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:27,200
dark way to bring us where we are today

422
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:31,159
with no merit no science no evidence no

423
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:35,400
proof in any way way that fruit causes

424
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:38,039
anything or is bad for you no proof and

425
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,799
even the most basic lie of all at the

426
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:43,000
start that fruit feeds candida or fruit

427
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,799
causes

428
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,360
candida you know an apple doesn't feed

429
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,360
candida you guys but chocolate cake will

430
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,039
you know vegan or animal-based chocolate

431
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,679
cake so let's talk about what what's in

432
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,240
Fruit let's go into that a little bit

433
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,200
cuz I think that's important right there

434
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,039
trace minerals did is that something you

435
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
don't want in you trace minerals is that

436
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,080
bad uh phytochemical compounds that are

437
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,840
critical for healing like anti-cancerous

438
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,200
compounds wait a minute fruits loaded up

439
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,600
with anti-cancerous compounds uh you

440
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,520
don't want that in you um vitamin C you

441
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,679
don't want that in you either right no

442
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,320
that's bad vitamin C uh anti-cancerous

443
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:25,360
compounds antiviral compounds are in

444
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,760
Fruit oh you don't want that in you

445
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,919
especially right now with what's going

446
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,080

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,440
don't you don't want antiviral compounds

450
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,679
that's in Fruit antibacterial compounds

451
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,159
antifungal compounds nutrients totally

452
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,520
packed with nutrients all kinds

453
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,919
undiscovered also antioxidants Living

454
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,440
Water critical glucose no everybody

455
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,640
would rather not have any fruit but

456
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,559
drink some maybe coffee from a coffee

457
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,120
shop that has straight tap water right

458
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,880
from City tap water and but stay away

459
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,120
from a piece of fruit with living water

460
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:11,360
in it that's pure and you know what else

462
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,520
properties so everybody's freaking out

463
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,840

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,880
5 in long that's really just some food

467
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,679
all like interwined and wrapped around

468
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,159
itself and or maybe you know I always

469
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,320
tell people the matter what if you're

470
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,279
going to see a worm go in the toilet it

471
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,039
better be moving and it better be

472
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,080
swimming then you can guarantee that was

473
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,799
a worm and but I'll tell you right now

474
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,320
fruit has worm expelling

475
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,799
properties what's in Fruit they say that

476
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,000
they say okay the demonizer say sugar

477
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,840
and sugar is bad so hey you you know

478
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,240
that right sugar is bad you hear it all

479
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,840
the time that's what you hear fruit

480
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,880

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,360
with without sugar you die interesting

482
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,080
so without sugar you die uh that's a

483
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,039
funny one did you know every single

484
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:15,720
movement you make task you do thought

485
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:18,679
you think uh words you speak hello is

486
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,840
because of glucose that's

487
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:24,559
glucose and there are sugar in the foods

488
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,760
you think have no sugar check this out

489
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,159
all right let's go into it a little bit

490
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:34,640
there is sugar in Foods you think ain't

491
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,640
got no sugar all right meat for example

492
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,120
I can't have sugar in it meat are you

493
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:44,960
kidding caramelized sugar when you cook

494
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,400
meat it's caramelized sugar in there

495
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,279
where' it come from well no one talks

496
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,880
about it because I guess nobody knows or

497
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:54,720
something let me tell you where it comes

498
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,640
from it comes from the blood of the

499
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,840
animal which was loaded with sugar

500
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,799
glucose the animal can only survive say

501
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,279
like a cow eating grass which is sweet

502
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,640
believe it or not right down to the root

503
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:14,440
there's a lot of Sweetness in there all

504
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,960
that Sugar from that grass all right

505
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,279
that gets munched up and munched up and

506
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:24,520
and basically Juiced in that cow's mouth

507
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:28,400
and that sugar right there is their

508
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:32,440
glucose for grassfed beef and and the

509
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,480
animal's blood sugar so it could survive

510
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,679
and stay strong and

511
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,799
Thrive so when you cook a piece of meat

512
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,919
which I'm Pro meat I'm Pro plant-based

513
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,440
too you know but when you cook a piece

514
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,200
of meat because that's what you like if

515
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,400
that's what you like when you're cooking

516
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,320
it there's sugar in it and then when

517
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,600
you're cooking it it

518
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,880
caramelizes that's what happens with

519
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,120
sugar the minute you put heat to it the

520
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,559
minute you cook with it it caramelizes

521
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,840
so that's that's the the blood sugar and

522
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,679
it's never measured it's not measured on

523
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,360
any scale science and research doesn't

524
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,880
care about it no I just care about

525
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,400
protein they don't care about the sugar

526
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,559
and meat you know they never dial it in

527
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,880
they will never tell you how much sugar

528
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,159
is in a piece of meat or Animal product

529
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,919
and this isn't an anti-animal product

530
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
campaign I don't have a diet belief

531
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,120
system anybody who's know knows medical

532
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,559
medium information is whatever diet

533
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,360
belief system you have I'm about

534
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,279
plugging in powerful tools so you can

535
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,919
make it work work for your belief so you

536
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:36,520
can heal so I'm Pro meat I'm Pro

537
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,520
plant-based but listen without sugar you

538
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,559
hit the floor you lay down and you

539
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:45,480
slowly die and there is sugar in the

540
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,919
foods that you love that are fat-based

541
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,679
so you're thinking that's ridiculous I

542
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,200
don't die when I eat all my fatty foods

543
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:57,399
I'm not dying yeah because avocado has

544
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,240
sugar in it avocado has plenty of sugar

545
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:01,559
in it by the way hey you know remember

546
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
that story I told you at the beginning

547
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,320
in this podcast avocados won't be around

548
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,320
either in the future cuz they're going

549
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,440
to need to be pollinated by a lot of

550
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,520
bees in order to keep the supply of

551
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,640
avocados going and avocados hey if you

552
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,279
love them and they're part of our trendy

553
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,840
diet now they won't be here in the

554
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,960
future cuz the bees will be gone if the

555
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,039
war on fruit continues there won't be

556
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,320
any more bees there won't be enough

557
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:30,520
avocado trees or bees this is say people

558
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,720
who love them you know byebye avocado

559
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,320
toast it's gone it's

560
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,799
toast which is kind of funny because

561
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,679
toast anyway which is sugar even though

562
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,520
it's gluten-free it's still sugar but

563
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,120
you didn't think you eat really any

564
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,080
sugar right because a lot of people say

565
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't eat any sugar really and they're

566
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,720
like hey I'm really enjoying my avocado

567
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,200
toast which is great because avocados

568
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,679
are the healthiest one of the healthiest

569
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,559
fats right if you're going to have fats

570
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,440
it's one of them but think about that

571
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,679
there's plenty of sugar in the avocado

572
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,320
cuz that's what keeps you functioning

573
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,200
it's that sugar and in that gluten-free

574
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,840
toast it's sugar but don't eat a piece

575
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,279
of fruit have that but never touch fruit

576
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,000
oh it's bad because it's sugar fruit's

577
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:15,120
sugar now and so don't touch a piece of

578
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,360
fruit but have avocado toast which the

579
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,600
toast is sugar basically straight sugar

580
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,159
it's all sugar and then avocado which

581
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,760
has sugar in it there is sugar in nuts

582
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,200
and seeds too you guys your nut Butters

583
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,200
peanut butter almond butter

584
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,240
that sugar is what allows you to

585
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,960
function it's not the fat allowing you

586
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,039
to function and keeping your brain

587
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,840
functioning but that's what someone

588
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,320
wants you to believe that was planted

589
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,320
quite a few years back you know one of

590
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,600
the moles the plants the fruit demonizes

591
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,480
paid for to actually distract people

592
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,799
scare them out of fruit creating fruit

593
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,159
fear along the way they were there for a

594
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:01,559
reason to try to sabotage fruit this is

595
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,279
the waron fruit the milk cheese butter

596
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,880
yogurt kefir people eat it's all got

597
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:10,039
sugar in it did you know that it's the

598
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,600
lactose so here you are you're having

599
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:14,559
your cheese you're having your milk

600
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,440
you're having your butter you know

601
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,880
Butter's got a sweet Edge to it it's all

602
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,960
got sugar in it nut milks have sugar in

603
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,039
it oat milk is sweet and they even add

604
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,120
some sugar in it too so I see people

605
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,279
they're like no I don't do fruit I won't

606
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,000
touch any fruit and they're pouring

607
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:35,320
their oatmeal milk you know from a

608
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,360
container on their food and in the

609
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,360
container it even says added sugar it's

610
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,039
got like cane sugar in there added to

611
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,600
their oat milk it's got like agave

612
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,279
nectar added to the oat milk it's got

613
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,960
like coconut sugar added like all kinds

614
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,919
of things natural flavoring which is

615
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
sugar too they put a little sugar in

616
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,039
natural flavoring they're allowed to do

617
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,120
that and and not say it so so it's like

618
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:04,880
okay let's just pour sugar on top of my

619
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,640
sugar and does that make any sense but

620
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,519
never touch a piece of fruit because

621
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,080
we're we're afraid of fruit We Exist

622
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,480
because of sugar but most of those Foods

623
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,399
I mentioned earlier don't even have

624
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,519
enough of it or any antiviral compounds

625
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:25,799
like I said antibacterial compounds

626
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:28,080
antimicrobial compounds phytochemical

627
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,399
compounds critical an

628
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,360
antioxidants and immune building

629
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,200
properties but fruit does what's

630
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,480
interesting is we're being told not to

631
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,559
eat fruit by people who don't know why

632
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,640
we are sick so you walk around with a

633
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,960
symptom you walk around with a condition

634
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,919
and nobody knows why you're sick because

635
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,200
research and science doesn't know and

636
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,679
there's no answers to why you have a

637
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,080
condition they just tag it as autoimmune

638
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,480
or something but not give you any

639
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,240
answers cause unknown that's the saddest

640
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,840
part chronic illness is on the rise and

641
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,000
it's not from the one banana someone

642
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:12,200
eats a month or the one apple they eat

643
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,159
every 3 months no one even eats fruit I

644
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,399
mean I bet you guys like plenty of you

645
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,600
out there listening right now don't even

646
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,440
eat any fruit right I mean it's not on

647
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,720
your radar and some people do and if

648
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,360
they do they don't eat much at all and

649
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,039
by the way the world is sitting in the

650
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,240
dentist office chair

651
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,120
right now getting their teeth drilled I

652
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,720
mean that's the thing like our world

653
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,440
that we live in now people by the Yeah

654
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,200
billions are in you know they're in the

655
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,440
dentist office and they're getting their

656
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,440
teeth drilled and it's not because of

657
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,559
fruit we could even argue it's because

658
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,960
they are not eating enough fruit you

659
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,880
know you might have had some fruit a

660
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,600
moment in your life a little bit and

661
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,480
then a dentist blamed a cavity on it but

662
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,679
billions of people are not touching

663
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:06,880
fruit and getting root canals implants

664
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:10,120
teeth drilled Bridges all day long no

665
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,960
matter what but fruit gets the blame the

666
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:17,799
irony is is it gets the blame more than

667
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:20,919
junkie sweets do right now like right

668
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,640
now at this time we're in Fruit gets

669
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,200
more blame for problems than junky

670
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,000
sweets right now and chocolate Delights

671
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,240
and cane sugar

672
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,679
you guys eating chocolate but you're

673
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,320
afraid of fruit I'm just wondering right

674
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,000
there there's a lot of people I've seen

675
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,279
out there and I talk to and stuff and

676
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,320

self-care meals with coconut sugar cane

684
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,159
sugar gluten-free grains and those

685
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,399
sugars and chocolates won't get the

686
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:03,480
blame ever they'll never get the blame

687
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:08,080
now no way not with the war on fruit

688
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,799
going on but fruit will H it's

689
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,240
interesting right chewing that for a

690
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:16,320
minute think about it you guys check

691
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,600
this out the same people who sabotage

692
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,720
fruit in the health industry back over a

693
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,039
decade ago also

694
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,200
simultaneously started pushing

695
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:33,240
disinformation that are brain runs on

696
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:36,760
fat not sugar it happened at the same

697
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,279
time okay the same time same time the

698
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,519
sabotage happened all right the

699
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,440
propagandists and fruit demonizes the

700
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,440
paid for people involved the moles and

701
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,880
plants they did a

702
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,679
Switcheroo fruit is bad but your brain

703
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:57,760
runs on fat now the new rule no signs

704
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:02,480
behind it just runs on fat now and and

705
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:06,039
if we eat sugar we gain fat and fruit

706
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,360
makes you gain fat is what they say

707
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:12,200
interesting the same early crew that was

708
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,399
planted by a dark industry and put

709
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:19,480
people into Fruit fear also push the

710
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,880
high fat Trend that defies Common Sense

711
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,760
saying sugar from fruit makes you gain

712
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,639
weight but all the fat you eat doesn't

713
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,840
and you know what this add part is about

714
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:33,080
that think about it other health

715
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,120
professionals buy into it and then

716
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,360
spread it around first of all people

717
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,000
don't eat enough fruit that's not why

718
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,840
they're gaining weight look come on

719
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,399
let's be straight you've been tricked

720
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,799
bottom line fat makes you gain fat in

721
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:55,200
the end not fructose natural sugar

722
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:59,679
that's in an apple a pear a watermelon a

723
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:04,120
kiwi doesn't make you fat Okay a kiwi

724
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,720
okay okay a kiwi is not going to make

725
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,559
you fat but will what will make you gain

726
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,039
weight is fatty

727
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,399
meals you see right there so what will

728
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:18,159
make you gain weight is the fatty meals

729
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,919
that causes a stagnant sluggish liver

730
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,240
medical medium information that put it

731
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,240
out there okay quite a while is way back

732
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,840
so it causes a stagnant sluggish liver

733
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,399
when you're eating all those fatty meals

734
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,039
that's all and your then your liver is

735
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:34,840
already filled with Metals toxic heavy

736
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,159
metals bugs fats from a lifetime of

737
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,840
eating fatty foods of all kinds healthy

738
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,840
or not healthy or not fats healthy fats

739
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,080
or not and in each person the weight

740
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,039
comes on at different times in their

741
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,840
life because your liver has a tipping

742
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,639
scale too that does before it gets sick

743
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,799
and all of a sudden gets stagnant and

744
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:58,840
sluggish depending on each person and

745
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:01,159
get guess what all right come on let's

746
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,799
be honest let's be honest with ourselves

747
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:06,760
let's not me a denial about this fruit

748
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,679
isn't doing it no one even eats fruit

749
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,119
really and the amount of fruit they eat

750
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,919
is really so small it's

751
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,919
ridiculous it wasn't the sugar in a

752
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,240
chocolate chip cookie or the blueberry

753
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:24,000
in the blueberry muffin gluten-free or

754
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,280
not that made you gain weight it was the

755
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:31,320
fat in the food the oils in the cookie

756
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,639
or muffin the fat in the eggs the fat in

757
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,599
the chocolate yeah the fat in the

758
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,639
chocolate the fat in the milk the fat in

759
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,040
the butter the canola oil think about it

760
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,480
you better work out in the gym two hours

761
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,280
a day while you're young still young and

762
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,040
feeling strong whatever and you just

763
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,280
better be in the gym three hours a day

764
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,040
so you can eat all that fat and you know

765
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,240
and not touch fruit until finally it

766
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,520
catches up to you and you know no matter

767
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,200
how hard you work off you're just

768
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,879
working out you're like what is this why

769
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,879
am I gaining weight

770
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,119
think about it any snack treat Delight

771
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,280
gluten-free or not you have had has fat

772
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,960
and sugar combined and no one is talking

773
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,560
about that fact that it has fat and

774
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,920
sugar combined they're acting like all

775
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,000
is great all is great but don't eat that

776
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,920
piece of fruit cuz it's sugar see where

777
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,760
you're tricked out you see where you're

778
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,680
tricked out you know I'm just being

779
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:31,320
straight out honest because that you

780
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,440
know yeah and each new generation of

781
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,680
young adults whose parents made them

782
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,160
scrambled eggs lovingly in the morning

783
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,079
and then they went out for pizzas at

784
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,040
night end up getting their first

785
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,440
symptoms maybe some bloating maybe some

786
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,960
acne maybe some eczema maybe some brain

787
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,079
fog fatigue or a little weight gain

788
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,560
listen to some health podcast out there

789
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,079
and instantly get scared to death of

790
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,359
fruit that's how it works so it's not

791
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,960
doing the younger generation's Justice

792
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:03,680
for sure cuz they just getting fed total

793
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,520
misinformation and then they end up

794
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,880
believing every ridiculous unfounded

795
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,880
logic defying deception about fruit and

796
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,640
then they Echo it that's how it's done

797
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,359
and yes yeah they get taught to eat

798
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,720
healthier sure right younger Generations

799
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,319
now it's pretty amazing you get a

800
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,760
symptom and you get taught to eat

801
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:27,400
healthier like Whole Foods no gluten no

802
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,480
processed food maybe balanced

803
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,160
diet and now they're eating more eggs on

804
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,079
their salads they're trying to do some

805
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,160
food combining twists and turns and

806
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,760
they're doing some fermented foods

807
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,240
healthier oils cuz wow I heard this oil

808
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,319
is healthy and avocado toast uh

809
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:48,800
gluten-free toast protein shakes and

810
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:52,760
sure it's an upgrade until they get

811
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,079
sicker later or sick again later and

812
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,119
they're still not eating

813
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,720
fruit while there's while they're

814
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,319
looking for the next diet belief system

815
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,960
like where do I go what do I do I got a

816
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,480
symptom I got another symptom I was

817
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,680
doing good pretty good being off

818
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,800
processed foods now where do I go I'll

819
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,359
go plant-based no wait I'll go animal

820
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,880
based which one do I jump into you know

821
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,400
what's funny fruit is so

822
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,359
demonized that you're encouraged to eat

823
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,640
cacao with caffeine in it which tastes

824
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,200
awful on its own and add sugar to it to

825
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,640
sweeten it and it's heralded as God so

826
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,200
cacao

827
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,200
right take sugar put it into it and no

828
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,400
one talks about the added sugar

829
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,960
everybody talks about fruit being crap

830
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,359
fruit's crap it's sugar it's bad for you

831
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,119
but Cacao is heralded as God see how

832
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,960
Darkness works I'm not saying you can't

833
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,599
have your chocolate I'm just saying the

834
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,240
caffeine industry is even part of this

835
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,560
whole gig all right but you're not

836
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,079
allowed to pick a piece of fruit off a

837
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,359
fruit tree and eat it God forbid or peel

838
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,280
a nav Orange in front of someone you're

839
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,920
going to be ostracized for that you're

840
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,960
going to be totally ripped apart for

841
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,160
that God forbid hypocrisy is off the

842
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,800
charts man it is think about that look

843
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,200
you guys check this out okay our brain

844
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,839
runs on Sugar by the way if you eat

845
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,200
brain which maybe some of you have tried

846
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,520
Brain before because it's you could if

847
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,920
you eat brain you'll notice it's sweet

848
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:31,400
creamy sweet and a little

849
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,800
salty interesting a little salty too

850
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,800
it's hardened glycogen that is a

851
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,880
carbohydrate your brain is a hardened

852
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,760
carbohydrate kind of like a sweet potato

853
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,839
with some with some mineral salts in

854
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,960
there it's hardened carbohydrates still

855
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,359
kind of soft and to some degree but

856
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,400
hardened and it takes like a it tastes

857
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,040
like banana and a celery stick together

858
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,520
the brain tastes like a banana and

859
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,040
celery stick together like why would I

860
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,160
know that I've talked to people who have

861
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,319
eaten brain okay and I've talked to a

862
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,079
lot of people over the years that have

863
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,119
eaten brain and they're like well I kind

864
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
of like it it's a delicacy because I've

865
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,280
talked to people all over the world for

866
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,520
years and years and years thousands upon

867
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,119
thousands over the years and I would say

868
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,520
well and they would ask me well how can

869
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,319
I simulate this brain flavor since it's

870
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,839
not a good idea that I'm eating

871
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:26,560
brains of different animals and I'd say

872
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,560
well put celery sticks and you know make

873
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,200
a banana salad celeries celery sticks

874
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,079
and bananas together kind of mix it

875
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,760
together and see what you think and the

876
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,839
consensus was always it's so close to

877
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,359
brain so close to The Taste there's a

878
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,040
reason because a banana has tiny amounts

879
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:47,960
of

880
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:51,000
Omega-3 right and lots of sugar okay and

881
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,040
then the celery has got those mineral

882
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,520
salts and that is the

883
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,280
combination your brain is made out of

884
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,839
mostly sugar that's glycogen stored

885
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:05,079
glycogen tiny amounts of Omega-3 and

886
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,400
lots of mineral salts okay and those

887
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:09,680
mineral salts help feed your

888
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,079
neurotransmitters some varieties of of

889
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,079
Omega-3 that our body even produces

890
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,640
itself from a healthy liver will be in

891
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,640
your brain but that's only a tiny bit

892
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,400
compared to the glycogen level I'm

893
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,000
talking about the stored

894
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,119
carbohydrate our brains heat up when we

895
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,800
think are you thinking now like are you

896
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,839
thinking like hey should I eat a piece

897
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,240
of fruit like should I think about it is

898
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,920
what should I do well electricity is

899
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,400
spinning around right now electrical

900
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,520
impulses are going around in your brain

901
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,000
right now and our brain needs a vast

902
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,200
amount of sugar which is glucose in

903
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,839
order to keep it cool you get a breakup

904
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,720
in a relationship your boyfriend you

905
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,839
know cheats or your girlfriend doesn't

906
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,359
want to be with you anymore or something

907
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,920
happens you go into a shock your brain

908
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,560
goes in the shock and or you you have a

909
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,000
you have a relationship issue of any

910
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,800
kind or any kind of trauma that's what

911
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,720
happens and you need those electrical

912
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,720
impulses to be working electricity off

913
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,599
sudden fires up and goes crazy when that

914
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,119
happens and our our brain needs a vast

915
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,280
amount of sugar which is glucose in

916
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:22,160
order to keep it cool kind of like

917
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,079
antifreeze to a car engine antifreeze is

918
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,760
Sy synthetically sweet it cools the

919
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,400
engine down

920
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,119
don't ever drink it God forbid but the

921
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:38,040
sugar cools heat see how it works sugar

922
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:42,640
cools heat not fat fat creates more heat

923
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:47,560
sugar cools heat fat creates more heat

924
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:50,560
so if your brain was all about fat it

925
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,960
lives all fat whatever you know it's all

926
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,760
made out of fat however it goes it's

927
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,560
going to overheat overheat and and what

928
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,200
happens is this is why instinctively

929
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,079
when you have a stressful event I was

930
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,760
mentioning before like a breakup or any

931
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,240
kind of trauma you crave something sweet

932
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,920
afterwards like ice cream that's one

933
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,839
thing right there after a breakup

934
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,280
relationship breakup that's a big one

935
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:18,079
all in its own I've heard it a thousand

936
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:22,520
times I need my ice cream like every day

937
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,760
you know the reason is glucose sugar

938
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,720
stops your brain from

939
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:31,319
overheating and burning up and getting

940
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,440
damaged and even mild tiny Strokes that

941
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:36,839
are undetectable from being that upset

942
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,880
after your brain goes into a electrical

943
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,400
storm of trauma when you see that

944
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,400
breakup message on your phone you're

945
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,160
like oh my God what is this I can't

946
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,440
believe this right or you get that news

947
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,359
like you're getting a divorce boom those

948
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,960
neurotransmitters they're like firing up

949
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,200
they're like burning up they're like

left and right and you don't have enough

953
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,359
glucose your blood sugar isn't

954
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,640
stabilized for that you don't have that

955
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,680
storage been in the brain I mean you

956
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,760

the sugar aspect is what allows you to

1009
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,720
function out of all those Foods I just

1010
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,359
mentioned you crave or that you want to

1011
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:39,000
eat but God forbid you touch a piece of

1012
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,960
fruit I mean for real and then you top

1013
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,359
it off all that food you top it off with

1014
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,000
what you believe might be a sweet that's

1015
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:49,000
kind of on the edge and a little off the

1016
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,800
chart like some ice cream or chocolate

1017
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,599
in your diet okay so do you drink coffee

1018
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,880
you put your oat milk or dairy or soy

1019
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,079
cream steamer or nutmilk in your coffee

1020
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,119
that's all sugar but you won't eat a

1021
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:06,920
piece of fruit in the morning cuz you're

1022
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:10,200
scared all these milks have sugar in

1023
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,520
them so think about this next time you

1024
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:16,280
hear someone say you don't crave sugar

1025
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,240

1026
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,200
you tell somebody out there I don't

1027
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,640

1028
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,520
little bit and next time you hear

1029
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,240
somebody tell you that like I don't

1030
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,599
crave sugar like the if they're out

1031
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,400

1032
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,800

1033
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,640
believe that you've been stupified

1034
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,520
tricked by not smart

1035
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,400
information and then you know it's

1036
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,520
everybody's smart I mean it's not about

1037
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,960
that it's about the information being

1038
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,079
not smart that's you have to see it

1039
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,160
because that's what it is and people get

1040
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:49,079
stupified all along I mean all around

1041
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,520
it's like all you hear out there I don't

1042
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,000
crave sweets I don't crave sweets oh man

1043
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,599
meanwhile everything they're eating is

1044
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,680
packed with sugar and it could be a slow

1045
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,920
burn like oats sure Slow Burn

1046
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,960
carbohydrate still sugar that's what

1047
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,319
you're living off of or a faster burn

1048
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,800
it's still sugar it's all the same in

1049
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:17,079
many ways actually in every way when it

1050
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:20,880
enters your cells and fat doesn't enter

1051
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:24,319
your cells from your blood and become

1052
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,079
energy that's a farce do they call it

1053
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,079
blood fat are they measuring that every

1054
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,200
time you go into the the doctor's office

1055
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,800
well we better check your blood fat we

1056
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,240
better make sure no because that's not

1057
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,000
what keeps you alive they're not

1058
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:41,400
measuring your blood fat it's your blood

1059
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,119
sugar they're measuring we need sugar to

1060
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:50,680
survive it's what our cells run on sugar

1061
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:55,359
has to attach itself to insulin to get

1062
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:58,480
into our cells to Keep Us Alive the fat

1063
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,720
doesn't attach itself to insulin and go

1064
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,680
into our cells where the heck does it go

1065
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,720
then that's what I'm trying to say the

1066
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,839
fat actually doesn't enter your cells

1067
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,800
interesting it's not its job it's not

1068
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,440
attaching to insulin so they're not like

1069
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,240
you go to doctor's office let me check

1070
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,760
your uh blood fat oh where is it at hm

1071
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,400
too fat too too high too low um what's

1072
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,880
going on nothing it's not even on

1073
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,280
anybody's radar but fat gets in the way

1074
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,440
of sugar entering your cell so it gets

1075
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,200
in the way it's a menace I'm not saying

1076
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,240
you can't eat any healthy fats it's not

1077
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,800
it at all I'm just saying are you ever

1078
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,800
going to eat a piece of fruit or are you

1079
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,640
just going to stay scared scared scared

1080
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,559
stay sick sick sick misinformation

1081
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:47,440
disinformation never touch a piece of

1082
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:50,119
fruit and just get you know exactly so

1083
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,680
insulin resistance occurs from the fat

1084
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:57,480
and the sugar combined right but fruit

1085
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,960
does not cause insulin

1086
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,880
resistance you have been taught that

1087
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,920
your oatmeal is a slow burn okay you

1088
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,160

burn it's it's you know it makes it it

1090
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,240
last it sustains you and you've

1091
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,799
experienced that yourself it's like and

1092
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,799
oh oats are okay I'm not anti oats but

1093
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:19,040
you've experienced it yourself it

1094
00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:21,520
sustains you for many hours when maybe

1095
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,520
you tried one or two pieces of fruit on

1096
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,079
its own and you got hungry fast and felt

1097
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,119
like it wasn't getting you through the

1098
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,240
day or getting you through the morning

1099
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:33,559
because you didn't eat enough fruit

1100
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,880
because it's not that high in calorie in

1101
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:39,119
fact it's not even high in calories and

1102
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,520
that's one of the mistakes there's not

1103
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,680
even a lot of sugar in fruit that's the

1104
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,880
irony and you know and what you're not

1105
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:50,799
realizing is that when you eat your

1106
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:53,720
oatmeal you probably added fat to it

1107
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:55,280
which also increases your calories you

1108
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,160
threw the nut Butters in there you threw

1109
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,680
the avocado I see people throw avocado

1110
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,480
in their in their oatmeal you stick milk

1111
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:07,040
in there nut milks nuts nut Butters

1112
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,079
coconut cacao almonds soy you add that

1113
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,760
to your oatmeal so now you have this

1114
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:15,799
really high dense dense caloric meal

1115
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,520
with a ton of fat on top of it mixed

1116
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:21,079
with sugar and you think you found the

1117
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,480
perfect meal when you're you know hey if

1118
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:24,079
you're not really sick or you don't have

1119
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,839
a lot of symptoms you got nothing going

1120
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,720
on yeah it feels like a perfect meal but

1121
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:30,960
now you have a problem you don't know

1122
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:36,240
about though that's going to bite you

1123
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:39,319
over time and it's insulin resistance

1124
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,200
that sits there and goes long sustaining

1125
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:43,880
so you have this long sustaining insulin

1126
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,960
resistance that catches up to you over

1127
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,880
time and eventually you have to then

1128
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,359
learn how to intermittent fast so now

1129
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,839
you're 25 years old and is like well I'm

1130
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:56,720
intermittent fasting now I have to not

1131
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:59,880
eat at all all morning all afternoon and

1132
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,920
try to exercise and stimulate on coffee

1133
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,079
drinks I got to I I have to intermittent

1134
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,200
fast now because you're putting the

1135
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,760
weight on you're seeing like a pound

1136
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,240
come on you're like oh my God that's my

1137
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,880
first pound that's my first pound I've

1138
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,799
ever seen why am I getting a couple of

1139
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,920
pounds on me I exercise um I'm eating

1140
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:18,839
healthy meals I'm doing my peanut butter

1141
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,359
butter smoothie bowls and oatmeal with

1142
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:23,160
nut Butters and I'm doing all that

1143
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,040
having avocado toast in the morning

1144
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:27,760
maybe I should intermittent fast and and

1145
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,720
and that's what people do so now they're

1146
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,359
doing that and maybe you get a little

1147
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,240
bit of low energy or a little bit of

1148
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:36,720
brain fog and if you're putting on a

1149
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,799
little weight and you're like okay

1150
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,880
intermittent fasting time and guess what

1151
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:44,079
all these things going wrong putting on

1152
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,920
a little bit of weight a couple extra

1153
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,160
pounds getting a little brain fog little

1154
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,160
acne starts kicking in or anything like

1155
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,559
that low energy it's not because of the

1156
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,839
fruit it's not because of a few few

1157
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:00,079
berries you might have thrown on one of

1158
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,799
your oatmeal

1159
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,760
bowls or you know or maybe a piece of

1160
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:07,839
banana or a half a banana you threw on

1161
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,040
an oatmeal Bowl it's not going to be

1162
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:14,440
that the underlying insulin resistance

1163
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,760
and stagnant sluggish liver caught up to

1164
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,319
you so you stop your oatmeal Bowls in

1165
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,119
the morning you stop your avocado toast

1166
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,359
in the morning you stop your eggs in the

1167
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,480
morning yeah you stop your eggs in in

1168
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:31,359
the morning and then everybody has to

1169
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,559
eventually intermittent fast and the

1170
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:38,000
only reason it seems to help is because

1171
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:41,680
you gave your body a break from eating

1172
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,319
fats for most of the day you went fat

1173
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:49,319
free by default without realizing it by

1174
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:52,400
accident without anybody knowing or

1175
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:54,799
realizing it it has nothing to do with

1176
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,240
fruit and that's just one thing that has

1177
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:58,960
nothing to to do with fruit everything

1178
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,680
has nothing to do with fruit that goes

1179
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,440
wrong and eventually your intermittent

1180
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,599
fasting doesn't seem to work anymore

1181
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,400
either later on because you get these

1182
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,280
cravings and you still have insulin

1183
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,480
resistance because you're still eating

1184
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,200
fats at the end of the day and you never

1185
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,799
know how to escape it and you don't know

1186
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:26,280
you even have it the insulin resistance

1187
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:29,680
and still you stay away from fruit

1188
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:33,040
unbelievable but you still cheat on

1189
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,839
pizza ice cream whether it's plant-based

1190
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:38,359
or animal-based so you swing from

1191
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,880
craving to craving and then holistic

1192
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:42,280
doctor to doctor and guess what you get

1193
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,680
told there when you go to your holistic

1194
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:48,880
doctor you know God bless them but you

1195
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:51,240
get told get off of fruit just don't as

1196
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,280
if you eat fruit all day like you get

1197
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,160
told to get off of fruit happens every

1198
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
day people aren't even eating fruit but

1199
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,559
they remember eating a piece of Apple

1200
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,200
like or they remember eating half an

1201
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,880
Apple 4 days ago and they're at the

1202
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,640
doctor's office and their holistic

1203
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,319
doctor's like stay off of fruit that's

1204
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,319
number one that's your problem here oh

1205
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:11,119
whoa as if you're eating fruit all day

1206
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:13,880
long but what's crazy is everyone who

1207
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,319
gets sick for the first time never

1208
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,720
really ate

1209
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:21,799
fruit how much fruit did you guys eat

1210
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,280
before you first got sick and if you did

1211
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:25,760
eat a lot of fruit you're a rarity I'm

1212
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,960
talking like a RAR

1213
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,240
think about it when someone first gets

1214
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,480
sick and they start to clean up their

1215
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,799
diet and try fruit more they instantly

1216
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,760
get told to stop either through

1217
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,640
something they see either through you

1218
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,119
know a podcast they heard you know from

1219
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,480
a professional being on a podcast

1220
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,760
telling you stay away from fruit do low

1221
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,440
glycemic or don't do none at all

1222
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,760
claiming it's going to make you sicker

1223
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:57,480
when the person already got sick before

1224
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,400
eating the fruit and now the person is

1225
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,319
afraid of fruit because of anti-f fruit

1226
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,079
propaganda and misinformation without

1227
00:55:03,319 --> 00:55:10,799
anybody realizing it the very thing they

1228
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:13,000
never ate the fruit was medicine so

1229
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:15,640
without realizing it you guys the very

1230
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,799
thing no one ever even ate was their

1231
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,240
medicinals was their

1232
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:22,799
medicine they just didn't know how to

1233
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:27,599
use it as a healing

1234
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:30,480
tool you must learn how to use it

1235
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,160
properly so when you try the medicine a

1236
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,640
piece of fruit it scares them because

1237
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,880
you don't know how to use it and that's

1238
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,319
what happens you know it's like a lot of

1239
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,799
things it's like anything if you don't

1240
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:41,640
know how to do something or you don't

1241
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:45,000
know how to use something and understand

1242
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:48,000
its power or what it holds or what it

1243
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
does it scares you you don't use it

1244
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,559
right no one teaches you and right now

1245
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,520
in this world no one wants to teach you

1246
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,520
how to use a piece of fruit no way they

1247
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,079
want the opposite they want to scare you

1248
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:02,280
scare you out of it and that's the whole

1249
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:04,319
thing they are they they are told the

1250
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,480
fructose is bad for them that's what

1251
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,000
everybody gets told by Health experts

1252
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,200
it's like fructose it's a scary word Now

1253
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,839
by Health experts who don't know why

1254
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:17,760
they're sick to begin with meanwhile the

1255
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:20,079

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,079
in your small intestinal tract it's

1269
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,280
helping to dis olve rancid fats and

1270
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:02,000
rotting proteins in the lining of the

1271
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,160
intestinal tract and colon and

1272
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:09,079
dadum it's helping to detox your liver

1273
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:11,799
of all the poisons and helping to starve

1274
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:15,240
viruses and then if you're still dumping

1275
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:17,839
in eggs dairy too many nut Butters lots

1276
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:20,599
of chicken right down the pike and then

1277
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,280
throwing fruit on top of it that fruit

1278
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,920
you're dropping down is going to be like

1279
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,359
oh my God this is a serious mess right

1280
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,920
right here and there's going to be a

1281
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:32,280
large conflict going on in here a larger

1282
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,680
conflict of interest because the fruit

1283
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:38,680
is going to have to try to clean up a

1284
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:42,559
mess on top of a new mess it wants to

1285
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:45,280
digest fast and push out all the bad and

1286
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,160
then it gets misconstrued as fruit being

1287
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,960
the problem instead of your dirty system

1288
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,520
that's a mess so the messenger gets shot

1289
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:56,480
you got a mess inside of you there's a

1290
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,760
whole bunch of dirty going on inside

1291
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,599
there like a whole bunch of sludge all

1292
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,039
kinds of bugs all kinds of troublemakers

1293
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,359
and you drop fruit in there to clean

1294
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:10,160
that mess and the messenger gets shot

1295
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,119
it's fruit and it's that you know it's

1296
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,160
the Apple the banana the mango the

1297
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:17,119
orange the peach one time a year and the

1298
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,559
melon that didn't do any harm and it

1299
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:22,839
didn't do any wrong it's only there to

1300
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:24,319
help you and you shoot it in the back

1301
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:27,039
you shoot the messenger in the back you

1302
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:29,599
don't even give it a blindfold or its

1303
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:32,200
last cigarette meanwhile these fruit

1304
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,640
haters and fruit demonizes don't know

1305
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:38,880
how to even eat fruit and I know because

1306
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:41,039
I actually talked to one many years ago

1307
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,079
that was also onto the bandwagon of

1308
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,839
trying to destroy fruit create the war

1309
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,839
on fruit and I said do you even know how

1310
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:51,000
to use fruit or eat fruit and they just

1311
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,480
knew that you cut a grapefruit in half

1312
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,760
and you try to cut the little squares

1313
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,640
out the triangles out that was the most

1314
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,920
they knew and from what I heard talking

1315
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,760
to this one person this professional

1316
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,799
they were putting sugar on top of their

1317
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,079
great fruit on top of it and fruit they

1318
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:09,920
didn't even know how to eat it or didn't

1319
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,160
even know what kind of fruits were out

1320
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:17,359
there but fruits evil totally evil it's

1321
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:21,880
unbelievable so look and there's

1322
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:24,240
therapeutic nature to these fruits and

1323
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,640
that's the power that's within him so

1324
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,720
that he healing happens all around

1325
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,520
inside our bodies fruit can be used

1326
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:37,599
therapeutically you know and when you

1327
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:41,000
align other therapeutic foods with fruit

1328
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,680
extra healing occurs so then there's a

1329
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,359
crowd that's sick for the first time you

1330
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,760
guys hear this all the time maybe out

1331
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,160
there you get the crowd that's sick for

1332
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,880
the first time maybe they got a little

1333
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:54,119
bloating maybe a little weight gain

1334
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,520
maybe some acne a little eczema and they

1335
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:59,079
never really eat fruit and don't start

1336
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:01,160
eating it either sure they get rid of

1337
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:04,039
their processed foods you know they're

1338
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,520
eating healthier fats which is which is

1339
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:09,039
good they're eating vegetables they may

1340
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,440
see an improvement in their symptoms

1341
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:15,119
maybe they throw in a few berries some

1342
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,799
assai told to stay off sugar but still

1343
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,319
eat sugar bad sugar and Grains

1344
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:23,760
especially on their cheat days or

1345
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:26,880
self-care days but they don't eat fruit

1346
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,880
or ever enough fruit and they hate on

1347
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,839
fruit and spread that hatred around like

1348
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,480
they just hate it they they'll just

1349
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,880
comment about it they'll talk about it

1350
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,240
they'll post about it they hate fruit

1351
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,920
even if it's done in a nice way like

1352
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,039
even if they it's done in a really nice

1353
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,079
thoughtful way like what seems to be

1354
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:46,880
kind of like a kind manner of what their

1355
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,880
experience is like someone will say

1356
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,960
everybody's different I'm different you

1357
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,200
know you it might work for you but it

1358
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,880
didn't work for me I tried fruit because

1359
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,960
of what what they learned from the

1360
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,440
health podcast out there the Talking

1361
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,000
Heads of health or that piece of fruit

1362
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,240
bothered my stomach and didn't make me

1363
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,520
feel right or something meanwhile that

1364
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,240
piece of fruit just dropped into a dirty

1365
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,559
environment and it's trying to clean up

1366
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,440
the mess and no one understands cuz when

1367
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,920
like I said they listen to maybe a

1368
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,839
health podcast or something like that

1369
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,640
that fruit is bad they instantly just

1370
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,520
all of a sudden go with it they get

1371
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,520
suckered into it and they listen to the

1372
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,160
talking heads out there that just want

1373
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,480
to climb the ego ladder in health rip

1374
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,559
rip down fruit on social media Health

1375
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,960
experts spreading the same tricks and

1376
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:37,559
game that was originally planted by the

1377
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:40,480
industries to start the war on fruit and

1378
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:42,920
we get suckered into it and we lose

1379
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,000
something that was really going to help

1380
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,640
us but we didn't understand it we just

1381
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,720
didn't understand it and it was actually

1382
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,079
going to be a Saving Grace for the

1383
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,079
future if you get sicker down the road

1384
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,799
you know you'll hear things like like

1385
01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:00,279
some low glycemic fruit is okay but

1386
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:02,039
overall fruit is bad you know it's too

1387
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:05,279
sweet and then there's the people who

1388
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:07,720
never even ate fruit got sick tried a

1389
01:02:05,279 --> 01:02:09,240
piece of fruit and they're still sick

1390
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:12,520
because they don't know the cause of

1391
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:14,799
their symptoms and how they got sick and

1392
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:18,799
why they're still sick they blame it on

1393
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:21,119
fruit though okay and maybe saying it

1394
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:23,680
made me sick when I tried it it gave me

1395
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,880
that tummy ache fruit always gets the

1396
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,920
blame aren't you glad you're not a piece

1397
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:31,680
of fruit shunned alienated

1413
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,359
mysterious which we'll cover you know in

1414
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:20,160
upcoming episodes these are all nervous

1415
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:22,880
symptom conditions nervous system

1416
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,640
conditions and symptoms and people with

1417
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,960
these symptoms didn't get sick because

1418
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:32,640
of eating fruit they didn't eat any

1419
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,200
fruit practically nobody does but what

1420
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,279
you need to know is an important part of

1421
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,880
recovery from these neurological

1422
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:42,520
symptoms that I just mentioned requires

1423
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:47,160
consistent

1424
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:51,240
uninterrupted levels of glucose sugar

1425
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:54,400
from a natural source sugar from

1426
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:57,920
fruit because your nervous system is

1427
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:01,520
made up of nerve cells you guys nerve

1428
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,559
cells exist on sugar whether anybody

1429
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,480
likes it or not I should say it again

1430
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:07,760
all those nervous system conditions your

1431
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,599
Vagas nerve causing all these different

1432
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,480
problems people don't even know about

1433
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,160
like medical medum information of what

1434
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:17,319
what causes what in your your Vegas

1435
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:19,599
nerve it needs sugar to exist that's

1436
01:04:17,319 --> 01:04:22,680
what the nerve cells are made up of they

1437
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,920
draw it in they need it

1438
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,960
desperately meanwhile fruit is a way for

1439
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,520
these people with neurological symptoms

1440
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:36,319
to recover and heal and it's kept from

1441
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:39,240
them on purpose by the industries and by

1442
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:41,799
accident by well-meaning practitioners

1443
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,559
and influencers who are you know who are

1444
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:46,760
well-meaning and doing cool things but

01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,599
Panacea like anti-aging is the answer

1467
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,079
like everybody's on the circuit don't

1468
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:47,960

1469
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:52,079
anti-aging and living longer and there's

1470
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:54,559
all these 20y olds and 30y olds laying

1471
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:57,880
in their bed on mattress Island

1472
01:05:54,559 --> 01:06:00,599
suffering you know if you claim to be an

1473
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:04,000
anti-aging expert and you're not pro-

1474
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:06,559
fruit all fruit not just berries then

1475
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,119
you're so far off the Mark it's

1476
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:11,839
embarrassing and the sad part is

1477
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:15,400
anti-aging experts don't even know why

1478
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,760
anybody is sick they don't know why the

1479
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,520
25-year-old like can't do anything

01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:23,760
function laying in bed fatigue headaches

1481
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,520
migraines floaters in the eyes and

1482
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,319
they're anti-aging experts and they're

1483
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,520
on the circuit like they have all the

1484
01:06:27,319 --> 01:06:32,599
answers you know that's bad enough to

1485
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:36,119
begin with as it is all of it aging

1486
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:40,200
means we're oxidizing oxidizing means

1487
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:42,520
our cells die the question is how fast

1488
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:45,400
are we oxidizing and what causes the

1489
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:48,119
oxidizing I'll give you a hint we have

1490
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,440
toxins pathogens in us more than every

1491
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:51,640
before in a history I've been talking

1492
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,799
about it for 35 years I call them

1493
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,760
troublemakers take for and think about

1494
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:57,960
this toxic stuff right here take for

1495
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,359
example air fresheners plug-in air

1496
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:03,279
fresheners colog perfumes conventional

1497
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:06,559
scented candles conventional cleaning

1498
01:07:03,279 --> 01:07:08,960
supplies gasoline petrochemicals

1499
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:11,359
pesticides herbicides fungicides

1500
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:15,319
pathogens like Epstein bar shingles

1501
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:18,200
herpes simplex strep cyeg virus hhvs of

1502
01:07:15,319 --> 01:07:21,079
all kinds and all their mutations and

1503
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,000
varieties and more and guess what you

1504
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:27,079
age fast with all of that and everybody

1505
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:31,039
is peppered with it all men and women

1506
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:33,119
are saturated with colog perfumes sended

1507
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,680
candles air fresheners and living with

1508
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,480
bugs pathogens inside of them and

1509
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,480
meanwhile they won't even touch a piece

1510
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:42,240
of fruit they get told don't touch a

1511
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:44,960
piece of fruit the very thing that's

1512
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:48,160
anti-aging one of the most powerful

1513
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:51,640
anti-aging tools and healing tools to

1514
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:55,119
get those aging troublemakers out of the

1515
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:58,680
body and prevent premature aging and the

1516
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:00,920
anti-aging clowns on the circuit they're

1517
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:04,200
all against fruit except maybe few

1518
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:08,920
berries or something or a green banana

1519
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:11,480
and or a green apple you know fruit has

1520
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,720
undiscovered antioxidants that are

1521
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,960
critical to our survival in today's

1522
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:20,199
world especially the stress all that

1523
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:23,560
stress and it's the largest array of

1524
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:27,159
antioxidants that is non-toxic in any

1525
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:29,520
way meaning you can get large amounts of

1526
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:32,239
undiscovered antioxid and a few

1527
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,960
discovered ones but large amounts of it

1528
01:08:32,239 --> 01:08:38,679
without having to deal with toxic things

1529
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:42,920
involved in other Foods or other places

1530
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:44,880
you can find an antioxidant in caffeine

1531
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:47,120
right in a caffeine beverage but it

1532
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,759
comes with a price so there'll be all

1533
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,279
the science of research to protect the

1534
01:08:48,759 --> 01:08:54,120
caffeine indust rate right and it'll be

1535
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,839
like let's find an antioxidant and in

1536
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,199
coffeee let's find it in some kind of

1537
01:08:56,839 --> 01:09:00,600
caffeinated beverage let's find it in

1538
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:02,520
MCH tea let's find it in black tea let's

1539
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,480
find it in chocolate so all the science

1540
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:06,359
will be paid for for that to try to find

1541
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,359
that one antioxidant that two

1542
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,719
antioxidants and then they Herald that

1543
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:13,600
antioxidant like God like that's going

1544
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,960
to be your savior but no matter how much

1545
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:20,239
caffeinated beverage or cacao you eat

1546
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,000
one blueberry or one bite of an apple

1547
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:25,319
will give you more

1548
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:29,080
antioxidants than pound of chocolate

1549
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:31,520
cacao can ever offer see sence doesn't

1550
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:34,040
look at antioxidants and fruit anymore

1551
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,679
they don't because it would spur on a

1552
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:39,880
massive upsurge of fruit intake and

1553
01:09:36,679 --> 01:09:43,000
fruit production and anti-aging experts

1554
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:45,440
they don't Echo the power of fruit and

1555
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:47,839
all the antioxidants they don't they

1556
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,719
just look for these obscure items and be

1557
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:51,000
like oh that's good for long lasting

1558
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:53,880
Health that's good so you can live

1559
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,400
forever oh that's good too and this is

1560
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,800
they they don't even they ignore fruit

1561
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:03,360
there was you know look there was some

1562
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:05,880
food science done on some fruits at one

1563
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,400
point like 20 years ago and it spawned

1564
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,600
on interest in Fruit being good and it

1565
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:15,360
was instantly crushed and discredited

1566
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,679
you can guess all the reasons why you

1567
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,840
know you can know you can guess right

1568
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,440
because Corruption of course corruption

1569
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,320
everywhere instead science

1570
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:28,880
scrambles as it's being paid off by the

1571
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:31,320
caffeine industry to search for one or

1572
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:35,000
two types of antioxidants in a coffee

1573
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:37,320
bean cacao matcha tea or caffeinated tea

1574
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,560
meanwhile caffeine blows out and

1575
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,880
destroys years worth of

1576
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:44,920
antioxidants so you know what I mean

1577
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:47,960
it's like okay let's have our caffeine

1578
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:51,080
beverage get those two antioxidants in a

1579
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:54,280
small dosage of it and then let's just

1580
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,280
blow out with all that caffeine

1581
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:58,600
killing off your adrenals and everything

1582
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,840
else because it it Spurs on corrosive

1583
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,239
adrenaline you get an adrenaline Spike

1584
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:06,280
from caffeine and that adrenaline ages

1585
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:09,239
you quickly it's

1586
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:12,600
corrosive it actually injures cells and

1587
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:14,280
nerves over time when it's every day

1588
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,679
every day and then your hair starts

1589
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,360

01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,480
because it's manipulated by man first of

1623
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,600
all they trick people out with that one

1624
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:46,360
by confusing them by saying fruit is

1625
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:49,159
hybridized most people think GMO is what

1626
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:53,440
it is then they hear hybridize so saying

1627
01:12:49,159 --> 01:12:56,000
oh GMO it's not GMO so hybridize does

1628
01:12:53,440 --> 01:13:00,000
doesn't mean GMO one thing fruit haters

1629
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,960
don't know is we have been hybridizing

1630
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,960
grafting and coveting fruit in different

1631
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:09,239
ways for thousands of years all around

1632
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,719
the globe this is how the human race

1633
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:13,400
adapts and

1634
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,600
survives fruit haters and fruit

1635
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,080
demonizes will tell us that we make the

1636
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,440
fruit too sweet now and fruits were not

1637
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:22,480
sweet a thousand years ago you know

1638
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,199
that's kind of funny because that's

1639
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,440
funny how does they know what fruit

1640
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:29,080
tasted like thousands of years ago think

1641
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,880
about that one for a minute you guys

1642
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:34,719
wild blueberries are way more sweeter

1643
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:38,960
than regular cultivated blueberries did

1644
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:42,320
you hear that wild blueberries wild are

1645
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,520
way more sweeter than any regular

1646
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:48,320
cultivated blueberry that instantly

1647
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,199
debunks it I guess we debunked it then

1648
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,760
okay there you go that's a wild food

1649
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:53,920
that's been around for thousands of

1650
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,360
years wild blueberries

1651
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,120
thousands of years growing here and it's

1652
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:01,679
sweeter than a cultivated blueberry

1653
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:04,520
instantly debunked it's the opposite

1654
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:08,159
fruits aren't sweet enough today fruit

1655
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:11,639
haters don't realize that fruit was

1656
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:14,120
sweeter in the past it's not even sweet

1657
01:14:11,639 --> 01:14:15,440
enough today that's that's why you know

1658
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,080
what that's a lot of reasons why people

1659
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,320
hate it right there it's not sweet

1660
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,400
enough they cut open to a mango and it's

1661
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,840
not sweet enough they're like uh what is

1662
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,080
is this they cut they cut open a papaya

1663
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,600
and it's not sweet enough and they're

1664
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:33,800
like gross what is this this the problem

1665
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:36,679
is bananas aren't even sweet you peel a

1666
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,360
banana and you eat it you can't even

1667
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:42,520
taste the sugar sometimes on any level

1668
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,520
in there and so people don't even like

1669
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,199
fruit because it's not even sweet enough

1670
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,560
if it was that sweet and tast it that

1671
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:52,800
that good and sweet people would be like

1672
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:55,159
I want that I want that all right the

1673
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,120
bottom one many of the people that I

1674
01:14:55,159 --> 01:15:00,679
know the reason why they hate fruit

1675
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,960
because it doesn't taste sweet that's

1676
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:05,040
why they actually hate it they'll taste

1677
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:07,239
some berries they're like tart there's

1678
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:09,239
really no sugar in them they'll taste

1679
01:15:07,239 --> 01:15:11,239
you know an apple it's just boring it's

1680
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,560
not really that sweet apple pie it's a

1681
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:13,719
different story I have a friend that

1682
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,600
would be like well I would love this

1683
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:19,560
apple and an apple pie with sugar table

1684
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,320
sugar added to it okay unless someone

1685
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,360
runs into the sweetest watermelon

1686
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:26,000
they've ever had like once in a blue

1687
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:27,840
moon in their life or the only other way

1688
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,600
they actually like fruit is when they

1689
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,280
stop eating all the other sugar in their

1690
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,360
diet all the other sugar that I

1691
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,679
mentioned like get rid of all that cane

1692
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,440
sugar all the nut milks all everything

1693
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,239
that has sugar in it that's sweet all

1694
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,600
the things all the pizza with the pizza

1695
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:42,000
crust and the cheese and the sauce and

1696
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,560
once they get rid of all that for a

1697
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,520
little while and they eat a piece of

1698
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:47,400
fruit they're like oh my God this is the

1699
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,199
best thing I've ever tasted in my life

1700
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:52,960
it's because they basically went without

1701
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:55,199
all the bad sugar and then finally had a

1702
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,920
PE piece of fruit which isn't even that

1703
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,320
sweet but thought it was the best thing

1704
01:15:56,920 --> 01:16:02,280
ever okay here's a talking point with

1705
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:05,239
fruit haters heirloom foods that have

1706
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:07,960
seeds is what counts and that counts

1707
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:10,520
only well first of all yeah that counts

1708
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:13,719
true you know and these fruit haters say

1709
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:18,080
fruit that isn't heirloom and doesn't

1710
01:16:13,719 --> 01:16:21,120
have seeds is bad for us this isn't

1711
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:25,159
accurate they say it with no evidence at

1712
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:28,360
all the truth is a Loom heirloom fruits

1713
01:16:25,159 --> 01:16:31,320
heirloom foods are just older varieties

1714
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:33,840
with seeds or No Seeds there are

1715
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:36,080
heirloom varieties of fruit with little

1716
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,120
to no seeds and there are heirloom

1717
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:42,239
varieties with lots of seeds nutrient

1718
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:45,080
density in phytochemical compounds don't

1719
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:48,719
discriminate on how many seeds are in a

1720
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:51,120
fruit so it's like that's another psych

1721
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,400
out they throw at you right there okay

1722
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,320
nutrient density phytochemical IAL

1723
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,880
compounds antioxidants minerals and

1724
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:02,040
trace minerals have nothing to do with

1725
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:05,360
if a fruit has a ton of seeds in it or

1726
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:11,040
very few seeds in it so there you go

1727
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:14,120
bottom line people harp on non GMO fruit

1728
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,440
and the funny thing is get this point

1729
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:19,280
right here the people that are harping

1730
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:21,840
on non GMO fruit meaning fruit that's

1731
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,840
not GMO on any level okay whether it's

1732
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:27,800
hybridized or air Loom or just

1733
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:30,400
cultivated or graft it just natural

1734
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,199
things we've done for hundreds of years

1735
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,480
all right to sustain ourselves here on

1736
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:36,719
planet Earth when people harp on all

1737
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:38,560
that you know what the funny thing is

1738
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:43,760
these fruit demonizes are most likely

1739
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:46,679
consuming GMO soy GMO corn GMO beets the

1740
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,960
anti-aging experts on the circuit with

1741
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:52,280
podcast they're eating GMO corn GMO

1742
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,520
beets animal products raised on GMO

1743
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,440
grains in restaurants as they're

1744
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:59,520
traveling periodically in their diet

1745
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,679
unpurified water in restaurants and

1746
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:06,040
coffee shops GMO canola oil natural

1747
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:08,560
flavors with MSG nutritional yeast which

1748
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:10,960
is natural occurring MSG caffeinated

1749
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,120
beverages with GMO soy in it

1750
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:17,320
occasionally gluten in some way while

1751
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:19,480
ripping down fruit all day long it's

1752
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:21,600
sitting there and ripping apart fruit

1753
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:24,000
and ripping down fruit and they're

1754
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,400
sitting there too on their po podcast on

1755
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,560
their platforms talking about how bad

1756
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,400
fruit is and they're getting GMO stuff

1757
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:35,000
in their diet left in right is what

1758
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:38,440
they're doing another difficult part of

1759
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,000
fruit fear and fruit hatred is is the

1760
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:43,440
very early disinformation that's

1761
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,040
misinformation purposely put out there

1762
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:48,760
that was strategically placed in the

1763
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:51,360
health Movement by these paid for moles

1764
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,320
and plants that spark the lies about

1765
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:55,600
fruit having something to do with poor

1766
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,280
health or causing sickness and not

1767
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,199
helping in any way in someone's healing

1768
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,719
or recovery these moles and plants these

1769
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:06,679
fruit demonizer I'm talking about that

1770
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:08,880
did that are still out there now yeah

1771
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:10,239
yeah they're still out there now you

1772
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,600
better believe

1773
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:15,199
it they're spouting out and here's the

1774
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:19,120
funny thing too they're still out there

1775
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:23,159
now spouting out encrypted biological

1776
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:28,840

the person who is sick and has already

1782
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:47,400
been to plenty of doctors believe that

1783
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,600
there is this rainbow of Glorious

1784
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,400
alternative medicine research and

1785
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,280
science that the person with symptoms

1786
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,280
and is sick just doesn't doesn't

1787
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,239
understand or has to tap into it or

1788
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,560
haven't tapped into it yet like like the

1789
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:02,840
information's out there the message is

1790
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,600
out there these guys are echoing it

1791
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,000
these anti-aging experts with encrypted

1792
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,880
terminology

1793
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,600
telr okay it's interesting when a

1794
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,520
person's laying in bed and they've been

1795
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,920
to their 10th specialist 10th

1796
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,120
neurologist and they're they're 28 years

1797
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,600
old 35 years old they can't even get

1798
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,840
into a car they've got crippling anxiety

1799
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:25,400
suffering with fatigue and everything

1800
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,320
everything I don't think teles is going

1801
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,159
to help I don't think DNA is going to

1802
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,719
help them and I don't think talk of

1803
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:34,639
these things really helps and that's the

1804
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:37,360
irony to it all but these plants and

1805
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:39,520
moles these these beginners of the fruit

1806
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,600
war on fruit movement from the start

1807
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,560
going back years ago that are still

1808
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:47,040
around make it seem like there's these

1809
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:49,639
mysterious options to get everybody

1810
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:52,159
better and meanwhile everybody's getting

1811
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:55,080
sicker like ever before you know and it

1812
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:57,719
makes that sick person feel like they

1813
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:00,000
just need to find a genius or someone

1814
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:02,440
who understands anti-aging or someone

1815
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,360
who understands the gut in some way and

1816
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,760
everything else that these moles and

1817
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:09,520
plants put out there by the industries

1818
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:12,400
are spouting out in hopes to be healed

1819
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:14,080
or if a person who is not so sick and

1820
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,239
they haven't suffered or been to five

1821
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,760
doctors they will think these anti-

1822
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,360
fruit moles and plants are on to

1823
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,639
something so if you're not so sick and

1824
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,719
you're not really suffering that much

1825
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:24,560

while you got a little energy loss and

1829
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,400
you watch one of these Geniuses that are

1830
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,120
on podcasts and other platforms and

1831
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:35,719
other places that tear down fruit in

1832
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:39,080
some way and you hear them talk about

1833
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:41,320

these Geniuses and whoa and they got

1836
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:49,880
answers and they must be working with

1837
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:52,440
today's science it's a great

1838
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:54,480
distraction you know while laying around

1839
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,199
with a few symptoms listening to

1840
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,280
podcasts and watching YouTubes and

1841
01:21:56,199 --> 01:22:00,320
hearing about telr and then getting out

1842
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:02,840
of bed walking to your kitchen wondering

1843
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,560

1846
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:11,760
fruit today and they kick fruit down as

1847
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,960

01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:18,159
encrypted genetic anti-aging

1849
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:21,280
inflammation talk and gut health

1850
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:23,480
rhetoric doesn't get someone's tenius

1851
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:26,159

there and be like whoa Geniuses that got

1871
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,320
all the answers on the podcast or on the

1872
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:12,639
YouTube they're so smart they must be

1873
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,920
tied into science and all the key parts

1874
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,199
of healing it's not going to get your

1875
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,880

all you

1877
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,960
want but it does lead you to think there

1878
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:26,480
is this pain fantasy of information that

1879
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:29,840
these guys know and you just need to

1880
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:32,960
learn it that anti fruit rhetoric makes

1881
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:35,920
sense fruit is bad and it will not help

1882
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:38,320

1883
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,800
this way is an anti-f fruit Moler plant

1884
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:42,639
or a bad person they just follow all the

1885
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:46,440
lead and they'll just they'll also speak

1886
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:48,360
this you know leaky gut tmrs DNA

1887
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:50,120
anti-aging whatever it is it doesn't

1888
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,040
mean everybody's bad that's not it I'm

1889
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,639
just saying they're The Originals that

1890
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:57,280
are still out there now setting

1891
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:00,400
everybody up and they're fed the

1892
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:03,159
information to set them up and still

1893
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:06,560
bring down fruit at the same time that's

1894
01:24:03,159 --> 01:24:07,920
what that is and they you know but the

1895
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,360
but there's people out there that just

1896
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,280
take their lead that fruit is bad

1897
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:13,840
because they don't like fruit anyway cuz

1898
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,239
exactly it's not even

1899
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,800
sweet so it's an easy

1900
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:21,840
knockdown you know anti- fruit

1901
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:25,360
propagandists don't want anyone to know

1902
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:27,960
someone has healed while having fruit in

1903
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:31,360
their diet check that out I'm just

1904
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:34,480
saying it like it is they don't want

1905
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,320
anybody knowing someone healed by having

1906
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:38,840
fruit in their diet they ignore the

1907
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:41,840
healing Stories the healing recoveries

1908
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:44,679
that fruit played a role in spirit of

1909
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:47,199
compassion has always told me you can

1910
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:49,280
heal with meat in your diet did you hear

1911
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:50,719
that one Spirit of compassion always

1912
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,760
told me you can still heal with meat in

1913
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:57,320
your diet depending on your condition

1914
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,840
meat but Spirit of compassion has also

1915
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:02,639
always told me that you can heal with

1916
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,199
fruit in your diet too and it's critical

1917
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,560
to have it in everyone's diet but the

1918
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:11,560
fruit haters and the fruit fear creators

1919
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,840
put a blind eye to this very truth the

1920
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,880
truth that so many people have healed

1921
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,960
already using fruit critical recoveries

1922
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,080
life-saving recoveries I'm not biased

1923
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,840
towards meat everybody knows that about

1924
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,400
me

1925
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,840
it's in medical medium books starting

1926
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:30,480
with medical medium book one but they

1927
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:32,960
are biased towards fruit interesting the

1928
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:35,960
this this disinformation they put out

1929
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:39,360
there purposely about fruit has worked

1930
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,000
its way into the plant-based movement so

1931
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,280
that people trying to heal in that

1932
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,280
movement don't have a shot in hell if

1933
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:48,080
they're really sick so people who go

1934
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:50,480
plant-based they don't have a shot in

1935
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,480
hell if they're really sick or keep on

1936
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:55,040
getting sicker that that's what happens

1937
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,040
and just being gluten-free isn't enough

1938
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,520
and Animal product free isn't enough for

1939
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:02,560
a lot of people who go plant-based and

1940
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,600
they become afraid of fruit scared to

1941
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:08,000
death of fruit so they live off of fats

1942
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,560
and then they try to go keto plant-based

1943
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,119
and then their symptoms worsen and then

1944
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,679
another one bites the dust and a plant-

1945
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:17,639
baser then runs for the hills to eat

1946
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:20,440
salmon and eggs to start with and

1947
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,239
becomes an animal baser again and starts

1948
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,800
eating animal protein and leaves the

1949
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:27,199
plant-based movement and if they ate one

1950
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,840
piece of fruit their symptoms will be

1951
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:34,960
blamed on that seen that 100 times out

1952
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,800
there fruit has become a scapegoat it's

1953
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,760
so you don't have to look at the real

1954
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,199
problems and issues that are causing

1955
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:45,199
symptoms it protects the industries it's

1956
01:26:42,199 --> 01:26:48,920
above everybody the sabotage the war on

1957
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:52,840
fruit is above everybody which really is

1958
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:55,440
the war on people staying healthy what's

1959
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:58,600
funny is the industries that want to

1960
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,679
keep a sick choose professionals who

1961
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,239
haven't suffered from chronic illness

1962
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:07,040
yet in their life to spread the fruit

1963
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:09,600
fear these professionals are easy to

1964
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:13,119
convince because they don't know what

1965
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,360
it's like to suffer and not get answers

1966
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:17,760
at least yet in their life even though

1967
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:20,360
it comes to them too where they get sick

1968
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:23,840
and they look for answers eventually so

1969
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:26,199
they don't know what it's like to be so

1970
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,080
sick and to have tried

1971
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:31,119
everything and they're at that tipping

1972
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,840
scale on the edge with their symptoms

1973
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:34,880
and illness where they know the

1974
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,960
difference where fruit is really keeping

1975
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,840
them alive they've never experienced

1976
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,560
that where it's keeping them from

1977
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:45,360
falling more ill having beautiful fruit

1978
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:48,159
and how important it is to find fruit as

1979
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,320
well they don't know about

1980
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:54,800
this and they don't know how to use

1981
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:56,920
fruit as has this healing tool I'm not

1982
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:00,360
talking about only eating fruit and

1983
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:02,760
fruit only and nothing else at all

1984
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:07,159
nothing I'm talking about using it

1985
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:09,679
specifically in ways as a healing tool I

1986
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:11,840
have seen so many people with colitis

1987
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:14,679
and Crohns there are millions of them in

1988
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,159
the world that if they knew how to use

1989
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:20,000
fruit it could have saved them from

1990
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:23,119
years of Agony same with people with

1991
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,880
gastroparesis Celiac IBS gastric spasms

1992
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:29,040
and so many more because yes the ones

1993
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,840
that learn how to use fruit realize fast

1994
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:33,280
how much it

1995
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:35,320
matters and these anti- fruit

1996
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:37,440
professionals that haven't suffered you

1997
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:39,520
guys that take their queue from

1998
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:42,080
disinformation spread by moles and

1999
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,719
plants believe they have it all figured

2000
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:47,280
out and they think they're smarter and

2001
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:49,480
Superior in health because they haven't

2002
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,480
fallen ill yet but they also take that

2003
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:53,360
little humble nature to they play that

2004
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:56,280
games there's a little humbleness going

2005
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:57,560
on so you're thinking huh you know and

2006
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,679
then you end up thinking maybe they're

2007
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,800
just eating all the right things when

2008
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,000
they are just lucky they can still eat

2009
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,880
pizza drink wine on the

2010
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,040
weekends and here's the thing they teach

2011
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,239
younger people who haven't been sick or

2012
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,960
suffered yet in the health movement who

2013
01:29:11,239 --> 01:29:14,520
also can still eat pretty much what they

2014
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,159
want you know who you know some people

2015
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,880
right you know probably who they are you

2016
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:20,000
probably see people and they're like

2017
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:24,159
whoa they can still eat what they want

2018
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,760
they teach them that fruit is bad so

2019
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,159
these younger people naturally spread

2020
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,320
disinformation about fruit other places

2021
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:32,560
and other things around too and being

2022
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,679
that they know nothing about what causes

2023
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,239
illness even if they're a health

2024
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:40,199
professional they still have influence

2025
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:44,320
to take a powerful healing tool like

2026
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:46,119
fruit and toss it away away from someone

2027
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:48,080
who could have used it to save their

2028
01:29:46,119 --> 01:29:50,440
life or get a better life or better

2029
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:53,119
their life I hear it every day check

2030
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:55,000
this out I hear healing stories of

2031
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:57,280
people who say they were kept away from

2032
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,679
fruit by all of the propaganda and all

2033
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:01,040
the different people talking about it

2034
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:03,400
out there and they were told it was

2035
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:06,159
going to hurt them maybe even do worse

2036
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:08,080
than hurt them it would cause their gut

2037
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:10,600
health problems make them worse cause

2038
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,560
candid or leaky gut but they had nothing

2039
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,280
to lose because they weren't getting

2040
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,040
better any other way because they got

2041
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:19,440
that sick they got too sick so they took

2042
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,080
the plunge and learned how to use fruit

2043
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:25,000
as a healing tool properly and it blew

2044
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:28,280
their minds as they healed fruit

2045
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,679
demonizes don't know how to use fruit

2046
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:34,000
health professionals who are anti fruit

2047
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:36,679
don't know how to use fruit health

2048
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,800
professionals that like fruit and are

2049
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:41,600
Pro Fruit still don't know how to use

2050
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:44,639
fruit either but it's important to know

2051
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:47,199
that fruit demonizes especially not only

2052
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,679
don't know how to use fruit but let

2053
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:52,400
their ego control them so they don't

2054
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:57,239
even stay open to the possibility that

2055
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:59,239
fruit heals and they just stay

2056
01:30:57,239 --> 01:31:01,840
misinformed and they are making a

2057
01:30:59,239 --> 01:31:04,320
mistake a mistake that leaves countless

2058
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:07,440
people chronically ill who are eager to

2059
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:10,320
learn a way to heal occasionally fruit

2060
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:14,040
demonizer will say some berries are fine

2061
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:16,239
green Apple's fine green banana even

2062
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:19,560
they do that to appease levelheaded

2063
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:22,719
sensible people that don't fall for the

2064
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:24,639
anti Fruit game so it's a trick to make

2065
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,600
it look like they're still Pro Fruit but

2066
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,679
they're doing it sensibly you know like

2067
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:30,600
no just a little this little that but

2068
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:33,480
who cares if you're sick and you're kept

2069
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,800
from an answer one of the real answers

2070
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:38,880
one of the real healing tools and one of

2071
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:41,480
the answers that fruit is good see how

2072
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:45,480
there's Darkness behind everything when

2073
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:48,639
you scratch the surface people suffer

2074
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:50,800
when there's healing tools available you

2075
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:54,199
know does the word Darkness like bother

2076
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,159
you I look at it this way if innocent

2077
01:31:54,199 --> 01:31:58,920
good people are suffering from chronic

2078
01:31:56,159 --> 01:32:02,520
illness and answers are kept from them

2079
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:05,600
for devious reasons of any kind and

2080
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,040
someone's laying in bed with no answers

2081
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,480
and one of the things that can be

2082
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:13,080
helpful is kept from them it's

2083
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:16,440
darkness and just because professional

2084
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:17,679
fruit haters don't know how to use fruit

2085
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:20,440
as a

2086
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:24,480
tool they would rather throw it under

2087
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:28,639
the bus along on with the people who are

2088
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:31,920
sick the spiritual war we are facing

2089
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:35,520
both here around us and above us can

2090
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:39,840
only be one if we know the game Darkness

2091
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:42,880
plays and darkness is uncaring of anyone

2092
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,760
and it holds no compassion and it

2093
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,520
despises the

2094
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,800
light the fruit trees and the brambles

2095
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,320
and the fruit

2096
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:56,040
Vines have given us love life throughout

2097
01:32:52,320 --> 01:33:00,199
the centuries because they are of the

2098
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:03,920
light but like anything and everything

2099
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:06,719
Darkness trains us to take it all for

2100
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,600
granted and why was fruit mentioned over

2101
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:12,600
300 times in the Bible because it

2102
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:15,280
mattered to someone and there's a deep

2103
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,600
connection because fruit is a

2104
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:21,000
lifegiver not a

2105
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,119
lifetaker fruit signifies renewal of

2106
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,719
life

2107
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:28,600
as the darkness shuns the fruit and the

2108
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:29,840
evildoers kill the fruit trees over time

2109
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,480
the Angels

2110
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:36,360
Cry as the fruit trees

2111
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:39,119
die ignorance and greed is a great part

2112
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:41,800
of why we are sick the ones that are

2113
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:44,760
supposed to protect us here on Earth

2114
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:47,679
only Mastermind how to harm

2115
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,239
us and hold us back from what's

2116
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:52,719
rightfully ours as we are led the wrong

2117
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:56,719
way regardless of who who we

2118
01:33:52,719 --> 01:34:00,119
are fruit hatred gives us Insight that

2119
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:03,119
the spiritual war is real you can see

2120
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:05,480
the signs everyone knows there's

2121
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:08,719
corruption in all the industries and

2122
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:11,840
they're seeing it more than ever before

2123
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,639
but oddly enough no one thinks there's

2124
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,760
corruption in alternative holistic

2125
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:18,400
medicine and the Alternative Health

2126
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:22,159
Information that goes around we think if

2127
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:25,360
it's holistic it's pure and holy

2128
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:28,239
no ill intentions at all and for some

2129
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:31,080
reason the conventional medicine World

2130
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:33,159
released a magical fairy that has

2131
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:36,639
allowed the Alternative Health movement

2132
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:37,520
to be creative and do as it pleases but

2133
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,040
that's

2134
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:43,440
impossible there are facets of it we

2135
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:46,080
don't realize ruled by the hierarchy

2136
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:48,760
over time as they work on breaking our

2137
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:51,520
thoughts and breaking our minds so what
