[0.00 - 6.06] today we're talking about chemicals
[2.76 - 8.18] we're talking about sea trails
[6.06 - 8.18] um
[9.54 - 15.02] we're also talking in code
[11.94 - 15.02] major code today
[18.12 - 23.22] big topic today
[20.04 - 25.80] we're also in day four with day in four
[23.22 - 28.32] day four day five which stays at six day
[25.80 - 29.94] three we got 20 days ahead of us we're
[28.32 - 31.26] day four of the medical medium brain
[29.94 - 34.20] shot therapy
[31.26 - 35.94] cleanse challenge I got brain saver here
[34.20 - 38.94] we're gonna be talking about some sea
[35.94 - 40.68] trails and some chemical stuff
[38.94 - 44.10] it's going to be a really interesting
[40.68 - 45.84] talk I hope you guys hang out for it
[44.10 - 47.70] you see a bunch of ingredients here
[45.84 - 50.60] because we're going to be making
[47.70 - 54.12] the sea Trails
[50.60 - 55.92] exposure shot
[54.12 - 59.36] but you might be thinking I'm not
[55.92 - 59.36] exposed to Sea Trails
[60.74 - 67.26] so you think
[63.06 - 72.54] but everybody is everybody is on this
[67.26 - 75.80] planet is exposed to the Sea Trails I
[72.54 - 78.30] can promise you that mark my words
[75.80 - 79.68] everybody's exposed to the seashells but
[78.30 - 81.42] we're talking and remember we're talking
[79.68 - 84.42] some kind of code but we're gonna be
[81.42 - 86.10] reading about sea trails in this brain
[84.42 - 88.98] saver book
[86.10 - 90.90] so we got to be you know cool about that
[88.98 - 93.84] what you see right here is some lemons
[90.90 - 97.86] you see some kale really actually nice
[93.84 - 99.36] kale too like whoa that's really nice
[97.86 - 101.04] kale
[99.36 - 102.42] and then we got some asparagus right
[101.04 - 103.80] there we got some brussels sprouts some
[102.42 - 105.84] brussels sprouts don't look that good
[103.80 - 108.36] because I had to peel them back and peel
[105.84 - 109.56] them back they were like in some bad
[108.36 - 111.48] shape
[109.56 - 113.64] I got some chives and a little bit of
[111.48 - 116.52] green onions scallions which you'll use
[113.64 - 119.46] I got some cilantro
[116.52 - 121.68] and I got some celery right here
[119.46 - 124.26] so those are my ingredients I got my
[121.68 - 125.76] shot glasses right here this is day four
[124.26 - 127.86] of the medical medium brain shot therapy
[125.76 - 131.10] cleanse challenge that's a mouthful say
[127.86 - 132.96] that three times in a row really fast
[131.10 - 134.28] anyway you guys coming on because we're
[132.96 - 136.44] gonna be talking about some serious
[134.28 - 138.24] chemical crap and it's gonna be really
[136.44 - 139.68] fun so I want everybody to come on or
[138.24 - 142.08] whoever's coming on because we're going
[139.68 - 146.28] to talk about this
[142.08 - 150.12] because I want to drop a few bombs
[146.28 - 151.44] c h e m I'm gonna do some cheerleading
[150.12 - 154.50] stuff right
[151.44 - 156.30] give me a c give me an H give me an e
[154.50 - 159.84] give me an m
[156.30 - 161.40] give me a t give me an R give me an a i
[159.84 - 163.58] l s
[161.40 - 163.58] foreign
[167.88 - 173.96] does AI know what does it spell
[171.36 - 173.96] all right
[174.00 - 178.62] stop messing around
[176.10 - 179.46] we got we got some work to do okay all
[178.62 - 182.94] right
[179.46 - 187.26] we're here we're talking about chemicals
[182.94 - 188.94] on the brain man chemicals
[187.26 - 190.50] we're talking about some serious crap
[188.94 - 193.32] and I'm not kidding about this all right
[190.50 - 195.72] let me just start reading forget this
[193.32 - 197.64] start reading I'll read anything
[195.72 - 199.68] add a brain saver
[197.64 - 202.82] I'm gonna just start on page 220 let's
[199.68 - 202.82] go in there for a little bit
[203.16 - 207.18] when we speak of chemicals we are
[205.20 - 209.76] speaking of any kind of chemical created
[207.18 - 211.92] by the chemical industry
[209.76 - 214.26] whether we know that chemical exists
[211.92 - 217.74] inside a product or not
[214.26 - 219.24] chemical companies are Exempted for the
[217.74 - 223.26] most part
[219.24 - 226.08] from full disclosure in labeling
[223.26 - 227.94] they have free reign in the creation and
[226.08 - 230.04] use of their chemicals because they
[227.94 - 232.26] produce so many different chemicals for
[230.04 - 233.76] so many different Industries they got
[232.26 - 236.10] free reign
[233.76 - 239.10] this is just interesting in general but
[236.10 - 242.96] wait do you guys hear about sea trails
[239.10 - 242.96] wait do you hear about that
[243.60 - 249.24] this is a fun day
[246.44 - 252.90] there's no proper regulatory system
[249.24 - 256.50] designed to monitor Safeguard calculate
[252.90 - 258.18] and keep track chemicals
[256.50 - 260.52] it would take rebuilding the entire
[258.18 - 263.46] chemical industry and Beyond
[260.52 - 264.84] so what did that just say that just said
[263.46 - 267.60] that
[264.84 - 270.84] chemical industry
[267.60 - 274.04] worldwide has full reign
[270.84 - 274.04] create whatever they want
[274.20 - 280.86] without really being cataloged properly
[276.42 - 283.08] or monitored or understood
[280.86 - 286.20] thousand check this out this is really
[283.08 - 288.86] cool thousands of chemicals are churned
[286.20 - 288.86] out daily
[289.08 - 293.88] thousands of new chemicals are churned
[292.38 - 296.28] out daily by the way
[293.88 - 298.56] so they get thrown into extremely large
[296.28 - 301.98] categories instead of individually
[298.56 - 305.10] tested for safety so so many chemicals
[301.98 - 307.26] are turned out at once then instead of
[305.10 - 310.38] each chemical
[307.26 - 314.00] being tested for safety
[310.38 - 314.00] they just throw them in batches
[314.40 - 319.56] you can have 10 000 chemicals in one
[317.58 - 321.78] category and have that category deemed
[319.56 - 324.20] safe by an authority think about that
[321.78 - 324.20] right there
[324.66 - 328.34] we got to be in code today man
[330.00 - 336.90] there's nobody talks about that stuff
[333.30 - 339.66] but I can't help it you can have 10 000
[336.90 - 341.10] chemicals in one category and have that
[339.66 - 343.32] category deemed safe by an authority
[341.10 - 345.78] think about this beretti ten thousand
[343.32 - 348.24] individual chemicals that were never
[345.78 - 351.42] tested
[348.24 - 353.90] the effects on human nature and nature
[351.42 - 353.90] nature
[354.54 - 358.98] wildlife
[357.12 - 361.02] more than 5 000 of them are
[358.98 - 362.94] life-threatening in large dosages while
[361.02 - 364.86] the other four thousand plus chemicals
[362.94 - 368.64] may not cause immediate obvious health
[364.86 - 371.22] effects within the first decade of use
[368.64 - 373.08] yet with continual exposure will
[371.22 - 375.06] contribute to diseases symptoms and
[373.08 - 378.02] conditions as the years
[375.06 - 378.02] tick by
[379.44 - 383.88] there's such a vast array of chemicals
[381.72 - 385.32] in production for these domestic Invader
[383.88 - 389.10] products
[385.32 - 391.02] thousands upon thousands of chemicals
[389.10 - 394.32] once these chemicals enter our body
[391.02 - 398.94] through our nose through our mouth
[394.32 - 401.28] through our lungs right or skin
[398.94 - 403.80] they can saturate any aspect of the
[401.28 - 407.22] brain whether deep in the inner core of
[403.80 - 410.90] the brain stem or
[407.22 - 410.90] just in any lobe
[411.36 - 415.50] inside the hemispheres or the cerebral
[414.48 - 417.78] cortex
[415.50 - 420.00] some domestic Invaders are petrochemical
[417.78 - 421.80] derived when they settle into the brain
[420.00 - 423.42] domestic Invader products often end up
[421.80 - 425.40] deeper in the brain's grooves than other
[423.42 - 428.82] petrochemicals domestic Invader
[425.40 - 433.08] chemicals are created to have radio
[428.82 - 434.94] sorry radical absorption abilities and
[433.08 - 436.80] the brain is vulnerable and easy to
[434.94 - 439.80] invade so I'm just talking about how our
[436.80 - 441.12] brain can saturate get saturated by a
[439.80 - 443.88] tremendous amount of chemicals so the
[441.12 - 445.92] chemical industry creates thousands upon
[443.88 - 447.24] thousands upon thousands of chemicals
[445.92 - 450.66] constantly
[447.24 - 453.06] but each chemical itself is never tested
[450.66 - 456.06] as far as any kind of damages on
[453.06 - 458.46] Wildlife or human nature
[456.06 - 460.62] and but what they do is they batch the
[458.46 - 463.26] chemicals so chem the chemical industry
[460.62 - 464.58] batches the chemicals purposely
[463.26 - 467.34] so they don't have to go through any
[464.58 - 469.92] kind of regulatory system right
[467.34 - 472.88] say batcho
[469.92 - 472.88] I mean that's crazy
[473.06 - 478.26] different chemicals do different things
[475.44 - 479.94] there's no wall up that stops certain
[478.26 - 482.16] chemicals from entering any part of the
[479.94 - 486.18] brain they go past the blood-brain
[482.16 - 488.28] barrier oh no no medical medium you
[486.18 - 490.62] don't know anything about the brain
[488.28 - 493.62] the blood-brain barrier stops everything
[490.62 - 496.50] from going in it
[493.62 - 498.42] it's a barrier medical medium I can't
[496.50 - 500.64] tell you how many times I heard that
[498.42 - 502.50] the blood-brain barrier it stops
[500.64 - 503.82] everything bad from getting into your
[502.50 - 505.26] brain
[503.82 - 507.80] so you don't know anything medical
[505.26 - 507.80] medium
[511.62 - 516.48] this raises one of the foundational
[513.78 - 518.70] problems those chemicals these chemicals
[516.48 - 521.64] aren't brain tested so none of these
[518.70 - 524.04] chemicals are brain tested they're not
[521.64 - 526.02] they don't take a human being they used
[524.04 - 527.28] to by the way they used to do this but
[526.02 - 530.70] they didn't really look at the brand
[527.28 - 533.94] back in the 1920s they used to
[530.70 - 535.62] like experiment
[533.94 - 538.26] on humans
[535.62 - 540.48] and they would just have a ton of deadly
[538.26 - 542.34] chemicals dropped on their head
[540.48 - 545.06] and inhaled and on their skin and see
[542.34 - 545.06] what happens then
[552.36 - 557.34] Sophie Nordstrom says yet each
[555.06 - 560.04] individual chemical is constantly tested
[557.34 - 563.82] on animals in every country
[560.04 - 565.80] I know that chemicals are tested on
[563.82 - 568.32] animals but not each individual chemical
[565.80 - 570.72] it's impossible
[568.32 - 572.34] so that's something to know we're
[570.72 - 575.58] talking about
[572.34 - 578.58] millions of chemicals Millions created
[575.58 - 581.16] each year by chemical companies chemical
[578.58 - 583.98] Industries right around the world and
[581.16 - 586.14] known a fraction of those very small
[583.98 - 587.76] amount are tested on animals and they do
[586.14 - 590.10] test on animals out there in the world
[587.76 - 592.14] the diffraction
[590.10 - 594.24] the chemical company's chemical
[592.14 - 596.58] Industries are really the ones that are
[594.24 - 600.00] testing chemicals on animals it's
[596.58 - 603.24] product companies that did a lot of the
[600.00 - 604.92] testing on animals
[603.24 - 606.30] and so they don't even know from their
[604.92 - 608.04] tests what's really happening in the
[606.30 - 610.20] long term anyway when they do test on
[608.04 - 612.66] animals
[610.20 - 614.52] yes there's been a lot of tests on
[612.66 - 616.74] animals and still is
[614.52 - 618.54] in the industries in many of the
[616.74 - 620.34] industries that aren't even chemical
[618.54 - 622.26] based in their testing on animals we
[620.34 - 625.20] know that right
[622.26 - 626.88] horrific and horrifying all of it
[625.20 - 629.04] this raises one of the foundational
[626.88 - 630.66] problems these chemicals aren't brain
[629.04 - 633.36] tested it's not like the chemical
[630.66 - 635.28] industry knows what these chemicals can
[633.36 - 637.26] do inside the human brain or how they
[635.28 - 639.42] can penetrate the human brain so nobody
[637.26 - 641.76] knows how these chemicals actually
[639.42 - 644.28] penetrate the human brain there's no
[641.76 - 645.48] Authority overlooking this either by the
[644.28 - 648.36] way
[645.48 - 652.74] I mean that's insane if the chemical
[648.36 - 654.78] doesn't burn the hair off your arm
[652.74 - 657.36] then it goes to the next stage of
[654.78 - 660.24] testing for use no one's monitoring any
[657.36 - 662.70] of these chemicals entering the brain
[660.24 - 664.80] with current medical tools it's not even
[662.70 - 667.02] possible to monitor the full scope of
[664.80 - 669.18] these chemicals effects on the brain we
[667.02 - 671.88] can't just cut open someone's brain
[669.18 - 673.86] remove a portion and look for these
[671.88 - 675.24] chemicals so the industry's ultimate
[673.86 - 677.22] protection is that they're creating
[675.24 - 679.74] chemicals which affects the brain and
[677.22 - 680.82] can't be measured or monitored so keep
[679.74 - 683.10] this in mind
[680.82 - 684.48] and I'm on page 221 we're just reading a
[683.10 - 688.62] little bit about chemicals before we
[684.48 - 692.04] move on with this topic but keep in mind
[688.62 - 694.44] they can't even test on human brains you
[692.04 - 697.38] can't even test on a human brain because
[694.44 - 699.66] you have to cut the person's brain open
[697.38 - 701.40] to look inside and even if you cut the
[699.66 - 704.22] person's brain open to look inside
[701.40 - 705.48] you're still not going to see the
[704.22 - 708.54] chemicals
[705.48 - 710.82] so this is completely experimental on
[708.54 - 713.12] the planet what the chemical industry
[710.82 - 713.12] does
[714.62 - 719.64] meanwhile chemical industry domestic
[717.18 - 721.74] Invaders can create immune system
[719.64 - 723.72] weaknesses that allow brain diseases to
[721.74 - 725.88] take root feed viruses and fuel the
[723.72 - 727.86] creation of tumors these domestic
[725.88 - 730.38] Invaders also contain traces of toxic
[727.86 - 732.48] heavy metals and you know by now what
[730.38 - 734.10] those can do to your brain If You're
[732.48 - 736.70] Reading brain saver and brain saver
[734.10 - 736.70] protocols
[737.64 - 742.32] and experiment on humankind
[740.34 - 744.60] it's no if you guys just got on here
[742.32 - 747.78] we're talking about sea trails
[744.60 - 750.18] sea Trails sea trails
[747.78 - 751.32] and we're making the Sea Trail exposure
[750.18 - 753.36] shot and we're day four of the medical
[751.32 - 755.64] meme Branch out therapy

[755.64 - 758.94] encounter and use these products all the
[757.68 - 760.14] time there's a lot of products out there
[758.94 - 762.72] that are saturated and dangerous
[760.14 - 764.40] chemicals people don't even realize

[796.38 - 800.46] to do and you can choose your own shops
[798.18 - 803.36] you don't have to do the shots that I
[800.46 - 803.36] have chosen here
[806.88 - 810.96] it's no secret that we encounter and use
[809.10 - 813.00] these products all the time what's
[810.96 - 814.92] hidden is what their ingredients do to
[813.00 - 818.40] us humankind is one big chemical
[814.92 - 820.68] industry experiment right now
[818.40 - 822.60] how many dangerous chemicals can a
[820.68 - 824.52] person sop up in their lifetime before
[822.60 - 826.02] it becomes apparent that it's hindering
[824.52 - 828.00] their health and well-being and even
[826.02 - 831.72] injuring them
[828.00 - 833.82] it's almost like a joke or a prank
[831.72 - 835.74] how far can the chemical industry push
[833.82 - 837.66] the envelope before it's blatantly
[835.74 - 840.12] obvious
[837.66 - 843.72] the key to chemical industry domestic
[840.12 - 845.88] Warfare is to slip every day items
[843.72 - 847.98] through the door and never have the
[845.88 - 849.78] finger pointed at whatever evil is
[847.98 - 853.20] slipping through that door it's the
[849.78 - 854.82] ultimate Con on humankind
[853.20 - 858.24] that's incredible
[854.82 - 859.62] it's unbelievable right
[858.24 - 861.72] right
[859.62 - 864.00] Danielle says you're the best changed my
[861.72 - 866.88] life and my kids incredible
[864.00 - 869.28] I'm so glad you're here
[866.88 - 872.76] Lorena L tried the pathogen exposure
[869.28 - 875.52] shot today really liked it garlic also
[872.76 - 877.14] added wow
[875.52 - 878.70] all right you guys we're going to move
[877.14 - 881.16] on we're gonna read a little bit more I
[878.70 - 882.36] want to go to the next part okay so
[881.16 - 886.10] right now
[882.36 - 886.10] and I am looking for the next part
[886.62 - 889.94] I think uh
[893.88 - 897.74] look for page two
[900.36 - 903.68] come on let's get through this
[906.12 - 909.08] oh yeah
[910.56 - 913.86] foreign
[911.58 - 915.30] so let's read a little bit here in this
[913.86 - 916.86] next part you guys if you want to know
[915.30 - 917.94] where I am
[916.86 - 919.86] because I don't know where I am right
[917.94 - 922.38] now where am I
[919.86 - 924.42] I am in the brain saver book
[922.38 - 925.86] okay we're gonna be making the sea
[924.42 - 929.00] Trails exposure shot but I'm talking
[925.86 - 929.00] about sea Trails a little bit
[930.24 - 933.90] there are 100
[931.50 - 935.64] thousands of chemicals used in our
[933.90 - 937.80] Industries every day
[935.64 - 941.34] they're put in our food
[937.80 - 943.82] they're put in our cleaning supplies
[941.34 - 947.40] they're used in every thing that's
[943.82 - 950.10] manufactured many of these chemicals
[947.40 - 952.86] are so toxic that if the human body were
[950.10 - 956.84] dipped into a vat of these chemicals it
[952.86 - 956.84] would be a very quick death
[960.78 - 966.06] under storage containers these chemicals
[963.36 - 968.76] carry the death warning
[966.06 - 971.76] the death warning on these storage
[968.76 - 976.10] containers of these chemicals
[971.76 - 976.10] a skull and crossbones
[978.42 - 983.76] and every single chemical that's
[980.40 - 985.62] manufactured for industrial use equals
[983.76 - 987.84] thousands upon thousands of gallons of
[985.62 - 989.28] waste check that out every single
[987.84 - 991.50] chemical and there's hundreds and
[989.28 - 994.20] hundreds of thousands of them every
[991.50 - 996.48] single chemical used for industrial use
[994.20 - 998.70] leaves by product
[996.48 - 1001.10] that people have no idea to the level
[998.70 - 1004.04] what page Melvin Knight asks on YouTube
[1001.10 - 1008.36] page 234
[1004.04 - 1010.58] page 234 the paragraph starts
[1008.36 - 1012.92] at there are hundreds of thousands of
[1010.58 - 1014.60] chemicals used
[1012.92 - 1017.06] in our Industries
[1014.60 - 1019.36] so check this out every single chemical
[1017.06 - 1022.52] that's manufactured for industrial use
[1019.36 - 1026.62] equals this is insane thousands upon
[1022.52 - 1026.62] thousands of gallons of waste
[1027.08 - 1031.66] from the chemicals Inception to the
[1029.66 - 1035.24] chemicals released in the marketplace
[1031.66 - 1037.46] thousands upon thousands of byproduct
[1035.24 - 1039.38] gallons the amount of byproduct that
[1037.46 - 1041.60] results from perfecting that one
[1039.38 - 1043.96] chemical far surpasses anyone's
[1041.60 - 1047.12] imagination
[1043.96 - 1049.28] millions of gallons can be produced of
[1047.12 - 1054.04] byproduct waste as they're perfecting
[1049.28 - 1054.04] one single chemical for industrial use
[1055.04 - 1058.76] but you guys know where I'm going right
[1056.84 - 1060.80] you guys know where I'm heading do you
[1058.76 - 1063.80] guys know the inside info right here of
[1060.80 - 1066.08] like to where I'm heading for real like
[1063.80 - 1068.54] the inside
[1066.08 - 1071.96] right info
[1068.54 - 1074.92] you guys you guys get it right
[1071.96 - 1078.02] in the old days Industries
[1074.92 - 1080.68] just dumped chemical waste right into
[1078.02 - 1080.68] rivers
[1081.86 - 1086.42] in the old days
[1084.02 - 1088.52] it was dumped into rivers right
[1086.42 - 1090.14] you know that
[1088.52 - 1092.48] the chemical industry just dumped it
[1090.14 - 1093.74] into rivers in the old days you hear
[1092.48 - 1096.16] what I'm going now
[1093.74 - 1102.38] in the old days
[1096.16 - 1105.28] mm6123 on IG they say sea Trails cause
[1102.38 - 1105.28] Morgellons
[1108.08 - 1112.16] they're actually
[1109.90 - 1115.64] repeating medical medium information
[1112.16 - 1117.56] that was put out there years ago
[1115.64 - 1120.38] and you're repeating it back to Medical
[1117.56 - 1121.40] medium which is always like a trip for
[1120.38 - 1123.92] me
[1121.40 - 1127.16] it's always I plant seeds over the
[1123.92 - 1130.36] decades and when the seeds come back
[1127.16 - 1130.36] it's always like a trip
[1131.84 - 1137.30] that is soc's information
[1135.14 - 1139.58] all right so ready
[1137.30 - 1141.38] in the old days Industries just dumped
[1139.58 - 1143.06] chemical waste right into rivers we know
[1141.38 - 1144.50] that right into oceans we know that
[1143.06 - 1145.64] right chemicals were just dumped into
[1144.50 - 1147.50] oceans
[1145.64 - 1149.12] the old days you guys hear what I'm
[1147.50 - 1151.46] saying though the old days not today the
[1149.12 - 1154.34] old days
[1151.46 - 1156.92] and chemicals were dumped in and on the
[1154.34 - 1158.36] land right in the old days in and on the
[1156.92 - 1160.94] land
[1158.36 - 1163.46] the chemical industry cannot dump into
[1160.94 - 1166.18] our lakes in waterways and oceans to the
[1163.46 - 1166.18] same degree anymore
[1166.70 - 1172.36] by the way I put out a sea Trails
[1168.56 - 1172.36] podcast a few years ago
[1173.48 - 1177.68] get ready for this point right here
[1175.82 - 1180.92] seriously
[1177.68 - 1183.92] this is like this is on freaking
[1180.92 - 1183.92] believable
[1187.34 - 1191.24] in the old days all the chemicals were
[1189.26 - 1194.18] dumped into the rivers the ocean the
[1191.24 - 1196.04] land right and lakes
[1194.18 - 1198.08] but the chemical industry is producing
[1196.04 - 1200.08] more chemicals now than they ever did
[1198.08 - 1203.30] before the chemical industry is
[1200.08 - 1205.58] producing more than ever before in our
[1203.30 - 1208.22] history
[1205.58 - 1210.80] there's billions of more people on the
[1208.22 - 1213.88] planet now there's that much more
[1210.80 - 1213.88] industry now
[1215.54 - 1222.08] there's that much byproduct produced by
[1217.94 - 1222.08] all the chemical Industries
[1222.26 - 1227.84] but yet it's not in the Lakes it's not
[1225.56 - 1229.28] being dumped in the ocean anymore it's
[1227.84 - 1231.86] not picked up there wouldn't be an ocean
[1229.28 - 1233.60] left because there's that much chemical
[1231.86 - 1235.10] created do you guys see where I'm
[1233.60 - 1236.30] heading you guys know what I'm talking
[1235.10 - 1238.34] about right
[1236.30 - 1240.56] it can't be dumped in a river anymore it
[1238.34 - 1242.60] would end the river's life if it was
[1240.56 - 1244.10] dumped in a river it would destroy an
[1242.60 - 1245.96] entire River now there's that much
[1244.10 - 1248.12] chemical being produced the industry is
[1245.96 - 1249.74] producing but in the old days there was
[1248.12 - 1251.24] not a lot of chemical being produced in
[1249.74 - 1252.86] the old days and it was just dumped
[1251.24 - 1255.38] straight into rivers until finally they
[1252.86 - 1256.64] said they knew they had to stop
[1255.38 - 1259.70] let's see
[1256.64 - 1262.70] the chemical industry cannot leach into
[1259.70 - 1264.98] our land to the same degree anymore
[1262.70 - 1267.80] with more chemicals being produced than
[1264.98 - 1270.98] ever before where does all the chemical
[1267.80 - 1274.22] waste go can you answer that question
[1270.98 - 1276.74] for me can you guys answer the question
[1274.22 - 1279.14] for me that should be the number one
[1276.74 - 1281.84] question on the planet Earth right now
[1279.14 - 1285.74] everybody says oh environment
[1281.84 - 1289.22] environment environment climate climate
[1285.74 - 1291.44] environment environment everybody's like
[1289.22 - 1293.30] gotta save the oceans everybody's like
[1291.44 - 1295.46] gotta save the oceans gotta Save the
[1293.30 - 1297.62] Fish that's what everybody's saying
[1295.46 - 1300.50] gotta save the bees the bees they're
[1297.62 - 1302.72] gonna die the bees environment
[1300.50 - 1305.26] the number one question that should be
[1302.72 - 1305.26] asked
[1306.20 - 1311.96] where does all the chemical waste go
[1309.50 - 1313.88] if it's not being dumped inside or on
[1311.96 - 1315.68] the land and it's not being dumped in
[1313.88 - 1317.90] the rivers anymore and it's not being
[1315.68 - 1320.54] dumped in the ocean anymore and it's not
[1317.90 - 1322.88] being dumped in The Lakes anymore
[1320.54 - 1325.04] but yet there's more chemical waste
[1322.88 - 1326.78] created now than ever before in history
[1325.04 - 1329.42] with the most chemicals made in
[1326.78 - 1333.38] byproduct made ever before in history
[1329.42 - 1337.48] then where does the chemical go is there
[1333.38 - 1337.48] a genius out there that knows that
[1338.66 - 1342.26] and by the way people that knows the
[1340.52 - 1343.94] chemical Industries having anything to
[1342.26 - 1345.74] do with sea Trails until a couple years
[1343.94 - 1347.06] ago when I released the original piece
[1345.74 - 1349.66] of information nobody knew in the
[1347.06 - 1349.66] chemtrail world
[1350.18 - 1353.66] try to say as fast as possible and hopes
[1352.22 - 1357.94] that it blips by
[1353.66 - 1357.94] by the way happy birthday Michelle L
[1361.76 - 1365.96] Michelle L happy birthday because I know
[1364.16 - 1367.70] it's your birthday today
[1365.96 - 1369.20] it's a blessing to have you on this
[1367.70 - 1372.04] planet it's a blessing to have you in
[1369.20 - 1372.04] the medical immune community
[1372.32 - 1374.86] truly
[1377.06 - 1382.04] with more chemicals being produced than
[1378.92 - 1383.84] ever before in history where does all
[1382.04 - 1386.72] the chemical waste go
[1383.84 - 1389.42] there's too much chemical byproduct and
[1386.72 - 1392.96] no place to store it and release it
[1389.42 - 1395.54] you can't store the chemical byproduct
[1392.96 - 1398.24] the industry is producing billions of
[1395.54 - 1400.94] gallons across the world the planet but
[1398.24 - 1403.10] there's no place to store it they can't
[1400.94 - 1405.26] dump it into the river so where does it
[1403.10 - 1408.80] go
[1405.26 - 1411.14] it can't be recycled
[1408.80 - 1413.90] it's not like a plastic bottle you threw
[1411.14 - 1419.08] in the recycle bin
[1413.90 - 1421.40] and so this is the chemical industry
[1419.08 - 1423.38] since the chemical industry cannot
[1421.40 - 1426.26] dispose of their wasted the ways they
[1423.38 - 1429.38] once did which was the rivers the Lakes
[1426.26 - 1434.56] and the land and the ocean
[1429.38 - 1434.56] now chemicals are being
[1434.90 - 1438.14] I don't know they're just out there you
[1436.58 - 1441.20] guys who want to do do you guys play
[1438.14 - 1445.00] with paper planes at all
[1441.20 - 1445.00] you guys ever make paper planes
[1450.80 - 1453.40] anyway
[1456.70 - 1461.49] [Laughter]
[1488.78 - 1491.78] foreign
[1498.80 - 1501.52] anyway
[1506.08 - 1510.68] sea trails are composed of very top of
[1508.94 - 1513.32] every toxin possible that the chemical
[1510.68 - 1515.06] industry creates this includes toxic
[1513.32 - 1517.52] heavy metals such as mercury and copper
[1515.06 - 1519.20] it also includes old outdated Antiquated
[1517.52 - 1521.08] chemical storage bins that have been
[1519.20 - 1524.00] backlogged in storage for decades
[1521.08 - 1526.64] chemical waste that has sat in tanks for
[1524.00 - 1528.68] 60 70
[1526.64 - 1531.20] and 50 years I don't know why I want the
[1528.68 - 1533.36] 080 or even 100 years
[1531.20 - 1536.68] It's a combination of chemicals both old
[1533.36 - 1536.68] and new being placed in
[1541.02 - 1544.14] [Music]
[1544.76 - 1547.72] and dumped
[1548.06 - 1554.06] it's just a theory
[1550.70 - 1556.66] doesn't mean any of it's true I'm just
[1554.06 - 1556.66] having fun
[1558.98 - 1562.82] you know it's crazy right now because
[1561.26 - 1564.08] everybody's worried about this planet
[1562.82 - 1566.06] they're worried about the Earth they're
[1564.08 - 1567.62] worried about the environment they're
[1566.06 - 1570.68] worried about whatever climate they're
[1567.62 - 1572.54] worried about all this stuff and
[1570.68 - 1576.20] literally
[1572.54 - 1580.12] one of the most diabolical situations
[1576.20 - 1581.84] that can ever exist in in any history
[1580.12 - 1584.54] anywhere
[1581.84 - 1587.18] on this planet in any time frame is
[1584.54 - 1589.58] happening now and it's like the craziest
[1587.18 - 1594.32] thing when you think about it right so
[1589.58 - 1597.02] everybody is just exposed so it's fear
[1594.32 - 1601.00] of compassion did was because we can't
[1597.02 - 1604.94] avoid this exposure it's not
[1601.00 - 1607.40] avoidable the exposure
[1604.94 - 1610.22] right
[1607.40 - 1613.70] because we can't avoid it we have to
[1610.22 - 1616.52] protect yourself so empowerment occurs
[1613.70 - 1619.52] right it's important to empower
[1616.52 - 1622.96] ourselves and our families and our
[1619.52 - 1622.96] children and everything else
[1623.06 - 1627.32] so
[1624.92 - 1631.58] and you got like you got all the
[1627.32 - 1635.24] different concerns about the environment
[1631.58 - 1636.80] but this brain shot therapy is here to
[1635.24 - 1639.08] help that's the whole point because we
[1636.80 - 1641.60] can't avoid exposure it's not possible
[1639.08 - 1643.10] unless you don't want to go outside if
[1641.60 - 1645.74] you don't want to go outside but that's
[1643.10 - 1647.66] the thing inside too we're exposed
[1645.74 - 1650.78] because the air outside is the air we
[1647.66 - 1652.40] breathe inside inevitably or you would
[1650.78 - 1655.52] just
[1652.40 - 1658.94] lose oxygen inside your home
[1655.52 - 1662.18] wherever you live so everything that we
[1658.94 - 1664.94] breathe in inside our home is air that's
[1662.18 - 1667.82] coming inevitably from outside so we do
[1664.94 - 1669.38] get we do get exposed so we're all
[1667.82 - 1671.72] exposed
[1669.38 - 1674.36] the entire planet is exposed right
[1671.72 - 1677.74] everybody on the planet so it's not
[1674.36 - 1677.74] about being afraid
[1678.44 - 1681.26] and just so you know to make things
[1680.18 - 1682.88] clear because there's a billion of
[1681.26 - 1684.68] questions if you have questions you can
[1682.88 - 1686.54] see in detail about what I'm talking
[1684.68 - 1688.58] about in brain saver if you don't have
[1686.54 - 1690.62] the brand saver book you won't have
[1688.58 - 1693.02] those details because I can't drop all
[1690.62 - 1695.12] the details over here
[1693.02 - 1696.92] foreign
[1695.12 - 1698.66] it's not the passage your commercial
[1696.92 - 1700.22] flights you know
[1698.66 - 1702.50] that a bunch of people are flying on
[1700.22 - 1704.66] that's not what it is but their details
[1702.50 - 1706.94] are in here which are really interesting
[1704.66 - 1710.68] really interesting to know but the point
[1706.94 - 1710.68] is is we don't have control
[1710.90 - 1718.16] over like this exposure nobody does but
[1713.96 - 1720.44] you have control to be aware and then
[1718.16 - 1722.36] do something about it if there's
[1720.44 - 1724.04] something available and the whole point
[1722.36 - 1725.80] of what Spirit of compassion did was
[1724.04 - 1728.62] Spirit compassion
[1725.80 - 1733.96] want it to have something available
[1728.62 - 1733.96] there was a synergistic combination
[1734.18 - 1741.92] that works just right
[1737.12 - 1745.10] for overall that type of aerosol
[1741.92 - 1748.04] right so what Spirit of compassion said
[1745.10 - 1750.10] it takes a little bit of celery a little
[1748.04 - 1753.38] bit of cilantro a little bit of of
[1750.10 - 1755.36] chives a little bit of Brussels
[1753.38 - 1757.22] a little bit of asparagus a little bit
[1755.36 - 1761.54] of kale and a little bit of lemon it's
[1757.22 - 1765.02] that exact chemical combination meaning
[1761.54 - 1769.04] food chemical meaning phytochemical
[1765.02 - 1772.64] compounds in food that exact combination
[1769.04 - 1775.28] that has an ability to help us Purge
[1772.64 - 1779.30] to help us Purge
[1775.28 - 1782.50] a well-rounded amount of aerosol you see
[1779.30 - 1786.86] the difference right there because it's
[1782.50 - 1791.54] released in an aerosol fashion
[1786.86 - 1793.42] so it takes a certain combination to
[1791.54 - 1796.76] help with this
[1793.42 - 1800.48] to actually help the body Purge
[1796.76 - 1802.46] chemical warfare that's in an aerosol
[1800.48 - 1805.52] form
[1802.46 - 1807.02] so Spirit of compassion wanted to offer
[1805.52 - 1809.66] something because
[1807.02 - 1812.06] there's there's nothing we can do about
[1809.66 - 1814.58] the exposure there's nothing anybody's
[1812.06 - 1816.26] going to do about the exposure
[1814.58 - 1819.08] it's just
[1816.26 - 1821.12] the way it works
[1819.08 - 1823.46] but we can do something to empower
[1821.12 - 1825.94] ourselves and protect ourselves very
[1823.46 - 1825.94] interesting
[1826.10 - 1831.86] we live in a world where we're being
[1828.20 - 1834.50] taught to Fear the Future of our climate
[1831.86 - 1837.26] at the same time there's a terrifying
[1834.50 - 1840.80] reality that's being ignored
[1837.26 - 1843.08] which is the unprecedented high level of
[1840.80 - 1845.36] dangerous chemical contamination and
[1843.08 - 1850.36] saturation being released
[1845.36 - 1850.36] within our sight onto our children
[1852.56 - 1858.04] I can't keep on reading too much of this
[1854.78 - 1860.78] though there's too many hot spots in it
[1858.04 - 1862.28] let's just figure this out we'll do some
[1860.78 - 1863.96] other stuff we'll actually do the shot
[1862.28 - 1865.22] and everything else I'm excited let me
[1863.96 - 1867.26] see if there's something else I can try
[1865.22 - 1869.92] to I'm trying to pick and choose what I
[1867.26 - 1869.92] could read out here
[1870.50 - 1874.34] oh here's the part that's really cool
[1873.20 - 1876.38] an IG
[1874.34 - 1878.90] clean up your diet that's your handle
[1876.38 - 1881.96] that's cool I've heard people saying it
[1878.90 - 1883.82] would cost a fortune the fly planes just
[1881.96 - 1885.80] to dump that how should I respond to
[1883.82 - 1888.80] that
[1885.80 - 1891.44] you gotta definitely read
[1888.80 - 1894.76] this because I talk about how that
[1891.44 - 1894.76] happens and why and all that
[1895.10 - 1898.24] and just so you know
[1898.46 - 1902.20] it's easy and can be done
[1904.10 - 1907.58] did you ever hear about thousands of
[1906.08 - 1908.90] birds falling out of the sky you guys
[1907.58 - 1910.34] ever hear that with thousands of birds
[1908.90 - 1913.00] are falling in this guy like thousands
[1910.34 - 1916.58] like ten thousands an entire migration
[1913.00 - 1920.74] down on the ground right
[1916.58 - 1920.74] that's from a migration of birds
[1921.10 - 1926.54] I know it's not like you know it would
[1923.84 - 1930.40] be migration sparrows or migration right
[1926.54 - 1930.40] Robin's a migration of like
[1931.88 - 1939.64] so that's from a migration of birds
[1934.52 - 1939.64] running into a very thick patch
[1941.30 - 1945.08] so that's from a migration of birds
[1943.16 - 1949.84] running
[1945.08 - 1949.84] from a very thick Pack patch right
[1953.30 - 1955.96] butter
[1959.96 - 1964.52] being poisoned in the sky and falling to
[1962.24 - 1967.04] their death it happens all over the
[1964.52 - 1970.16] planet in places you can't see we only
[1967.04 - 1972.74] recognize it when it happens you guys
[1970.16 - 1974.90] we only recognize it
[1972.74 - 1978.38] when it happens in it where it's in a
[1974.90 - 1981.92] visible place like in a city a village a
[1978.38 - 1985.22] town on the streets in the Town Center
[1981.92 - 1987.92] you don't see it when the patch they the
[1985.22 - 1992.86] birds hit happens in the woods somewhere
[1987.92 - 1992.86] in the mountains just so so much wastage
[1993.68 - 1997.76] Spirit of compassion told me that there
[1995.66 - 2000.30] isn't going to be Birds someday and this
[1997.76 - 2000.30] is the reason
[2002.68 - 2006.88] check this out right
[2004.42 - 2010.18] algae blooms and chemical clusters in
[2006.88 - 2012.64] oceans and lakes are from
[2010.18 - 2014.56] that as well
[2012.64 - 2016.48] causing schools of choked out fish and
[2014.56 - 2018.46] other sea life to wash up on the shore
[2016.48 - 2020.88] and people don't realize it it's from
[2018.46 - 2020.88] that
[2023.20 - 2028.60] I don't know I just thought it was a fun
[2025.12 - 2032.02] topic that's all to talk about
[2028.60 - 2035.86] and I thought I would put the Sea Trail
[2032.02 - 2037.66] exposure shot into the mix of the 20 day
[2035.86 - 2039.88] um brain shot therapy cleanse challenge
[2037.66 - 2043.08] because we're so exposed so I just
[2039.88 - 2043.08] thought it would be a great idea
[2044.32 - 2047.92] but they'll just tell you it's all your
[2045.88 - 2049.30] genes and your body attacking itself is
[2047.92 - 2051.22] what they'll tell you out there like
[2049.30 - 2053.74] it's all your genes and maybe it's all
[2051.22 - 2055.66] the birds genes too
[2053.74 - 2056.74] millions and millions of birds falling
[2055.66 - 2060.66] to their death
[2056.74 - 2060.66] it's all the birds genes now right
[2060.82 - 2064.78] sorry let's
[2062.62 - 2067.06] let's get into it
[2064.78 - 2068.86] it's not the pathogens and toxins it's
[2067.06 - 2070.66] not the pathogens going around and the
[2068.86 - 2073.86] toxins that we're up against no it's not
[2070.66 - 2073.86] that it's our genes
[2077.50 - 2080.86] but the part I think that bugs me the
[2079.84 - 2082.78] most
[2080.86 - 2084.70] I think one of the parts that like
[2082.78 - 2086.56] really gets on my nerves like the most
[2084.70 - 2088.30] when I really think about it
[2086.56 - 2090.40] is
[2088.30 - 2093.90] the fact that
[2090.40 - 2093.90] we know what's happening
[2094.18 - 2099.82] and everybody who has power in the world
[2097.30 - 2103.68] knows it's happening
[2099.82 - 2103.68] but it just keeps on happening
[2105.16 - 2108.82] but yet we're supposed to worry about
[2107.08 - 2112.66] other things
[2108.82 - 2114.76] right Sarah says doesn't the Bible talk
[2112.66 - 2117.48] about the ocean turning red yes it does
[2114.76 - 2117.48] indeed
[2117.64 - 2121.32] yeah and the red tide
[2123.00 - 2127.08] all right come on let's lighten it up
[2125.38 - 2130.66] let's move on let's make the shot
[2127.08 - 2132.28] lighten things up a little bit
[2130.66 - 2133.42] so what we're doing is we're protecting
[2132.28 - 2136.54] our brain
[2133.42 - 2138.52] from these chemicals now you don't have
[2136.54 - 2140.44] to do this shot every single day but
[2138.52 - 2142.54] it's a great shot to do periodically
[2140.44 - 2144.88] like I'll do it for a couple of days
[2142.54 - 2146.50] then I'll wait after a while do it for
[2144.88 - 2149.02] another couple of days it's just an
[2146.50 - 2151.66] incredible option
[2149.02 - 2153.94] listen
[2151.66 - 2157.06] I don't want anybody to be like worried
[2153.94 - 2160.48] or upset right because we have the tools
[2157.06 - 2163.12] and we have the power in our own lives
[2160.48 - 2165.46] we can take care of ourselves right we
[2163.12 - 2167.32] can do things we can we can get medals
[2165.46 - 2170.44] out we can do heavy metal detox
[2167.32 - 2173.08] protocols right we can do incredible
[2170.44 - 2174.94] tools we can do celery juice we have so
[2173.08 - 2178.84] many options to take care of ourselves
[2174.94 - 2181.18] and clean it up in our own bodies and
[2178.84 - 2182.56] own minds and that's the incredible part
[2181.18 - 2184.60] about it all
[2182.56 - 2186.16] and I didn't even talk about the scary
[2184.60 - 2187.06] stuff about it so I hope people aren't
[2186.16 - 2190.30] upset
[2187.06 - 2193.30] if you want the scary stuff
[2190.30 - 2195.88] read the brain saver book
[2193.30 - 2199.72] or go to Medical medium podcast to Apple
[2195.88 - 2203.34] podcast and listen to the episode the
[2199.72 - 2203.34] episode was a couple of years ago
[2205.54 - 2210.94] okay so I really like this shot
[2208.84 - 2212.62] I'm not a big fan of the taste of the
[2210.94 - 2214.48] shot the taste of the shots not so bad
[2212.62 - 2216.64] some of these shots they're hard to get
[2214.48 - 2219.52] down because they're not designed for
[2216.64 - 2221.50] flavors they're not designed for your
[2219.52 - 2225.12] flavor palette they're not designed for
[2221.50 - 2225.12] that that's not what it's about right
[2225.76 - 2231.10] honestly I wouldn't you know what if you
[2229.06 - 2232.18] have air fresheners pumping in your
[2231.10 - 2235.00] house
[2232.18 - 2238.00] that can be worse because it's directly
[2235.00 - 2239.80] directly in your face every second so
[2238.00 - 2241.66] what I recommend if you want to be
[2239.80 - 2244.00] empowered on any of the chemical warfare
[2241.66 - 2246.10] you take out your air fresheners and you
[2244.00 - 2248.56] throw them out you pull them out of the
[2246.10 - 2251.32] walls and get them from under the sinks
[2248.56 - 2253.78] and you throw them out first things
[2251.32 - 2256.12] first is the air fresheners that is one
[2253.78 - 2258.94] of the domestic chemical warfares of our
[2256.12 - 2260.74] time right the other thing is right you
[2258.94 - 2264.10] gotta be careful about cleaning products
[2260.74 - 2267.04] another thing too is detergents
[2264.10 - 2269.14] right with all those scented stuff all
[2267.04 - 2271.24] the fragrances all the scents I've been
[2269.14 - 2273.28] telling talking about this for years I
[2271.24 - 2275.26] remember three years ago three and a
[2273.28 - 2277.42] half years ago I think it almost four
[2275.26 - 2280.06] years ago now I was talking about how
[2277.42 - 2282.28] bad perfume colognes air fresheners and
[2280.06 - 2284.74] scented candles were and then then
[2282.28 - 2285.94] literally a bunch of people try to
[2284.74 - 2287.38] cancel me
[2285.94 - 2290.14] because
[2287.38 - 2291.52] they thought it was the stupidest thing
[2290.14 - 2293.92] to be talking about when there was
[2291.52 - 2296.26] something else going on in the world and
[2293.92 - 2299.86] they were like why is this guy talking
[2296.26 - 2301.78] about air fresheners and scented candles
[2299.86 - 2303.46] and they were trying to like rip me down
[2301.78 - 2305.32] over that and I'm still gonna talk about
[2303.46 - 2306.76] it and now you hear people talking about
[2305.32 - 2308.86] it now you'll see an influence out there
[2306.76 - 2310.36] yeah don't don't work don't do the
[2308.86 - 2311.50] fragrances oh where did you get that
[2310.36 - 2313.60] info
[2311.50 - 2316.24] when you stop using a lot of the super
[2313.60 - 2317.68] toxic chemical products right and you
[2316.24 - 2319.30] stop buying those chemicals with all
[2317.68 - 2320.26] those fragrances that they're selling
[2319.30 - 2323.20] out there
[2320.26 - 2327.58] they produce less of them
[2323.20 - 2329.14] so yes the power is in our hands to stop
[2327.58 - 2331.78] the industry
[2329.14 - 2334.66] from possibly creating more chemicals
[2331.78 - 2337.72] The Big Industry Giants in the world on
[2334.66 - 2339.40] the planet so it's true you know that's
[2337.72 - 2341.74] one way that could really hurt the
[2339.40 - 2345.10] chemical industry if people
[2341.74 - 2347.50] stop buying everything
[2345.10 - 2350.86] that sent it like that air fresheners
[2347.50 - 2353.02] fragrances chemicals perfumes clones all
[2350.86 - 2354.88] that stuff has stuff in it bad chemicals
[2353.02 - 2357.34] right and because of that they'll
[2354.88 - 2358.66] produce less
[2357.34 - 2360.58] but the air fresheners and their
[2358.66 - 2362.74] fragrances the bad chemical stuff has
[2360.58 - 2364.60] gotten so much more toxic than it ever
[2362.74 - 2366.48] was before 10 years ago and ever was
[2364.60 - 2370.30] before 20 years ago so we're up against
[2366.48 - 2371.80] chemicals now that are so toxic in all
[2370.30 - 2373.84] the fragrances it's like nothing
[2371.80 - 2376.00] anybody's ever seen so the chemical
[2373.84 - 2378.94] industry is creating fragrances that are
[2376.00 - 2380.80] so horrific at this point and yeah
[2378.94 - 2382.60] people stop using them and stop
[2380.80 - 2385.62] purchasing them you better believe they
[2382.60 - 2385.62] don't produce them anymore
[2385.78 - 2392.50] they're creating chemical sense and
[2389.40 - 2394.96] fragrances that actually stick around
[2392.50 - 2397.78] forever
[2394.96 - 2400.18] A Thousand Years could go by in a home
[2397.78 - 2403.54] that's been doused
[2400.18 - 2405.64] by a tremendous amount of fragrance
[2403.54 - 2407.56] if it preserved a thousand years later
[2405.64 - 2408.94] and they opened up that home A Thousand
[2407.56 - 2411.10] Years Later you would smell that
[2408.94 - 2413.44] chemical
[2411.10 - 2415.92] you're creating chemicals that won't go
[2413.44 - 2419.02] away but what you can do is you can stop
[2415.92 - 2421.78] taking in the new stuff like you can
[2419.02 - 2423.76] pull it out of your walls throw out the
[2421.78 - 2425.44] candles that are scented get it out so
[2423.76 - 2426.46] you're not constantly bringing more and
[2425.44 - 2429.04] more more
[2426.46 - 2431.62] meanwhile the scream about climate
[2429.04 - 2434.46] change meanwhile no one's talking about
[2431.62 - 2434.46] fragrances
[2435.40 - 2441.46] chemical Industries producing trillions
[2439.30 - 2443.44] of gallons of wasted chemicals that are
[2441.46 - 2445.42] just waste
[2443.44 - 2446.86] they're not talking about dryer sheets
[2445.42 - 2448.72] they're not talking about any of that
[2446.86 - 2451.62] they're not talking about sea trails
[2448.72 - 2451.62] should not talk about nothing
[2452.14 - 2455.22] all right let's make the shot
[2458.26 - 2464.14] Muhammad said guys listen to me I have
[2461.92 - 2466.84] followed the medical medium diet and I
[2464.14 - 2469.06] am healing from Vitiligo it works it
[2466.84 - 2470.92] really does what I what I really love
[2469.06 - 2472.90] about the medical medium information for
[2470.92 - 2476.86] Vitiligo is it's the only information
[2472.90 - 2480.90] that's how Vitiligo in anyone
[2476.86 - 2480.90] for years and years and years now
[2481.24 - 2484.92] don't worry the media the media won't
[2482.44 - 2488.20] cover that the media won't talk about
[2484.92 - 2490.54] reversing a Vitiligo with medical medium
[2488.20 - 2492.34] information which is like a miracle they
[2490.54 - 2493.96] won't cover that but instead they'll
[2492.34 - 2496.90] just do hip pieces after hit pieces
[2493.96 - 2499.84] whatever or some other smack will be
[2496.90 - 2502.18] talked about me but yet Vitiligo can't
[2499.84 - 2503.98] be healed they can't be healed out there
[2502.18 - 2507.10] but yet it can
[2503.98 - 2510.10] like mm info is reversing it in so many
[2507.10 - 2512.56] people like I I see it out there
[2510.10 - 2515.16] it's really special
[2512.56 - 2518.34] God bless you by the way
[2515.16 - 2518.34] all right
[2518.80 - 2523.18] I'm gonna put some kale in here quarter
[2520.66 - 2524.56] cup of tightly packed kale
[2523.18 - 2526.36] but I just want to talk about it it
[2524.56 - 2527.68] starts with frozen wild blueberries I
[2526.36 - 2529.90] don't have Frozen wild blueberries today
[2527.68 - 2531.88] so I have wild blueberry juice today is
[2529.90 - 2533.68] what I have so I'm gonna use that so you
[2531.88 - 2535.84] can have the option of using different
[2533.68 - 2538.54] wild blueberry
[2535.84 - 2540.82] um you know sources so I'm just saying
[2538.54 - 2543.88] put wild blueberries the key for this
[2540.82 - 2547.24] one a regular blueberry won't do it so a
[2543.88 - 2551.02] regular regular confident blueberry does
[2547.24 - 2554.32] not have enough anthocyanin to or
[2551.02 - 2556.30] phytochemical compounds to mix in with
[2554.32 - 2559.36] all these others to make something
[2556.30 - 2561.22] happen Nano chemicals are really really
[2559.36 - 2563.08] tiny these are Nano chemicals we're
[2561.22 - 2566.98] talking about septo chemicals the acto
[2563.08 - 2569.20] chemicals they're so tiny it's insane
[2566.98 - 2570.40] that's what kind of chemicals we're even
[2569.20 - 2572.56] talking about
[2570.40 - 2574.54] so yeah so wild blueberries the one of
[2572.56 - 2576.88] choice not the cultivated blueberry with
[2574.54 - 2580.06] the big the big bluebird
[2576.88 - 2582.88] Brett Winters where does the nanotech in
[2580.06 - 2585.40] the sky come from
[2582.88 - 2587.80] Fred wouldn't you did you just come in
[2585.40 - 2589.78] we're talking about it
[2587.80 - 2591.58] oh maybe you're saying where does it you
[2589.78 - 2593.08] know where it comes from up in the sky
[2591.58 - 2594.70] you're wondering where it comes from
[2593.08 - 2597.04] it's chemicals
[2594.70 - 2599.50] right and byproduct for the waste I was
[2597.04 - 2601.66] talking about from the industries
[2599.50 - 2603.58] if that was your question all right so
[2601.66 - 2605.20] on the wild blueberry front that's
[2603.58 - 2608.50] that's key but I'm gonna add the wild
[2605.20 - 2609.88] blueberry juice after right but if you
[2608.50 - 2611.62] have your wild blueberries like frozen
[2609.88 - 2613.00] wild boobers you can use that now and
[2611.62 - 2615.34] dump them in the first so I'm giving you
[2613.00 - 2617.86] a chance to do that
[2615.34 - 2619.48] the next one would be kale so a quarter
[2617.86 - 2622.38] cup technically packed kale so I'm gonna
[2619.48 - 2622.38] drop some kale in here
[2625.42 - 2628.08] nice
[2628.96 - 2632.58] it's not a quarter cup though
[2635.40 - 2639.34] if that was tightly packed that would
[2637.78 - 2641.20] that would definitely be probably a
[2639.34 - 2642.58] little over a quarter cup on that one
[2641.20 - 2646.12] right there but yeah
[2642.58 - 2647.98] quarter lemon peel let me get a lemon
[2646.12 - 2651.10] I get a lemon right here first of all
[2647.98 - 2653.14] I'm gonna peel it back if you don't mind
[2651.10 - 2655.90] I was supposed to probably do that
[2653.14 - 2657.70] earlier but
[2655.90 - 2660.10] so I'm peeling the lemon you don't have
[2657.70 - 2661.84] to peel it perfectly but this is the
[2660.10 - 2664.78] next thing by the way this is the MN
[2661.84 - 2666.46] 1500 it's on sale right now the mm-900
[2664.78 - 2669.04] is on sale too you guys know I work with
[2666.46 - 2671.62] the magnets incredible products
[2669.04 - 2673.42] I call them the medicine machine they
[2671.62 - 2675.40] save people money because they squeeze
[2673.42 - 2678.70] more juice out of stuff
[2675.40 - 2680.92] and they can handle real juicing
[2678.70 - 2683.08] medical medium Community juices like no
[2680.92 - 2685.48] other community in the world like it's
[2683.08 - 2688.32] it's unbelievable
[2685.48 - 2688.32] to the degree
[2688.60 - 2692.22] quarter lemon going down in there
[2693.10 - 2697.78] half cup tightly packed cilantro
[2695.38 - 2702.00] everybody
[2697.78 - 2702.00] half cup tightly packed cilantro
[2703.66 - 2707.28] let's get that in there
[2716.92 - 2722.04] tightly packed that's going to do it
[2718.66 - 2722.04] there that's incredible
[2722.74 - 2728.68] quarter cup tightly packed chives I got
[2726.04 - 2731.52] scallions and chives right here you can
[2728.68 - 2731.52] use either or
[2731.56 - 2736.54] if you have chives just use chives but
[2734.32 - 2738.70] I'm using a combination so I can show
[2736.54 - 2740.14] you guys in case you guys are like maybe
[2738.70 - 2744.64] someone's freaking out they're like I
[2740.14 - 2746.82] don't have chives I only have scallions
[2744.64 - 2746.82] foreign
[2754.26 - 2758.80] brussels sprouts now these brussels
[2756.46 - 2761.50] sprouts are so tiny I had to peel them
[2758.80 - 2762.78] back so I'm probably gonna put four in
[2761.50 - 2764.68] here
[2762.78 - 2767.68] because
[2764.68 - 2771.72] they really equal four or five of these
[2767.68 - 2771.72] will equal two good sized ones right
[2773.92 - 2778.18] there we go
[2776.14 - 2780.46] this has a high compression which is
[2778.18 - 2782.56] incredible this stuff is coming out dry
[2780.46 - 2784.48] that's what you want with the juicer and
[2782.56 - 2788.56] then the mn1500 does that
[2784.48 - 2791.62] in 900. two raw medium stocks
[2788.56 - 2794.20] of asparagus send you on through these
[2791.62 - 2796.30] are little ones so I'm gonna add
[2794.20 - 2798.04] I mean these are really small
[2796.30 - 2801.18] these are Spears
[2798.04 - 2801.18] you can call them Spears
[2802.30 - 2805.44] I'm gonna add those in
[2805.60 - 2809.34] half a stalk of celery is next
[2809.80 - 2816.24] we'll use this this is actually a short
[2811.84 - 2816.24] one and it's kind of tight and broken
[2817.12 - 2823.68] it's a celery stalk
[2820.96 - 2823.68] here we go
[2823.90 - 2828.22] that's my shot right there
[2826.78 - 2831.12] amazing
[2828.22 - 2831.12] I'm excited
[2834.04 - 2838.00] I'm letting it just trickle out a little
[2836.50 - 2839.38] bit more
[2838.00 - 2840.82] and then I'm adding a little bit of
[2839.38 - 2842.44] blueberry juice in the end of mine
[2840.82 - 2844.06] because you might have added the wild
[2842.44 - 2847.12] blueberries the Frozen wild blueberry
[2844.06 - 2850.80] ones right beforehand
[2847.12 - 2850.80] I'm adding a little after
[2851.20 - 2854.04] incredible
[2854.14 - 2860.22] I got a little screen here let's not
[2856.96 - 2860.22] knock over the blueberry juice
[2860.86 - 2863.70] amazing
[2865.54 - 2870.04] okay then I'm gonna add a little bit of
[2867.16 - 2872.94] blueberry juice to here too
[2870.04 - 2872.94] just a little bit
[2875.04 - 2880.32] that is the chemtrail exposure shot
[2877.78 - 2880.32] right there
[2880.90 - 2883.02] okay
[2885.72 - 2890.70] the music we didn't do a half time
[2892.62 - 2896.40] what was I thinking
[2898.18 - 2901.50] maybe we could do the robot down
[2903.10 - 2905.82] half time
[2908.26 - 2911.94] this is it you have your shot did you do
[2910.18 - 2914.62] yours already
[2911.94 - 2917.92] [Music]
[2914.62 - 2919.42] what's incredible about this okay is
[2917.92 - 2921.10] that no one would know that it's a
[2919.42 - 2923.50] combination of phytochemical compounds
[2921.10 - 2926.08] that are grown on this Earth we have
[2923.50 - 2928.66] medicine now think about this
[2926.08 - 2931.36] please think about this one point from
[2928.66 - 2934.02] Spirit of compassion if we have the
[2931.36 - 2937.72] ability to create chemical warfare
[2934.02 - 2939.76] domestic chemical warfare chemicals from
[2937.72 - 2942.46] the chemical industry on this planet
[2939.76 - 2944.86] that destroys life and the environment
[2942.46 - 2947.58] in which we live it if we have that
[2944.86 - 2950.86] ability as human beings to create
[2947.58 - 2954.16] dangerous concoctions of chemicals then
[2950.86 - 2956.50] surely if it comes from this planet that
[2954.16 - 2958.66] means the chemicals that are dangerous
[2956.50 - 2961.30] and lethal and problematic if they come
[2958.66 - 2963.10] from this planet then surely we have
[2961.30 - 2964.12] something from this planet that can help
[2963.10 - 2966.94] us
[2964.12 - 2971.98] and it's the food that's grown on this
[2966.94 - 2974.50] planet has mystery mystery
[2971.98 - 2976.06] powers
[2974.50 - 2978.82] to help us
[2976.06 - 2980.98] phytochemical compounds
[2978.82 - 2983.92] when they're mixed together
[2980.98 - 2985.30] just like chemicals dangerous chemicals
[2983.92 - 2987.58] in science
[2985.30 - 2989.92] have an effect
[2987.58 - 2991.24] and so in food when these phytochemical
[2989.92 - 2995.68] compounds
[2991.24 - 2998.50] are actually mingling with each other
[2995.68 - 3000.12] they ignite and something occurs fear of
[2998.50 - 3002.76] compassion
[3000.12 - 3005.82] has brought this information here so we
[3002.76 - 3008.58] can help protect ourselves
[3005.82 - 3009.57] so in a specific way when these
[3008.58 - 3011.84] ingredients come together
[3009.57 - 3014.34] [Music]
[3011.84 - 3016.32] synergistically the combinations that
[3014.34 - 3018.90] nobody knows about
[3016.32 - 3021.26] from above we have a way to protect
[3018.90 - 3021.26] ourselves
[3021.90 - 3026.18] and this is the medical media brain shot
[3023.70 - 3026.18] therapy
[3027.54 - 3035.48] this one's hitting me now like right now
[3031.26 - 3035.48] right when that first sip went down

[3241.38 - 3244.98] in my opinion it's the one thing I can
[3243.18 - 3248.22] say about them is the fact that they do
[3244.98 - 3250.80] that and they make them affordable for
