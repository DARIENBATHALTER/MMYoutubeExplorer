[0.00 - 1.96] [Music]
[0.32 - 3.72] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[1.96 - 5.68] listening to the medical medium radio
[3.72 - 8.04] show where each week I talk about the
[5.68 - 9.92] most advanced healing information
[8.04 - 11.84] secrets about health much of which is
[9.92 - 13.72] not found anywhere else in is decades
[11.84 - 17.84] ahead of what's out there now in fact
[13.72 - 20.12] Today's show is that very thing we're
[17.84 - 22.16] going to talk about Epstein bar we're
[20.12 - 24.08] going to talk about everything about it
[22.16 - 25.52] information it doesn't exist anywhere
[24.08 - 27.76] else and you're not going to hear it
[25.52 - 29.36] anywhere else it's not in any books it's
[27.76 - 32.52] not on the internet you're not going to
[29.36 - 33.96] hear it from any other person or expert
[32.52 - 36.60] and that's what we're doing today we
[33.96 - 39.68] need information that's 10 20 30 years
[36.60 - 43.08] ahead of the times in order to get
[39.68 - 46.16] better because who has 10 years to wait
[43.08 - 47.76] you know for answers we don't really I
[46.16 - 49.68] mean I know people have gone through
[47.76 - 51.56] where their their grandmother has gone
[49.68 - 53.80] through all these different waves of
[51.56 - 57.04] illness and chronic illness no answers
[53.80 - 58.72] at all ever just living with it and then
[57.04 - 60.24] you know and then it goes down to the
[58.72 - 61.96] mother having it and then the daughter
[60.24 - 64.32] having it and then even even farther
[61.96 - 67.32] back great-grandmother and you know we
[64.32 - 71.16] don't have just this kind of time to
[67.32 - 73.16] throw away life is precious and it means
[71.16 - 76.00] everything and our health means
[73.16 - 77.84] everything and this is a big show today
[76.00 - 79.12] and this means a lot what we got to
[77.84 - 83.32] cover today today's show is about
[79.12 - 86.00] Epstein bar virus revealed meet Epstein
[83.32 - 87.92] bar virus one of the biggest mystery
[86.00 - 91.28] illnesses causing millions of people to
[87.92 - 94.56] suffer today Epstein bars secretly
[91.28 - 96.88] behind debilitating conditions such as
[94.56 - 99.00] fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome
[96.88 - 100.64] all the different varieties of chronic F
[99.00 - 102.52] fatigue syndrome that we have multiple
[100.64 - 105.00] sclerosis rheumatoid
[102.52 - 108.76] arthritis thyroid disorders such as
[105.00 - 110.56] Hashimoto and much more join me today
[108.76 - 112.36] don't miss this show if you just tuned
[110.56 - 116.92] in stay with it because I'm going to
[112.36 - 119.44] reveal the historic truth about Epstein
[116.92 - 123.04] bar virus in this episode and I and I
[119.44 - 125.72] say that historic truth that no one
[123.04 - 128.48] knows it's that important today a little
[125.72 - 131.60] bit about me since the age of four woke
[128.48 - 133.84] up one morning heard a voice and it was
[131.60 - 136.52] what I call Spirit this voice has been
[133.84 - 139.40] with me my whole life at age 4 diagnosed
[136.52 - 141.20] my grandmother of lung cancer and uh
[139.40 - 144.28] weeks later they brought her in and she
[141.20 - 146.96] had lung cancer so the gift started
[144.28 - 149.36] there and for the rest of my life I've
[146.96 - 152.24] dedicated everything to getting people
[149.36 - 153.80] answered ERS so they knew what was going
[152.24 - 156.24] on I've helped tens of thousands of
[153.80 - 158.96] people recover their health reclaim
[156.24 - 161.52] their health understand their
[158.96 - 163.92] illnesses and re and gain control and
[161.52 - 166.00] move forward and heal it's been my
[163.92 - 167.48] life's purpose It's My Life journey I
[166.00 - 170.24] know everybody has a life purpose and
[167.48 - 172.76] journey we all do magical special things
[170.24 - 174.40] every single day in our lives and so I
[172.76 - 177.28] support your gift thank you for
[174.40 - 179.32] supporting Mine by being here and
[177.28 - 180.64] listening to the show it's it's just so
[179.32 - 183.68] important
[180.64 - 185.56] um so let's get started um you can see
[183.68 - 187.00] I'm you know I'm trying to get through
[185.56 - 188.72] things that the you know at the
[187.00 - 190.80] beginning is quick as I can almost
[188.72 - 193.00] because I want to make sure we get
[190.80 - 196.28] everything we can out of this show and
[193.00 - 199.36] this is so important
[196.28 - 201.88] um let's take a look here and see what's
[199.36 - 205.40] happening what you're going to hear
[201.88 - 209.76] today about Epstein bar it could be even
[205.40 - 211.84] shocking and it could be more than just
[209.76 - 214.80] shocking in this sense because it could
[211.84 - 218.04] be it's real it's revelational it is you
[214.80 - 220.52] know it can really wake up the mind and
[218.04 - 222.20] wake up the body unlike other because if
[220.52 - 223.72] you're dealing with symptoms and you're
[222.20 - 225.60] dealing with illness and you're dealing
[223.72 - 227.08] with conditions and you're not getting
[225.60 - 229.72] answers and you got fatigue and all
[227.08 - 232.04] these different things hearing the truth
[229.72 - 235.56] about what's going on could be pretty
[232.04 - 238.28] heavy and so with that I want you to
[235.56 - 240.40] just relax get a cup of tea get a cup of
[238.28 - 242.80] herbal tea of course
[240.40 - 244.60] and relax and listen to the show you
[242.80 - 248.28] know if you got a notepad or whatever
[244.60 - 250.40] take notes but what what I recommend is
[248.28 - 252.00] going back to the show in the archives
[250.40 - 254.20] because we're going to cover a lot of
[252.00 - 257.80] information I'm going to drop a lot of
[254.20 - 259.64] information down on everybody and so you
[257.80 - 262.28] might want to go back to this archive
[259.64 - 264.00] for sure and because we're going to run
[262.28 - 266.56] over a lot of things you may miss
[264.00 - 268.56] something and and you want to get every
[266.56 - 270.40] bit of it it's that important so I'm
[268.56 - 273.80] preparing you
[270.40 - 276.36] um so when it comes down to Healing
[273.80 - 280.40] especially healing with Epstein bar
[276.36 - 283.32] knowing the truth knowing the cause is
[280.40 - 286.40] half the battle to Healing it's why
[283.32 - 288.44] people don't heal so easily it's why so
[286.40 - 292.72] many people have chronic illness and
[288.44 - 293.72] don't have answers and basically what
[292.72 - 296.84] happens
[293.72 - 298.72] is that if we don't have answers if we
[296.84 - 300.48] don't know what's going on how is the
[298.72 - 302.76] healing going to start start see that's
[300.48 - 305.92] half the battle that's half of how it
[302.76 - 308.56] happens the other half is knowing what
[305.92 - 311.56] to do having answers on what to do what
[308.56 - 313.88] to address how to address for example
[311.56 - 316.72] Epstein bar and we're going to cover
[313.88 - 318.44] that so it's about knowing what's wrong
[316.72 - 322.60] that's half the battle knowing what to
[318.44 - 325.80] do to fix it to heal to move forward
[322.60 - 329.84] this is a big part of it all and that's
[325.80 - 332.44] why also why we're doing the show so to
[329.84 - 335.68] understand EP steam bar virus we have to
[332.44 - 338.92] hop into our time machine and set it for
[335.68 - 341.64] 1890 yeah I I said it 1890 that's what
[338.92 - 343.52] year we're going to so let's let's get
[341.64 - 347.08] ready and you know put the seat bels on
[343.52 - 349.60] for this at this time in history a
[347.08 - 352.88] harmless virus that was herpetic in
[349.60 - 356.40] nature so herpetic meaning like herpes
[352.88 - 360.16] herpetic in nature was redefining itself
[356.40 - 363.28] due to antibiotic experimentation
[360.16 - 365.44] this is antibiotic use before 1928 did
[363.28 - 368.64] you hear about the 1928 thing where
[365.44 - 371.28] penicillin was born that's when it was
[368.64 - 374.44] discovered and it was a huge Discovery
[371.28 - 376.00] penicillin it saved a lot of lives it
[374.44 - 378.60] was definitely an amazing it's an
[376.00 - 383.04] amazing Discovery in health history till
[378.60 - 385.28] today and so but right prior that there
[383.04 - 387.40] was also other types of antibiotics
[385.28 - 389.12] being used yes you won't see that on the
[387.40 - 391.40] internet you can look you may not find
[389.12 - 394.24] that different forms of
[391.40 - 396.96] antibiotics and this is the earlier
[394.24 - 398.44] Renditions of penicillin being used to
[396.96 - 400.96] treat various
[398.44 - 402.32] bacteria this was an amazing Discovery
[400.96 - 405.72] like I said before and it's helped so
[402.32 - 409.96] many other people but at the same time
[405.72 - 413.92] this harmless common herpetic natured
[409.96 - 416.12] virus which we named later epsteen bar
[413.92 - 419.92] was developing an intelligence and
[416.12 - 421.44] learning how to cope and maneuver around
[419.92 - 423.80] pre-
[421.44 - 426.44] antibiotics pre-time
[423.80 - 430.56] antibiotics and it began to use this
[426.44 - 433.68] early source of antibiotics as a food
[430.56 - 436.92] source now this wouldn't have been a big
[433.68 - 439.52] concern really or a big deal if there
[436.92 - 441.96] wasn't another Factor contributing
[439.52 - 446.24] another Factor occurring at the same
[441.96 - 449.36] time in the same era back in the late
[446.24 - 451.16] 1800s and this was early pesticide
[449.36 - 453.04] herbicide and fungicide use and
[451.16 - 454.48] development and you may say you may be
[453.04 - 456.76] someone that knows about pesticides and
[454.48 - 459.64] say well Anthony that's not true because
[456.76 - 462.68] pesticides really started in the late
[459.64 - 464.88] 30s and you know during the War Machine
[462.68 - 467.36] during you know that World War II where
[464.88 - 469.20] all the chemicals were made and all the
[467.36 - 472.68] pesticides were made and the
[469.20 - 476.24] DDT but there were pesticides before
[472.68 - 477.52] this time period before this time period
[476.24 - 481.20] and they were being developed in the
[477.52 - 483.84] late 1800s early 19 1900s they were made
[481.20 - 487.64] up of Arsenic and Lead what they were
[483.84 - 491.32] were arsenic sprays arsenic water
[487.64 - 494.64] arsenic spray Arsenic and Lead Vapor
[491.32 - 497.36] okay and this was fairly a fairly new
[494.64 - 500.20] exposure in our day and AG to us and our
[497.36 - 502.80] immune systems and it was on our food
[500.20 - 504.80] supply everywhere so you know how you go
[502.80 - 506.56] and get organic food cuz you don't want
[504.80 - 508.48] the pesticides today all the synthetic
[506.56 - 511.52] pesticides and everything well back then
[508.48 - 514.92] back before in the 1890s and right
[511.52 - 517.32] around 1900 there were sprays on
[514.92 - 519.24] everybody's food and nobody really even
[517.32 - 520.96] knew anything but the difference between
[519.24 - 523.56] organic or conventional because
[520.96 - 526.52] synthetic sprays weren't even invented
[523.56 - 528.24] yet to differentiate that this is
[526.52 - 529.72] serious this is something to understand
[528.24 - 532.12] here it's important factor what we're
[529.72 - 534.04] going through what we're talking about
[532.12 - 536.00] so instead there was these arsenic
[534.04 - 538.80] sprays and it was on everything it was
[536.00 - 541.08] laced down all this food and everyone
[538.80 - 542.88] had a big container a big container of
[541.08 - 546.16] it at home with a hand pump you know
[542.88 - 549.04] those antique you know bug killer pumps
[546.16 - 553.28] on and it would spray a vapor of Arsenic
[549.04 - 555.44] and Lead misted okay all of your plants
[553.28 - 557.24] all your garden plants all the fields
[555.44 - 558.92] that were you growing produce had this
[557.24 - 562.12] stuff the stuff was also being you know
[558.92 - 565.24] sprayed in all kinds of different ways
[562.12 - 567.88] this common herpetic virus we call
[565.24 - 571.12] Epstein bar now this common docile
[567.88 - 574.04] easygoing virus learned how to use toxic
[571.12 - 575.04] heavy metals such as Arsenic and Lead as
[574.04 - 578.92] its
[575.04 - 581.40] fuel it became fuel for this virus
[578.92 - 585.48] basically the Industrial
[581.40 - 588.64] Revolution was fueling and creating
[585.48 - 590.36] Epstein bar virus the Redevelopment of
[588.64 - 593.36] Epstein bar virus what I'm trying to say
[590.36 - 597.28] is Epstein bar was beginning to redefine
[593.36 - 600.72] itself and mutate by thriving on these
[597.28 - 604.32] toxic heavy metals including early
[600.72 - 607.08] antibiotics that were even pre-1 1928
[604.32 - 609.48] the penicillin age which also had heavy
[607.08 - 612.88] metals in them to begin
[609.48 - 615.12] with and that's how things were
[612.88 - 616.24] established so so we have to know this
[615.12 - 620.80] so by
[616.24 - 623.48] 1900 Epstein bar had established itself
[620.80 - 626.36] and had a hunger for arsenic lead and
[623.48 - 628.68] some Mercury and at this time our food
[626.36 - 631.72] supply was covered like I said in early
[628.68 - 634.28] PES side use of this compromised with
[631.72 - 636.64] all this comprised of all this Arsenic
[634.28 - 638.28] and Lead so when we would eat our food
[636.64 - 641.12] the Arsenic and Lead would quickly
[638.28 - 644.32] absorb get ready get ready for this it
[641.12 - 647.84] would quickly absorb into our
[644.32 - 649.96] thyroids into our thyroids so as you
[647.84 - 652.76] would eat this food that was everything
[649.96 - 655.60] was laced in Arsenic at this time period
[652.76 - 657.84] understand this this is serious stuff
[655.60 - 660.88] when it would enter your mouth the
[657.84 - 662.92] Arsenic would absorb into your cells of
[660.88 - 665.08] your mouth and travel so when you
[662.92 - 668.32] swallowing it would absorb right into
[665.08 - 671.64] your throat as you were swallowing and
[668.32 - 673.44] it would then absorb into your thyroid
[671.64 - 676.48] and your thyroid will fill up with
[673.44 - 679.32] Arsenic and lead and even some
[676.48 - 683.84] Mercury the Epstein bar virus would
[679.32 - 686.88] adapt and start to search for its food
[683.84 - 689.24] and travel when I mean be food Epstein
[686.88 - 691.24] bar would feed off of Arsenic and
[689.24 - 693.20] remember that it would travel and start
[691.24 - 695.04] to adapt and learn how to adapt in the
[693.20 - 697.92] body and it started mutating back in
[695.04 - 699.84] that day it would travel for that
[697.92 - 701.60] Arsenic and that lead and guess where it
[699.84 - 703.68] would find its way guess where it would
[701.60 - 705.24] go to are you guessing what I'm thinking
[703.68 - 709.12] you are the
[705.24 - 710.88] thyroid and invading the thyroid causing
[709.12 - 712.36] you know what I'm talking about
[710.88 - 715.16] Hashimoto's
[712.36 - 718.04] thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis now
[715.16 - 720.52] this label this condition of Hashimoto
[718.04 - 724.00] thyroiditis was discovered meaning the
[720.52 - 727.96] label was dis was created in
[724.00 - 729.88] 1912 1912 see no one knew what caused
[727.96 - 732.16] Hashimoto thyroiditis they still don't
[729.88 - 735.28] know today I've spent decades trying to
[732.16 - 737.52] teach people that it's caused by epeen
[735.28 - 740.84] bar virus and it's just starting to
[737.52 - 743.44] surface now out there and any place you
[740.84 - 745.48] hear it or see it it originally sources
[743.44 - 748.48] from me I'm just being straightforward
[745.48 - 750.60] about that one that's the bottom line
[748.48 - 752.92] cuz I'm the one that only knew that
[750.60 - 754.88] because of spirit for decades now and
[752.92 - 759.28] been trying to get that information out
[754.88 - 762.08] there so now when Epstein bar virus when
[759.28 - 765.64] the Epstein bar gets into the thyroid
[762.08 - 766.92] this is stage three of Epstein bar so
[765.64 - 769.00] you have to understand this this is
[766.92 - 770.88] stage three of Epstein bar so that means
[769.00 - 771.72] when it entered into somebody's thyroid
[770.88 - 774.28] in
[771.72 - 778.84] 1912 in the early
[774.28 - 780.76] 1900s this was stage three of having
[778.84 - 782.96] Epstein bar now we're going to talk
[780.76 - 784.08] about Epstein bar stages Epstein bar has
[782.96 - 787.04] four
[784.08 - 789.60] stages stage one of Epstein bar is when
[787.04 - 792.44] the virus is in the body but it's in a
[789.60 - 794.68] dormancy incubation period it's
[792.44 - 797.16] incubating it's waiting for an
[794.68 - 799.96] opportunity like when we get really run
[797.16 - 802.52] down or we get deficient or we got
[799.96 - 805.04] stressed out or we're
[802.52 - 807.76] intoxicated with some kind of poisons or
[805.04 - 809.44] whatever it may be or we have emotional
[807.76 - 814.60] hardships
[809.44 - 816.84] and then boom romatic fever occurs yes
[814.60 - 819.40] romatic fever guess what romatic fever
[816.84 - 822.72] is no one realizes it's in the medical
[819.40 - 824.36] industry romatic fever is Epstein bar
[822.72 - 827.36] it's
[824.36 - 830.32] mononucleosis it's a variety of
[827.36 - 832.80] mononucleosis and now it's diagnosis
[830.32 - 837.12] mononucleosis used to be diagnosis
[832.80 - 840.44] romatic fever and it's also diagnosed as
[837.12 - 843.44] glandular fever in fact all the way back
[840.44 - 847.48] back in those days when Epstein bar
[843.44 - 849.88] would hit stage two and turn into
[847.48 - 851.84] mononucleosis it was called glandular
[849.88 - 853.32] fever it's still called glandular fever
[851.84 - 857.00] in different parts of the
[853.32 - 859.88] world the infamous kissing disease were
[857.00 - 864.72] taught about is called glandular fever
[859.88 - 867.44] romatic you know romatic fever and
[864.72 - 870.24] mononucleosis and so this is important
[867.44 - 874.08] to know the virus
[870.24 - 877.44] um once again after that period goes and
[874.08 - 880.52] waits into a dorcy period this could
[877.44 - 882.96] take a month this could take years this
[880.52 - 884.36] could take decades depending on what's
[882.96 - 887.24] going on in the
[884.36 - 889.48] person and it's and this happens before
[887.24 - 891.72] it goes to stage three remember I told
[889.48 - 895.08] you I jumped ahead earlier because I had
[891.72 - 897.84] to because 1912 they discovered
[895.08 - 900.16] thyroiditis Hashimoto thyroiditis is
[897.84 - 902.96] stage three so when the virus comes out
[900.16 - 906.24] of dorcy again which could take a month
[902.96 - 908.24] or a year or a decade or more or two
[906.24 - 910.48] decades or even longer it can turn into
[908.24 - 912.92] hashimotos thyroiditis or
[910.48 - 915.72] hypothyroidism and it depends on so many
[912.92 - 918.08] variables the person's immune system
[915.72 - 920.68] what is happening in their lives I've
[918.08 - 923.16] seen children get mono at age five or
[920.68 - 927.00] six or seven years old and then they get
[923.16 - 929.68] Hashim Modas at 16 years of age 17 years
[927.00 - 932.80] of age or 18 years of age it kashimoto
[929.68 - 935.72] that early that means they had Mono
[932.80 - 938.44] before that this is not understood on
[935.72 - 940.32] any level in our medical field right now
[938.44 - 942.88] so what you're hearing is groundbreaking
[940.32 - 945.56] information that doesn't exist out
[942.88 - 948.80] there but back in the old days in the
[945.56 - 951.40] early 1900s we going back now it
[948.80 - 953.44] normally took longer before there were
[951.40 - 955.20] only because there were only a few
[953.44 - 958.60] varieties of Epstein bar what I mean is
[955.20 - 960.92] it took longer for Hashimoto thought
[958.60 - 964.16] thyroiditis it took longer for the next
[960.92 - 966.20] phase or the next stage of Epstein bar
[964.16 - 969.16] because there were only a few varieties
[966.20 - 971.84] of epin bar in that time which leads me
[969.16 - 974.56] to the next bit of information to
[971.84 - 978.00] understand is there are over 60
[974.56 - 981.64] varieties of Epstein bar today our
[978.00 - 984.84] medical model has no clue about this
[981.64 - 986.60] some are doile some are timid so some
[984.84 - 988.56] varieties of Epstein bar doile some
[986.60 - 990.24] varieties of Epstein bar are timid and
[988.56 - 993.32] some are more
[990.24 - 997.40] aggressive so going back to the old days
[993.32 - 1001.20] early to mid 1900s it took most people
[997.40 - 1003.92] especially women to get to the age of 40
[1001.20 - 1007.64] get to the age of 45 get to the age of
[1003.92 - 1010.32] 50 before they experienced a set of
[1007.64 - 1012.20] symptoms that eluded the medical world
[1010.32 - 1014.76] even up to
[1012.20 - 1017.00] today understand the importance of this
[1014.76 - 1019.20] this is this is amazing if you got
[1017.00 - 1024.32] Epstein bar and you were born around the
[1019.20 - 1028.16] time of 1900 or 1890 or 1895 or
[1024.32 - 1031.08] 1903 and right around the age
[1028.16 - 1034.08] 40 the virus would go into the next set
[1031.08 - 1035.96] of phases right around 40 45 50 years
[1034.08 - 1038.00] old every person was different because
[1035.96 - 1040.00] of different circumstances and different
[1038.00 - 1042.16] situations but at that time there
[1040.00 - 1044.12] weren't a lot of varieties of Epstein
[1042.16 - 1046.60] bar so they were all similar there only
[1044.12 - 1050.56] were a few at that time that mutated at
[1046.60 - 1055.12] that early time so there was a whole
[1050.56 - 1057.72] like crowd a whole vast sea of women
[1055.12 - 1058.60] that experienced epine bar symptoms out
[1057.72 - 1062.12] of
[1058.60 - 1065.80] nowhere turn on the turn of around 1950
[1062.12 - 1069.20] right around 1945 to
[1065.80 - 1071.28] 1950 and it stormed the medical world
[1069.20 - 1074.32] these symptoms that all the women were
[1071.28 - 1076.24] faced with and these might be familiar
[1074.32 - 1078.60] okay so you know match them up TI yours
[1076.24 - 1081.28] if you want to that's you know it's
[1078.60 - 1083.64] important to know this is important but
[1081.28 - 1086.40] the symptoms were the next phase of
[1083.64 - 1089.84] epine bar which is called stage four
[1086.40 - 1091.04] Epstein bar that's what this is so that
[1089.84 - 1093.36] that's what all these symptoms were
[1091.04 - 1096.08] about to go into it's stage four Epstein
[1093.36 - 1098.12] bar so it took a long time for these few
[1096.08 - 1101.04] varieties of Epstein bar for women to
[1098.12 - 1103.16] get you know that were born at 1900 or
[1101.04 - 1105.44] like I said 1895 and by the time they
[1103.16 - 1107.40] turned 40 45 50 years old they had
[1105.44 - 1108.88] tingles and numbness do you know about
[1107.40 - 1112.00] the tingles and numbness
[1108.88 - 1115.48] they had aches and pains joint
[1112.00 - 1119.40] swelling vertigo and
[1115.48 - 1123.88] dizziness tentis ringing in the ears
[1119.40 - 1125.92] buzzing in the ears hot flashes yeah hot
[1123.88 - 1127.44] flashes that's important to understand
[1125.92 - 1129.72] because we're about to cover that next
[1127.44 - 1131.64] heart palpitations are you getting heart
[1129.72 - 1133.84] palpitations night
[1131.64 - 1135.52] sweats brain
[1133.84 - 1137.32] fog
[1135.52 - 1140.92] depression
[1137.32 - 1143.40] anxiety burning feelings burning you
[1140.92 - 1146.36] know pins and needles or burning in
[1143.40 - 1148.88] various parts of the body which we call
[1146.36 - 1150.32] neuropathy now which is another kind of
[1148.88 - 1152.08] like hey we don't know what's wrong with
[1150.32 - 1157.68] anybody but let's put another label to
[1152.08 - 1160.08] it blurry eyes migraines loss of
[1157.68 - 1161.60] libido head pains in the back of the
[1160.08 - 1165.68] neck back of the
[1161.60 - 1169.44] head weight gain unexplained weight gain
[1165.68 - 1171.64] edema swelling and edema lymph Pema
[1169.44 - 1173.52] swelling ankles unexplained swelling
[1171.64 - 1174.76] knees when you get hit the knees get hit
[1173.52 - 1178.36] and they swell too long and they stay
[1174.76 - 1180.92] swollen for years vibrating feelings
[1178.36 - 1184.84] inside the body
[1180.92 - 1187.80] confusion roving and moving body pain
[1184.84 - 1191.56] see by 1950 women were feeling the first
[1187.80 - 1193.12] round of stage four Epstein bar symptoms
[1191.56 - 1196.08] ever in
[1193.12 - 1198.24] history ever in history and no one's
[1196.08 - 1200.24] talking about it no one's talking about
[1198.24 - 1202.72] about it but right here at this show and
[1200.24 - 1204.88] this is why you have to stay tuned in to
[1202.72 - 1207.16] these show shows because I got to pour
[1204.88 - 1209.44] my heart out I to give you everything I
[1207.16 - 1211.64] got so you have a chance to take the
[1209.44 - 1213.68] information heal you know spread the
[1211.64 - 1215.04] information around because it's so
[1213.68 - 1218.76] critical to
[1215.04 - 1220.36] know and women were told at that in this
[1218.76 - 1222.64] time period that it was all in their
[1220.36 - 1224.68] heads and they were told they were crazy
[1222.64 - 1227.84] this was the moment in time right around
[1224.68 - 1230.40] the 1945 1950 period when this wave of
[1227.84 - 1234.28] symptoms from Epstein bar crashed the
[1230.40 - 1237.00] scene women were told by every single
[1234.28 - 1239.56] Medical Institution there was that they
[1237.00 - 1242.00] were lazy that their fatigue was because
[1239.56 - 1243.44] they were lazy because they were bored
[1242.00 - 1245.40] because they were crazy they even
[1243.44 - 1247.64] entered it into some medical medical
[1245.40 - 1249.88] books where they called it crazy women's
[1247.64 - 1252.44] syndrome that's how they dealt with it
[1249.88 - 1254.40] and that lasted that's still kind of
[1252.44 - 1257.88] floating around a little bit it's it's
[1254.40 - 1260.80] died out cuz we put labels now on sets
[1257.88 - 1264.44] of symptoms so the so before these
[1260.80 - 1266.52] labels all these new labels came about
[1264.44 - 1270.44] before that started happening in the in
[1266.52 - 1273.24] the 19 late 1980s yes in the late 1980s
[1270.44 - 1275.92] it took that long in the 1990s before we
[1273.24 - 1278.28] started getting actually names for these
[1275.92 - 1279.40] conditions you were just insane that's
[1278.28 - 1280.60] what happened when you had all the
[1279.40 - 1282.36] symptoms I mentioned when you were
[1280.60 - 1284.56] fatigued had tingles and numbness
[1282.36 - 1286.76] vertigo dizziness ringing in the ears
[1284.56 - 1289.04] hot flashes heart potations brain fog
[1286.76 - 1291.28] depression anxiety burning in various
[1289.04 - 1294.00] parts of the body blurry eyes migraines
[1291.28 - 1296.76] aches and pain swelling these are all
[1294.00 - 1300.32] stage four symptoms of Epstein bar and
[1296.76 - 1304.08] we were told we were insane at that time
[1300.32 - 1307.28] period okay the the push back occurred
[1304.08 - 1310.32] women had enough at that point hitting
[1307.28 - 1313.32] in the mid-50s after five to seven years
[1310.32 - 1315.08] to the late 50s women had enough and the
[1313.32 - 1318.24] push back was just
[1315.08 - 1320.92] enormous and basically what happened
[1318.24 - 1322.88] after that these symptoms of the medical
[1320.92 - 1324.44] field that they all the symptoms that
[1322.88 - 1327.04] women were experiencing the medical
[1324.44 - 1329.68] field put a big blame on one thing you
[1327.04 - 1331.36] know what I'm talking about someone out
[1329.68 - 1333.92] there knows what I'm talking about that
[1331.36 - 1336.60] was the birth of the hormone movement
[1333.92 - 1338.68] that was when it was all hormonal it's
[1336.60 - 1341.24] actually hormones and they were still
[1338.68 - 1342.84] saying you're still crazy to have these
[1341.24 - 1344.04] symptoms because there's nothing wrong
[1342.84 - 1346.52] with you know everybody they were
[1344.04 - 1348.12] looking at so when they were doing you
[1346.52 - 1349.20] know physical exams they're like who
[1348.12 - 1350.76] nothing wrong with you we don't know why
[1349.20 - 1353.44] you have tingles and numbness so you're
[1350.76 - 1355.44] either crazy or it's hormonal we still
[1353.44 - 1358.32] get that today where we're told it's
[1355.44 - 1361.88] hormonal now to and that's what's
[1358.32 - 1364.72] happening and so hormones the hormone
[1361.88 - 1367.36] movement their hormone replacement era
[1364.72 - 1369.60] was born in the late 50s because of
[1367.36 - 1373.00] stage four Epstein
[1369.60 - 1376.04] bar women didn't suffer from the
[1373.00 - 1378.40] symptoms ever before in the past ever
[1376.04 - 1380.92] anytime they hit menopause ever in
[1378.40 - 1385.12] history were they suffering from these
[1380.92 - 1387.48] symptoms it wasn't n it was never there
[1385.12 - 1390.68] because it was never was never hormonal
[1387.48 - 1394.44] see it was abstein bar stage four now
[1390.68 - 1397.16] decades later women of all ages get the
[1394.44 - 1399.32] symptoms get all the symptoms I just
[1397.16 - 1400.76] mentioned so when they're younger
[1399.32 - 1403.96] they're not told it's
[1400.76 - 1406.72] hormones they but they're starting to
[1403.96 - 1408.36] now because still to this day people
[1406.72 - 1410.08] don't know why we're getting these
[1408.36 - 1411.68] symptomss so they're still kind of
[1410.08 - 1413.00] saying well now you're 30 years old
[1411.68 - 1414.76] maybe you have hormonal problems and
[1413.00 - 1417.04] maybe that's creating all these symptoms
[1414.76 - 1419.64] of fatigue all these symptoms of brain
[1417.04 - 1421.68] fog blurry eyes you know everything uh
[1419.64 - 1424.24] heart palpitations tingles and numbness
[1421.68 - 1426.44] so even younger women and men some men
[1424.24 - 1428.40] are being told it's it's a hormone
[1426.44 - 1430.36] problem and if that's not good enough
[1428.40 - 1431.92] then it's off to the Lyme disease doctor
[1430.36 - 1433.52] you can listen to my lyme disease show
[1431.92 - 1434.52] if you want a little taste of the whole
[1433.52 - 1438.00] lime
[1434.52 - 1440.80] truth and so that's what's happening to
[1438.00 - 1443.24] today now we'll go back a little bit now
[1440.80 - 1446.08] now now back by
[1443.24 - 1448.24] 1964 two brilliant biologists discovered
[1446.08 - 1451.32] a virus that was responsible for
[1448.24 - 1453.84] mononucleosis romatic fever but
[1451.32 - 1457.16] mononucleosis glandular fever and they
[1453.84 - 1459.96] singled it out and named it Epstein bar
[1457.16 - 1462.72] virus after the doctors and that was an
[1459.96 - 1464.60] amazing Discovery it really was and that
[1462.72 - 1466.72] goes to show you what we can do with the
[1464.60 - 1469.48] doctors that are out there the problem
[1466.72 - 1472.56] is the funding dropped and that was the
[1469.48 - 1475.88] bottom line funding was over it's a dead
[1472.56 - 1477.68] topic see you later and that's what
[1475.88 - 1479.48] happens in chronic illness though that's
[1477.68 - 1482.16] the whole point that's what happens all
[1479.48 - 1484.48] the time now what medical research and
[1482.16 - 1486.44] science has done to acknowledge Epstein
[1484.48 - 1488.96] bar symptoms meaning without knowing
[1486.44 - 1491.52] Epstein bar causes any of these symptoms
[1488.96 - 1493.36] is they put labels now on these sets of
[1491.52 - 1495.68] symptoms so the medical world doesn't
[1493.36 - 1497.96] realize that this is Epstein bar related
[1495.68 - 1501.40] but they put names on sets of symptoms
[1497.96 - 1503.48] now that everybody has and that's
[1501.40 - 1504.60] fibromyalgia what what causes it h
[1503.48 - 1507.92] nobody
[1504.60 - 1511.36] knows but it's Epstein bar that's stage
[1507.92 - 1512.84] four Epstein bar multiple sceris still
[1511.36 - 1516.20] don't know the cause it's a mystery
[1512.84 - 1518.60] illness Epstein bar different varieties
[1516.20 - 1521.28] of Epstein bar cause cause and mass now
[1518.60 - 1524.60] there's over 60 varieties like I said
[1521.28 - 1529.44] chronic fatigue syndrome which has
[1524.60 - 1532.48] various names now such as and me CFS
[1529.44 - 1534.72] okay also systemic exertion intolerance
[1532.48 - 1537.60] disease these are still just a way of
[1534.72 - 1541.08] saying yes you're tiredness is real so
[1537.60 - 1543.84] thank God we have labels at least to say
[1541.08 - 1546.52] hey your symptoms are real but we're
[1543.84 - 1549.40] nowhere closer to understanding what's
[1546.52 - 1551.52] causing this and knowing that it's over
[1549.40 - 1555.16] 60 varieties of epsteam bar causing
[1551.52 - 1556.68] these sets of these labels these sets of
[1555.16 - 1560.60] symptoms
[1556.68 - 1563.24] so and it goes on past then ra RTI
[1560.60 - 1566.24] arthritis that's another one so you know
[1563.24 - 1568.12] when children get ra it's stage 4 fste
[1566.24 - 1571.00] bar but early
[1568.12 - 1572.44] on early on in their lives because
[1571.00 - 1573.92] there's different varieties they've
[1572.44 - 1576.00] mutated and they become a little bit
[1573.92 - 1579.20] more aggressive and kids get different
[1576.00 - 1582.20] stages early on doesn't mean everybody
[1579.20 - 1583.36] can't heal anyone can heal and there's
[1582.20 - 1584.68] ways of doing about it we're going to
[1583.36 - 1587.80] get to that don't worry we're going to
[1584.68 - 1590.08] get to that menopause that's a label see
[1587.80 - 1592.96] menopause really is just supposed to be
[1590.08 - 1594.36] menstration stopping the cycle stopping
[1592.96 - 1598.92] that's all it's supposed to be in fact
[1594.36 - 1601.28] before 1950 women felt great after their
[1598.92 - 1604.64] cycle stopped they felt great it was
[1601.28 - 1606.56] looked forward to in history meaning in
[1604.64 - 1608.28] P in the past women look forward to that
[1606.56 - 1610.80] stopping it meant they felt better more
[1608.28 - 1611.80] energy than ever before no symptoms
[1610.80 - 1615.48] would
[1611.80 - 1617.08] occur and but now we label your set of
[1615.48 - 1618.20] symptoms everybody sets of symptoms as
[1617.08 - 1620.60] menopause
[1618.20 - 1622.32] depression we use that label too when
[1620.60 - 1625.04] we're depressed instead of knowing the
[1622.32 - 1629.20] root cause of someone's depression we
[1625.04 - 1632.60] throw label anxiety lupus that's caused
[1629.20 - 1635.44] by Epstein bar and that's another one
[1632.60 - 1637.36] and of course many cases of Lyme disease
[1635.44 - 1639.36] these labeled conditions plus many more
[1637.36 - 1642.08] are caused by over 60 varieties of
[1639.36 - 1644.88] Epstein bar and in different stages of
[1642.08 - 1647.24] the virus including Hashimoto
[1644.88 - 1651.64] thyroiditis like we talked about before
[1647.24 - 1654.68] he hepatitus C is not a hepatitis virus
[1651.64 - 1657.80] it's a condition of the liver caused by
[1654.68 - 1660.08] a variety of Epstein bar there they
[1657.80 - 1662.48] still don't know this and medical
[1660.08 - 1664.36] history Medical Research Medical Science
[1662.48 - 1667.80] isn't even caught up to that you know I
[1664.36 - 1669.60] always say I'm going to die come back in
[1667.80 - 1671.68] another lifetime they're still not going
[1669.60 - 1673.76] to know die One More Time come back in
[1671.68 - 1676.40] another lifetime and it's possible they
[1673.76 - 1679.12] still won't know you know and it's it's
[1676.40 - 1682.20] nobody's fault it's nobody's fault but
[1679.12 - 1685.76] that's the slowness of it all that's the
[1682.20 - 1687.16] slowness of of everything so hepatitis C
[1685.76 - 1689.36] is caused by Epstein bar that's
[1687.16 - 1691.32] different than Hepatitis B hepatitis C
[1689.36 - 1694.44] is is Epstein bar
[1691.32 - 1696.56] glaucoma you know the eye illness the
[1694.44 - 1698.64] eye condition glaucoma that's caused by
[1696.56 - 1700.84] a variety of epine bar and certain
[1698.64 - 1702.72] cancer specifically breast cancer is
[1700.84 - 1705.96] caused by ep bar
[1702.72 - 1708.40] viruses so all this is important to know
[1705.96 - 1712.32] this is part of the epid mic we live in
[1708.40 - 1715.04] today now it it does matter to know this
[1712.32 - 1717.52] information it's not because you know
[1715.04 - 1719.88] knowing it makes things more scary
[1717.52 - 1722.28] that's not it at all you gain control
[1719.88 - 1724.48] knowing the truth you don't want the
[1722.28 - 1726.44] truth avoided or you don't want it
[1724.48 - 1729.32] hidden away you don't want it being a
[1726.44 - 1732.64] mystery because that's when all this
[1729.32 - 1734.84] stuff is tougher on us is when it's a
[1732.64 - 1737.04] mystery and nobody knows and we're never
[1734.84 - 1739.92] getting validation and we're going to Dr
[1737.04 - 1741.84] doctor you get 50 doctors going to
[1739.92 - 1743.48] different people and you're traveling
[1741.84 - 1745.36] across country you're spending hundreds
[1743.48 - 1747.48] of thousands of dollars that's more
[1745.36 - 1750.56] damaging than knowing the truth and
[1747.48 - 1752.36] knowing how to recover and heal you see
[1750.56 - 1755.44] that's that's how it
[1752.36 - 1759.12] works see you don't have to there's a
[1755.44 - 1762.08] couple of things to know you don't have
[1759.12 - 1764.36] to remember having mono in order to have
[1762.08 - 1766.76] Epstein bar in the system some people
[1764.36 - 1768.72] have bad cases of mononucleosis so they
[1766.76 - 1770.24] remember it specifically but some people
[1768.72 - 1771.52] have had a sore throat and a scratchy
[1770.24 - 1774.00] throat for a week and that's all they
[1771.52 - 1776.44] had and it went away it went into a
[1774.00 - 1778.36] dormancy so let talk about Epstein bar
[1776.44 - 1779.96] testing when you go to the doctor and
[1778.36 - 1782.28] you get tested for Epstein bar they only
[1779.96 - 1783.96] care about present infection which is
[1782.28 - 1784.96] mononucleosis they only care about
[1783.96 - 1787.64] present
[1784.96 - 1789.24] infection now what the medical research
[1787.64 - 1791.76] and medical science and doctors don't
[1789.24 - 1793.72] know right now is that past infection
[1791.76 - 1796.52] Epstein bar meaning knowing that you had
[1793.72 - 1798.40] it in the past still means it could be
[1796.52 - 1800.88] doing something and creating your
[1798.40 - 1802.60] symptoms so it's completely ignored so
[1800.88 - 1804.48] when you go to the doctor and you say I
[1802.60 - 1805.92] got this problem and I got this and I
[1804.48 - 1808.04] you know I got tingles and I got
[1805.92 - 1810.72] twitches and I got all these you know
[1808.04 - 1812.56] different things going on and I got um
[1810.72 - 1814.80] you know and I got fatigue and I can't
[1812.56 - 1816.36] function and they do a test and they say
[1814.80 - 1817.84] everything looks okay it looks like you
[1816.36 - 1819.56] had Epstein bar but that shouldn't be
[1817.84 - 1822.00] your problem because you don't have it
[1819.56 - 1824.12] now that's not true they haven't
[1822.00 - 1826.40] developed the proper testing to see that
[1824.12 - 1828.60] it's in the organs and then it's also
[1826.40 - 1831.32] affecting the nervous system they don't
[1828.60 - 1832.92] have this technology yet we still don't
[1831.32 - 1835.68] have a lot of technology in chronic
[1832.92 - 1837.80] illness how do I know that there's 200
[1835.68 - 1839.88] million sick people in the US alone with
[1837.80 - 1842.48] symptoms that are mystery illness that's
[1839.88 - 1845.48] how I know that we don't have the
[1842.48 - 1847.48] technology or the understanding yet you
[1845.48 - 1850.52] know this is you know I'm passionate
[1847.48 - 1852.28] about this because this is about
[1850.52 - 1854.28] everything about you getting better it
[1852.28 - 1856.20] means the world so when you have stage
[1854.28 - 1859.28] four Epstein bar and all the symptoms
[1856.20 - 1861.40] around it the doctor can't find Epstein
[1859.28 - 1863.32] bar actively in the bloodstream so they
[1861.40 - 1865.92] dismiss it it's one of the mistakes this
[1863.32 - 1867.12] is one of the greatest medical blunders
[1865.92 - 1869.28] of our
[1867.12 - 1871.96] time we'll talk about some of the
[1869.28 - 1875.24] symptoms of Epstein bar Epstein bar is
[1871.96 - 1878.08] herpetic so it's in the herpes family
[1875.24 - 1881.00] this is the one family the only family
[1878.08 - 1883.68] of bugs that release a
[1881.00 - 1887.04] neurotoxin that aggravates the nervous
[1883.68 - 1890.24] system causing tingles and numbness see
[1887.04 - 1892.60] the neurotoxin is basically an excrement
[1890.24 - 1894.68] that comes out of the virus after the
[1892.60 - 1897.36] virus feeds off of heavy metals feeds
[1894.68 - 1899.24] off of foods like eggs like I talk about
[1897.36 - 1901.00] if you're if you're someone who's not
[1899.24 - 1902.40] feeling good and you got all kinds of
[1901.00 - 1905.40] different symptoms make sure you're not
[1902.40 - 1906.72] eating eggs because eggs will feed a bug
[1905.40 - 1910.44] like Epstein
[1906.72 - 1912.80] bar so this neurotoxin can create a lot
[1910.44 - 1914.40] of different symptoms can create tingles
[1912.80 - 1916.88] and numbness and many other different
[1914.40 - 1920.36] symptoms around that brain fog can
[1916.88 - 1923.04] create um aches and pains and so this
[1920.36 - 1924.28] neurotoxin also creates food allergies
[1923.04 - 1925.96] people say well how can I have a food
[1924.28 - 1928.00] allergy now how could that have happened
[1925.96 - 1930.32] I never had it before why am I
[1928.00 - 1932.76] developing food allergy I went to the
[1930.32 - 1934.68] doctor to the you know the integrative
[1932.76 - 1936.32] doctor I went to the functional medicine
[1934.68 - 1939.36] doctor I got all these food allergies
[1936.32 - 1943.24] and sensitivities now that's from having
[1939.36 - 1945.96] a higher debris of this byproduct these
[1943.24 - 1948.12] neurotoxins from Epstein bar it creates
[1945.96 - 1950.52] chemical sensitivity
[1948.12 - 1952.80] it creates food at food sensitivities
[1950.52 - 1954.96] epine bar creates a lot of byproduct and
[1952.80 - 1957.44] debris and garbage and this builds up in
[1954.96 - 1961.08] the liver causes a stagnant sluggish
[1957.44 - 1963.12] liver and gets the heart to even have a
[1961.08 - 1965.04] heart palpitation because all that
[1963.12 - 1967.40] byproduct from the liver goes up to the
[1965.04 - 1969.00] heart and trips up the mitro valve
[1967.40 - 1971.48] creating heart palpitations these These
[1969.00 - 1974.36] are the mystery H heart palps that no
[1971.48 - 1976.08] one understands out there and it's the
[1974.36 - 1978.48] sticky residue that builds up in the
[1976.08 - 1981.76] mitro valve this is from the byproduct
[1978.48 - 1985.56] EBV Epstein bar raises inflammation
[1981.76 - 1987.76] markers with this byproduct it produces
[1985.56 - 1990.60] it raises inflammation markers causing
[1987.76 - 1993.48] the CRP so when you get the CRP C
[1990.60 - 1995.96] reactive protein test and it's showing
[1993.48 - 1997.96] that you you got an elevation no one
[1995.96 - 1999.60] realizes it it's from byproduct from
[1997.96 - 2003.40] Epstein bar same thing with the
[1999.60 - 2005.28] anti-nuclear antigen test the Ana test
[2003.40 - 2007.56] this is inflammation
[2005.28 - 2010.32] levels that rise
[2007.56 - 2012.20] because of toxins released in
[2010.32 - 2013.80] neurotoxins and byproduct from Epstein
[2012.20 - 2016.84] bar so guess what you end up getting a
[2013.80 - 2019.64] lupus diagnosis that's how far off we
[2016.84 - 2022.44] are we're that far off in
[2019.64 - 2025.16] medicine we're that far off so we get
[2022.44 - 2026.84] the whole lupus thing and and that's
[2025.16 - 2027.80] because someone's getting sensitive and
[2026.84 - 2028.96] they're getting the chemical
[2027.80 - 2031.00] sensitivities and they're getting all
[2028.96 - 2033.44] the symptoms based around it this
[2031.00 - 2035.76] byproduct raises homocysteine levels
[2033.44 - 2037.76] were you told you have an MTHFR gene
[2035.76 - 2039.28] mutation at all so when you go to the
[2037.76 - 2040.88] practitioner and you're told you know
[2039.28 - 2042.36] you're having that gene mutation some
[2040.88 - 2044.44] people have three mutations some people
[2042.36 - 2046.80] have you know four mutations two M
[2044.44 - 2050.16] mutations right so when you that's
[2046.80 - 2052.00] because of epine bar byproduct it's from
[2050.16 - 2055.64] having Epstein bar in the system for a
[2052.00 - 2057.44] long time in your life and it builds up
[2055.64 - 2059.80] a tremendous amount of byproduct and
[2057.44 - 2061.64] excrement releases all these toxins
[2059.80 - 2065.88] including neurotoxins so it raises
[2061.64 - 2068.96] homine levels and it sets off the faulty
[2065.88 - 2071.80] MTHFR gene mutation
[2068.96 - 2075.00] test and creates a but it does create a
[2071.80 - 2076.52] true methylation issue at the same time
[2075.00 - 2079.16] so there is a methylation issue that
[2076.52 - 2080.64] that does occur from having Epstein bar
[2079.16 - 2082.80] so there's like they're almost there
[2080.64 - 2084.68] with that one Epstein bar can make a
[2082.80 - 2087.88] liver really sluggish causing weak
[2084.68 - 2091.64] digestion and breaking down hydrochloric
[2087.88 - 2094.92] acid and Epstein bar can can trigger off
[2091.64 - 2098.36] false positives on a lime test that's
[2094.92 - 2100.36] when your lime test comes back
[2098.36 - 2102.16] borderline why is it borderline you
[2100.36 - 2104.04] either have lime or you don't you can go
[2102.16 - 2106.16] you can listen to the lime show on that
[2104.04 - 2108.44] for sure cuz I can't go into lime like
[2106.16 - 2110.68] crazy into lime right now and deep into
[2108.44 - 2112.24] it but it can trigger off your lime
[2110.68 - 2114.96] tighters for everything it could
[2112.24 - 2117.92] literally mask as bartella babesia
[2114.96 - 2121.12] bellia that's what Epstein has the power
[2117.92 - 2123.20] to do not in everybody depending on how
[2121.12 - 2124.60] long you've had it what variety you have
[2123.20 - 2126.24] so it's important to understand these
[2124.60 - 2128.08] things and and anyone listening to this
[2126.24 - 2130.16] I'm not saying Bella doesn't exist I'm
[2128.08 - 2133.32] not saying lime you know bacteria such
[2130.16 - 2135.52] as B you know bellia you know babesia
[2133.32 - 2137.16] parasite babesia doesn't exist I'm not
[2135.52 - 2139.20] saying that so you you know don't get
[2137.16 - 2141.84] thrown by this right now if you if this
[2139.20 - 2145.16] the first time hearing one of my shows
[2141.84 - 2147.12] but evv upsteam bar is responsible for
[2145.16 - 2149.88] hundreds of thousands of people's
[2147.12 - 2151.68] tonsils coming out you know the whole
[2149.88 - 2155.00] tonsil thing when they're plucking them
[2151.68 - 2157.20] like apples forever back in the ' 50s
[2155.00 - 2160.24] and the' 60s the 70s and we're still
[2157.20 - 2164.04] plucking them out that's from mono
[2160.24 - 2166.00] undiagnosed mono because mono is elusive
[2164.04 - 2168.28] you can have mononucleosis Epstein bar
[2166.00 - 2172.28] is elusive you can have it once early on
[2168.28 - 2172.28] in your childhood they won't rediagnosis
[2175.80 - 2181.52] it's another thing it does so they're
[2178.96 - 2184.16] just pulling tonsils out for decades
[2181.52 - 2187.68] without realizing what's creating
[2184.16 - 2191.04] tonsilitis see how important the show is
[2187.68 - 2192.56] this episode I mean it's really that
[2191.04 - 2195.44] important
[2192.56 - 2197.52] and you know fste bar tends to create
[2195.44 - 2200.88] problems with soreness aches and pains
[2197.52 - 2202.12] fatigue after the body gets jolted so I
[2200.88 - 2204.76] you know lots of people they get into
[2202.12 - 2207.40] small car accidents or they have a they
[2204.76 - 2209.96] have some trauma and they and and their
[2207.40 - 2212.40] body is physically fine after or they
[2209.96 - 2214.84] recover from the trauma part but yet
[2212.40 - 2217.40] they have new aches and pains that are
[2214.84 - 2220.00] unexplainable by doctors and in by
[2217.40 - 2221.68] medical research and Science and you
[2220.00 - 2223.44] start getting fibromyalgia and you start
[2221.68 - 2227.76] getting inflamed this is from Epstein
[2223.44 - 2229.88] bar ttis ringing in the ears is caused
[2227.76 - 2234.08] by the Labyrinth of the inside of the
[2229.88 - 2236.12] ear getting inflamed by epine bars
[2234.08 - 2237.28] neurotoxins you go to an ear nose and
[2236.12 - 2239.56] throat doctor they're not going to
[2237.28 - 2241.80] figure that one out that's going to take
[2239.56 - 2243.28] 30 years from now it's caused by a
[2241.80 - 2245.68] neurotoxin That's What Causes That
[2243.28 - 2248.36] ringing in the air unless you damage
[2245.68 - 2250.44] your nerve your nerve in the ear by
[2248.36 - 2251.88] listening to you know concerts rock
[2250.44 - 2253.68] concerts your whole life or something
[2251.88 - 2256.16] crazy like that you worked in a machine
[2253.68 - 2259.24] shop or something and that's a little
[2256.16 - 2261.12] different but this is this is the common
[2259.24 - 2263.52] ringing in the ears caused by Epstein
[2261.12 - 2266.28] bar I was saying previously dizziness
[2263.52 - 2267.76] vertigo that's the Vagas nerve that runs
[2266.28 - 2270.52] through the chest that makes the chest
[2267.76 - 2273.76] feel tight that Vagas nerve gets
[2270.52 - 2275.96] inflamed by neurotoxins from Epstein bar
[2273.76 - 2278.68] causing vertigo bouts of vertigo bed
[2275.96 - 2282.12] spins head head spins dizziness balance
[2278.68 - 2284.56] issues that are unexplainable by the
[2282.12 - 2287.28] medical world when you go to the doctor
[2284.56 - 2289.28] this is caused by Epstein Barb then
[2287.28 - 2291.64] there's headaches back of the head neck
[2289.28 - 2295.20] AES back of the neck caused by frenic
[2291.64 - 2297.08] nerves frenic nerves that run up through
[2295.20 - 2299.48] the chest up through the neck they get
[2297.08 - 2302.40] inflamed from the neurotoxin Epstein
[2299.48 - 2304.44] bar epin bar has a friend in crime
[2302.40 - 2306.40] called strep acacus it's a bacteria
[2304.44 - 2308.44] strep that's when you get strep throat
[2306.40 - 2311.08] that that's when you have strep that's
[2308.44 - 2313.32] when women are about to have a baby so
[2311.08 - 2316.44] the doctor checks for vaginal strep the
[2313.32 - 2320.20] strep is everywhere in our bodies it's a
[2316.44 - 2323.08] co-actor to Epstein bar causes a lot of
[2320.20 - 2326.28] the bladder problems strep aacle is
[2323.08 - 2329.00] responsible for intercal cystitis which
[2326.28 - 2332.32] is technically kind of caused by Epstein
[2329.00 - 2335.16] bar because it's its co-actor so that
[2332.32 - 2337.12] that alone has to be uncovered someday
[2335.16 - 2340.64] and you're only going to hear it here

[2487.64 - 2492.24] which feed Epstein bar so you want
[2489.80 - 2494.40] cilantro in all the time you have to
[2492.24 - 2495.96] remember hey look if if it's been a week
[2494.40 - 2498.20] since you've had cilantro that's not
[2495.96 - 2500.12] going to help that's not going to help
[2498.20 - 2501.88] so you have to know that this you have
[2500.12 - 2503.20] to at least do some of these things you
[2501.88 - 2504.92] know you don't have to do all of them
[2503.20 - 2507.40] it's life is overwhelming there's a lot

[2512.72 - 2517.76] which robs food away from Epstein bar
[2515.04 - 2520.72] that's how you heal parsley that's
[2517.76 - 2522.96] another one that robs metal from Epstein
[2520.72 - 2526.12] bar it does remove some metal but it
[2522.96 - 2528.52] also pushes out Epstein bar toxins
[2526.12 - 2532.36] raspberries helps restore the nervous
[2528.52 - 2535.08] system which is a result of Epstein bar
[2532.36 - 2536.84] fennel that's another one fennel juice
[2535.08 - 2539.08] you take the bulbs and you juice them
[2536.84 - 2542.08] that helps clean up clean epine bar of
[2539.08 - 2544.28] the system Ginger is another one
[2542.08 - 2547.44] supplements to kill off and lower the
[2544.28 - 2551.04] load knock the viral load over time
[2547.44 - 2553.36] silver hydrol so silver hydrol you know
[2551.04 - 2554.96] you get the best one on the market and
[2553.36 - 2558.44] you take a little bit a little bit at a
[2554.96 - 2561.04] time that's a great one zinc having
[2558.44 - 2563.92] enough zinc the reason why Epstein bar
[2561.04 - 2566.76] has done so much damage to begin with is
[2563.92 - 2569.84] because most of us have a severe zinc
[2566.76 - 2571.96] deficiency there's no zinc left barely
[2569.84 - 2574.40] left in food anymore it's been like this
[2571.96 - 2575.92] for a century and this is another reason
[2574.40 - 2578.20] why Epstein bar is kind of grabbing a
[2575.92 - 2580.20] whole hold you build your zinc reserves
[2578.20 - 2582.56] reserves up long term and you're going
[2580.20 - 2584.24] to be in a better place B12 especially
[2582.56 - 2587.12] the one I talk about the adino silk
[2584.24 - 2589.76] balamin that B12 restores nervous
[2587.12 - 2593.00] systems so you lose your symptoms
[2589.76 - 2595.96] resulted from Epstein bar lemon bomb

[2598.64 - 2604.96] EBV out selenium protects the nervous
[2601.32 - 2607.36] system sparina helps pull Metals away
[2604.96 - 2610.64] from Epstein bar and it's
[2607.36 - 2614.80] antiviral red Marine algae that's a
[2610.64 - 2618.36] powerful antiviral too kills off EBV
[2614.80 - 2621.20] Epstein bar monol Lauren breaks down
[2618.36 - 2624.20] Epstein bar breaks it down pushes it out
[2621.20 - 2627.04] of the body very important
[2624.20 - 2629.20] Eline Eline someone may say well I've
[2627.04 - 2630.64] taken Eline before now you have to take
[2629.20 - 2632.32] it you have to take a decent amount of
[2630.64 - 2633.72] it what I suggest is you you know you
[2632.32 - 2635.08] you take the supplements I'm talking
[2633.72 - 2637.28] about meaning you take them to your
[2635.08 - 2639.64] practitioner you take them to your
[2637.28 - 2640.88] doctor I take everything I'm saying you
[2639.64 - 2642.04] can take it to your practitioner you can
[2640.88 - 2644.76] take it to your healer you can take it
[2642.04 - 2646.24] to your doctor and say you know I want
[2644.76 - 2648.08] to take this or that and you have your
[2646.24 - 2649.76] you have your your doctor your your
[2648.08 - 2652.28] naturopath or your functional medicine
[2649.76 - 2654.56] doctor plug plug the wires in and put
[2652.28 - 2657.44] the light bulb on top and just and get
[2654.56 - 2659.76] get active with you and start helping
[2657.44 - 2662.44] because if you're on enough Li scene the
[2659.76 - 2665.28] differences occur licorice root licorice
[2662.44 - 2667.48] root tea or highquality licorice root
[2665.28 - 2669.36] products in incredible for knocking down
[2667.48 - 2672.04] Epstein bar but a lot of people are
[2669.36 - 2673.72] afraid of uh licorice because of certain
[2672.04 - 2675.56] things you know there's meaning because
[2673.72 - 2679.40] of rumors or something it's another
[2675.56 - 2681.52] thing too is is losing fear over some of
[2679.40 - 2683.92] the things some of the rumors or the
[2681.52 - 2688.56] myths or the the fads and trends that
[2683.92 - 2691.16] kind of go in the wrong direction 5 mthf
[2688.56 - 2695.36] methylfolate that one's a great one for
[2691.16 - 2697.40] Epstein bar and vitamin C vitamin C
[2695.36 - 2699.52] every sing single day you know the
[2697.40 - 2702.00] highest quality vitamin C you can find
[2699.52 - 2705.08] can talk to your practitioner you know
[2702.00 - 2706.92] that's important or you know or or just
[2705.08 - 2709.16] you may have a vitamin C you already
[2706.92 - 2712.80] you're already comfortable with and you
[2709.16 - 2715.80] use it it just breaks apart Epstein bar
[2712.80 - 2717.60] and pushes it out of the system now some
[2715.80 - 2719.68] people say well wait a minute can
[2717.60 - 2721.84] Epstein bar really go away can we do
[2719.68 - 2725.00] something about it does it go away it
[2721.84 - 2728.52] can can we heal can you kill off epine
[2725.00 - 2733.12] bar you can kill off 90% of it and
[2728.52 - 2734.76] regain your life and leave some in and
[2733.12 - 2737.36] this is interesting you don't want it
[2734.76 - 2739.24] all gone you want a little bit left it
[2737.36 - 2741.36] prevents you from getting another
[2739.24 - 2743.44] variety of Epstein bar it prevents you
[2741.36 - 2745.24] from Catching another variety of
[2743.44 - 2747.92] mononucleosis caused by a different
[2745.24 - 2751.20] variety of Epstein bar so having a
[2747.92 - 2754.36] little bit of your own in is not a bad
[2751.20 - 2756.52] thing it is a good thing but you want to
[2754.36 - 2758.16] knock down as much as you can and you
[2756.52 - 2760.84] gain your life and you gain control and
[2758.16 - 2763.84] you get your life back and you can with
[2760.84 - 2766.44] Epstein bar I've watched it I've seen it
[2763.84 - 2769.72] I've seen hundreds do it I have people
[2766.44 - 2772.56] here lived 30 years now completely free
[2769.72 - 2774.76] from every symptom I mentioned and
[2772.56 - 2777.36] they're in their their 70s they're in
[2774.76 - 2779.08] their 80s I have people in that
[2777.36 - 2781.44] condition where they're like gardening
[2779.08 - 2783.36] every day they're exercising they do
[2781.44 - 2787.48] what they want and they were tragically
[2783.36 - 2790.72] sick 30 years ago so yes the hope is

[2817.80 - 2821.92] lifetime right now you didn't create
[2820.48 - 2823.80] this problem that you have right now
[2821.92 - 2825.40] with Epstein bar this is a virus that's
[2823.80 - 2828.28] been around this is a virus that's been
[2825.40 - 2831.00] around it's not being acknowledged it's

[2838.80 - 2844.24] things you can do about it and heal and
[2842.00 - 2847.56] when you know about it and you
[2844.24 - 2849.16] understand about it it weakens it see
[2847.56 - 2852.36] see knowing the
[2849.16 - 2854.28] truth that's how you win and it breaks
[2852.36 - 2855.84] down and it cleans up and you can push
[2854.28 - 2857.72] it out of your life and push it out of
[2855.84 - 2859.52] your system when it's mysterious and
[2857.72 - 2860.80] nobody knows what's going on and you're
[2859.52 - 2862.56] just sitting there with symptoms and

[2882.84 - 2889.00] years it's valuable it's worth its
[2885.16 - 2890.64] weight and gold Liquid Gold because it's
[2889.00 - 2892.60] information you've learned it's
[2890.64 - 2895.00] experiences you've experienced it's
