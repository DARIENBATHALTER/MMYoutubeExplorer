[260.00 - 262.16] sarah says i've been following your
[261.36 - 265.12] practice
[262.16 - 266.96] on foods and struggle with excess weight
[265.12 - 268.80] from hormone imbalance do you have any
[266.96 - 270.16] additional tips for someone struggling
[268.80 - 272.72] with hormone weight
[270.16 - 274.72] as i do not have an idea what's going on
[272.72 - 277.76] as i do not like the idea
[274.72 - 280.72] of going on pharmaceuticals that's
[277.76 - 280.96] that's liver issues so that's what that
[280.72 - 283.36] is
[280.96 - 285.44] it's not hormones like weight coming on
[283.36 - 287.36] isn't hormones
[285.44 - 288.48] so that's that's how misinformation
[287.36 - 290.96] works you guys
[288.48 - 292.08] check this out okay so when medical
[290.96 - 294.48] medium booked
[292.08 - 295.12] the medical medium first book came out
[294.48 - 297.20] right
[295.12 - 299.20] this is the new edition right here when
[297.20 - 302.40] when the first book came out
[299.20 - 303.44] i used a word i used a word in the
[302.40 - 306.72] health scene
[303.44 - 309.84] that no one else used at the time
[306.72 - 311.84] the word was misinformation that was a
[309.84 - 314.00] medical medium word of course i didn't
[311.84 - 314.88] create the word so before anybody starts
[314.00 - 316.80] talking crap
[314.88 - 319.24] and smack and say oh now the medical
[316.80 - 321.60] medium is claiming he created the word
[319.24 - 324.08] misinformation
[321.60 - 325.12] but i didn't create the word but what
[324.08 - 328.96] happened
[325.12 - 330.96] was i used the word and i used it a lot
[328.96 - 334.16] when no one in the health scene
[330.96 - 336.56] used the word because the medical
[334.16 - 337.36] the medical establishment science and
[336.56 - 339.28] research
[337.36 - 341.44] medical science research had a
[339.28 - 344.64] tremendous amount of misinformation
[341.44 - 346.48] still due to this day right and so when
[344.64 - 347.68] i broke out on the scene with the book
[346.48 - 349.68] and i've been in the scene
[347.68 - 351.36] for over 30 years but when the first
[349.68 - 354.80] book came out
[351.36 - 356.56] um trish says not true hormones later in
[354.80 - 359.76] life and women cause weight gain
[356.56 - 361.04] trish that's not true but just stay on
[359.76 - 362.56] because i want to help you out with that
[361.04 - 364.16] one so you know
[362.56 - 366.24] what happens trish is your liver gets
[364.16 - 367.04] stagnant and sluggish later on in your
[366.24 - 369.52] lifetime
[367.04 - 370.64] because it gets full of stuff full of
[369.52 - 372.88] crap
[370.64 - 374.00] all kinds of bad things in there toxic
[372.88 - 376.64] heavy metals
[374.00 - 378.48] pesticides herbicides fungicides ddt
[376.64 - 381.76] yeah is inside your liver absolutely

[381.76 - 384.80] gets inside people's livers how do you
[383.68 - 387.04] like that one
[384.80 - 387.92] okay it's blowing on the highways all
[387.04 - 390.72] day long
[387.92 - 393.20] still till this day gasoline fumes
[390.72 - 395.08] petrochemicals plastics your liver gets
[393.20 - 396.96] filled up with plastics
[395.08 - 398.48] pharmaceuticals have you had a
[396.96 - 401.20] pharmaceutical in your life
[398.48 - 402.00] it it it fills into the liver and here's
[401.20 - 403.52] what happens
[402.00 - 405.04] you could be young and your liver can
[403.52 - 405.76] fill up and then the weight starts
[405.04 - 408.16] coming on
[405.76 - 408.96] and guess what you can be older and your
[408.16 - 411.28] and and
[408.96 - 412.08] and your liver fills up and the weight
[411.28 - 413.44] comes on
[412.08 - 415.76] everybody's a little different on their
[413.44 - 419.44] timeline of when that filter
[415.76 - 423.52] gets clogged up really important to know
[419.44 - 426.40] so guys i'm putting in some um
[423.52 - 427.68] onions here i got carrots i got celery
[426.40 - 428.64] i'm making the medical medium healing
[427.68 - 431.04] broth
[428.64 - 431.76] see the hormone blame is just to trick
[431.04 - 434.88] out women
[431.76 - 436.80] and it's bad if you fall for it because
[434.88 - 438.40] yes hormones become imbalanced
[436.80 - 440.16] absolutely and yes
[438.40 - 442.24] i believe in in hormones being
[440.16 - 443.92] imbalanced of course and i believe in
[442.24 - 447.44] every aspect of that
[443.92 - 449.84] but what women have been tricked with is
[447.44 - 451.28] they're blamed for all their problems as
[449.84 - 454.72] being hormonal
[451.28 - 456.56] that was a man's trick to women so
[454.72 - 458.80] medical research and science
[456.56 - 460.48] all men at the time came up with the
[458.80 - 462.96] biggest scam of a century
[460.48 - 464.16] which is everything wrong with you trish
[462.96 - 465.68] and any other woman
[464.16 - 466.72] it's your hormones it's your hormones
[465.68 - 467.20] it's your hormones because you're a
[466.72 - 468.64] woman

[506.72 - 511.44] with the biggest scam
[508.24 - 513.60] biggest scam in that ever did ever be
[511.44 - 515.44] and it's your hormones because they

[535.52 - 540.24] was the game bottom line
[541.36 - 546.40] just letting you know why did they do it
[544.56 - 547.60] one they didn't know what was wrong with
[546.40 - 548.00] anybody they didn't know why you're
[547.60 - 552.32] gaining
[548.00 - 553.92] weight two they needed to sell the
[552.32 - 555.68] out of hormones
[553.92 - 558.00] that's what it was became a trillion
[555.68 - 558.72] dollar industry and they needed to sell
[558.00 - 561.76] the crap
[558.72 - 563.84] out of hormone therapies back in the day
[561.76 - 564.80] and they needed and they needed a
[563.84 - 567.84] scapegoat
[564.80 - 570.16] they needed to put women in their place
[567.84 - 570.96] men needed to put women in their place
[570.16 - 574.72] shut them up
[570.96 - 576.08] sit down it's your hormones that was the
[574.72 - 579.36] medical industry back
[576.08 - 581.52] in the day and it really was i've talked
[579.36 - 584.00] to doctors back in the 90s that were
[581.52 - 586.96] 80 years old that were having they were
[584.00 - 589.36] in the heyday in the 1950s and 60s
[586.96 - 590.24] i've heard it all i know what the scene
[589.36 - 591.84] was
[590.24 - 594.16] so i'm cooking cooking some healing
[591.84 - 594.16] broth
[594.48 - 598.48] so what happened was though they don't
[597.12 - 600.56] let that go
[598.48 - 601.60] that is still here today it's in
[600.56 - 603.84] alternative medicine
[601.60 - 605.36] full throttle it's in conventional
[603.84 - 609.12] medicine full throttle
[605.36 - 610.32] and and weight gain just like many other
[609.12 - 614.00] things
[610.32 - 617.60] is blamed on hormones
[614.00 - 621.52] yes your hormones can be imbalanced yes
[617.60 - 621.52] it can i told you guys
[621.84 - 626.72] get out of my way today because i got a
[624.48 - 628.24] lot of other stuff to talk about
[626.72 - 630.56] so you might want to hang in there for
[628.24 - 630.56] this
[630.96 - 636.96] um a sluggish stagnant liver causes your
[635.52 - 638.56] weight gain
[636.96 - 640.24] and it can happen when you're young and
[638.56 - 644.16] it can happen when you're older
[640.24 - 646.16] it just happens that's what creates the
[644.16 - 647.60] weight gain okay
[646.16 - 649.68] so i'm gonna put a i'm gonna put some
[647.60 - 651.84] shiitakes in here i'm gonna put some
[649.68 - 655.36] mushrooms let's get them in here so
[651.84 - 658.40] get about a cup in here i'll do like
[655.36 - 658.40] a few of these caps
[659.52 - 663.04] you guys what you'll notice right here
[661.04 - 664.24] when i'm cutting you notice i'm not
[663.04 - 666.40] doing it this way
[664.24 - 667.84] i want to show you something okay you
[666.40 - 668.64] know i'm not doing it this way you see
[667.84 - 670.40] this right here
[668.64 - 671.76] see see what i'm doing right here see
[670.40 - 674.64] this
[671.76 - 676.24] right you notice on that the reason why
[674.64 - 677.04] i'm not cutting like that when i'm with
[676.24 - 678.88] you guys
[677.04 - 680.08] and i'm cutting and i'm cutting kind of
[678.88 - 681.52] stupid on here
[680.08 - 684.32] where i'm doing it like this where i'm
[681.52 - 685.92] like oop almost going to cut my thumb

[685.92 - 690.24] doing that
[687.60 - 692.08] is because the way this is all set up
[690.24 - 695.12] and the way the board's rigged
[692.08 - 697.44] is it's not meant right here in in my
[695.12 - 698.40] little kitchen studio right here to do
[697.44 - 700.32] it that way
[698.40 - 701.76] i have to basically clear everything off
[700.32 - 702.00] set the cutting board up differently
[701.76 - 704.08] pull
[702.00 - 705.76] the stuff in and start really chopping
[704.08 - 708.16] fast but we're casually
[705.76 - 708.80] doing this casually chopping so really
[708.16 - 710.32] kind of
[708.80 - 712.48] you know i can just basically just
[710.32 - 713.36] gently chop up stuff but you won't see
[712.48 - 715.28] me do the
[713.36 - 717.28] the pro stuff going on which you could
[715.28 - 718.56] easily do i mean in the sense where just
[717.28 - 720.08] like you guys do
[718.56 - 723.68] where you know you you're cutting
[720.08 - 726.64] everything a certain way
[723.68 - 728.64] but so if you'll notice i'm doing it
[726.64 - 730.40] this way it's only because we're cash
[728.64 - 732.08] and i'm doing it real slow methodical
[730.40 - 735.12] talking at the same time
[732.08 - 739.20] so the way coming on
[735.12 - 740.56] is nita says preaching to sell his books
[739.20 - 742.16] that's funny because you can go into the
[740.56 - 743.76] library and get them for free i've been
[742.16 - 747.52] saying that for years
[743.76 - 749.68] i probably sent millions over the years
[747.52 - 752.64] into the library to actually get them
[749.68 - 756.32] for free and it made me not a penny
[752.64 - 756.88] and i'm the only author that's ever done
[756.32 - 758.16] that
[756.88 - 759.68] where i want everybody to go in the
[758.16 - 760.56] library and get it for free that's
[759.68 - 763.76] number one
[760.56 - 766.72] number two is i can sell i can sell
[763.76 - 768.48] courses for thousands of dollars classes
[766.72 - 770.88] for thousands of dollars
[768.48 - 773.20] i can sell products for thousands of
[770.88 - 774.08] dollars i could be a billionaire
[773.20 - 775.52] tomorrow
[774.08 - 777.12] with the amount of people that know
[775.52 - 778.80] about medical medium which is probably
[777.12 - 780.48] about 500 million people in the world
[778.80 - 784.08] know about medical medium
[780.48 - 785.04] and literally i could bank like nobody
[784.08 - 786.48] can bank
[785.04 - 789.52] and you're worried about me trying to
[786.48 - 791.04] preach about selling a book or something
[789.52 - 792.96] it's interesting you know kind of get
[791.04 - 794.64] your head kind of get your head together
[792.96 - 795.60] and really know the facts about that
[794.64 - 799.28] stuff
[795.60 - 800.96] um and okay so let me not get
[799.28 - 802.48] get you a book that has information
[800.96 - 804.16] that's saving lives how about that
[802.48 - 806.08] how about if i don't write books anymore
[804.16 - 807.44] okay so what about the people's lives
[806.08 - 809.20] that have been saved here because of the
[807.44 - 810.72] medical medium books and they got off at
[809.20 - 811.12] couch island and mattress island and
[810.72 - 812.72] they're
[811.12 - 814.72] able to work for the first time in life
[812.72 - 816.40] should i have not sold them a book
[814.72 - 818.16] should i have not written a book so they
[816.40 - 820.32] can buy spend 16
[818.16 - 821.68] on a book and save their life or do you
[820.32 - 823.60] would you rather have them
[821.68 - 825.20] buy all kinds of stuff out there
[823.60 - 825.84] millions of dollars and millions of
[825.20 - 828.48] dollars of
[825.84 - 830.24] crap sold to people out there and them
[828.48 - 833.04] not getting better how about that
[830.24 - 834.88] and just for the record you guys anita
[833.04 - 835.84] i've been asked to write the books for
[834.88 - 838.24] years decades
[835.84 - 839.76] anthony write a book write a book write
[838.24 - 841.92] a book write a book
[839.76 - 844.40] but i understand what you're saying i
[841.92 - 844.40] understand
[844.80 - 848.00] all right you guys going to get a few
[846.08 - 849.76] more things in here so this is i'm going
[848.00 - 853.04] to actually add some water in this
[849.76 - 853.04] too right now so i'm going to do
[855.68 - 860.48] and get this going so i'm making the
[858.72 - 863.28] healing broth i got two tomatoes that
[860.48 - 863.28] are gonna go in here
[867.12 - 871.04] so i'm gonna chop up some tomatoes
[868.88 - 875.68] that's going to go in the healing broth
[871.04 - 878.64] so here's what causes weight gain
[875.68 - 880.32] years and years of coffee chocolate
[878.64 - 883.28] caffeine
[880.32 - 885.44] a green tea any kind of caffeine energy
[883.28 - 887.44] drinks you burn your liver out you burn
[885.44 - 888.48] your adrenals out and the liver gets
[887.44 - 891.52] burnt out from
[888.48 - 894.16] caffeine from adrenaline highs and then
[891.52 - 896.08] after your 20 years of burning your
[894.16 - 899.12] liver out and adrenals out
[896.08 - 900.00] okay after you do that you end up with
[899.12 - 901.20] the weight gain
[900.00 - 902.48] and it's going to be blamed on your
[901.20 - 904.08] hormones how about that one here's
[902.48 - 904.64] another thing that causes the weight
[904.08 - 907.20] gain
[904.64 - 907.92] the high fat diets see when you're
[907.20 - 910.32] younger
[907.92 - 912.08] and your liver is working pretty good
[910.32 - 913.60] you can do the high fat diet every
[912.08 - 914.96] single day you're taught to eat the high
[913.60 - 915.84] fat diet every day you're taught to eat
[914.96 - 917.92] lots chicken
[915.84 - 919.60] eggs has nothing to do about whether i
[917.92 - 921.68] like animal products or not or
[919.60 - 922.72] i i support animal protein diets i
[921.68 - 925.28] support plant-based
[922.72 - 926.88] diets but every single day you're on a
[925.28 - 927.44] high fat diet how many times did you eat
[926.88 - 928.96] bacon
[927.44 - 930.24] well the liver is going to pay the price
[928.96 - 931.76] later on and your weight is going to
[930.24 - 933.68] come on down the road maybe when you're
[931.76 - 936.80] 40 maybe when you're 50.
[933.68 - 938.56] um you know how many nuts and seeds have
[936.80 - 940.32] you eaten nut butters peanut butter how
[938.56 - 942.08] many oils have you had
[940.32 - 944.16] and then this and then the liver gets
[942.08 - 945.52] sluggish and stagnant it gets beaten
[944.16 - 946.96] down down the road
[945.52 - 948.56] and then your weight gain comes on it
[946.96 - 950.08] might come on when you're 30 and you
[948.56 - 951.20] can't keep it off it might come out when
[950.08 - 953.76] you're 40.
[951.20 - 954.48] all those eggs all the chicken all the
[953.76 - 957.36] fish
[954.48 - 958.08] all the fat right you know it just
[957.36 - 961.28] oatmeal
[958.08 - 964.24] is high in fat just so you know
[961.28 - 966.72] a cup of oatmeal is a minimum of five
[964.24 - 968.80] grams of fat in a cup of oatmeal
[966.72 - 970.48] so it's like not also not only doing
[968.80 - 971.68] bacon and eggs and you're doing chicken
[970.48 - 973.28] you're doing oils
[971.68 - 974.72] and then you're doing you're doing your
[973.28 - 976.24] cheese you're doing your butter and
[974.72 - 977.12] you're doing your chocolate which is
[976.24 - 978.80] high in fat
[977.12 - 980.24] and then on top of that you think you're
[978.80 - 982.00] eating healthy for five seconds eating
[980.24 - 984.08] your oatmeal and then that's high in fat
[982.00 - 986.08] it's like it's like you just it you
[984.08 - 987.84] can't keep it in check so then the liver
[986.08 - 989.92] gets beaten down over the years and then
[987.84 - 990.64] 20 years later boom the weight comes on
[989.92 - 992.72] then
[990.64 - 994.24] the liver has been beaten up by all that
[992.72 - 996.00] caffeine all those years and then what
[994.24 - 997.92] about pharmaceuticals too
[996.00 - 999.68] what about any kind of pharmaceuticals
[997.92 - 1002.96] that's another thing too
[999.68 - 1006.08] trisha marie's here she's here today
[1002.96 - 1007.28] you guys are uh lots of thought i
[1006.08 - 1009.20] haven't even started
[1007.28 - 1010.64] i haven't even started what i have to
[1009.20 - 1013.68] talk about today
[1010.64 - 1015.52] um okay let's see what we got here got
[1013.68 - 1018.64] the tomatoes in i'm gonna put
[1015.52 - 1020.64] i'm gonna put a bulb of garlic
[1018.64 - 1022.72] almost a bulb of garlic in the healing
[1020.64 - 1025.20] broth if you guys just came on
[1022.72 - 1026.56] let's just cover this real quick that's
[1025.20 - 1028.72] the healing broth
[1026.56 - 1030.32] that's in the medical medium new edition
[1028.72 - 1032.00] book right and this is the healing broth
[1030.32 - 1034.00] i'm making this with you guys and then
[1032.00 - 1035.36] if you guys come with me to instagram
[1034.00 - 1036.96] and tiktok you can pick either
[1035.36 - 1038.56] platform i'll be on both just like i'm
[1036.96 - 1040.16] on facebook and youtube right now
[1038.56 - 1042.16] together
[1040.16 - 1044.40] after we leave here if you guys come
[1042.16 - 1046.48] with me
[1044.40 - 1048.24] i'm going to be doing the sweet potato
[1046.48 - 1050.16] tortilla soup and i'm going to be using
[1048.24 - 1052.08] the healing broth as the base for the
[1050.16 - 1054.48] sweet potato tortilla soup
[1052.08 - 1058.08] and that's in medical medium new
[1054.48 - 1058.08] addition revised and expanded
[1059.12 - 1063.60] all right so i got the soup going here
[1061.52 - 1065.44] let's get the bulbs of garlic the garlic
[1063.60 - 1067.20] in here you could do about
[1065.44 - 1070.48] eight cloves you could do a little less
[1067.20 - 1070.48] if that's something you want to do
[1073.44 - 1085.92] start getting these going here
[1081.60 - 1088.56] so here's what's going on
[1085.92 - 1090.16] when the medical medium you know and
[1088.56 - 1092.00] what happens the same thing with
[1090.16 - 1093.60] weight gain with children it's the liver
[1092.00 - 1095.36] and the liver getting maxed out early
[1093.60 - 1096.08] with toxic heavy metals which children
[1095.36 - 1099.52] have
[1096.08 - 1101.28] lots of toxic heavy metals so
[1099.52 - 1102.56] they're passed down from their their
[1101.28 - 1104.08] parents too
[1102.56 - 1108.00] so i'm gonna get some cloves of garlic
[1104.08 - 1111.04] in here i'm throwing that in here
[1108.00 - 1112.08] here's the thing about misinformation i
[1111.04 - 1114.48] used the word
[1112.08 - 1116.00] misinformation when the first book came
[1114.48 - 1117.68] out and i used it in lectures
[1116.00 - 1119.04] shortly before the first book came out
[1117.68 - 1120.96] years ago
[1119.04 - 1123.52] no one was using that word on the
[1120.96 - 1125.44] internet it was all about
[1123.52 - 1127.36] health and everybody thought there was
[1125.44 - 1129.76] no misinformation
[1127.36 - 1131.84] but what i did was i exposed areas of
[1129.76 - 1133.60] where the misinformation was and i spent
[1131.84 - 1137.84] a great deal of time it's about smoky
[1133.60 - 1137.84] mountain paradise i think i just saw
[1139.36 - 1141.68] um
[1142.80 - 1147.84] but what happened is that word i used in
[1145.68 - 1150.32] all my articles i used it on the blog
[1147.84 - 1152.24] i used it everywhere in lectures and
[1150.32 - 1153.84] everything about how much misinformation
[1152.24 - 1155.76] was in the alternative health field
[1153.84 - 1157.92] including the mess up with candida
[1155.76 - 1159.44] including the mess up with the mthfrg
[1157.92 - 1160.24] mutation including the mess up with so
[1159.44 - 1162.72] many different
[1160.24 - 1164.72] uh things and trends and everything so
[1162.72 - 1167.52] misinformation was a big word i use
[1164.72 - 1168.00] now everybody's using against me right
[1167.52 - 1171.04] now
[1168.00 - 1173.20] i put out one truth and they'll say
[1171.04 - 1176.80] misinformation misinformation they're
[1173.20 - 1176.80] actually using my word
[1177.28 - 1180.56] now everybody that's what you see on the
[1179.04 - 1182.40] internet 24 7.
[1180.56 - 1184.56] no one used it before i was the only one
[1182.40 - 1187.20] using it spell showing
[1184.56 - 1188.64] showing showcasing where everybody was
[1187.20 - 1190.64] messing up
[1188.64 - 1192.72] including like coffee enemas how bad
[1190.64 - 1195.76] they were including things in
[1192.72 - 1197.76] alternative movement and then including
[1195.76 - 1200.88] things like shingles right
[1197.76 - 1201.84] medical the medical industry tricks you
[1200.88 - 1204.88] out and says that
[1201.84 - 1205.68] shingles is the chickenpox virus so what
[1204.88 - 1208.24] i did was
[1205.68 - 1208.88] that's misinformation the chicken box
[1208.24 - 1210.88] virus
[1208.88 - 1212.48] is separate that's a different variety
[1210.88 - 1214.08] of virus herpetic family
[1212.48 - 1215.60] the shingles is an entirely different
[1214.08 - 1217.68] virus than the chickenpox
[1215.60 - 1218.88] but they got everybody snowed so i put
[1217.68 - 1221.84] out the truth and said there's
[1218.88 - 1221.84] misinformation
[1224.32 - 1227.84] all right so we got the garlic in there
[1225.76 - 1231.68] that's great
[1227.84 - 1232.72] uh one inch of freshly cut ginger let's
[1231.68 - 1234.48] do that let me
[1232.72 - 1236.08] got some ginger right here making the
[1234.48 - 1239.44] medical medium healing broth if you just
[1236.08 - 1240.88] guys got on here fasten your seatbelts
[1239.44 - 1243.28] because i'm going to be talking some
[1240.88 - 1244.80] stuff in a little bit
[1243.28 - 1246.24] you can peel it back a little i'm
[1244.80 - 1247.44] peeling it back a little you don't have
[1246.24 - 1249.60] to in a healing broth
[1247.44 - 1250.80] you can keep the skin on i've done that
[1249.60 - 1254.00] a whole bunch of times
[1250.80 - 1254.00] do that mostly really
[1255.44 - 1259.12] popping a little ginger in here gonna
[1257.52 - 1262.24] slice that up in this healing broth and
[1259.12 - 1265.60] throw it in
[1262.24 - 1268.40] okay and uh see what else i need i got
[1265.60 - 1270.32] that i got the water in here
[1268.40 - 1271.84] so i think i got my ingredients in there
[1270.32 - 1274.16] i just didn't put my
[1271.84 - 1276.72] put a little chili powder don't put too
[1274.16 - 1279.28] much chili powder i actually
[1276.72 - 1281.04] many times i've made it really hot so
[1279.28 - 1285.36] i'm going to put a little pop in here
[1281.04 - 1285.36] that's it a bit of chili pepper in there
[1287.20 - 1291.12] or red bell pepper flakes really i just
[1289.44 - 1292.64] put the hot stuff too that's something
[1291.12 - 1295.04] you can do if you want
[1292.64 - 1297.44] pepper flakes let me grab some pepper
[1295.04 - 1297.44] flakes
[1301.04 - 1305.04] put some pepper flakes in here if you
[1303.20 - 1305.92] don't like the heat you don't have to do
[1305.04 - 1307.92] a lot of them
[1305.92 - 1310.16] i tend to spike it a little too much and
[1307.92 - 1314.08] the next thing you know i got something
[1310.16 - 1316.08] really hot going on where it's too hot
[1314.08 - 1318.00] i also have a pepper over here i think i
[1316.08 - 1321.28] might pop that in i think i lost my
[1318.00 - 1324.72] hot pepper i think i lost it
[1321.28 - 1326.24] all right let me put the lid on
[1324.72 - 1328.96] oh let me get some parsley and that's
[1326.24 - 1333.84] the last thing here i forgot my parsley
[1328.96 - 1333.84] see you guys
[1338.32 - 1342.24] so now what happens is anything i say
[1340.80 - 1342.88] you'll get a whole bunch of people i'd
[1342.24 - 1345.20] be like
[1342.88 - 1346.08] well science hasn't backed it up
[1345.20 - 1347.44] misinformation
[1346.08 - 1349.12] so i want to talk about that a little
[1347.44 - 1350.64] bit about science and research but
[1349.12 - 1354.40] before i go in there
[1350.64 - 1356.16] it reminds me about genes
[1354.40 - 1358.88] did you guys know that everybody's being
[1356.16 - 1362.24] diagnosed
[1358.88 - 1362.24] as having gene issues
[1363.36 - 1370.96] um amina says bell's palsy
[1366.56 - 1374.64] is shingles but i had it from 2007 is it
[1370.96 - 1376.80] it is improved but have uh
[1374.64 - 1377.68] oh yeah so you still have an issue with
[1376.80 - 1381.04] that now but
[1377.68 - 1382.40] still recovering is all healing in your
[1381.04 - 1384.56] book for me
[1382.40 - 1385.68] is the same for shingles sorry guys i
[1384.56 - 1388.08] got so much
[1385.68 - 1390.00] bright lights in my eyes sometimes a
[1388.08 - 1391.20] reflection on a computer screen is not
[1390.00 - 1394.24] easy to read a comment
[1391.20 - 1396.48] so i'll try it try it better um
[1394.24 - 1398.32] no one knew shingles was bell's palsy
[1396.48 - 1398.80] just for anybody else who's listening
[1398.32 - 1401.92] there
[1398.80 - 1406.24] that was medical medium information
[1401.92 - 1407.84] so now doctors are actually diagnosing
[1406.24 - 1409.20] people with bell's palsy and they're
[1407.84 - 1410.72] saying well it could be the shingles
[1409.20 - 1412.64] virus that originates from
[1410.72 - 1414.00] millions of medical medium books getting
[1412.64 - 1415.76] out there
[1414.00 - 1417.20] this book right here changed the rules
[1415.76 - 1419.36] on bell's palsy
[1417.20 - 1420.88] so and that's the shingles virus so
[1419.36 - 1423.36] that's how it works there
[1420.88 - 1423.92] goes palsy is a non-rashing shingles
[1423.36 - 1426.16] virus
[1423.92 - 1427.44] gonna have shingles and years later it
[1426.16 - 1430.16] show up differently
[1427.44 - 1431.52] but but it but it'll happen when you
[1430.16 - 1433.36] don't even have shingles you don't even
[1431.52 - 1435.92] have a rash but the virus is there and
[1433.36 - 1438.24] it'll cause the bell's palsy
[1435.92 - 1440.08] so i just put uh parsley in here let
[1438.24 - 1443.20] this get ready to cook
[1440.08 - 1445.84] cook up nice so i'm making a healing
[1443.20 - 1445.84] broth
[1446.32 - 1449.28] i want to get this pumping away and i'll
[1447.84 - 1449.92] show you guys the healing broth in a
[1449.28 - 1451.52] little bit
[1449.92 - 1452.80] if you guys just got on here after i do
[1451.52 - 1453.44] the healing broth it's going to be the
[1452.80 - 1455.28] base
[1453.44 - 1459.04] for the sweet potato tortilla soup that
[1455.28 - 1462.80] i'm making on ig and tick tock
[1459.04 - 1462.80] so everybody
[1463.04 - 1470.16] um so everybody like believe
[1466.32 - 1473.12] that first of all the shingles was um
[1470.16 - 1475.04] the chickenpox virus and that's not true
[1473.12 - 1476.96] it's a different bug altogether but that
[1475.04 - 1478.16] just shows you how much misinformation
[1476.96 - 1480.16] is in the medical
[1478.16 - 1481.84] world it's really sad there's
[1480.16 - 1483.44] non-rashing shingles varieties and
[1481.84 - 1485.20] there's rashing varieties
[1483.44 - 1487.04] there's over 30 varieties of shingles
[1485.20 - 1488.80] out there and them info and i brought
[1487.04 - 1491.44] that to light for people
[1488.80 - 1493.36] sciatic nerve pain okay whether you have
[1491.44 - 1495.36] a back issue or not that sciatic
[1493.36 - 1496.40] nerve pain gets really inflamed from the
[1495.36 - 1497.92] shingles virus
[1496.40 - 1500.16] that's one thing right there trigeminal
[1497.92 - 1501.76] neuralgia that's the shingles bell's
[1500.16 - 1503.44] palsy that's the shingles
[1501.76 - 1506.40] so these are things that that medical
[1503.44 - 1506.40] medium brought to light
[1507.12 - 1510.88] but you guys i want to talk about jeans
[1508.64 - 1513.20] for a little bit and head into there
[1510.88 - 1514.40] so fasten your seatbelts a little bit
[1513.20 - 1518.16] because really the
[1514.40 - 1520.64] the gene blame game and
[1518.16 - 1521.20] the gene scam that's upon people right
[1520.64 - 1523.68] now it's
[1521.20 - 1524.40] it's really sad and where it's going
[1523.68 - 1528.32] it's
[1524.40 - 1530.96] they've weaponized the gene terminology
[1528.32 - 1532.88] it weaponized it against everybody so
[1530.96 - 1535.44] it's purposely
[1532.88 - 1536.48] being used against you i want you to
[1535.44 - 1539.20] know this
[1536.48 - 1541.04] you might want to get an herbal tea or
[1539.20 - 1542.24] something lemon balm tea before you hear
[1541.04 - 1546.40] this stuff
[1542.24 - 1549.84] but medical system
[1546.40 - 1552.64] is trying to
[1549.84 - 1554.56] and they're doing a great job convince
[1552.64 - 1557.60] all of you
[1554.56 - 1560.64] that your genes are going bad
[1557.60 - 1563.68] there's a reason for it and
[1560.64 - 1565.44] they want you to believe that not only
[1563.68 - 1568.48] are your genes going bad but your
[1565.44 - 1572.08] children's genes are bad
[1568.48 - 1575.20] and that your children aren't perfect
[1572.08 - 1578.08] and they're all genetically tore up
[1575.20 - 1579.12] they're all genetically mutated it's
[1578.08 - 1581.68] really evil
[1579.12 - 1582.72] actually because the medical system
[1581.68 - 1586.16] wants you
[1582.72 - 1587.52] to think your child's genes are all
[1586.16 - 1589.60] messed up
[1587.52 - 1591.04] that's their game that's the direction
[1589.60 - 1592.48] they have to go
[1591.04 - 1594.16] and there's a reason why they're going
[1592.48 - 1597.44] this direction
[1594.16 - 1599.36] because hey dr fans here even
[1597.44 - 1601.76] even the alternative doctors are saying
[1599.36 - 1605.20] the genes are bad yes
[1601.76 - 1606.00] exactly and so there's a reason because
[1605.20 - 1607.84] a
[1606.00 - 1610.24] they don't know what's causing chronic
[1607.84 - 1611.36] illness so that's the thing there too
[1610.24 - 1613.60] because they don't know what's causing
[1611.36 - 1616.80] chronic illness they need to blame
[1613.60 - 1619.84] you you're the to blame it's you
[1616.80 - 1622.88] you're the problem so your daughter
[1619.84 - 1626.40] your son their genes are bad
[1622.88 - 1629.76] they get one condition colitis crohn's
[1626.40 - 1632.56] celiac eczema psoriasis
[1629.76 - 1632.96] anything anything any kind of condition
[1632.56 - 1634.64] that
[1632.96 - 1636.64] your daughter your son might get or your
[1634.64 - 1639.68] kids or your grandkids may get
[1636.64 - 1640.32] their genes are bad so it's it's it's
[1639.68 - 1644.56] beyond
[1640.32 - 1648.08] evil and twisted it's way beyond that
[1644.56 - 1650.96] um and so what happens is this is that
[1648.08 - 1652.72] you're led to believe now every time you
[1650.96 - 1655.36] have a problem
[1652.72 - 1655.76] that your genes are mutated they want
[1655.36 - 1660.24] you
[1655.76 - 1664.64] to believe that you you are the cause
[1660.24 - 1667.60] of your children's mutated genes
[1664.64 - 1668.00] you hear that that's what they want
[1667.60 - 1670.32] that's
[1668.00 - 1671.28] exactly what they want that's their
[1670.32 - 1674.16] think tank
[1671.28 - 1675.12] that's their agenda they need you to
[1674.16 - 1679.68] believe
[1675.12 - 1683.28] that your children are faulty
[1679.68 - 1687.04] they're not perfect no they're not
[1683.28 - 1687.60] they're not special no their genes are
[1687.04 - 1690.16] all
[1687.60 - 1693.04] bad they want you to know that's what
[1690.16 - 1696.64] they want you to believe
[1693.04 - 1698.16] they need you to believe this okay
[1696.64 - 1700.40] and then they need you to believe that
[1698.16 - 1700.96] your children's children's genes are
[1700.40 - 1704.64] going to be
[1700.96 - 1707.52] worse and they're going to be bad
[1704.64 - 1710.56] they need you to believe that too and so
[1707.52 - 1712.16] what happens is you get older
[1710.56 - 1713.68] you're and you get older and your
[1712.16 - 1716.40] children get older
[1713.68 - 1717.76] and your children have children it's
[1716.40 - 1718.48] going to be way worse than this you're
[1717.76 - 1721.44] going to see it
[1718.48 - 1722.84] more and more and more and more you guys
[1721.44 - 1725.68] are all
[1722.84 - 1726.48] genetically ruined you're all
[1725.68 - 1730.32] genetically
[1726.48 - 1732.64] faulty that's where it's going
[1730.32 - 1733.60] that's where they need it to go and the
[1732.64 - 1735.60] alternative movement
[1733.60 - 1737.20] is following suit now here's something
[1735.60 - 1738.64] to understand the alternative movements
[1737.20 - 1740.48] not the alternate movement anymore
[1738.64 - 1741.76] they're in bed with the conventional
[1740.48 - 1745.28] movement
[1741.76 - 1745.68] get that information in here let it sink
[1745.28 - 1748.72] in
[1745.68 - 1750.24] okay lorraine lorraine lawson
[1748.72 - 1752.08] thank goodness for you and soc thank
[1750.24 - 1755.28] goodness you're here
[1752.08 - 1756.88] and so the goal is okay
[1755.28 - 1759.04] for you not to only think your genes are
[1756.88 - 1762.08] bad not to only think that
[1759.04 - 1765.76] your children's genes are bad you know
[1762.08 - 1766.08] they need you to consciously absorb this
[1765.76 - 1769.20] like
[1766.08 - 1771.28] it to become part of your soul part of
[1769.20 - 1773.20] your consciousness and guess what
[1771.28 - 1774.88] the most spiritual people out there all
[1773.20 - 1776.80] believe it how do you like that
[1774.88 - 1778.96] they all believe it oh all those
[1776.80 - 1780.88] affirmations everybody wants people to
[1778.96 - 1782.40] do and all the meditations and all the
[1780.88 - 1786.40] affirmations
[1782.40 - 1789.12] and all of all of the you know promoting
[1786.40 - 1792.56] the intuition
[1789.12 - 1793.60] but yet they all believe gene just your
[1792.56 - 1795.36] genes are bad
[1793.60 - 1797.04] the genes are why they're sick genes are
[1795.36 - 1797.44] why their family members get sick genes
[1797.04 - 1800.96] are why
[1797.44 - 1804.32] everybody's get sick say genes are why
[1800.96 - 1805.60] people have all this cancer and that's
[1804.32 - 1807.28] how it's getting rigged up
[1805.60 - 1809.04] so you could be a real spiritual person
[1807.28 - 1811.04] totally into everything tend to yoga you
[1809.04 - 1811.76] tune everything like namaste you're all
[1811.04 - 1814.48] the way
[1811.76 - 1816.24] you're like you know you're you're like
[1814.48 - 1817.84] essential oils incense
[1816.24 - 1819.28] you're just spiritual you're seeing
[1817.84 - 1820.64] things you're hearing things
[1819.28 - 1823.04] you're hanging out with friends at night
[1820.64 - 1825.52] talking about the stars
[1823.04 - 1826.40] meanwhile you believe your genes are bad
[1825.52 - 1827.68] and you're gonna just
[1826.40 - 1829.44] you're just gonna oh my alternative
[1827.68 - 1831.12] doctor is saying it's genetic i got a
[1829.44 - 1832.08] gene mutation my child's got a gene
[1831.12 - 1834.84] mutation
[1832.08 - 1837.52] and you're just gonna believe it it
[1834.84 - 1840.72] destroys it destroys the
[1837.52 - 1842.32] the center of your consciousness without
[1840.72 - 1845.68] you even knowing it
[1842.32 - 1848.64] it is poison
[1845.68 - 1849.04] poison in your veins but it's poison in
[1848.64 - 1852.80] your
[1849.04 - 1856.64] soul on a deep deep dark
[1852.80 - 1860.80] level and it's set up that way purposely
[1856.64 - 1864.56] so it's not the viruses the epstein bars
[1860.80 - 1867.60] and the shingles virus hhv-6 hhv7
[1864.56 - 1868.64] simplex other viruses too sedimental
[1867.60 - 1872.56] virus it's not the
[1868.64 - 1874.88] viruses that are causing any problems no
[1872.56 - 1876.32] it's not the toxic heavy metals the
[1874.88 - 1879.12] mercury inside your brain
[1876.32 - 1880.80] giving you anxiety depression ocd the
[1879.12 - 1881.28] mercury inside your brain that's giving
[1880.80 - 1882.88] you
[1881.28 - 1884.72] all kinds of conditions severe
[1882.88 - 1888.88] depression depersonalization
[1884.72 - 1891.68] bipolar mania schizophrenia it's not
[1888.88 - 1892.00] that metal causing any problems no it's
[1891.68 - 1893.60] not
[1892.00 - 1895.44] at all it's not the pesticides
[1893.60 - 1896.96] herbicides fungicides you breathe in
[1895.44 - 1898.56] every single day out there
[1896.96 - 1900.32] that's on your neighbor's lawn around
[1898.56 - 1901.76] everybody's apartment buildings and on
[1900.32 - 1903.52] the sides of the highway as you've got
[1901.76 - 1905.52] your windows rolled down
[1903.52 - 1907.12] it's not those toxic chemicals it's not
[1905.52 - 1908.64] the petrochemicals you breathe in at the
[1907.12 - 1910.40] gas station every single
[1908.64 - 1912.16] time you're there filling your tank it's
[1910.40 - 1913.60] not the plastic that's filling into your
[1912.16 - 1915.92] body every single day
[1913.60 - 1917.20] it's none of this it's not the radiation
[1915.92 - 1920.64] that's falling out of the sky
[1917.20 - 1923.44] since hiroshima and fukushima
[1920.64 - 1924.96] it's not it's not like that radiation
[1923.44 - 1928.16] that's raining down
[1924.96 - 1930.24] on us it's not you know
[1928.16 - 1932.24] it's not any of the chemical warfare
[1930.24 - 1933.84] that's being dropped on us out there on
[1932.24 - 1935.36] planes
[1933.84 - 1937.04] it's not the pharmaceuticals that have
[1935.36 - 1938.96] been in her system with all that
[1937.04 - 1941.04] titanium in it
[1938.96 - 1942.40] and all those metals and it's not any of
[1941.04 - 1945.20] those pharmaceuticals no
[1942.40 - 1946.72] it's none of that it's not the ddt that
[1945.20 - 1948.00] we still breathe in every day because
[1946.72 - 1950.32] guess what they didn't ban
[1948.00 - 1951.76] ddt it's still being used every day out
[1950.32 - 1953.52] there and it's floating around
[1951.76 - 1955.28] everywhere you go outside you're like
[1953.52 - 1958.96] you breathe it right in
[1955.28 - 1960.48] it's not any of this all over the world
[1958.96 - 1962.96] the ddt is just floating around
[1960.48 - 1965.20] everywhere and
[1962.96 - 1967.36] and it's not it's not the travel on the
[1965.20 - 1969.68] planes and all the radiation on plane
[1967.36 - 1974.16] flights that are longer than an hour
[1969.68 - 1977.20] it's not that it's not the oil spills
[1974.16 - 1978.72] in the in the oceans it's not all the
[1977.20 - 1980.40] crap in the oceans
[1978.72 - 1982.00] that you actually get on your skin when
[1980.40 - 1983.68] you're doing like a swim
[1982.00 - 1985.28] it's none of that it's none of that it's
[1983.68 - 1989.20] your genes
[1985.28 - 1992.48] that's what it is how does it feel
[1989.20 - 1992.80] right how does it feel it's your body
[1992.48 - 1995.36] you're
[1992.80 - 1997.04] faulty you're no good i thought we were
[1995.36 - 1998.64] like spiritually evolved i thought
[1997.04 - 1999.76] alternative doctors were spiritually
[1998.64 - 2000.72] evolved but don't mean they're
[1999.76 - 2002.32] spiritually evolved
[2000.72 - 2004.56] you can be an alternative doctor but it
[2002.32 - 2006.40] don't mean crap
[2004.56 - 2008.00] about spiritual growth and spiritual
[2006.40 - 2010.72] evolvement
[2008.00 - 2011.52] and you can be a conventional doctor
[2010.72 - 2014.88] don't mean you're
[2011.52 - 2016.40] spiritually growing you know and
[2014.88 - 2017.36] every time i throw the truth out there
[2016.40 - 2018.00] and that's what i've been doing all
[2017.36 - 2019.60] these years all
[2018.00 - 2022.16] you hear is smack about me and
[2019.60 - 2024.88] everything because of it because
[2022.16 - 2026.56] no one likes to hear it they don't want
[2024.88 - 2028.56] if you actually have been doing
[2026.56 - 2029.36] something your whole life or believing
[2028.56 - 2031.20] in something
[2029.36 - 2032.72] you think you want to be proved wrong
[2031.20 - 2033.68] when you invested all this time and
[2032.72 - 2035.44] energy in it
[2033.68 - 2037.60] when you invested time and energy in it
[2035.44 - 2038.64] you think you want the truth to stand in
[2037.60 - 2041.28] your way when you
[2038.64 - 2041.92] already told everybody what you believed
[2041.28 - 2043.76] in did
[2041.92 - 2046.24] everything you believe in what your work
[2043.76 - 2047.68] is and then it just people try to defend
[2046.24 - 2049.60] it with their life they
[2047.68 - 2051.20] they push away the truth to defend
[2049.60 - 2052.64] whatever they've been doing because what
[2051.20 - 2054.16] they've been doing is basically
[2052.64 - 2056.08] fraudulent
[2054.16 - 2057.76] and that's what happens when you put
[2056.08 - 2059.36] truth out there so when you put truth
[2057.76 - 2061.60] out there about the genes
[2059.36 - 2063.28] and about how literally they want your
[2061.60 - 2064.88] children to believe their genes are
[2063.28 - 2067.04] messed up you know what children do
[2064.88 - 2069.60] children teenagers though i hear this
[2067.04 - 2072.24] from moms i hear this from doctors
[2069.60 - 2073.36] that tell me that their their mom
[2072.24 - 2076.48] patients
[2073.36 - 2078.48] their kids 15 16 17 years old are
[2076.48 - 2079.92] on the computer after their diagnosis
[2078.48 - 2080.32] from the doctor's office and they're
[2079.92 - 2082.56] being
[2080.32 - 2083.76] in the computer on the internet it says
[2082.56 - 2086.08] you got a gene
[2083.76 - 2087.44] problem you know it's genetic and you
[2086.08 - 2089.60] got like people
[2087.44 - 2091.84] i hear it all the time from doctors that
[2089.60 - 2095.60] don't believe in the whole gene thing
[2091.84 - 2099.04] thank god there's some out there and
[2095.60 - 2103.52] they see the damage being done there's
[2099.04 - 2107.20] it's a technique it's a weaponization
[2103.52 - 2109.36] to make sure we believe
[2107.20 - 2110.56] we're not only faulty as human beings
[2109.36 - 2113.76] physically
[2110.56 - 2116.88] physically but we're destroying
[2113.76 - 2118.72] the planet in a way where we're making
[2116.88 - 2121.76] our offspring
[2118.72 - 2124.08] is is broken
[2121.76 - 2125.60] they want you to believe as a mom well i
[2124.08 - 2126.08] don't know if i should have a baby
[2125.60 - 2127.92] because
[2126.08 - 2129.12] if i have a baby and the baby's gonna
[2127.92 - 2131.92] have all these genetic
[2129.12 - 2133.44] all these genetic issues what am i going
[2131.92 - 2136.48] to do this is not good and then
[2133.44 - 2137.12] and then it's only getting worse it's a
[2136.48 - 2139.84] sick
[2137.12 - 2141.44] sick evil plot that's just part of it
[2139.84 - 2143.60] i'm not even going into the rest of it
[2141.44 - 2146.56] there's lots of there's lots of reasons
[2143.60 - 2149.28] why it's a sick evil plot
[2146.56 - 2151.92] um ruthie says i followed the medical
[2149.28 - 2153.84] medium thyroid healing for a nodule when
[2151.92 - 2157.28] i went back to the endocrinologist for
[2153.84 - 2160.00] ultrasound follow-up he said it shrank
[2157.28 - 2160.80] and looked at me in awe and said what
[2160.00 - 2164.56] did you do
[2160.80 - 2169.20] i told a medical medium ruthie amazing
[2164.56 - 2173.76] amazing incredible so
[2169.20 - 2176.00] um look so when it comes down to genes
[2173.76 - 2177.20] and genes being weaponized that's what's
[2176.00 - 2180.00] happening right now
[2177.20 - 2181.44] and now they're weaponizing science so
[2180.00 - 2182.96] let's talk about that a little bit
[2181.44 - 2184.00] you know you guys if you just came on
[2182.96 - 2185.28] here before i talk about the whole
[2184.00 - 2186.72] weaponizing science
[2185.28 - 2188.40] which you guys might want to hear right
[2186.72 - 2190.48] here um
[2188.40 - 2191.76] i'm making the healing broth it's
[2190.48 - 2193.60] cooking
[2191.76 - 2196.40] right here so i'll show you what it
[2193.60 - 2196.40] looks like a little bit
[2196.48 - 2202.32] this is the healing broth um
[2200.24 - 2203.76] so i got carrots in there i got celery i
[2202.32 - 2205.12] got onions this is the medical meme
[2203.76 - 2206.00] healing broth that's helped so many
[2205.12 - 2207.68] people
[2206.00 - 2209.12] uh in this time of year depending on
[2207.68 - 2211.84] where you are in the world it's a great
[2209.12 - 2211.84] time for this
[2212.84 - 2215.84] so
[2216.48 - 2221.12] and what i'm going to be doing is on ig
[2219.44 - 2222.56] and tiktok i'm going to be on that those
[2221.12 - 2224.32] platforms at the same time i'm going to
[2222.56 - 2225.60] make the sweet potato soup so you might
[2224.32 - 2227.04] want to go from here to
[2225.60 - 2229.52] there and the healing bra is going to be
[2227.04 - 2233.04] the base for it so
[2229.52 - 2236.64] we'll talk about weaponizing science
[2233.04 - 2241.04] they want the young people to believe
[2236.64 - 2244.16] that science is everything that science
[2241.04 - 2246.08] is all knowing that science is not
[2244.16 - 2248.80] flawed on any level
[2246.08 - 2249.68] that's what they need young people
[2248.80 - 2252.00] growing up
[2249.68 - 2253.76] right now they need them to believe that
[2252.00 - 2257.12] science
[2253.76 - 2259.28] is flawless that
[2257.12 - 2260.48] science doesn't have anything wrong with
[2259.28 - 2263.04] it at all
[2260.48 - 2264.56] and there's a technique for that there's
[2263.04 - 2266.00] a reason why they're doing this this why
[2264.56 - 2267.60] you'll see all over the internet you'll
[2266.00 - 2269.12] see all these people and all these
[2267.60 - 2270.40] trolls and clones that call them and
[2269.12 - 2272.16] they'll just be out there
[2270.40 - 2273.92] and they'll just be like where's where's
[2272.16 - 2275.20] the science what about this science
[2273.92 - 2277.04] study what about that
[2275.20 - 2278.64] and there's a lot of issues around this
[2277.04 - 2281.68] that i got to tell you that's really
[2278.64 - 2284.08] important to know like to begin with
[2281.68 - 2286.00] science studies hasn't fixed anyone with
[2284.08 - 2286.80] chronic illness so a science study can't
[2286.00 - 2288.64] fix you
[2286.80 - 2290.56] you can read all the science studies you
[2288.64 - 2292.08] want but it's not going to get somebody
[2290.56 - 2293.84] better that's really struggling or on
[2292.08 - 2294.80] mattress island or couch island so
[2293.84 - 2297.36] that's number one
[2294.80 - 2298.08] so kind of like put that put that in the
[2297.36 - 2300.40] database
[2298.08 - 2302.88] it's important to know and what they
[2300.40 - 2304.56] want everybody to do is they want
[2302.88 - 2306.64] people to believe that there's a
[2304.56 - 2309.84] scientific study
[2306.64 - 2312.48] waiting to heal them or waiting to
[2309.84 - 2312.88] cure them the word that they all use out
[2312.48 - 2315.84] there
[2312.88 - 2318.16] right and they believe that there's just
[2315.84 - 2318.56] gonna be this miracle scientific study
[2318.16 - 2321.44] that's
[2318.56 - 2323.20] just around the corner it's right around
[2321.44 - 2325.28] the corner you guys
[2323.20 - 2326.24] and they want you to be a dog waiting
[2325.28 - 2328.72] for a bone
[2326.24 - 2330.16] they want us all like dogs okay that's
[2328.72 - 2332.40] what they want us to be like
[2330.16 - 2334.40] so we're just dogs waiting for a bone
[2332.40 - 2334.96] we're like where's my bone where's my
[2334.40 - 2337.20] bone
[2334.96 - 2338.96] oh wait a minute two years later another
[2337.20 - 2340.32] scientific study can come out is it
[2338.96 - 2341.84] going to save my life
[2340.32 - 2343.92] is another scientific study going to
[2341.84 - 2346.88] come out i mean there's people been sick
[2343.92 - 2349.12] 30 40 years with chronic fatigue and no
[2346.88 - 2349.84] scientific studies come out has ever
[2349.12 - 2351.12] helped them
[2349.84 - 2353.60] there's people with hashimoto's
[2351.12 - 2354.96] thyroiditis the worst eczema psoriasis
[2353.60 - 2356.96] no scientific study
[2354.96 - 2358.40] is going to take care of them there's
[2356.96 - 2360.80] people with multiple sclerosis no
[2358.40 - 2362.64] scientific studies going to help them
[2360.80 - 2364.80] there's people with all these different
[2362.64 - 2366.64] conditions and they're waiting
[2364.80 - 2368.56] tingles and numbness aches and pains
[2366.64 - 2369.04] burning skin ringing in the ears there's
[2368.56 - 2371.12] no time
[2369.04 - 2373.68] science to scientific study that's going
[2371.12 - 2377.76] to go and save somebody with any of that
[2373.68 - 2380.56] and you know what's funny is is that
[2377.76 - 2381.12] so we're we have to sit there waiting
[2380.56 - 2384.40] for
[2381.12 - 2387.04] these scientific studies as if
[2384.40 - 2389.04] they're like frosting at the mouth as if
[2387.04 - 2391.92] this scientific study
[2389.04 - 2392.48] is gonna be the saving grace somewhere
[2391.92 - 2396.32] and
[2392.48 - 2398.24] here's the thing
[2396.32 - 2399.84] everybody's always saying where's your
[2398.24 - 2401.68] scientific proof where's your study
[2399.84 - 2404.00] where's your peer review study well
[2401.68 - 2404.80] or oh i'm gonna or i'm gonna link this
[2404.00 - 2407.28] study here
[2404.80 - 2408.32] go check out this study that's not gonna
[2407.28 - 2410.64] fix anybody
[2408.32 - 2412.48] you can link and check out every study
[2410.64 - 2414.16] you want to check out out there every
[2412.48 - 2416.00] scientific study out there
[2414.16 - 2417.52] and it's not going to fix anybody with
[2416.00 - 2418.88] psoriasis or eczema
[2417.52 - 2420.96] it's not going to fix somebody with
[2418.88 - 2423.60] lupus it's not going to fix somebody
[2420.96 - 2425.52] with any kind of condition
[2423.60 - 2427.28] so that's something to know right there
[2425.52 - 2430.84] but they want you
[2427.28 - 2434.24] to believe and they want the younger
[2430.84 - 2437.20] generation to believe
[2434.24 - 2438.56] wholeheartedly etched in their soul
[2437.20 - 2439.28] their mind their consciousness their
[2438.56 - 2442.64] whole being
[2439.28 - 2446.48] they want them to believe that science
[2442.64 - 2449.84] is a religion science is a god
[2446.48 - 2451.12] science is above god science is even
[2449.84 - 2453.44] bigger than that
[2451.12 - 2455.12] you can't mess with science and so that
[2453.44 - 2457.44] leads me to the next part i want to talk
[2455.12 - 2461.12] to you about with this okay
[2457.44 - 2464.64] so here's okay perfect
[2461.12 - 2465.12] g says um i think the comment i want to
[2464.64 - 2468.48] say
[2465.12 - 2472.16] we wouldn't have cell phones okay
[2468.48 - 2474.16] and physics right so here's the thing
[2472.16 - 2475.36] science and chronic illness is not that
[2474.16 - 2478.24] science
[2475.36 - 2479.84] just so you know you that's the ploy
[2478.24 - 2481.20] that's the trick out and that's the next
[2479.84 - 2483.12] part i was going into
[2481.20 - 2484.40] you look at your cell phone i got mine
[2483.12 - 2486.72] over here
[2484.40 - 2487.60] whoa science is going really amazing
[2486.72 - 2489.20] look at this
[2487.60 - 2491.84] i could text somebody from around the
[2489.20 - 2493.36] world wait hello oh my god science is
[2491.84 - 2494.16] incredible i can hear somebody at the
[2493.36 - 2496.88] end of this phone
[2494.16 - 2497.60] because science is ingenious you can't
[2496.88 - 2499.28] mess with that
[2497.60 - 2500.72] wait i could send emails through my
[2499.28 - 2503.68] phone whoa emails
[2500.72 - 2505.92] emails that's science right that kind of
[2503.68 - 2508.80] technology isn't what i'm talking about
[2505.92 - 2510.96] okay that kind of technology is not
[2508.80 - 2513.04] science and chronic illness
[2510.96 - 2514.64] all right okay how about this science do
[2513.04 - 2515.60] you like this science how about this
[2514.64 - 2519.52] okay
[2515.60 - 2523.52] all right in the 1940s the 1950s
[2519.52 - 2525.52] the 1960s the 1970s
[2523.52 - 2527.68] if you were a girl and you had a little
[2525.52 - 2530.32] bit of anxiety and you were 20
[2527.68 - 2532.16] if you were 18 19 if you were 15 if you
[2530.32 - 2535.76] were 28
[2532.16 - 2538.32] young women 28 25 if you
[2535.76 - 2539.04] had a little bit of anxiety you were
[2538.32 - 2541.92] eligible
[2539.04 - 2544.08] for a lobotomy and guess what hundreds
[2541.92 - 2544.32] and hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[2544.08 - 2547.04] of
[2544.32 - 2547.68] young women had a probe stuck up their
[2547.04 - 2550.56] nose
[2547.68 - 2551.20] and the front of their brain tore off
[2550.56 - 2555.68] and
[2551.20 - 2558.00] taken out of through their nasal cavity
[2555.68 - 2558.88] just to see if it will treat their
[2558.00 - 2561.52] science
[2558.88 - 2563.28] their start treat their anxiety or any
[2561.52 - 2565.52] other kind of emotional
[2563.28 - 2566.80] problem they were having that was
[2565.52 - 2570.00] science at its
[2566.80 - 2571.20] best then it was indisputable because it
[2570.00 - 2573.84] was science
[2571.20 - 2575.60] okay it was indisputable because it was
[2573.84 - 2579.28] science how would you like to be
[2575.60 - 2580.32] there in 1965 and have the front of your
[2579.28 - 2582.16] brain removed
[2580.32 - 2584.00] and now you don't even know your name
[2582.16 - 2585.20] and you just sit in a rocking chair for
[2584.00 - 2587.44] the rest of your life
[2585.20 - 2589.68] for no reason and that was science how
[2587.44 - 2593.36] about that
[2589.68 - 2597.04] because science knew all and science
[2593.36 - 2597.84] never gets slapped it never gets smacked
[2597.04 - 2601.92] it never gets
[2597.84 - 2604.08] punished it's ruined millions of lives
[2601.92 - 2605.36] millions of lives millions of girls
[2604.08 - 2607.60] lives okay
[2605.36 - 2609.52] that's one example let's go into lyme
[2607.60 - 2613.04] disease so science is so
[2609.52 - 2614.72] great in the 1980s in the late 1970s and
[2613.04 - 2618.40] 1980s
[2614.72 - 2621.92] and 1990s and 2000s
[2618.40 - 2624.40] hundreds of thousands of women have
[2621.92 - 2625.20] not only lost their lives in different
[2624.40 - 2629.28] ways
[2625.20 - 2631.84] including died from antibiotic overuse
[2629.28 - 2634.56] from being diagnosed with lyme disease
[2631.84 - 2638.08] and being treated wrong
[2634.56 - 2641.20] lives destroyed awake you guys
[2638.08 - 2642.40] don't even know or realize but wait a
[2641.20 - 2645.68] minute
[2642.40 - 2646.72] um couldn't have uh couldn't have a good
[2645.68 - 2648.56] cell connection
[2646.72 - 2650.32] couldn't have a good tv connection
[2648.56 - 2652.24] couldn't be watching all different
[2650.32 - 2653.76] all the different tv shows you can watch
[2652.24 - 2656.32] or anything you want to do
[2653.76 - 2659.76] i get it your car is totally decked out
[2656.32 - 2659.76] you got wi-fi in your car
[2659.84 - 2666.96] but that's the trick out the trick out
[2663.60 - 2668.24] is that the young people they see all
[2666.96 - 2669.60] this technology
[2668.24 - 2671.36] and they think science has got them
[2669.60 - 2673.52] covered all the way
[2671.36 - 2675.12] without a doubt science is everything i
[2673.52 - 2676.88] have nothing against science i believe
[2675.12 - 2679.36] in science
[2676.88 - 2680.64] but when it comes down to chronic
[2679.36 - 2683.20] illness
[2680.64 - 2684.08] no science is let out of the gate that
[2683.20 - 2687.28] really can
[2684.08 - 2689.60] fix people and that's done on purpose
[2687.28 - 2691.44] see look around you do you think there's
[2689.60 - 2692.80] anything bad going on around there
[2691.44 - 2695.44] around the world do you think there's
[2692.80 - 2697.36] anything bad going on do you think
[2695.44 - 2698.88] there's bad going on with the pollution
[2697.36 - 2700.40] what's your fight what's your
[2698.88 - 2702.24] what's your thought out there what are
[2700.40 - 2703.68] you thinking out there like what's going
[2702.24 - 2706.80] bad in the world to you
[2703.68 - 2709.28] okay where is it is it
[2706.80 - 2711.44] you know people's rights are you worried
[2709.28 - 2713.84] about people having rights
[2711.44 - 2715.68] are you worried about racism are you
[2713.84 - 2718.00] worried about rights issues
[2715.68 - 2718.72] are you worried about oil spilled in the
[2718.00 - 2722.48] in
[2718.72 - 2725.36] in in the oceans are you worried about
[2722.48 - 2725.68] what like what's your fight like what is
[2725.36 - 2727.92] it
[2725.68 - 2728.72] that you're that you're fighting for
[2727.92 - 2730.96] because
[2728.72 - 2732.56] we know the world is corrupt we know the
[2730.96 - 2734.56] world is messed up
[2732.56 - 2737.28] we know that there's all these bad
[2734.56 - 2739.92] things happening in the world right
[2737.28 - 2742.08] we know that there's all kinds of things
[2739.92 - 2744.16] going wrong you're worried about 5g
[2742.08 - 2746.08] right you know when i talk to people
[2744.16 - 2747.52] every day it's like i'm always like what
[2746.08 - 2748.96] are you worried about and then someone
[2747.52 - 2750.24] told me i'm worried about 5g and then
[2748.96 - 2750.88] someone will tell me why i'm worried
[2750.24 - 2753.44] about
[2750.88 - 2754.56] you know i'm worried about racism
[2753.44 - 2756.64] another person will say
[2754.56 - 2758.00] i'm worried about um i'm worried about
[2756.64 - 2759.60] chemicals in our ocean
[2758.00 - 2761.20] another person is like i'm worried about
[2759.60 - 2762.72] the great garbage patch out in the
[2761.20 - 2766.00] pacific ocean
[2762.72 - 2768.08] where it's the size of texas and it's
[2766.00 - 2769.84] eating up wildlife and all these birds
[2768.08 - 2771.28] are swallowing all this plastic
[2769.84 - 2772.40] and that's what i'm worried about i
[2771.28 - 2773.68] talked to somebody else and they're
[2772.40 - 2774.08] worried about all these little plastic
[2773.68 - 2776.32] straws
[2774.08 - 2777.52] and bottles in the ocean and then i
[2776.32 - 2779.04] talked to somebody else they're worried
[2777.52 - 2781.44] about a polluted lake
[2779.04 - 2783.68] and then we're you know like everybody's
[2781.44 - 2787.04] like worried about something right
[2783.68 - 2789.76] and so we know the world's messed up
[2787.04 - 2790.32] you know the world's messed up right and
[2789.76 - 2794.72] then
[2790.32 - 2797.68] but science isn't oh wait wait a minute
[2794.72 - 2800.84] science isn't you mean to tell me that
[2797.68 - 2805.84] there's no bad people in science
[2800.84 - 2809.92] i you mean to tell me wait a minute
[2805.84 - 2811.52] there's no bad anything in science
[2809.92 - 2813.12] i'm confused that's a head scratcher for
[2811.52 - 2816.32] me all right like
[2813.12 - 2819.28] so there's angels
[2816.32 - 2820.08] so everybody in science they're angels
[2819.28 - 2822.72] uh
[2820.08 - 2823.76] right they're holy angels is that who's
[2822.72 - 2826.72] in science
[2823.76 - 2828.32] so every single man in science is a holy
[2826.72 - 2831.20] angel
[2828.32 - 2832.16] that could do no wrong is that what it
[2831.20 - 2834.40] is
[2832.16 - 2835.28] like okay so i'm because i'm scratching
[2834.40 - 2836.88] my head so
[2835.28 - 2838.96] all the scientists there's not one bad
[2836.88 - 2840.24] person at a lot so all the millions of
[2838.96 - 2842.16] scientists around the world
[2840.24 - 2844.32] they're all telling the truth there's
[2842.16 - 2846.32] not one that lies oh wait
[2844.32 - 2848.24] there's not one scientist that's a bad
[2846.32 - 2849.36] person that doesn't beat their wife when
[2848.24 - 2851.92] they come home
[2849.36 - 2852.72] um there's no there's not one scientist
[2851.92 - 2855.52] that hasn't
[2852.72 - 2856.72] there's not one science scientist that
[2855.52 - 2859.04] hasn't like
[2856.72 - 2862.24] done something bad no they're all
[2859.04 - 2864.72] perfect every single person is perfect
[2862.24 - 2866.32] in science wait a minute the scientific
[2864.72 - 2869.44] community is perfect
[2866.32 - 2873.92] flawless they could not do no wrong
[2869.44 - 2877.28] um interesting wait a minute um
[2873.92 - 2879.76] the people that pay and hire scientists
[2877.28 - 2880.48] and the people that pay for science to
[2879.76 - 2882.64] be done
[2880.48 - 2884.08] oh they can't do no wrong either so the
[2882.64 - 2886.00] funders of science
[2884.08 - 2887.60] can't do no wrong so you mean to tell me
[2886.00 - 2891.20] there's not one
[2887.60 - 2894.80] bad lot out there there's not one
[2891.20 - 2896.96] bad funder of science the biggest
[2894.80 - 2898.64] industries out there that are paying for
[2896.96 - 2900.48] all the scientific studies
[2898.64 - 2902.48] you mean to tell me that every one of
[2900.48 - 2903.68] those big industries that are paying for
[2902.48 - 2906.80] scientific studies
[2903.68 - 2909.44] haven't done one thing wrong at all
[2906.80 - 2910.56] i didn't know it's all perfect out there
[2909.44 - 2912.32] science is perfect
[2910.56 - 2914.08] the people who pay for scientific
[2912.32 - 2916.56] studies are perfect the medical
[2914.08 - 2917.12] industry is perfect everything's perfect
[2916.56 - 2919.84] out there
[2917.12 - 2922.40] and there's no agendas at all and
[2919.84 - 2925.20] there's no interests involved
[2922.40 - 2926.96] i didn't know because i don't know what
[2925.20 - 2929.44] world
[2926.96 - 2931.04] everybody's living in about thinking
[2929.44 - 2931.52] that all you got to say is the word
[2931.04 - 2934.56] science
[2931.52 - 2935.44] hey uh yeah um is there any science with
[2934.56 - 2937.04] that because
[2935.44 - 2939.44] all i got to do is we'll use that word
[2937.04 - 2941.60] science hey pal um
[2939.44 - 2944.72] that's science word and then we're all
[2941.60 - 2947.36] clear whoa he said science whoa
[2944.72 - 2948.72] wait wait a study whoa wait what study
[2947.36 - 2950.56] because that can't be wrong
[2948.72 - 2952.00] that scientific study can't be wrong
[2950.56 - 2956.96] there can't be anything wrong with
[2952.00 - 2960.24] it um
[2956.96 - 2963.36] science says asbestos was
[2960.24 - 2964.80] fine and safe and then we got like
[2963.36 - 2966.56] millions of people around the world
[2964.80 - 2967.60] dying from asbestos cancer in their
[2966.56 - 2970.16] lungs
[2967.60 - 2972.08] science said cigarettes were fine for us
[2970.16 - 2975.28] they were actually great for us
[2972.08 - 2976.80] science says that that mesh they stuck
[2975.28 - 2979.28] in for hernias
[2976.80 - 2981.04] was perfectly fine they did all the math
[2979.28 - 2982.64] they did all the science they made this
[2981.04 - 2984.56] really nice mesh that you can put in
[2982.64 - 2985.68] your abdomen and there's a billion
[2984.56 - 2987.44] lawsuits
[2985.68 - 2989.44] science said those lobotomies for all
[2987.44 - 2990.96] those girls ruined
[2989.44 - 2993.60] millions of lives actually around the
[2990.96 - 2995.44] planet they lay a girl on a table
[2993.60 - 2996.64] they knock her out and they stick a
[2995.44 - 2998.96] probe up her nose
[2996.64 - 3001.12] and they pull the front of her brain off
[2998.96 - 3003.44] that i don't think that didn't happen
[3001.12 - 3004.24] and science said that the lyme disease
[3003.44 - 3006.64] treatments
[3004.24 - 3008.48] for all those women that literally has
[3006.64 - 3009.20] killed so many of them and you can't
[3008.48 - 3011.12] talk about it
[3009.20 - 3013.12] you talk about it anywhere and everybody
[3011.12 - 3015.28] gets silenced because you can't go
[3013.12 - 3017.44] against science because science is god
[3015.28 - 3020.32] and they need every single person
[3017.44 - 3020.88] to be science brainwashed like it's it's
[3020.32 - 3023.04] more than
[3020.88 - 3024.24] kool-aid it's like here's the kool-aid
[3023.04 - 3025.76] the science kool-aid
[3024.24 - 3027.68] once you drink that science kool-aid
[3025.76 - 3030.64] like whoa and what they do is
[3027.68 - 3032.56] they're teaching the youth that boy
[3030.64 - 3035.28] science is amazing like
[3032.56 - 3036.72] all the technology you got going on you
[3035.28 - 3039.60] know
[3036.72 - 3040.72] it's incredible science has become
[3039.60 - 3042.96] weaponized
[3040.72 - 3044.48] so that's what's happening there it's
[3042.96 - 3046.88] become weaponized
[3044.48 - 3047.60] and that's what's going on with science
[3046.88 - 3051.12] it's
[3047.60 - 3054.24] the beyond a new religion it's
[3051.12 - 3057.04] beyond all of that it's
[3054.24 - 3058.16] it's actually like a training a
[3057.04 - 3061.20] conditioning
[3058.16 - 3064.64] that's happening so
[3061.20 - 3068.56] you actually believe that science
[3064.64 - 3071.68] in medicine is above
[3068.56 - 3074.48] board can't do no wrong
[3071.68 - 3075.36] nothing can happen and it's free of
[3074.48 - 3077.12] corruption
[3075.36 - 3079.20] you know there's corruption everywhere
[3077.12 - 3080.88] else right i just told you all those
[3079.20 - 3082.88] different things like what's your fight
[3080.88 - 3085.68] what's your worry what's your concern
[3082.88 - 3086.64] because that's where this you know you
[3085.68 - 3089.04] know
[3086.64 - 3090.64] about all this corruption out there you
[3089.04 - 3091.92] guys are out there you see it you guys
[3090.64 - 3093.60] are on the internet you see different
[3091.92 - 3094.96] things that you know about you guys
[3093.60 - 3096.40] look into things you guys know
[3094.96 - 3098.32] corruption but there's no corruption in
[3096.40 - 3101.52] science no whoa
[3098.32 - 3104.16] whoa all those paid for studies
[3101.52 - 3105.20] paid and funded no thumb on the scale
[3104.16 - 3108.16] right
[3105.20 - 3108.96] you know what i know a lot of scientists
[3108.16 - 3111.12] because
[3108.96 - 3113.04] the years of the work that i've done and
[3111.12 - 3114.16] bringing so much information out there
[3113.04 - 3116.08] to others so i know
[3114.16 - 3117.68] a lot of scientists and guess what they
[3116.08 - 3121.04] can't feed their families
[3117.68 - 3122.16] if they don't produce an outcome if you
[3121.04 - 3125.12] don't produce an
[3122.16 - 3126.16] outcome to the funder that's actually
[3125.12 - 3128.72] hiring you
[3126.16 - 3130.64] and that outcome doesn't suit the funder
[3128.72 - 3132.80] then guess what you never work again
[3130.64 - 3135.36] and you never get hired by another
[3132.80 - 3137.44] funder another company won't hire you
[3135.36 - 3138.88] so guess what that's the last job you
[3137.44 - 3141.60] work you're going to be working
[3138.88 - 3141.60] somewhere else
[3142.00 - 3146.56] a scientist friend of mine said it was
[3143.68 - 3149.12] either working at mcdonald's
[3146.56 - 3150.48] or you better come up with something
[3149.12 - 3152.00] whether you got to pull it out of your
[3150.48 - 3154.16] ass you better come up with something
[3152.00 - 3156.32] because when you're getting funded and
[3154.16 - 3158.48] that's a corporation that's funding you
[3156.32 - 3160.24] and you're like oh crap i gotta come up
[3158.48 - 3162.40] with something on this table
[3160.24 - 3164.32] let me get the chemistry out let me get
[3162.40 - 3165.28] my theories going here because i better
[3164.32 - 3168.24] come up with something
[3165.28 - 3169.44] and if you botch it up you get a bad
[3168.24 - 3172.16] recommendation
[3169.44 - 3174.48] that corporation doesn't want to refer
[3172.16 - 3176.24] you as a scientist anymore to another
[3174.48 - 3177.44] corporation to keep you going so you
[3176.24 - 3181.12] could feed your family
[3177.44 - 3182.56] and now now you're working for like a
[3181.12 - 3183.84] car service and you're driving people
[3182.56 - 3184.64] around and they're in the back seat of
[3183.84 - 3188.08] your car
[3184.64 - 3190.40] when you were the scientist before
[3188.08 - 3194.72] even though that's it's all good i mean
[3190.40 - 3195.28] whatever you do is great you guys know i
[3194.72 - 3198.48] talk about
[3195.28 - 3202.16] medical medium book what
[3198.48 - 3205.60] i did growing up and you guys should
[3202.16 - 3210.48] read the origins of medical medium
[3205.60 - 3210.48] when i was 14 and 15 i used to pump gas
[3212.08 - 3219.76] medical science doesn't
[3216.08 - 3221.52] get called out so it never gets called
[3219.76 - 3222.40] out it makes mistake after mistake after
[3221.52 - 3224.64] mistake
[3222.40 - 3226.56] it's your genes it's the biggest mistake
[3224.64 - 3228.64] ever but it doesn't matter it'll never
[3226.56 - 3229.68] get called out you'll buy it you'll buy
[3228.64 - 3231.76] into it
[3229.68 - 3232.80] you know anything that has the word
[3231.76 - 3236.08] science now
[3232.80 - 3237.12] and forget it it's platinum gold you
[3236.08 - 3240.64] can't
[3237.12 - 3242.00] you can't go near it it's diamonds and
[3240.64 - 3243.76] they'll tell your body's attacking
[3242.00 - 3244.24] itself so when you got hashimoto's and
[3243.76 - 3247.76] you got
[3244.24 - 3249.60] ra and you got multiple sclerosis and
[3247.76 - 3250.16] you got fibromyalgia you got cfs and
[3249.60 - 3251.44] you've got
[3250.16 - 3252.96] all kinds of other problems they're
[3251.44 - 3254.48] going to tell you your body's attacking
[3252.96 - 3255.36] itself because science wants to blame
[3254.48 - 3258.56] your body
[3255.36 - 3260.00] it's body shaming so they want your
[3258.56 - 3262.00] children body shamed
[3260.00 - 3263.04] thinking their genes are bad and faulty
[3262.00 - 3265.36] that's a real
[3263.04 - 3266.32] hard pill to swallow right there they
[3265.36 - 3267.92] want
[3266.32 - 3270.40] you and your children to believe that
[3267.92 - 3271.92] your body's attacking itself
[3270.40 - 3273.76] they want you to believe that you have
[3271.92 - 3274.56] all these gene mutations and that's why
[3273.76 - 3276.08] you're sick
[3274.56 - 3277.68] and they want you if you're a woman they
[3276.08 - 3278.48] want you to believe it's your hormones a
[3277.68 - 3280.16] hundred percent
[3278.48 - 3283.12] yeah our hormones are imbalanced and you
[3280.16 - 3285.04] you should get a really good doctor
[3283.12 - 3287.04] a really good doctor and have them do
[3285.04 - 3288.88] some hormone testing absolutely
[3287.04 - 3291.20] and they can offer something natural
[3288.88 - 3294.72] that can really help
[3291.20 - 3297.68] but but they blame science wants
[3294.72 - 3300.64] everything blamed on hormones everything
[3297.68 - 3302.64] blamed on hormones
[3300.64 - 3303.92] and that's what they want science
[3302.64 - 3305.84] doesn't want you to know that it's a
[3303.92 - 3307.20] toxic heavy metal against the viruses
[3305.84 - 3308.56] and the shingles virus and the
[3307.20 - 3309.92] epstein-barr
[3308.56 - 3311.76] and all the different varieties in the
[3309.92 - 3313.12] streptococcus and they want
[3311.76 - 3314.56] they don't want you knowing the real
[3313.12 - 3315.84] problems of why your hormones are
[3314.56 - 3317.52] imbalanced they don't want to look for
[3315.84 - 3321.92] the real issues
[3317.52 - 3325.84] science doesn't want to do that medical
[3321.92 - 3328.08] science you know
[3325.84 - 3330.56] doesn't care about you medical science
[3328.08 - 3332.08] looks out for medical science
[3330.56 - 3334.64] that's how it works i mean it's
[3332.08 - 3336.48] something to keep keep an eye on
[3334.64 - 3338.24] you might not believe that now but if
[3336.48 - 3340.16] you're somebody that was sick for 25
[3338.24 - 3343.52] years already you know that
[3340.16 - 3345.52] that's the way it goes the best science
[3343.52 - 3347.52] doesn't get people out of bed it doesn't
[3345.52 - 3348.00] get people off of mattress island when
[3347.52 - 3351.68] it comes
[3348.00 - 3353.84] down to chronic illness you know
[3351.68 - 3356.40] and the best science and then there's
[3353.84 - 3359.04] this you ready for this you guys
[3356.40 - 3359.84] okay here's how it works we need
[3359.04 - 3363.76] scientists
[3359.84 - 3364.48] we need science but the best science out
[3363.76 - 3367.76] there that has
[3364.48 - 3370.88] truth will never be revealed
[3367.76 - 3372.08] it will never get a spotlight it will
[3370.88 - 3375.36] get squashed
[3372.08 - 3378.16] and crushed so if you fund some
[3375.36 - 3380.72] scientists to actually discover the real
[3378.16 - 3384.00] cause of something
[3380.72 - 3384.40] there's going to be literally men in
[3384.00 - 3386.32] black
[3384.40 - 3387.84] suits busting down those doors and
[3386.32 - 3390.96] shutting that down
[3387.84 - 3391.52] you can't you can't fund real science in
[3390.96 - 3393.60] health
[3391.52 - 3395.76] and wellness you can fund science and
[3393.60 - 3399.04] technology like i was telling you before
[3395.76 - 3401.52] and it and it it going good you can fund
[3399.04 - 3403.28] as good as it can you can fund
[3401.52 - 3406.08] technology can fund other things
[3403.28 - 3407.68] but you can't fund science to fix
[3406.08 - 3410.96] problems to really
[3407.68 - 3413.36] know to really discover what's wrong
[3410.96 - 3414.16] because that stuff will be shut down
[3413.36 - 3417.12] fast
[3414.16 - 3418.00] totally shut down because the minute the
[3417.12 - 3419.84] word gets out
[3418.00 - 3423.20] there of why people are really sick it
[3419.84 - 3425.04] leads a trail back to where it came from
[3423.20 - 3426.96] like the epstein-barr virus it leads a
[3425.04 - 3428.56] trail where these viruses really come
[3426.96 - 3430.16] from it leads a trail where these toxic
[3428.56 - 3432.96] heavy metals come from
[3430.16 - 3434.16] and that they can't expose that they
[3432.96 - 3436.64] don't want scientists
[3434.16 - 3438.72] learning how to heal people either
[3436.64 - 3441.84] scientists are not allowed
[3438.72 - 3443.04] to find answers and to work in medical
[3441.84 - 3446.64] science and research
[3443.04 - 3447.60] to actually heal people to actually heal
[3446.64 - 3450.32] people
[3447.60 - 3452.00] because if they do that it defies what
[3450.32 - 3452.80] medical research and science is trying
[3452.00 - 3454.88] to do
[3452.80 - 3456.72] they like creating equipment they like
[3454.88 - 3460.08] creating things
[3456.72 - 3462.56] they like to make things
[3460.08 - 3463.12] and um you know they like to make things
[3462.56 - 3465.20] and stuff
[3463.12 - 3467.60] so science loves to do that where they
[3465.20 - 3468.96] they can put nuts and bolts together
[3467.60 - 3471.52] you know they can help you get more
[3468.96 - 3472.96] comfortable with like if you have a leg
[3471.52 - 3475.44] problem a knee problem they can create
[3472.96 - 3476.08] knee braces science works in those areas
[3475.44 - 3478.00] right
[3476.08 - 3479.92] mechanical and other things like that
[3478.00 - 3481.20] they work with some pharmaceuticals that
[3479.92 - 3482.96] can be helpful
[3481.20 - 3484.56] because they sell that's the thing it's
[3482.96 - 3486.88] all part of that they want to sell all
[3484.56 - 3489.04] that stuff but they don't want
[3486.88 - 3490.64] the real reasons why you're sick and how
[3489.04 - 3494.16] to head that off at the pass
[3490.64 - 3496.24] and how to heal that they don't want
[3494.16 - 3499.28] that happening so really good
[3496.24 - 3501.84] good science doesn't get its day
[3499.28 - 3503.20] it gets crushed every time it wants to
[3501.84 - 3505.52] peek its head out
[3503.20 - 3507.52] so hey wait a minute toxic heavy metals
[3505.52 - 3509.92] are responsible for these diseases
[3507.52 - 3511.20] boom it gets crushed wait a minute this
[3509.92 - 3514.24] you you can't go
[3511.20 - 3516.24] there that's how it works and then
[3514.24 - 3517.52] then there's the fight of two sciences
[3516.24 - 3519.76] right you get people
[3517.52 - 3521.12] where's your science what science are
[3519.76 - 3522.40] you talking about because conventional
[3521.12 - 3523.76] science doesn't believe in alternative
[3522.40 - 3525.44] science
[3523.76 - 3526.96] they don't believe food has any science
[3525.44 - 3527.52] involved there's nothing even involved
[3526.96 - 3529.04] with food
[3527.52 - 3530.40] they don't believe in anything so what
[3529.04 - 3532.32] signs are even talking about whose
[3530.40 - 3534.24] science are you even on or even talking
[3532.32 - 3536.56] about that's a whole other thing too
[3534.24 - 3537.52] and studies are always being trumped on
[3536.56 - 3539.44] studies
[3537.52 - 3540.80] like that study is an old study that
[3539.44 - 3542.40] studies useless
[3540.80 - 3544.56] and then the new study comes out and
[3542.40 - 3547.44] crushes it and then the bias
[3544.56 - 3548.00] the bias in studies is a whole other
[3547.44 - 3551.60] game
[3548.00 - 3552.88] um so yeah yeah yeah susan says forget
[3551.60 - 3555.20] about science right now
[3552.88 - 3557.12] okay well you know what there's millions
[3555.20 - 3560.08] and millions and millions of kids
[3557.12 - 3561.52] that believe science knows everything
[3560.08 - 3563.28] about their health
[3561.52 - 3565.28] and that their genes are faulty and
[3563.28 - 3569.12] their bodies are attacking themselves
[3565.28 - 3570.56] and when hey when mom is driving home
[3569.12 - 3572.88] from a doctor's appointment
[3570.56 - 3574.64] and she's got her 15 year old son and
[3572.88 - 3576.56] he's looking on the computer
[3574.64 - 3578.72] and he's finding out his hashimoto's is
[3576.56 - 3582.48] his body destroying his thyroid
[3578.72 - 3585.20] it's devastating devastating
[3582.48 - 3586.00] because science doesn't have her son's
[3585.20 - 3589.44] back
[3586.00 - 3590.64] or her back so i mean the traps are set
[3589.44 - 3592.64] for you guys
[3590.64 - 3594.08] bottom line celery juice works yeah it
[3592.64 - 3595.84] does um
[3594.08 - 3597.68] so anyway if i don't talk about this
[3595.84 - 3600.88] then you guys will fall into traps
[3597.68 - 3602.64] that's how the system's set up and i let
[3600.88 - 3605.36] you know as what's to come
