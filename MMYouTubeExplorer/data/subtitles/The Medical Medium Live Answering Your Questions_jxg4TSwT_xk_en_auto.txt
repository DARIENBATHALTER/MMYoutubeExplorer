[423.12 - 425.28] know all medical medium information is
[424.64 - 428.16] unique
[425.28 - 429.44] original and from source for 35 years so
[428.16 - 430.72] if you hear bits and pieces of it out
[429.44 - 432.48] there you think it's already been out
[430.72 - 433.84] there like it's crazy like i see people
[432.48 - 437.04] out there saying things like
[433.84 - 439.84] toxic heavy metals cause anxiety
[437.04 - 442.08] dude that only comes from one source
[439.84 - 443.84] there's no research in science that came
[442.08 - 445.12] out with a paper saying metals heavy
[443.84 - 446.40] metals cause anxiety
[445.12 - 448.32] it only comes from medical medium
[446.40 - 449.84] information it always has
[448.32 - 451.52] there's nothing there's no study out
[449.84 - 452.16] there that shows that but yet people
[451.52 - 454.56] like even
[452.16 - 455.20] practitioners out there will say anxiety
[454.56 - 456.40] uh
[455.20 - 458.48] you know metals have something to do
[456.40 - 461.60] with anxiety are you kidding uh
[458.48 - 463.68] that only comes from the source so
[461.60 - 465.84] why don't you cite it please because
[463.68 - 469.52] that's not from a research study paper

[604.40 - 607.20] therapy
[605.28 - 608.40] that we were talking about earlier it's
