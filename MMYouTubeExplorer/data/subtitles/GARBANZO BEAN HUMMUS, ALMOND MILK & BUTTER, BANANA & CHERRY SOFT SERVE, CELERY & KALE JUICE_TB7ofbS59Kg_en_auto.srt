452
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,720

all right

454
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,559
so you don't have to you worry about the

455
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,320
weight gaining too right because that's

456
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,799
a thing everybody's like oh i'm gaining

457
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,919
weight well how much oil how much fat is

458
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,240
in your diet that you have going on

459
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
right

460
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,200
so this is like

461
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
guilt-free

462
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,400
but it's not just that

463
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,000
it's also this is isn't it this isn't

464
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
just that it's not about guilt-free or

465
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
anything it's about keeping your fats

466
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,160
down so your body can heal so if you're

467
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,840
somebody who's chronically ill right if

468
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
you're somebody who's chronically ill

469
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,520
someone who's sick someone who's

470
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,000
struggling keeping the fats low is one

471
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,760
of the ways we move forward because you

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,320
don't bog down the liver you don't bog

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,240
down the immune system so this is a way

474
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,559
to actually heal this is that's why i

475
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,840
call this machine these machines medical

476
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:31,200
devices medical machines

477
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,200
okay and that's what's so great about it

478
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,080
[Music]

479
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
i don't know what that means let me see

480
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
here put this over here

481
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,559
there we go

482
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,400
so i got this beautiful hummus right

483
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
here

484
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,679
how is this better than humans made with

485
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,200
a blender are hummus made with a blender

486
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,000
is elizabeth's saying how is this better

487
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,280
than hummus made with a blender all

488
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,520
right so you can make hummus with a

489
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,200
blender there's no question but when you

490
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,559
do fat free hummus it's hard to get it

491
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
smooth

492
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,640
it's hard to get it smooth and creamy so

493
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
what you have here when you have this

494
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,440
machine the difference is you can get it

495
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,760
smooth and creamy and this is fat free

496
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,160
so there's no oil in here

497
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,919
but yet it's smooth and creamy

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
that's the difference between getting in

499
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
a blender when you put in the blender

500
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
you have to add a big hunk of tahini in

501
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
there too like that's something people

502
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,840
do to try to get it that kind of creamy

503
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,840
texture when you're doing the blender

504
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
you don't have to do that this way

505
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,000
literally we just put the garbanzo beans

506
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,240
the chickpeas right into the machine

507
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,880
and you didn't have the oil you didn't

508
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,799
have all that tahini or olive oil you

509
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,880
know what happens people put ounces and

510
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,919
ounces of olive oil in their hummus at

511
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,200
least the restaurants do you sit down

512
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,000
you know you sit down in the restaurant

513
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,679
you're like yeah can i order a hummus

514
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,840
okay sure yes you can bring me some

515
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,240
crackers too okay thank you they dropped

516
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,840
the hummus down you wouldn't believe how

517
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,360
much olive oil or canola oil is in that

518
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,400
hummus if you couldn't imagine how much

519
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,919
is in there so that's the whole thing so

520
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,120
it's important to know that this is

521
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,880
creamy and smooth this was pulverized in

522
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,360
such an incredible way that that's the

523
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
difference right there

524
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,559
so i hope that answers the question

525
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
right

526
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,159

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,240
it has to be by itself it's herbal

564
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,600
medicine you juice on its own

565
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
but you can also use celery

566
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,559
as

567
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,799
a carrier

568
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,880
and that's a different situation

569
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,760
so what we're doing is we're making a

570
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
kale juice right now

571
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
but we're going to use the trace mineral

572
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
salts and celery

573
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,640
to become the carrier for phytochemical

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,559
compounds

575
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
from the kale

576
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,039
to go deep into the liver and so forth

577
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,960
all right

578
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
so that's important to know so let's do

579
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,480
it so we're not just sitting here making

580
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
celery juice you do your celery juice in

581
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,360
the morning that's what i do i do in the

582
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,120
morning empty stomach 32 ounces that's

583
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,360
what i do

584
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,039
the end of the day this is an option for

585
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,679
people at the end of the day where we

586
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,640
now do a kale juice but we're making

587
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,240
sure celery is the carrier so let's get

588
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
moving on if you guys just got on here

589
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,760

machine boom that's icy cold right there

593
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,120
we got a carrot puree baby food and

594
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,799

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,240
hummus

599
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,120
with this machine now we're making kale

600
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,480
celery juice

601
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,559
let's do it

602
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,000
we're on

603
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,240
so i'm gonna run some kale through here

604
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,240
right now

605
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,320
this is beautiful kale i have right here

606
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
gorgeous you guys on tick-tock

607
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,640
you've entered the twilight zone

608
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,279
guys on telegram you guys are in the

609
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,279
matrix

610
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
okay

611
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,120
this is where we take health to like

612
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,400
always the new level right

613
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,400
mimi says

614
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,200
can we add an apple to the kale and

615
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,600
celery does that reduce the nutrition

616
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,240
you can add an apple to it because

617
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,240
you're not doing celery by itself

618
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
anymore

619
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,200
telegram you guys have entered the

620
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,440
matrix

621
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,679
tick-tock we're in the twilight zone

622
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,679
right now

623
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,200
so what i'm doing right now is using

624
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,440
celery as a carrier

625
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
okay

626
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,120
i'm using the trace mineral salts in

627
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,600
celery which is an herb to carry

628
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,480
the phytochemical compounds

629
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,480
of the kale

630
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,400
so kale

631
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,039

let's kind of get a grip let's get a

645
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,559
grip here

646
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
before i start talking a little too

647
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480

648
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,559

guys

651
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,799
all right

652
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
what you're doing is

653
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,400
you're you're you're using herbal

654
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,760
medicine so this is important to know

655
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,279
for so many people here when you're

656
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,480
dealing with celery you're dealing with

657
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
herbal medicine

658
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,039
herbal medicine that's easy on the body

659
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,159
easy on the system easy on the

660
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,320
intestinal tract lining easy on

661
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,080
everything this is different when we go

662
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,679
and try to take all this crazy stuff

663
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,440
that someone recommends and we try to

664
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,520
take something else and we just burn a

665
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,440
hole through our gut

666
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,320
that's not what this is right this is

667
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,120
herbal medicine that really turns things

668
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,720
around inside of us but we're using this

669
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,400
herbal medicine

670
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,840
to do something for us we're using this

671
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,640
okay

672
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,679
right we're using this to do something

673
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,640
to give us something else so what we're

674
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,360
doing

675
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,039
is we're using the celery

676
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:58,000
to bind onto

677
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,240
to carry phytochemical compounds in that

678
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,799
leafy green so you're looking at those

679
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,960
leafy greens

680
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,840
that's what that's what we're doing

681
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,840
it's important to know

682
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,039
and i want to show you about this how

683
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,640
the juicer works a little bit too with

684
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,799
this you're seeing dry pulp come out

685
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,600
see that's dry that's because this has a

686
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,720
celery end cap so you're seeing the dry

687
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,520
pulp come out just like the mm-900

688
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,760
which is my favorite juicer the mm-900

689
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,679
but you're seeing the dry pulp come out

690
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,000
and tick-tock

691
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,600
the reason why this is the twilight zone

692
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,960
right now is because that pulp is

693
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,039
supposed to be so sloppy wet

694
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,919
that it's supposed to even be filling

695
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,159
juice in that container and that's money

696
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,279
out the door money out the window

697
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,760
sandy says where do you find the

698
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,279
discount for the m for the 1500 hit the

699
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,880
link right there link is in the

700
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,159
description

701
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,279
well right where it takes you to there

702
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,799
it should show you how much you've

703
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,799
gotten off 80 off

704
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,840
so i'm running some more kale through

705
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
here

706
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
so you're witnessing

707
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,399
you're witnessing dry pulp coming out of

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,120
this machine

709
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,559
that's dollars going in your pocket

710
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,640
right there so that's dollars going in

711
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,960
your pocket the one thing about the mm

712
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,279
1500 and the mm-900 is they pay for

713
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,679
themselves over time they actually pay

714
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,760
for themselves and that's the difference

715
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,760
with these two machines they pay for

716
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
themselves

717
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
so we're running a little bit more

718
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,039
celery through here we're running kale

719
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,799
through here i'm running a celery stick

720
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,600
in here then i'm running kale through

721
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,399
here

722
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,480
and i'm doing a blend right here

723
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:49,520
i'm using the celery herb

724
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,159
the herb as a carrier

725
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,840
and what you're seeing is dry pulp

726
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,840
popping out

727
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,120
another thing

728
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,039
you're seeing

729
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,919
is there isn't metal

730
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,559
now all involved in there like the other

731
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,520
juicers were all that metal particles

732
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,760
from the metal gears doing this and

733
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,200
central fuse all the metal you're not

734
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,080
seeing that either which is amazing

735
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,320
all right

736
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,320
so

737
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,520
we're running kale we're running some

738
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
celery through here

739
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,799
now you're seeing that dry pulp come out

740
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
right you guys

741
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,960
there it is now listen don't get me

742
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,520
wrong you can take the mm-900

743
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,159
and still run kale

744
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,159
and cilantro with your celery through it

745
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,000
here we go but here's the thing with

746
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,520
inflation and food costs

747
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,720
this is helping

748
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,840
that's what i love about it with

749
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,320

now whole foods organic celery price

755

inflation from 1.79 to 299 i save a

756
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,320
bunch of money using the mm juicer

757
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,960
that's the whole point food costs go up

758
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,000
the juicer is extracting more

759
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,039
it's less there's less moisture in the

760
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
pulp

761
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,880

762
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,520

okay so let's let's just show you how

765
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,720
this works

766
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,559
so that's the pulp

767
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,799

768
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,720

779
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,399
it's like you don't know where you are

780
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,000
but check this out right here

781
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,279
trying to get lined up with the camera

782
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,200
if you guys see this you don't see

783
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
liquid coming out of my hand

784
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,480
is someone trying to read my spirit said

785
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,840
someone's trying to read my palm

786
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
unbelievable

787
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,039
that's interesting

788
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,679
spirit of compassion just told me that

789
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,880
someone out there is actually trying to

790
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,840
read my bomb lines

791
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,000
i know i never had that happen

792
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,159
you're probably a gifted palm reader too

793
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,559
just just don't just don't see anything

794
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,080
in my palm that's scary please like you

795
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,200
know what i mean like they're finally

796
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,360
gonna they're finally gonna get them

797
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,360
they're finally gonna get them

798
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,039
or he's gonna work himself to death and

799
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,960
then he's just he's gonna die because

800
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,559
he's gonna he's gonna work himself to

801
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,600
the point where he burns a candle six

802
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,679
ends seven eight ends instead of one end

803
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
both ends all right

804
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
so the point is you don't see liquid

805
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,600
coming out

806
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,200
someone was trying to read my palm lines

807
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,519
that's what spirit of compassion just

808
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,600
said and i'm impressed that was that was

809
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,840
smart that was smart of someone trying

810
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,679
to do that

811
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,080
okay so what you're seeing in my palm

812
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,200
now is you're seeing pulp

813
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,880
that's drier than the other juicers that

814
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,840
means you get more of that celery juice

815
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,480
more of that kale juice

816
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,960
that's when you buy kale and you squeeze

817
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,559
every last bit out of it to use it as

818
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,720
medicine someone said i'll just eat the

819
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,399
kale leaf okay that's smart you eat one

820
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
kale leaf two carrot leaves four kilo

821
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,320
leaves five but that's not gonna cut it

822
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,559
you're not going to extract what you

823
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,200
need to extract out of that kale like

824
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,960
you can with the juicer right

825
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,480
but here's the thing this is such a

826
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,720
pulverizer this is a cold pressed

827
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,640
machine with such a pulverizer that

828
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,480
you're getting that out of there

829
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,080
right and you see there's no liquid

830
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,600
pouring into my hand and i've seen some

831
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,919
juicers out there with just it's almost

832
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,799
like what

833
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,720
so

834
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,960
w smith said there's no link for the

835
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,640
juicer juicers the link should be in the

836
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,720
description i'm pretty sure link is in

837
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,679
the description and it's the mm-1500

838
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,279
megajuicers.com mm-1500

839
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,120
i wonder what someone's thinking when

840
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,519
they're trying to read my pump they're

841
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,519
probably like whoa

842
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,519
whoa

843
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,559
yeah okay so we got it we got it we're

844
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,480
going to move on we got a lot to cover

845
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,080
right now so that's what we have to do

846
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,760
so let's get moving on a little bit

847
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,640
so i'm going to get this juice in a

848
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,640
container now

849
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
right

850
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
spirit of compassion also said someone's

851
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,080
falling asleep on me right now

852
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,919
someone's watching and they're falling

853
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,080
asleep they didn't sleep good last night

854
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,000
and they're falling asleep right now

855
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,880
maybe i can tell a bedtime story well

856
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,880
there once was

857
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,200
there was a magical lake

858
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,399
in that magical lake a whole bunch of

859
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,159
mermaids

860
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,679
were swimming out

861
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,159
and then a sea monster came along

862
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,159
and then

863
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,640
but somebody's falling asleep okay there

864
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,640

was i used celery as a tool in a

874
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,359
different way i used it as a carrier

875
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720

876
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,720

phytochemical compounds of the kale and

879
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,159
to carry that

880
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,480

being made now

1088
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,280

1172
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,000
much fat is in almond milk well here's

1173
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,000
the problem almond milk is in the store

1174
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,119
they add oil to it

1175
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,079
to enrich in it so they add oil to the

1176
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,480
almond milk you buy in the store

1177
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,240
so that's added oil which is leading us

1178
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,839
to the next place

1179
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,760
we're gonna make

1180
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,599

1181
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,920
and that's next so i'm really excited

1182
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,359
about that

1183
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,359

1215
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,400
and said

1216
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,280
well wait a minute now

1217
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,960
all that all the oil you see in the nut

1218
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,599
butter you know like

1219
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,599
you know the oil that's mixed up and and

1220
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,520
floating at the top of a nut butter in a

1221
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,000
jar all that oil you see isn't added oil

1222
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,319
it's because the nuts were heated or

1223
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,680
roasted so i got some roasted nuts right

1224
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,680
here

1225
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,960
so i'm kind of curious

1226
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,920
is these roasted nuts gonna create like

1227
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,920
four ounces like two ounces

1228
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,319
right is it going to create like two

1229
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,000
ounces of

1230
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,400
of oil

1231
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,079
that float on the top and make it so

1232
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
it's like that so we're going to take a

1233
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,520
look we're going to do some

1234
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,520
that's really cool

1235
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,839
split screen was really cool all right

1236
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,839
let's go let's make them almond butter

1237
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,680
now when you buy an almond butter

1238
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,440
you have to know

1239
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,240
they add oil

1240
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,240
so if they say their almonds comes from

1241
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,800

in europe whatever they say the oil they

1247
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,440
add to it is from a different place it's

1248
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,040
not from those nuts so it's like you get

1249
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:29,200
this cheaper bulk grade oil that they

1250
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,839

missing on the store in the store when

1340
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,440
you go to the store so you walk into any

1341
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,720
of your health food stores and you buy a

1342
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,960

nuts and they give you more rancid oil

1350
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,200
so they add all this oil they give you

1351
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,640
less nuts and they add all this oil

how come i can't drip all the oil out

1438
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,720
because there's because the system is

1439
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,480
rigged

1440
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,760
in the nut butter world

1441
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,720
it's rigged

1442
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,760
they

1443
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,680
cut corners they remove the nuts

1444
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,760
they give you some nuts

1445
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,280
and then they add all the oil that's

1446
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,040
bulk and cheap

1447
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,119
and they mix it

1448
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,359
and then you get the jar

1449
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,520
and it's half oil mixed in with whatever

1450
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:39,440
nut butter that is in there the oils

1451
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,400
