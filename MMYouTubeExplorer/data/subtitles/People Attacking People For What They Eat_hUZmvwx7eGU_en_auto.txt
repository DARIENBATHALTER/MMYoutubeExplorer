[71.32 - 76.24] food whole bunch of food that a lot of
[73.12 - 78.52] people do eat a lot of people don't eat
[76.24 - 82.68] right what does it matter we shouldn't
[78.52 - 87.28] hate them we shouldn't hate
[82.68 - 90.96] people but people do people attack
[87.28 - 93.44] people people attack people and then
[90.96 - 95.64] people attack people and then people
[93.44 - 98.44] attack people you haven't seen it I'm
[95.64 - 100.36] not talking about trolls on social media
[98.44 - 104.16] I'm not talking about bots on social
[100.36 - 106.92] media I'm talking about just people in
[104.16 - 108.44] general they attack people and other
[106.92 - 110.44] people attack people and what comes down
[108.44 - 114.08] to it is judgment on food it's all about
[110.44 - 116.56] judging people about what they're eating
[114.08 - 118.96] and what they're doing but really what
[116.56 - 121.72] it's all cracked up to be or what it all
[118.96 - 123.92] amounts to is is two sides of the aisle
[121.72 - 126.28] that's what it amounts to so food Wars
[123.92 - 130.44] means there's a war between the
[126.28 - 135.24] plant-based vegan movement against the
[130.44 - 138.16] animal eating movement the animal
[135.24 - 140.84] eaters they judge and hate the
[138.16 - 145.00] plant-based eaters the plant-based
[140.84 - 147.84] eaters judge and hate the animal eaters
[145.00 - 151.76] that's the food Wars and then the whole
[147.84 - 153.72] bunch of crap in between Queen and
[151.76 - 155.40] everybody's also dabbling and flipping
[153.72 - 157.12] over and everything else here flipping
[155.40 - 159.24] over there flip flopping there flip
[157.12 - 160.44] flopping there so everybody's doing all
[159.24 - 163.08] of that
[160.44 - 164.60] too and then when it comes down to
[163.08 - 165.84] people being sick that takes us to
[164.60 - 167.20] another level which we're going to talk
[165.84 - 168.52] about as well people with chronic
[167.20 - 170.40] illness people who are suffering and
[168.52 - 172.52] struggling and where that leads them
[170.40 - 176.44] when it comes down to eating and what
[172.52 - 177.72] kind of eating where and what and how
[176.44 - 180.84] you don't want to miss this episode
[177.72 - 182.44] let's cut right into it now okay now I
[180.84 - 184.00] don't know what side of the ID aisle
[182.44 - 186.48] you're on you might be on the
[184.00 - 188.88] plant-based aisle you might be on the
[186.48 - 190.28] animal protein aisle maybe you're
[188.88 - 192.64] somewhere in
[190.28 - 194.60] between but years and years and years
[192.64 - 197.32] ago there used to be just a small amount
[194.60 - 201.36] of plant-based people it's so small like
[197.32 - 203.60] a grain of rice to a silo of rice and
[201.36 - 206.72] The Silo of rice is the animal eaters
[203.60 - 209.32] right or a grain of sand on the beach
[206.72 - 210.28] would be the plant-based movement vegan
[209.32 - 212.40] movement
[210.28 - 215.08] and then the rest of the beach filled
[212.40 - 218.36] with sand tons and tons and tons of sand
[215.08 - 221.24] would be the animal eating movement an
[218.36 - 224.04] animal eaters right so that's what it
[221.24 - 226.48] used to be and then over time the vegan
[224.04 - 228.52] movement got a little bigger and a
[226.48 - 230.04] little bigger and there was a vegetarian
[228.52 - 231.84] movement in the middle but remember the
[230.04 - 233.72] vegetarians just ate basically
[231.84 - 237.24] everything except for red meat so
[233.72 - 240.08] vegetarians ate everything except for
[237.24 - 243.24] red meat that's what the old days was
[240.08 - 246.32] like by the way so they ate cheese
[243.24 - 249.44] vegetarians ate cheese they drank milk
[246.32 - 251.96] they ate every o yogurt they did
[249.44 - 253.08] everything ate fish and then the only
[251.96 - 254.72] thing they didn't do is like I'm
[253.08 - 256.68] vegetarian you know what does that mean
[254.72 - 258.36] oh I can still eat everything except
[256.68 - 260.12] meat right the vegetarians you guys
[258.36 - 262.52] remember that whole thing there's a few
[260.12 - 265.12] of those old dogs out there there are
[262.52 - 266.84] there's a few of those old dogs left
[265.12 - 269.88] right where they're eating everything
[266.84 - 272.48] eggs dairy cheese milk butter they're
[269.88 - 275.08] eating everything all of it and they're
[272.48 - 277.28] like but I don't eat red meat you know
[275.08 - 279.28] the vegetarian thing am I just like
[277.28 - 280.80] entertaining myself on that I mean think
[279.28 - 282.96] about that that's really funny do you
[280.80 - 284.24] guys remember and there might be a
[282.96 - 288.28] couple of you guys who are still doing
[284.24 - 291.40] that but overall okay the vegan movement
[288.28 - 295.04] grew and it grew and it grew a little
[291.40 - 298.56] bit more a little bit more okay and then
[295.04 - 300.48] as it grew all
[298.56 - 302.60] right
[300.48 - 305.44] a bunch of vegans and plant-based people
[302.60 - 308.84] that were in the movement decided to run
[305.44 - 310.44] back to animal base and then the animal
[308.84 - 312.24] based movement is interesting because
[310.44 - 313.92] it's changing and changing where people
[312.24 - 314.96] are trying keto then they're trying low
[313.92 - 317.76] carb then they're trying all these
[314.96 - 319.84] different things and then there flipping
[317.76 - 322.36] over to vegan for a little while but
[319.84 - 325.96] it's become like a dabbling situation
[322.36 - 328.48] where it's a blend a h Posh of everybody
[325.96 - 331.56] pretty much eating anything at any time
[328.48 - 333.00] now there are some staunch vegans out
[331.56 - 335.04] there still left and there are some
[333.00 - 338.40] staunch plant- paced people still left
[335.04 - 340.56] out there sure but for the most part
[338.40 - 343.20] most vegans and most vegans and
[340.56 - 345.32] plant-based people they just went boom
[343.20 - 346.96] into eggs they went back into eggs and
[345.32 - 348.16] back into cheese and they go into that
[346.96 - 350.04] for a while and then they say I got to
[348.16 - 352.28] be plant-based again for like a week or
[350.04 - 353.72] two I have to someday then a year later
[352.28 - 356.40] they're plant-based for a little while
[353.72 - 357.96] or they're vegan for a little while and
[356.40 - 359.56] then boom they're back to eating animal
[357.96 - 360.76] products do you know anybody like this
[359.56 - 362.04] back to eating animal products then
[360.76 - 363.04] they're back to being plant-based
[362.04 - 364.96] because they're like you know I need to
[363.04 - 366.20] go plant-based I need to clean things up
[364.96 - 368.52] I need to and then they're back to
[366.20 - 371.32] eating my animal products right and then
[368.52 - 373.04] there's a lot of Animal product people
[371.32 - 374.40] they're like I'm going to go vegan for a
[373.04 - 376.68] while I'm going to try it out they try
[374.40 - 377.92] it for a year something happens where
[376.68 - 380.56] they were doing good for a little while
[377.92 - 382.04] then something flips a switch Clicks in
[380.56 - 383.56] maybe they get a symptom they don't feel
[382.04 - 386.28] good maybe somebody told them they need
[383.56 - 388.24] protein you need protein you need more
[386.28 - 390.36] protein they freak out they freak out
[388.24 - 393.00] boom they're back to animal
[390.36 - 394.72] products and then there's pressure peer
[393.00 - 397.40] pressure from friends and peer pressure
[394.72 - 399.80] from family peer pressure from the
[397.40 - 401.72] internet telling you you should be going
[399.80 - 403.64] one way or another and then someone
[401.72 - 405.76] chimes in it's like this and this and
[403.64 - 408.12] this and everybody gets
[405.76 - 411.32] confused it's the wild west out there
[408.12 - 413.48] still till this day and really
[411.32 - 415.20] everybody's flip-flopping and not
[413.48 - 417.00] certain where they want to go and what
[415.20 - 420.12] they want to do because they might be
[417.00 - 422.56] vegan or vegetarian or S vegan
[420.12 - 426.16] and plant-based for a couple of
[422.56 - 428.44] years and then they're back to dabbling
[426.16 - 431.20] into animal stuff they're over there and
[428.44 - 433.60] the animal stuff all over again right
[431.20 - 436.84] and that's what they do and the same
[433.60 - 439.04] thing goes for animal as well but the
[436.84 - 442.08] vegans and the plant-based people have
[439.04 - 446.04] it harder than the animal people because
[442.08 - 449.00] the animal people usually stay animal
[446.04 - 451.08] for the most part don't really flip that
[449.00 - 452.64] much into vegan vegetarian or
[451.08 - 456.12] plant-based
[452.64 - 459.24] long but the plant-based people take the
[456.12 - 462.28] most heat they take the most heat still
[459.24 - 465.56] till this day and they're desperate for
[462.28 - 467.96] science to somehow some way back them up
[465.56 - 471.44] and support them so they can shove that
[467.96 - 473.64] science right up the animal eater asses
[471.44 - 476.84] and that's what they try and want to do
[473.64 - 480.04] desperately out there is the plant-based
[476.84 - 483.56] movement are desperate for science and
[480.04 - 485.76] have been forever it's like a desert and
[483.56 - 487.60] a drop of water falls into the desert
[485.76 - 490.36] and that drop of water is there's
[487.60 - 492.44] protein in Spinach there's protein in
[490.36 - 495.28] Greens I'm going to go to all those
[492.44 - 497.20] animal protein people and scream it out
[495.28 - 499.76] screaming out to them there's protein in
[497.20 - 502.68] this there's protein in this there's
[499.76 - 504.48] protein in this and the plant-based
[502.68 - 506.32] people and the vegan people kind of
[504.48 - 508.76] picked it up from the old vegetarian
[506.32 - 511.00] people that stopped eating red meat that
[508.76 - 513.52] Fe felt like they were getting their
[511.00 - 516.60] protein from their soy or their
[513.52 - 519.12] tofu and their tofu and their soy beans
[516.60 - 521.08] were giving them protein so they always
[519.12 - 523.40] felt like I'm getting my textured
[521.08 - 526.72] protein I'm getting that protein in some
[523.40 - 529.20] way Gina says over there on Facebook
[526.72 - 531.52] this is so true a friend of 20 years
[529.20 - 534.72] posted a nasty video about plant-based
[531.52 - 538.72] eating that was directed towards me I
[534.72 - 539.64] was like what the F this is important to
[538.72 - 541.00] understand when you're you're struggling
[539.64 - 543.60] with chronic illness so I want you to
[541.00 - 546.80] know this isn't just this isn't just a
[543.60 - 548.16] rant on you know what you eat what you
[546.80 - 550.52] don't eat what's going on on the
[548.16 - 552.68] internet I I'm not trying to do that
[550.52 - 555.00] today what I'm trying to tell you is
[552.68 - 556.48] when you're chronically sick that's when
[555.00 - 558.12] everything shifts and we're going to get
[556.48 - 560.68] into that this is why this is so
[558.12 - 563.04] important right here
[560.68 - 564.84] okay so the plant-based people in the
[563.04 - 568.12] vegan people I find this really
[564.84 - 570.36] interesting you guys they're
[568.12 - 573.00] desperate
[570.36 - 574.16] desperate for Science and they have been
[573.00 - 577.20] for
[574.16 - 579.48] years because they somehow need to tell
[577.20 - 582.00] all their doctors and all their family
[579.48 - 584.72] doctors that I can be plant-based and I
[582.00 - 587.56] can be vegan and here's some science
[584.72 - 590.80] right here doctor

[677.08 - 681.44] best okay let's go into it a little bit
[678.64 - 683.56] food Wars we hear moderation often as
[681.44 - 685.88] advice about food itself we don't see a
[683.56 - 687.56] lot of moderation in how people debate
[685.88 - 689.48] about food it's very common to see
[687.56 - 691.92] people go to extremes and Def in their
[689.48 - 693.52] chosen food belief system and one thing
[691.92 - 696.20] I'll tell you right now this is
[693.52 - 699.16] incredible the plant-based and the vegan
[696.20 - 701.48] movement on the animal based movement
[699.16 - 705.36] think they're so far apart they think
[701.48 - 710.28] they're so different from each other
[705.36 - 713.56] they believe they are opposite people
[710.28 - 715.32] opposite Everything But the irony is
[713.56 - 717.76] they're closer to each other than
[715.32 - 719.60] anybody knows and the irony is they're
[717.76 - 722.12] more alike
[719.60 - 725.20] than anybody can ever
[722.12 - 726.96] imagine and they're very similar in so
[725.20 - 729.80] many ways we're going to cover that that
[726.96 - 731.24] anyone ever imagines imagined either if
[729.80 - 733.20] you guys just got in here just quickly

[770.24 - 776.12] it if you're somebody who's chronically
[772.88 - 778.40] sick that's when we're susceptible to

[778.40 - 782.96] that's going going on the war that
[780.52 - 785.32] ensues right now with the plant-based
[782.96 - 786.88] people against the animal-based people
[785.32 - 789.48] the animal based people against the
[786.88 - 791.52] plant-based people they don't care who
[789.48 - 794.40] gets hurt in the middle and they don't
[791.52 - 796.92] care who gets hurt in any way possible
[794.40 - 800.16] this is important to know they're just
[796.92 - 803.24] so gung-ho and stuck on their darn food
[800.16 - 805.76] belief system it doesn't matter if you
[803.24 - 808.92] get confused or you get persuaded into a
[805.76 - 812.20] different direction or you get hurt that
[808.92 - 817.40] doesn't matter because no one
[812.20 - 820.08] cares let me repeat no one freaking
[817.40 - 822.64] cares that's how it
[820.08 - 825.12] works because right now there's this
[822.64 - 827.28] like industry war going on right now
[825.12 - 829.68] okay and it's all about the money money
[827.28 - 831.76] money money it's all about the ching
[829.68 - 835.32] ching ching is what's happening right
[831.76 - 839.00] now okay so you got the plantas vegan
[835.32 - 841.40] people and they're just rising up trying
[839.00 - 842.68] to sell [ __ ] 24/7 in programs and
[841.40 - 844.52] courses and everything else rightfully
[842.68 - 846.64] so everybody's doing that just sell sell
[844.52 - 848.64] sell sell sell they got the food belief
[846.64 - 850.48] system they think they figured it all
[848.64 - 852.36] out they think they got it down out
[850.48 - 855.00] there and they're out there and they're
[852.36 - 856.36] screaming their their their their Roar
[855.00 - 858.64] screaming the Roar and you got the
[856.36 - 861.04] animal based people and they're like
[858.64 - 862.72] boom trainers and fitness trainers and
[861.04 - 864.20] boom protein and everything else and
[862.72 - 865.84] they're rising up and they're selling
[864.20 - 867.32] everything under the sun and they're
[865.84 - 869.56] doing this and this but what you'll find
[867.32 - 872.28] out that many of the people that are
[869.56 - 875.08] making the most noise are the least sick
[872.28 - 878.64] they are not in a place where they ever
[875.08 - 880.68] got sick enough yet they just partially
[878.64 - 883.24] got sick for a little while cleaned up
[880.68 - 885.16] their diet and thought they discovered
[883.24 - 886.56] Atlantis I want to read something for
[885.16 - 889.00] you right now and I'm a medical medium
[886.56 - 892.48] brain saer get it free at the library if
[889.00 - 895.00] you want looking for Atlantis one reason
[892.48 - 898.32] to not so sick can find it so hard to
[895.00 - 901.32] understand the sick ready because even
[898.32 - 903.20] though they experienced limits in their
[901.32 - 905.32] health to some degree with conventional
[903.20 - 907.76] medicine they haven't experienced being
[905.32 - 911.76] really sick where alternative medicine
[907.76 - 914.40] is not helping them where holistic
[911.76 - 917.16] medicine functional medicine alternative
[914.40 - 919.00] medicine hasn't helped them and that's
[917.16 - 921.04] the problem what people don't realize
[919.00 - 924.64] okay the people making the most noise
[921.04 - 928.16] out there haven't been sick enough yet
[924.64 - 931.36] chronically ill enough to understand
[928.16 - 934.08] that even even alternative medicine has
[931.36 - 936.48] limitations holistic medicine
[934.08 - 939.92] alternative medicine
[936.48 - 942.32] intergrative medicine has
[939.92 - 944.40] limitations and so what happens that the
[942.32 - 947.72] people screaming out there on both sides
[944.40 - 951.76] of this aisle of plant-based and vegan
[947.72 - 953.68] then animal protein right both sides
[951.76 - 955.36] right of the aisle they're taking all
[953.68 - 958.20] kinds of signs that they're desperate to
[955.36 - 959.84] fling at the other side and post and put
[958.20 - 961.88] out there there and scream in people's
[959.84 - 964.00] ears they're desperate to throw their
[961.88 - 966.08] Sciences back at each other over and
[964.00 - 968.44] over again they're desperate to say you
[966.08 - 970.52] shouldn't be eating animal protein and
[968.44 - 972.80] you should be eating animal protein and
[970.52 - 975.44] it's back and forth and they're into
[972.80 - 977.92] that whole thing we'll go into it
[975.44 - 980.00] deeper and what you'll find is these
[977.92 - 983.84] people screaming and part of the
[980.00 - 986.44] industry now are hobbyists that never
[983.84 - 988.08] got sick yet and when they do get sick
[986.44 - 990.24] everything changes but they never got
[988.08 - 991.48] reled sick yet this is an important
[990.24 - 994.52] piece of all of
[991.48 - 996.72] it for example the not so sick that's
[994.52 - 998.72] what they are may know that the ant
[996.72 - 1001.76] asset given to them at the conventional
[998.72 - 1004.56] doctor's office didn't work they know
[1001.76 - 1006.88] that and they know that they can maybe
[1004.56 - 1008.92] take some apple cider vinegar shots and
[1006.88 - 1011.88] see if that could make their problem go
[1008.92 - 1014.04] away in alternative medicine they know
[1011.88 - 1016.60] that if they get rid of some some
[1014.04 - 1018.52] processed food some fried greasy Foods
[1016.60 - 1020.84] or whatever they know that if they get
[1018.52 - 1022.88] get rid of some of the junk Foods they
[1020.84 - 1024.52] get rid of some of the pizza that they
[1022.88 - 1026.80] can start feeling good maybe they can do
[1024.52 - 1029.40] a little bit of intermittent fasting and
[1026.80 - 1031.24] they can start picking the pace up and
[1029.40 - 1033.64] they're feeling better and they think
[1031.24 - 1035.56] they found the Holy Grail they think
[1033.64 - 1038.08] they found
[1035.56 - 1040.84] Atlantis so people in the plant-based
[1038.08 - 1042.88] movement and vegan movement know that an
[1040.84 - 1044.52] anti-acid maybe didn't help them at the
[1042.88 - 1046.00] conventional doctor's office but yet
[1044.52 - 1048.92] they found a little bit of intermittent
[1046.00 - 1050.76] fasting get rid of pizzas every day and
[1048.92 - 1052.52] clean things up a little bit get
[1050.76 - 1056.64] exercising a little bit more and now
[1052.52 - 1059.36] they are a guru now they're a guru same
[1056.64 - 1061.12] thing in the the animal-based People Too
[1059.36 - 1063.12] cut your carbs down a little get rid of
[1061.12 - 1065.68] the fried greasy
[1063.12 - 1067.40] Foods maybe they'll do some carnivore
[1065.68 - 1069.12] stuff I'll do some carnivore stuff where
[1067.40 - 1071.72] I pretty much get rid of everything that
[1069.12 - 1073.84] is bad for me and then I'll just focus
[1071.72 - 1075.84] on some mono eating some chicken for
[1073.84 - 1078.72] like a week and then I'm starting to
[1075.84 - 1081.04] feel a little bit better and then boom I
[1078.72 - 1083.48] found the Holy Grail I found Atlantis
[1081.04 - 1085.88] deep underneath the ocean the bottom of
[1083.48 - 1088.04] the ocean I found Atlantis but what you
[1085.88 - 1090.04] have to understand is they were never
[1088.04 - 1093.60] really that sick to begin with so now
[1090.04 - 1095.44] they're gurus though I'm Guru I'm a guru
[1093.60 - 1097.08] now I figured it all out I did a little
[1095.44 - 1099.88] intermittent fasting for a month I
[1097.08 - 1101.72] picked it up in the gym yeah now I'm
[1099.88 - 1103.52] doing it I'm I'm talking to my
[1101.72 - 1105.56] alternative medicine people I'm online
[1103.52 - 1107.00] figuring some stuff out maybe I can make
[1105.56 - 1108.92] a business out of this so you got
[1107.00 - 1111.32] millions of these people now in the
[1108.92 - 1113.56] world doing this very thing it's two
[1111.32 - 1115.12] sides of the aisle you got the
[1113.56 - 1116.96] plant-based people and the vegan people
[1115.12 - 1119.60] and then you got the animal based people
[1116.96 - 1121.24] and the carnivore people they're all
[1119.60 - 1122.92] thinking they're Geniuses they're all
[1121.24 - 1124.64] thinking they got it down and they all
[1122.92 - 1126.80] think they're actually the experts and
[1124.64 - 1130.12] gurus now because they fixed their
[1126.80 - 1132.44] little problem that they had easily by
[1130.12 - 1136.76] just cutting out the processed
[1132.44 - 1140.08] food drinking a little bit more

[1395.20 - 1398.60] chronic illness and they're in the way
[1397.20 - 1402.04] of the food
[1398.60 - 1404.28] Wars they're in the way because it's a
[1402.04 - 1406.36] different situation nobody's identifying
[1404.28 - 1409.40] it or acknowledging it or understanding
[1406.36 - 1413.04] it and the chronically sick
[1409.40 - 1417.72] person is dealing with so much more and
[1413.04 - 1418.68] you got a whole bunch of ego ego Maniacs
[1417.72 - 1422.24] in the
[1418.68 - 1424.36] industry that are in the food War
[1422.24 - 1427.08] screaming my science is better than
[1424.36 - 1429.52] yours my science is better than yours
[1427.08 - 1432.28] mine is and the wars between the
[1429.52 - 1435.24] plant-based movement trying to prove
[1432.28 - 1437.12] themselves all the time to the animal
[1435.24 - 1438.96] based movement and the animal based
[1437.12 - 1440.60] movement's trying to prove themselves
[1438.96 - 1443.32] all the time to the plant-based movement
[1440.60 - 1445.20] and that war is ensuing with a bunch of
[1443.32 - 1447.40] people that never really got that sick
[1445.20 - 1448.64] yet that thinks think they know
[1447.40 - 1449.88] everything and they're the ultimate
[1448.64 - 1452.28] gurus and then everybody who's

[1494.08 - 1499.52] pains or the fatigue or the brain fog
[1496.20 - 1503.44] and I could list a 100 other symptoms
[1499.52 - 1505.80] but they got the nerve the neurological
[1503.44 - 1507.80] problems and they got the metals that
[1505.80 - 1509.24] are deep in the organs and they're
[1507.80 - 1512.24] suffering and
[1509.24 - 1514.92] struggling and they're just in the way
[1512.24 - 1514.92] of the food
[1515.84 - 1522.00] Wars a Noto sick person may believe it's
[1519.24 - 1525.60] saage sacrilege
[1522.00 - 1528.84] if you're complaining still after trying
[1525.60 - 1531.44] to do alternative medicine
[1528.84 - 1533.52] and that alternative medicine doesn't
[1531.44 - 1535.48] have its limits that's what they say
[1533.52 - 1536.96] that's what the people who are not so
[1535.48 - 1538.64] sick it's like alternative medicine
[1536.96 - 1541.24] doesn't have its limits I went to a
[1538.64 - 1543.12] great alternative doctor I'm fine I got
[1541.24 - 1545.56] off of all the junk food I did my
[1543.12 - 1547.72] research I'm a researcher I'm a
[1545.56 - 1549.40] researcher how many times you hear that
[1547.72 - 1552.08] now you see that in people's profiles
[1549.40 - 1552.08] it's like
[1554.24 - 1558.24] researcher the not so sick person is
[1556.72 - 1559.84] also unaware
[1558.24 - 1561.40] that as much as a practitioner has
[1559.84 - 1562.64] expertise in alternative medicine it
[1561.40 - 1564.88] doesn't mean that they have all the
[1562.64 - 1567.92] tools and knowledge that means
[1564.88 - 1569.72] that just because you're an alternative
[1567.92 - 1572.32] practitioner it doesn't mean you have
[1569.72 - 1573.44] all the tools in the knowledge if you're
[1572.32 - 1576.24] really
[1573.44 - 1578.28] sick and you're not well and you've been
[1576.24 - 1580.24] there you know that just because you're
[1578.28 - 1581.92] an alternative practitioner it doesn't
[1580.24 - 1585.28] mean you have all the
[1581.92 - 1585.28] answers it just
[1586.60 - 1591.60] doesn't
[1589.20 - 1594.48] some not so sick individuals can get
[1591.60 - 1596.56] very staunch about their remedies even
[1594.48 - 1599.40] vindictive so what here's what it means
[1596.56 - 1603.84] so in the food Wars some animal-based
[1599.40 - 1607.44] people can be staunch on their
[1603.84 - 1610.36] stuff on their remedies just staunch and
[1607.44 - 1612.08] then the plant-based vegan movement some
[1610.36 - 1614.32] of those not so sick people there in the
[1612.08 - 1617.32] food Wars man they could be staunch
[1614.32 - 1618.88] about their remedies even vindictive
[1617.32 - 1620.56] they you can be quick to ridicule
[1618.88 - 1623.32] anything that doesn't seem part of the
[1620.56 - 1626.32] norm of alternative
[1623.32 - 1629.64] medicine anything that's not part of the
[1626.32 - 1631.72] norm Right medical medium is not part of
[1629.64 - 1634.24] the
[1631.72 - 1635.92] norm people who come to Medical medium
[1634.24 - 1637.64] information have tried everything
[1635.92 - 1639.92] they're not just going to go and come to
[1637.64 - 1642.76] Medical medium
[1639.92 - 1644.00] information just for any old reason oh
[1642.76 - 1646.24] I'll just come to Medical medium
[1644.00 - 1648.92] information I won't try the millions of
[1646.24 - 1650.72] other alternative crap that's out there
[1648.92 - 1652.36] they come to medical medum information
[1650.72 - 1653.80] because they've tried it all they've
[1652.36 - 1656.80] done it all they've been through hell
[1653.80 - 1659.68] and back that's why they come
[1656.80 - 1663.32] here this leads to Alternative Medicine
[1659.68 - 1665.84] sometimes acting as a cult all doing the
[1663.32 - 1667.12] same thing all saying the same thing so
[1665.84 - 1669.52] what you'll notice in alternative
[1667.12 - 1672.16] medicine and the plant-based movement
[1669.52 - 1675.80] and the vegan movement is they all parir
[1672.16 - 1678.88] it the same thing as if it's one big
[1675.80 - 1681.96] ugly cult
[1678.88 - 1684.92] same thing with the animal uh protein
[1681.96 - 1689.44] animal-based people all
[1684.92 - 1692.28] parting the same thing protein protein
[1689.44 - 1693.60] amino acids amino acids it's like a
[1692.28 - 1696.00] goddamn
[1693.60 - 1698.76] cult that's what it
[1696.00 - 1701.60] is because it's really just nothing but
[1698.76 - 1704.36] like no protein protein that's what you
[1701.60 - 1707.72] have to do families break up because of
[1704.36 - 1710.40] the whole protein talk families family
[1707.72 - 1713.64] members break up because of the whole
[1710.40 - 1715.28] protein talk there's like Calamity that
[1713.64 - 1717.32] happens out there that's
[1715.28 - 1721.60] unbelievable about where you get your
[1717.32 - 1724.40] protein it's one of those like epic epic
[1721.60 - 1725.84] topics that just doesn't stop it just
[1724.40 - 1728.60] doesn't
[1725.84 - 1730.60] stop and so many people are up against
[1728.60 - 1732.24] it and so they're up against peer
[1730.60 - 1734.88] pressure which is
[1732.24 - 1738.24] cultish insanely
[1734.88 - 1741.52] cultish because what happens here is
[1738.24 - 1744.88] that the people in the food Wars the
[1741.52 - 1747.32] staunch animal protein and staunch
[1744.88 - 1750.56] plantbase they stand with such
[1747.32 - 1752.96] conviction that the other side is wrong
[1750.56 - 1755.88] they'll do everything they can to prove
[1752.96 - 1758.96] that point in somehow some
[1755.88 - 1761.80] way and so they'll just go and attack so
[1758.96 - 1761.80] the attacking
[1762.68 - 1767.44] happens this leads Salter medicine
[1765.36 - 1769.36] sometimes acting as a cult all doing the
[1767.44 - 1772.00] same thing all saying the same thing all
[1769.36 - 1774.12] belief systems tied together even if
[1772.00 - 1776.24] there are subgroups where one Camp
[1774.12 - 1778.60] believes in plant-based diet and another
[1776.24 - 1780.24] Camp believes in animal proteins they're
[1778.60 - 1781.64] still tied together with the same
[1780.24 - 1784.48] cultish
[1781.64 - 1788.04] Concepts this mentality can lead some of
[1784.48 - 1790.36] the not so sick to quickly interrogate
[1788.04 - 1793.20] and ridicule and even bully someone
[1790.36 - 1796.36] who's sick and seasoned someone who's
[1793.20 - 1797.68] been doing something else so what
[1796.36 - 1800.16] happens is that there's a lot of
[1797.68 - 1803.24] bullying going on out there and
[1800.16 - 1806.40] social for whatever your belief system
[1803.24 - 1807.28] is the bullying is insane like the
[1806.40 - 1808.88] medical
[1807.28 - 1811.32] medium
[1808.88 - 1814.04] Community was about protecting people
[1811.32 - 1817.76] from the bullying because it was so
[1814.04 - 1819.64] harsh so harsh out there I mean people
[1817.76 - 1821.08] scream at you if you're eating one way
[1819.64 - 1824.96] they scream at you if you're eating
[1821.08 - 1828.40] another way and that's what it's like in
[1824.96 - 1830.64] Social out there medical me Community is
[1828.40 - 1834.88] a supportive place for the chronically
[1830.64 - 1838.48] ill people who are really chronically
[1834.88 - 1840.72] sick this mentality can lead some of the
[1838.48 - 1842.64] not so sick people who aren't that sick
[1840.72 - 1843.88] people who didn't get really sick yet to
[1842.64 - 1847.04] quickly
[1843.88 - 1849.08] interrogate and Bully the person who's
[1847.04 - 1852.12] really
[1849.08 - 1855.36] sick at the same time some of the not so
[1852.12 - 1856.88] sick exalt alternative medicine and
[1855.36 - 1858.52] you'll see that out there the not so
[1856.88 - 1860.16] sick out there they've never been sick
[1858.52 - 1862.00] enough but they're building their brands
[1860.16 - 1863.96] they're building up they'll exalt
[1862.00 - 1866.80] alternative
[1863.96 - 1870.00] medicine they'll say cold plunging is
[1866.80 - 1873.32] the answer like cold plunging is the
[1870.00 - 1875.80] answer and they'll just exalt it on a
[1873.32 - 1878.16] pedestal they'll put it up there as an
[1875.80 - 1881.36] idol to pray
[1878.16 - 1883.56] to and if cold plunging didn't fix you
[1881.36 - 1886.20] then you're just screwed
[1883.56 - 1888.24] up if cold plunging didn't fix you
[1886.20 - 1890.80] you're just yeah you're just screwed up
[1888.24 - 1890.80] that's what you
[1894.16 - 1898.84] are at the same time some of the not so
[1896.72 - 1901.08] sick people exalt alternative medicine
[1898.84 - 1903.48] they tend to believe that if the world
[1901.08 - 1905.24] of alternative medicine did fail them
[1903.48 - 1907.44] certainly conventional medicine would
[1905.24 - 1909.92] redeem itself and be there to catch
[1907.44 - 1911.44] their fall they believe this even after
[1909.92 - 1913.48] having a spell with conventional
[1911.44 - 1914.76] medicine that wasn't fixing them that's
[1913.48 - 1917.16] another thing that happens in the food
[1914.76 - 1919.80] Wars the not so sick people both PL
[1917.16 - 1922.08] plant-based and vegan believe that if
[1919.80 - 1925.28] they fail somehow if alternative
[1922.08 - 1928.72] medicine failed them somehow then
[1925.28 - 1931.20] conventional medicine will save them
[1928.72 - 1933.96] they really believe that and then the
[1931.20 - 1937.56] animal protein based people who are not
[1933.96 - 1939.80] so sick right they believe that if they
[1937.56 - 1942.16] ever failed and alternative medicine
[1939.80 - 1945.40] failed them they believe conventional
[1942.16 - 1948.08] medicine will then come in and fix it
[1945.40 - 1950.72] and make all their troubles go
[1948.08 - 1952.52] way both the not so sick and the sick
[1950.72 - 1955.24] are looking for answers though at the
[1952.52 - 1957.72] same time The Not So Sick can partake in
[1955.24 - 1959.56] past present and future Trends they
[1957.72 - 1961.52] usually won't realize the needles not
[1959.56 - 1963.52] being moved and they're not making real
[1961.52 - 1965.52] progress so if you're not that sick you
[1963.52 - 1969.84] can still partake in everything cold
[1965.52 - 1973.28] plunging breathing exercises any
[1969.84 - 1976.16] meditation um and the list goes on right
[1973.28 - 1978.12] this water that stuff you know water
[1976.16 - 1981.64] fasting
[1978.12 - 1983.40] juice fasting longterm whatever it is so
[1981.64 - 1985.16] they believe that they can partake in
[1983.40 - 1986.72] all of that but they don't know what's
[1985.16 - 1988.88] moving the needle or not cuz they were
[1986.72 - 1992.04] never that sick it's like taking
[1988.88 - 1994.24] somebody who never got ill yet they only
[1992.04 - 1996.24] had a couple little things that they got
[1994.24 - 1997.96] better just by cleaning up their diet a
[1996.24 - 2000.04] little bit and you just you could put
[1997.96 - 2002.04] them through anything really for a while
[2000.04 - 2003.44] you can have them try anything and they
[2002.04 - 2006.40] really don't know what moves the needle
[2003.44 - 2008.96] they just think it's working because hey
[2006.40 - 2008.96] they're not
[2009.28 - 2014.44] sick their good health or their health
[2012.16 - 2016.16] that's good enough is overriding any
[2014.44 - 2018.52] effects of anything negative that
[2016.16 - 2020.96] they're doing all right so I want to cut
[2018.52 - 2024.56] into a couple of other things too you
[2020.96 - 2027.48] guys with this so if you guys just got
[2024.56 - 2029.84] on got on right here listen to to my
[2027.48 - 2031.88] episode food Wars It's medical beam
[2029.84 - 2034.84] podcast at Apple podcast check it out
[2031.88 - 2036.76] just released today okay check out the
[2034.84 - 2040.48] alcohol episode that was before it check
[2036.76 - 2043.12] out micro doing that was before that too
[2040.48 - 2045.36] as well so if you
[2043.12 - 2048.96] can all
[2045.36 - 2050.76] right both sides of the aisle animal
[2048.96 - 2053.32] based and
[2050.76 - 2054.52] plant-based believe that protein is the
[2053.32 - 2056.32] answer for
[2054.52 - 2060.04] everything they
[2056.32 - 2063.36] do they're married to the protein
[2060.04 - 2064.25] concept the protein Theory the protein
[2063.36 - 2065.32] belief
[2064.25 - 2067.52] [Music]
[2065.32 - 2069.76] system their
[2067.52 - 2072.16] married for
[2069.76 - 2074.52] life it's there in their psyche and
[2072.16 - 2078.44] their Consciousness and you can't remove
[2074.52 - 2080.84] it they learn it at a young age and they
[2078.44 - 2083.64] take it from there when they go into the
[2080.84 - 2085.80] alternative medicine world it's still
[2083.64 - 2088.72] there it started in conventional
[2085.80 - 2091.00] medicine it is in the alternative
[2088.72 - 2093.44] medicine they think the reason they're
[2091.00 - 2095.24] alive is protein so people believe
[2093.44 - 2097.40] they're alive because of the protein
[2095.24 - 2098.56] they're eating if they're plant-based
[2097.40 - 2100.32] they believe they're alive because of
[2098.56 - 2102.00] the plant-based protein they're eating
[2100.32 - 2103.56] if they're animal based they think
[2102.00 - 2106.76] they're alive because of the protein
[2103.56 - 2110.00] they're eating is an animal based person
[2106.76 - 2112.64] okay this partly comes from most people
[2110.00 - 2115.44] being raised on animal protein vegans
[2112.64 - 2117.48] and plant-based people won't adopt this
[2115.44 - 2120.32] way of eating unless someone convinces
[2117.48 - 2122.32] them in a confident manner that there's
[2120.32 - 2124.00] protein in plant in a plant-based diet
[2122.32 - 2126.56] so that's another thing
[2124.00 - 2128.20] too what you'll notice is people moving
[2126.56 - 2130.28] into plant
[2128.20 - 2133.20] base the only way they're going to move
[2130.28 - 2136.00] into plant-base is if they're confident
[2133.20 - 2141.88] there's enough protein there because all
[2136.00 - 2145.12] it takes is one boo one boo that's it
[2141.88 - 2147.16] not enough protein and the person runs
[2145.12 - 2148.64] screaming it's like you got somebody
[2147.16 - 2150.72] that's starting off of the plant-based
[2148.64 - 2152.36] movement a little bit doing plant-base
[2150.72 - 2155.04] they're trying it they're feeling a
[2152.36 - 2156.36] little better they're they're excited
[2155.04 - 2158.28] about what they're eating they're proud
[2156.36 - 2160.32] of what they're eating and then someone
[2158.28 - 2163.52] all they have to do is just whisper in
[2160.32 - 2167.00] their ear it's got no protein and they
[2163.52 - 2171.92] will scream and go
[2167.00 - 2176.32] running because that is a weapon it's
[2171.92 - 2176.32] weaponized and that's happening right
[2177.36 - 2182.08] now both animal-based and plant-based
[2180.20 - 2185.08] folks are brainwashed to think it's all
[2182.08 - 2188.04] about protein because protein sounds
[2185.08 - 2191.84] scientific got to keep in mind that
[2188.04 - 2192.72] anybody doing a diet of any kind for
[2191.84 - 2195.32] their
[2192.72 - 2197.48] health they they have to feel their
[2195.32 - 2200.00] science behind it in some
[2197.48 - 2202.12] way because science becomes like that
[2200.00 - 2204.28] comfortable blanket they got a nice
[2202.12 - 2206.04] comfy blanket it's a science blanket and
[2204.28 - 2208.68] everything's going to be fine cuz
[2206.04 - 2211.92] science has all the checks you know
[2208.68 - 2213.68] marked off and it's all good and they
[2211.92 - 2216.00] feel confident because they're in
[2213.68 - 2219.12] they're basking in that warmth and that
[2216.00 - 2221.72] comfort of science saving them so if
[2219.12 - 2224.12] science says protein and proteins in my
[2221.72 - 2226.52] food I'm good they have to feel that
[2224.12 - 2231.76] their diet belief system no matter what
[2226.52 - 2234.08] kind of name it gets to fancy it up is
[2231.76 - 2235.64] science-based people believe if they're
[2234.08 - 2237.48] going to be eating something different
[2235.64 - 2239.64] or start eating things that are
[2237.48 - 2241.80] different and start traveling into that
[2239.64 - 2245.64] place of alternative medicine both
[2241.80 - 2247.12] animal or or plant they need to think
[2245.64 - 2249.56] that there's definitely
[2247.12 - 2251.52] science-based within it all both sides
[2249.56 - 2254.24] are also brainwashed for
[2251.52 - 2256.40] confrontation before people who've gone
[2254.24 - 2258.20] plant-based eventually revert to animal
[2256.40 - 2260.32] products first they fight back
[2258.20 - 2263.84] plant-based folks don't look at animal
[2260.32 - 2267.16] based folks and say look we're all
[2263.84 - 2268.88] sick inside each side seeks out their
[2267.16 - 2270.52] weapons of choice in the form of studies
[2268.88 - 2272.72] and research papers because that's
[2270.52 - 2275.20] another thing too they
[2272.72 - 2276.84] weaponize they weaponize science and
[2275.20 - 2278.96] science studies and what you'll not Noti
[2276.84 - 2281.04] in the science study Department which is
[2278.96 - 2285.32] hilarious is that when someone throws
[2281.04 - 2287.20] out a science study or science article
[2285.32 - 2289.72] what's in the article isn't even what
[2287.20 - 2291.56] they're talking about what's in the
[2289.72 - 2293.44] study isn't even what they're talking
[2291.56 - 2294.44] about people aren't going to take the
[2293.44 - 2296.92] time they're not going to take the time
[2294.44 - 2298.20] to read the study they may not even
[2296.92 - 2301.40] understand the study if they ever did
[2298.20 - 2304.16] read it so that's a weaponized situation
[2301.40 - 2306.24] all on its own so when you see somebody
[2304.16 - 2308.68] and they're like look this plant-based
[2306.24 - 2310.40] diet and this here does this here's a
[2308.68 - 2312.48] scientific study for it no one's going
[2310.40 - 2314.08] to read it and if they did read it
[2312.48 - 2315.64] they'd be like I'm missing something
[2314.08 - 2317.56] here because that's not what the person
[2315.64 - 2320.48] was even talking about but yet it's
[2317.56 - 2323.32] weaponized and used to that
[2320.48 - 2325.40] degree both the committed and committed
[2323.32 - 2327.60] animal protein people and the committed
[2325.40 - 2329.68] plant-based and vegan people call
[2327.60 - 2331.48] themselves researchers now I covered
[2329.68 - 2333.40] that earlier they spend a lot of time on
[2331.48 - 2335.84] the internet looking around for
[2333.40 - 2337.32] information so they're researching but
[2335.84 - 2339.40] what are they researching searching
[2337.32 - 2341.00] that's another thing all on its own star
[2339.40 - 2343.24] catcher says over there on YouTube as a
[2341.00 - 2346.76] vegan I don't feel desperate for science
[2343.24 - 2348.40] we have tons of science behind it well
[2346.76 - 2350.48] that's the whole thing that tons of
[2348.40 - 2352.84] science behind it is that warm comfy
[2350.48 - 2355.12] blanket I was just talking about and
[2352.84 - 2357.12] that has to be there for you to actually
[2355.12 - 2358.60] probably want to be vegan because you're
[2357.12 - 2360.00] saying you have a ton of science behind
[2358.60 - 2362.44] it now I'm not against vegan I'm not
[2360.00 - 2365.88] against the animal protein that's not
[2362.44 - 2368.96] what this is but what you just said
[2365.88 - 2371.88] proved my my point that there's a ton of
[2368.96 - 2375.16] science behind plant-based so you're not
[2371.88 - 2377.56] desperate for science what that means is
[2375.16 - 2380.60] this exactly what I said that's your
[2377.56 - 2383.36] comfy warm blanket that there's science
[2380.60 - 2386.28] behind it and everything's
[2383.36 - 2389.40] fine they throw articles at each
[2386.28 - 2391.04] other that are science-based so the
[2389.40 - 2392.80] plant-based movement is throwing
[2391.04 - 2395.40] articles at the animal based the animal
[2392.80 - 2398.32] based is throwing articles at the
[2395.40 - 2401.08] plant-based that's huge it's happening
[2398.32 - 2404.00] every day right now they say well this
[2401.08 - 2406.48] keto study says this when it isn't even
[2404.00 - 2409.24] a real study it's a survey or an
[2406.48 - 2410.68] uninformed observation or a theoretical
[2409.24 - 2412.80] paper put together by health
[2410.68 - 2415.64] professionals with limited experience on
[2412.80 - 2418.04] the subject and if they do reference an
[2415.64 - 2420.16] actual clinical study how reputable was
[2418.04 - 2422.04] it who funded it was it based on a
[2420.16 - 2424.48] handful of paid participants from the
[2422.04 - 2427.72] same age and background monitored over a
[2424.48 - 2429.16] very short time or was was it something
[2427.72 - 2431.68] better than
[2429.16 - 2433.40] that meanwhile they're all still getting
[2431.68 - 2437.64] sick so let's go into this a little bit
[2433.40 - 2440.40] plant-based and animal based people they
[2437.64 - 2443.64] fall they might be not so sick to start
[2440.40 - 2444.72] with maybe they're healthy enough but
[2443.64 - 2446.64] they
[2444.72 - 2451.24] drop they
[2446.64 - 2454.84] fall over time it happens every day it's
[2451.24 - 2458.36] out there and when they start falling
[2454.84 - 2461.88] they doubt everything they've ever
[2458.36 - 2464.72] done they doubt everything they ever did
[2461.88 - 2467.56] what they used what they may may have
[2464.72 - 2470.68] should have they thought used whatever
[2467.56 - 2474.64] strategy they had whatever belief system
[2470.68 - 2478.08] all of it turns into a mud
[2474.64 - 2480.40] puddle the minute something happens to
[2478.08 - 2482.92] you like you get the exposure or a virus
[2480.40 - 2485.52] comes out of dormy and now you're sick
[2482.92 - 2487.40] and you're really Doctor shopping
[2485.52 - 2489.68] everything
[2487.40 - 2491.24] is either on the table or everything is
[2489.68 - 2495.08] either off the
[2491.24 - 2497.76] table that's when it's like whoa and it
[2495.08 - 2502.32] happens every single day I
[2497.76 - 2505.60] know because at Medical medium we get
[2502.32 - 2508.84] thousands and thousands of
[2505.60 - 2510.88] DMS and in those DMS are I was never
[2508.84 - 2513.84] sick before in my life I ate good I was
[2510.88 - 2516.32] really healthy I'm a trainer of 10 years
[2513.84 - 2517.96] I'm desperate in needing your help
[2516.32 - 2520.16] because I can't function and I have a
[2517.96 - 2522.32] brain fog that's making it so I'm taking
[2520.16 - 2523.96] benzo as aines and I don't know what to
[2522.32 - 2527.52] do
[2523.96 - 2530.84] anymore I thought I had it down every
[2527.52 - 2532.48] single day you know I had this one
[2530.84 - 2534.68] symptom and it was doing great when I
[2532.48 - 2536.44] started intermittent fasting and then I
[2534.68 - 2539.76] you everything was great for about 3
[2536.44 - 2541.84] months four months I was doing good and
[2539.76 - 2543.56] all of a sudden now I can't feel my legs
[2541.84 - 2545.56] anymore I've been to five doctors I
[2543.56 - 2548.20] don't know what's wrong with me and if
[2545.56 - 2552.52] they fall and then it all turns to
[2548.20 - 2555.24] Mud every single week every single year
[2552.52 - 2558.12] we see it thousands upon thousands of
[2555.24 - 2559.68] people that had good health seemingly
[2558.12 - 2561.68] everything was good they were
[2559.68 - 2566.00] researchers they were connoisseurs of
[2561.68 - 2567.84] alternative medicine they they many were
[2566.00 - 2569.64] like I don't like Pharmaceuticals and
[2567.84 - 2572.28] many were like I don't like this and
[2569.64 - 2573.84] they all had this belief system and they
[2572.28 - 2575.60] were on either side of the aisle they
[2573.84 - 2579.04] were plant-based and vegan or they were
[2575.60 - 2581.64] animal prot R and they
[2579.04 - 2584.56] fell and many of them are like I'm an
[2581.64 - 2586.96] Olympic Athlete aw and I can't even get
[2584.56 - 2588.88] out of bed right now and I've been keto
[2586.96 - 2591.44] all these years I've tried carnivore I
[2588.88 - 2594.40] did good on Carnivore for a while and
[2591.44 - 2597.04] I'm Olympic Athlete I'm a gold medalist
[2594.40 - 2598.16] I need your help and I'm desperate and I
[2597.04 - 2600.68] don't know what to do anymore and I've
[2598.16 - 2603.12] been to my like 20th doctor every single
[2600.68 - 2606.16] day it's like
[2603.12 - 2609.48] this and that's how it works but the
[2606.16 - 2611.48] chronically sick who are trying to heal
[2609.48 - 2613.04] don't know they're not aware of all this
[2611.48 - 2615.44] that's happening they're not aware of
[2613.04 - 2619.08] the games in the industry whole bunch of
[2615.44 - 2622.28] not so sick people building their brands
[2619.08 - 2624.16] screaming science back at each other
[2622.28 - 2626.48] confusing
[2624.16 - 2628.76] everybody two sides of the aisle you're
[2626.48 - 2630.20] either on one aisle or the other and
[2628.76 - 2632.24] anybody who's chronically sick and
[2630.20 - 2633.88] between you're just kind of like caught
[2632.24 - 2638.08] in the mucket of all even if you don't
[2633.88 - 2638.08] realize it it happens
[2638.44 - 2642.24] I want to talk about how both sides of
[2639.96 - 2644.28] the aisle are brainwashed I want to just
[2642.24 - 2646.64] cover that one little spot right
[2644.28 - 2648.44] here and the thing the thing you know
[2646.64 - 2651.08] what happens is things change when
[2648.44 - 2652.96] people find medical medium
[2651.08 - 2655.04] information you know but I'm just
[2652.96 - 2658.76] telling you this is what's happening out
[2655.04 - 2660.48] there okay both sides are brainwashed
[2658.76 - 2662.88] this is really
[2660.48 - 2664.76] interesting the bottom line is that both
[2662.88 - 2667.24] sides are brainwashed they're
[2664.76 - 2670.56] brainwashed that they can trust the
[2667.24 - 2670.56] science behind their
[2671.00 - 2676.28] diet the brainwashed that they can trust
[2674.36 - 2678.88] the science behind their
[2676.28 - 2681.12] diet that one's one of my
[2678.88 - 2683.80] favorites they're brainwashed that
[2681.12 - 2685.88] protein is
[2683.80 - 2688.20] everything vegans and a plant-based
[2685.88 - 2690.48] people and the animal-based people are
[2688.20 - 2692.40] brainwashed that protein is everything
[2690.48 - 2695.56] even if you don't think it or believe it
[2692.40 - 2696.68] they do they're brainwashed to comfort
[2695.56 - 2700.72] each other
[2696.68 - 2700.72] other here's another one too
[2703.16 - 2708.28] right okay ready both sides of the food
[2706.12 - 2712.36] Wars are brainwashed that intermittent
[2708.28 - 2714.20] fasting is healthy all right so I want
[2712.36 - 2717.20] to go into this a little bit here this
[2714.20 - 2720.44] is powerful information part of this is
[2717.20 - 2722.36] in the podcast so check it out if you
[2720.44 - 2723.84] can medical Me podcast at Apple podcast
[2722.36 - 2726.80] food
[2723.84 - 2728.96] Wars all right so their brain washed to
[2726.80 - 2731.00] confront each other their both sides are
[2728.96 - 2732.76] Brainwashed the intermittent fasting is
[2731.00 - 2734.20] healthy and you might hear that right
[2732.76 - 2737.60] now and say intermittent fasting is
[2734.20 - 2740.80] healthy because it is healthy it
[2737.60 - 2742.92] is but it's not healthy medical me
[2740.80 - 2746.92] information talks about why in the whole
[2742.92 - 2748.44] bit why it's critical not to go too long
[2746.92 - 2750.64] without
[2748.44 - 2752.84] food because of what happens to the
[2750.64 - 2756.28] adrenals and what happens to other
[2752.84 - 2758.16] situations with your body so both sides
[2756.28 - 2760.12] believe intermittent fasting is healthy
[2758.16 - 2761.20] both sides are brainwashed that caffeine
[2760.12 - 2765.08] is
[2761.20 - 2766.80] good yeah that's right plant-based
[2765.08 - 2770.08] doctors all have their caffeine every
[2766.80 - 2772.64] single morning the plant-based podcast
[2770.08 - 2774.84] doctors have their caffeine plant-based
[2772.64 - 2777.64] people think cacao caffeine is really
[2774.84 - 2780.32] good for you but the animal based people
[2777.64 - 2782.36] believe Cacao is good for you carnivore
[2780.32 - 2784.80] people even believe that now everybody
[2782.36 - 2786.44] believes that cacao's good for
[2784.80 - 2790.36] you
[2786.44 - 2792.40] both sides are Brainwashed the quality
[2790.36 - 2795.72] salt to
[2792.40 - 2798.64] food is good and that Apple CID of
[2795.72 - 2801.32] vinegar is good but there's such thing
[2798.64 - 2802.80] as too much salt and both sides don't
[2801.32 - 2805.20] believe that
[2802.80 - 2806.72] now both sides are brainwashed that you
[2805.20 - 2808.76] can fix all your problems through
[2806.72 - 2811.52] breathing techniques or through
[2808.76 - 2813.84] manifesting so right now and I'm not
[2811.52 - 2816.04] saying other or different I'm just
[2813.84 - 2819.20] saying that both sides plant B based
[2816.04 - 2820.96] movement and the animal based movement
[2819.20 - 2824.20] believe
[2820.96 - 2826.84] okay that they can solve their problems
[2824.20 - 2829.12] through breathing techniques and through
[2826.84 - 2830.08] manifesting not saying manifesting is
[2829.12 - 2832.28] bad or
[2830.08 - 2834.84] good I'm just saying that's what they
[2832.28 - 2837.44] believe both sides are brainwashed that
[2834.84 - 2839.76] chocolate is plant
[2837.44 - 2841.84] medicine and it's good for you so that's
[2839.76 - 2844.36] one thing that's really interesting too
[2841.84 - 2846.44] because it's just like the whole caca
[2844.36 - 2849.04] thing but they even believe
[2846.44 - 2852.12] chocolate which yeah it's cacao but it
[2849.04 - 2854.48] moved into chocolate bars that's even
[2852.12 - 2856.80] good it's not just like cacao and you
[2854.48 - 2859.28] got like a high quality cacao which
[2856.80 - 2860.68] still has caffeine in it still a problem
[2859.28 - 2862.68] I know that people eat it fine they
[2860.68 - 2866.08] could do what they want but even
[2862.68 - 2868.52] chocolate bars like 90% 80% 70%
[2866.08 - 2870.12] chocolate with sugar in it the whole bit
[2868.52 - 2872.40] you know it's good for you it's plant
[2870.12 - 2873.76] medicine people eat chocolate bars every
[2872.40 - 2875.76] single day they think they buy the
[2873.76 - 2878.48] organic healthy chocolate bars
[2875.76 - 2879.76] sustainable and they're like all good so
[2878.48 - 2882.32] that's one right
[2879.76 - 2884.68] there both sides of the aisle are
[2882.32 - 2888.36] brainwashed that you that they don't
[2884.68 - 2890.52] create any waste with their food
[2888.36 - 2892.16] decisions so whatever food decision
[2890.52 - 2894.12] you're making and how you do your diet
[2892.16 - 2895.96] and what you do you believe that you
[2894.12 - 2898.24] probably don't create that much waste if
[2895.96 - 2901.32] you're on one of these sides of the
[2898.24 - 2902.48] aisle and both believe that if you ever
[2901.32 - 2904.84] challenged
[2902.48 - 2906.60] anybody if you ever talked with them or
[2904.84 - 2909.60] interviewed them you think they'd be
[2906.60 - 2912.04] like oh yeah I create tons of food
[2909.60 - 2914.72] waste it's like if you talk to some
[2912.04 - 2917.08] animal protein Guru and you tell them
[2914.72 - 2918.72] like are you sustainable are you not you
[2917.08 - 2922.24] know are you creating too much food
[2918.72 - 2923.76] waste they say no way not creating any
[2922.24 - 2925.44] food waste and the same thing with
[2923.76 - 2927.84] plant-based people like are you creating
[2925.44 - 2930.72] any food waste they'd be like no way
[2927.84 - 2933.96] we're not contributing to food waste
[2930.72 - 2937.60] both sides believe that they're both
[2933.96 - 2937.60] brainwashed to believe that
[2939.20 - 2943.00] Alicia over there on IG Anthony why do
[2941.32 - 2945.00] you think
[2943.00 - 2948.12] people bash
[2945.00 - 2950.60] mm info after healing with
[2948.12 - 2952.56] it so here's how it works with the
[2950.60 - 2953.76] bashing medical meme information after
[2952.56 - 2957.48] healing with
[2953.76 - 2960.84] it it's about brands starting your own
[2957.48 - 2962.76] brand okay so what they do is they have
[2960.84 - 2965.68] to bash mm
[2962.76 - 2967.80] information or people won't go and buy
[2965.68 - 2972.08] their new product they're selling which
[2967.80 - 2974.44] is like a course a class or some kind of
[2972.08 - 2976.04] program so what I'm noticing is the
[2974.44 - 2979.20] people that bash medical medium after
[2976.04 - 2982.00] using it to heal they're all doing their
[2979.20 - 2985.96] business and businesses I'm just telling
[2982.00 - 2988.68] you how it is and how it works okay so
[2985.96 - 2990.08] if you don't bash medical medium people
[2988.68 - 2994.28] are going to be like why should I buy
[2990.08 - 2996.44] your $500 course or your $3,000 course
[2994.28 - 2998.00] when I can just get free information
[2996.44 - 2999.64] from medical medium's books you can get
[2998.00 - 3002.00] out the library or just listen to all
[2999.64 - 3003.68] his stuff and get free you know lectures
[3002.00 - 3006.48] every day from them or whatever it is
[3003.68 - 3008.96] and free information and his podcast and
[3006.48 - 3011.04] so forth and so what happens is they
[3008.96 - 3013.16] bash medical medum information because
[3011.04 - 3016.80] they want them to come to
[3013.16 - 3019.36] them I'm selling a $3,000 course medical
[3016.80 - 3022.04] medium can't do it for you it's it
[3019.36 - 3023.16] doesn't work oh yeah know I did heal
[3022.04 - 3025.72] from
[3023.16 - 3027.24] it and then they changed their tune too
[3025.72 - 3030.12] so anybody who's
[3027.24 - 3032.20] bashing anybody who's healed using
[3030.12 - 3034.52] medical medum information and then they
[3032.20 - 3036.48] start their business on social and their
[3034.52 - 3038.72] brand and then they bash medical medium
[3036.48 - 3040.52] information stop saying medical medium
[3038.72 - 3043.24] information heal them and they delete
[3040.52 - 3043.24] all their past
[3043.72 - 3050.92] posts so that's what they do too and
[3046.92 - 3052.60] they say by my products you know by my
[3050.92 - 3054.04] you know ionizer water machines and what
[3052.60 - 3056.00] you'll notice is a lot of the people
[3054.04 - 3058.72] that bash medical Med information their
[3056.00 - 3059.96] ionizer water machine sales people the
[3058.72 - 3062.12] pyramid
[3059.96 - 3063.72] scheme and they know that medical medium
[3062.12 - 3067.40] doesn't support the ionizer water
[3063.72 - 3071.64] machines so they purposely bash mm for
[3067.40 - 3073.68] that but it's about building your brand
[3071.64 - 3076.88] and then stepping on the very thing that
[3073.68 - 3078.88] healed you and then not telling anybody
[3076.88 - 3082.48] it healed you
[3078.88 - 3084.68] anymore and then leading them into your
[3082.48 - 3086.08] feed and then trying to sell them
[3084.68 - 3088.84] whatever program thing you're doing
[3086.08 - 3089.96] that's $3,000 $5,000 or $2,000 whatever
[3088.84 - 3092.84] it
[3089.96 - 3094.08] is I got I don't care if anybody's
[3092.84 - 3096.48] trying to make money and doing things
[3094.08 - 3098.28] and selling things whatever it is that's
[3096.48 - 3099.36] the world we live in that's what
[3098.28 - 3102.40] everybody
[3099.36 - 3104.84] does but yeah but that is what that's
[3102.40 - 3108.40] how they're doing it so that question
[3104.84 - 3110.64] you just asked I'm just answering it to
[3108.40 - 3113.20] you know how it's done and there's a lot
[3110.64 - 3115.76] more info along with that and I can talk
[3113.20 - 3117.56] about that for like quite a while but
[3115.76 - 3120.68] that's what they do it's about building
[3117.56 - 3123.84] your brand hiring like you know taking a
[3120.68 - 3126.72] course that teaches you how to take the
[3123.84 - 3129.96] information poach it and not cite it
[3126.72 - 3133.04] anymore and then re repackage it for
[3129.96 - 3135.00] your own program and then [ __ ] on the
[3133.04 - 3137.68] person who created that
[3135.00 - 3140.32] information and then sell it to some
[3137.68 - 3142.56] other people and then bash medical
[3140.32 - 3145.80] medium in what seems to be like a kind
[3142.56 - 3148.32] of like way where yeah well
[3145.80 - 3150.52] it doesn't really help that much and it
[3148.32 - 3152.52] didn't really help me that much and you
[3150.52 - 3154.60] know try my stuff and a whole bunch of
[3152.52 - 3157.16] stuff like that a lot of misinformation
[3154.60 - 3159.84] people have mixed in with medical
[3157.16 - 3161.84] medium info a lot of people don't
[3159.84 - 3163.40] actually learn the info and read the
[3161.84 - 3164.56] books themselves so there what's
[3163.40 - 3166.12] happening out there too is they're
[3164.56 - 3167.44] packaging up medical medium information
[3166.12 - 3169.64] they're mixing it with a whole bunch of
[3167.44 - 3171.80] other information and they're try to
[3169.64 - 3173.84] sell it or they'll just take mm info and
[3171.80 - 3175.24] pack [ __ ] up and and try to sell it so
[3173.84 - 3177.92] that's what's happening and that's why
[3175.24 - 3182.24] while you're seeing that people bashing
[3177.92 - 3184.96] medical medium info it's it's a way also
[3182.24 - 3187.64] it's a way to try to like get some
[3184.96 - 3190.00] haters on board haters are like they're
[3187.64 - 3191.72] screaming they just scream and scream so
[3190.00 - 3194.20] it's like you get a few haters on board
[3191.72 - 3196.24] the haters are now screaming and then
[3194.20 - 3198.56] you get a few extra people in and then
[3196.24 - 3202.12] you get lucky it's like and it's like
[3198.56 - 3204.44] the scratch off tickets at the you know
[3202.12 - 3207.08] at the at the liquor store and you get
[3204.44 - 3212.00] lucky and all of a sudden you just won a
[3207.08 - 3215.20] new person who buys your program for
[3212.00 - 3217.04] $1999 and it's like whoa this really
[3215.20 - 3219.36] works let me talk more crap about
[3217.04 - 3219.36] medical
[3219.64 - 3224.00] medium and then they throw a bunch of
[3221.84 - 3226.24] like psychological warfare in the mix
[3224.00 - 3229.08] where they're just like yeah medical
[3226.24 - 3231.28] medium didn't really work it kind of did
[3229.08 - 3233.44] but it did meanwhile PE they posted
[3231.28 - 3236.12] hundreds of posts about how it saved
[3233.44 - 3237.88] their life a like they showed how
[3236.12 - 3239.52] literally everything from the celery
[3237.88 - 3242.44] juice they Juiced every single morning
[3239.52 - 3244.40] for two years changed their life around
[3242.44 - 3248.24] they delete all of
[3244.40 - 3250.08] that I'm it's just crazy also there are
[3248.24 - 3252.44] people in the community pretending to be
[3250.08 - 3253.96] a part of the community when they're not
[3252.44 - 3256.40] and they're faking it so they can
[3253.96 - 3258.68] mislead people and push them off to some
[3256.40 - 3260.04] other place and ruin their health that
[3258.68 - 3261.44] happens every day in the medical meme
[3260.04 - 3262.96] Community it's a whole bunch of people
[3261.44 - 3264.44] with fake accounts that are actually
[3262.96 - 3266.64] trying to basically dismantle the
[3264.44 - 3268.96] medical meme community and they have
[3266.64 - 3271.48] like 20 fake
[3268.96 - 3273.32] accounts and we know this and they're
[3271.48 - 3276.76] out there and they're just in the
[3273.32 - 3281.84] community trying to actually persuade
[3276.76 - 3284.12] people to not do their hmds to not do
[3281.84 - 3286.72] the stuff they need to do for
[3284.12 - 3289.16] themselves yeah it's
[3286.72 - 3291.20] crazy both sides of the aisle
[3289.16 - 3294.00] unknowingly get too much blood drawn
[3291.20 - 3296.28] when they get a blood test by the way
[3294.00 - 3299.24] Uma over there on YouTube yeah we
[3296.28 - 3302.80] witnessed that yeah I
[3299.24 - 3304.72] bet it's out there every day both sides
[3302.80 - 3307.24] of the aisle believe their food choices
[3304.72 - 3311.56] now make them spiritually
[3307.24 - 3313.00] enlightened okay so here's how it goes
[3311.56 - 3314.04] with the spiritual enlightenment which
[3313.00 - 3316.08] is
[3314.04 - 3317.36] interesting I mean you see people out
[3316.08 - 3318.88] there you can have somebody that they go
[3317.36 - 3320.88] plant-based they go
[3318.88 - 3323.00] vegan they start doing all this
[3320.88 - 3324.48] meditating they start changing their
[3323.00 - 3327.20] lives they're doing their yoga they're
[3324.48 - 3329.44] doing everything everything and suddenly
[3327.20 - 3331.84] now they're spiritually
[3329.44 - 3333.96] enlightened right and you would hope
[3331.84 - 3336.24] they're spiritually enlightened they're
[3333.96 - 3338.32] plant-based they're doing yoga they're
[3336.24 - 3340.40] taking care of themselves you would hope
[3338.32 - 3342.44] that they're spiritually enlightened but
[3340.40 - 3344.04] then what if there's somebody and
[3342.44 - 3346.92] they're just an
[3344.04 - 3348.68] [ __ ] seriously because there's plenty
[3346.92 - 3350.44] of them out there I mean did you ever
[3348.68 - 3352.76] run into somebody that's just like they
[3350.44 - 3355.12] weren't really a nice person and they
[3352.76 - 3356.28] kind of like they betrayed you or they
[3355.12 - 3357.80] said something terrible they say
[3356.28 - 3359.64] terrible things to you there's people
[3357.80 - 3361.20] that get abused by people all the time
[3359.64 - 3363.88] out there right there's people that are
[3361.20 - 3368.52] gas lit by people all the time out there
[3363.88 - 3370.24] okay so are they spiritually enlightened
[3368.52 - 3373.20] CU I'm confused I scratched my head on
[3370.24 - 3374.60] that one so everybody in a yoga class
[3373.20 - 3376.84] every single person and I'm not anti-
[3374.60 - 3379.12] yoga I love when people do yoga the
[3376.84 - 3381.00] point is everybody's everybody that's in
[3379.12 - 3384.24] a yoga class say there's 50 people in a
[3381.00 - 3387.08] yoga class every all 50 of them are
[3384.24 - 3388.64] doing yoga they're doing their Machi te
[3387.08 - 3391.12] they're taking care of themselves
[3388.64 - 3393.24] they're they're watching what they eat
[3391.12 - 3396.92] they're like into all kinds of cool
[3393.24 - 3399.08] stuff all 50 are spiritually enlightened
[3396.92 - 3401.44] all 50 people in the yoga studio would
[3399.08 - 3404.08] never stab somebody in the back every
[3401.44 - 3406.60] last of one of those all 50 would would
[3404.08 - 3408.24] be unconditional to other people would
[3406.60 - 3409.68] never turn against them would never turn
[3408.24 - 3411.88] against a friend would never let
[3409.68 - 3414.12] somebody down would never be an [ __ ]
[3411.88 - 3416.08] to somebody so every single person in
[3414.12 - 3417.92] that yoga class all 50 are spiritually
[3416.08 - 3420.40] enlightened and would never hurt
[3417.92 - 3422.16] anybody I find that hard to believe
[3420.40 - 3423.40] there's bad people there's good people
[3422.16 - 3424.68] you see it out there and there's
[3423.40 - 3425.76] terrible things that happen every day
[3424.68 - 3428.92] out
[3425.76 - 3431.80] there and you can have a bad person with
[3428.92 - 3435.16] a cold heart doing terrible things
[3431.80 - 3438.20] eating just right a little bowl of
[3435.16 - 3441.08] berries a little dollop of yogur yogurt
[3438.20 - 3443.80] on there or whatever anything like that
[3441.08 - 3446.64] you can have a person that's just you
[3443.80 - 3448.72] know eating what somewhat clean and
[3446.64 - 3449.72] doing like what seems like all this
[3448.72 - 3452.08] great
[3449.72 - 3453.52] stuff and they're eating say plant-based
[3452.08 - 3455.72] or animal based and they're doing it
[3453.52 - 3456.92] really good and then they're also mean
[3455.72 - 3459.96] and they're mean-hearted and they're
[3456.92 - 3462.64] cold blooded and they just let people
[3459.96 - 3465.00] down and do terrible things that's just
[3462.64 - 3465.00] how it
[3466.60 - 3471.92] works both sides believe very much that
[3469.92 - 3475.72] they're different than the other
[3471.92 - 3478.64] side I talk to plant-based people
[3475.72 - 3481.24] right that are in the movement and they
[3478.64 - 3483.32] believe they are so different than the
[3481.24 - 3486.40] animal- based
[3483.32 - 3490.40] people so different and I talk to
[3486.40 - 3492.84] animal- based people right that are like
[3490.40 - 3495.12] out there in the health
[3492.84 - 3496.60] movement and they're doing stuff out
[3495.12 - 3498.68] there and they're known in the health
[3496.60 - 3501.44] movement I talk to them and they believe
[3498.68 - 3503.84] they're so different than the other
[3501.44 - 3507.56] side but it's laughable because they're
[3503.84 - 3507.56] not they're they're very much
[3508.28 - 3512.92] alike they are the same side the same
[3510.84 - 3515.04] belief systems and they shop at the same
[3512.92 - 3517.76] markets to get their
[3515.04 - 3520.56] food and the only difference is that one
[3517.76 - 3523.16] eats meat and the other
[3520.56 - 3526.44] doesn't ly says you saved my life thank
[3523.16 - 3528.40] you I'm honored I'm so happy you're here
[3526.44 - 3531.60] so you guys check out the medical
[3528.40 - 3534.92] podcast at Apple podcast if you

[3534.92 - 3540.56] true and you're the only one speaking on
[3537.20 - 3543.32] this I love how you're inclusive and
[3540.56 - 3546.16] only about our
[3543.32 - 3549.08] well-being the thing is is like there's
[3546.16 - 3550.92] a lot of smok and mirrors and there's a
[3549.08 - 3554.80] lot of agendas out
[3550.92 - 3558.52] there and it's not about the chronically
[3554.80 - 3561.04] sick it's just about how people can
[3558.52 - 3564.92] move you know
[3561.04 - 3567.64] up in the world of The Healing Art
[3564.92 - 3571.20] wasn't like this 30 years ago so much it
[3567.64 - 3574.96] wasn't like this 20 years ago but right
[3571.20 - 3577.36] now there's this game on kind of thing
[3574.96 - 3580.24] people are stepping on people and
[3577.36 - 3582.80] they're doing everything they can to
[3580.24 - 3586.44] just climb up in the ranks of the
[3582.80 - 3589.92] alternative social media market and
[3586.44 - 3591.92] they're running hundreds of ads and
[3589.92 - 3595.32] they're they're spending millions of
[3591.92 - 3597.40] dollars a month believe it or not yeah
[3595.32 - 3600.92] and they're doing all of this so they
[3597.40 - 3604.60] can be like I'm your Guru I'm your
[3600.92 - 3606.68] Guru and while all that's happening
[3604.60 - 3610.88] there's this food war going on about
[3606.68 - 3612.80] belief systems in the mix and in the end
[3610.88 - 3614.52] nobody cares about The Chronic Leo I
[3612.80 - 3617.32] could see it out there I see it out
[3614.52 - 3618.72] there every day they don't really care
[3617.32 - 3621.16] they want you to be
[3618.72 - 3622.76] fine they want your health to be just
[3621.16 - 3624.80] good enough to just buy all their
[3622.76 - 3626.36] programs or whatever it is and or
[3624.80 - 3628.80] whatever it is they selling and they
[3626.36 - 3630.80] want you to just be you just do it and
[3628.80 - 3632.60] shut up and no
[3630.80 - 3634.48] complaints because they don't want to
[3632.60 - 3636.92] know that you're so sick and you tried
[3634.48 - 3639.76] everything and it's not working they
[3636.92 - 3642.00] don't want to know that and they don't
[3639.76 - 3643.76] understand the exposures and the history
[3642.00 - 3646.48] of somebody and what they've been
[3643.76 - 3648.40] through I mean they're poaching mm info
[3646.48 - 3650.12] and acting like they're they do know

[3674.88 - 3681.12] know my team gets them every day they
[3678.48 - 3682.72] pour in and it's people being confused
[3681.12 - 3684.84] and they're just like I was just told
[3682.72 - 3687.44] that celery juice is bad for me and when
[3684.84 - 3689.08] you look into it the person that told
[3687.44 - 3690.96] them that Cel is bad for them are
[3689.08 - 3694.56] selling these like
[3690.96 - 3695.96] programs these multi-tiered programs and
[3694.56 - 3698.04] they're and they're doing all this other
[3695.96 - 3700.08] stuff it's actually
[3698.04 - 3700.92] deranged and that's what's happening out
[3700.08 - 3703.44] there you
[3700.92 - 3705.28] guys but look my job is to be a
[3703.44 - 3707.96] messenger to just tell people who are
[3705.28 - 3710.44] chronically sick okay about this
[3707.96 - 3714.76] information out there and how it's
[3710.44 - 3717.64] rigged because [ __ ] is rigged out there
[3714.76 - 3719.76] see PC says I saw an influencer the
[3717.64 - 3722.16] other day he claims that all physical
[3719.76 - 3724.24] illness can be healed with positive
[3722.16 - 3726.68] thoughts
[3724.24 - 3729.28] alone positive thoughts are
[3726.68 - 3731.40] critical we don't want negative thoughts
[3729.28 - 3734.36] eating our brain
[3731.40 - 3738.92] away they're not good for
[3734.36 - 3741.28] us but when someone's sick with chronic
[3738.92 - 3742.68] illness it doesn't mean that all these
[3741.28 - 3745.00] positive thoughts are going to be the
[3742.68 - 3748.28] answer to get them out of bed
[3745.00 - 3751.88] it can be critical to sustain help
[3748.28 - 3755.04] sustain them positive thoughts is
[3751.88 - 3757.76] important but I've seen people where
[3755.04 - 3760.16] like moms that have kids that are so
[3757.76 - 3763.44] sick with chronic illness you guys and
[3760.16 - 3767.28] the kids like the moms will tell me how
[3763.44 - 3770.24] positive the kids are and all they do is
[3767.28 - 3771.92] positive mantras and and happy thoughts
[3770.24 - 3773.92] while they're sick and
[3771.92 - 3775.52] suffering but they're sick and they're
[3773.92 - 3777.68] sick and
[3775.52 - 3779.88] suffering because there's so many other
[3777.68 - 3782.68] things involved it's not negative
[3779.88 - 3785.00] thoughts don't make
[3782.68 - 3787.16] somebody sick with autoimmune and
[3785.00 - 3790.68] chronic illness and fibromyalgia and
[3787.16 - 3793.32] hashimotos thyroiditis and ra and lupus
[3790.68 - 3794.84] and every symptom in between a negative
[3793.32 - 3798.32] thought doesn't do
[3794.84 - 3800.24] that but yes positive thoughts are got
[3798.32 - 3803.28] to have positive
[3800.24 - 3806.36] thoughts yeah totally get it what you
[3803.28 - 3808.92] said youy guys all right check out
[3806.36 - 3811.84] medical mean podcast at Apple podcast I
[3808.92 - 3813.56] put out three new episodes recently you
[3811.84 - 3816.24] probably already listened maybe you guys
[3813.56 - 3819.56] didn't some of you check it out onig
[3816.24 - 3821.88] vegan is not based on us it's based on
[3819.56 - 3821.88] the
[3823.60 - 3829.80] animals so it's a lot of different ways
[3826.92 - 3833.28] to think about that one right
[3829.80 - 3834.88] there so so vegan is not based on us
[3833.28 - 3839.52] it's based on animals
[3834.88 - 3842.64] animal so many people who claim that
[3839.52 - 3848.00] they are vegan run back to eating
[3842.64 - 3850.04] animals every single day um this is
[3848.00 - 3852.12] Infamous
[3850.04 - 3853.32] Infamous if that's the word of choice
[3852.12 - 3857.64] for this that
[3853.32 - 3860.48] works but so many plant-based people got
[3857.64 - 3863.56] sick and then they ran back to eggs that
[3860.48 - 3865.92] was the first thing they went back to is
[3863.56 - 3867.12] eggs
[3865.92 - 3868.36] and they're screaming that you have to
[3867.12 - 3871.56] be on
[3868.36 - 3875.20] eggs I'm not anti- plant-based I'm not
[3871.56 - 3878.72] anti-animal I'm anti-
[3875.20 - 3883.16] misinformation I'm anti- lacking
[3878.72 - 3885.88] tools I'm anti missing the
[3883.16 - 3888.92] knowledge and so you can heal
[3885.88 - 3893.20] plant-based and you can heal animal
[3888.92 - 3897.80] protein you can heal and medical medium
[3893.20 - 3902.52] info is so laxidasical
[3897.80 - 3905.44] in the sense where you can come into it
[3902.52 - 3908.16] and try any of the tools and customize
[3905.44 - 3911.04] it to what you want to do in your life
[3908.16 - 3913.44] that's how unbelievable it is it's not
[3911.04 - 3915.64] this one thing just got to do it this
[3913.44 - 3917.80] way and it's one size fits
[3915.64 - 3920.76] all it's the
[3917.80 - 3923.40] only thing out
[3920.76 - 3925.92] there that you can come into it any way
[3923.40 - 3928.12] you want and just start applying it and
[3925.92 - 3930.52] take it as far as you want to go even if
[3928.12 - 3933.64] they say they are vegan and they did it
[3930.52 - 3936.48] just for the animals not their health
[3933.64 - 3939.96] the minute they get sick or too many
[3936.48 - 3941.68] symptoms they run back to eating animals
[3939.96 - 3945.08] and they run back to their doctors for
[3941.68 - 3947.84] antibiotics to boot this is exactly what
[3945.08 - 3950.92] has happened every day and still does
[3947.84 - 3952.80] even people that go plant-based because
[3950.92 - 3954.92] of it I can't tell you how many times
[3952.80 - 3956.44] I've seen people that were plant-based
[3954.92 - 3958.08] that started eating animal products
[3956.44 - 3960.16] again and you know what they told me
[3958.08 - 3962.16] they told me that they they were vegan
[3960.16 - 3964.44] because they didn't want to hurt animals
[3962.16 - 3967.12] all of that but because they're sick
[3964.44 - 3969.40] they their body needed the protein I
[3967.12 - 3972.40] swear to
[3969.40 - 3974.72] God I heard that so many times if I had
[3972.40 - 3978.96] a feather for every time I heard that I
[3974.72 - 3980.92] would be able to fly that's how many
[3978.96 - 3982.68] times I've heard that from vegans and
[3980.92 - 3984.56] plant-based people that were vegan and
[3982.68 - 3987.12] plant-based because they were you they
[3984.56 - 3989.84] didn't want to eat any animals and they
[3987.12 - 3991.84] were against that and again against
[3989.84 - 3994.56] animal testing rightfully so they didn't
[3991.84 - 3997.28] want to eat any animals and then they
[3994.56 - 4000.32] used they actually got sick and they
[3997.28 - 4002.88] used the whole protein thing to justify
[4000.32 - 4004.52] it in their mind that their body was
[4002.88 - 4006.00] missing protein that must be why they're
[4004.52 - 4007.36] sick so they started eating animal
[4006.00 - 4010.04] products
[4007.36 - 4012.68] again oh my God have you heard someone
[4010.04 - 4014.60] do that yet I mean I've heard so many
[4012.68 - 4018.44] not judging them
[4014.60 - 4018.44] but I've heard it and I've seen it out
[4022.00 - 4026.76] there and I've seen a lot more than
[4027.60 - 4031.60] that another thing too is restrictions
[4030.76 - 4033.80] like
[4031.60 - 4036.52] restriction diets and stuff you know
[4033.80 - 4038.88] what you know what restriction
[4036.52 - 4040.60] is I'll give you a couple things you
[4038.88 - 4042.40] know with that oh also I want to say
[4040.60 - 4044.48] this also behind closed doors people
[4042.40 - 4045.56] don't always do what they should on
[4044.48 - 4048.28] social
[4045.56 - 4049.64] media even if they say they are vegan
[4048.28 - 4052.52] and they say they did it just for
[4049.64 - 4055.48] Animals yes even if they say they're
[4052.52 - 4057.72] vegan or they say they're animal basted
[4055.48 - 4060.32] and they're doing it a certain way it
[4057.72 - 4063.28] doesn't mean behind closed doors that it
[4060.32 - 4066.04] isn't different like the fly on the wall
[4063.28 - 4069.64] if you could be that fly on the wall and
[4066.04 - 4074.28] see what some people do after what
[4069.64 - 4077.44] they've said you would be like oh my God
[4074.28 - 4081.08] you can do a TV show on that
[4077.44 - 4083.00] stuff easily a whole series on everybody
[4081.08 - 4085.16] saying one thing and then behind closed
[4083.00 - 4089.48] doors they're doing something different
[4085.16 - 4092.84] it would be a hit show and a hit
[4089.48 - 4096.16] series and it happens every
[4092.84 - 4100.44] day Tara fruit fear restriction is
[4096.16 - 4102.84] restriction yeah there's fruit fear
[4100.44 - 4104.68] that's restriction there's sugar fear
[4102.84 - 4107.72] that's restriction out there there's the
[4104.68 - 4110.44] carb fear that's restriction
[4107.72 - 4111.84] carnivore that's restriction you didn't
[4110.44 - 4113.00] think the carnivore died restriction you
[4111.84 - 4116.08] know what's happening to the carnivore
[4113.00 - 4117.88] diet it's actually blown to shreds I
[4116.08 - 4120.28] predicted it years
[4117.88 - 4122.64] ago I think I haven't even on I have it
[4120.28 - 4124.60] on video I predicted it where it would
[4122.64 - 4126.80] fall apart because you can't just live
[4124.60 - 4129.28] on meat you can't just live on this and
[4126.80 - 4131.40] this only so they started adding things
[4129.28 - 4134.16] they added like lemon and then they
[4131.40 - 4137.04] added like honey and then they add it
[4134.16 - 4140.36] like berries this carnivore diet is now
[4137.04 - 4143.04] a keto diet carnivore diet is now back
[4140.36 - 4144.76] back is now an Atkins diet that's what
[4143.04 - 4147.52] the carnivore diet turned into it's
[4144.76 - 4150.60] crazy now they're adding orange juice to
[4147.52 - 4152.44] the carnivore diet so the carnivore diet
[4150.60 - 4154.84] is basically what gets this
[4152.44 - 4156.52] crazy and they're adding fruits now to
[4154.84 - 4159.00] the carnivore diet there is no carnivore
[4156.52 - 4160.72] diet you might get a few people left
[4159.00 - 4164.44] over and they're bumping in the walls
[4160.72 - 4166.00] they like I'm only on meat I can't I
[4164.44 - 4168.68] don't have any energy
[4166.00 - 4170.72] anymore and they're bumping in the
[4168.68 - 4173.16] walls you might have two or three of
[4170.72 - 4175.24] them left but everybody left carnivore
[4173.16 - 4176.20] and they're all there're doing fruit now
[4175.24 - 4179.04] with
[4176.20 - 4181.48] meat he says yep I remember a certain
[4179.04 - 4183.84] raw vegan influencers getting outed on
[4181.48 - 4187.04] social media for eating meat when the
[4183.84 - 4189.84] cameras were off I could name one
[4187.04 - 4193.36] influencer I'm not going to name that
[4189.84 - 4196.92] was caught eating fish when the cameras
[4193.36 - 4199.52] were off and they're a very well-known
[4196.92 - 4204.36] plant-based influencer and they were
[4199.52 - 4204.36] caught eating fish when the cameras were
[4204.96 - 4209.00] off
[4207.36 - 4211.12] yeah
[4209.00 - 4212.36] exactly but back to the carnivore thing
[4211.12 - 4213.24] I can't help it I got to talk about that
[4212.36 - 4216.08] a little
[4213.24 - 4218.88] bit
[4216.08 - 4220.60] yep the carnivore thing is like dead now
[4218.88 - 4222.36] there's only a few left over just eating
[4220.60 - 4223.68] meat everybody's now brought fruit into
[4222.36 - 4225.12] the carnivore diets it's not the
[4223.68 - 4228.00] carnivore diet
[4225.12 - 4230.04] anymore but restrictions are like all
[4228.00 - 4231.68] those things I was saying intermittent

[4247.24 - 4249.48] until
