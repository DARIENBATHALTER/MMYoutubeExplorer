mold exposure

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:46,819
mold exposure shots

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,840

forewarning man

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,180
telling you right now I've had the mold

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,599
exposure shot before

38
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,340
it's not the tastiest shot you be the

39
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,760
judge of it that's all I can tell you

40
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,099
right now you be the judge of that shot

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,660
and the taste of that shot

42
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,239
because that shot

43
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,459
doesn't taste sweet

44
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,280
doesn't taste yummy

45
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,040
it's not the best tasting shot

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,860
but that shot is rigged and it's it

47
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,519
levels you out and I'm excited about it

48
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,360
because it is a mold exposure shot

49
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,060
yeah and it's intense it's intense

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,159
but sometimes you need the intense stuff

51
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,300
you're gonna battle the mold exposure

52
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,800

85
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,340
moldy food and moldy food isn't the

86
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,560
worst problem unless it's moldy meat

87
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,460

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,300
in the medical medium Community there's

190
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,480
been a lot of advertising from the

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,760
Sharks a lot of heavy money lenders

192
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,060
behind it pushing

193
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,640
other juicers people buy the juicers

194
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,580
they don't squeeze as much juice out and

195
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,200
then you have to buy double the produce

196
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,040
and the juicer doesn't pay for itself

197
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,040
this is the mm 1500 20 off it pays for

198
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,740
itself it has the compression it

199
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,680
actually squeezes the crap out of the

200
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,080
juice you use less produce you save

201
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,839
money the money goes back into your bank

202
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,839
and then you can buy more produce

203
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,399
it eventually pays for itself the juicer

204
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,620
that's my experience and that's other

205
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
people's experiences but there's some

206
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,060
juicers that are tricky they'll say

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,860
things like oh for large amounts of

208
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,839
juicing that's silly it's all the same

209
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,940
you're still juicing it all and it still

210
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:59,640
ends up in the same place it's a scam

211
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,260
the other scam is you know this juicer

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,880
works this way this way but they don't

213
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,760
get it it's a lot of metal in those

214
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,220
juicers that's one problem the other

215
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,899
problem is all the juice escapes nobody

216
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,000
gets it you have to run a lot more

217
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,560
produce in it I don't want to be the

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,540
juicer guy screaming about a juicer

219
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,279
every 10 minutes but when I go quiet and

220
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,040
I don't talk about the juicer for a long

221
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,200
time the Sharks come in and they take

222
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,839
advantage of people and they rip them

223
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,920
off and that's what's happened so what I

224
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,380
recommend

225
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,480
is since that's the route somebody's

226
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,339
gonna go if you're looking to save money

227
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
you're looking to buy less produce for

228
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,980
what you need to do and your juices then

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,160
look into the mm 1500 or 900 save up

230
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,320
whatever it's 20 off wait for the sales

231
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,260
when they come on whenever they do

232
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,000
that's my recommendation and I haven't

233
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,500
talked about the juicer forever and

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,200
that's what happened I can't be

235
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,760
everywhere at all times and I can

236
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,839
literally I'm trying to get the books

237
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,779
written trying to get this information

238
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,820
to you in the minute I like let one

239
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,440
thing drop for a little while people get

240
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,839
screwed over and it's the saddest thing

241
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,180
I've ever seen it's just as I don't even

242
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
know what to say so medical medium brain

243
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,000
shots absorb quickly into the blood

244
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,220
vessels and they rush to the brain

245
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,399
rush to the brain

246
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,920
that is what they do you experience it

247
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,959
for me for you it could be the first

248
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,560
shot I mean the first sip of the shot

249
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,320
for me it's the second sip every time

250
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,360
it's always the second sip for me so

251
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,800
when I'm doing the shot of course you

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,220
could send your shot down in one shot

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,519
like that boom you got it down there but

254
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,220
what I do is I sip the shot so I'm like

255
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,700
sip the first Sip and then I do the

256
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,160
second Sip Sip and boom it hits that's

257
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,200
for me is when it's starting to hit and

258
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,660
you like you'll probably feel it too on

259
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,100
the second shot

260
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,320
Allah Monica says I love my Omega Juicer

261
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,500
incredible I do too Sherry says love my

262
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,700
mega right I do too and so anyway when

263
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,320
it comes down to the brain shot

264
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,779
therapies they absorb quickly in the

265
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,459
mouth and it's incredible okay these

266
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,459
specially formulated shots have the

267
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:11,100
ability to reset and rewire the brain

268
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,220
so what the shots do

269
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,440
like the obsessive shifter shot betrayal

270
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,779
and broken trust shot

271
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,899
okay all the different shots what they

272
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:24,720
do is they help to reset and rewire the

273
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,300
brain the emotional sensors of the brain

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,360
is one place they help to reset and

275
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,240
rewire the emotional center of the brain

276
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,560
since one place now our brain gets

277
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,320
injured by toxins poisons junk garbage

278
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,019
pathogens metals

279
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,600
emotional hurt our brain can get injured

280
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,000
physically from all that the neurons can

281
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,100
get burned up so what the brain shot

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,459
therapies do is they rewire and reset

283
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,380
the brain they help to rewire and reset

284
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:57,540
the brain which is incredible people are

285
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,980
always asking me about it you sir right

286
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,360
they're you know they're always asking

287
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,220
me to they're like what kind of juicer

288
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,779
what kind of juice or whatever and so

289
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,880
the name of the juicer if you're if

290
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,980
you're you know the in the description

291
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,060
you'll see it in the bio bio you'll see

292
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,540
that the juicer mm-1500 or mm-900 see a

293
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:18,720
mega juicer mm1500

294
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:21,540
mm-900 20 off right now if you want to

295
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,139
know and here's the thing

296
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:28,440
you get dry pulp you guys you guys you

297
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,600
get dry pulp I'll show you today

298
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,240
and people are asking the comments I saw

299
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,220
that too you you when the dry pulp comes

300
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,540
out you squeeze everything out of that

301
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,399
produce

302
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,019
and you're saving money you're cutting

303
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,019
your costs for me it cuts it in half

304
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
almost cuts it completely in half for me

305
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,720
that's what it's done so it's like I buy

306
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,519
less of everything that juicer pays for

307
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,680
itself it's like incredible that's why

308
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,899
that company is why I've endorsed that

309
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,880
company fully endorsed them the heck

310
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,579
yeah I will

311
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,100
you know and so it's important to know

312
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:05,100
so the mold exposure shot

313
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,079
okay is really potent and you're gonna

314
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,300
feel it you're gonna you're gonna feel

315
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,220
okay here's a question Angie says do the

316
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,079
ingredients contain binders to fully

317
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,360
remove the mold from the cellular level

318
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,820
my functional medicine doctor needs us

319
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,480
on good binders too charcoal Etc

320
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:23,339
charcoals charcoal doesn't remove things

321
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,660
and that's the misinformation out there

322
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,459
and

323
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,839
no disrespect to the functional medicine

324
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,300
doctor

325
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,480
if you read the brain saver books

326
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,519
you'll learn what charcoal does

327
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,740
it suffocates the lining of the

328
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
intestinal tract not allowing nutrients

329
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,519
to pass if you're on charcoal long term

330
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
long term

331
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,660
you'll get so nutrient deficient your

332
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,000
hair will fall out everything will go

333
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:50,940
wrong in a year or two and it'll be a

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,100
nightmare I talk about it in the books

335
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,980
charcoal is madness the heavy metal

336
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,500
detox smoothies in the books

337
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,959
really cleans up the intestinal tract

338
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,360
and crosses the blood-brain barrier

339
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,440
getting Metals out but also cleans up

340
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,560
things that shouldn't be in the

341
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,959
intestinal tract and on a cellular level

342
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,600
powerful cleanses right here in these

343
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,800
books but the point I'm trying to say is

344
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,019
charcoal is a mishap it started in

345
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,120
conventional medicine

346
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,519
and then it went to alternative medicine

347
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
because alternative medicine didn't know

348
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,000
how to break away from conventional

349
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,940
medicine on that one

350
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,860
so people who are all alternative

351
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,560
they get wrapped up with old

352
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:37,920
conventional medicine standards charcoal

353
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
was an old conventional medicine Theory

354
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,300
of possibly trying to remove something

355
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,399
from the intestinal tract with no

356
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,899
science behind it that shows it

357
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,240
got to be careful with the charcoal

358
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,800
thing I'm just being straight up if you

359
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,300
take charcoal on a regular basis because

360
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,699
you think you're cleaning something up

361
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,620
no disrespect for any practitioners or

362
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:58,440
doctors or anybody well you think you're

363
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,139
cleaning something up with charcoal

364
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,699
what happens is the charcoal sticks to

365
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,760
the lining of the intestinal tract for

366
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:08,820
weeks suffocating good bacteria and

367
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:11,339
suffocating the cells of the intestinal

368
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,339
lining so nutrients don't easily pass

369
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,380
through into your hepatic portal vein up

incredible Kirsten that's what I want it

407
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,900
to be that's what I live for that's what

408
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,360
I was born for that's why I received the

409
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,640
messages at age four about all this

410
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,220
that's why I was given that the gift

411
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,780
that actually here a voice which is

412
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,280
really a gift for you guys it's not a

413
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,840
gift for me it's a pain in my butt but

414
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,059
it's a gift for you guys to have this

415
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,080
information it's why I'm hated so much

416
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,320
too

417
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm hated so much

418
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,880
but yet but yet the books are the the

419
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,100
most selling Health books in the world

420
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,740
eight years running now but yet I'm

421
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,840
hated because people just don't like

422
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,059
knowing where I get the information it

423
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,160
drives them insane

424
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,200
I take up real estate in so many

425
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,640
people's heads out there that hate me I

426
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,620
just take up all the real estate in

427
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,820
their minds in their heads they don't

428
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,919
understand how all the new information

429
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
can constantly keep on pouring out from

430
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,700
over here

431
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,020
and they poach it whenever they can and

432
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,600
they try to step on my face while

433
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,700
they're doing it but either way the

434
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,980

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,840
sick group you guys they're working

555
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,179
they're being productive they're

556
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,740
exercising they're playing all day they

557
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:09,780
have all their Privileges and they're

558
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,860
getting all their self-care 24 7. That's

559
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:17,100
The Not So Sick group right

560
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,620
those who are frightfully ill those for

561
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,340
whom each day is about surviving is

562
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,340
another group

563
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,740
which was all for medical medium

564
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,900
information to heal and help all these

565
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,659
decades the group that really was

566
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,659
suffering that's a big deal

567
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,880
this increase in sickness like never

568
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,220
before is only going to keep developing

569
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,520
so are we evolving in the right

570
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,520
direction

571
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,679
so are we moving forward or backwards

572
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,740
are our physical bodies any different

573
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,539
than they were in ancient Rome 2500

574
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,720
years ago I'm reading brain saver you

575
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:59,720
guys

576
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,960
he came on here and we're in the medical

577
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,480
medium brain shot therapy class which is

578
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,580
really incredible

579
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,980
and if you believe that we evolved since

580
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,900
then we are evolving faster than what's

581
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,460
evolving around us no we're not because

582
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,140
we're sicker than ever before in our

583
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,460
history and that's the whole point check

584
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,539
this out talk about the immune system

585
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,200
because we're talking about mold

586
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:24,720
exposure shots today and I said mold

587
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,580
can trigger things it can lower the

588
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,000
immune system and saying that for 35

589
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:33,059
plus years it lowers the immune system

590
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,220
there's no way humankind could

591
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,960
physically evolve faster than any of

592
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,240
these forces against us that's why we're

593
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,799
all getting sick so we're having the

594
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,900
medals and we're having the chemical

595
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,059
exposure and we got the fragrances the

596
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,440
perfumes colognes air freshener scented

597
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:51,059
candles the detergents we got all that

598
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,280
nanotechnology that's in chemicals we

599
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,440
got the pesticides herbicides fungicides

600
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,299
we got all that junk being sprayed all

601
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,919
over us on our Lawns around our

602
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:01,320
buildings and apartment buildings and on

603
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,120
our highways we got stuff flying out of

604
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,559
the air we got mosquito spray being

605
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,760
dumped on us did you guys know that

606
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:12,780
every single town in the U.S is getting

607
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:16,440
dumped on by mosquito spray lethal spray

608
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,020
just coming out of helicopters and

609
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,539
drones and landing on everybody is that

610
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,360
nice and that's what they do but yet the

611
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,460
mosquitoes are still here hmm

612
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,679
it's kind of funny too because they also

613
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,900
genetically modify mosquitoes and they

614
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,179
let them out by the trillions so they

615
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,799
have a mosquito Factory does this make a

616
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,539
lot of sense they have a mosquito

617
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,340
Factory and they're letting out

618
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:41,520
trillions of mosquitoes that they breed

619
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:44,340
and then they're using you know

620
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,440
our money to make sure that they dump

621
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,539
lots of mosquito spray on every single

622
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,840
town and city in this country and around

623
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,760
the world huh but let's keep on breeding

624
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,340
and letting out trillions of mosquitoes

625
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,100
and then keep on dumping spray does that

626
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,320
sound like a great place

627
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,539
so we're up against all this stuff our

628
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,000
immune systems weren't made to put up

629
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,740
with all this BS doesn't say that in the

630
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,419
book put up with all this BS assist put

631
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,820
up with all these chemicals

632
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:13,919
either the number of varieties

633
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,200
are the outright quantity of these

634
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,500
chemicals including everything we talked

635
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,480
about with like radiation and everything

636
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,279
every time something foreign enters into

637
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,980
our body we're reading out a brain saver

638
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,200
enters into our body

639
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,080
our immune system has to gobble it up

640
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,120
and Gobble it up and Gobble it up

641
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,480
so our immune system the white blood

642
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,000
cell here has to eat it up so we're an

643
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,159
expo we're exposed to some type of mold

644
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,179
right because I got a moldy rag right

645
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:45,600
here

646
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,580
my robot wasn't happy about the moly rag

647
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,240
did you see that the robot was not happy

648
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:53,580
robot was very put off by The Moldy rag

649
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,220
so like this mold spot here that I have

650
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,220
when we get mold in us and it goes in

651
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,299
our body our white blood cells have to

652
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,039
eat it up

653
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,960
so our white blood cells have to go and

654
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,779
Gobble it all up whatever that mold went

655
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,880
to whatever it is

656
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:10,799
and it has to just eat it up and Gobble

657
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,419
it all up

658
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,820
Maria why did they create GMOs

659
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,700
mosquitoes

660
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,679
maybe to create the need for trillions

661
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,600
of gallons of mosquito spray on every

662
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,059
single town and city in the world

663
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,940
do you see what see how it works

664
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,080
who's creating those ketos uh mosquitoes

665
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,779
are created and they're dumping all the

666
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,880
stuff on you see how it works

667
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,059
so there isn't any real mold on this

668
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,880
towel I don't want anybody to be upset

669
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,679
there's no mold it's a Juice Spot it's a

670
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,740
green juice spot from juicing and it's

671
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,120
on this toggle so the towel is clean it

672
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,279
doesn't have any mold on it I know

673
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,620
somebody was upset see there's there it

674
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,260
is the green spot right there

675
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,940
smells like green juice

676
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,700
because I was making a shot this morning

677
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,220
okay you guys

678
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,320
so here we are your immune cells have to

679
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,440
gobble up any mold and any mold exposure

680
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,880
just like that so we need to know that's

681
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,720
how it works

682
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,720
and

683
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,740
let's go into it just a little bit if

684
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,260
you guys got a second I feel it I feel

685
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,520
that our halftime or half time is coming

686
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,440
up any second so I want to get this

687
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,440
information going oh

688
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,240
yeah my immune cell's falling apart

689
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,820
they weren't designed to fight off

690
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,159
engineered viruses either they weren't

691
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,779
designed to fight off chemicals but our

692
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,179
immune cells have to fight off

693
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:35,039
everything it has no choice it wasn't

694
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,620
designed to fight off radiation but it

695
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,360
has no choice but to fight it off and it

696
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,520
wasn't dissolved it wasn't sorry

697
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,220
designed to fight off certain varieties

698
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,679
of mold but yet it has to fight it off

699
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,360
so our immune cells have to go up

700
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,100
against so much that we're up against

701
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,980
all the time

702
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,779
so how long your blood cells can last

703
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,140
like this one that's Fallen apart on me

704
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,140
right now

705
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,080
it's up against all that mold and

706
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,760
everything how long a blood cell can

707
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,980
last

708
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,020
depends on how toxic a substance is and

709
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,360
how strong your immune system is so when

710
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,500
your white blood cell gobbles up a mold

711
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,140
Spore

712
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,840
or anything

713
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,899
it eventually dies or can die on the

714
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,399
spot and explode so then mold can become

715
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:22,620
a trigger

716
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,720
because as mold is knocking down our

717
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:28,140
immune system

718
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,299
something else inside of us can rise up

719
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,679
any kind of pathogens any other kind of

720
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,260
problems and then we kind of get

721
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,120
triggered we can get sick

722
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,620
depending on what kind of mold depending

723
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,480
on how strong your immune system is

724
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,640
depending on what else your body is

725
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,960
being protected by with your immune

726
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,720
system what else is happening inside

727
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,580
your body all of this matters and are

728
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,080
you on a lot of caffeine it could be

729
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,600
somebody that's like drinking a lot of

730
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,919
caffeine then that lowers the immune

731
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,840
system you could be somebody that's

732
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,279
eating a lot of chocolate that lowers

733
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,860
the immune system

734
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,960
you know what's crazy

735
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,100
uh the chocolate dealers the drug

736
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,899
dealers

737
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,340
they'll tell you that chocolate's great

738

for you they'll throw up they'll throw

739
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,299
out any science they can at you to tell

740
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,679
you that chocolate's great for you the

741
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:12,779
drug dealers right

742
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,899
but what you don't realize is chocolate

743
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:18,779
knocks down the immune system it hinders

744
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:20,760
the immune system knocks it down that's

745
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:23,159
why if you just if you eat too much of

746
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,120
it and just you're just gonna be like on

747
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,860
this like crazy cacao high right your

748
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,559
immune system is getting trashed when

749
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,539
you go on that crazy cacao ride it

750
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,980
knocks down the immunity the immune

751
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,620
cells

752
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,940
somebody compromised by all these

753
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,799
different pathogens chemicals and

754
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,899
everything else that's out there gets

755
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,580
all of a sudden exposed to mold it makes

756
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,740
it even harder and it makes it difficult

757
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,659
but then somebody else

758
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,940
that doesn't have any pathogens or other

759
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,440
compromises they expose to the same mold

760
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,240
they get exposed to the same variety

761
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,460
mold somebody else in the same house was

762
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,559
exposed to they may not get affected

763
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,820
some people get affected more than

764
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,580
others

765
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,510
mold is a mystery like that all depends

766
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,710

771
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,039
somebody said then why does your body

772
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,020
ask for so much more chocolate or so

773
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,399
much for chocolate why does our body ask

774
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,500
for chocolate

775
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:57,000
do you guys know the answer to that can

776
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,140
you guys answer that question for the

777
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,500
person

778
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:04,140
why does the body crave chocolate if

779
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,899
chocolate lowers the immune system you

780
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:10,580
guys got the answer right

781
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:10,580
you don't need me for that answer

782
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,419
I mean we know that those are short

00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,980
halftime Robinson said a smiley face

784
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,140
that's a short halftime that was really

785
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,720
short

786
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,700
because someone said I saw that it never

787
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,860
asks because of the caffeine addiction

788
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,240
Michelle L got it

789
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,860
you guys want to do the robot with me

790
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,480
let's hit the halftime

791
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,100

794
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,140
if you're if you can't stand up or

795
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,520
something you got to sit down just do it

796
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,320
sitting down

797
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,100

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,100

did you do the robot

804
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:27,899
okay

805
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,720
so what happens is yeah

806
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:34,200
it's about our immune system so mold

807
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,000
can eat up did you guys hold your breath

808
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,279
except because I hold my breath while

809
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,440
you're the robot the whole time

810
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,820
anyway maybe I should change that up

811
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,039
start breathing

812
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,200
when I'm doing the robot

813
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,220
but you can't stay super still if you do

814
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,279
that it's good like you're breathing

815
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,960
like I'm a robot that's alive I'm

816
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,220
breathing while I'm working

817
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,320
okay

818
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,419
Aubry says studies show when craving

819
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,120
sweets it means you're lacking in

820
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,220
essential nutrients really do those same

821
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,740
studies know why anybody's sick

822
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,679
to the same studies know why everybody's

823
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,240
got lupus Hashimoto's multiple sclerosis

824
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,700
or anything else

825
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,879
they need to read the caffeine chapter

826
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,800
in the brain saver books so you know

827
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,000
so when you're craving a chocolate bar

828
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,940
you're not craving something sweet

829
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,260
you're craving the caffeine the high

830
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,179
that's what you're craving a chocolate

831
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,460
bar you're craving all that caffeine

832
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,320
breaks down the immune system that's

833
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,240
what I was talking about before you read

834
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,260
the caffeine section in the brain saver

835
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,139
books

836
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,040
so the thing is with studies so studies

837
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,839
show

838
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,240
when creating sweets it means you're

839
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:41,639
lacking essential nutrients right

840
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:45,659
but studies don't know why anybody is

841
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:48,780
sick so it's it's a tough call there

842
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,300
you can be sick for 30 years and read

843
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,500
that study along with thousands of other

844
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:59,099
studies and stay sick for 30 more years

845
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,320
you can be sick for 60 years 70 years

846
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:04,920
your whole life's sick

847
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,720
with 10 different diagnoses labels a

848
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,480
hundred symptoms

849
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,400
and then you'll get the study shows why

850
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,380
you're craving sweets or the study shows

851
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,599
caffeine's good for you or the study

852
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,700
shows that now coffee is good for you or

853
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,740
the study shows that antioxidants are

854
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,300
good for you something or some whatever

855
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,420
it is

856
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,540
it doesn't it's not enough so you can't

857
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,119
it's like how do you trust the study

858
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,280
when they don't have one answer to why

859
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,599
anybody's sick it's really painful when

860
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,040
you think about it and then you don't

861
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,800
know how the study works and I talk

862
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,900
about that in medical medium books

863
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,060

I love that one I was doing that one

884
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,900
when Spirit of compassion gave me this

885
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,060
information and I was getting it all

886
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,460

chance to sleep

896
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,339

898
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,560

so you're talking about the immune

904
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,060
system we're talking about the mold

905
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:14,760
exposure how our immune system has to

906
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,520
gobble up the mold has to eat it up

907
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,560
right and how our immune cells they

908
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,880
weaken but we're up against so many

909
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,320
other things as I was talking about

910
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,940
earlier I know we gave you guys the

911
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,280

heart beat felt so normal last night I

951
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,380
felt so good this is what I wanted

952
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:00,240
this is what I was promised

953
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,660
when I was taking the information down

954
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,760
for the brain shot therapy for the books

955
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,280
from Spirit of compassion

956
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,480
I was promised you guys would get some

957
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,640
healing done

958
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,040
from these brain shots

959
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,480
that's what I was told that's what I was

960
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,720
promised

961
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,540
I don't like broken promises

962
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,240
I don't like being told something that's

963
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,220
not going to happen and and it does in

964
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,020
when SOC tells me

965
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,579
like The Meta like the medical medium

966
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,380
heavy metal detox cleanses are going to

967
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,800
get the metals out they do and they have

968
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,180
I I know people I know doctors

969
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,400
that are seeing results in their

970
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,660
patients that's unreal by using the

971
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,119
medical medium heavy metal detox

972
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,060
cleanses right now out of the brain

973
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,740
saver books so

974
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,940
when it came down to the brain shot

975
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,579
therapy like and SOC was telling me

976
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,020
and I was writing it down how they give

977
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:57,300
instant relief and I was writing that

978
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,040
down and then how they absorb in the

979
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,560
mouth that I was writing that down

980
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,300
and then how the brain shots are

981
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,099
systematically synergistically put

982
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,200
together

983
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:08,880
and because of their combination they

984
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,320
can do this certain thing I was just

985
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,079
like oh my God this is incredible

986
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,000
instant results is what I want it to

987
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,460
happen and that's what was promised of

988
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,140
me promise to me many many will have

989
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,119
instant results and some will be getting

990
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,460
relief

991
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,660
that they noticed a little bit later so

992
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,940
that's another thing with the brain shot

993
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,859
therapy so here's how it works

994
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,200
many people are going to get instant

995
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:35,099
results I will tell you this you will

996
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,680
feel something instantly no matter what

997
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,599
the results can come later through the

998
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,880
progression of the cleanse 10 day 20 day

999
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,680
or 30 day the results can come later to

1000
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,540
how many you do a day it says it in the

1001
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,460
book all the details are in here the

1002
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,160
results can come

1003
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,859
even later and sneak up on you but

1004
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,320
you'll get you'll feel something

1005
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:57,240
instantly within like for me it's second

1006
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,680
sift every single time for you it might

1007
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,780
be after you had the shot and you sat

1008
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,579
there for five minutes but each person

1009
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,560
you're gonna get so you're gonna feel

1010
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:06,960
something

1011
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,300
Susan said I slept so soundly last night

1012
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,920
and feel rested for the first time in a

1013
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,960
long time since starting brain shots

1014
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,560
last week that's exactly what I'm

1015
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,359
talking about you're getting results

1016
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,040
and it's a week later and you're getting

1017
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,820
results

1018
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:26,520
Esther says I hated cilantro before I

1019
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,220
did the heavy metal detox movie and now

1020
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,619
I actually like it that's incredible

1021
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,500
used to gag drinking it because I would

1022
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:38,940
juice it separate from the smoothie

1023
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:42,000
now I put more in to get the taste that

1024
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,540
means your metals are dropping

1025
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,940
your chemical load is dropping

1026
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,339
I talk about that in the books Esther

1027
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,040
did you see it in here I talk about it

1028
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:55,740
in the book right here it's in the brain

1029
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,359
saver books I go into detail about how

1030
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,640
it works with cilantro and how you can

1031
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,700
hate the taste to begin with be totally

1032
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,440
repulsed by it and then you start to

1033
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,220
heal and get the metals and chemicals

1034
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,560
out

1035
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,359
but doing the heavy metal detox smoothie

1036
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,220
or cleanse and then what happens is all

1037
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,540
of a sudden you like the cilantro and it

1038
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,040
gets better and it gets better and it

1039
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,040
gets better how incredible

1040
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:22,500
so much good information to talk about

1041
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:24,980

1042
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,980
let's go

1043
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:29,160

okay with this

1048
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,320
Enlightenment is not about being

1049
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,880
all-knowing Enlightenment is the freedom

1050
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,680
to be at peace before you have because

1051
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,540
you have full control over what resides

1052
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,640
inside of you

1053
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,500
and inside your brain since we don't

1054
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,760
have control about whatever resides out

1055
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,480
there because that's what happens you

1056
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,160

1057
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,780

1058
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,000
outside world

1059
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,579

1061
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,680

00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:13,740
add these steps to your normal eating

1107
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
routine so if you guys have a normal

1108
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,560
eating routine whether it's a medical

1109
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,819
media meeting routine maybe you're

1110
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,920
somebody that came here and you're like

1111
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:21,300
well I'm on this other eat better diet

1112
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,440
out here

1113
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,859
and

1114
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:29,760
you can still bring in your brain shot

1115
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:31,619
but keep in mind there's a scale

1116
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,560
you might be bringing in the brain shot

1117
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,020
and it's helping you to battle

1118
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,000
your caffeine addiction

1119
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,859
your apple cider vinegar addiction that

1120
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,060
you don't know you even have

1121
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:45,000
right

1122
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,920
you're really really high fat diet

1123
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,680
whatever it is that you're doing

1124
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:52,200
your bad supplements like charcoal and

1125
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,700
whatever chlorella and whatever else

1126
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,099
you're doing that's actually bad for you

1127
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,500
and then you're doing the brain shot

1128
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,720
therapy so now you're about your brain

1129
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,339
shot therapy is actually not only trying

1130
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,560
to give you instant relief but it's

1131
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,880
battling all this other stuff that's not

1132
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,920
good for you

1133
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,280
Jeanette says I'm buying these books as

1134
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,020
gifts for everyone for Christmas yes

1135
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,819
amazon.com I think they're 40 off right

1136
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,819
now at Amazon us

1137
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:22,740
so somebody said Tammy says I've done

1138
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:25,020
the four day brain shots and this is the

1139
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,900
first Monday in years I'm not feeling

1140
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:30,720
brain dead at work

1141
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,520
that's absolutely incredible

1142
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,200
so it's two books if you're buying them

1143
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:37,500
for gifts just so you know there's the

1144
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,420
brain saver brain saver protocols be

1145
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,400
prepared they're heavy

1146
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,380
they had to be split in two books their

1147
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,540
one book publisher could not put it out

1148
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,520
there it'd be a 10 pound book

1149
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,220
see celery healing says I've been taking

1150
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,060
the energy shot and feeling my energy

1151
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,060
come back

1152
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,040
that is miraculous stuff that's Miracle

1153
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,920
stuff

1154
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,359
that's what all this is

1155
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,640
and I'm not naive like I was naive when

1156
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,920
I was younger about something else say

1157
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,540
Sophie's healing said that this shots

1158
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,540
are true miracles

1159
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,960
I was naive when I was younger I thought

1160
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,180
everybody once you have the answers the

1161
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,099
whole world will just have parades over

1162
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,440
it you know and celebrate but that's not

1163
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,200
how the world works it's an evil world

1164
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,260
see um Brenda says instant starting

1165
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,720
instantly started laughing after the

1166
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,900
portrayal and broken trust shot and had

1167
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,599
the biggest smile that I've had in years

1168
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,760
incredible

1169
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,579
that's amazing

1170
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,880
all after an emotional blow after work

1171
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,380
my God that's incredible so you had this

1172
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,140
laugh attack

1173
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,839
from that shot all after a really hard

1174
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:56,099
day at work with an emotional blow so as

1175
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,660
I was saying before you guys I was

1176
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:00,420
really naive when I was younger I

1177
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,880
thought that since I was hearing this in

1178
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,880
incredible voice that was giving me

1179
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,500
Advanced Medical information about how

1180
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,260
to heal and about how the world works

1181
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,200
and everything else I thought for sure

1182
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:16,140
that the whole world would just want

1183
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:19,079
what's here but I learned that's not how

1184
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,540
the world works the world is crafted to

1185
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,579
condition people and brainwash people

1186
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,339
and confuse people so they can't always

1187
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,660
get the answers so I realize now I'm not

1188
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,040
naive about it there's a lot of people

1189
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,319
that are never gonna

1190
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,579
get these books in their hands billions

1191
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,079
of people in the world and they're just

1192
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:36,240
not going to experience this and it's so

1193
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:41,339
sad I just I have to live with it

1194
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,339
so we're at let's go to page 4 49.

1195
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,079
we're in the exposure shots you guys and

1196
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,940
we're doing the mold exposure so if you

1197
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,280
just got here medical medium brain shot

1198
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,740
therapy right

1199
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,720
we're in the cleanse challenge we're on

1200
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,400
day five we're doing the mold exposure

1201
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,380
shot now I'm in exposure shots here I'm

1202
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,480
talking about this area these brain

1203
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,819
shots can be administered before an

1204
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,960
exposure if you know you're going to a

1205
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,160
friend's house and you're concerned

1206
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,839
about a little mold at your friend's

1207
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,060
house take this shot

1208
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:10,560
during an exposure too like you're

1209
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,300
living in a situation where you got mold

1210
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,339
around you just get the stuff out and do

1211
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,859
the mold mold shots

1212
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:20,040
the mold exposure shot

1213
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:22,260
Tyra says the shots hit me about two

1214
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,060
days after I take them and I hear that a

1215
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:27,240
lot by people too it can happen a couple

1216
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:30,839
days you feel nothing at first then by

1217
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:33,240
day two dramatic change agitation gone

1218
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:35,160
and attention span increased that's when

1219
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:36,780
they're working on a deeper level that's

1220
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,579
when they're that's incredible and

1221
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,740
that's how it works

1222
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:42,780
Melissa said I thought the mold exposure

1223
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:45,180
shot would hurt my stomach because of

1224
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,880
all the Rosemary indeed there's a lot of

1225
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:50,220
Rosemary but it didn't hurt at all it

1226
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,339
was strong but I still liked it God

1227
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:54,960
bless you that you like the shot I'm

1228
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:58,260
probably not gonna like mine because I

1229
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,339
had one before and I went

1230
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,339
because it's strong

1231
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,599
mold exposure shot let's hit it

1232
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,040
here we are you guys so let's start

1233
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,480
making the mold exposure shot but I'll

1234
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,819
talk about it for a quick second as well

1235
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,680
you're visiting somebody who's living in

1236
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:16,200
a moldy house or building you're working

1237
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,060
in a workspace that's moldy you're

1238
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,460
inhaling mold off of another person's

1239
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,960
clothing say you had a bunch of wet Rags

1240
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,119
that were sitting somewhere in the

1241
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,040
corner of your house you didn't know

1242
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,540
about it and I don't know we're on the

1243
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,060
front porch or wherever you're living

1244
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,859
and you smell the mold and you can take

1245
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,500
the shot and do it

1246
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:37,079
hope for healing said I feel immediate

1247
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,880
results incredible I get hit with a

1248
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,800
feeling no matter what when I'm taking

1249
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,800
the second sip sometimes the first sip

1250
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,660
so let's go into it let's start working

1251
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,660
on it

1252
00:50:51,900 --> 00:51:00,119
let's get the juicer out

1253
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:02,579
so once again the mm-1500 20 off

1254
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,900
find if you have a juicer already it's

1255
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:06,240
not going to squeeze out as much juice

1256
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,000
as this one will I've tried them all

1257
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,920
they don't so keep in mind when you buy

1258
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,020
less produce or you juice less produce

1259
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,960
or you buy produce and you get more

1260
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:18,180
juice you save money it's money back in

1261
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,339
the bank the one thing I said since the

1262
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,800
beginning of the mm-900 and the mm-1500

1263
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:24,599
is it pays for itself

1264
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,880
I haven't talked about the g-shirt in a

1265
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:28,859
long time and because of that the juicer

1266
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,380
sharks all came into the medical meme

1267
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:33,240
Community sold people bum juicers in my

1268
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,160
opinion because they're juicers that

1269
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,800
don't squeeze out that much juice and

1270
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,099
they're all gimmicky it's sad but true

1271
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,900
and the rising cost of food

1272
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,240
the whole point is the reason why I

1273
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:47,280
backed up and endorsed this user was

1274
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,980
because of the rising cost of food

1275
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,660
because they figured out a way to create

1276
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,880
more compression

1277
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,819
to make sure that we squeeze more out of

1278
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,559
stuff twenty percent off mm-1500 but

1279
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:01,020
it's not all omegas it's just the

1280
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,359
mm-1500 900 but I want people to know

1281
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,500
because I feel bad and then I feel

1282
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,900
guilty

1283

know

1517
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:19,500
because I know that here's what's crazy

1518
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,839
about it the Sharks out there pushing

1519
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:23,579
juicers on the medical meme community

1520
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:25,680
that that are totally ripping them off

1521
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:27,900
they say all these things that actually

1522
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,760
like oh here's this what does but that's

1523
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,920
a joke look at this

1524
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:35,940
that's dry pulp

1525
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:39,119
it's dust in my hands right here

1526
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:41,339
dust in my hands that means the juice

1527
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,839
was squeezed out that means you used

1528
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:45,240
half the ingredients you would have used

1529
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:47,640
in any other juicer that means this mm

1530
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,680
1500 is going to save people lots of

1531
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,079
money and pay for itself you can't say

1532
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,819
that about juicers out there

1533
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:55,260
