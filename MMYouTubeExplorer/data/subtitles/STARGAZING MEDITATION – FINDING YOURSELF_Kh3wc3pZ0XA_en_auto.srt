304
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,440
um anyway and look you guys

305
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
the stargazing meditation you definitely

306
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
want to try it

307
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,560
if you can because it's powerful for

308
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,519
healing the soul

309
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
powerful to heal anxiety

310
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:00,880
depersonalization

311
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,360
depression even ocd it's really a power

312
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
packed kind of thing that turns our

313
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
lives around

314
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
the reason why is because our souls they

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,120
get

316
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
injured down here you know when someone

317
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,760
betrays you

318
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,959
when someone you know you know uh messes

319
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,720
with you okay

320
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,320
when they mess with you you know

321
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
emotional struggles i call them

322
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
emotional bullets when emotional bullets

323
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
are being

324
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,240
you know shot at you in the whole bit

325
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
when those emotional bullets are flying

326
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,839
at you and stuff

327
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,680
and so we get hurt along the way here

328
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
and our soul gets kind of like a little

329
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,240
beat up from it and you know that what

330
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,959
i'm talking about

331
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,800
broken relationships broken friendships

332
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
over the years or something happens and

333
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,000
the next thing you know it you're like

334
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
i don't really feel like meeting

335
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
somebody i don't feel like moving

336
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,279
forward with my life

337
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,440
you know i'm scared i got fear you know

338
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,560
you're just you're feeling beaten down

339
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,240
well the whole point um maddie says

340
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,000

are

344
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,240
but our soul gets tattered and beaten

345
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,880
out beaten down

346
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,800
and broken down a little bit we get you

347
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,240
know to our last tether we get kind of

348
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,560
frayed down here

349
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,440
and the star gazing meditation

350
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,480

351
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,880
