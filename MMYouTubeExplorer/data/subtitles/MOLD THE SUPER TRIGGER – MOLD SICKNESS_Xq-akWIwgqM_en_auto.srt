7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,960
the reason why i call it that because it

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
has really

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
caused a lot of trouble with a lot of

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,279
people and it could make us go crazy in

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,279
such a

12
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,119
in such an intense way i've actually

13
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,400
talked to a friend recently had intense

14
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,760
mold exposure

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,240
and it really triggered everything

16
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
in this friend as far as fatigue and

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,040
aches and pains

18
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,360
and just oh my god the brain fog that

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
my friend deal has dealt with with it

that we deal today

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
carpet

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
nobody really wants to know about it

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,520
unless you're living with it and then if

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,320

29
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
and they kind of don't get it and they

166
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,080
don't get what that means so what does

167
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
that mean you got to move out

168
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
does that mean you have to find a new

169
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,600
place to live like what does that mean

170
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,520
and so the support for mold all on its

171
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
own and that's not even getting sick

172
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
and then when you get sick where you're

173
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
like yeah mold

174
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,720
made me sick and then friends are like

175
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,759
well did mold really make you sick i've

176
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
seen it where friends

177
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,880
question friends you know even family

178
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
members question family members but

179
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,199
friends question friends i've seen that

180
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
out there

181
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,479
seen doctors question patients and say

182
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
uh

183
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
this isn't from mold this isn't mold

184
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
didn't kind of cause this

185
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,680
this isn't probably a mold issue so i've

186
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,199
seen that over the years too now there's

187
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
more doctors that actually believe in

188
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
mold

189
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,759
that's good but as i talk about in the

190
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
episode they still don't know why

191
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
someone really

192
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
gets triggered in a way they do buy mold

193
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,120
and what's going on deep inside of them

194
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,120
you know

195
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,039

check these out at medical medium

211
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,479
podcasts at apple podcast if you haven't

212
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,080
heard these the mold one is what i'm

213
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,680
talking about today i might cover

214
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
neurological symptoms in a little bit

215
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,840
too

216
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
we're live right now if you guys just

217
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,400
came on um

218
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,280
totally live that's right it's the way

219
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
to do it

220
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,840
and so the mold today is not the same

221
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,039
mold as

222
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
yesterday the the mold in the years here

223
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,120
aren't the same as yesteryear

224
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,599
important to know the reason why is we

225
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
have thousands of super molds now

226
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,560
and they've gotten really strong because

227
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,440
fungicides are everywhere fungicides are

228
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,120
created by

229
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,520
you know the chemical giants they make

230
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,080
fungicides to try to kill the mold

231
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,319
and when they do that they make mold

232
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,560
stronger and then make a new mold and

233
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,000
mold adapts the minute you try to

234
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
exterminate it

235
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,479
with a fungicide it just adapts and it

236
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
gets stronger and that's what happens

237
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,160
and i talk about how

238
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
fungicide is sprayed on the highways

239
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,599
every single

240
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
highway at least in the u.s and probably

241
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,800
globally too

242
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
and i've heard it's in in other places

243
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,240
around the world they spray the sides of

244
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,520
every highway it's sprayed with

245
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,039
fungicides

246
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
um you know rest stops on highways

247
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,039
are sprayed with fungicides in inside

248
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
the rest stops it's just fungicides

249
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
everywhere

250
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,520
and it's always like this and new

251
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,160
clothes when you buy new clothes brand

252
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
new clothes

253
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
sprayed with fungicides got to wash them

254
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,960
and everything so

255
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
you know and people don't realize that

256
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,919
they try on new clothes all the

257
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
fungicides in there

258
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,919
and they get the air fresheners sent to

259
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,759
candles those got fungicides in them

260
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,520
clones and perfumes have

261
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,879
fungicides in them i talk about it in

262
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,319

of it how come

mold exposure is really serious it can

300
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,880
trigger off a lot of symptoms in people

301
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,640
it's a major trigger for illness and

302
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,839
that's what it does you know

303
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,440
uh gina says high anthony mold exposure

304
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,200
symptoms sound similar to my lyme

305
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
disease symptoms yes

306
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
they do that because lyme disease

307
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,040
symptoms are neurological

308
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,279
mold exposure can trigger any

309
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,800
okay just say you never had a diagnosis

310
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,880
of lyme disease say you never had a

311
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
diagnosis of some disease or illness or

312
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
symptoms

313
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
and what happens is when you get mold

314
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
exposure it can

315
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,640
trigger something inside of you and then

316
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
you can end up with a lyme disease

317
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,240
diagnosis for a lot of people that

318
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,480
happens too so it's not like

319
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
it's not like they they get lyme

320
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,720
symptoms they get diagnosed with the

321
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
lyme

322
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
you know diagnoses and never see mold

323
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,480
there's people out there that

324
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,160
get the mold first it becomes the

325
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
trigger and then they have the lyme

326
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
symptoms then they have the neurological

327
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
symptoms

328
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,320

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,800
fungicides are dropped everywhere

377
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,959
they're even dropped out of helicopters

378
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,839
they're dropped all over the place

379
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,240
they're they're

380
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,600
literally they're dropping fungicides on

381
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,360
us like yearly they

382
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,720
did side the highways parking lots

383
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,440
schools yeah schools they just

384
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,000
they just just they they they coat

385
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,320
playgrounds with fungicide in schools

386
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,079
and this is what they do and it's to

387
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,360
stop mold from growing

388
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
the chemical companies sell it to

389
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,880
everybody as a package deal

390
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
and then you just you just spray it

391
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,160
everywhere so everybody's spraying it

392
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
everywhere that's how it works

393
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
um all the institutions spraying it

394
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,000
everywhere this is how it's done

395
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,440
hospitals they spray it everywhere

396
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,200
fungicides everywhere

397
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,360
and then it creates super molds over

398
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
time molds that get a little crazy that

399
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,399
get

400
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,399
out of control and that's what we're up

401
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,200
against out there so information

402
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
very important information but i want to

403
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,760
talk about this

404
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,560
what mold does is mold lowers the immune

405
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
system

406
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,079
that's what it does mold lowers the

407
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,680
immune system

408
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,639
so that when it lowers the immune system

409
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,480
it triggers something inside of us

410
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
something that's already happening in

411
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,800
there

412
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,959
and that's why you can have a family of

413
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
five you can have a family of seven you

414
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,600
could have a family of three

415
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:15,040
a family of four and only one person

416
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,760
gets sick uh one person gets sick

417
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
and that's it so it's like well why is

418
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,399
mom sick

419
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,519
why is mom in bed suffering with fatigue

420
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,720
aches and pains

421
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,040
tingles and numbness ticks and spasms or

422
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,399
just

423
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,160
body pain and why is mom suffering like

424
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,480
that from mold exposure

425
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
and dad's not you know dad can eat the

426
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
mold it could be in the air

427
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
it could be do living in it all

428
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
breathing in it the kids are fine doing

429
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
the same thing and that that's how it

430
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,480
works

see you

506
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,399
hi anthony thank you for this episode

507
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,120
blown away super molds

508
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,560
scary that mold loves emf let's talk

509
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
about that for a little bit

510
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,759
so i can only scratch the surface you

511
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,480
guys of what

512
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
is in there but let's talk about the the

513
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,800
emf

514
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,480
and all that so molds they jive on a

515
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,800
frequency is what they do

516
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
they thrive on a frequency that's what

517
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
molds like to do so

518
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,360
and there's a reason for this because

519
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,639
molds

520
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,399
were tested in labs where there were

521
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,519
tremendous amounts of

522
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,480
frequency electricity emf

523
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,000
radio signals all of it so mold has

524
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,519
adapted to that it

525
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,959
it loves cell towers so mold loves

526
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,800
cell towers that doesn't mean throw away

527
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
your devices because that doesn't matter

528
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
cell tower is still sending signals

529
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,800
regardless if you have a device in your

530
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,639
hand or not

531
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,480
still a signal that's going everywhere

532
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,880
and molds love

533
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,920
these types of frequencies they love it

534
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
they love emf

535
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,520
they love radio frequencies they love

536
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,360
cell tower frequencies they love it all

537
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,919
so with that mold thrives on that so

538
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,600
when you break that frequency you got a

539
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
chance of actually breaking mold and i

540
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,480
talked about that in the episode

541
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,319
