[0.00 - 4.02] left and right
[2.10 - 6.24] what's the biggest
[4.02 - 8.34] and greatest of all the sickness
[6.24 - 11.58] neurological symptoms
[8.34 - 14.64] tingles numbness on the body aches and
[11.58 - 17.42] pains ringing in the ears pain and neck
[14.64 - 20.58] pain in the head trembles vibrations
[17.42 - 21.96] tightness of the chest you're at the
[20.58 - 24.20] pulmonologist now you're at a specialist
[21.96 - 29.40] now you have a neurologist anxiety
[24.20 - 32.04] depression blurry vision brain fog
[29.40 - 34.62] all burning tongue burning mouth pain in
[32.04 - 35.46] the gums big pain in the teeth pain in
[34.62 - 38.46] the back
[35.46 - 41.34] feet tremoring legs tremoring restless
[38.46 - 43.86] leg syndrome it's endless
[41.34 - 46.38] neurological symptoms
[43.86 - 48.24] are the biggest actually the biggest but
[46.38 - 50.88] you won't hear that out there
[48.24 - 52.74] I think it's suppressed I think the
[50.88 - 54.18] information is kept down
[52.74 - 55.80] I don't think
[54.18 - 57.42] I don't think the industry the health
[55.80 - 59.28] industry the medical industry wants
[57.42 - 63.12] everybody to know that neurological
[59.28 - 64.62] symptoms are the big bad wolf of what's
[63.12 - 66.12] happening out there
[64.62 - 68.22] it's where everybody's getting sick
[66.12 - 70.50] everybody's has a symptom everybody's
[68.22 - 72.36] struggling with something going on with
[70.50 - 73.92] neurological symptoms
[72.36 - 75.90] so I got the books in front of me I'm
[73.92 - 77.40] doing a q a
[75.90 - 78.72] I'm going to take a look at what's in
[77.40 - 82.02] here too so I want to talk about
[78.72 - 84.18] symptoms conditions these books
[82.02 - 85.14] have saved so many lives throughout the
[84.18 - 87.78] years
[85.14 - 90.54] people getting answers when they
[87.78 - 92.64] couldn't get any answers at all and
[90.54 - 94.32] right now here's what's happening
[92.64 - 96.42] there's millions of people out there in

[126.60 - 129.90] just starting their journey and getting
[128.28 - 131.94] sick if you guys just got on here I'm
[129.90 - 134.46] doing a q a I'm taking a look inside
[131.94 - 136.98] these books neurological symptoms are
[134.46 - 139.50] dominating right now
[136.98 - 141.38] they're the big ones crying fatigue
[139.50 - 144.48] syndrome fatigue
[141.38 - 145.86] mysterious fatigue all kinds of
[144.48 - 147.78] different neurological symptoms people
[145.86 - 151.32] don't realize something that medical
[147.78 - 153.06] medium termed neurological fatigue so
[151.32 - 154.14] many people are dealing with all of this
[153.06 - 157.50] stuff
[154.14 - 160.14] burning tongue twitching nose pain in
[157.50 - 162.60] the nose pain in the ears popping in the
[160.14 - 164.16] ears fluttering vertigo dizziness
[162.60 - 165.90] balance issues where they feel like

[165.90 - 171.66] boat I can go on and on all day
[169.44 - 173.16] panic attacks
[171.66 - 175.14] anxiety
[173.16 - 177.90] so many people are struggling right now
[175.14 - 180.24] but they're just starting their Journey
[177.90 - 182.78] newbies they're just starting to get
[180.24 - 185.34] sick and they're Doctor shopping
[182.78 - 186.90] practitioner shopping health coach
[185.34 - 189.18] shopping
[186.90 - 191.58] and they're going in the Merry-Go-Round
[189.18 - 193.62] and they don't know
[191.58 - 196.02] that they're actually answers out there
[193.62 - 197.82] that have gotten people with hundreds of
[196.02 - 200.16] symptoms better people that have 100
[197.82 - 202.56] symptoms more than 100 symptoms
[200.16 - 204.96] 50 symptoms and they've gotten better
[202.56 - 207.66] and recovered their life recovered
[204.96 - 209.52] themselves through the information in
[207.66 - 211.56] the medical medium books
[209.52 - 212.52] so I'm opening up these books for a
[211.56 - 214.56] little bit I'm going to talk about
[212.52 - 217.14] symptoms and conditions
[214.56 - 219.72] I'm excited to do so I want to be
[217.14 - 221.34] helpful today in any way I can
[219.72 - 223.68] because I know so many of you guys are
[221.34 - 226.08] struggling and still struggling many of
[223.68 - 227.88] you guys are recovering yourselves many
[226.08 - 230.88] of you guys here just fully recovered
[227.88 - 233.22] after doing years of medical medium when
[230.88 - 236.34] you already were sick for 10 15 20 years
[233.22 - 239.34] the medical medium books were this
[236.34 - 242.10] bright light for the person
[239.34 - 244.14] who's been sick for over a decade
[242.10 - 248.16] 10 20 years
[244.14 - 250.14] and so because you find the answers
[248.16 - 252.42] so I'm hearing symptoms and conditions
[250.14 - 255.78] and I love this book here
[252.42 - 257.16] this book is the brain saver book
[255.78 - 258.72] now if you're somebody just coming into
[257.16 - 261.18] this you'll be like which book do I get
[258.72 - 264.96] that's a great book medical medium
[261.18 - 267.60] New Edition is incredible live a rescue
[264.96 - 270.54] another Incredible Book right there too
[267.60 - 272.94] get them free at the library
[270.54 - 274.44] you can do that
[272.94 - 276.24] so
[274.44 - 278.52] so many people
[276.24 - 282.30] have problems
[278.52 - 284.82] Beyond just say a neurological tingle or
[282.30 - 286.98] numbness or an ache or a pain or jaw
[284.82 - 289.10] pain or dizziness or vertigo or ear
[286.98 - 292.50] popping or whatever so many people have
[289.10 - 294.12] addiction issues that they just can't
[292.50 - 295.98] get past
[294.12 - 297.90] whether it's an addiction to caffeine
[295.98 - 298.92] addiction to coffee addiction to
[297.90 - 301.80] chocolate
[298.92 - 302.88] addiction to food because you're under
[301.80 - 305.70] stress
[302.88 - 308.16] so so many people are are addicted to
[305.70 - 310.44] flavor they're addicted to MSG they're
[308.16 - 312.96] addicted to that
[310.44 - 315.48] that excitability they get from food
[312.96 - 318.00] that adrenaline surge
[315.48 - 321.00] and then there's so many people that
[318.00 - 322.68] also have skin problems like eczema and
[321.00 - 325.68] psoriasis
[322.68 - 328.14] psoriatic arthritis kind of combination
[325.68 - 331.68] of both and then you get people who have
[328.14 - 334.80] rosacea dermatitis and all kinds of
[331.68 - 336.24] other skin issues too so
[334.80 - 338.40] I'm looking right here and I'm looking
[336.24 - 340.56] through symptoms conditions in the brain
[338.40 - 342.90] saver book and I'll just run a few right
[340.56 - 345.30] here by you this is interesting like I'm
[342.90 - 347.40] just cutting through some of these
[345.30 - 349.80] so anemia is in here how many people are
[347.40 - 353.58] anemic so I just want to hit that a
[349.80 - 355.38] little bit so anemia is mysterious
[353.58 - 359.64] that's mysterious to the medical
[355.38 - 363.60] industry being anemic right so one thing
[359.64 - 366.00] people don't realize is that low iron
[363.60 - 368.64] in the blood
[366.00 - 370.20] a big part of that is low-grade viral
[368.64 - 373.56] infection
[370.20 - 375.08] some people have epstein-bars and other
[373.56 - 378.96] viruses
[375.08 - 380.28] Epstein-Barr tends to feed on iron so in
[378.96 - 382.32] a lot of people they're dealing with
[380.28 - 385.56] this anemia because they're dealing with
[382.32 - 387.30] a chronic low-grade viral infection
[385.56 - 389.28] and that's something that so many people
[387.30 - 391.14] struggle with that they'll never get an
[389.28 - 392.64] answer to but they'll never get that
[391.14 - 394.20] answer ever
[392.64 - 397.02] and they'll just be like dealing with
[394.20 - 399.60] their anemia not know how to fix it not
[397.02 - 401.58] know how to heal it
[399.60 - 403.20] so I'm looking through here too for all
[401.58 - 405.06] kinds of there's Alzheimer's I can see
[403.20 - 406.44] that there's
[405.06 - 410.06] um
[406.44 - 412.56] there's anxiety there's anxiousness
[410.06 - 415.50] arrhythmias a lot of people have heart
[412.56 - 418.56] palpitations and heart issues that are
[415.50 - 420.42] not physical in the sense where the
[418.56 - 421.98] heart has a problem how many of you guys
[420.42 - 423.60] have dealt with that like heart
[421.98 - 426.36] palpitations right you feel like you
[423.60 - 427.92] have a a fish that's flopping around in
[426.36 - 430.92] your chest
[427.92 - 434.58] good tachycardia and AFib
[430.92 - 437.88] ectopic heartbeat heart palp so many
[434.58 - 440.64] people are up against that all the time
[437.88 - 442.74] this question what's your take on Lupus
[440.64 - 445.02] and multiple sclerosis so if you look in
[442.74 - 447.36] medical medium book one you can even
[445.02 - 449.46] look at brain saver on that somebody's
[447.36 - 453.36] asking about lupus
[449.46 - 455.10] so I have Lupus in here and it talks um
[453.36 - 456.42] it talks about that in here too and
[455.10 - 458.76] multiple sclerosis there's a whole
[456.42 - 461.46] section here in multiple sclerosis
[458.76 - 462.84] that's a very important topic so what is
[461.46 - 465.24] my take on it
[462.84 - 468.06] my take is having an answer for multiple
[465.24 - 470.10] sclerosis that's my take it's something
[468.06 - 472.52] that you can't get anywhere else in the
[470.10 - 476.34] industry and that's Epstein-Barr
[472.52 - 478.02] Epstein-Barr is the cause of multiple
[476.34 - 479.28] sclerosis now you might be somebody
[478.02 - 481.14] though
[479.28 - 482.34] and have seen this there's other people
[481.14 - 484.92] out there that have had this where
[482.34 - 486.06] they're misdiagnosed with multiple
[484.92 - 488.58] sclerosis
[486.06 - 491.34] and they have a flurry of other
[488.58 - 493.86] neurological symptoms weakness in the
[491.34 - 495.78] limbs weakness in the legs weakness in
[493.86 - 498.36] the arms
[495.78 - 501.96] all kinds of vibrations and spasms in
[498.36 - 503.88] the arms ticks and they may get a
[501.96 - 506.46] multiple sclerosis diagnosis but really
[503.88 - 508.32] there's something else going on
[506.46 - 509.46] but then there's multiple sclerosis
[508.32 - 511.50] where
[509.46 - 515.10] the nerve sheath
[511.50 - 518.70] is physically damaged and they can see
[515.10 - 520.44] that so there's that option to is that
[518.70 - 522.92] there's that too that diagnosis that
[520.44 - 526.44] happens for people but in these books
[522.92 - 527.70] and in the medical medium new addition
[526.44 - 529.80] right here
[527.70 - 531.66] I talk about multiple sclerosis and the
[529.80 - 534.42] details of it and then I talk about
[531.66 - 536.58] lesions in brain saver
[534.42 - 538.98] which are really important too in brain
[536.58 - 541.20] saver protocols a lot of people have
[538.98 - 543.24] lesions they get diagnosed with multiple
[541.20 - 545.22] sclerosis but the lesion isn't causing
[543.24 - 546.84] the problem
[545.22 - 548.34] so the lesion
[546.84 - 551.82] in the brain
[548.34 - 555.24] on the nerve sheath on the spine is not
[551.82 - 556.92] why they're actually having problems
[555.24 - 558.30] they could be having problems for other
[556.92 - 560.94] reasons
[558.30 - 563.52] and so I go into detail on all kinds of
[560.94 - 566.40] black spots white spots calcifications
[563.52 - 568.92] in the brain all kinds of different Scar
[566.40 - 570.72] Tissue problems people have in their
[568.92 - 573.48] brain and brain tissue
[570.72 - 575.40] I talk about stains in the brain
[573.48 - 576.00] causing
[575.40 - 578.04] um
[576.00 - 579.84] causing dark doctors to actually
[578.04 - 582.96] misdiagnose
[579.84 - 585.24] multiple sclerosis or issues regarding
[582.96 - 587.76] that but when it comes down to Multiple
[585.24 - 591.06] Sclerosis if I was diagnosed with Ms I
[587.76 - 592.80] would be taking it on like a virus
[591.06 - 595.74] causing it
[592.80 - 597.72] and I'd be concerned about Metals too so
[595.74 - 600.60] when someone has
[597.72 - 603.54] a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
[600.60 - 607.08] that's usually a combination of viruses
[603.54 - 609.66] like Epstein-Barr and toxic heavy metals
[607.08 - 611.34] and I would take those two wands
[609.66 - 613.20] do what's right for you and what your
[611.34 - 616.74] doctor tells you but that's what I would
[613.20 - 618.90] do I'd go into the medical meeting books
[616.74 - 620.10] learn about a multiple sclerosis
[618.90 - 622.50] protocol
[620.10 - 625.56] so let's see if we can find one these
[622.50 - 627.96] books are just like vast textbooks of
[625.56 - 629.88] information so let me see I'll go into
[627.96 - 631.98] the protocols book right here
[629.88 - 634.46] and actually you can go in here too and
[631.98 - 634.46] find them
[636.66 - 640.92] so there's a couple of places you can go
[639.18 - 642.60] for multiple sclerosis you can go right
[640.92 - 644.66] in here
[642.60 - 644.66] things
[646.02 - 653.82] so somebody said the who or linking MS2
[650.58 - 656.46] I saw that okay down here I measure
[653.82 - 658.86] hi have MS and have been using medical
[656.46 - 661.80] medium information to heal just came off
[658.86 - 663.96] my Ms medication and was able to heal
[661.80 - 665.82] one of my brain lesions that caused
[663.96 - 667.02] double vision that's wild blueberry
[665.82 - 669.18] dreams
[667.02 - 670.98] on IG
[669.18 - 672.24] a lot of people first of all I'm proud
[670.98 - 674.96] of you incredible you're using medical
[672.24 - 676.80] meme information to heal your MS
[674.96 - 678.48] lots of people have healed their
[676.80 - 680.34] multiple multiple sclerosis different
[678.48 - 682.50] lesions with with the medical medium
[680.34 - 684.30] information it's all about chronic
[682.50 - 686.88] illness it's all about
[684.30 - 689.82] these very things multiple sclerosis on
[686.88 - 691.86] page 68
[689.82 - 695.22] right here
[691.86 - 699.36] so I'm in medical medium book one
[695.22 - 701.84] the new edition I'm on page 68 multiple
[699.36 - 701.84] sclerosis
[702.60 - 706.38] it is so packed with information this
[704.46 - 708.96] chapter
[706.38 - 710.76] it has so many details on how it even
[708.96 - 711.90] occurs what it really is like for
[710.76 - 714.90] instance I'm reading right here what
[711.90 - 716.76] multiple sclerosis really is
[714.90 - 718.44] medical communities believe multiple
[716.76 - 720.12] sclerosis is an autoimmune disease
[718.44 - 722.34] resulting from your immune system
[720.12 - 725.34] somehow confusing areas of your nerve
[722.34 - 728.40] sheath with Invaders and attacking them
[725.34 - 729.96] huge mistake by the medical industry
[728.40 - 731.70] sorry to say
[729.96 - 734.40] but it's a mistake
[731.70 - 736.68] it's a medical communities believe it's
[734.40 - 740.46] your immune system being confused and
[736.68 - 742.50] attacking your nerve sheath
[740.46 - 744.24] as I say in other chapters this is a
[742.50 - 746.52] philosophy that will hold back the truth
[744.24 - 748.26] in medical research for decades the
[746.52 - 751.20] human body does not attack itself
[748.26 - 752.82] pathogens are to blame so it goes on to
[751.20 - 754.32] how the Epstein bar creates multiple
[752.82 - 756.06] sclerosis
[754.32 - 758.16] and then there's sections in here like
[756.06 - 761.82] healing from multiple sclerosis
[758.16 - 764.34] it's packed so I'll read you a protocol
[761.82 - 767.46] really quick a little bit of it Mitchie
[764.34 - 770.28] says does it have epilepsy yes the Brain
[767.46 - 773.16] book does
[770.28 - 777.56] so in the brain books
[773.16 - 777.56] I talk about epilepsy is here seizures
[778.14 - 781.68] so if I had multiple sclerosis I would
[780.18 - 784.40] take this book
[781.68 - 784.40] right here
[785.82 - 790.56] and I would look at the protocol and the
[788.76 - 793.28] first thing in the protocol if you only
[790.56 - 793.28] did this
[793.32 - 796.80] the first thing in the protocol is
[795.36 - 798.90] celery juice
[796.80 - 800.94] if you're somebody and you're like well
[798.90 - 802.26] I don't know if I have multiple
[800.94 - 804.42] sclerosis but I have a lot of symptoms
[802.26 - 806.58] like this said hey you can always go
[804.42 - 808.80] this direction in this path but you also
[806.58 - 811.14] can find your symptoms in the Brain book
[808.80 - 813.00] specifically
[811.14 - 816.18] so it starts out with fresh celery juice
[813.00 - 819.30] work up to 32 ounces daily then work up
[816.18 - 822.66] to 64 ounces if possible
[819.30 - 825.78] so if someone has serious
[822.66 - 828.18] a serious diagnosis and struggles with
[825.78 - 830.58] multiple sclerosis
[828.18 - 833.34] that's what it says here now look what
[830.58 - 835.56] it says it says work up to
[833.34 - 837.12] work up to 32 ounces that means you
[835.56 - 839.88] could start at four ounces
[837.12 - 842.24] inserted six or eight ounces
[839.88 - 845.46] and that's what it says right there
[842.24 - 848.34] and then it goes through supplements it
[845.46 - 849.48] goes through dosages right here you'll
[848.34 - 851.22] see there's a bunch of different
[849.48 - 854.58] supplements in here and you could take
[851.22 - 856.80] it where when you read the supplement
[854.58 - 858.42] chapter you can see where you can start
[856.80 - 860.76] slow you can start with one or two
[858.42 - 864.36] supplements now I know there's a lot
[860.76 - 865.56] of talk out there about take supplements
[864.36 - 868.14] or not you don't need to take
[865.56 - 871.26] supplements to heal stay away from
[868.14 - 872.94] supplements you'll hear out there
[871.26 - 874.68] but there's a lot of confusion like
[872.94 - 876.54] which supplements are you talking about
[874.68 - 879.24] because you're talking about swallowing
[876.54 - 881.04] charcoal stay away from it if you're
[879.24 - 883.80] talking about
[881.04 - 885.78] you know drinking and swallowing Pearl
[883.80 - 887.52] powder and Soviet sodium bicarbonate
[885.78 - 888.78] yeah you shouldn't be doing it if you
[887.52 - 890.52] talk about supplements that are filled
[888.78 - 893.16] with natural flavors and citric acid and
[890.52 - 894.42] all kinds of toxic ingredients sure you
[893.16 - 896.60] don't want to be using that you should
[894.42 - 899.64] stay away from it but
[896.60 - 902.58] supplements are critical
[899.64 - 906.00] for people who need to customize and go
[902.58 - 907.32] further with their healing process
[906.00 - 909.12] this person
[907.32 - 911.04] is dealing with a host of problems so if
[909.12 - 912.72] somebody gets a diagnosis of multiple
[911.04 - 914.82] sclerosis or any kind of neurological
[912.72 - 916.62] problem they're also probably dealing
[914.82 - 918.42] with stress
[916.62 - 919.80] Financial issues all kinds of different
[918.42 - 923.76] issues
[919.80 - 926.28] maybe even emotional mental struggles
[923.76 - 929.70] all of the above
[926.28 - 932.58] and so it is critical to
[929.70 - 934.44] Venture into protocols if you need that
[932.58 - 936.12] now I tell people they can use the
[934.44 - 938.40] medical medium books and they can just
[936.12 - 940.62] focus on like the mono
[938.40 - 942.36] right the mono diet they can focus on
[940.62 - 943.74] the monoclans they can focus on the
[942.36 - 946.50] morning cleanse
[943.74 - 949.20] they can focus on the 369 they can focus
[946.50 - 952.02] on the 20-day cleanse whatever it is
[949.20 - 954.48] they can start there or keep that and
[952.02 - 957.78] then incorporate supplementation too
[954.48 - 959.70] but I've seen live saved when using
[957.78 - 961.26] supplementation
[959.70 - 964.26] properly
[961.26 - 968.40] in protocols that actually work I've
[964.26 - 970.02] seen lives get saved problem is in the
[968.40 - 973.08] industry out there's a lot of
[970.02 - 976.02] supplements being sold
[973.08 - 979.38] for a lot of stupid reasons
[976.02 - 982.14] and so it's a dog eat dog world
[979.38 - 983.46] there's a battle and a war out there for
[982.14 - 985.08] everybody
[983.46 - 986.34] and their grandfather to sell a
[985.08 - 989.52] supplement
[986.34 - 992.28] and what's lost is why are people really
[989.52 - 993.06] sick really what protocol do they really
[992.28 - 994.98] need
[993.06 - 998.12] those are the things that matter just
[994.98 - 998.12] having those details
[999.66 - 1004.46] um a couple different questions here too
[1002.18 - 1007.46] someone said
[1004.46 - 1009.80] yes please talk more about autism when
[1007.46 - 1011.60] kids it's an epidemic and it's only
[1009.80 - 1013.04] getting worse so medical meme
[1011.60 - 1015.08] information
[1013.04 - 1017.24] many years ago
[1015.08 - 1018.56] broke the news about toxic heavy metals
[1017.24 - 1021.56] in Mercury
[1018.56 - 1023.78] in book one and long before that so I'm
[1021.56 - 1025.22] in medical medium book one revised
[1023.78 - 1028.28] Edition right here
[1025.22 - 1030.50] New Edition and I have autism in this
[1028.28 - 1032.48] book a whole chapter on it so let's
[1030.50 - 1034.82] let's just go into that for a second
[1032.48 - 1036.62] guys if you guys have time to sit here
[1034.82 - 1038.18] with me I want to talk about some
[1036.62 - 1040.46] different conditions I want to look at
[1038.18 - 1041.72] some of your questions I want to be
[1040.46 - 1044.30] helpful
[1041.72 - 1046.22] I know I didn't finish about multiple
[1044.30 - 1048.26] sclerosis but there's so much to cover
[1046.22 - 1049.52] here and the informations here and I'm
[1048.26 - 1051.02] hoping that I'm still getting
[1049.52 - 1052.58] information that you can really learn
[1051.02 - 1055.24] from and glean from
[1052.58 - 1055.24] so let's
[1055.58 - 1059.72] find
[1057.26 - 1061.64] what's the best cleanse to do for Ms let
[1059.72 - 1064.06] me answer that in a second and I'm also
[1061.64 - 1064.06] going to find
[1066.80 - 1071.62] I find the autism section in here
[1074.06 - 1077.74] what I love about these books
[1079.10 - 1082.90] is they're so packed with information
[1089.96 - 1094.70] I see so many interesting things to talk
[1092.24 - 1097.16] about I'm actually like
[1094.70 - 1099.50] my mind is exploding right now is what's
[1097.16 - 1102.86] happening
[1099.50 - 1105.14] all right so ADHD
[1102.86 - 1107.12] and autism
[1105.14 - 1108.32] so you'll see right here down the corner
[1107.12 - 1111.80] I want to read one little thing really
[1108.32 - 1115.04] quick what causes ADHD and autism
[1111.80 - 1116.84] a popular misconception is that ADHD and
[1115.04 - 1118.22] autism are the result of a poor
[1116.84 - 1121.28] intestinal environment so you're going
[1118.22 - 1123.44] to hear that so if you have a child and
[1121.28 - 1126.32] you're going to seek help they're just
[1123.44 - 1128.90] going to be all about gut health
[1126.32 - 1131.86] I'm not saying that can't be helpful or
[1128.90 - 1134.78] not no judgment on any of it
[1131.86 - 1136.88] but some current thinking goes that in
[1134.78 - 1138.62] overproduction of candida yeast and mold
[1136.88 - 1140.84] and non-beneficial bacteria are to
[1138.62 - 1143.54] filling for children it's hyperactive in
[1140.84 - 1144.86] attentive impulsive or anti-social
[1143.54 - 1147.32] Behavior
[1144.86 - 1149.06] and then improving intestinal Flora will
[1147.32 - 1150.86] improve children's brain health and
[1149.06 - 1152.84] alleviate their symptoms so every mom
[1150.86 - 1154.70] goes down this course eventually if they
[1152.84 - 1157.16] leave the conventional wisdom every mom
[1154.70 - 1161.06] will get child with autism end up try
[1157.16 - 1163.34] and ends up traveling down that course
[1161.06 - 1167.06] this theory is a distraction from what's
[1163.34 - 1169.22] really in play that's a bold statement
[1167.06 - 1172.00] by SOC in this book right here I'm
[1169.22 - 1172.00] talking about autism
[1172.04 - 1176.66] anybody can benefit from cleaning up
[1174.38 - 1179.24] their gut health even if they're unaware
[1176.66 - 1182.36] how or why
[1179.24 - 1184.10] in the case of ADHD and autism trying to
[1182.36 - 1186.56] improve the intestinal tract environment
[1184.10 - 1190.46] with probiotics and probiotic rich foods
[1186.56 - 1193.84] is a good intention that's peripheral
[1190.46 - 1193.84] you guys hear that that's peripheral
[1194.96 - 1199.34] it it doesn't address the true
[1197.12 - 1203.00] underlying cause of ADHD and autism
[1199.34 - 1207.50] toxic heavy metals
[1203.00 - 1211.64] the true underlying Beast of autism and
[1207.50 - 1213.38] ADHD toxic heavy metals if you say oh
[1211.64 - 1215.00] I've heard that already
[1213.38 - 1216.26] you're welcome
[1215.00 - 1217.58] I've heard that already you're not
[1216.26 - 1219.98] telling me something new medical medium
[1217.58 - 1221.72] why am I watching you you're welcome
[1219.98 - 1225.50] you're welcome
[1221.72 - 1228.32] Decades of my work you're welcome
[1225.50 - 1231.38] specifically ADHD and autism are born
[1228.32 - 1233.54] from primarily Mercury plus aluminum
[1231.38 - 1235.82] that settles in the brain's midline
[1233.54 - 1238.88] cerebral canal
[1235.82 - 1240.92] which divides the left hemisphere
[1238.88 - 1242.78] than the right hemisphere the Mercury
[1240.92 - 1244.58] and aluminum can also be in other areas
[1242.78 - 1246.74] of the brain sprinkle the bowel in
[1244.58 - 1250.22] smaller deposits some even inside the
[1246.74 - 1252.08] emotional center of the brain
[1250.22 - 1253.94] it might occur to you that it's hard to
[1252.08 - 1256.10] build up significant exposure to toxic
[1253.94 - 1257.48] heavy metals in just a few years of a
[1256.10 - 1260.18] young life
[1257.48 - 1262.70] how did my child get filled up with all
[1260.18 - 1266.18] these toxic heavy metals
[1262.70 - 1269.00] how did it happen however
[1266.18 - 1271.10] Mercury is a neurotoxin that slips under
[1269.00 - 1273.44] doctors noses
[1271.10 - 1275.66] does it ever most doctors are oblivious
[1273.44 - 1278.00] to which Medical Treatments they offer
[1275.66 - 1279.80] that contain mercury and if they are
[1278.00 - 1281.72] aware of it they're either in denial
[1279.80 - 1283.40] afraid to break traditional protocol or
[1281.72 - 1284.84] they believe in the treatment and that
[1283.40 - 1286.40] belief overrides their common sense
[1284.84 - 1289.28] about the nature of the toxic heavy
[1286.40 - 1291.68] metals medical communities are due for a
[1289.28 - 1293.54] massive wake-up call about obvious
[1291.68 - 1295.16] Mercury contamination and so what you'll
[1293.54 - 1296.60] see now is functional medicine doctors
[1295.16 - 1298.34] and different doctors now are testing
[1296.60 - 1301.16] for Metals all the time it's like the
[1298.34 - 1302.84] routine thing going on so a lot of years
[1301.16 - 1304.28] of medical medium work and Publishing
[1302.84 - 1308.02] books and getting it out there but it's
[1304.28 - 1308.02] now about toxic heavy metals
[1308.30 - 1315.02] Mercury is a great instigator of ADHD
[1311.74 - 1317.54] and autism in children in the 21st
[1315.02 - 1319.88] century Mercury is also responsible for
[1317.54 - 1321.56] most seizure disorders so I just want to
[1319.88 - 1323.36] answer that a little bit going into the
[1321.56 - 1327.16] seizure someone was asking about that
[1323.36 - 1327.16] seizure disorders epilepsy
[1327.68 - 1331.88] until Mercury and aluminum are addressed
[1330.14 - 1334.16] the conditions will continue to affect
[1331.88 - 1335.96] millions of new kids each year
[1334.16 - 1338.50] millions of new kids around the globe
[1335.96 - 1338.50] each year
[1338.96 - 1342.86] it's very easy for a baby to take in
[1341.06 - 1344.78] toxic heavy metals from her or his
[1342.86 - 1346.88] mother while in the womb and for a
[1344.78 - 1349.04] father to pass along toxic heavy metals
[1346.88 - 1350.96] at conception
[1349.04 - 1352.88] mm info
[1350.96 - 1355.28] that's because the parents have likely
[1352.88 - 1357.14] accumulated Mercury over decades and so
[1355.28 - 1359.18] did their mothers and fathers before
[1357.14 - 1360.62] them and Mercury tends to stay in the
[1359.18 - 1363.56] family both line generation after
[1360.62 - 1366.20] generation in some cases for centuries
[1363.56 - 1368.00] unless specific steps are taken to
[1366.20 - 1369.08] remove it now that's I hate saying this
[1368.00 - 1370.76] in the moment but that's original
[1369.08 - 1373.40] medical meme info and when you see
[1370.76 - 1376.28] somebody on a post somewhere
[1373.40 - 1378.62] say you know like somebody that's trying
[1376.28 - 1380.72] to amp up a crowd because there's there
[1378.62 - 1382.88] are health coach or
[1380.72 - 1384.92] whoever it is out there or influencer
[1382.88 - 1386.72] and they'll be like Mercury can pass
[1384.92 - 1389.42] from generation to generation but no
[1386.72 - 1392.24] citation of family one medical medium
[1389.42 - 1393.86] genetics are not behind ADHD and autism
[1392.24 - 1395.36] now that's going to probably piss off a
[1393.86 - 1396.74] few people right there me just saying
[1395.36 - 1399.68] that but
[1396.74 - 1401.30] it's so interesting and I talk about the
[1399.68 - 1402.56] rest of this I mean it's so packed
[1401.30 - 1404.24] there's so much information let's keep
[1402.56 - 1406.28] on rolling though there's so much to
[1404.24 - 1408.40] talk about so I want to be helpful you
[1406.28 - 1408.40] guys
[1410.84 - 1414.50] and so happy to be here if you guys have
[1412.82 - 1416.96] a little time I want to just cut into
[1414.50 - 1418.88] some symptoms conditions I was talking
[1416.96 - 1421.88] about neurological conditions which is
[1418.88 - 1424.16] ADHD and autism but multiple sclerosis
[1421.88 - 1427.04] we were talking about too hello what do
[1424.16 - 1430.52] you do again what to do against
[1427.04 - 1432.62] depression luck of discipline
[1430.52 - 1434.18] question mark
[1432.62 - 1436.90] let's head into brain saver a little bit
[1434.18 - 1436.90] for depression
[1438.32 - 1443.86] depression is something that people are
[1441.80 - 1443.86] um
[1444.56 - 1448.46] they feel like they're prisoners of
[1446.26 - 1451.34] depression is
[1448.46 - 1453.62] is not describable
[1451.34 - 1455.06] by anyone who hasn't suffered from it
[1453.62 - 1456.80] truly
[1455.06 - 1459.38] I know that so many people have been
[1456.80 - 1460.58] through so much but in here I have a
[1459.38 - 1464.48] protocol
[1460.58 - 1466.04] for depression I have a chapter
[1464.48 - 1468.32] and here's a protocol in here for
[1466.04 - 1470.06] depression so let's hit that for a
[1468.32 - 1471.86] little bit
[1470.06 - 1473.96] what's incredible is there's a
[1471.86 - 1476.42] depression chapter in
[1473.96 - 1477.50] medical medium too as well so I'm going
[1476.42 - 1479.96] to find
[1477.50 - 1482.36] out where we are here I want to read a
[1479.96 - 1483.86] little bit about this to you how many of
[1482.36 - 1486.38] you guys are suffering from depression
[1483.86 - 1488.42] I'm just curious can you just throw it
[1486.38 - 1492.34] at me a little bit if
[1488.42 - 1492.34] if you feel up to responding
[1493.10 - 1497.68] how many of you guys are dealing with
[1495.08 - 1497.68] depression
[1506.00 - 1511.36] I'm looking seeing if you guys are
[1508.04 - 1511.36] responding about it yet
[1513.80 - 1519.98] so I want to read to you a little bit
[1515.48 - 1519.98] about this disorder so it's page 266.
[1521.72 - 1525.86] I love when someone says oh you don't
[1524.06 - 1528.20] know the topic so you have to read out
[1525.86 - 1530.66] of your own book
[1528.20 - 1533.24] you have to read after the book I mean
[1530.66 - 1535.16] it's that much information when we hear
[1533.24 - 1536.96] someone has depression we often have a
[1535.16 - 1539.06] sense of what that means
[1536.96 - 1540.86] they may feel hopeless they may feel
[1539.06 - 1543.02] like their existence is worthless they
[1540.86 - 1545.60] may they may feel guilty even though

[1620.18 - 1623.72] you guys have depression because you're
[1621.32 - 1626.42] sick too you're sick for so long you've
[1623.72 - 1628.58] been sick for a long time and you feel
[1626.42 - 1631.64] actual like
[1628.58 - 1633.56] oppression from that great sadness and
[1631.64 - 1635.78] then a lot of you guys just feel
[1633.56 - 1637.96] depression regardless you know what that
[1635.78 - 1637.96] is
[1638.18 - 1641.78] along with these experiences of
[1639.92 - 1643.88] depression there can be an inability to
[1641.78 - 1646.82] receive any relief
[1643.88 - 1648.38] heard that for so many people there's no
[1646.82 - 1651.20] relief
[1648.38 - 1654.20] depression compounds a depression
[1651.20 - 1656.48] compounds upon itself
[1654.20 - 1658.70] because part of a person's Consciousness
[1656.48 - 1659.60] knows they tried so many Avenues to get
[1658.70 - 1662.00] relief
[1659.60 - 1663.68] it's like a failure feeling like you
[1662.00 - 1664.94] you're trying to get relief for your
[1663.68 - 1666.32] depression you're trying to fix it
[1664.94 - 1669.34] you're trying to get past it and then
[1666.32 - 1673.28] when it fails it's like more depression
[1669.34 - 1675.50] compounds upon that depression right it
[1673.28 - 1677.24] stacks on top of itself
[1675.50 - 1680.02] I know so many of you people have

[1863.00 - 1868.04] it's always like that it's the same
[1864.92 - 1870.62] thing with me as well always like that
[1868.04 - 1873.20] Frenchie league on IG says doctors I've
[1870.62 - 1875.78] seen just don't understand because I
[1873.20 - 1878.36] look fine on the outside so I can't be
[1875.78 - 1881.24] suffering on the inside and they may not
[1878.36 - 1884.00] find anything on the inside either
[1881.24 - 1886.58] so you're suffering on the inside in so
[1884.00 - 1888.62] many different ways and they can't find
[1886.58 - 1890.78] an answer
[1888.62 - 1892.52] the Epstein-Barr virus has created a

[1897.44 - 1900.98] mutations of Epstein-Barr virus and what
[1899.54 - 1902.06] does it create since we're talking about
[1900.98 - 1905.68] fatigue
[1902.06 - 1905.68] chronic fatigue syndrome

[1995.06 - 1999.32] a person in your late teens or early 20s
[1997.40 - 2001.60] can be particularly devastating as you

[2001.60 - 2005.74] and jobs meanwhile feeling stuck and

[2018.64 - 2023.80] so as you're walking you feel like
[2020.92 - 2026.02] gravity is holding you back because your

[2092.92 - 2097.42] young I'm 24 and slowly seeing results
[2095.26 - 2100.60] after being on medical medium six months
[2097.42 - 2104.74] so far to heal Tourette's
[2100.60 - 2107.44] it's freeing to know it's not genetics
[2104.74 - 2109.18] and uncurable like doctors told me my
[2107.44 - 2114.22] whole childhood Tourette's is curable
[2109.18 - 2116.92] Tourette's is healable Tourette's can
[2114.22 - 2119.02] be reversed
[2116.92 - 2121.54] I've had a doctor recently say that to
[2119.02 - 2126.10] me a doctor said to me
[2121.54 - 2128.52] aw Tourette's is fixable it's curable
[2126.10 - 2133.24] that's what the doctor said to me
[2128.52 - 2135.16] recently because he applied it to a
[2133.24 - 2137.38] family member the information for
[2135.16 - 2139.06] medical medium and the Tourette's turned
[2137.38 - 2141.90] around Tourette's is in the brand saver
[2139.06 - 2141.90] book by the way
[2142.18 - 2147.28] brand saver protocols it's in there
[2145.12 - 2149.02] the protocol and
[2147.28 - 2150.82] tourettes is in here
[2149.02 - 2153.04] for learning about it
[2150.82 - 2154.90] narcolepsy is also in the brain sleeper
[2153.04 - 2157.08] books Let's kind of crack into that for
[2154.90 - 2157.08] a second
[2158.80 - 2162.04] I know I'm bouncing around I was just in
[2160.60 - 2163.66] chronic fatigue syndrome but I can't
[2162.04 - 2165.82] help it I want to answer questions
[2163.66 - 2167.62] there's so much information here I'm
[2165.82 - 2169.66] trying to Pace myself right now you guys
[2167.62 - 2171.94] because this is
[2169.66 - 2173.68] a special day to go through this and
[2171.94 - 2177.36] take some time thank you for having
[2173.68 - 2177.36] patience and being here
[2177.70 - 2182.08] so I want to find symptoms and
[2179.38 - 2184.78] conditions really quick
[2182.08 - 2188.04] which
[2184.78 - 2188.04] I mean seriously
[2191.74 - 2195.00] these books are so big
[2202.78 - 2210.06] a b c d e f g h i j k l
[2207.52 - 2210.06] okay
[2212.80 - 2219.76] I think I see you comment there Jen says
[2216.34 - 2221.80] no wait the call says the comment went
[2219.76 - 2223.96] down we healed by Addison's the other
[2221.80 - 2226.36] years ago medical meme information gave
[2223.96 - 2229.36] me my life back and got me off steroids
[2226.36 - 2232.54] unfortunately had a medical injury and
[2229.36 - 2235.18] sick again but this too will heal
[2232.54 - 2237.64] it will
[2235.18 - 2239.44] here's Tourette's right here
[2237.64 - 2241.54] guys don't mind if I count the alphabet
[2239.44 - 2243.52] letters go through them
[2241.54 - 2246.34] told you the information came from above
[2243.52 - 2248.74] I am not a smart guy but the books
[2246.34 - 2250.84] supersede Medical Science in so many
[2248.74 - 2253.24] ways it's unbelievable the information
[2250.84 - 2255.36] comes from above Tourette's syndrome is
[2253.24 - 2258.28] caused primarily by Mercury and copper
[2255.36 - 2261.30] Mercury and copper when you learn how to
[2258.28 - 2264.54] get that out of your brain Tourette's
[2261.30 - 2264.54] goes away
[2264.76 - 2269.32] Tourette's syndrome is caused primarily
[2266.68 - 2272.68] by Mercury and copper with traces of
[2269.32 - 2274.96] lead impeding electrical impulses
[2272.68 - 2277.48] in the brain here's how it happens when
[2274.96 - 2280.12] an electrical impulse travels across the
[2277.48 - 2282.16] synapses it's something like traveling
[2280.12 - 2284.56] through a tunnel if it's a depositive
[2282.16 - 2287.08] toxic heavy metal surrounds that tunnel
[2284.56 - 2289.60] inside the brain the toxic heavy metals
[2287.08 - 2291.70] narrow the channel creating a bottleneck
[2289.60 - 2294.16] the electrical impulse traveling through
[2291.70 - 2296.44] gets hung up practically stuck in a
[2294.16 - 2298.12] short amount of time a fraction of a
[2296.44 - 2300.16] second another electrical impulse
[2298.12 - 2302.86] follows behind it this new electrical
[2300.16 - 2305.26] limb pulse hits the impeded electrical
[2302.86 - 2307.54] impulse and propels the impeded
[2305.26 - 2309.76] electrical impulse forward this is like
[2307.54 - 2311.80] unlike OCD where an electrical impulse
[2309.76 - 2313.90] hits a heavy metal deposit and gets
[2311.80 - 2315.52] propelled backwards in Tourette's the
[2313.90 - 2317.38] copper mixed with lead that's
[2315.52 - 2319.90] surrounding the synapsis conducts the
[2317.38 - 2321.58] electrical impulses forward even as the
[2319.90 - 2324.34] bottlenecking blocks the impulses
[2321.58 - 2325.78] physically to some degree sometimes both
[2324.34 - 2327.40] electrical impulses are even stuck
[2325.78 - 2330.94] together combined and they shoot out
[2327.40 - 2334.56] together and that's what Tourette's is
[2330.94 - 2334.56] it's an electrical impulse
[2335.44 - 2341.44] filled with information a thought and a
[2339.40 - 2343.30] word you guys just got in there talking
[2341.44 - 2345.46] about Tourette's so Tourette's is an
[2343.30 - 2347.76] electrical impulse filled with
[2345.46 - 2347.76] information
[2348.16 - 2352.24] in that electricity in the electrical
[2350.08 - 2354.40] impulse and thoughts
[2352.24 - 2356.92] and emotions
[2354.40 - 2360.40] and when it gets hung up
[2356.92 - 2363.34] in that tube synapsis it shoots forward
[2360.40 - 2364.36] out from being bottlenecked and when it
[2363.34 - 2366.34] does
[2364.36 - 2368.44] Tourette's occurs now there's different
[2366.34 - 2370.96] varieties of threats
[2368.44 - 2374.52] and in different ways depending on where
[2370.96 - 2374.52] the metals are situated in the brand
[2374.86 - 2378.52] so we're talking about Tourette's
[2376.54 - 2381.16] there's so much information in here you
[2378.52 - 2382.54] guys we could spend days upon days weeks
[2381.16 - 2384.46] upon weeks and it's still weeks still
[2382.54 - 2387.40] couldn't cover it all there's protocols
[2384.46 - 2391.00] in brain saver that you can customize
[2387.40 - 2393.28] for everything customized for Tourette's
[2391.00 - 2396.10] customized I'm looking on here
[2393.28 - 2399.52] in here tremors
[2396.10 - 2401.94] vertigo trigeminal neuralgia it just is
[2399.52 - 2401.94] endless
[2403.24 - 2407.50] okay
[2404.56 - 2410.26] ticks and spasms
[2407.50 - 2412.90] tinnitus
[2410.26 - 2414.52] and it goes on seizures let's talk about
[2412.90 - 2416.14] seizures for a minute because I know a
[2414.52 - 2418.96] lot of people know people with seizures
[2416.14 - 2422.34] a lot of people suffer greatly with that
[2418.96 - 2422.34] one so if you guys got a minute
[2423.10 - 2428.14] internet nonsense of severe seizures
[2425.62 - 2430.90] come from large deposits of heavy metals
[2428.14 - 2433.48] rather than sprinklings
[2430.90 - 2435.52] so
[2433.48 - 2438.82] everybody has a sprinkling of toxic
[2435.52 - 2440.26] heavy metals inside their brain
[2438.82 - 2442.60] everybody
[2440.26 - 2443.98] has a sprinkling of toxic heavy metals
[2442.60 - 2446.94] inside their brain looks like Christmas
[2443.98 - 2446.94] tree lights
[2451.36 - 2456.40] okay sometimes there are even clusters
[2453.64 - 2458.20] of large deposits although it's usually
[2456.40 - 2459.88] only a cluster of two deposits when it
[2458.20 - 2462.22] comes down to seizures
[2459.88 - 2464.14] what creates these seizures is the
[2462.22 - 2467.14] interaction of metal specifically in
[2464.14 - 2469.72] alloy of mercury aluminum and copper
[2467.14 - 2471.94] with all three of those residing next to
[2469.72 - 2474.04] each other or sometimes even partially
[2471.94 - 2475.90] forged together through excessive heat
[2474.04 - 2477.76] exchange from past seizures most people
[2475.90 - 2479.74] who suffer from seizures
[2477.76 - 2483.22] severe seizures were exposed to all
[2479.74 - 2486.16] three Metals at the same time
[2483.22 - 2488.14] so I talk about with people that suffer
[2486.16 - 2490.42] from seizures they talk about all the
[2488.14 - 2491.86] details and it's really a huge piece of
[2490.42 - 2494.56] information in here
[2491.86 - 2496.12] but there's a protocol for seizures in
[2494.56 - 2498.16] these books there's the brand saver
[2496.12 - 2501.10] protocols
[2498.16 - 2503.50] if I was having seizures
[2501.10 - 2505.00] I would dive into these books
[2503.50 - 2507.10] and I would start going through the
[2505.00 - 2509.50] protocols
[2507.10 - 2512.32] I would get the metals out of my system
[2509.50 - 2515.38] out of my brain
[2512.32 - 2517.72] and minimize those seizures over time
[2515.38 - 2521.44] it can be done because it has been done
[2517.72 - 2523.12] so many times for people
[2521.44 - 2525.64] but take the books to your doctor ask
[2523.12 - 2527.74] your doctor if it's okay and if if it's
[2525.64 - 2530.08] right for you and then your doctor tells
[2527.74 - 2532.72] you brain saver books
[2530.08 - 2534.40] have seizures in here you can find them
[2532.72 - 2536.38] in the brain saver books seizure and
[2534.40 - 2538.30] protocol seizure and
[2536.38 - 2541.30] here
[2538.30 - 2543.76] information and material
[2541.30 - 2547.14] epilepsy
[2543.76 - 2547.14] Okay so
[2549.40 - 2557.38] any of you guys ever had tinnitus
[2552.72 - 2559.30] popping in the year raining in the year
[2557.38 - 2561.34] I'm just curious on that right there
[2559.30 - 2562.84] because there's so many people there
[2561.34 - 2564.10] because a lot of people so I want to go
[2562.84 - 2566.44] into this people who have chronic
[2564.10 - 2570.40] fatigue syndrome
[2566.44 - 2573.34] most people with CFS or fatigue issues
[2570.40 - 2575.80] don't just have fatigue only
[2573.34 - 2578.26] they have a little bit of dizziness see
[2575.80 - 2581.56] that they have some tinnitus we have
[2578.26 - 2584.20] some ringing and popping in the ear
[2581.56 - 2585.88] they have aches and pains a lot of
[2584.20 - 2588.16] people with fatigue chronic fatigue
[2585.88 - 2591.58] syndrome will also have some fibro
[2588.16 - 2595.50] and some tinnitus and some vertigo
[2591.58 - 2595.50] when you look inside these books
[2595.96 - 2600.34] if you guys don't have the medical meme
[2597.52 - 2601.48] New Edition please consider it if you
[2600.34 - 2603.58] guys don't have the brain saver
[2601.48 - 2605.32] protocols book or the brain zero please
[2603.58 - 2607.60] consider it
[2605.32 - 2609.46] get the information become an expert
[2607.60 - 2611.08] learn it
[2609.46 - 2614.56] get yourself better
[2611.08 - 2618.52] get yourself out of the woods
[2614.56 - 2620.38] pull yourself out of the woods
[2618.52 - 2622.90] with the information
[2620.38 - 2625.06] change your life
[2622.90 - 2627.34] change your life
[2625.06 - 2628.54] baby Paris says you're over there on
[2627.34 - 2630.10] YouTube
[2628.54 - 2633.46] I say you left the YouTube comment the
[2630.10 - 2635.86] other day day four of 369 advanced
[2633.46 - 2638.08] doing this for my allergies they were
[2635.86 - 2641.44] horrible this year proud of you Bibi
[2638.08 - 2641.44] Paris amazing
[2644.14 - 2650.98] and IG do you explain memory and inflect
[2648.04 - 2654.40] loss at early age of 45
[2650.98 - 2656.56] oh my god do I ever
[2654.40 - 2659.08] do I ever how about memory loss
[2656.56 - 2661.30] protocols how about protocols for memory
[2659.08 - 2662.62] loss
[2661.30 - 2664.42] seriously
[2662.62 - 2665.92] they're here
[2664.42 - 2670.02] they're here
[2665.92 - 2670.02] incredible protocols for memory loss
[2670.56 - 2676.00] Alzheimer's memory issues dementia
[2673.78 - 2677.98] there's a dementia Alzheimer's chapter
[2676.00 - 2680.80] but just because you have memory loss
[2677.98 - 2682.36] don't don't go to that place
[2680.80 - 2686.02] then that doesn't mean you have anything
[2682.36 - 2687.64] like that it's easy to have trauma and
[2686.02 - 2689.32] have memory loss
[2687.64 - 2691.30] it's easy to have trauma in your life
[2689.32 - 2692.74] and have memory loss it's easy to have
[2691.30 - 2695.26] too many toxic heavy metals in your
[2692.74 - 2698.82] brain and have memory loss
[2695.26 - 2698.82] it's easy for that to happen
[2703.78 - 2706.50] so
[2707.08 - 2712.38] so much information in here I just
[2709.00 - 2712.38] opened it up to microdosing
[2713.38 - 2718.48] Erica asks any other languages on this
[2715.72 - 2720.04] books these books yes
[2718.48 - 2721.60] um almost in every single country in the
[2720.04 - 2723.04] world
[2721.60 - 2723.64] um could be in every country in the
[2723.04 - 2726.58] world
[2723.64 - 2729.16] you can find them publish
[2726.58 - 2731.74] out there
[2729.16 - 2733.90] but look go to medicalmedium.com take a
[2731.74 - 2736.12] look at the international editions at
[2733.90 - 2739.12] medicalmedium.com go to
[2736.12 - 2739.12] medicalmedium.com
[2740.74 - 2744.60] so I'm just going through
[2742.60 - 2744.60] um
[2745.66 - 2752.62] hey misguided hangover cures
[2749.26 - 2755.32] there's so much information in here
[2752.62 - 2757.36] medical medium website for so much free
[2755.32 - 2759.96] information it's free everywhere on
[2757.36 - 2763.06] medical medium website keep that in mind
[2759.96 - 2765.40] it's very free it's all free over there
[2763.06 - 2767.08] so let's head into memory a little bit I
[2765.40 - 2770.40] want to go into there how many of you
[2767.08 - 2770.40] guys are dealing with memory issues
[2770.86 - 2774.00] I would love to know
[2776.50 - 2784.66] my mind is free on IG doctors told me I
[2781.12 - 2786.58] have a special type of rheumatism that
[2784.66 - 2788.98] attacks my Muslims
[2786.58 - 2793.84] they want me to get they want me to give
[2788.98 - 2795.70] one year therapy with cortisone okay uh
[2793.84 - 2797.62] after I start drink lemon water and
[2795.70 - 2799.42] celery I got healed
[2797.62 - 2801.28] okay
[2799.42 - 2804.12] so the doctors told you to do one year
[2801.28 - 2804.12] on cortisone
[2804.64 - 2809.20] you did lemon water and celery
[2807.82 - 2811.42] and it's gone
[2809.20 - 2814.26] and you're healed
[2811.42 - 2814.26] that's incredible
[2814.80 - 2818.98] he's in front
[2817.18 - 2821.20] and I'm privately
[2818.98 - 2823.18] stay on the sellers you stay on the
[2821.20 - 2826.20] lemon water
[2823.18 - 2826.20] please stay on there
[2828.76 - 2833.80] um Terry Appleman says no info is
[2831.16 - 2836.38] detailed
[2833.80 - 2838.24] and then it just no like medical medium
[2836.38 - 2840.88] info no no info is detailed like medical
[2838.24 - 2842.38] medium info comments Bounce Around
[2840.88 - 2844.00] [Music]
[2842.38 - 2845.86] all right
[2844.00 - 2847.18] you guys seriously so much information
[2845.86 - 2851.02] in here
[2847.18 - 2853.60] I don't even know I'm speechless
[2851.02 - 2855.64] Elizabeth says house some children
[2853.60 - 2859.12] inherent symptoms like one mother and
[2855.64 - 2860.68] other like Father symptoms yes passed
[2859.12 - 2865.84] down for Generation after generation
[2860.68 - 2870.16] through toxic heavy metals DDT radiation
[2865.84 - 2874.78] other poisons and toxins and viruses FC
[2870.16 - 2877.00] bar shingles hhb six hhv7 herpes simplex
[2874.78 - 2879.16] 1 Herpes Simplex 2 whatever they just
[2877.00 - 2882.16] they get passed down
[2879.16 - 2884.20] so metals and viruses and pathogens get
[2882.16 - 2887.14] passed down it's nobody's fault
[2884.20 - 2889.66] it's nobody's fault
[2887.14 - 2891.70] but wait a minute
[2889.66 - 2894.58] sometimes it's not just that sometimes
[2891.70 - 2896.62] it's exposure exposure unexpected
[2894.58 - 2898.78] exposure and I thought that I talked
[2896.62 - 2902.68] about that I just read that earlier
[2898.78 - 2902.68] what that means Beatrice
[2904.18 - 2909.46] where did you go Beatrice Beatrice my
[2906.88 - 2913.54] heart starts racing just as I'm about to
[2909.46 - 2916.54] fall asleep what is it due to
[2913.54 - 2918.82] also has unpleasant extra strong
[2916.54 - 2920.26] Heartbeats
[2918.82 - 2921.34] so
[2920.26 - 2923.38] look
[2921.34 - 2926.26] if your heart's racing that falls under
[2923.38 - 2928.90] like ectopic heartbeat it falls under
[2926.26 - 2931.48] it's not that but it falls under the
[2928.90 - 2934.12] hole right you've got something going on
[2931.48 - 2936.10] with the heart heart racing but you've
[2934.12 - 2937.96] gone to your doctors your doctors didn't
[2936.10 - 2939.70] diagnose you with afib your doctors
[2937.96 - 2941.56] didn't diagnose you with ectopical
[2939.70 - 2943.06] heartbeat or doctors didn't diagnose you
[2941.56 - 2944.86] with something
[2943.06 - 2946.78] so that's another thing all on its own
[2944.86 - 2949.06] did you get a diagnosis from the doctor
[2946.78 - 2950.26] you know telling you what it is it's one
[2949.06 - 2952.84] thing to know
[2950.26 - 2954.42] another thing is a lot of people have
[2952.84 - 2955.96] racing
[2954.42 - 2959.14] Heartbeats
[2955.96 - 2961.84] racing pulse racing heart
[2959.14 - 2965.14] I mean there's so many things people are
[2961.84 - 2967.90] dealing with one is just falling asleep
[2965.14 - 2971.08] is because you're calming yourself down
[2967.90 - 2973.90] enough to feel the fact that that's
[2971.08 - 2976.42] fluctuating I've had a lot of people go
[2973.90 - 2978.16] through that in life where it's that
[2976.42 - 2978.94] moment when you're laying down to go to
[2978.16 - 2981.40] bed
[2978.94 - 2983.08] right there another thing too A lot of
[2981.40 - 2985.42] people have anxiety before they go to
[2983.08 - 2987.58] sleep and it cranks up there's so many
[2985.42 - 2989.14] reasons why people deal with that I'm
[2987.58 - 2991.14] giving you a whole bunch of them because
[2989.14 - 2994.12] I want everybody to have an option
[2991.14 - 2995.92] something there's hundreds of people out
[2994.12 - 2998.26] there right now watching this so I want
[2995.92 - 3000.30] to make sure they can kind of find their
[2998.26 - 3003.12] way with this a lot of you guys might
[3000.30 - 3004.62] have a racing heart at different times a
[3003.12 - 3008.04] lot of you guys might have tachycardia
[3004.62 - 3009.66] aphid you might have heart palps
[3008.04 - 3011.10] um
[3009.66 - 3013.56] um all the different issues with with
[3011.10 - 3015.00] their heart racing the heartbeat
[3013.56 - 3017.76] and
[3015.00 - 3021.60] so I talk about it in these books a lot
[3017.76 - 3023.82] of people have electricity heart racing
[3021.60 - 3026.64] it's electricity it's coming from the
[3023.82 - 3027.72] brain stem coming from the brain down to
[3026.64 - 3030.12] the heart
[3027.72 - 3032.10] and racing the heart and it's not a
[3030.12 - 3034.26] physical heart problem
[3032.10 - 3036.18] a lot of people just have so much junk
[3034.26 - 3038.28] in the liver that's another reason too
[3036.18 - 3040.56] they get a stickiness inside the valves
[3038.28 - 3043.26] I've talked about that for years
[3040.56 - 3045.66] Palace he says my nephew is throwing up
[3043.26 - 3049.98] 10 times a day
[3045.66 - 3052.14] no doctors can figure it out please help
[3049.98 - 3054.66] that's awful
[3052.14 - 3056.52] it really is what I recommend is take
[3054.66 - 3057.72] the doctors take the books to your
[3056.52 - 3059.34] doctors
[3057.72 - 3062.70] had it backwards
[3059.34 - 3063.60] take the books to your doctors
[3062.70 - 3066.72] um
[3063.60 - 3068.70] ask your doctors if it's okay

[3068.70 - 3071.36] the books
[3072.12 - 3077.16] customize a protocol
[3074.40 - 3080.28] start with the basics take it to the

[3087.90 - 3094.14] times a day I would be going into
[3090.24 - 3096.36] mystery vomiting mystery nausea
[3094.14 - 3098.82] so that's what I would do so let's see
[3096.36 - 3100.74] if we can find something these books are
[3098.82 - 3103.86] jam-packed
[3100.74 - 3107.16] give me a minute if we can
[3103.86 - 3109.28] I'm going to start with this one

[3110.88 - 3115.88] let's try to get there
[3117.00 - 3122.06] mystery nausea is something so many
[3119.10 - 3122.06] people suffer from
[3127.62 - 3130.34] all right
[3137.76 - 3143.10] it takes a minute you guys look for this
[3140.34 - 3145.14] just bear with me these are massive
[3143.10 - 3147.60] textbooks
[3145.14 - 3149.64] I am not a professor
[3147.60 - 3150.90] and I'm not the professor in Gilligan's
[3149.64 - 3154.62] Island right
[3150.90 - 3156.54] so I am not a professor at a elite and
[3154.62 - 3158.10] an elite University
[3156.54 - 3161.24] looking at this massive medical
[3158.10 - 3161.24] textbooks right here
[3161.70 - 3166.52] so I'm looking for nausea here it is
[3163.62 - 3166.52] Mystery nausea
[3166.80 - 3171.80] okay
[3168.84 - 3171.80] Godspeed

[3194.52 - 3199.56] there it is I will because it took so
[3197.10 - 3201.78] long to get here I will read and I will
[3199.56 - 3204.68] be at your disposal and I will read a
[3201.78 - 3204.68] metric disposal
[3205.56 - 3210.24] you can throw me out if you need to just
[3207.78 - 3212.46] throw me out mystery nausea and vomiting
[3210.24 - 3214.74] when someone is experiencing nausea or
[3212.46 - 3216.96] vomiting the first thing almost everyone
[3214.74 - 3219.44] assumes is that it's a stomach related
[3216.96 - 3219.44] issue
[3219.60 - 3224.52] someone who visits a doctor complaining
[3221.82 - 3226.68] of nausea will grip your stomach like
[3224.52 - 3229.32] your nephew did I'm sure your nephew did
[3226.68 - 3230.28] that will grip their stomach because
[3229.32 - 3232.94] that's where they're feeling
[3230.28 - 3232.94] uncomfortable
[3233.22 - 3237.54] it's true that these symptoms can
[3235.26 - 3239.82] originate from the stomach in intestinal
[3237.54 - 3242.30] area when food poisoning our stomach flu
[3239.82 - 3245.46] are behind the symptoms in some cases
[3242.30 - 3247.56] stomach cancer can also cause nausea and
[3245.46 - 3249.90] vomiting although in many cases they're
[3247.56 - 3253.08] not symptoms of the disease most cases
[3249.90 - 3253.86] of unexplained nausea now get this
[3253.08 - 3256.26] foreign
[3253.86 - 3258.24] most cases of unexplained Aussie and
[3256.26 - 3261.00] vomiting have everything to do with the
[3258.24 - 3263.94] central nervous system and nearby nerves
[3261.00 - 3266.22] central nervous system and nearby nerves
[3263.94 - 3268.28] keep that in mind here all right when
[3266.22 - 3271.32] you're dealing with mystery nausea
[3268.28 - 3272.94] sensual nervous system
[3271.32 - 3276.00] come on big guy
[3272.94 - 3279.90] let's get over here somewhere let's see
[3276.00 - 3283.70] if we can get you over here uh
[3279.90 - 3283.70] let's let's try this here
[3285.36 - 3288.72] central nervous system
[3287.10 - 3291.18] so
[3288.72 - 3293.88] if I had a nephew
[3291.18 - 3296.04] that was vomiting 10 times a day
[3293.88 - 3298.34] doctors didn't know what it was they
[3296.04 - 3302.88] probably looked at tummy
[3298.34 - 3306.00] colonoscopy endoscopy all of it right
[3302.88 - 3307.74] I would be looking here
[3306.00 - 3310.20] in the brain
[3307.74 - 3313.82] central nervous system
[3310.20 - 3313.82] right but wait
[3315.96 - 3322.64] the vagus nerves which originate in the
[3319.98 - 3322.64] brain stem
[3324.66 - 3328.92] okay
[3325.76 - 3331.50] multitasking here just bear with me
[3328.92 - 3333.54] the vagus nerves which originate in the
[3331.50 - 3334.86] brain stem are the most important nerves
[3333.54 - 3337.92] regarding anything to do with the
[3334.86 - 3341.04] stomach if the vagus nerves are inflamed
[3337.92 - 3343.38] or irritated on any level whether up in
[3341.04 - 3345.42] or near the brain itself or down closer
[3343.38 - 3347.10] to the stomach the vagus nerves
[3345.42 - 3349.02] affecting the stomach
[3347.10 - 3352.82] do you see where I'm going
[3349.02 - 3352.82] the vagus nerve affecting the stomach
[3353.10 - 3361.44] the vagus nerves can go into spasm
[3358.16 - 3363.72] nausea can occur
[3361.44 - 3366.00] often the reason for vagus nerve
[3363.72 - 3369.42] inflammation is a chronic low-grade
[3366.00 - 3372.26] viral infection that's releasing
[3369.42 - 3372.26] neurotoxins
[3372.30 - 3376.08] take the book to your doctor ask your
[3374.40 - 3377.40] doctor if it's a low-grade viral
[3376.08 - 3380.10] infection
[3377.40 - 3382.80] affecting the vagus nerve through
[3380.10 - 3384.84] neurotoxin inflammation and what's
[3382.80 - 3387.90] Happening Here is
[3384.84 - 3391.04] in a nutshell the vagus nerve is
[3387.90 - 3395.10] inflamed and aggravated and agitated
[3391.04 - 3399.54] causing a heaving spasm to happen which
[3395.10 - 3403.76] means vomiting with no
[3399.54 - 3403.76] reason it's a mystery
[3403.88 - 3409.98] Celeste Waldo says you're so amazing aw

[3437.70 - 3442.74] toxic heavy metals inside the brain
[3440.40 - 3445.98] close to the vagus nerves you guys can
[3442.74 - 3447.66] also cause nausea so toxic heavy metals
[3445.98 - 3449.88] inside the brain
[3447.66 - 3452.40] can cause nausea
[3449.88 - 3455.64] brand new exposure to a heavy metal such
[3452.40 - 3459.24] as mercury can cause nausea and vomiting
[3455.64 - 3462.66] I would say to my nephew did you get any
[3459.24 - 3465.48] new exposure I don't know about
[3462.66 - 3467.40] you didn't tell me were you

[3469.02 - 3473.42] were you doing something that has toxic
[3470.94 - 3476.22] heavy metal exposure
[3473.42 - 3478.46] vaping is definitely an antagonistic
[3476.22 - 3478.46] thing
[3479.82 - 3485.10] no judgment for anybody who Vapes it's
[3483.30 - 3487.14] not uncommon for someone to get all
[3485.10 - 3488.46] their dental amalgam fillings removed
[3487.14 - 3490.68] and be overcome by these symptoms
[3488.46 - 3492.60] afterward D2 Mercury exposure causing
[3490.68 - 3494.28] vomiting all the time

[3523.86 - 3527.94] related to viral infections or toxic
[3525.48 - 3529.62] heavy metals can make their way to the
[3527.94 - 3531.48] phagus nerve
[3529.62 - 3532.98] allowing a baby syrup to be extra
[3531.48 - 3534.60] sensitive
[3532.98 - 3537.44] causing
[3534.60 - 3537.44] some vomiting

[3633.36 - 3637.44] the walls of the sinus cavities for
[3635.28 - 3639.48] years can also cause chronic nausea as a
[3637.44 - 3641.22] result of sinus nerves affecting facial
[3639.48 - 3644.16] nerves and other cranial nerves
[3641.22 - 3646.58] eventually placing pressure on the vagus

[3996.24 - 4002.66] all the directions are in there
[3999.12 - 4004.88] on IG miyamona says hi Anthony could you
[4002.66 - 4006.62] say something about getting acne after
[4004.88 - 4009.16] being two years on medical beating
[4006.62 - 4009.16] protocols
[4009.38 - 4013.36] okay so a couple of things
[4013.52 - 4021.02] you can go and Shop in the grocery store
[4017.42 - 4023.02] grab the handles on the carriage
[4021.02 - 4024.92] it's loaded with streptococcus
[4023.02 - 4027.86] streptococcal whatever however you want
[4024.92 - 4029.42] to say I like saying streptococcus
[4027.86 - 4032.00] and I know a doctor friendly call to
[4029.42 - 4035.66] streptococcus or either or
[4032.00 - 4039.86] it's loaded with strep all on the handle
[4035.66 - 4041.84] of your Carriage load it
[4039.86 - 4043.88] it's not just loaded with strap from
[4041.84 - 4046.22] everybody wiping their ass
[4043.88 - 4049.48] and having it on their hands
[4046.22 - 4049.48] because quite frankly
[4053.30 - 4057.32] I know a lot of people that only use one
[4055.46 - 4059.00] sheet to wipe their ass and I understand
[4057.32 - 4062.86] why
[4059.00 - 4062.86] because toilet paper costs money
[4063.26 - 4073.72] but if I wiped my ass with this sheet
[4067.76 - 4073.72] my hand would definitely be soiled
[4074.66 - 4077.26] so
[4077.36 - 4083.74] everybody out there
[4080.00 - 4083.74] has their feces on their hands
[4083.78 - 4087.32] unless they're washing their hands
[4085.46 - 4089.18] before they go into the grocery store
[4087.32 - 4092.68] and grab the cart
[4089.18 - 4092.68] which I highly doubt
[4094.52 - 4099.02] there's gonna be strep 10 different ways
[4097.70 - 4102.34] till Sunday
[4099.02 - 4102.34] on that card handle
[4102.92 - 4107.60] if you're not doing an alcohol rub on
[4105.20 - 4108.98] that card handle
[4107.60 - 4110.96] whatever
[4108.98 - 4112.66] all you have to do is get that on your
[4110.96 - 4115.28] hands and here's the problem
[4112.66 - 4117.32] antibiotic resistant strips
[4115.28 - 4119.60] strips that can put people in hospitals
[4117.32 - 4122.96] are all over those handles and door
[4119.60 - 4126.74] handles and carriage handles
[4122.96 - 4128.78] it's easy to pick up a new strip on The
[4126.74 - 4131.24] Daily
[4128.78 - 4134.42] you can reverse your conditions heal
[4131.24 - 4136.28] your Epstein-Barr heal things take the
[4134.42 - 4138.08] metals out of your body and guess what
[4136.28 - 4140.84] you can go and pick up a brand new strap
[4138.08 - 4143.32] and get a new batch of acne or a UTI or
[4140.84 - 4143.32] something else
[4143.60 - 4148.70] so the tools in these books are to knock
[4147.20 - 4150.50] down what you're getting
[4148.70 - 4152.18] I know people that have healed with
[4150.50 - 4153.86] medical medium information got into a
[4152.18 - 4155.84] brand new relationship
[4153.86 - 4157.88] with a new partner picked up two or
[4155.84 - 4159.74] three new epstein-bars two brand new
[4157.88 - 4162.32] straps
[4159.74 - 4164.78] a Simplex herpes one and they went back
[4162.32 - 4167.18] to drawing board again
[4164.78 - 4169.10] I'm not saying you can't have intimacy
[4167.18 - 4171.62] or you shouldn't have a relationship
[4169.10 - 4173.00] that's not it at all nothing to do with
[4171.62 - 4175.22] that
[4173.00 - 4178.06] I'm just saying that the protocols are
[4175.22 - 4178.06] here for life
[4178.22 - 4182.66] life
[4179.84 - 4184.70] a lot of people heal from their bugs
[4182.66 - 4187.34] that they already have and then go and
[4184.70 - 4189.50] collect a whole round of another batch
[4187.34 - 4191.72] of bugs
[4189.50 - 4193.52] acne protocol and cleanse the heel or
[4191.72 - 4195.02] live a rescue golden seal is incredible

[4259.64 - 4263.68] incredible all on its own
[4266.30 - 4271.00] anyway so what happens with a lot of
[4268.88 - 4271.00] people
[4271.30 - 4277.40] they'll um they'll also keep in mind
[4274.94 - 4279.56] this this can happen too your immune
[4277.40 - 4280.76] system is battling a lot of different
[4279.56 - 4281.90] things inside your body so you're
[4280.76 - 4283.52] somebody that's got a lot going on
[4281.90 - 4284.84] you've got to strep from acne or you've
[4283.52 - 4287.36] got a strap from strep throat from
[4284.84 - 4288.98] childhood you've got uh you had
[4287.36 - 4290.66] mononucleosis when you were a child you
[4288.98 - 4292.82] have two or three different viruses you
[4290.66 - 4294.50] have metals and you your immune system
[4292.82 - 4296.42] is battling off that and then other
[4294.50 - 4299.00] exposures right the immune system is
[4296.42 - 4300.50] trying to gobble all that up and eat all
[4299.00 - 4303.08] that up right that's what your immune
[4300.50 - 4304.70] system is doing and then you guys
[4303.08 - 4306.32] has your immune system's gobbling
[4304.70 - 4309.32] everything up up and eating everything
[4306.32 - 4310.94] up you're healing
[4309.32 - 4314.24] you're healing
[4310.94 - 4316.40] but when there's a lot to heal
[4314.24 - 4319.04] anything can trigger you and tip you
[4316.40 - 4321.20] back too maybe you had blood work done
[4319.04 - 4323.18] and they took too much blood and you
[4321.20 - 4325.96] didn't read the blood draw chapter right
[4323.18 - 4325.96] here in this book
[4326.30 - 4332.30] the blood draw chapter is critical to
[4329.54 - 4334.04] read it so critical I can't even say it
[4332.30 - 4337.28] so let me let me go in here and it's an
[4334.04 - 4338.96] insane chapter it's just insane
[4337.28 - 4341.66] yeah
[4338.96 - 4343.52] so I got some vials of blood here I just
[4341.66 - 4345.56] happen to keep blood sphere blood in the
[4343.52 - 4347.18] refrigerator
[4345.56 - 4350.78] should I just open the refrigerator I
[4347.18 - 4352.94] happen to keep spare blood
[4350.78 - 4356.30] and I'm gonna bring some vials of blood
[4352.94 - 4358.82] here you think this is a Biohazard
[4356.30 - 4361.94] is this a do you think this these
[4358.82 - 4364.60] bottles of my blood or a blood or a
[4361.94 - 4364.60] Biohazard
[4365.66 - 4370.64] anyway okay so
[4368.30 - 4372.56] what happens is that people
[4370.64 - 4374.12] they're healing they're working on their
[4372.56 - 4375.56] healing they're battling a whole bunch
[4374.12 - 4378.92] of different problems in their health
[4375.56 - 4381.86] they're battling bugs they're battling a
[4378.92 - 4385.22] condition of some kind
[4381.86 - 4387.02] that's caused by pathogens their immune
[4385.22 - 4388.64] system is working really hard and then
[4387.02 - 4391.58] they go to their doctor for routine
[4388.64 - 4393.68] blood work and the doctor's drawing a
[4391.58 - 4395.72] ton of blood out of them
[4393.68 - 4396.92] and so you want to understand this you
[4395.72 - 4399.26] want to know this because I'll tell you
[4396.92 - 4401.48] right now I've seen this bring people to
[4399.26 - 4404.42] their knees and bring them to an early
[4401.48 - 4406.28] grave I'm not against blood testing I
[4404.42 - 4408.32] sound like a broken record I'm not
[4406.28 - 4410.72] against blood testing I'm not against
[4408.32 - 4412.40] blood testing
[4410.72 - 4414.56] but there's things you have to
[4412.40 - 4417.92] understand about getting your blood
[4414.56 - 4419.78] drawn and that alone can knock your
[4417.92 - 4422.24] immune system back so if you still have
[4419.78 - 4424.22] a strep inside you boom now you got acne
[4422.24 - 4425.96] a month after you had your blood work
[4424.22 - 4428.30] two months after you had your blood work
[4425.96 - 4430.40] as your immune system drops
[4428.30 - 4434.84] so it isn't just always catching new
[4430.40 - 4436.82] bugs which it is a lot it's also
[4434.84 - 4439.10] it's also your immune system dropping
[4436.82 - 4441.14] for some other reason you have no idea
[4439.10 - 4443.12] about because you weren't taught
[4441.14 - 4446.30] Laura Christine over there on YouTube
[4443.12 - 4448.64] blood draws messed me up before medical
[4446.30 - 4451.94] medium that podcast episode is gold
