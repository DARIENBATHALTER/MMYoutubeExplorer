00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,720
saver right over here

186
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,880
[Music]

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,259
some of the medical medium protocols and

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,419
I'm in

189
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,560
brain betrayer supplements this is

190
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,479
really important because you guys know

191
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,100
I've been doing a couple of lives just

192
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,199
about this

193
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,699
these supplements fall into four main

194
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,500
categories I have to talk about that

195
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,080
again problematic and damaging

196
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,660
supplements

197
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,460
problematic and damaging supplements

198
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,560
mildly problematic supplements

199
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,660
overrated or overused supplements

200
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,340
quality concerns supplements where it's

201
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,139
especially important to seek out high

202
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,880
quality forms because they're frequently

203
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,039
produced with low quality ingredients or

204
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,199
problematic additives or preservatives

205
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,180
there's four categories

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:44,580
in this list of problematic and damaging

207
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,580
supplements I got alkaline ionizer water

208
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,340
machines apple cider vinegar products

209
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,220
taken internally Bentonite and other

210
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,300

211
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,699
caffeine-based energy supplements taken

212
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,220

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,020
essential oils taken internally so don't

220
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,819
get upset about that for the moment with

221
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,160
essential oil things I know that oh my

222
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,680
God the crap I get for even saying

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,020
essential oil I mean I'm saying take it

224
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,160
internally that's the problem right

225
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,259
there

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,300
fat burners because there's fat burners

hydrochloric acid supplements you know

233
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,640
what I mean HCL supplements L-Carnitine

234
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,640
supplements or L-Arginine supplements

235
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,420
mineral oil mushroom coffee with

caffeine oyster supplements Pearl powder

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,680
sodium bicarbonate you know the whole

238
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,180
sodium bicarbonate thing right where you

239
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,760
take all you mix it all and we'll drink

240
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,820
it all down and take oh man turpentine

241
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,779
oil whey protein powder and zeolites

242
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:12,540
those are the problematic and damaging

243
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,000
supplement list

244
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,680
so I went through a bunch of these the

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,660
other day I didn't go through all of

246
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,940
them but I went through colostrum I did

247
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,800
chlorella the day before I talked about

248
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,000
charcoal I talked about all these I'm

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,860
giving you this before warning here

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,019
alkaline ionized or water machines why

251
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,580
they're bad when you see the book you

252
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,140
can read all about it and you'll be mind

253
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,180
blown because it's protecting you the

254
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,980
information which is incredible

255
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,440
I talked about the zeolites now I want

256
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,880
to say something about the zeolite thing

257
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,860
because recently some stuff popped up

258
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,860
because of this right

259
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,420
so someone will say well it's a zeolite

260
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,500
that you know I've been doing you know

261
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:52,320
I've been doing the heavy metal detox

262
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,880
smoothie and as soon as I brought in a

263
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,040
little zeolite things seemed to move

264
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,660
along it's like well you have to

265
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,399
understand how the heavy metal detox

266
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,160
smoothie works when you're doing the

267
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,440
heavy metal detox smoothie for months

268
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,019
it'll finally get to a point where it

269
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,600
removes just enough metal where now

270
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,580
results are starting to happen

271
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,260
sometimes people get really quick

272
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,360
results from the heavy metal detox

273
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,740
smoothie but when you have metal deep in

274
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,640
the brain

275
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,760
it can take months and months of getting

276
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,980
the metal out from the midline canal

277
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,959
zeolite doesn't cross the blood-brain

278
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,420
barrier zeolite does not enter the

279
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:33,720
bloodstream so zeolite cannot get toxic

280
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,180
heavy metals out of a child's brain it

281
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,000
cannot get toxic heavy metals out of an

282
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,100
adult's brain it's impossible it's like

283
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,500
a clay it sits in the intestinal tract

284
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,360
and it can't get into the bloodstream or

285
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,940
cross the blood-brain barrier you have

286
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,839
to understand clay can't enter your

287
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:54,300
bloodstream or you will die

288
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,740
clay can only stay in the intestinal

289
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,079
tract

290
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,300
and cling to the lining it can't enter

291
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,360
your bloodstream

292
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,579
zeolite cannot enter your bloodstream or

293
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,260
you'll get a stroke and a blood clot and

294
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,880
die

295
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:13,260
see how it works

296
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,420
you can't have zeolite or clay float

297
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,779
around in your bloodstream it will

298
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,899
literally give you an aneurysm embolism

299
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:24,000
a blood clot it'll blow out it'll blow

300
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,800
out a blood vessel you will have a

301
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,800
stroke and die

302
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,360
so what I'm trying to tell you is

303
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,160
zeolite can't get Metals out of your

304
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,680
brain

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,480
the heavy metal detox smoothie in the

306
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,579
medical medium books gets metal out of

307
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
people's brains

308
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,720
and there's a different story it's a

309
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,339
different thing so you can be doing the

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,860
heavy metal detox smoothie for a while

311
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,720
and it's taking you to just about that

312
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,279
threshold of healing and then you try

313
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,260
something else you put some coconut oil

314
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,820
and you're like two weeks later after

315
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,740
doing a little coconut oil you're like

316
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,240
oh it's the coconut oil me no it was the

317
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,760
three months of heavy metal detox

318
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,980
smoothies you did or I tried a little

319
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
zeolite spray

320
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,260
um three months into it and three weeks

321
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,360
later it started to change that's from

322
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,100
three months of the heavy metal detox

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,019
smoothie or six months of the heavy

324
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,360
metal detox smoothie or one month of the

325
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,600
heavy metal detox smoothie

326
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,640
Clays and zeolite cannot enter into the

327
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,560
bloodstream nor can it cross the

328
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,040
blood-brain barrier nor can it enter the

329
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,399
brain critical to know so this is a

330
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,079
really the details are so important in

331
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,180
the books the brain saver books that go

332
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,220
into depth details about the heavy metal

333
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,260
detox movie how it works how the

334
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,079
ingredients work together and so much

335
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,839
information about how Metals work that

336
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
no one has really amazing information

337
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,860
you guys so let's talk about the zeolite

338
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,540
thing one more time because I want to

339
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,000
run I want to run by this because I saw

340
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,519
some comments saying someone say oh yeah

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,079
no uh the Zeal I was doing the heavy

342
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,639
metal detox smoothie for a few months

343
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,320
and then after like a few weeks of

344
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,480
trying a zeolite things started moving

345
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
forward um no that was after three

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
months

347
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,459
things started moving forward take the

348
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,320
heavy metal detox smoothie out of your

349
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:10,079
life completely remove all medical

350
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,880
medium tools remove everything and then

351
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,399
you try the zeolite on its own and see

352
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,440
where you stand and see where it goes

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,639
you'll end up like people did 15 years

354
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,399
ago

355
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,040
where they all tried the zeolites and

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
nobody got better until they've learned

357
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,820
about the medical medium heavy metal

358
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,980
detox smoothie it was the opposite

359
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,079
people were all on their zeolites the

360
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,000
zeolite craze already happened and no

361
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:35,339
one got better from years ago but no one

362
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,500
knows about that because every five

363
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,720
years history just boom repeats itself

364
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,220
you get a whole bunch of new suckers and

365
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,779
then it moves forward and moves forward

366
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,940
like that

367
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:49,260
so in the zeolite talk this is a really

368
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:52,079
important aspect of it because when

369
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,180
you're doing the heavy metal detox movie

370
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,060
then you see the results as you go along

371
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,860
and anything you bring in sure you could

372
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,019
just be like oh I was

373
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,139
I don't know

374
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,060
I was doing a lot of oregano uh for a

375
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,899
week and then two months later I started

376
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,579
getting better it must have been the

377
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,380
regular no it's not the heavy metal it's

378
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,660
not the heavy metal detox movie it was

379
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,240
the oregano no so here's how it works

380
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,459
like in the past 20 years ago 18 years

381
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,540
ago 16 years ago when the zeolite craze

382
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,760
came in

383
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,079
and all the big marketing companies were

384
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,079
trying to push it

385
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,240
and all the lies about how it worked all

386
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,040
came in because it never leaves the

387
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,380
intestinal tract because Eli can't get

388
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
out of your intestinal tract it's a clay

389
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,560
if it goes in your bloodstream if it

390
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
actually really physically went into

391
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
your bloodstream you would die of a

392
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,260
stroke it would get to your brain clog

393
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,420
you up and you would die of a stroke

394
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,279
Ella says Nano side seal Light May well

395
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,260
enter the bloodstream it doesn't well

396
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,180
enter the bloodstream at all and cross

397
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,860
the blood brain barrier first Ella

398
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,480
that's not true they've never seen it

399
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,220
they've never tested for it they don't

400
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
have one document that shows it and they

401
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,380
don't have any signs that shows it

402
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,199
either

403
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:01,079
it doesn't reach the bloodstream that's

404
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,260
what they tell you and but that's not

405
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,899
accurate first of all clay

406
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,839
can't reach the bloodstream

407
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:12,120
clay and zeolite it's all the same it

408
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,519
can't reach the bloodstream it can't

409
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,139
enter into it it stays in your

410
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,420
intestinal tract but that's where you're

411
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,459
fooled and the thing is

412
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,519
It's tricky because they get you on the

413
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,079
MLM maybe not UL but they get you on and

414
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
and I appreciate your comment they get

415
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,120
you on the the the whole thing where

416
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,320
it's the MLM thing out there or they get

417
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,300
you on that whole thing where

418
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,760
everybody's selling it and so

419
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,459
everybody's sparking out the same stuff

420
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,320
but just so you know they've been saying

421
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:44,220
it crosses the blood-brain barrier for

422
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,899
20 years and 20 years ago Ella just for

423
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,420
the record

424
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,760
anybody who's using zeolites never moved

425
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,579
forward it never did anything

426
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,660
it was that it was I had thousands of

427
00:15:53,579 --> 00:16:00,420
people call my office thousands saying

428
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,639
that I've been on zeolite and I had to

429
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,440
get them on the heavy metal detox movie

430
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,180
to change their lives the heavy metal

431
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,820
detox movie that's worldwide famous

432
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,519
right now because it's literally changed

433
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,019
so many people's lives and in the brain

434
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,139
saver books

435
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,339
there's a seven okay the seven levels of

436
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,040
the head seven different heavy metal

437
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,740
detox cleanses by the way but it's got

438
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,040
street cred it saved people's lives for

439
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:28,380
years before I even put it in the books

440
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,600
and I had to do that because zeolite

441
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,820
wasn't working so they've done a flip

442
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,680
now everybody's on the heavy metal detox

443
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,940
movie

444
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,540
and then

445
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,579
the sales reps of zeolite try to get the

446
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,680
medical medium community on the zeolite

447
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,540
because they know it's a Sure Shot

448
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,120
because the the medical medium

449
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,199
communities on the heavy metal detox

450
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,139
smoothie

451
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,519
so when they throw in zeolite it's like

452
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,620
a Sure Shot

453
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,079
because they're already getting better

454
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,579
from the heavy metal detox smoothie

455
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,740
so

456
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:04,020
let's go into this look the claims they

457
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,280
are making about zeolite are not true

458
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,980
out there

459
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,439
and I talk about that in the brain saver

460
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,179
books but it's important to know what I

461
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,819
recommend if you're big on zeolite then

462
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,799
throw away all your medical medium tools

463
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,860
and you rely on your zeolite and see how

464
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,199
far you go like people did in the past

465
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,720
throw away your your celery juice throw

466
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,419
away your leafy greens throw away throw

467
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,640
away all your berries because that guess

468
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,140
what berries were anti-in Health it was

469
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,880
all anti-berries

470
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,020
keto movements all the movements it

471
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,400
wouldn't even allow a piece of fruit

472
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,580
that's all medical medium that brought

473
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,919
in all the fruit in the last 25 years so

474
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,299
take away all the medical medium tools

475
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,980
get rid of all your fruit and your

476
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,799
berries and your Apples because it was

477
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:50,400
illegal to eat a red apple on any diet

478
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,280
program in the last 25 years so get rid

479
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,260
of all the medical medium the kale

480
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,940
which medical mean brought in get rid of

481
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,160
the lemon water and medical medium

482
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,840
brought in get rid of all medical medium

483
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,880
tools

484
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,120
and just focus on your zeolite and see

485
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,100
how far that goes it won't go anywhere

486
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,320
seal lights are not safe now because

487
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,640
they're cross-contaminated so let's talk

488
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,539
about it right now I'm in the brain

489
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,580
saver book okay and someone who has a

490
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,200
problem with their intestinal tract it's

491
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,919
a whole other story but let's just go

492
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,900
into it in recent years

493
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,880
inedible varieties of zeolites have been

494
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,460
Unearthed and manufactured in the same

495
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,140
places as edible zeolites causing

496
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,419
cross-contamination so here's what's

497
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,860
happening now

498
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,160
all the zeolites have

499
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,200
cross-contamination of inedible zeolites

500
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,020
and I have to be the messenger for this

501
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,100
which is really important because when

502
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,640
you're sick

503
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,700
you don't have time and room to play

504
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,559
neither edible nor inedible zeolites

505
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,419
cross the blood-brain barrier if you

506
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,520
hear that you guys neither edible or

507
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:58,380
inedible zeolites cross the blood-brain

508
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,539
barrier

509
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,539
nor do they enter the brain

510
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,720
cross-contaminated zeolites varieties

511
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,760
stay in the intestinal tract and

512
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,600
irritate the lining causing dehydration

513
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:15,600
and vagus nerve sensitivities

514
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,820
there has never been any proof in our

515
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,799
history that has shown a zeolite

516
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,679
crossing the blood-brain barrier nor

517
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,600
entering the bloodstream

518
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,760
that's how demented the whole thing is

519
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,400
too

520
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,460
edible zeolites even if you have every

521
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,539
insurance that they're not

522
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,340
cross-contaminated should not be taken

523
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,500
in high dosages or long term because

524
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,780
even edible zeolite varieties build up

525
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,880
inside the gut creating imbalances in

526
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,500
dehydration so if you're you're somebody

527
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,780
dealing with a neurological problem and

528
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,880
this is what I saw anyone taking too

529
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,679
much zeolite with neurological problems

530
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,320
it would dehydrate them and bring down

531
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,320
their electrolytes robbing electrolytes

532
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,140
large dosages of zeolites can create a

533
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,240
trace mineral imbalance because zeolites

534
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,580
don't have a discernment between what's

535
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,100
toxic heavy metals and what's a precious

536
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,799
Trace mineral so get this one

537
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,620
when you take zeolites

538
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,960
the zeolite doesn't have any discernment

539
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,460
between a heavy metal or your precious

540
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,100
trace minerals

541
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,679
your precious trace minerals

542
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,640
that's a really big important one right

543
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
there all on its own

544
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,419
large dosages of zeolite can create

545
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,100
Trace mineral imbalances because zeoids

546
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,780
don't have this discernment which is

547
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,700
really important zeolites do not travel

548
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,860
into the bloodstream binding onto toxic

549
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,039
heavy metals their zeolites are not a

550
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,179
reliable binder

551
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,640
zeolites only stay in the intestinal

552
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,200
tract just like clay as zeolite sit

553
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,700
inside the intestinal tract they can

554
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,740
interrupt trace minerals from leaving

555
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,080
the intestinal tract and entering the

556
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,960
liver anyway I'm just covering zeolites

557
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,059
a little bit more because it breaks my

558
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,460
heart

559
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:57,960
to see people who are sick and

560
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,120
struggling

561
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,380
get the scale tipped the wrong way all

562
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,419
the time

563
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,820
it's like who has that time and energy

564
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,740
when you're sick and chronically ill the

565
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,260
brain saver books

566
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,120
change all that in the medical medium

567
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:16,260
books have changed all that

568
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,380
the thing is is if nobody ever healed

569
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:22,020
or got improvements or got out of their

570
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,720
wheelchairs for medical medium books and

571
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,000
information if nobody ever heals all

572
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,919
these years

573
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,900
and I and I didn't have all this

574
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:32,159
information from above to put into these

575
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,559
books and put out there no one ever

576
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,980
healed then I I should probably shut up

577
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:40,919
I should just shut up and not and not

578
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:43,320
and just be like okay what zeolites

579
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,000
enter the brain sure let me go get that

580
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,760
see like product

581
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,039
I should just be quiet

582
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,799
but the truth is medical meaning of

583
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,679
information has saved so many people

584
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,919
and has protected so many people

585
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,120
and and so it's all about looking out

586
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,580
for that person so they don't

587
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,140
accidentally do something like this okay

588
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,000
let's talk about diatomaceous earth

589
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,799
particles which I didn't cover

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,500
so I'm going to go into diatomaceous

591
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,740
earth particles in here so I'm in

592
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:16,679
problematic and damaging

593
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,659
supplements so let's go there now

594
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,919
so many people have tried diatomaceous

595
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,960
earth so it's not that I'm just picking

596
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,419
on zeolite let's let's hit diatomaceous

597
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,340
earth for a minute

598
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:28,620
agitates and clings to the intestinal

599
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,080
Linings and does not leave the

600
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,200
intestinal tract quickly so if somebody

601
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,480
eats diatomaceous earth

602
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,919
it clings to the intestinal tract but

603
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,960
doesn't leave

604
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,360
that's a big problem for people that are

605
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,900
struggling abrasive

606
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,320
to sensitive nerves

607
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,600
throughout the stomach so check this out

608
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,179
so there's a question what about fulvic

609
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,039
zeolite I used it with chlorella and my

610
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,679
tests were good

611
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,140
get rid of all medical medium tools

612
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,179
all of them and just go ahead and use

613
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,360
fall vacant zeolite

614
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:09,059
and then after a year or whatever

615
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,100
let me know how your tests are

616
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,740
that you'll be going back on all the

617
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,960
medical medium tools chlorella is a

618
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,640
problem all on its own so let's talk

619
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,559
about Chlorella

620
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,820
and we'll do that after diatomaceous

621
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,440
earth I actually will go straight to

622
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,360
chlorella now

623
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,240
and it's in the book so you can learn

624
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,740
right here it's in the books

625
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,900
leafy greens weren't in the health

626
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,520
movement that's a medical medium tool I

627
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,620
know that irritates some people because

628
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,380
they remember leafy greens in the last

629
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,600
five years or six years or something or

630
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,820
they heard it from somebody else but you

631
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,980
weren't even allowed to eat a leafy

632
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,659
green go back 25 years ago it was

633
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,400
iceberg lettuce in the health movement

634
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:51,960
it was romaine lettuce in the health

635
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:53,940
movement and so basically you know leafy

636
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,860
greens is a tool on its own you get rid

637
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,600
of your leafy greens you get rid of all

638
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,299
the other things in your berries and

639
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
your apples get rid of the lemon lemon

640
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,620
waters this is how it works with all

641
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,260
Trends not enough considerations being

642
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,120
given to who can have fun dabbling with

643
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,179
the trend and who doesn't have room to

644
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,460
play medical medium

645
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:16,140
information there here we go let's talk

646
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,720
about Chlorella

647
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,880
chlorella does not bind on to toxic

648
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,059
heavy metals properly this is important

649
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,740
to know

650
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,900
chlorella spreads toxic heavy metals

651
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,159
into adjacent tissue so if you're using

652
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,240
Chlorella

653
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,559
you're spreading metal potentially into

654
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,980
tissue

655
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,980
that's next to the metal

656
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,140
chlorella doesn't does not have the

657
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,400
ability to remove toxic heavy metals

658
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,559
from the body so when you actually

659
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
consume chlorelli you can't remove a

660
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,059
toxic heavy metal out of the body

661
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,240
it's not going to happen

662
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:56,700
chlorella is not antibacterial and it's

663
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,380
not antiviral either

664
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,320
one of the big reasons why so many

665
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,600
people are sick rather it often contains

666
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,299
bad bacteria resulting in foodborne or

667
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,020
illness so here's here's the story of

668
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,020
Chlorella

669
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,600
probably one of the most negligent

670
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:18,299
supplements that have been in the trendy

671
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,640
world for a long time it's caused

672
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,960
tremendous pain and suffering for a lot

673
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,440
of people

674
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,179
because it often carries a bacteria

675
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,000
within it

676
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:31,740
that bacteria doesn't get

677
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,500
found

678
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,039
and it gets out in the market and people

679
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,880
get very very sick I've seen people

680
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:44,100
vomiting for days and days hospitalized

681
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,520
because of Chlorella I've seen people

682
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,320
suffer great great disadvantages and

683
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,240
their healing process

684
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,320
because of Chlorella

685
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:57,600
I've seen people gut sick on and off for

686
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,820
years because of chlorella because of

687
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,100
the foodborne pathogens

688
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,820
bacteria that's in chlorella over the

689
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,779
years I would not even put that stuff on

690
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,460
my

691
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,700
table top

692
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,559
I just don't trust it to that degree

693
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,880
okay so the so back to that what's wrong

694
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,020
with diatomaceous earth particles

695
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,400
everyone

696
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,779
let's go we're in the brain saver

697
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,039
protocols

698
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,400
you guys are on sale right now

699
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,200
amazon.com I want you to know and these

700
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,480
are two incredible books released at

701
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,520
once getting both of them is critical

702
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,320
not just one of them

703
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,539
they're big textbooks filled with

704
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,700
information they're packed if you just

705
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,860
got on here

706
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,860
and they're 40 off let's talk about

707
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,120
diatomaceous earth particles here

708
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,620
agitates and clings to the intestinal

709
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,299
Linings and does not leave the

710
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,460
intestinal tract quickly if you have

711
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,440
vagus nerve issues

712
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,580
if you have anything going on with

713
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,559
anxiety any kind of things like that

714
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,080
anything happening with your intestinal

715
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,179
tract Crohn's colitis IBS not even that

716
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,980
just digestive trouble

717
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,200
diatomaceous earth particles is the

718
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,720
worst thing you can put in your system

719
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,580
another terrible mistake that's been

720
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,960
thrown on the chronically ill the

721
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,059
chronically ill

722
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,919
they're the guinea pigs

723
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,360
they're the guinea pigs

724
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,480
okay

725
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,340
and they're the ones that have to like

726
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,140
feed the system out there the corrupt

727
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,059
system of supplements and the corrupt

728
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,860
system of whatever out there

729
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,140
Pharmaceuticals whatever they have to

730
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,059
feed the system

731
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,380
the chronicle are always taken advantage

732
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:33,419
of

733
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,419
and the medical medium books you'll find

734
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:38,159
consistency not contradict no

735
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,720
contradictions you won't find

736
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,720
contradictions in the work I've done

737
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,480
going all the way back for decades

738
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,919
and so there's a reason lots of reasons

739
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,659
for that and the problem is like when

740
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,700
you take an example like diatomaceous

741
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:53,340
earth particles I can't tell you how

742
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,039
many people their immune systems tanked

743
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,720
because of Diatomaceous Earth

744
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,720
it drops the immune system

745
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,840
abrasive to sensitive nerves

746
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,640
throughout the stomach duodenum

747
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,799
intestinal tract triggering symptoms of

748
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,900
sensitive vagus nerves people do all

749
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,880
these Health Trends and supplements and

750
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,539
they do okay sometimes if they aren't

751
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,059
really sick if they're not that sick yet

752
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:24,600
but these trendy supplements are doing

753
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,340
their damage and it shows up later no

754
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,320
one understands what's really happening

755
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,320
and they pay the price later

756
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,679
okay so diatomaceous earth particles

757
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,900
cause problems throughout the stomach

758
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,940
duodenum and intestinal tract triggering

759
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,679
symptoms of sensitive vagus nerves so

760
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,020
here you are you're somebody with a

761
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,900
sensitive vagus nerve issue

762
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,120
and you're trying to heal

763
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,860
you got all kinds of ticks and spasms

764
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,120
you got tightness in the chest you got a

765
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,740
little bit of panic every now and then

766
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,900
you got anxiety you're struggling

767
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,539
emotionally you're struggling physically

768
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,580
you have some vertigo you have some

769
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:04,799
dizziness maybe you have something else

770
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,539
going on and you're dealing with a vagus

771
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,980
nerve sensitivity maybe digestive

772
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,039
trouble and problems because of your

773
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,600
vagus nerves and someone says oh here's

774
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,220
an ad right here take a look at this

775
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,580
diatomaceous earth or you should be on

776
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,740
diatomaceous earth and you take it

777
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,360
here's another thing about Diatomaceous

778
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,200
Earth get this one

779
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,960
also be cautious not to inhale

780
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,000
diatomaceous earth not to inhale it

781
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,740
I've seen terrible things happen to

782
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,919
people when they inhale diatomaceous

783
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,919
earth

784
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,740
due to its ability to lower the immune

785
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,860
system

786
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,380
when caught in the lungs

787
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,039
if you breathe in diatomaceous earth

788
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,039
particles

789
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,299
they get caught in the lungs and they

790
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,860
lower the immune system of the person so

791
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,659
that means if you have something like

792
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,299
Epstein-Barr if you have something like

793
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:00,120
streptococcus if you have Simplex herpes

794
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,220
one if you have a cold sores if you have

795
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,980
anything going on in your life

796
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,980
if you have cancer if you're breathing

797
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,320
in diatomaceous earth particles

798
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,240
and they get in your lungs it lowers

799
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,799
your immune system

800
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,500
you guys got to check out the brain

801
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:19,140
saver books they just came out now

802
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,320
they're miracles for the chronically ill

803
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:26,220
because they they protect

804
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,080
I can say this because it's true also be

805
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,539
cautious not to inhale diatomaceous

806
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,380
earth due to its ability to lower the

807
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:37,260
immune system when caught in the lungs

808
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,120
so you guys there's a list of 55 brain

809
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,039
betrayer supplements in these books with

810
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,899
in-depth information on why it's a good

811
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,740
idea to stay away from these supplements

812
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,740
I'm letting you know

813
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,640
and by the way it's an honor to be here

814
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,799
again you guys are going to look forward

815
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,960
to actually connecting with you guys and

816
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,360
showing you the books it's really it's

817
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,500
just been so wonderful

818
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,419
white blood cells whoa gotta hear this

819
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,899
about Diatomaceous Earths I forgot about

820
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:09,179
this I forgot about this

821
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:13,020
this is mind-blowing right here

822
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,399
white blood cells see diatomaceous earth

823
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,539
particles

824
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,640
as foreign Invaders and have to consume

825
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,960
them how do you like that they have to

826
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,419
consume them

827
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,740
I got a white blood cell right here

828
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,100
okay

829
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,760
so let's just pretend this sponge

830
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,460
is a diatomaceous earth particle okay

831
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,279
so you breathe in the diatomaceous earth

832
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,559
particles or you swallow them

833
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,700
and your white blood cells have to come

834
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,520
along

835
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,820
and they have to devour

836
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,220
the diatomaceous earth particle

837
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,399
and that's how it's lowering the immune

838
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,399
system

839
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,880
so when white blood cells see a

840
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,039
diatomaceous earth particle as a foreign

841
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,740
Invader it has to consume them which can

842
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,440
lead to an over burdened lymphatic

843
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,380
immune system so an overburdict

844
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,899
lymphatic immune system you know lymph

845
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,880
nodes so your lymphatic system through

846
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:19,140
your body so that's your white blood

847
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,600
count right there so it's it's devouring

848
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,059
those Earth particles

849
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,679
allowing pathogens such as viruses to

850
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:27,120
take advantage and create a flare-up on

851
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,440
a chronic condition so let's go back to

852
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,120
this a chronic flare-up so say someone

853
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,980
is trying to get into Health they're

854
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,419
getting rid of processed foods they've

855
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,679
found their way a little bit through the

856
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:41,480
health world

857
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,480
maybe they pick up celery juice

858
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,380
medical medium tool or something

859
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,480
but at the same time

860
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,279
they're also doing things like they got

861
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,380
stuff in here like they're like well

862
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,779
let's see I got my diatomaceous earth

863
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,120
particles here I got my zeolites over

864
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:58,559
here I got my full McDonald's what else

865
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,539
do I have and I got a whole bunch of

866
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,760
stuff and here they are they're trying

867
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,159
to move themselves forward

868
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,080
they're trying to get themselves better

869
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,059
and then there's this battle happening

870
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,100
that they don't know this war happening

871
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:13,320
the good things they're doing get

872
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,140
outweighed by the bad there's a constant

873
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,960
tug and pull so if you're not if you're

874
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:21,059
not that sick you won't notice so the

875
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,799
point goes like this if you're not a

876
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:24,120
sick person like really sick and really

877
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,519
chronically sick you're not going to

878
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,279
notice while you do all the bad things

879
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,500
but if you're really sick you'll notice

880
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,720
it or it'll just tank you and you don't

881
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,980
won't know what it was

882
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,980
that's important to know

883
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,659
and here's another thing too It's tricky

884
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,399
because you'll see somebody out there

885
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,940
say oh diatomaceous earth particles

886
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,940
helped me

887
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:53,159
and then it destroys a whole bunch of

888
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,260
lives

889
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,940
like diatomaceous earth particles it

890
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,120
helped me

891
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,120
and then you got 56 people that hear

892
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,679
that they go take it and now they're on

893
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,899
mattress Island and they're stuck on

894
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,359
mattress Island but who cares

895
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,480
who cares right

896
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,060
like who cares that's how it works it

897
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,820
doesn't matter if like 50 people

898
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,500
ended up like taking the wrong zeolite

899
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,300
or too much zeolite or whatever it is or

900
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,800
you got you got 50 people doing

901
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,659
diatomaceous earth particles and

902
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,460
chlorella you got people doing charcoal

903
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,320
who cares if they get too sick and

904
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,020
they're just battling chronic illness

905
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,720
for the next 20 years in their life or

906
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,659
they're injured by it who cares and

907
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:39,419
that's how it works out there

908
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,399
it was my experience my experience was

909
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:44,220
diatomaceous earth made me feel better

910
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:45,839
50 people hear that and they go down in

911
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,960
tank

912
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,960
thank you

913
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,639
all right so you know and that's just

914
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,460
the way it works

915
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,800
and it's sad there's a lot of yeah melt

916
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,080
them you said so many pitfalls out there

917
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,359
so true

918
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,619
so true

919
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,140
so

920
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,760
let's go into

921
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,380
mildly problematic supplements I have so

922
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,359
many in here to talk about

923
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,119
and the thing is you guys

924
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,339
when that person tanks down the road and

925
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,339
they get sick or sicker

926
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:23,339
they took kind of a

927
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:26,940
bunch of people went down there before

928
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:29,160
that it's like it's like this it's

929
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,800
when someone is actually

930
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,960
like saying hey I diatomaceous earth

931
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,000
particles worked with me chlorella

932
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,680
worked with me no one knows about that

933
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,200
person that took the chlorella or their

934
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,359
child to chlorella and now they're so

935
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,060
sick for years because they got the

936
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:47,099
foodborne particles in their Chlorella

937
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,660
or nobody knows about the diatomaceous

938
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,460
earth particles that gave them such a

939
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,720
flare that they were now bedridden for

940
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,359
two years

941
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,000
nobody knows about that person who took

942
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:58,980
the charcoal and their intestinal lining

943
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,780
suffocated and they couldn't get

944
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,520
nutrients and they became so nutrient

945
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,619
deficient that they lost their lives

946
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,540
practically down the road but no one

947
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,300
cares or sees any of that they don't see

948
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,700
that history or anything but that one

949
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,140
sales rep or that one person's like our

950
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,420
charcoal's the greatest take it

951
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,160
internally it gets out metals and all

952
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,660
this crap they say

953
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,060
and

954
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,980
you know oh it does get Metals well

955
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,660
didn't get charcoal wasn't used for

956
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,160
getting Metals out years ago when it

957
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,900
came out on the scene until medical

958
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,160
medium talked about metals and then all

959
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,660
of a sudden the sales reps are like oh

960
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,660
yeah no it takes care of metals too

961
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,660
the scams are just abundant

962
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,280
so I'm in a section here of mildly

963
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,260
problematic supplements if you guys just

964
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,359
got here the brand saver books isn't

965
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,820
just this this is one tiny little micro

966
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,380
section out of the brain saver books I

967
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:55,500
want you to know this is just a tiny bit

968
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,280
okay mildly mildly problematic

969
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,280
supplements

970
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,240
all right

971
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,359
let's go into

972
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,280
herbal combination powders I'd like to

973
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,040
go into that a little bit

974
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,140
so herbal combination powders herbal

975
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
combinations that are low quality often

976
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,339
containing toxic heavy metals and what

977
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,200
people don't realize is powders in the

978
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:22,260
health Movement Like herbal powder

979
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,180
combinations really loaded with Metals

980
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,400
but really off the chart

981
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,740
often containing toxic heavy metals

982
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,740
often these herbal combination powders

983
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,140
contain non-verbal additives such as

984
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,720
Clays and probiotics that can either

985
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,640
irritate the gastrointestinal Linings or

986
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,220
just not be beneficial to the brain and

987
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,599
body so herbal combination powders that

988
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,560
have a little bit of this in it a little

989
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,380
bit of that and a little bit of

990
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,960
Bentonite a little bit of another clay

991
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,420
and a little bit of probiotic

992
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,220
they're really irritants

993
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,220
but they don't offer anything

994
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,220
the herbs that are chosen are not for

995
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,500
specific conditions and symptoms so

996
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,359
remember that every time there's an

997
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,760
herbal powder out there

998
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,680
it's never chosen as a blend for really

999
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,099
any specific symptoms or conditions or

1000
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,599
really why or what it's thrown together

1001
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:15,060
as a business

1002
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,240
a business kind of

1003
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,480
direction or intention always thrown

1004
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,460
together of like what's easiest to find

1005
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,540
the cheapest to find throw it all

1006
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,240
together

1007
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:30,180
and just put it out there

1008
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,160
the herbs chosen are hit and miss so the

1009
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,020
herbs in these herbal powders that

1010
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,760
people actually consume and mix and

1011
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,920
consume out there are all hit and miss

1012
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,740
including in the capsules

1013
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,260
it's not in enough quantity it was

1014
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,820
someone stole this and poached this from

1015
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,579
medical medium recently I couldn't

1016
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,020
believe it like some I guess doctor dude

1017
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,119
or somebody

1018
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,579
um on social media

1019
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,640
the only place you heard this one line

1020
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,880
was from mm info published first talked

1021
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,359
about first and here it is

1022
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,760
the in these supplements they take only

1023
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,800
specs and they put all the specs

1024
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,839
together and then they lump it all into

1025
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,359
one supplement but you have like 20 30

1026
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,300
40 things in there

1027
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:17,040
so even if there is an herb that can be

1028
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:19,200
helpful for a condition so you've read

1029
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,960
your supplement you read your your

1030
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,640
herbal powders combination powders and

1031
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,900
you say oh that herb is said to be

1032
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,119
pretty good

1033
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,220
it's not in enough quantity because it's

1034
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,680
merely a smidgen of the herb mixed with

1035
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,320
a dozen or more other herbs or additives

1036
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,359
that was literally poached from Doctor

1037
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,940
without citing it back to me

1038
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,680
some dude on social media the poaching's

1039
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,619
real it's Non-Stop

1040
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,200
a supplement brand took it

1041
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,380
and it had some health Guru doctor guy

1042
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,839
on a podcast talking about it but they

1043
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,640
took that so it's amazing how supplement

1044
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,560
Brands out there will take medical meme

1045
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,119
information and use it against the

1046
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,440
people when they're the ones doing

1047
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,900
exactly what the medical meme

1048
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,339
information is saying is bad

1049
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,339
and then they put it on an ad

1050
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,339
all right let's find another one too see

1051
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,480
pine needle tea I'm not gonna read that

1052
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,339
one on here

1053
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,099
not going to read about pine needle t on

1054
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:16,079
here cold like spring I hear pieces of

1055
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,440
your info everywhere is it driving you

1056
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,480
crazy yet May right because it's pretty

1057
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,280
much yeah

1058
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,740
I hear pieces of your info everywhere

1059
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,599
now they even say mystery weight gain

1060
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,520
can be connected to the liver they never

1061
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,859
knew the liver had anything to do with

1062
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,320
weight gain published first by medical

1063
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:36,119
medium and now used on ads too by

1064
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,940
doctors and they don't even have a study

1065
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:40,320
to be published around it they only have

1066
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,300
the medical medium books but they

1067
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,520
they're all doing it illegally by the

1068
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:47,820
way mate it's all illegal it's just that

1069
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,040
I have a choice to make do I go after

1070
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,780
everybody out there that's doing the

1071
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,619
most hideous things like that corrupted

1072
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,440
things

1073
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,599
or do which will take all my time or do

1074
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,420
I still do I spend all my time putting

1075
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,460
out answers and free information day in

1076
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,140
and day out I can choose one or the

1077
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,640
other you can't do both so I choose

1078
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,800
making sure I keep on giving you guys

1079
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,660
information whenever you hear stagnant

1080
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,180
sluggish overburdened liver it's medical

1081
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,460
medium terms and now doctors are using

1082
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,460
it it's everywhere stagnant overburdened

1083
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:20,700
whoever knew a stagnant overburden what

1084
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:23,300
liver all mm terms

1085
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,300
yeah

1086
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,400
so

1087
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:32,700
I mean my mildly problematic supplements

1088
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,859
right here here's neem oil neem oil is a

1089
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,960
big one right how many people took neem

1090
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,140
oil how about that one so I got it in

1091
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,140
here

1092
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,460
it's I don't have a lot written on it

1093
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,240
it's just avoid taking neem oil

1094
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,760
internally it's too astringent

1095
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,740
it's too astringent if you're even

1096
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,720
sensitive you're going to be struggling

1097
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,359
from that one

1098
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,339
its chemical compounds are aggressive on

1099
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,359
the stomach and intestinal lining so in

1100
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:02,700
neem oil

1101
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,619
it's a stringent chemical compounds are

1102
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,660
not fit for being internal for the human

1103
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,859
body and a lot of people get in trouble

1104
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,140
because of that when they take their

1105
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,760
neem oil but they don't even know it and

1106
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,619
then they'll blame something else like

1107
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,119
the Apple they ate and someone will say

1108
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,619
well you're not allowed to eat fruit

1109
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,599
you're fruit sensitive meanwhile it's

1110
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,839
the neem oil that's just ruining their

1111
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,839
gut

1112
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,380
because of this neem is also an irritant

1113
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,820
to the vagus nerve so here's what I

1114
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,800
don't like about neem oil and I never

1115
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,859
did you'll hear me never talk about or

1116
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,859
promote neem oil neem oil is a massive

1117
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:36,599
irritant to the vagus nerves

1118
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,880
Vegas nerves were tightness of the

1119
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,220
throat kinds of the chest anxiety Panic

1120
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,460
all these different issues but it's a

1121
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,460
big big irritant to the vagus nerves and

1122
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,099
now you'll see out there because of mm

1123
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,339
info again you'll see a lot of people

1124
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:57,780
they're now Vegas they're experts even

1125
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:00,119
though there's no science behind any of

1126
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,319
it so where do they get their info that

1127
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,099
they're talking about

1128
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,660
um

1129
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:05,520
did they talk to Spirit of compassion

1130
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,619
too because I'm confused about that one

1131
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,680
so all these decades I put vagus nerve

1132
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,440
information out there and the Vegas

1133
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,720
nurse react to real astringent

1134
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,280
properties like the kind that aren't

1135
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,980
like I'm not talking about like food

1136
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,319
like like some blueberries or something

1137
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,319
like that I'm not talking about

1138
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,839
um a grape okay and even grapes grapes

1139
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:30,300
some grapes can be so tart that they're

1140
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,240
too intense right if you eat too many of

1141
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,180
them but the point is is that the vagus

1142
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,520
nerves are hypersensitive to astringent

1143
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,940
astringent properties

1144
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,680
and neem oil lights up the Vegas nerves

1145
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,319
not to heal it it doesn't light up the

1146
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,260
vagus nerves to heal the vagus nerves

1147
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,780
neem oil creates a situation where it

1148
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,119
increases anxiety it increases ticks and

1149
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,560
spasms it increases digestive system

1150
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,359
discomfort and all that and how many of

1151
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,819
you guys have tried the whole neem oil

1152
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,680
cold white spring many are wondering

1153
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:03,720
about CBD oil I talk about it in the

1154
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,020
brain saver book

1155
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,920
I just don't want I just don't want

1156
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,400
um

1157
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:14,760
the pitchforks and the Torches and the

1158
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,319
uh shovels and the bats with nails on

1159
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,599
the end of them I just don't want to get

1160
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,339
too bad of a beating or slashing today

1161
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:23,040
so I'm not going to talk about the CBD

1162
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:24,420
oil but it's in the books it's in the

1163
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,020
book

1164
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,560
so the vagus nerve is definitely

1165
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,599
okay I will say this about CBD oil

1166
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,800
you'll notice something it's not CBD oil

1167
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,900
anymore

1168
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,839
it's CBD oil mixed with all this medical

1169
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,720
medium stuff why is that happening

1170
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,760
uh for years uh you know like

1171
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,520
everybody's had CBD oil to be a miracle

1172
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm not judging anybody

1173
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,060
but then because CBD oil wasn't fixing

1174
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,800
everybody they started putting like the

1175
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,440
lemon balm and all the medical medium

1176
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,240
tools in the CBD oil so now the CBD oils

1177
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,480
have all the medical medium stuff in it

1178
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,060
how weird is that why

1179
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,160
because I haven't been promoting CBD oil

1180
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,500
all these years because when

1181
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,319
I had somebody come to me and they'd be

1182
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,780
like well the CB oil is not working

1183
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,180
uh I would have to say well we got to

1184
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,920
get you on lemon balm a friend or

1185
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,240
whatever or a loved one you have to get

1186
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,060
you out of the lemon bottle oh my God

1187
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,500
the lemon balm's working and so but the

1188
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:28,020
point is is I get it a lot of you guys

1189
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,420
love your CBD oil I'm not harping on

1190
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,220
that I'm just saying that it's changing

1191
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,780
in about a couple of years you're not

1192
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,240
going to be able to get straight CBD oil

1193
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:39,240
it's going to be CBD CBD oil with all

1194
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,160
the medical medium tools mixed in it

1195
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,140
you're not going to have straight CBD

1196
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,359
oil in a few years I'm letting you know

1197
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,920
it's all going to have lemon balm in it

1198
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,420
and all the other stuff that's in the

1199
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,240
brain saver books in the other books

1200
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,220
original medical medium information it's

1201
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,160
really Advanced about the vagus nerves

1202
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,140
too what I'm talking about so just so

1203
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,420
you know in these books

1204
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,880
I go into advanced information about the

1205
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,220
vagus nerves stuff I've never talked

1206
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,579
about before are in here

1207
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,500
original mm info is Vegas nerve

1208
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,079
inflammation nobody knew Vegas nerves

1209
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,300
got inflamed nobody knew you got mystery

1210
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,160
nausea from vagus nerves that's mm info

1211
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,200
nobody knew you vomited because of a

1212
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,339
vagus nerve inflammation nobody knew you

1213
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,680
had anxiety because of your

1214
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:24,599
gastroparesis

1215
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,579
they didn't know why someone had

1216
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,680
gastroparesis

1217
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,880
um so Matt neem talked about the vagus

1218
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,540
nerves creating all these different

1219
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,619
symptoms and now once again they poached

1220
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,960
them

1221
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,060
it gets old man gets old but you just do

1222
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,680
one thing you know one thing in time so

1223
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,680
CBD I talk about it in here

1224
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,500
so get ready

1225
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,900
let's talk a little bit about CBD for a

1226
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,819
second here most chronic illnesses are

1227
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,819
caused by pathogens and toxins

1228
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,440
this is in the CBD section

1229
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:00,660
most chronic illnesses are caused by

1230
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,520
pathogens and toxins

1231
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,760
science and research

1232
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,160
and doctors did not know this

1233
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,660
it's originally mm info and published

1234
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,339
going all the way back

1235
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,460
chronic illnesses are caused by

1236
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:17,819
pathogens and toxins

1237
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:20,220
CBD is neither antiviral

1238
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:21,119
nor detoxifying so I just want to say

1239
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:25,260
this

1240
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,300
not trying to cause any riffs you guys I

1241
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:30,420
don't want you to dislike me more than

1242
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:32,520
you might already or whatever

1243
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:38,460
CBD oil

1244
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:40,200
is not antiviral nor is it detoxifying

1245
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:43,500
but get this

1246
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,760
everybody's taking CBD oil

1247
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,760
because they're sick

1248
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:51,960
it's not something you want you go out

1249
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,000
and take when you're not sick

1250
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,480
when you don't have a single symptom or

1251
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,780
a problem you just don't rush

1252
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:03,300
to somebody and grab some CBD oil if

1253
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,000
you're not sick with any symptoms you're

1254
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,740
getting your CBD oil because you have a

1255
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,020
symptom of some kind that's why you're

1256
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:11,880
going to buy your CBD oil hey try CBD

1257
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,440
oil worked for me okay good I'll go get

1258
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,359
it I have anxiety I got this I got that

1259
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,339
that's why you're taking CBD oil right

1260
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,880
you have a symptom

1261
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:24,000
but but your symptoms are caused by

1262
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,400
pathogens and toxins unless it's some

1263
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,740
serious emotional struggle which still

1264
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,900
could have toxins like Metals involved

1265
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,200
so your symptoms are caused by pathogens

1266
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:36,900
and toxins get ready

1267
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,640
CBD oil is neither antiviral

1268
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,119
anti-pathogen

1269
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,160
or detoxifying of the toxins and poisons

1270
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,940
I'm giving you just a little bit of a

1271
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,940
precursor

1272
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,940
and we're going to talk about the brain

1273
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,380
shot therapy cleanse challenge that's

1274
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,900
coming up too

1275
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,599
so

1276
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:01,619
so get get ready for this one

1277
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,380
in the past CBD oil was commonly sold as

1278
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:06,900
a treatment on its own

1279
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,780
you can only buy CBD oil

1280
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,460
that's CBD oil

1281
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,460
okay

1282
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,500
the lack of results with CBD oil

1283
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,020
Jackie V says I took it for anxiety I

1284
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,880
stopped using it after I found MN that's

1285
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,460
amazing that's incredible a lot of

1286
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,720
people have have gone through that

1287
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:29,760
get this the lack of results with CBD

1288
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,420
then spurred on a change with its usage

1289
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:36,000
by the way you guys bait and switch

1290
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:39,180
the chronically ill

1291
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,760
Get Fooled by the bait and switch

1292
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:44,460
the system out there are all think

1293
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,440
tanking about you guys anyone who's sick

1294
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,079
with a chronic symptom condition because

1295
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,040
you guys are the money makers for the

1296
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:52,800
system

1297
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,480
right because when you get sick you got

1298
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,700
to pay for everything right you're sick

1299
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,040
you got to look for answers whatever so

1300
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:01,380
the system is set up like this

1301
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,540
and if you say well you're selling a

1302
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,220
book well I'm not selling a course

1303
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,560
for five thousand dollars and I'm not

1304
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,319
withholding the information and

1305
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,940
wait until they come out in the library

1306
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,740
go ask your library when you get a

1307
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,260
chance I'm trying to get it in some

1308
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,319
libraries and get it take it out for

1309
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,720
free don't pay for it go to the library

1310
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:24,540
but the system set up

1311
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:27,240
because the system's rigged

1312
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:29,280
and here's how it works the bait and

1313
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,560
switch is happening with CBD oil right

1314
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,380
now as we speak

1315
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,300
the lack of results from CBD oil spurred

1316
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,720
on a change with its usage

1317
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,560
right now CBD oil is changing

1318
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,140
the strategy for CBD has evolved

1319
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:48,300
and CBD is now being sold mixed with

1320
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,980
other medicinals such as herbs vitamins

1321
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,200
and nutrients

1322
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,280
that offer better results medical medium

1323
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,220
info

1324
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,040
hasea says lemon balm has changed my

1325
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,380
life I used to have panic attacks every

1326
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,900
single night I used to use CBD as well

1327
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,520
never did anything lemon balm heals yay

1328
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,300
well that's what I heard my whole life

1329
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,880
that CBD CBD never did anything

1330
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,640
I never recommended it once to anyone

1331
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,260
CBD oil I still won't till today because

1332
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,260
there's better things out there

1333
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:24,420
I'm not anti-cbd if someone wants to

1334
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,280
partake in it it's like that's up to

1335
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,180
them that's their life you do what you

1336
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,819
want

1337
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,059
but get ready they have to add things

1338
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:35,280
that actually work in CBD now it's a

1339
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:37,140
bait and switch like lemon balm they're

1340
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,940
taking lemon balm which really does help

1341
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,420
people in their problems and they're

1342
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,780
adding it to the CBD oil right now

1343
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,339
it's a bait and switch once again but

1344
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,119
they're taking lemon balm because of

1345
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:50,119
medical medium

1346
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,940
also CBD oil is really expensive

1347
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,280
the strategy for CBD has evolved and CBD

1348
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:02,400
is now being sold mixed in with other

1349
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:04,440
medicinals such as herbs vitamins and

1350
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,680
nutrients that offer better results for

1351
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,800
individuals living with various symptoms

1352
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,500
this can be misleading for CBD users

1353
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,240
because CBD gets the spotlight so here's

1354
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,220
how it works here's how they really

1355
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,280
screw everybody over

1356
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,800
they sell you expensive CBD

1357
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,900
it doesn't work they found that out for

1358
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,160
years now so now they're looking to

1359
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,920
Medical medium

1360
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,420
like like lemon balm exploded in the

1361
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,859
world because of medical medium books

1362
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:38,520
and information exploded right now

1363
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:40,940
and if you eat best lemon balm ever is

1364
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:46,640
is on my directory by the way

1365
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:46,640
medicalme.com so lemon balm exploded

1366
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:51,599
and now

1367
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,099
they're like okay well we're seeing that

1368
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,859
medical median people are getting better

1369
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:59,059
with lemon balm let's take lemon balm

1370
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:59,059
and mix it with their CBD

1371
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,980
but they don't ever come clean and say

1372
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:06,839
we're gonna make an announcement and

1373
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:10,640
we're sorry that we totally screwed you

1374
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:10,640
over for the last two generations

1375
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,380
and we were really just confused and

1376
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,300
didn't know it didn't work

1377
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,980
so now we have to put things in that are

1378
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,020
medical mediums and actually put it in

1379
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,300
make it work nobody comes clean and Fest

1383
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,660

00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,119

in your CBD oil they'll say oh it was

00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:41,040
the CBD

1387
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,540
while it's the other constituents in the

1388
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,819

hit you

1433
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,220
I'm just so you're not caught off guard

1434
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,260
I'm trying to give you that little

1435
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:31,339
disclaimer like just be prepared I feel

1436
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:31,339
like I have to do that

1437
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,700
your brain and body have a quick

1438
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,400
response to medicinals delivered in

1439
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,460
liquid form what I call a shot designed

1440
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,599
to be highly absorbable in the mouth

1441
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:45,059
these brain shots there's a lot of words

1442
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,980
at once these brain shots valuable

1443
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:48,960
healing components can reach the brain

1444
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:53,940
fast so here's how it works

1445
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,220
these brain shots reach the brain quick

1446
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,140
these specially formulated shots have

1447
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,059
the ability to reset and rewire the

1448
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,859
brain and that's why they're so powerful

1449
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:04,079
because they have that ability to reset

1450
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:06,359
and rewire the brain to shock it out of

1451
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:09,720
patterns while at the same time reducing

1452
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:11,700
triggers reducing triggers

1453
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,079
that's what's incredible about it so

1454
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,460
let's give you the list of shots here

1455
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,500
and kind of showing you what they kind

1456
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,440
of look like right

1457
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,680
that's the toxic fragrances shot right

1458
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,680
there

1459
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,280
that's a negative energy exposure shot

1460
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,160

00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:32,420

it

1475
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,540
the medical medium Community when you're

1476
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,780
like invested into your healing process

1477
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:09,540

mad and angry that you're healing

00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,099
the Rules if you ever have ever seen any

1490
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,559
other health communities

1491
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,720
people say they're they they get a

1492
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:41,640
little better sometimes but then they

1493
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,800
just disappear and they're far worse

1494
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,420
than they ever were and you'll notice

1495
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,740
that the rate of people getting better

1496
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,359
at all the other communities doesn't

1500
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:57,900
and they stay all sick and they stay all

1501
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:00,380
Angry like if you go into some of the

1502
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,000
different communities out there

1503
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:04,740
and some of the different socials out

1504
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,079
there with the different kind of things

1505
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,220

it's just they're just done wrong it's

1511
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:22,319
just terrible and

1512
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,619
people fight

1513
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,760
they fight you on thinking you know they

1514
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,559
fight you on thinking you can just

1515
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,359
manage your conditions and symptoms but

1516
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,880

and tools to manage your condition

1521
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:42,420
medical meme info is done about managing

1522
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,859
it's about moving forward and getting

1523
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,819
better so we're in the brain shots right

1524
00:58:43,859 --> 00:58:46,440
here instead of just cutting through

1525
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:47,579
some of them that's the mold exposure

1526
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,619
shot

1527
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:51,359
SOC is going to pick out a bunch of

1528
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:53,520

for next week

1530
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,619
so we're going to be doing the brain

1531
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:57,359
shot

1532
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,920
therapy challenge

1533
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,859
next week

1534
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:04,140
it's gonna be fun

00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:05,640
I'm really excited about this make sure

1536
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,359
you sign up to my email that's the mold

1537
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:12,420
exposure shot that's the EMF and 5G

1538
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:13,799
exposure shot love that shot I love that

1539
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,720
shot

1540
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:18,359
just love it

1541
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,380
radiation exposure shot every time I

1542
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:22,500
travel

1543
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:26,700
every time I travel boom I'm doing that

1544
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:29,220
shot boom boom boom every time I travel

1545
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:31,380
every time I fly and I'm glowing in the

1546
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:34,020
dark after I fly

1547
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:35,520
it doesn't go away when you fly you got

1548
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,220
the radiation and you still from 10

1549
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,079
years ago it doesn't go away maybe if

1550
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,240
you're doing like active medical medium

1551
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,220
tools to get it to go away but if you

1552
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,319
don't do that radiation just sits in you

1553
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,760
you glow in the dark until you die down

1554
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,799
the road it's like you just glow in the

1555
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,780
dark every plane flight you just get

1556
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:54,599
more radiation and more rain then they

1557
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:57,000
make you go through those scanners

1558
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,760
go with the pat down

1559
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,339
I would never go through the scanner

1560
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,099
Janet Rose I agree with most of what you

1561
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:08,640
said about CBD oils on the market I've

1562
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:10,859
tried one from the from the flower in an

1563
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,319
alcohol base for delivery via drops on

1564
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:15,299
the tongue and it works fine expensive

1565
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:18,299
though you're getting the alcohol hit

1566
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:19,799
it's sorry

1567
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:22,440
sorry

1568
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:24,240
you're just getting the alcohol hit if I

1569
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,640
walked around with grain alcohol and

1570
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,040
dropped it on my tongue all day long I

1571
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,319
feel pretty damn fine too

1572
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,420
that's how sad that is

1573
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:35,900
it's like you know

1574
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,900
it's like

1575
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:42,180
I got this new CBD oil right here and

1576
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,660
I'm just gonna take a little bit of a

1577
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,660
hit now

1578
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:52,920
the grain alcohol getting into my system

1579
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,520
is just making me feel better

1580
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,099
that was nice it was a nice alcohol hit

1581
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,859
so once again you were doing like

1582
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:03,599
without realizing it I'm not I'm not

1583
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:05,040
being harsher look it's not about making

1584
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:07,619
fun or anything I want you to know this

1585
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,240
like thank you for being here I'm sorry

1586
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:11,700
if I'm irritating for real like if I'm

1587
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,619
irritating or snarky or sarcastic I'm

1588
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,359
really I apologize and I want you to

1589
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:17,099
know that like it's a true apology from

1590
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,799
my heart

1591
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:22,260
um but what happens is there's alcohol

1592
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:26,280
in that CBD that one

1593
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:29,160
and it's potent alcohol it's grain

1594
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:30,900
alcohol you're gonna get the grain

1595
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:33,119
alcohol hit and you're gonna think the

1596
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,920
CBD is working for you but it's the

1597
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,079
grain alcohol that you're getting a hit

1598
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,119
from it's calming you down but that's

1599
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,040
not good because that's a different

1600
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,079
thing that's something you don't want

1601
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,819
calming you down because it's been tried

1602
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,920
for hundreds of years and hundreds of

1603
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:48,960
years that's what men and women have

1604
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,119
done is drank themselves to death to

1605
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,680
calm themselves down and but you're not

1606
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,059
drinking yourself to death I get it

1607
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,980
you're just using a little bit of grain

1608
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:58,200
alcohol from your CBD but that's what's

1609
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,660
giving you the hit please know how it

1610
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:02,839
works so you understand

1611
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,839
foreign

1612
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,859
you gotta read the books about it

1613
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,240
alcohol is a whole other trick

1614
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:13,799
where am I

1615
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:19,400
here we are oh I am here

1616
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:19,400
Jen coffin says CBD did nothing for me

1617
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,920
toxic heavy metal exposure shot if you

1618
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:28,319
think you were exposed by

1619
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:30,359
Pharmaceuticals or anything else

1620
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,520
pesticide herbicide and fungicide

1621
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:34,380
exposure well why how would you have a

1622
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,400
fungicide exposure please tell me

1623
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,720
someone

1624
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,720
let me read to see

1625
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:48,119
this shot is an excellent tool when you

1626
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,859
inhale an unfamiliar or strange odor

1627
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,319
uh-huh

1628
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:54,900
you're exposed to recently delivered

1629
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:57,240
packages believe it or not recently

1630
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,220
delivered packages

1631
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,839
you gotta kind of like keep your nose

1632
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,700
away from them a little bit because the

1633
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:04,859
outside is usually contaminated with a

1634
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,140
lot of stuff until you get inside

1635
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:09,299
a neighbor sprays or treats their lawn

1636
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,799
with insecticide or chemical fertilizer

1637
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,359
treatment so if the neighbors spraying

1638
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,460
something which they always do or

1639
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:17,700
chemical treatments that are applied

1640
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:20,520
around an apartment building okay

1641
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,680
now I talk about okay here's another one

1642
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:25,140
right

1643
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,760
you're exposed to a town or city

1644
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,260
treatment that's occurring on the side

1645
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,640
of the street because the town and the

1646
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,099
cities are always spraying the most

1647
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:35,280
dangerous stuff they want to kill their

1648
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,380
people apparently not purposely entirely

1649
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,819
but there's a bigger industry that does

1650
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,099
want to kill people with all these

1651
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:43,680
chemicals above them

1652
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:46,859
you spot somebody with a tank on their

1653
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,619
back and a hose in their hand

1654
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:51,359
and they're spraying for weeds

1655
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:52,980
that's another one right there this is

1656
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:54,480
when you use the shot

1657
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,460
I mean no one's trying to kill anybody

1658
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,260
I'm just saying that the industries that

1659
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:01,079
create a lot of these chemicals

1660
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,240
definitely

1661
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:04,799
make people sick that's what I was

1662
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:07,079
saying

1663
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:09,119
you see a small to medium-sized truck

1664
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:11,160
with a large tank on the back and

1665
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:15,119
business signs on the side of that truck

1666
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:17,339
that say Lawn Care bug control or

1667
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,440
anything similar driving through your

1668
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:21,059
neighborhood meaning that chances are

1669
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,319
they just recently sprayed a bunch of

1670
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:23,880
different houses in your neighborhood

1671
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,260
and the wind's blowing it and you're

1672
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,420
exposed so then you get out your

1673
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:29,520
pesticide herbicide fungicide exposure

1674
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:31,920
shot check this out

1675
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,660
you're driving behind a truck that has a

1676
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,280
tank on the back with mysterious liquid

1677
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,660
leaking out of the tank I can't tell you

1678
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,520
how many times I've seen that over and

1679
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:41,280
over again and SOC told me when I was

1680
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:43,799
driving or in the car driving someone's

1681
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:46,079
driving that SSC told me that that tank

1682
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:47,760
is leaking deadly pesticides and it was

1683
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,980
just coming right out while you're

1684
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,460
driving behind it

1685
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,680
you spend time sitting in a park or

1686
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,200
visiting Parks or you spend time on a

1687
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,799
golf course right

1688
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:03,059
wish I had time to play golf

1689
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:06,359
insecticide treatments are sprayed in

1690
01:05:03,059 --> 01:05:08,460
classrooms classrooms they spray the

1691
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:10,980
crap out of classrooms I know teachers

1692
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,839
say well that's not true aw some say it

1693
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,460
is true because they know a lot of

1694
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:16,920
teachers will say aw you know you're

1695
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:19,140
pushing it too far there's no pesticide

1696
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,640
sprays in my classroom uh there is over

1697
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:24,540
the summer time

1698
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:26,760
because I know I have a family member

1699
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,099
who works in maintenance at one of the

1700
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:32,880
schools and tells me that here's how it

1701
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:35,099
works that when summertime comes and all

1702
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,640
the teachers are gone students are out

1703
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:40,619
and it's summertime they gas bomb with

1704
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,200
pesticides insecticides the entire

1705
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:46,099
schools and the classrooms

1706
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,099
heavily

1707
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,900
insecticide treatments are sprayed in

1708
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:55,859
classrooms from preschools preschool

1709
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:58,859
to elementary schools to universities

1710
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:59,940
and in dorm rooms especially common at

1711
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:01,799
the beginning of the school year so

1712
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,660
before the kids come in they spray for

1713
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:06,540
all the roaches and spray for all the

1714
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:08,579
bed bugs and they spray the dorm rooms

1715
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:11,040
so when the kids come in they get so

1716
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,660
much toxic heavy metal exposure from

1717
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,760
pesticides inside of them and other

1718
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:16,799
things too like the pesticide exposure

1719
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:19,319
and funguside exposure it's crazy let's

1720
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:22,440
go to another one here you live within

1721
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:24,539
25 miles of a conventional fruit or

1722
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,760
vegetable farm during its growing season

1723
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:28,859
so you could be living near a tomato

1724
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,000
Farm or something it's conventional and

1725
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,920

01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,960
you know that's that's a problem on its

1727
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,160

review

1801
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:23,580
Amazon.com or wherever you got the books

1802
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:25,920
or whatever please leave a review and

1803
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:29,160
how do you clean the books right you can

1804
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,600
take a hand towel this is a sponge

1805
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,640
sponge is probably not going to work

1806
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:34,140
unless it's just damp but you take a

1807
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,000
hand towel with a little bit of dish

1808
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:37,319
soap on it and you just clean it off you

1809
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,239
don't make it too wet because you don't

1810
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,980
want to soak your book and you clean off

1811
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:42,660
the grease from the conveyor belts that

1812
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:44,520
come from Amazon

1813
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:48,359
so here's how it works the books are

1814
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:50,940
minted they're pristine and clean and

1815
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,460
fresh and new and then they go to the

1816
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:55,739
warehouse at Amazon and then Amazon has

1817
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:57,300
conveyor belts that that there's grease

1818
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:59,880
on because they have to grease the

1819
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,679
conveyor belts and then the worker God

1820
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,380
bless their soul takes the medical

1821
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,660
medium book and they take it and they

1822
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:08,940
throw it on the conveyor belt rightfully

1823
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:11,219
so it's their job and the book is just

1824
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:13,440
rolling down the conveyor belts and then

1825
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,780
by the time it gets into the box it's

1826
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,120
got a grease much another smudge another

1827
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:21,120
smudge some dirt here and even some food

1828
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,620
on here for some you know person eating

1829
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,260
or whatever it is or drinking something

1830
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:27,300
and then ask for a new book if you don't

1831
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,300
like how it came ask Amazon for a new

1832
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:32,699
book or just clean it and the reason why

1833
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:35,159
I'm I'm saying this is because people

1834
01:10:32,699 --> 01:10:38,219
then get mad at me and think I gave them

1835
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:39,719
a used book which is think that's think

1836
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:41,400
that's not true no they've done it and

1837
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:44,280
they've given me one stars because of it

1838
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:47,159
people also ask because I saw that

1839
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:48,900
before which book to do

1840
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:51,179
so which book

1841
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,219
which book

1842
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:55,440
ready I'm gonna land on the book to get

1843
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:58,320
I'm definitely gonna land right on the

1844
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:01,260
book that you have to get okay I want

1845
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,060
you to get the book that it lands on get

1846
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,460
ready which book is it gonna be first

1847
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:07,739
which But first you get both books is

1848
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:11,280
what you get first that's where we land

1849
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:13,140
because it's one book one gigantic book

1850
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,300
that the publisher could not publish and

1851
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:18,540
the printer could not print it's too big

1852
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:21,840
it's over 1200 Pages they're over 600

1853
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:24,300
Pages a piece and it's very heavy and

1854
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:27,840
the problem is the publisher said we

1855
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:30,060
can't sell a 12 pound book we can't sell

1856
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,040
a 10 pound whatever book No One's Gonna

1857
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,400
Be able to do anything so they had to

1858
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:37,199
split it they're two books equally as

1859
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,880

1860
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:40,320
