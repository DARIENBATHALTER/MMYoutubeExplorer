1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,660
melons are one of my favorite foods

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,519
one of my favorite fruits when melon

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,139
season comes around I like to have

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,639
spirulina with my melon I want to show

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,679
you how cool this is

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,679
check this out I'm gonna crack this open

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,180
here we go and then I'm going to scoop

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,220
the seeds out

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,840
just like this

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,199
I'm gonna try to do it so you guys can

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,199
see

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,399
I like melons when they're juicy

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,579
when they're ripe not too hard and

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,100
crunchy I will eat a melon if it's like

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,559
somewhat crunchy

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
but it's not my favorite I like to have

17
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,700
them when they're sweet and juicy and

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,320
ripe but you can also you gotta look out

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,300
because you might accidentally eat an

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,800
overripe melon which isn't fun you can

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,420
taste it where it's kind of fermented

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,280
and stuff this one's perfect I'm pretty

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,140
sure I'm gonna put the spoon in and

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,659
that's the way I like it maybe a little

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,520
bit more riper than that so here's what

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,100
I like to do I like to take spirulina

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,520
and this is emergy spirulina

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,260
right here I've endorsed this company I

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,520
work with these guys and there's so many

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,040
reasons why

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,740
they're the only ones out there that I

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,420
can find that don't put anti-caking and

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,060
anti-binders

34
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,460
in here so there's no agents hidden in

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,040
here that's not disclosed because

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,900
companies are allowed to stick these

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,820
anti-caking agents inside their

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,220
spirulina or inside all their different

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,079
green powders protein powders and all

40
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,759
that and then they won't put it on the

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,880
label you'll never know you're eating

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,240
that well these guys don't do it they

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,100
won't that alone is such a big deal for

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,680
me because it's scary to know there's

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,720
things inside your supplements that you

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,820
don't know about you can't identify you

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,860
have no idea what it is but it's in

48
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,240
there right these guys don't do that so

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,979
here's what I like to do with Spirulina

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,719
for years I've been putting spirulina in

51
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,720
my melons

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,360
so what I'll do is I'll just take a

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,860
little bit like this and spirulina

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,860
is incredible for you

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,599
so essential fatty acids are in

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,599
spirulina

57
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,780
just putting some in there there you go

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
so I want to show you what this looks

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,200
like so

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,819
I'm gonna put some more

61
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,720
beta-carotene

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,280
essential fatty acids

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,440
there you go so many nutrients

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,140
phytochemical compounds

65
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,660
so I like to eat it this way I'll take

66
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,459
it to my office whatever I'll I'll

67
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,200
actually take it to go

68
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,480
it can get messy so you got to look out

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,940
because spirulina can be messy but it's

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,680
such a powerful

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,319
incredible

72
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,379
source of so many different nutrients

73
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,540
look at the color all on its own I mean

74
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,000
you know when you see that and the

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,519
purity of the Bemidji spirulina

76
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,500
is unmatched

77
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,260
it's not from China it's not sourced

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,739
from China and you'll see that out there

79
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,599
spirulina that stores from China this is

80
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,599
from the U.S

81
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,640
it's the purest form I've ever seen

82
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,319
you can taste it

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,540
you can see it

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,780
and if it ever clumps

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,940
that's fine because you know there's no

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,200
agents in there stopping it from

87
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,360
clumping

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,000
and that's not a good thing

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,220
but so if it ever does Clump that's a

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,799
natural progression of something that's

91
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,720
so pure it doesn't have something

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,959
interfering with it that's not being

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,239
disclosed on the bottle so anyway you

94
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,120
guys that's spirulina inside the melon

95
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,620
that's how I eat it I love doing it this

96
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,620
way try it sometime
