[40.20 - 44.60] rocket science and medicine I know it's
[42.72 - 46.80] a good one and you know putting them
[44.60 - 48.64] both together like that and I said okay
[46.80 - 49.92] oh I didn't know I didn't know science
[48.64 - 51.96] and research knew everything about
[49.92 - 53.76] chronic illness I didn't know that I
[51.96 - 55.96] didn't know they had it all in the bag I
[53.76 - 57.92] didn't know they had it all fixed that's

[82.80 - 86.96] great thanks thanks for educating me
[84.68 - 88.56] thank you thank you well science of
[86.96 - 90.44] research doesn't have it figured out
[88.56 - 94.52] bottom line you guys know that why is
[90.44 - 96.52] anybody sick why I mean I mean it's
[94.52 - 98.72] unbelievable I say this all the time I
[96.52 - 101.84] run into young people all the time that
[98.72 - 103.72] have been convinced entr trenched in the
[101.84 - 106.60] fact that science and research is so
[103.72 - 108.32] Advanced that technology is so Advanced
[106.60 - 109.68] and they're using all their devices and
[108.32 - 111.76] everything else and they're in school
[109.68 - 113.48] and they're using devices in school and
[111.76 - 114.96] and you know and the car's got all these
[113.48 - 116.68] computers in it and they just they think
[114.96 - 118.00] everything's figured out and then when
[116.68 - 121.44] they start getting sick they're like
[118.00 - 124.08] Blown Away young people are like blown
[121.44 - 126.08] away like wait a minute you mean I have
[124.08 - 127.64] to live with this symptom I just can't
[126.08 - 129.56] go to the doctor and take an antibiotic
[127.64 - 133.00] and it all go away and they're like
[129.56 - 135.40] literally blow they're crushed literally
[133.00 - 137.16] crushed and then the Awakening starts to
[135.40 - 138.84] happen which shouldn't have to happen
[137.16 - 142.72] with young people they should not be
[138.84 - 144.88] forced into an Awakening at a young age
[142.72 - 148.20] meaning like an Awakening of like oh my
[144.88 - 150.92] God this world sucks yeah this world
[148.20 - 152.68] sucks unbelievable it should not happen
[150.92 - 154.92] that way for young people cuz it breaks
[152.68 - 157.20] their Spirit it literally breaks their
[154.92 - 160.04] Spirit wait a minute my body's attacking
[157.20 - 162.96] myself what does that mean I'm 19 years
[160.04 - 164.52] old I'm 15 years old I'm 21 years old
[162.96 - 167.64] what do what do you mean my body's
[164.52 - 169.72] attacking itself it's destroying it CS
[167.64 - 172.16] it's destroying itself you don't have
[169.72 - 175.80] the answers this is unbelievable you
[172.16 - 178.24] know and it happens every day every day
[175.80 - 180.64] Millions though of Americans overall all
[178.24 - 182.36] ages it happens every day so science and
[180.64 - 184.08] research doesn't have it figured out you
[182.36 - 186.04] know what I mean I noticed the trolls
[184.08 - 188.00] are all into like he knows nothing
[186.04 - 190.24] science he doesn't it's science when you
[188.00 - 191.60] see like the Clones I call them clones
[190.24 - 193.52] you know cuz I don't like calling them
[191.60 - 195.52] trolls because trolls I think is like a
[193.52 - 196.88] a nice word it's like it's doesn't
[195.52 - 198.60] describe them you know it's like
[196.88 - 200.20] Dungeons and Dragons like trolls you
[198.60 - 201.76] know the whole bit it's just like it's
[200.20 - 203.88] the trolls are kind of friendly to some
[201.76 - 205.56] degree so you know I call them clones
[203.88 - 207.20] they're all they all their hatred is all
[205.56 - 208.92] the same inside and they all say the
[207.20 - 209.96] same thing so I they're like cloning off
[208.92 - 212.20] each other something so kind of
[209.96 - 214.92] genetically altered modified organism or
[212.20 - 216.48] whatever it is and the bottom line is
[214.92 - 219.08] and you know meanwhile what about the
[216.48 - 221.96] people suffering I notice the trolls
[219.08 - 223.48] most of them have not suffered they have
[221.96 - 224.92] not suffered they have not struggled
[223.48 - 227.40] they haven't had neuro fatigue they
[224.92 - 230.80] don't know what it's like like to be in
[227.40 - 232.36] the trenches with no answers they don't
[230.80 - 235.20] know what it's like they don't try the
[232.36 - 237.48] celery juice so they can actually heal

[309.76 - 314.16] here's the deal healing the liver this
[311.36 - 316.88] is going to be a great show and the deal
[314.16 - 318.52] is about this is I can only though cover
[316.88 - 319.76] certain aspects about healing the liver
[318.52 - 321.20] meaning I'm going to cover a lot don't
[319.76 - 324.28] get me wrong this is going to be a big
[321.20 - 326.60] show but you still want to get the book
[324.28 - 328.84] because this book is so huge it's so big
[326.60 - 331.80] it's like 200,000 word count it's a
[328.84 - 334.16] massive book so much information you got
[331.80 - 335.48] there's so much to learn and heal and
[334.16 - 337.00] all the different conditions in
[335.48 - 338.72] everything I mean even the title of the
[337.00 - 340.52] book The subtitle of the book only can
[338.72 - 342.92] scratch a few if there was no room for
[340.52 - 345.96] the subtitle so it's like answers to
[342.92 - 348.20] eczema psoriasis diabetes strep strep is
[345.96 - 350.24] behind everything like acne sibo then
[348.20 - 352.04] you got Gout bloating gall stone
[350.24 - 354.20] gallbladder problems adrenal stress
[352.04 - 356.00] fatigue fatty liver weight issues cuz
[354.20 - 357.08] everybody's got weight issues and if you
[356.00 - 358.88] don't have a weight issue you're going
[357.08 - 360.80] to have one later because of your liver
[358.88 - 362.68] I'm just for warning everybody I've seen
[360.80 - 364.16] it happen I've been in this for decades
[362.68 - 365.56] if you don't have a weight issue now
[364.16 - 367.56] because you're 28 years old and you seem
[365.56 - 369.08] to be doing okay and you flipped on to
[367.56 - 370.44] some vegan food and you're doing all
[369.08 - 372.04] right and you're exercising or you
[370.44 - 373.40] flipped onto a paleo diet and you're
[372.04 - 374.56] doing okay and you're exercising and you
[373.40 - 376.04] don't have any weight problems right now
[374.56 - 377.80] you're going to have it later unless you
[376.04 - 379.20] learn what to do for your liver I've
[377.80 - 380.44] seen it over and over again everybody
[379.20 - 381.92] thinks they're like all good and
[380.44 - 383.76] indestructible and everything's all
[381.92 - 386.68] happy and then they get the the weight G
[383.76 - 388.64] no matter what later whether they're 35
[386.68 - 389.96] or 38 and they get it or whatever
[388.64 - 392.20] happens they still get it it's
[389.96 - 395.24] unbelievable and so you know also on the
[392.20 - 396.64] subtitle sibo and autoimmune disease
[395.24 - 398.52] that's just a fraction of what's in the
[396.64 - 400.32] book so when you know that that I can
[398.52 - 402.36] only cover so much so this is about
[400.32 - 404.64] healing the liver and where do we start
[402.36 - 406.76] we start with one of the most important
[404.64 - 408.20] aspects what's inside your liver what's
[406.76 - 409.72] wrong with your liver to begin with we
[408.20 - 411.84] come here with sick livers we're born
[409.72 - 414.12] with livers that are weakened and a lot
[411.84 - 416.40] of toxins are passed down passed down
[414.12 - 418.52] from Generations okay then we get
[416.40 - 420.28] exposed to toxins all through the course
[418.52 - 422.84] of it if you think there's nothing in
[420.28 - 426.12] your liver you're sadly mistaken and
[422.84 - 427.80] terribly wrong very important to know
[426.12 - 429.96] and then there's also the different
[427.80 - 431.92] depths of the liver and that's another
[429.96 - 434.08] thing too to heal your liver you got to
[431.92 - 435.64] get to the core there's a subsurface
[434.08 - 438.12] there's the surface the subsurface and
[435.64 - 441.12] the inner core the three levels of the
[438.12 - 443.64] liver and and where where toxins are
[441.12 - 445.56] stored by the liver to protect your butt
[443.64 - 447.68] so this is all information is critical
[445.56 - 448.80] first of all the for warning everybody
[447.68 - 450.96] because there's a lot of new people that
[448.80 - 452.92] listen to the podcasts and radio shows
[450.96 - 454.40] for warn you the information that always
[452.92 - 456.88] comes from me in here is not out there
[454.40 - 459.16] yet it's just never out there yet and
[456.88 - 461.44] and and some of it has escaped from all
[459.16 - 463.16] the work I've done and gotten out there
[461.44 - 465.52] and and what not meaning like been out
[463.16 - 466.88] there even even science has caught up
[465.52 - 468.20] science of research caught up to speed
[466.88 - 471.60] with a few things that I already
[468.20 - 473.20] documented long before them and and so
[471.60 - 475.36] so there's that information is out there
[473.20 - 477.12] but today with you know with this and
[475.36 - 478.88] much of the radio shows none of the in
[477.12 - 480.80] it's all information you're never going
[478.88 - 482.40] to hear read any books or find online
[480.80 - 483.72] just for warning you so you don't jump
[482.40 - 486.68] off the show and say all right let me
[483.72 - 488.72] look into this yeah good luck cuz
[486.68 - 490.32] exactly it's not going to be there so
[488.72 - 493.12] there's the petrochemicals group it's
[490.32 - 494.48] inside our liver all the time Plastics
[493.12 - 495.44] okay so it's important to know and I
[494.48 - 497.20] have to cover some of these
[495.44 - 499.12] troublemakers I call it so in Liver
[497.20 - 501.56] Rescue I call it troublemakers there's
[499.12 - 503.80] gasoline we pump our own gas now we
[501.56 - 506.04] inhale it you name it we didn't pump her
[503.80 - 508.12] own gas only the gas station attend
[506.04 - 511.24] attendance actually got poisoned that
[508.12 - 513.44] was it only those poor guys okay those
[511.24 - 516.08] are the ones that got poisoned that was
[513.44 - 518.08] it they pumped gas all day in people's
[516.08 - 519.92] cars they got it on their hands all day
[518.08 - 521.92] they breathe it and inhaled it all day
[519.92 - 524.12] now we pump gas now our 16-year-old
[521.92 - 526.24] daughters pump gas okay and getting
[524.12 - 528.60] exposure early on something that never
[526.24 - 531.08] existed before something that never
[528.60 - 532.52] existed before it's unbelievable so you
[531.08 - 533.84] have to do things to care for your liver
[532.52 - 536.60] that's why the show is called healing
[533.84 - 537.96] your liver gasoline wouldn't believe the
[536.60 - 539.84] solvents in there and the chemicals that
[537.96 - 541.52] are in there unbelievable and what it
[539.84 - 544.52] does and how that petrochemical gets
[541.52 - 546.12] inside the liver Plastics is one of them
[544.52 - 548.32] it's a whole another one they go into
[546.12 - 550.84] deep parts of the liver diesel just
[548.32 - 553.28] breathing in breathing in a delivery
[550.84 - 554.84] truck in front of you or in front of
[553.28 - 556.20] front of your apartment or front of your
[554.84 - 559.12] house or wherever you live or whatever
[556.20 - 560.64] you're doing breathing that in multiple
[559.12 - 562.92] times in your life it goes into the
[560.64 - 564.44] liver that's just a fraction have you
[562.92 - 566.44] ever checked your oil and got it on your
[564.44 - 569.24] finger one time in your life it's in
[566.44 - 571.16] your liver another thing exhaust fumes
[569.24 - 573.28] always inside the liver they just don't
[571.16 - 574.56] disappear they go in the liver in the
[573.28 - 576.00] bloodstream through the lungs and
[574.56 - 576.96] instantly in the liver to protect your
[576.00 - 579.64] heart and
[576.96 - 581.88] brain because Li delivers your your your
[579.64 - 583.32] filter kerosene if you've ever played

[680.68 - 685.92] herbicides everywhere inner food in the
[683.56 - 688.28] Parks everything sprayed on the sides of
[685.92 - 689.60] the roads sprayed Everywhere by towns
[688.28 - 691.36] and cities and what that are
[689.60 - 693.12] commissioned to kill us with all the
[691.36 - 694.80] with all those sprays and all those
[693.12 - 699.52] poisons just so you know the chemical
[694.80 - 701.80] companies literally use use our you know

[718.32 - 722.48] that crap and there you know all that
[720.12 - 724.32] stuff floating in it's it's endless
[722.48 - 726.32] inside the liver endless inside the
[724.32 - 728.92] liver the chemical companies literally
[726.32 - 733.12] indoctrinate in you know IND
[728.92 - 735.44] indoctrinate um places and you know in
[733.12 - 737.48] towns and cities and whatnot so that
[735.44 - 740.00] they can just continue to actually help
[737.48 - 742.32] kill us slowly it's
[740.00 - 745.16] unbelievable how it works all goes
[742.32 - 747.36] inside liver all goes inside the liver
[745.16 - 749.72] puster DDT in the liver from long before
[747.36 - 752.20] we were born and also floating in the
[749.72 - 754.20] air now there's fungicides everywhere
[752.20 - 755.96] it's on clothing you name it buy new
[754.20 - 757.40] clothing it's got fungicides on it
[755.96 - 760.04] unless it's some organic thing you
[757.40 - 761.56] bought you can't hide from it all you
[760.04 - 762.80] can try to hide from it a little bit
[761.56 - 764.12] protect yourself you can protect
[762.80 - 765.60] yourself a little bit but we have to
[764.12 - 767.52] figure out how to heal the liver and get
[765.60 - 769.00] this out of the liver so you don't get
[767.52 - 771.08] sick so you don't get the hot flashes
[769.00 - 773.44] later the heart palpitations the viral
[771.08 - 775.12] diseases the viral situations all the
[773.44 - 776.68] different things the Hashimoto because
[775.12 - 778.44] of you know Epstein bar flourishing
[776.68 - 780.36] inside the liver so you don't get sick
[778.44 - 782.36] so you don't get all these problems just
[780.36 - 785.12] everything under the sun can happen tons
[782.36 - 787.40] of acne tons of this tons of that it's
[785.12 - 790.40] all because the liver Harbors bacteria
[787.40 - 793.16] viruses lots of poisons we can heal our
[790.40 - 795.52] liver this information doesn't exist out
[793.16 - 797.92] there it's beyond me that's why I had to
[795.52 - 798.88] put this out there I was so sick sick
[797.92 - 802.40] and
[798.88 - 804.04] tired sick and tired you know I always I
[802.40 - 805.68] I always have this like thing where I
[804.04 - 807.00] have this hope and this Faith thing
[805.68 - 809.20] because I have a lot of faith and a lot
[807.00 - 811.88] of Hope and it and it seems to it seems
[809.20 - 814.08] to take over and when it takes over I
[811.88 - 816.08] say oh yeah no no there's going to be
[814.08 - 817.72] some cool trendy doctors that are out in
[816.08 - 819.28] the circuit that people all know they're
[817.72 - 821.40] going to figure things out they're not
[819.28 - 823.32] just going to be talking stupid about uh
[821.40 - 825.12] you know lower carbs and here's what you
[823.32 - 826.56] got to eat now and here's what you got
[825.12 - 828.48] to do and then they'll take my celery
[826.56 - 829.48] juice the whole Spirit celery juice
[828.48 - 830.80] thing and they'll start saying it's
[829.48 - 832.24] theirs or something whatever whatever
[830.80 - 833.92] they do you know I sit back I say fine
[832.24 - 835.56] let everybody do what they want to do
[833.92 - 837.28] but but I'm thinking someone's going to
[835.56 - 838.52] figure things out by now and they don't
[837.28 - 840.36] and then I have to kick it up a notch
[838.52 - 841.68] every time I sit back and I try to take
[840.36 - 843.72] a break for a little bit and I try to
[841.68 - 845.32] rest a little and say I have hope and I
[843.72 - 847.24] have faith that all that you know the
[845.32 - 849.56] the so-called experts and science and
[847.24 - 851.36] research are going to actually be able
[849.56 - 853.36] to figure a fraction of what I have to
[851.36 - 855.52] deliver just a fraction I have faith and
[853.36 - 857.24] I tell spirit let me just kick back let
[855.52 - 858.96] me kick back and chill a little bit
[857.24 - 861.32] because I have faith and hope and I
[858.96 - 863.48] always get let down and disappointed and
[861.32 - 865.96] then have to make a 200,000 word
[863.48 - 867.68] manuscript called Liver Rescue and
[865.96 - 868.96] literally almost put myself in the grave
[867.68 - 870.88] doing it cuz you wouldn't believe how
[868.96 - 873.52] hard it was to write this book because I
[870.88 - 876.12] can't I get sick and tired of it all
[873.52 - 878.56] it's unbelievable all right back to this
[876.12 - 880.56] can't help it you guys
[878.56 - 882.76] fluoride wait first of all smoke
[880.56 - 884.88] exposure of any kind any kind of smoke
[882.76 - 887.92] exposure it's in the liver whatever was
[884.88 - 890.28] whatever was burning in that smoke like
[887.92 - 892.72] plastic burning across the country
[890.28 - 895.28] everywhere from California all the way
[892.72 - 897.40] to Florida all the way to the East Coast
[895.28 - 899.68] West Coast all the way everywhere
[897.40 - 901.32] plastic burning every everywhere burning
[899.68 - 903.28] burning burning agricultural
[901.32 - 905.44] conventional agricultural burning
[903.28 - 907.28] plastic everywhere it's in the air it's
[905.44 - 910.32] smoke it's also plastic it's in our
[907.28 - 911.84] lungs it hurts people fluoride ever get
[910.32 - 913.32] a fluoride treatment no you don't have
[911.84 - 915.28] to just a little bit of water in a
[913.32 - 916.64] restaurant sure you get in a restaurant
[915.28 - 919.68] there's fluoride in the water have you
[916.64 - 921.28] had it yeah there's fluoride in in Soda
[919.68 - 922.68] Pop there's fluoride in everything so
[921.28 - 925.68] that's a whole another thing
[922.68 - 927.68] chlorine swimming in pools all of that
[925.68 - 929.84] chlorine gets us in just one way or
[927.68 - 931.04] another it's unbelievable able you know
[929.84 - 933.24] and then there's the whole thing with
[931.04 - 934.80] the the problematic food chemical group
[933.24 - 936.32] that sits inside the liver too at the
[934.80 - 938.00] three different levels you know that I
[936.32 - 939.96] talk about and I describe this in detail
[938.00 - 943.12] in the book I can't cover a fraction of
[939.96 - 945.36] this aspart Ane espartan right aspart
[943.12 - 947.08] tene that's another thing too believe me
[945.36 - 949.12] we all have a little bit in us one way
[947.08 - 951.04] or another somehow some some way
[949.12 - 952.76] artificial sweeteners y we all have it
[951.04 - 955.00] in US somehow some way where is it still
[952.76 - 956.76] sitting inside the liver has it left no
[955.00 - 958.00] it hasn't left because we're on high fat
[956.76 - 959.28] diets which is part of what I'm doing
[958.00 - 960.60] with healing the liver here talking
[959.28 - 963.00] about how you have to lower the fats in
[960.60 - 965.16] your diet contrary to this to the silly
[963.00 - 967.84] Trend out there of fats fats fats just
[965.16 - 970.80] just make people sick and what happens
[967.84 - 973.56] is it's really kind of deceiving and
[970.80 - 975.24] Elusive where you know where you take
[973.56 - 976.88] out the processed foods you take out the
[975.24 - 978.12] gluten you take out stuff like that for
[976.88 - 979.88] the first time or you take it out
[978.12 - 982.20] seriously or you go raw or whatever it
[979.88 - 983.68] is and just whatever it is or you just
[982.20 - 985.16] you're you're paleo or something or
[983.68 - 986.40] you're something that's not paleo but
[985.16 - 987.60] you're look you know you're only eating
[986.40 - 988.96] a little bit of animal protein and
[987.60 - 990.76] bringing in more fruits and vegetables
[988.96 - 991.84] now because they're finally somebody's
[990.76 - 993.08] finally starting to figure out that
[991.84 - 995.40] fruits and vegetables are the very thing
[993.08 - 997.16] that heals everybody whatever it is if
[995.40 - 999.12] you're still high fat whether it's
[997.16 - 1001.40] plant-based high fat or plant-based fats
[999.12 - 1003.68] or whatever it is and still doing some
[1001.40 - 1004.96] animal fat whatever whatever you're
[1003.68 - 1006.44] you're you're just still going to run
[1004.96 - 1008.72] into trouble and you're not going to get
[1006.44 - 1010.28] what I'm saying is in the liver ever out
[1008.72 - 1011.76] and there will be a disease somehow
[1010.28 - 1014.12] coming down the line whether you're 70
[1011.76 - 1015.52] years old 80 years old 60 years old and
[1014.12 - 1017.88] maybe does doesn't matter to somebody
[1015.52 - 1018.96] who's 24 years old 23 years old because
[1017.88 - 1021.24] you never think you're going to ever
[1018.96 - 1024.68] turn 70 you never think you're going to
[1021.24 - 1027.04] be 70 23y old will never believe they'll
[1024.68 - 1030.04] never believe they'll be 70 years
[1027.04 - 1031.80] old or they'll just think well I'm
[1030.04 - 1035.04] supposed to live forever right it's
[1031.80 - 1037.60] unbelievable so here's the deal all
[1035.04 - 1039.88] right there's MSG inside our liver tons
[1037.60 - 1042.08] of it for most people even nutritional
[1039.88 - 1043.64] yeast the cleanest nicest funnest
[1042.08 - 1045.96] nutritional yeast you can find has
[1043.64 - 1047.64] glutamic acid in it naturally occurring
[1045.96 - 1050.08] if it isn't even the crappy nutritional
[1047.64 - 1053.36] yeast that actually has MSG literally
[1050.08 - 1055.04] laed in it so either way it's it's
[1053.36 - 1057.00] nutritional yeast is disastrous
[1055.04 - 1058.96] everybody's pouring it on their food oh
[1057.00 - 1060.12] I have people I put a recipe out on
[1058.96 - 1062.52] social media and then you'll have
[1060.12 - 1065.36] comments saying that recipe really looks
[1062.52 - 1066.80] good but it would be so much better
[1065.36 - 1069.08] easily so much better if you knew about
[1066.80 - 1070.88] nutritional yeast Anthony like what how
[1069.08 - 1073.24] about do you know about nutritional
[1070.88 - 1075.16] yeast about it being so toxic for the
[1073.24 - 1077.68] liver fill the glutamic acid no matter
[1075.16 - 1079.24] what in good company or great product or
[1077.68 - 1081.68] whatever it is
[1079.24 - 1084.32] it's bad stuff it's inside the liver
[1081.68 - 1086.48] glutamic acid MSG for Malahide
[1084.32 - 1088.72] everywhere it's in it's all kinds of
[1086.48 - 1090.44] stuff preservatives like the whole bit
[1088.72 - 1093.20] so I mean where does it end I mean am I
[1090.44 - 1096.16] boring you guys cuz I hope not I hope
[1093.20 - 1097.56] I'm not boring you problematic Foods
[1096.16 - 1100.84] what about those let me tell you
[1097.56 - 1103.20] something about eggs eggs keep pathogens
[1100.84 - 1106.40] that thrive inside the liver alive they
[1103.20 - 1108.84] eat eggs it's the whole point someone
[1106.40 - 1110.92] said to me and they still do here like
[1108.84 - 1113.72] well no my eggs are organic they're free
[1110.92 - 1116.20] range they're just grass-fed whatever it
[1113.72 - 1118.20] is they'll be like you know what I mean
[1116.20 - 1120.56] they're like no the chickens run wild
[1118.20 - 1123.00] they have their own they're fed organic
[1120.56 - 1124.40] scraps of food organic everything
[1123.00 - 1126.32] they're just in the field they're
[1124.40 - 1129.24] pecking away they're in they're not
[1126.32 - 1131.76] caged they're free range or free pasture
[1129.24 - 1133.36] whatever all of it and I say okay it
[1131.76 - 1134.72] sounds good sounds amazing cuz if you're
[1133.36 - 1137.48] going to eat an egg that's the kind of
[1134.72 - 1141.56] egg you eat you better believe it but
[1137.48 - 1143.48] see eggs were used to raise in Labs the
[1141.56 - 1145.84] viruses that are tormenting everybody in
[1143.48 - 1148.60] autoimmune disease on any and on all
[1145.84 - 1151.56] levels that's the whole point all the
[1148.60 - 1154.72] Epstein bars all the hhv sixes sevens
[1151.56 - 1158.08] eights nines 10 undiscovered 10 11 12 13
[1154.72 - 1160.92] 14 15 16 that I actually talk about are
[1158.08 - 1162.32] are are fed eggs that's how they're
[1160.92 - 1165.00] they're they're alive that's how they
[1162.32 - 1167.08] survive that's how they stay
[1165.00 - 1169.28] alive and they've they've they've
[1167.08 - 1170.44] escaped over the years in different ways
[1169.28 - 1172.44] through Medical Treatments and
[1170.44 - 1174.12] everything else and and they end up in
[1172.44 - 1175.68] people and people pass them around on
[1174.12 - 1178.00] top of it and they mutate it's
[1175.68 - 1180.68] unbelievable and the liver Harbors all
[1178.00 - 1183.44] these Harbors them and that's why
[1180.68 - 1186.44] everybody gets all the different things
[1183.44 - 1189.08] that's how they get all the different
[1186.44 - 1191.28] conditions all of them they they get the
[1189.08 - 1192.68] 88 conditions I have listed in thyroid
[1191.28 - 1194.24] healing the book thyroid healing they
[1192.68 - 1195.96] get the conditions I have listed
[1194.24 - 1197.68] multiple sclerosis Hashim Modas whatever
[1195.96 - 1199.60] rumat arthritis Lyme disease that I have
[1197.68 - 1201.56] listed in medical medium book one they
[1199.60 - 1203.72] get that's where it all comes from eat
[1201.56 - 1206.20] eggs you feed the viruses I'm the only
[1203.72 - 1210.44] one talking about that the only one that
[1206.20 - 1211.84] knows that I mean it's unbelievable and

[1393.56 - 1398.84] juice helps you heal from Bad salts
[1396.20 - 1401.00] toxic salts that were used it's why you
[1398.84 - 1403.72] can heal from celery juice cuz toxic
[1401.00 - 1406.00] salts sit inside the liver stored and
[1403.72 - 1408.60] then when you eat vinegar it pickles the
[1406.00 - 1411.12] liver a pickle action occurs
[1408.60 - 1413.00] inside the liver a pickling because your
[1411.12 - 1415.76] bloodstream is also filled with sodium
[1413.00 - 1417.56] so it's a pickling that occurs so you
[1415.76 - 1419.28] got to be careful celery juice helps
[1417.56 - 1421.64] reverse this pickling instead of
[1419.28 - 1424.84] promoting it it's amazing it's like a

[1887.88 - 1891.60] fast in the seat belts yeah I guess
[1890.08 - 1893.36] that's all I could say get some herbal
[1891.60 - 1894.88] tea too maybe some lemon balm tea which
[1893.36 - 1897.28] is incredible for the liver and I'm
[1894.88 - 1901.40] about to talk about that in a little
[1897.28 - 1906.28] bit oh my God throat's getting
[1901.40 - 1909.96] dry so powerful Foods powerful
[1906.28 - 1911.32] herbs powerful supplements for the liver
[1909.96 - 1913.48] I'm going to tell you something right
[1911.32 - 1916.80] now if you hear somewhere like oh
[1913.48 - 1920.00] supplements are bad for the body they're
[1916.80 - 1923.08] bad B for your health it's herbs only
[1920.00 - 1928.24] herbs only herbs
[1923.08 - 1930.84] only not true at all not true at all
[1928.24 - 1935.28] very interesting okay I've had people
[1930.84 - 1937.00] with chronic illness dying in their beds
[1935.28 - 1939.92] families getting a hold of me over the
[1937.00 - 1944.36] years desperate while they're laying
[1939.92 - 1946.68] there laying there in agony okay and
[1944.36 - 1950.04] literally all it took was the right kind
[1946.68 - 1952.44] of be 12 to get that person recovering
[1950.04 - 1954.00] to make the first recovery the first
[1952.44 - 1956.72] literally where they can use their arms
[1954.00 - 1959.08] and legs crawl out of bed and start to
[1956.72 - 1963.12] heal and start to eat again and it was
[1959.08 - 1965.84] just B12 by itself the right kind of B12
[1963.12 - 1967.80] by itself I've witnessed that I've seen
[1965.84 - 1971.00] it happen I've helped people throughout
[1967.80 - 1974.36] the years do that and b12 is a
[1971.00 - 1976.00] supplement it's not an herb so when you
[1974.36 - 1977.64] see that on Instagram and you see that
[1976.00 - 1978.80] in social media and you see that oh it's
[1977.64 - 1980.16] just all about herbs meanwhile the

[2259.96 - 2264.64] some more
[2261.00 - 2266.44] Foods celery can't say enough about it I
[2264.64 - 2267.96] you know what I can't even say enough
[2266.44 - 2271.24] about it it's not even just the
[2267.96 - 2272.88] Undiscovered subgroups of of of of
[2271.24 - 2275.36] mineral salts here's the thing about
[2272.88 - 2277.04] celery it's all the rage now because of
[2275.36 - 2278.76] us right cuz of spirit and medical
[2277.04 - 2280.56] medium and all that and everybody's
[2278.76 - 2282.56] drinking it worldwide and celery's
[2280.56 - 2285.20] running out Cel the celery Growers are
[2282.56 - 2287.32] freaking out all of that I get it you
[2285.20 - 2289.68] know I I I I brought that though to the
[2287.32 - 2290.84] world for a reason first of all science
[2289.68 - 2292.64] of research doesn't even know anything
[2290.84 - 2294.32] about celery that's why when a dietitian
[2292.64 - 2295.52] or something does this little does this
[2294.32 - 2297.08] little article or somewhere some
[2295.52 - 2298.28] conventional thing or alternative thing
[2297.08 - 2299.60] does an article and they bring somebody
[2298.28 - 2300.68] on and they're acting like a celery
[2299.60 - 2302.08] juice expert when they don't know
[2300.68 - 2303.56] anything about it they'll even say well
[2302.08 - 2305.28] there's not a lot out there in science
[2303.56 - 2307.84] and research about s of course there
[2305.28 - 2310.56] isn't of course there isn't about
[2307.84 - 2312.60] anything really about anything to do
[2310.56 - 2314.84] with anything that's health and relates
[2312.60 - 2317.20] unbelievable but here's the deal with
[2314.84 - 2319.48] celery it's these undiscovered subgroups
[2317.20 - 2322.44] sodium that's what it is they're called
[2319.48 - 2325.32] cluster salts I call them cluster salts
[2322.44 - 2327.56] I do all right I do because that's what
[2325.32 - 2329.40] they are and they then what they do is
[2327.56 - 2331.68] they enter into cell membranes and they
[2329.40 - 2335.08] inhibit growth of viruses they strip the
[2331.68 - 2336.68] membrane off of viruses that information
[2335.08 - 2339.68] will be available through through
[2336.68 - 2342.04] science and research 50 years from now
[2339.68 - 2345.24] how old will you be then but that's when
[2342.04 - 2347.52] it will be available so don't stop
[2345.24 - 2350.52] drinking celery juice just because this
[2347.52 - 2353.00] is the only source of information so far
[2350.52 - 2355.28] celery restores the liver's bio
[2353.00 - 2356.64] production I'm just giving you a little
[2355.28 - 2359.08] couple couple little things the

[2431.76 - 2434.36] you're bogging down the liver if you're
[2432.92 - 2437.56] vegan you're doing too many fats you're
[2434.36 - 2439.24] bogging down the liver um yeah you got
[2437.56 - 2440.56] to lower the fats I'm sorry about that
[2439.24 - 2441.92] but you have to if you're pale or you
[2440.56 - 2443.92] doing to you're worried too much about
[2441.92 - 2445.20] your proteins proteins protein proteins
[2443.92 - 2447.20] because you're suckered into the protein
[2445.20 - 2450.08] myth the protein law and theory that was
[2447.20 - 2452.00] created in 1933 to control people um
[2450.08 - 2453.40] same thing with you vegans too just tell
[2452.00 - 2455.88] your vegan friends you've been suckered
[2453.40 - 2457.96] into the protein myth so you guys are so
[2455.88 - 2459.52] anti conventional like you're anti I
[2457.96 - 2461.56] noticed who the vegans is what I really
[2459.52 - 2463.12] love and I love vegans I love them all I
[2461.56 - 2464.80] love everybody I love paleo people I
[2463.12 - 2466.04] love everybody I mean that's the whole
[2464.80 - 2467.20] point you got to love everybody you got
[2466.04 - 2468.68] to get them better and you got to get
[2467.20 - 2470.12] them healed you got to get them to get
[2468.68 - 2471.88] do the right things but I'm going to
[2470.12 - 2473.56] tell you something right now I've
[2471.88 - 2474.96] noticed about the vegans is they're so
[2473.56 - 2476.44] they're all of course they're against
[2474.96 - 2477.48] the whole animal thing they have of
[2476.44 - 2479.16] course they're against the animal
[2477.48 - 2480.64] killing thing all of that they're
[2479.16 - 2482.32] against all that and they're against
[2480.64 - 2485.24] they're against just the whole Animal
[2482.32 - 2486.84] product thing all that 100% totally with
[2485.24 - 2490.08] them I think you know I'm support them
[2486.84 - 2491.64] 100% but but yet they take the the they
[2490.08 - 2494.04] take that knowledge with them on their
[2491.64 - 2495.64] side they they they take protein with
[2494.04 - 2497.32] them that the protein law that was
[2495.64 - 2499.32] created for animal proteins to sucker
[2497.32 - 2500.96] people into thinking they need protein
[2499.32 - 2503.44] because of the deal the the contracts
[2500.96 - 2505.24] that were made in 1933 with the with
[2503.44 - 2508.04] with the how the world worked I talk
[2505.24 - 2509.80] about in this book by the way and so
[2508.04 - 2511.88] it's like the vegans are are literally
[2509.80 - 2514.20] they want to be separate from the animal
[2511.88 - 2516.68] uh protein people but yet they take the
[2514.20 - 2518.76] animal protein like law with them them
[2516.68 - 2521.08] and then they're all focused on protein
[2518.76 - 2522.56] it's actually really sad and and vegans
[2521.08 - 2524.20] don't like to be tricked they don't want
[2522.56 - 2525.68] to be tricked they they want to think
[2524.20 - 2526.84] they're the smartest people on the
[2525.68 - 2527.92] planet they don't want to be tricked and
[2526.84 - 2528.96] meanwhile they get tricked it just
[2527.92 - 2530.84] doesn't really make any sense so if
[2528.96 - 2532.28] you're vegan plant-based just try to
[2530.84 - 2534.28] figure that out and stop worrying about
[2532.28 - 2536.36] protein you know listen to my protein
[2534.28 - 2538.20] radio show listen to you know see see
[2536.36 - 2540.80] you know learn about it get the Liver

[2540.80 - 2543.84] you don't want to be tricked like that
[2542.44 - 2545.56] and the animal protein people are not
[2543.84 - 2547.00] supposed to be tricked like that either
[2545.56 - 2548.56] they if they want animal proteins you
[2547.00 - 2550.52] guys that's fine if that's what you want
[2548.56 - 2552.24] it's fine the point is is everybody
[2550.52 - 2554.28] needs to lower their fats stop thinking
[2552.24 - 2555.52] about protein because the protein thing
[2554.28 - 2557.00] just gets you in trouble so you end up
[2555.52 - 2560.04] eating more fat and you get yourself
[2557.00 - 2562.04] sick this is liver 101 right now okay

[2563.84 - 2568.84] we're all eating fats because we're all
[2565.88 - 2570.68] sucked into the protein law and it's sad
[2568.84 - 2572.36] that the plant-based people are still
[2570.68 - 2574.04] talking protein protein protein and
[2572.36 - 2575.56] they're still all all hung up on science
[2574.04 - 2577.08] and research everybody's battling
[2575.56 - 2579.16] everybody with science and research it's
[2577.08 - 2581.20] all bogus and all paid for so it's
[2579.16 - 2582.44] unbelievable paleo people are like there
[2581.20 - 2584.08] there's all the science of why this
[2582.44 - 2585.88] works you know this is what they did you
[2584.08 - 2587.72] know this is how man ate 10,000 years
[2585.88 - 2589.32] ago nobody knows what man ate 10,000
[2587.72 - 2590.92] years ago but here's here's all the
[2589.32 - 2592.84] science here's how it goes here's how it
[2590.92 - 2594.40] goes and then you got and then you got
[2592.84 - 2595.88] the plant-based people like no no no
[2594.40 - 2597.40] plant food here's the science behind it
[2595.88 - 2598.72] and this is what you got to do it's this
[2597.40 - 2600.56] this this and they're battling each
[2598.72 - 2602.72] other it's unbelievable and there all
[2600.56 - 2604.08] these hybrid diets are made from them
[2602.72 - 2605.56] and then but yet they're all hung up on
[2604.08 - 2608.24] this protein law and killing themselves
[2605.56 - 2610.12] on high diets without even knowing it
[2608.24 - 2612.36] even if they got better they're still
[2610.12 - 2613.68] going to get worse way way way down the
[2612.36 - 2615.20] road unless you learn how to heal the
[2613.68 - 2616.56] liver and lower the fats and learn how
[2615.20 - 2618.12] to do things for your liver and take
[2616.56 - 2620.72] care of yourself because yeah when
