notice i'm just letting you know all

395

that extra juice

396
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,360
is how you save money and the juicer

397
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
pays for itself and then pays for itself

398
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
and pays for itself and pays for itself

399
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,639
and that's what happens

400
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,399
that's just a fact of life of what this

401
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,800
juicer works this is how this juicer

402
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,519
works it's a medical device that pays

403
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,519
for itself and like i always said you

404
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,120

juicer as a medical device could be any

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,120
juicer right instead of being in a

407
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
hospital laid up on medical devices you

408
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,079

456
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
people around they can't keep celery in

457
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,480
stores

458
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,320

459
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
foods in all the health food stores

460
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
there's so much celery going there

461
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,519
they've never seen anything like it

462
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,880
before in our history

463
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,560
because millions and hundreds of

464
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,519
millions of people are drinking them but

465
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,199
there's closet drinkers and the media

466
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
doesn't want to talk about celery juice

467
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,279
anymore talked about it for five seconds

468
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
it doesn't want to talk about it anymore

469
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,240
because you don't want to talk about

470
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,400
something that brings somebody's health

471
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,559
back and their life back right you know

472
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
how corrupt everything is right where

473
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,799
they want to pretend you know

474
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
that things don't exist that get

475
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,400
people's lives back their health back

476
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,640
the system set up to make you sick so

477
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
remember that the system is built to

478
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,559
actually purposely make you sick

479
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,000
that's the plan

480
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,839
of the system

481
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,840
that's how they make everything go

482
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,080
around right that's how you do it

483
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,320
and celery juice is like this secret

484
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,000
weapon not secret weapon but they want

485
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,919
to keep it secret they don't want

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
anybody to know what it does and what

487
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
it's doing for people

488
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,120
but it's literally getting people's

489
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,280
lives back when nothing else could but

490
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
when that happens is you break the

491
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
system now

492
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,120
you end up breaking the system less

493
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
drugs

494
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,480
less drugs are being sold right less

495
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,280
drugs are being prescribed

496
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,840
you name it you know and the system just

497
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,600
starts to start losing money

498
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,080
and celery has the power to create that

499
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,520
to bring balance back right instead of

500
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,120
everybody just getting sicker out there

501
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,960

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,720

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,679
of the juicer go to megajuicers.com

531
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,080

533
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,039
and

534
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,520
you won't be disappointed the pulps dry

535
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,480
for a reason that's the way the juicer

536
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,280
is designed so you save money i used to

537
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,600
buy so much more celery to make

538
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,320
the juice right and then now i have to

539
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
buy less celery to make the juice

540
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,160
because it saves you money and then that

541
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,120
adds up and then each month you're like

542
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,440
whoa

543
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
i just made 50 bucks i just made 100

544
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320

545
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,799
each month it's like whoa just another

546
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,559
100 another 200 you know because next

547
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,320
thing you know juicer paid for itself

548
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,559
juicer paid for itself over and over

549
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,080
again it's really cool it's really cool

550
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,840

554
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,679
when you talk to family and friends and

555
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,640
people you know

556
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280

561
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,919
they're doing and you'll find two or

562
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,320

and that's why i like saving money with

565
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,159
something that's you know saving me

566
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,679
money so food prices all food prices are

567
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,000
going up

568
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
that's what's happening right

569
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,640
so food prices are going up and the next

570
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,799
year they're going to go up more

571
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,679
so what i like about this juicer is it's

572
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,320
saving me money and so that helps battle

573
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,799
that whole food price going up thing

574
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,880
so that's what's cool about it

575
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,640
when people are on two vices or three

576
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,480
vices which is two addictions three

577
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,880
addictions four addictions right

578
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
and once you become

579
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
knowledgeable

580
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,520
really knowledgeable

581
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,880
about addictions you can pick them off

582
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,400
you can pick them off what you're

583
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
knowledgeable about because a lot of

584
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,440
people they're not knowledgeable they

585
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
don't know

586
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,240
that too much fat in the diet's an

587
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,559
actual addiction because here's how it

588
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,559
works

589
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,520
the more fat you eat

590
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,000
the more adrenaline gets released

591
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,840
adrenaline's your blood thinner for fat

592
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,520
you're consuming

593
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
you think you're smart

594
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,400
you're eating a lot of nut butters

595
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,840
instead

596
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,000
maybe you're plant-based you're eating

597
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,679
lots of avocado oils and nut butters and

598
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,840
you think you beat the the processed

599
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,840
food greasy fried food

600
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,720
animal protein world you think you beat

601
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
it

602
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
but you didn't

603
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,400
you didn't

604
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
because if you keep on pounding the fat

605
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,840
doesn't matter what it is it could be

606
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,440
the healthy fats

607
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,360
i'm not saying you don't have to eat

608
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,200
like never to eat them no

609
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,840
you think you beat the system but you

610
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,360
didn't beat it you didn't beat the fat

611
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,760
i never ever make fun of someone who's

612
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,280

753
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,320
is this

754
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,640
place

755
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,559
where purposeful evil happens right it's

756
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,480
on purpose you think it's not you think

757
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,559
it's just stupid people making mistakes

758
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
meaning like industries and stuff you

759
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,600
think they're just making mistakes

760
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,200
no

761
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,520
it's on purpose

762
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
it's what makes it all go around you

763
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,279

765
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,360
they want you sick

766
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,440
and they want you gone

767
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,559
they want both

768
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,440
that's

769
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,640
what the darkness on this planet wants

770
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,840
and

771
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,360
if we don't get wise to some of it and

772
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,520

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,720
then how do you protect yourself

774
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,240

793
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,039
definitely a lot

794
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,799

okay

812
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,559
there isn't two metal gears in here

813
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,480
grinding against each other this is a

814
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,039
cold pressed juicer without the two

815
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,080
metal gears grinding against each other

816
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,480
okay keep that in mind right this isn't

817
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,600
the centrifuge with all that metal

818
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,120
flinging around too okay

819
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,080
keep that in mind

820
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,919
so

821
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,600
i get it there's a lot of juicer

822
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,840
companies out there and they're like our

823
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,840
cold pressed juicer it's historically

824
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200

825
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,799
good glad you love getting all that

826
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,399
metal in you

827
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,799
because you got the metal gears rubbing

828
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,960
against each other this one doesn't

829
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,559
important to know easy to clean pull

830
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
this off boom put it in the sink you

831
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,840

832
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,679
and then you're good right

833
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,559
so um anyway it comes with two free

834
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,360
glass bottles too not just the book

835
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,799
and the food price is going up the food

836
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,760
price is going up

837
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,320
this is gonna save people money okay

838
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,960
so talk about what the addictions do and

839
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,320
how it works your brain

840
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,240
starts to get used to the high

841
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,039
the addictive high

842
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
it's

843
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,559
one joint doesn't do it anymore

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,640
one joint won't do it anymore right

845
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,880
a little bit of ayahuasca won't do it

846
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,120
anymore a tiny bit of shrooms won't do

847
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,159
it anymore you need more

848
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,039
you don't get the same experience

849
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,880
a little bit of cbd cbd oil and i'm not

850
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,960
ranking on cbd oil if you're somebody

851
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,799
uses it and you're somebody that uses

852
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,919
pot or somebody that uses i know they're

853
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,679
two different things unless you've got

854
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
thc in the cbd oil but what i'm trying

855
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,799
to tell you is

856
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,960
if you're somebody on any of this stuff

857
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,120
alcohol if you're somebody eating fast

858
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,200
food every day i'm not

859
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
shaming you

860
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,640
i'm on your side

861
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,799
i'm on your side

862
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,080
okay 100

863
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,080
i don't know what it's like to be in

864
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
your shoes possibly right

865
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,559
whatever's happened in your life isn't

866
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,679
what happened in my life

867
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,360
look

868
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,640
you know look at people chronic illness

869
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,320
nobody knows what it's like to be in

870
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,480
their shoe

871
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,640
uh-uh nobody knows what it's like to

872
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,519
feel what their shoe size is like

873
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,039
okay

874
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,480
so with somebody with chronic illness

875
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,799
and and everything they've gone through

876
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,880
with chronic illness all right

877
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,080
so and i get that

878
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,000
what i'm saying is the high isn't enough

879
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,440
that's why people who drink alcohol end

880
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,799
up drinking a little bit more alcohol

881
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,320
and a little bit more at some time in

882
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,919
the life of it a little bit more and

883
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,279
people who start out smoking pot end up

884
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,360
smoking a little bit more and a little

885
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,200
bit more people who do fast food end up

886
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,279
that's not enough i want to order this

887
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,640
now and this down this now now i want to

888
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,799
go to this restaurant and try that

889
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,559
gastro abomination now i want to go to

890
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,799
this restaurant and try that you know

891
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,799
abomination right because there's

892
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,679
there's a high what about the foodie

893
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,559
highs oh i'm a foodie

894
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,559
i'm a foodie

895
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,679
you know i travel around the restaurants

896
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,159
and i'm a foodie you know i like to try

897
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,919
this restaurant that restaurant because

898
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,960
there's this high and you can't get

899
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,760
enough

900
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,200
right everything because the brain

901
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,480
ends up

902
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,679
maxim it ends up maxing out where you

903
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,440
have to trump it you have to ride over

904
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,760
that

905
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,840
you have to ride over that

906
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,600
then it's not enough

907
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,440
a little piece of chocolate once a

908
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
week's not enough you need more

909
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,360
chocolate now and then more chocolate

910
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,360
and you need a quarter of a bar then you

911
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,200
need a quarter of a bar every single day

912
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,440
until something inside of you says oh

913
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,840
[ __ ] oh [ __ ] i better stop eating two

914
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,919
chocolate bars a

915
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,480
day i better stop i better stop you know

916
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
eating two chocolate bars a day

917
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
right

918
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,440
because

919
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,559
something inside here in the brain

920
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
here's how the brain works

921
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,360
neurotransmitter chemicals

922
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
neurotransmitters neurons and everything

923
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,039
else glial cells the brain works where

924
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,679
you

925
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,120
you have to keep on upping

926
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,960
the ante

927
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,360
to get a feeling like you used to feel

928
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,880
you have to keep on upping it

929
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,279
right it's people there's people that

930
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,640
are addicted to fighting

931
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,559
right they're addicted to fighting and

932
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,559
they start yelling and have an argument

933
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,240
that ain't enough

934
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,559
the next week they start yelling and

935
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,919
having a bigger argument the next week

936
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,399
they start yelling and having now

937
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,880
they're slamming the doors running out

938
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,480
of the house running out of the office

939
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,799
now they're they're they're now they're

940
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,279
having a bigger coral right

941
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,240
it becomes addictive where adrenaline

942
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,159
surge occurs

943
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,600
and then the depression that hits

944
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
afterwards

945
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,760
after those fights

946
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,600
it's all part of the addiction can get

947
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,399
you trapped in there

948
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
okay same thing when you're bulimic and

949
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,080
you're anorexic bulimic and you're

950
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,399
throwing up your food

951
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,320
it becomes addictive the the there's an

952
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,159
addiction quality to it

953
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
if someone had emotional abuse and it

954
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,679
made them bulimic because they had

955
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,480
severe emotional abuse right happened to

956
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,080
them and they became bulimic right

957
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,039
and they're throwing up everything they

958
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,039
eat

959
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,039
they start out just throwing up once

960
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,399
okay

961
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,480
and then they've got a high off of it

962
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
because when you throw up

963
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,040
force yourself to throw up

964
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:14,000
your adrenals explode

965
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,000
they explode

966
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,679
and then whoa my high is coming down my

967
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,879
high's coming down throw up again boom

968
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,040
throw up again

969
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,079
they're self-medicating

970
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,800
somebody with bulimia self-medicating

971
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,000
and their adrenals explode again

972
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,520
i'm gonna go to this fast food

973
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
restaurant and eat this big gastric

974
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
abomination your adrenals start to

975
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,839
explode

976
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,800
i'm going to get i'm going to get on my

977
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,639
my uh my amphetamine

978
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,119
from my black market amphetamine or my

979
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,560
prescribed doctor's amphetamine you guys

980
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,879
give me a thumbs up if you get a chance

981
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,879
to before i forget if you don't like the

982
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,399
video give me a thumbs up anyway i don't

983
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,320
know

984
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,040
if you like the video give me a thumbs

985
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
up

986
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,200
okay

987
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,880
so

988
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,560
that's what happens right so back to the

989
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,680
bulimia

990
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,320
so

991
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
one throw up's not enough

992
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,359
the brain

993
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,160
plateaus

994
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,880
now it's throwing up once a day instead

995
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,440
of once a week

996
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,320
but that adrenaline high

997
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,119
now you're throwing up every day

998
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,520
now you're addicted

999
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,200
same thing with an anorexia starving

1000
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,200
yourself

1001
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,720
the adrenals when you starve yourself

1002
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,640
everybody's that's on an intermittent

1003
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,320
fasting diet

1004
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,800
right

1005
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,880
is on a type of anorexic diet did you

1006
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,560
know that

1007
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,440
when you don't when you withhold from

1008
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,440
food all day purposely

1009
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,520
right

1010
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,800
when you do that all day your adrenals

1011
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,800
are exploding all day long

1012
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,320
when someone who's anorexic

1013
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,800
right that doesn't want to eat and it

1014
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,359
becomes such a problem their adrenals

1015
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,680
are exploding giving them high

1016
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,920
it fills in for missing blood sugar so

1017
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,000
i'm on an intermittent fasting diet not

1018
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
eating anything but coffee and caffeine

1019
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,480
and then i'll have a big fat meal at

1020
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,400
night um yeah i'm slimming down nice

1021
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,640
from it you're just living off of

1022
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,320
adrenaline and eventually

1023
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,000
that will run out you'll burn those

1024
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,280
adrenals out something will happen down

1025
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,440
the road right

1026
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
someone who's anorexic is withholding

1027
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,240
from food because they have some

1028
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,920
emotional abuse that happened to them

1029
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,599
something terrible happened to them or

1030
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,960
like i said toxic heavy metals in the

1031
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,800
brain there's a reason why they're

1032
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,640
anorexic and they don't want to eat but

1033
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,560
that they're living off of adrenaline

1034
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,640
from not eating and

1035
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,880
eventually

1036
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,680
it's not enough

1037
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,760
so you stop eating longer

1038
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,280
you stop eating longer

1039
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,640
you want more adrenaline high

1040
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,160
and the opposite can happen when you're

1041
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,040
eating all that fast food and that

1042
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,800
grease

1043
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,560
you want the adrenaline high so you eat

1044
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,119
more of it

1045
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,480
i'm gonna have pizza every night

1046
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,640
oh no i'll have something else this

1047
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,920
night

1048
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,400
addictions

1049
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,839
do this right where

1050
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,119
your brain

1051
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,520
maxes

1052
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,760
and then you have to override and

1053
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,880
override and try to get the same feeling

1054
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,560
again but go further and further

1055
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,160
right how many people i've talked to

1056
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,520
over the years you're going to start out

1057
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,440
smoking a little bit of pot on the

1058
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,960
weekends

1059
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
then they needed a lot of pot on the

1060
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,000
weekends

1061
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,400
and then they needed

1062
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,800
lots of marijuana all week long and then

1063
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,640
they smoked it three times a day

1064
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,560
and their wife was like get the hell out

1065
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,720
of here i'm divorcing you

1066
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,520
how many friends how many have i seen

1067
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,599
that to do that right i've seen i can't

1068
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,480
tell you can't count how many over the

1069
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,599
years

1070
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,920
and and because you you max out and you

1071
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,599
have to override

1072
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
same thing with chocolate

1073
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,760
a little square once a week

1074
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,440
you need three squares

1075
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,560
now you're gonna need ten squares or

1076
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,480
you're gonna need two chocolate bars

1077
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,280
then you're gonna eat in your smoothies

1078
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,160
same with medications amphetamines

1079
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,680
right

1080
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,440
a little bit ain't enough why do you

1081
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,119
think all the college students are

1082
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,640
looking in the black market in their

1083
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,440
prestigious schools they go around the

1084
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,200
corner and they buy it right there

1085
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,960
no one says anything

1086
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,000
it's possible it's practically passed

1087
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,440
out for free

1088
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,880
on campuses

1089
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,800
because the prescribed dose isn't enough

1090
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,480
for all the students

1091
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,680
so you need that prescribed dose from

1092
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,119
the doctor and then they need a whole

1093
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,040
bunch more because you you need to

1094
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,640
override to get the feeling you need

1095
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,520
again same with alcohol

1096
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,520
same with alcohol

1097
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,920
but you think they'd be passing out

1098
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,119
celery juice passing that around through

1099
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,800
all the prestigious universities no

1100
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,640
you think they'd be passing all the

1101
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,440
celery juice around in the medical

1102
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,000
universities no of course not

1103
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,079
passing around drugs you think you think

1104
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
they'd be passing on celery juice

1105
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,720
everywhere

1106
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,000
no

1107
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,240
because nobody wants to fix anything

1108
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,640
nobody wants to fix anything so it's up

1109
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,960
to us how we empower ourselves to take

1110
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,119
control over our lives you know

1111
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,800
and and it's up to us to do that for

1112
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,440
ourselves

1113
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,760
because the system is not going to teach

1114
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
it's just going to destroy

1115
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,800
that's what it does

1116
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,720
the celery juice is one powerful tool

1117
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,040
that's what it is

1118
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,839
it's one powerful tool to really move

1119
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,520
the needle it's what it's about

1120
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,440
it's about

1121
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,359

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
five years

1131
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,280
they're gonna vampire blood out of you

1132
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,720
guys like you've never seen before with

1133
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,079
your aches and pains the doctor is going

1134
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,280
to be like no let's get more blood work

1135
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,800
you know let's get more blood work let's

1136
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,359
get 12 more vials let's get 10 more

1137
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,920
vials and all that blood

1138
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,599
is going to be carried away someplace

1139
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,440
carried away

1140
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,440
and then you know

1141
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
bottom line is

1142
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,079
they're going to drain everybody make

1143
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,079
them more deficient make them more

1144
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,920
deficient and people are ready to fish

1145
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,359
it they're going to lose their glucose

1146
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,480
the glucose deficiencies they're going

1147
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,839
to get

1148
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,800
and you know

1149
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,800
what news flash

1150
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,560
i love how they say your brain's made

1151
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,720
out of all fat it's not

1152
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,359
it's made out of storage stored like

1153
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,359
glycogen okay glucose

1154
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,200
stored glycogen

1155
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,200
without glucose your brain dies within

1156
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,960
five seconds

1157
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
five seconds

1158
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,359
ten seconds

1159
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,280
for sure five seconds it starts to die

1160
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,480
right your brain has traces of fats all

1161
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,640
through it

1162
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,720
but your brain's made mostly out of

1163
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,160
glycogen that's what the tissues made

1164
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,359
out of right

1165
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,760
so

1166
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,640
what's happening here now with everybody

1167
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
right

1168
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,880
is they're teaching people to be afraid

1169
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,640
of sugar afraid of sugar

1170
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,000
the critical clean carbohydrates i've

1171
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,000
talked about that's medical medium

1172
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,720
information the potatoes and the sweet

1173
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,520
potatoes and the fruits right

1174
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,480
and even peas and and

1175
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,800
steamed

1176
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,119
sweet potatoes and regular potatoes and

1177
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,480
purple potatoes really good for people

1178
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,480
for bringing the brain back

1179
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,160
what happens is that when they study the

1180
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,720
human brain they study the human brain

1181
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,040
with overweight cadavers they cut them

1182
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,760
open

1183
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,359
and their brain had fat in it like a

1184
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,599
chicken does

1185
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,599
okay

1186
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,960
when you have chicken you see all that

1187
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
fat in the chicken you guys ever see

1188
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,520
that when someone puts a big nice piece

1189
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,319
of chicken on your plate right and you

1190
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,000
see all that fat that yellow stringy fat

1191
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,440
all through the chicken

1192
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,200
right because they fatten the chickens

1193
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,800
up and they fatten them up so you guys

1194
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,520
have your chicken right

1195
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,200
well the same thing happens to our brain

1196
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,960
right

1197
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,119
we get a lot of fat in the brain it

1198
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
builds up it shouldn't be in there

1199
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,800
you get fat all around it the brain

1200
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
starts shrinking and then more fat

1201
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
starts to show up the brain starts

1202
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,920
shrinking right

1203
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,319
and

1204
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,319
and that's part of how we basically lose

1205
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,520
ourselves and get sick throughout the

1206
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,520
years

1207
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,400
so that's important to know too that's

1208
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,880
part of it we lose the gluck we lose the

1209
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,040
glucose the glycogen reserve our brain

1210
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,880
starts to shrink over time

1211
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
and

1212
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,359
that's important to know

1213
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,200
so

1214
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,960
on that note when i was talking about

1215
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,400
addictions in fact some of you and i'm

1216
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,839
going back to this for a reason because

1217
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,520
some of you pray like fats are good for

1218
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,480
you you need fats brains made out of

1219
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,800
fats

1220
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,800
right

1221
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
so the brain study they did for how much

1222
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,839
fats in your brain

1223
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,760
saw an overweight cadaver

1224
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,839
with additional fat that shouldn't have

1225
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,520
been surrounded around the brain

1226
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
just like you get fat around your liver

1227
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,560
and you get a fatty liver people get a

1228
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,079
fatty brain

1229
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,640
important to know

1230
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,800
and it had it in in it around it twisted

1231
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,359
in it too fat that's not supposed to be

1232
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,760
in there bad fat that's not supposed to

1233
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,920
be wrapped around your brain when you

1234
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,240
look at a cadaver

1235
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,800
that that's not overweight the

1236
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,880
percentage of fat in the brain is cut in

1237
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,760
half

1238
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,400
and then you look at a healthier cadaver

1239
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,000
the percentage is even lower

1240
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,839
and lower

1241
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,240
and that's how it works when they cut

1242
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,040
open a brain of somebody who's 90 years

1243
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,599
old and is still lean after all those

1244
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,280
years and didn't consume a really high

1245
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
fat diet and they cut open that

1246
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,800
cadaver's brain there's very little fat

1247
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,079
in the brain

1248
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,880
right they cut open a 50 year old

1249
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,440
that's

1250
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,880
pounds and pounds overweight

1251
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
where do you think all that fat goes

1252
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,520
it's just in the skin it's just under

1253
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,839
the skin is that where all the fat goes

1254
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,440
it's wrapped in and around the organs

1255
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,520
liver the spleen

1256
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,280
wrapped around the colon wrapped around

1257
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,280
the brain

1258
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,640
and so i know it's talking about fats

1259
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,079
being addicted and we're looking for the

1260
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,520
greasy foods and then we're looking for

1261
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,800
healthy fats because that's what we want

1262
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,560
to eat all the time but we have to

1263
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,800
remember

1264
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,800
that you got to lower those fats

1265
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,720
so you don't kill your adrenals and help

1266
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,319
to break the addiction so you can learn

1267
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,160
about that information on many of the

1268
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,920
lives i've done and everything guys i'm

and uh we'll talk a little bit more

1272
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,520
