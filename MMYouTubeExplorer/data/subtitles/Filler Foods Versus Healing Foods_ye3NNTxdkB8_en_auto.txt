[173.60 - 179.28] a little bit of basil
[176.72 - 182.96] but it's a filler
[179.28 - 184.56] there's so much filler going on
[182.96 - 186.64] that's what people
[184.56 - 188.32] don't understand
[186.64 - 191.60] is there so much
[188.32 - 194.08] filler going on out there and that's

[220.48 - 224.16] they're a medicinal food it's not a
[222.48 - 227.20] filler
[224.16 - 229.44] too many beans
[227.20 - 231.28] are a filler
[229.44 - 234.64] doesn't mean they're bad
[231.28 - 236.64] doesn't mean beans are bad
[234.64 - 238.64] ah no it's just that it's a lot of
[236.64 - 240.96] filler you see how it works you guys

[276.16 - 280.56] healing foods avocado can become a
[278.64 - 281.92] filler but it's still it's it's in this
[280.56 - 283.44] list over here because it's still
[281.92 - 285.92] healing
[283.44 - 289.28] avocados more healing
[285.92 - 289.28] than a piece of chicken
[289.76 - 294.88] chicken is a filler
[293.28 - 296.64] not the worst thing to eat if you're a
[294.88 - 298.48] chicken eater
[296.64 - 300.16] meaning like if that's what you eat i'm
[298.48 - 302.00] not gonna shame you

[340.56 - 343.36] end sure
[341.60 - 345.76] that'll clog up your heart that's the
[343.36 - 348.32] heart attack butter
[345.76 - 350.88] the heart attack that's it butter is
[348.32 - 352.72] that's heart attack and a stick

[352.72 - 356.16] tell friends i'll be like oh you're
[354.48 - 358.08] having a heart attack in a stand on a
[356.16 - 359.76] stick
[358.08 - 362.00] heart attacking a stick
[359.76 - 363.20] you're having a heart attack stick
[362.00 - 364.80] right that's what you're doing no i'm
[363.20 - 366.08] only how this is organic butter it's
[364.80 - 367.92] grass-fed butter i'm only going to have
[366.08 - 369.20] a little here i'm going to spread it on
[367.92 - 371.84] this if you're just having your heart
[369.20 - 374.88] attack stick
[371.84 - 377.28] not going to judge you though no way
[374.88 - 377.28] ever
[377.60 - 380.96] right
[379.28 - 383.60] salmon
[380.96 - 385.84] it's a filler
[383.60 - 389.44] you want to eat salmon that's okay
[385.84 - 392.24] you're sick you're taking space
[389.44 - 394.80] away from other things that will heal
[392.24 - 397.92] you
[394.80 - 400.80] you love your salmon
[397.92 - 402.96] but it's a filler
[400.80 - 404.56] there isn't fillers in it
[402.96 - 406.40] you can get wild caught salmon there's
[404.56 - 409.04] no fillers in it but it's a filler
[406.40 - 410.56] itself you see how it works you guys
[409.04 - 412.32] that's how it works this is important to
[410.56 - 413.84] know
[412.32 - 416.44] salmon
[413.84 - 420.00] is not anti-viral anti-bacterial
[416.44 - 422.88] anti-fungal anti-mold anti-yeast see
[420.00 - 424.80] it's a filler
[422.88 - 425.92] right you can have grass-fed beef if
[424.80 - 427.44] you're somebody that loves grass-fed
[425.92 - 430.96] beef because medical medium is an
[427.44 - 433.60] anti-animal protein medical medium is an
[430.96 - 435.28] anti-plant
[433.60 - 437.88] diet
[435.28 - 440.56] medical medium's not anti-vegan diet
[437.88 - 443.04] anti-vegetarian diet anti-animal protein
[440.56 - 445.92] diet now but keep in mind
[443.04 - 448.00] if you're gonna be eating your meat it's
[445.92 - 450.16] not anti-viral anti-bacterial
[448.00 - 452.24] anti-fungal anti-yeast anti-whatever
[450.16 - 453.68] anti-whatever it's not
[452.24 - 455.60] it's not
[453.68 - 457.44] it's a filler
[455.60 - 458.88] it's a filler
[457.44 - 460.24] it doesn't mean
[458.88 - 462.24] the meat
[460.24 - 464.88] is going to
[462.24 - 466.96] feed everything bad inside of you i
[464.88 - 471.60] never said that someone wants the animal
[466.96 - 471.60] protein i would say lower the amount
[471.92 - 474.48] but it's
[473.36 - 476.48] a filler
[474.48 - 478.72] the lower says what's a filler
[476.48 - 480.72] these are fillers that take up space
[478.72 - 482.56] very good question dolores thank you
[480.72 - 485.36] very good question these are fillers
[482.56 - 488.32] that take up space in our diet and stop
[485.36 - 489.68] us from making room for what making room
[488.32 - 493.12] for what
[489.68 - 496.56] making room for more leafy greens more
[493.12 - 497.52] asparagus more brussels sprouts more
[496.56 - 500.16] kale
[497.52 - 501.92] more squash more papayas right there
[500.16 - 503.36] more bananas right there more oranges
[501.92 - 505.04] right there more zucchinis more
[503.36 - 507.12] everything
[505.04 - 508.88] right these are just some things
[507.12 - 511.36] i got right here
[508.88 - 514.80] so we take seaweed hero exactly less
[511.36 - 517.04] filling we take up space
[514.80 - 518.32] right you want your chicken you want
[517.04 - 520.24] your chicken
[518.32 - 521.76] okay people want their chicken they want
[520.24 - 523.52] to eat it too they want to eat the cake
[521.76 - 524.96] too they want their chicken and eat it
[523.52 - 527.28] too they want their meat they want to
[524.96 - 528.80] eat it too they want their fish they
[527.28 - 530.32] want to eat it too they want their
[528.80 - 532.48] butter they want to eat the butter's
[530.32 - 536.40] different that's just a heart attack on
[532.48 - 536.40] a stick that feeds bugs
[537.60 - 540.48] let's talk about plant-based for a
[539.12 - 542.00] second talking about vegans and
[540.48 - 545.04] plant-based for a second so this is
[542.00 - 546.56] important i just want to say uh to kim
[545.04 - 548.80] kim on
[546.56 - 549.68] rumble hi kim marie
[548.80 - 552.56] right
[549.68 - 555.28] and um i could see your comments
[552.56 - 557.28] on rumble too
[555.28 - 559.84] plant-based you could be plant-based and
[557.28 - 562.08] still have fillers everywhere guess what
[559.84 - 563.92] you can be plant-based and have too many
[562.08 - 566.96] avocados
[563.92 - 571.04] and yes they're healthier
[566.96 - 575.76] they offer more than other fillers
[571.04 - 580.16] avocados offer more than meat filler
[575.76 - 582.16] avocado offers more than salmon
[580.16 - 583.44] if you're wondering how that lemon stays
[582.16 - 587.36] on there like that's because it's
[583.44 - 587.36] obviously a prop piece of salmon
[587.44 - 592.88] avocados
[589.68 - 595.12] have more in them as a filler than
[592.88 - 597.12] chicken but you can still play the
[595.12 - 599.36] filler game with too much avocado and
[597.12 - 601.68] too much nuts and seeds
[599.36 - 603.92] you can eat as a plant-based person lots
[601.68 - 606.00] of nuts lots of seeds you hear this guys
[603.92 - 608.80] listen lots of nuts lots of nut butters
[606.00 - 610.64] lots of seeds and yeah there's some
[608.80 - 612.48] healing properties in nuts and there's
[610.64 - 614.96] some healing properties in seeds but it
[612.48 - 616.88] still takes too much space and can still
[614.96 - 618.88] make it so a vegan person a plant-based
[616.88 - 621.44] person can't heal
[618.88 - 622.96] because it becomes a filler it becomes a
[621.44 - 625.12] filler
[622.96 - 628.64] and you can be a vegan and eat too many
[625.12 - 631.28] beans too much rice
[628.64 - 632.72] because those are fillers
[631.28 - 634.56] oatmeal
[632.72 - 636.00] oatmeal for both the animal protein
[634.56 - 637.60] people and the plant-based people i'm
[636.00 - 639.76] just telling you now or the vegans and
[637.60 - 643.68] the animal protein people oatmeal
[639.76 - 645.52] is a safe grain to eat
[643.68 - 648.16] but it's a filler
[645.52 - 651.44] this is such an important topic
[648.16 - 654.32] it's a filler you guys
[651.44 - 654.32] that's what it is
[654.40 - 659.28] you can tank on some oatmeal every day
[657.12 - 661.76] but it's not enough healing properties
[659.28 - 664.16] in oatmeal oatmeal is not antiviral
[661.76 - 667.20] antibacterial anti-fungal anti-yeast
[664.16 - 669.76] anti-everything that's making you sick
[667.20 - 674.32] oatmeal doesn't cleanse the poisons and
[669.76 - 676.00] toxins out of your liver and body
[674.32 - 678.68] meat
[676.00 - 682.08] is not antiviral
[678.68 - 685.92] antibacterial anti fungal anti yeast and
[682.08 - 688.00] meat can't cleanse metals and stuff
[685.92 - 690.96] that's inside your liver and your body
[688.00 - 693.92] it can't cleanse it out
[690.96 - 696.56] salmon is not antiviral anti and
[693.92 - 699.92] antifungal anti yeast antibacterial and
[696.56 - 702.08] it can't cleanse the poison out of your
[699.92 - 704.80] body it can't pull the poison out of
[702.08 - 706.08] your body you see how it goes
[704.80 - 708.96] it can't
[706.08 - 711.20] aj good to see you

[732.48 - 737.68] animal attack

[930.24 - 932.72] morning
[932.80 - 937.60] do something right that takes place of
[935.20 - 940.40] the fillers but does something for you
[937.60 - 942.88] don't you want it working for you don't
[940.40 - 944.32] you want what you're doing working for
[942.88 - 946.32] you you guys

[950.40 - 954.08] and so when everybody's doing too much
[952.32 - 955.44] filler doesn't mean you're not allowed a
[954.08 - 957.28] piece of meat if you're an animal
[955.44 - 958.64] protein person doesn't mean you're not
[957.28 - 960.08] allowed a piece of salmon if you're an
[958.64 - 961.68] animal protein person or a piece of
[960.08 - 964.88] chicken it doesn't mean you're not
[961.68 - 966.32] allowed doesn't mean as as a plant-based
[964.88 - 967.84] person you're not allowed all those nuts
[966.32 - 970.08] and seeds you're not allowed some
[967.84 - 972.00] avocados you're not allowed all that it
[970.08 - 974.88] just means
[972.00 - 974.88] you gotta work
[974.96 - 982.28] with the miracles that the planet has
[979.04 - 982.28] and offers
[982.64 - 987.84] i recommend holding off those animal
[985.44 - 989.52] proteins till the end of the day till
[987.84 - 992.16] dinner time if you're an animal protein
[989.52 - 994.32] person you wait to the end of the day so
[992.16 - 996.08] you don't take up your day with too many
[994.32 - 997.68] fillers and then at night if you do your
[996.08 - 1000.40] animal protein at night that's when you
[997.68 - 1000.40] did a filler
[1000.64 - 1004.48] and i recommend if you're anna if you're
[1002.56 - 1007.12] plant-based if you're vegan and you're
[1004.48 - 1009.60] plant-based i recommend
[1007.12 - 1011.36] you hold off on a lot of the grains and
[1009.60 - 1013.92] a lot of the oatmeal a little bit maybe
[1011.36 - 1016.08] you do those two to the end of the day
[1013.92 - 1017.28] but you you replaced it in the morning
[1016.08 - 1019.44] with
[1017.28 - 1021.36] with your smoothies and you got your
[1019.44 - 1023.12] banana smoothies you got all that in
[1021.36 - 1024.48] there

[1101.52 - 1106.64] i'm telling you guys
[1104.24 - 1108.32] you gotta kind of adjust it to make room
[1106.64 - 1110.48] for the foods that are going to heal and
[1108.32 - 1112.40] help you and turn your life around and
[1110.48 - 1114.16] not get caught up in too many of the
[1112.40 - 1116.32] fillers because if you get caught up in
[1114.16 - 1118.88] too many into too many of the fillers
[1116.32 - 1121.04] you pay the price down the road either
[1118.88 - 1124.32] you don't heal or you never heal
[1121.04 - 1126.16] completely or you get sicker in some way
[1124.32 - 1128.96] and that's what happens and no one
[1126.16 - 1131.04] really understands this
[1128.96 - 1133.68] this isn't the channel of oh it's either
[1131.04 - 1136.64] animal protein or plant-based
[1133.68 - 1139.04] no this is the channel of
[1136.64 - 1141.36] reason this is the channel of making
[1139.04 - 1143.84] sure you have every opportunity to heal
[1141.36 - 1145.44] in any way possible and taking advantage
[1143.84 - 1147.60] of the opportunities here on the planet
[1145.44 - 1152.16] because you gotta eat
[1147.60 - 1155.20] you gotta eat so we can do things
[1152.16 - 1158.24] we can do things with our foods
[1155.20 - 1162.48] that can change our lives we get into

[1240.08 - 1244.32] do
[1240.96 - 1246.64] saying hi to selfie sage out there

[1260.16 - 1264.64] talking about fillers you know what i
[1262.32 - 1266.88] mean the bad stuff additives and fillers
[1264.64 - 1269.76] we're talking about fillers that you're
[1266.88 - 1271.76] adding into your diet every day that's
[1269.76 - 1273.44] stopping you from healing stopping you
[1271.76 - 1275.28] from changing your life stopping you
[1273.44 - 1277.84] from reversing the conditions and the
[1275.28 - 1280.16] symptoms and stopping you from cleansing
[1277.84 - 1281.36] and healing cleansing and healing the
[1280.16 - 1283.36] body
[1281.36 - 1286.80] beverly grafts hubert said i found out
[1283.36 - 1289.12] fillers dry me out morning lemon water
[1286.80 - 1290.80] celery juice heavy metal detox smoothie
[1289.12 - 1292.64] makes such a difference in the morning i
[1290.80 - 1294.96] didn't realize i was so dehydrated
[1292.64 - 1297.12] beverly it's easy i'm so glad you're
[1294.96 - 1300.16] here thank you for the comment it's easy
[1297.12 - 1301.44] to fill up on fillers
[1300.16 - 1304.72] so easy
[1301.44 - 1306.80] eggs in the morning filler an egg's not
[1304.72 - 1309.12] going to reverse a condition an egg is
[1306.80 - 1313.52] not going to heal you you guys have to
[1309.12 - 1315.84] understand this an egg doesn't heal you
[1313.52 - 1317.36] th this is critical information for
[1315.84 - 1320.16] people out there that are trying to heal
[1317.36 - 1322.00] and get their lives back an egg doesn't
[1320.16 - 1323.92] heal you
[1322.00 - 1328.00] at all
[1323.92 - 1332.16] and red onion helps you heal an egg
[1328.00 - 1334.32] helps you get sick it doesn't heal you
[1332.16 - 1336.56] i'd rather have you eat avocados than
[1334.32 - 1338.24] eggs any day but like i said if you're
[1336.56 - 1340.64] plant-based you could be eating way too
[1338.24 - 1342.24] much avocado then it becomes a filler
[1340.64 - 1343.84] because avocado does have healing
[1342.24 - 1345.12] properties so i like it better than a
[1343.84 - 1347.28] lot of things
[1345.12 - 1349.76] but when you dominate your diet with
[1347.28 - 1351.84] avocados all the time it doesn't mean
[1349.76 - 1354.00] we're going to be actually reversing a
[1351.84 - 1356.48] condition so when we have our avocado
[1354.00 - 1357.76] toast on gluten-free bread that's great
[1356.48 - 1360.16] and there's some healthy things in
[1357.76 - 1362.08] avocado but it's not enough to reverse
[1360.16 - 1363.84] our condition and turn our lives around
[1362.08 - 1365.52] it becomes a filler
[1363.84 - 1368.48] becomes a filler
[1365.52 - 1371.20] an orange is not a filler you make room
[1368.48 - 1373.76] for some oranges you're making room the
[1371.20 - 1375.84] minute you take away all those fillers
[1373.76 - 1378.16] the minute you take away those right
[1375.84 - 1378.16] there
[1378.40 - 1382.80] you just open the door
[1380.64 - 1384.96] for something to come in
[1382.80 - 1387.36] that can turn your life around you just
[1384.96 - 1390.56] open the door to the magic of healing
[1387.36 - 1393.04] you just open the door to the angelic
[1390.56 - 1396.48] healing powers that are around you
[1393.04 - 1397.52] angels wanting you to heal
[1396.48 - 1399.36] however
[1397.52 - 1400.64] universe wanting you to heal whatever
[1399.36 - 1402.64] you believe
[1400.64 - 1406.00] whatever it is
[1402.64 - 1406.00] that you have around you
[1407.52 - 1411.36] you open the door
[1409.28 - 1413.84] for healing to happen
[1411.36 - 1415.92] when you push back the fillers a little
[1413.84 - 1417.60] bit just push them back a little bit you
[1415.92 - 1419.28] don't have to push them all the way back
[1417.60 - 1421.36] you're just pushing back a little and
[1419.28 - 1425.68] everything starts to change
[1421.36 - 1425.68] everything starts to change
[1426.00 - 1429.52] it's incredible
[1427.44 - 1431.60] tara said
[1429.52 - 1433.84] look on his website the recipe is there
[1431.60 - 1436.84] on his page so lots of recipes on
[1433.84 - 1436.84] medicalmedium.com
[1438.24 - 1445.36] if you're too busy eating pork
[1441.68 - 1447.28] so that's a filler right there pork's a
[1445.36 - 1449.44] big filler
[1447.28 - 1451.68] just letting everybody know right now
[1449.44 - 1454.72] when you eat pork
[1451.68 - 1456.24] you really hamper your pancreas you hurt
[1454.72 - 1458.48] your liver
[1456.24 - 1460.48] but it's not just that
[1458.48 - 1463.04] you have it's a filler
[1460.48 - 1464.48] ham pork chops
[1463.04 - 1466.24] pulled pork
[1464.48 - 1468.40] bacon
[1466.24 - 1469.76] bacon is one of those fillers that takes
[1468.40 - 1472.40] up your diet
[1469.76 - 1474.64] doesn't give you anything back you get
[1472.40 - 1476.88] nothing back
[1474.64 - 1479.68] it takes away you get nothing back but
[1476.88 - 1481.44] it's one of those fillers
[1479.68 - 1483.04] so it's something where if you get rid
[1481.44 - 1485.20] of the bacon
[1483.04 - 1488.08] you get rid of the ham you just open the
[1485.20 - 1489.76] door you bring in those steamed potatoes
[1488.08 - 1491.28] you bring in that bring in that kabocha
[1489.76 - 1493.84] squash you bring in that butternut
[1491.28 - 1495.92] squash you bring in that deli delicata
[1493.84 - 1497.68] squash you bring in that red curry
[1495.92 - 1498.96] squash
[1497.68 - 1500.56] you can just bring in bring in the
[1498.96 - 1503.12] spaghetti squash
[1500.56 - 1505.28] but you can bring in different options
[1503.12 - 1507.12] bring in the steamed vegetables bring in
[1505.28 - 1509.12] the steamed broccoli the steamed
[1507.12 - 1512.32] asparagus the steamed brussels sprouts
[1509.12 - 1512.32] you bring these things in
[1512.64 - 1516.80] so
[1513.52 - 1519.20] jaylon rumble says or ask is egg white
[1516.80 - 1521.76] as bad as a yolk it is
[1519.20 - 1523.28] it's bad in a different way the yolk has
[1521.76 - 1524.40] more fat in it
[1523.28 - 1526.40] right
[1524.40 - 1529.40] yolk has more fat in it
[1526.40 - 1529.40] okay
[1529.68 - 1533.92] all right so that's that's why the yolk
[1531.76 - 1534.80] is is pretty bad
[1533.92 - 1536.56] but
[1534.80 - 1540.08] but regardless of
[1536.56 - 1542.40] whether the egg white or the yolk
[1540.08 - 1543.60] it's all bad because it feeds the bugs
[1542.40 - 1546.64] so let me just show you right here
[1543.60 - 1548.24] because i have to show you
[1546.64 - 1551.04] okay
[1548.24 - 1553.52] so when you eat an egg
[1551.04 - 1556.96] it becomes food for these guys in you
[1553.52 - 1558.56] yeast mold fungus
[1556.96 - 1560.56] viruses
[1558.56 - 1561.68] bacteria
[1560.56 - 1564.00] feeds
[1561.68 - 1566.96] on eggs when you eat the eggs when egg
[1564.00 - 1568.64] particles are floating around your body
[1566.96 - 1571.36] all the bugs
[1568.64 - 1573.52] that make you have lupus fibromyalgia
[1571.36 - 1576.40] rheumatoid arthritis hashimoto's
[1573.52 - 1580.72] thyroiditis neurological lyme
[1576.40 - 1583.12] acne eczema psoriasis dizziness vertigo
[1580.72 - 1584.56] tinnitus aches and pains
[1583.12 - 1586.88] it's these bugs
[1584.56 - 1588.64] that feed off of foods like eggs that's
[1586.88 - 1590.24] why i don't like eggs as a filler i
[1588.64 - 1592.24] don't like eggs i'd rather have you eat
[1590.24 - 1593.68] oatmeal any day if if you were to tell
[1592.24 - 1595.20] me i'm going to either eat eggs or
[1593.68 - 1597.44] oatmeal
[1595.20 - 1599.60] and uh and pick and choose the filler
[1597.44 - 1601.20] i'd be like filler filler
[1599.60 - 1603.68] lots of oatmeal
[1601.20 - 1606.80] doesn't matter if it's a filler
[1603.68 - 1609.52] at least the oatmeal won't feed the bugs
[1606.80 - 1610.96] because oatmeal won't feed the viruses
[1609.52 - 1613.52] and the bacteria in the fungus and the
[1610.96 - 1615.60] yeast of the mold
[1613.52 - 1616.56] oatmeal won't feed that but the eggs
[1615.60 - 1618.24] will
[1616.56 - 1622.00] that's why i don't like eggs as a filler
[1618.24 - 1624.48] eggs is a bad filler that's a bad filler
[1622.00 - 1626.16] that's a bad one
[1624.48 - 1627.76] the funny thing is is all the vegan
[1626.16 - 1629.68] people and the plant-based people the
[1627.76 - 1632.40] minute they get a symptom or they get
[1629.68 - 1633.68] sick they run back to eggs first
[1632.40 - 1635.04] and then they're just eating eggs and
[1633.68 - 1636.16] they have no idea why they're sick
[1635.04 - 1638.16] that's why they're eating eggs and they
[1636.16 - 1639.76] have no idea eggs feed
[1638.16 - 1640.88] the very viruses and bacteria that are
[1639.76 - 1642.08] making them sick and the yeast in the
[1640.88 - 1643.28] fungus and mold but they don't they
[1642.08 - 1644.80] don't know
[1643.28 - 1646.56] so all the vegan people and plant-based
[1644.80 - 1648.32] people just run back to eggs as fast
[1646.56 - 1650.32] they can that's why they don't it's why
[1648.32 - 1652.48] they don't really attack eggs i don't
[1650.32 - 1654.24] know if you know this
[1652.48 - 1656.56] but the vegan world and the plant-based
[1654.24 - 1657.84] world they'll attack meat meat eaters
[1656.56 - 1659.28] and
[1657.84 - 1661.36] they don't really like to say something
[1659.28 - 1664.96] about eggs too much because guess what
[1661.36 - 1664.96] every month they're having an egg or two
[1666.00 - 1671.12] not all of them
[1669.36 - 1673.28] so
[1671.12 - 1675.44] i'm rumble compassion nco good to see
[1673.28 - 1677.92] you
[1675.44 - 1680.32] love your mm liver rescue it helped me
[1677.92 - 1681.60] heal my migraines i've suffered for 30
[1680.32 - 1683.04] years
[1681.60 - 1685.20] wow
[1683.04 - 1688.64] wow right on rumble
[1685.20 - 1690.16] i'm glad you're here it's an honor
[1688.64 - 1692.32] what kind of fillers are you guys on i
[1690.16 - 1694.64] just want to ask rebecca says why are
[1692.32 - 1697.44] people with ic intolerant
[1694.64 - 1699.76] to so many good
[1697.44 - 1701.20] to so many good free good good for you
[1699.76 - 1702.64] fruits and veggies
[1701.20 - 1705.68] i have i see
[1702.64 - 1707.68] and struggle to get enough to eat
[1705.68 - 1709.52] does not cause a flare
[1707.68 - 1710.96] will these intolerances go away as i
[1709.52 - 1712.96] heal
[1710.96 - 1714.08] well the thing is with ic it's it's like
[1712.96 - 1716.88] this okay
[1714.08 - 1719.12] i see worsens from foods that you don't
[1716.88 - 1720.64] feel any discomfort from
[1719.12 - 1721.52] because i see
[1720.64 - 1724.32] right
[1721.52 - 1727.28] is caused by pathogens so that's what i
[1724.32 - 1730.64] see is caused with right interstitial
[1727.28 - 1732.88] status is caused by pathogens
[1730.64 - 1735.36] so these pathogens
[1732.88 - 1738.96] they make a home in the bladder the the
[1735.36 - 1741.20] urethra uti right the trap the the
[1738.96 - 1743.36] urinary tract and they make a home and
[1741.20 - 1745.84] that home gets really
[1743.36 - 1748.64] patched up and rough
[1745.84 - 1751.20] gets beat up in there and so
[1748.64 - 1752.56] what happens is that you eat things like
[1751.20 - 1754.88] eggs and
[1752.56 - 1756.56] your you think your ic is under control
[1754.88 - 1757.92] and you eat things like
[1756.56 - 1760.16] some meat and you think it's under
[1757.92 - 1761.84] control but
[1760.16 - 1763.60] it's okay to eat some meat but it
[1761.84 - 1765.12] becomes a filler in your life it's not
[1763.60 - 1767.12] opening up the door for something that's
[1765.12 - 1768.48] going to heal your ic
[1767.12 - 1770.16] what happens is
[1768.48 - 1772.40] fruits and that's the question right
[1770.16 - 1774.88] there you said fruits why is fruits but
[1772.40 - 1777.44] why do fruits bother healthy fruits
[1774.88 - 1779.12] bother some people with ic
[1777.44 - 1782.80] it bothers them
[1779.12 - 1786.48] because they're raw inside
[1782.80 - 1788.72] they're raw inside that urinary tract
[1786.48 - 1791.12] they're raw because they got the in
[1788.72 - 1792.40] long-term infections of streptococcus
[1791.12 - 1794.80] they got the
[1792.40 - 1796.56] long-term infections of epstein-barr
[1794.80 - 1800.40] they got the long-term infections of
[1796.56 - 1803.44] bacteria and so it's raw to the bone so
[1800.40 - 1805.92] when you put astringency on it when you
[1803.44 - 1807.44] start putting something astringent on it
[1805.92 - 1809.52] like some buries
[1807.44 - 1811.36] you're you're eating and the berries go
[1809.52 - 1814.08] down or some oranges you're going down
[1811.36 - 1817.28] right and then that those berries and
[1814.08 - 1819.04] those oranges are detoxing the body and
[1817.28 - 1821.92] all that acid that's sitting inside
[1819.04 - 1824.00] people's bodies starts to come out along
[1821.92 - 1826.00] with the astringent power of some
[1824.00 - 1828.16] healing fruits you're going to feel
[1826.00 - 1829.92] something with i see but yet that's how
[1828.16 - 1832.24] you heal i see
[1829.92 - 1834.00] so i tell people with intracellulitis i
[1832.24 - 1836.40] tell them to take it easy that you do
[1834.00 - 1839.76] some bananas that does not
[1836.40 - 1842.16] bother at all you do papaya
[1839.76 - 1845.20] tell them you do papaya
[1842.16 - 1847.68] right there for instastitus
[1845.20 - 1849.44] right there papaya
[1847.68 - 1851.20] it still gets the acids out you're still
[1849.44 - 1852.48] going to have some of that acid burned
[1851.20 - 1855.44] from
[1852.48 - 1858.88] from all that poison in the body
[1855.44 - 1858.88] but that's one thing you can do
[1861.52 - 1865.44] so today i just wanted to run by you
[1863.36 - 1867.68] guys a few things
[1865.44 - 1870.80] i want to run by
[1867.68 - 1872.72] what fillers are you eating
[1870.80 - 1875.36] and how can we
[1872.72 - 1878.32] slowly move some of those fillers
[1875.36 - 1880.40] to a lower level in the diet so we can
[1878.32 - 1882.00] get something else in there
[1880.40 - 1883.68] how many zucchinis are eating are you
[1882.00 - 1885.84] doing steamed zucchinis you can do
[1883.68 - 1887.92] steamed zucchinis you can do steamed
[1885.84 - 1891.40] asparagus every day what does i see it's
[1887.92 - 1891.40] interstitial cystitis
[1893.84 - 1898.40] uh hopefully that's the ic that
[1896.56 - 1900.80] they're asking about
[1898.40 - 1903.68] maybe you know maybe it's someone can
[1900.80 - 1905.44] also make a mistake and and do i see for
[1903.68 - 1906.56] incontinence or something or something
[1905.44 - 1909.28] else
[1906.56 - 1911.36] but it should be that
[1909.28 - 1914.32] so you create brown rice
[1911.36 - 1916.24] i see that what are you guys eating
[1914.32 - 1917.28] if eggs are cooked properly wouldn't it
[1916.24 - 1919.76] be
[1917.28 - 1921.92] wouldn't it be dead to the virus
[1919.76 - 1925.36] no it's it's it's
[1921.92 - 1928.32] thresa it's the it's what's in the egg
[1925.36 - 1931.44] that the virus feeds on dead or alive
[1928.32 - 1931.44] when you eat the egg
[1933.12 - 1938.56] it's the undeveloped proteins
[1936.64 - 1941.12] in the eggs
[1938.56 - 1943.28] undeveloped proteins whether they're
[1941.12 - 1945.36] cooked or the raw the undeveloped
[1943.28 - 1949.84] protein because the chicken hasn't been
[1945.36 - 1949.84] formed yet so when you eat the chicken
[1950.24 - 1953.84] the chicken
[1951.76 - 1955.60] won't feed a virus
[1953.84 - 1957.76] a chicken is not anti-viral
[1955.60 - 1959.76] anti-bacterial anti-anything no it's
[1957.76 - 1962.64] it's not a healing food you can eat it
[1959.76 - 1964.32] it's a filler it's a filler but it's not
[1962.64 - 1965.36] a healer
[1964.32 - 1967.60] chicken
[1965.36 - 1969.12] is not a healer
[1967.60 - 1972.32] right
[1969.12 - 1974.84] eggs the undeveloped protein in eggs
[1972.32 - 1979.28] feeds all the
[1974.84 - 1979.28] bugs it feeds all the bugs
[1980.08 - 1984.48] that that's what happened so when you
[1982.00 - 1986.24] eat the egg whether it's alive or cooked
[1984.48 - 1989.28] your the bugs in your body are going
[1986.24 - 1991.36] whoa whoa food food food now let's get a
[1989.28 - 1993.20] flare up of lupus down the road let's
[1991.36 - 1995.20] get a flare up of fibro down the road
[1993.20 - 1996.96] let's get the neurological lime moving
[1995.20 - 1998.40] up a notch
[1996.96 - 1999.92] let's get every other problem multiple
[1998.40 - 2002.16] sclerosis worse
[1999.92 - 2004.64] steve manson says
[2002.16 - 2006.56] i have my lemon water first then celery
[2004.64 - 2008.80] juice then heavy metal detox then
[2006.56 - 2010.08] oatmeal that's my morning okay let's
[2008.80 - 2011.28] let's cover that for a minute first of
[2010.08 - 2014.08] all it's amazing you're having to learn
[2011.28 - 2015.36] lemon water first okay so steve
[2014.08 - 2016.16] incredible
[2015.36 - 2017.60] right
[2016.16 - 2019.20] you're moving on to your celery juice
[2017.60 - 2020.08] now
[2019.20 - 2022.88] boom
[2020.08 - 2025.84] you're moving on to your celery juice
[2022.88 - 2028.72] that's incredible you're already doing
[2025.84 - 2030.16] things that fillers would have replaced
[2028.72 - 2032.16] what if you decided just to have your
[2030.16 - 2033.92] oatmeal all morning and that was it you
[2032.16 - 2036.00] just did a filler in the morning but
[2033.92 - 2037.28] what you did you had your filler later
[2036.00 - 2039.60] on
[2037.28 - 2041.36] the oatmeal which is not antiviral not
[2039.60 - 2044.56] not anti-bacterial
[2041.36 - 2046.40] oatmeal is not anti
[2044.56 - 2050.16] yeast and mold
[2046.40 - 2052.40] but you at least got some powerhouses in
[2050.16 - 2054.16] in the morning then you had your filler
[2052.40 - 2056.80] that's okay
[2054.16 - 2058.16] but what if you
[2056.80 - 2060.16] you got a few powerhouses you got the
[2058.16 - 2062.88] heavy metal detox then the oatmeal so
[2060.16 - 2064.88] you got you got a few weapons in there
[2062.88 - 2067.04] of healing and then you did the then you
[2064.88 - 2068.72] did the filler later that's what it is
[2067.04 - 2069.84] that's your morning that's great but can
[2068.72 - 2071.92] you imagine
[2069.84 - 2072.88] if you did that
[2071.92 - 2074.88] right
[2072.88 - 2076.32] and then you did potatoes maybe for
[2074.88 - 2078.24] lunch like some steamed potatoes because
[2076.32 - 2079.92] potatoes aren't filler they're antiviral
[2078.24 - 2081.84] still they're anti-bacterial they're the
[2079.92 - 2084.24] anti-yeast and the anti-anti-mold what
[2081.84 - 2086.00] if you did avocados with one of the
[2084.24 - 2088.80] medical medium recipes what if you did
[2086.00 - 2090.80] it with some cilantro what if you did
[2088.80 - 2092.64] with any avocados potatoes what if you
[2090.80 - 2094.72] did your potatoes with cilantro what if
[2092.64 - 2096.16] you did your potatoes spirit cracked at
[2094.72 - 2097.36] me that time spirit of compassion
[2096.16 - 2098.96] corrected me
[2097.36 - 2100.32] what if you did
[2098.96 - 2102.96] some kale
[2100.32 - 2105.52] would have did some leafy greens right
[2102.96 - 2108.24] and then you did the oatmeal later on in
[2105.52 - 2111.04] the end of the day or later on in the
[2108.24 - 2112.80] afternoon you just did more more healing
[2111.04 - 2115.20] foods more healing foods and then you
[2112.80 - 2116.64] did your filler even later
[2115.20 - 2117.76] and later
[2116.64 - 2120.24] and what if
[2117.76 - 2123.12] at dinner time you did steamed asparagus
[2120.24 - 2124.80] steamed brussels sprouts more greens
[2123.12 - 2127.28] some tomatoes
[2124.80 - 2129.04] all of that
[2127.28 - 2130.80] and maybe threw a half an avocado on
[2129.04 - 2132.88] there too
[2130.80 - 2134.80] which is the best of all the fillers
[2132.88 - 2136.40] maybe you had some winter squash
[2134.80 - 2137.68] and you did all that and then you didn't
[2136.40 - 2139.68] do your oatmeal
[2137.68 - 2141.52] literally you just avoided a whole day
[2139.68 - 2143.12] of fillers
[2141.52 - 2144.72] but i'm not saying everybody has to do
[2143.12 - 2146.32] that
[2144.72 - 2148.48] okay

[2238.56 - 2243.28] how come protein doesn't michelle l that
[2240.88 - 2246.00] word triggers you protein
[2243.28 - 2248.72] juan says if we are into building muscle
[2246.00 - 2251.04] what else can we eat with medical medium
[2248.72 - 2252.40] i want to heal but not lose so much
[2251.04 - 2253.52] muscle
[2252.40 - 2257.12] one
[2253.52 - 2259.44] what keeps your muscles on is calories
[2257.12 - 2262.00] calories
[2259.44 - 2264.64] that's what keeps your muscles on
[2262.00 - 2266.72] it's calories and trace mineral salts
[2264.64 - 2270.08] that's what keeps muscle on
[2266.72 - 2272.00] if you take away your carbohydrates
[2270.08 - 2273.60] if you you should check out frogman on
[2272.00 - 2277.76] instagram
[2273.60 - 2277.76] juan check out frogman on instagram
[2279.76 - 2284.88] he builds muscle
[2282.00 - 2287.84] you can build muscle with fruits
[2284.88 - 2290.24] vegetables herbs leafy greens potatoes
[2287.84 - 2292.24] all that it's it's about mineral salts
[2290.24 - 2293.52] and calories that's how we build our
[2292.24 - 2296.48] muscle
[2293.52 - 2298.48] protein doesn't build our muscle
[2296.48 - 2301.04] i told the story on rumble you got to
[2298.48 - 2303.20] see the rumble on protein honestly
[2301.04 - 2306.00] watch the rumble episode about protein
[2303.20 - 2308.64] you're minorly blown i talk about
[2306.00 - 2310.64] a study they did
[2308.64 - 2314.08] on people
[2310.64 - 2315.92] that murdered a hundred people
[2314.08 - 2317.68] it murdered a hundred people they
[2315.92 - 2319.76] couldn't get out of the study
[2317.68 - 2321.76] and they had to sit there and starve to
[2319.76 - 2324.16] death and die
[2321.76 - 2326.88] because all they fed them
[2324.16 - 2328.56] was protein isolated protein they took
[2326.88 - 2331.52] the calorie out they took the
[2328.56 - 2334.00] carbohydrate out
[2331.52 - 2335.92] they took the fat out
[2334.00 - 2337.68] and because there wasn't even fat in
[2335.92 - 2339.36] there and they separated the protein
[2337.68 - 2341.28] from the fat they separated the protein
[2339.36 - 2342.56] from the calories they separated the
[2341.28 - 2344.48] protein from the carbohydrate they
[2342.56 - 2346.72] separated the protein from everything
[2344.48 - 2348.96] everybody sat in there for a couple of
[2346.72 - 2351.04] months
[2348.96 - 2353.20] until they died
[2351.04 - 2355.20] they wasted away as if they were in a
[2353.20 - 2358.88] concentration camp and they couldn't
[2355.20 - 2360.64] back out because the study was years ago
[2358.88 - 2363.92] right now you can back out of a study
[2360.64 - 2366.24] now if you become part of a test study
[2363.92 - 2368.40] of some kind now there is a clause in
[2366.24 - 2369.92] the contract that says if you start
[2368.40 - 2371.68] getting really ill or start falling
[2369.92 - 2373.36] apart or something happens to you you
[2371.68 - 2375.84] can leave
[2373.36 - 2378.88] but back then
[2375.84 - 2378.88] 60 years ago
[2379.20 - 2383.12] okay
[2380.48 - 2385.20] 60 years ago 70 years ago you couldn't
[2383.12 - 2386.40] leave the study you signed your life
[2385.20 - 2388.40] away
[2386.40 - 2390.32] and then 100 people watched each other
[2388.40 - 2392.96] die and some of them started eating
[2390.32 - 2395.12] other people some people died in there
[2392.96 - 2398.24] and others were actually eating
[2395.12 - 2398.24] other people in there
[2400.32 - 2403.44] and that's what happens when you feed
[2401.68 - 2404.72] somebody just protein and you take out
[2403.44 - 2407.84] the carbohydrate because the
[2404.72 - 2409.44] carbohydrate is how the muscle stays
[2407.84 - 2411.28] stay strong
[2409.44 - 2413.68] take all carbohydrates away from a
[2411.28 - 2416.16] bodybuilder take them all away
[2413.68 - 2418.48] what do you think bulking and cutting is
[2416.16 - 2421.20] bulking and cutting they end up eating
[2418.48 - 2422.88] all this carbohydrate with fat but they
[2421.20 - 2424.48] end up eating all this carbohydrate all
[2422.88 - 2425.68] this carbohydrate and they bulk up and
[2424.48 - 2427.60] they bulk up and they're doing the
[2425.68 - 2429.44] weights and they're bulking up bulking
[2427.60 - 2431.44] up and then they have to cut their
[2429.44 - 2433.44] calories back again it hopes to lose the
[2431.44 - 2435.04] fat but keep the muscle it's a game they
[2433.44 - 2437.12] try to survive with it's bulking and
[2435.04 - 2438.32] cutting bulk up eat more carbohydrate
[2437.12 - 2440.08] eat more carbohydrate eat more
[2438.32 - 2441.84] carbohydrate and then you're bulking up
[2440.08 - 2443.52] you're bulking up you're bulking up and
[2441.84 - 2445.84] then you're really fat because you ate
[2443.52 - 2447.92] carbohydrates with fats combined so
[2445.84 - 2449.44] you've got fat and muscly so then they
[2447.92 - 2451.20] go well i don't like the way i look i
[2449.44 - 2453.44] look too fat even though i got lots of
[2451.20 - 2455.04] muscle so i better i better now cut my
[2453.44 - 2456.64] calories down cut my calories down and
[2455.04 - 2458.24] then they try to shed the fat but keep
[2456.64 - 2460.08] the muscle it's a game it's called
[2458.24 - 2462.00] bulking and cutting but what they don't
[2460.08 - 2464.32] understand is you don't do the fat so
[2462.00 - 2466.40] much you bulk up on the carbohydrates
[2464.32 - 2469.76] and you work out and boom you got
[2466.40 - 2469.76] muscles and you're not as fat
[2473.52 - 2477.52] look
[2475.36 - 2479.68] you can be an animal protein person you
[2477.52 - 2481.84] can be a plant-based person
[2479.68 - 2484.64] and i'm not telling you no
[2481.84 - 2486.80] you can't eat that meat no you can't eat
[2484.64 - 2488.72] that salmon no you can't eat that
[2486.80 - 2491.52] chicken if you're plant-based no you
[2488.72 - 2493.28] can't eat those nuts and seeds no no no
[2491.52 - 2495.68] i'm not saying that
[2493.28 - 2498.64] what i'm saying is
[2495.68 - 2501.68] where's your medicine
[2498.64 - 2501.68] because it ain't chicken
[2501.92 - 2507.04] and it ain't a whole bunch of nuts and
[2503.68 - 2509.12] seeds and nut butters and oils
[2507.04 - 2511.68] that's not medicine
[2509.12 - 2514.24] it's not medicine enough
[2511.68 - 2516.40] your medicine is not bacon
[2514.24 - 2520.80] your medicine's not eggs
[2516.40 - 2523.36] your medicine isn't sunflower seeds
[2520.80 - 2525.20] where's your medicine
[2523.36 - 2527.12] like the real stuff the stuff that's
[2525.20 - 2528.88] going to help you cleanse the stuff
[2527.12 - 2531.04] that's going to help save your life if
[2528.88 - 2533.20] you're ever down on your hands and knees
[2531.04 - 2535.20] begging for god to help
[2533.20 - 2537.44] you know the whole thing is
[2535.20 - 2540.00] i've run into so many people over the
[2537.44 - 2542.00] years and i've helped
[2540.00 - 2544.24] tens and tens of thousands of people
[2542.00 - 2546.96] throughout the years right 35 years
[2544.24 - 2548.96] of helping people get their lives back
[2546.96 - 2550.32] and then the medical medium book series
[2548.96 - 2553.12] right here if you don't have liver
[2550.32 - 2554.40] rescue take advantage of the 53 off or
[2553.12 - 2556.00] get it free at the library if you have
[2554.40 - 2556.96] to get it free at the library i don't
[2556.00 - 2558.24] care
[2556.96 - 2560.32] right now it's not going to help me if
[2558.24 - 2562.72] you buy liver rescue because it costs
[2560.32 - 2564.72] more to print it
[2562.72 - 2567.44] but the point is
[2564.72 - 2569.60] as you go to if you have these books you
[2567.44 - 2571.52] can arm yourself with information and
[2569.60 - 2573.28] the point i'm trying to say is
[2571.52 - 2574.32] right
[2573.28 - 2576.32] out of
[2574.32 - 2579.04] all the years
[2576.32 - 2580.16] and the people that i've watched that
[2579.04 - 2582.96] have been just
[2580.16 - 2584.72] sick and so sick i've seen people that
[2582.96 - 2586.72] weren't religious
[2584.72 - 2588.80] weren't religious on any level
[2586.72 - 2591.04] i didn't even believe in god which is
[2588.80 - 2593.20] fine you can believe in god you don't
[2591.04 - 2595.76] believe in god it doesn't matter to me
[2593.20 - 2596.72] i don't judge anybody for anything
[2595.76 - 2598.32] but
[2596.72 - 2600.08] i've seen people that not religious at
[2598.32 - 2602.24] all
[2600.08 - 2603.76] that no way god exists and then they get
[2602.24 - 2605.44] really sick and they're on their hands
[2603.76 - 2606.64] and knees and now they're praying to god
[2605.44 - 2608.56] first time in their life they're on
[2606.64 - 2610.64] their hands and knees they're so sick
[2608.56 - 2613.12] that they even they're even praying to
[2610.64 - 2615.20] god now because they're so sick they
[2613.12 - 2616.32] can't believe how sick they are and they
[2615.20 - 2617.92] don't know how to get out of it because
[2616.32 - 2620.48] they went through the 50th doctor and
[2617.92 - 2622.40] 50th specialist you guys are so sad they
[2620.48 - 2624.32] went to their 50th specialist
[2622.40 - 2625.76] and they've been so sick
[2624.32 - 2627.36] and now they weren't even a religious
[2625.76 - 2628.64] person and now they're down on their
[2627.36 - 2629.76] hands and knees and they're praying to
[2628.64 - 2634.36] god
[2629.76 - 2634.36] god help me god help me
[2634.48 - 2637.52] and i've seen people religious that
[2635.92 - 2639.28] don't believe in jesus christ they're
[2637.52 - 2640.96] religion that's fine you do whatever you
[2639.28 - 2642.24] want we i've seen people who are
[2640.96 - 2643.68] religious that don't believe in jesus
[2642.24 - 2644.88] christ and they get sick and they get so
[2643.68 - 2647.68] sick and now they're on their hands and
[2644.88 - 2649.84] knees saying jesus christ save me jesus
[2647.68 - 2651.36] come help me jesus that's what they're

[2651.36 - 2654.88] they're religious that had a religion
[2653.52 - 2657.28] and now all of a sudden they're just
[2654.88 - 2658.64] praying to god to send jesus christ to
[2657.28 - 2660.08] help them
[2658.64 - 2661.12] i've seen people that don't believe in
[2660.08 - 2663.36] angels
[2661.12 - 2665.44] the kids said oh no one can convince him
[2663.36 - 2667.04] an angel exists no one can convince them
[2665.44 - 2668.32] and then they get sick and they're down
[2667.04 - 2670.08] on their hands and knees and down on
[2668.32 - 2672.24] their hands and knees and they're like

[2786.24 - 2791.20] we were a snail and then the snail
[2789.12 - 2792.32] crawled up the shore and we became a
[2791.20 - 2794.24] lizard
[2792.32 - 2797.20] then the lizard was on the edge of the
[2794.24 - 2799.28] shore and the lizard grew into a possum
[2797.20 - 2802.64] and then the possum
[2799.28 - 2804.00] possum grew into uh
[2802.64 - 2807.44] a bear
[2804.00 - 2809.84] and then the bear grew into a monkey
[2807.44 - 2812.16] and then a monkey grew into a giraffe
[2809.84 - 2814.08] then a drew draft grew into a tiger and
[2812.16 - 2816.00] then finally we became i don't know
[2814.08 - 2817.36] tiger became a gorilla and then the
[2816.00 - 2818.72] grill and all of a sudden we became
[2817.36 - 2819.52] human and now we say well where'd the
[2818.72 - 2822.96] other
[2819.52 - 2822.96] what happened to the other gorillas
[2823.44 - 2828.32] what happened to the other monkeys
[2824.80 - 2828.32] because i'm confused about that one
[2828.88 - 2832.48] i've seen people who don't
[2830.40 - 2835.28] who don't who actually just think we
[2832.48 - 2836.96] just we just live on a rock we die
[2835.28 - 2839.20] we don't have a soul in the end it just
[2836.96 - 2840.40] disappears we die i've seen them when
[2839.20 - 2843.52] they get sick
[2840.40 - 2845.52] on their hands and knees like
[2843.52 - 2847.28] i know i'm more than this and they're on
[2845.52 - 2849.44] their hands and knees i know more this i
[2847.28 - 2851.36] need help i want answers
[2849.44 - 2853.04] you know and all of a sudden god god
[2851.36 - 2856.08] help me
[2853.04 - 2859.84] that's what when we get sick
[2856.08 - 2859.84] that's what can happen right
[2860.56 - 2864.48] daisy says what about emergency food
[2862.72 - 2866.56] supplies what do you recommend that's
[2864.48 - 2868.72] okay if it's fillers
[2866.56 - 2870.00] emergency food supplies
[2868.72 - 2871.20] well i'll give you a couple rundowns
[2870.00 - 2872.96] right now you know what i'll do a rumble
[2871.20 - 2873.76] on it too sometime a whole rumble on it
[2872.96 - 2875.84] okay
[2873.76 - 2877.04] but emergency food supplies
[2875.84 - 2879.36] first of all
[2877.04 - 2880.96] freezer stuff is important
[2879.36 - 2883.04] that's important
[2880.96 - 2885.44] right meaning like you know you run out
[2883.04 - 2887.84] of food food shortage there's no food
[2885.44 - 2889.92] you want at least enough in the freezer
[2887.84 - 2892.40] so keep that in mind so you can freeze
[2889.92 - 2894.88] fruit you can freeze bananas i got a lot
[2892.40 - 2896.56] of bananas in my freezer a lot of frozen
[2894.88 - 2898.72] bananas
[2896.56 - 2900.32] that's something you can do right
[2898.72 - 2901.76] and one day i'll talk about a whole list
[2900.32 - 2902.88] i'll do a rumble with a whole list of
[2901.76 - 2905.68] different stuff
[2902.88 - 2907.36] or do an amazon live or something
[2905.68 - 2909.12] you know and we'll do that okay we'll do
[2907.36 - 2910.72] maybe we'll do an amazon live and
[2909.12 - 2914.88] because we can make stuff too and
[2910.72 - 2916.72] everything else will be fun right
[2914.88 - 2919.20] but anyway just want to let you guys
[2916.72 - 2921.68] know about that book though it's 51 off
[2919.20 - 2923.92] amazon.com us
[2921.68 - 2923.92] right
[2924.00 - 2928.00] question on rumble why do they say if
[2925.92 - 2931.28] you have a cold or fluid chicken soup
[2928.00 - 2933.60] because it's soup it's lighter
[2931.28 - 2935.44] it's lighter
[2933.60 - 2938.00] they don't tell you to eat it
[2935.44 - 2941.28] thanksgiving dinner because somewhere
[2938.00 - 2943.28] along the line somebody figured it out
[2941.28 - 2945.28] that if you eat too much when you're
[2943.28 - 2947.60] sick with the flu and you can't eat
[2945.28 - 2950.72] anything you just vomited you got
[2947.60 - 2954.32] diarrhea you got a high fever the last
[2950.72 - 2957.92] thing you need is a big old turkey wedge
[2954.32 - 2961.84] sub or a big old meatball grinder or a
[2957.92 - 2964.08] big old philly cheesesteak sandwich or
[2961.84 - 2966.48] when you got the flu you don't need a
[2964.08 - 2968.72] pizza when you got the flu because when
[2966.48 - 2970.80] you got the flu and you go eat a big old
[2968.72 - 2972.88] pizza pie your butt's going to be
[2970.80 - 2974.96] probably cranking that fever higher than
[2972.88 - 2977.36] it was to begin with it was 102 fever
[2974.96 - 2980.64] it's going to be 104 by the night's over
[2977.36 - 2983.52] so what they found out was you eat light
[2980.64 - 2986.08] you eat light when you have the flu and
[2983.52 - 2988.08] since people can't give up chicken who
[2986.08 - 2989.60] love chicken it's better to just have a
[2988.08 - 2992.80] little chicken in the soup and then
[2989.60 - 2995.68] you're sipping all the vegetables
[2992.80 - 2997.76] what's healing about your chicken soup
[2995.68 - 2999.36] i know this is gonna piss off somebody i
[2997.76 - 3000.64] can't do a show without pissing off
[2999.36 - 3002.32] somebody's not gonna piss you off that
[3000.64 - 3003.84] asks a question i'm sure but this is
[3002.32 - 3005.76] gonna piss off somebody i'll have the
[3003.84 - 3008.32] chicken soup people on me
[3005.76 - 3009.84] i have so many people on you guys you
[3008.32 - 3013.04] don't even know you should see what half

[3013.04 - 3017.44] gotta do i have so many people i got so
[3015.52 - 3020.32] many people making up fake crap fake
[3017.44 - 3021.76] stories doing this doing that i got so
[3020.32 - 3024.24] many industries that are putting all
[3021.76 - 3026.08] kinds of trolls out there i got so many
[3024.24 - 3027.76] people out there trying to chip me away
[3026.08 - 3030.56] at every different angle you guys have
[3027.76 - 3032.72] no idea the apple cider vinegar
[3030.56 - 3034.80] the earth particle you know crew the
[3032.72 - 3036.48] charcoal crew everybody in the sun and
[3034.80 - 3038.00] they got bucks they got millions and
[3036.48 - 3039.76] millions of bucks man and they send
[3038.00 - 3042.24] people out to put out fake stories fake
[3039.76 - 3043.36] this fake that do this bad media you
[3042.24 - 3046.00] name it
[3043.36 - 3048.88] because i put the truth out there

[3052.64 - 3056.00] navigating the amount of tax i have
[3054.48 - 3057.04] behind the scenes that nobody even knows

[3057.04 - 3061.12] that's my life outside of writing the
[3058.80 - 3062.40] books
[3061.12 - 3064.08] here's the deal
[3062.40 - 3066.80] chicken soup is healing because of the
[3064.08 - 3068.72] broth because of the onion
[3066.80 - 3071.20] it's onion
[3068.72 - 3071.20] onion
[3071.36 - 3076.56] in your chicken soup it's the carrot
[3073.92 - 3078.16] it's the onion
[3076.56 - 3080.64] that's what's healing in your chicken
[3078.16 - 3083.36] soup you got the flu you got the onion
[3080.64 - 3085.92] and garlic i got relatives that make
[3083.36 - 3087.44] chicken soup
[3085.92 - 3088.56] but they because they can't they can't
[3087.44 - 3090.08] let go of their chickens and they make
[3088.56 - 3091.60] the chicken soup they've got garlic in
[3090.08 - 3094.08] there they've got onions in there i
[3091.60 - 3096.08] always say nana nana
[3094.08 - 3098.40] i'm like nana
[3096.08 - 3100.40] right nana you got to put garlic in
[3098.40 - 3104.16] there nana you've got to put
[3100.40 - 3104.16] nana you got to put onion in there
[3104.56 - 3109.68] you got and what happens is that
[3107.12 - 3112.64] that it's it's those things in the
[3109.68 - 3114.88] chicken soup when you go eat a roasted
[3112.64 - 3117.20] chicken you got the flu you eat a
[3114.88 - 3119.28] roasted chicken
[3117.20 - 3120.72] your butt's going to be sick when you
[3119.28 - 3122.48] got the flu and you eat a half of a
[3120.72 - 3123.68] roasted chicken say you're somebody
[3122.48 - 3125.36] that's used to eating a whole bunch of
[3123.68 - 3128.00] chicken drumsticks a whole bunch of
[3125.36 - 3128.00] chicken thighs
[3128.08 - 3131.68] and you go and do that rotisserie
[3129.84 - 3133.28] chicken when you got yourself 102
[3131.68 - 3135.20] temperature and you go do that you'd be
[3133.28 - 3136.48] so sick that night you'll have 104
[3135.20 - 3137.68] temperature you'll be in the hospital
[3136.48 - 3140.16] now wondering if you've got some other
[3137.68 - 3140.16] kind of thing
[3143.60 - 3147.44] chickens okay if you want to eat it but

[3438.80 - 3444.16] on tick tock i got so much to say
[3441.84 - 3445.92] and it's not because i know anything
[3444.16 - 3449.28] it's because of my source my source
[3445.92 - 3449.28] knows a heck of a lot
[3449.36 - 3452.96] half a bunch of asparagus
[3451.68 - 3455.28] do that
[3452.96 - 3458.88] do do a half a bunch
[3455.28 - 3460.72] right maybe a half a bunch do that a day
[3458.88 - 3462.24] and and then you're taking place of
[3460.72 - 3464.24] fillers but you're doing something where
[3462.24 - 3465.56] there's the medicine you know what kind
[3464.24 - 3467.68] of
[3465.56 - 3469.52] anti-anti-disease fighting compounds are
[3467.68 - 3471.28] in asparagus
[3469.52 - 3473.36] oh whoa
[3471.28 - 3474.40] you start doing that
[3473.36 - 3477.44] right
[3474.40 - 3481.44] and what about herb leafy greens
[3477.44 - 3483.44] leafy greens that are herbs
[3481.44 - 3485.04] cilantro
[3483.44 - 3486.48] i'm not talking about like this you
[3485.04 - 3488.72] ready
[3486.48 - 3489.52] let's talk about this
[3488.72 - 3491.60] so
[3489.52 - 3494.32] i'm gonna put a little bit of cilantro
[3491.60 - 3496.08] on my salmon
[3494.32 - 3497.36] you know medical medium says cilantro is
[3496.08 - 3499.20] really good
[3497.36 - 3500.72] now i'm gonna
[3499.20 - 3502.88] i'm gonna put a little cilantro on my
[3500.72 - 3504.88] salmon right there
[3502.88 - 3506.72] that's not going to get you anywhere
[3504.88 - 3508.32] that's not good i love it i love you
[3506.72 - 3510.32] know cooking shows out there like famous
[3508.32 - 3512.40] chefs and all that stuff or whatever
[3510.32 - 3513.68] do they think they they think they you
[3512.40 - 3515.28] know they got it so down because they
[3513.68 - 3517.04] put a little bit of that parsley chopped
[3515.28 - 3518.72] up on there they want that green through
[3517.04 - 3520.72] they put a scallion like a little bit of
[3518.72 - 3522.40] a chive on there they put a little bit
[3520.72 - 3524.72] on this meanwhile the whole plate is
[3522.40 - 3528.00] filler
[3524.72 - 3528.00] this isn't going to be enough
[3528.24 - 3532.48] so what you do is you have
[3530.88 - 3535.28] like the heavy metal detox smoothie and
[3532.48 - 3538.72] you put some cilantro in there you have
[3535.28 - 3541.44] cilantro as a salad okay okay okay okay
[3538.72 - 3542.24] i know you guys all love avocado
[3541.44 - 3543.28] right
[3542.24 - 3546.88] fine
[3543.28 - 3548.96] let's eat avocados let's eat avocados
[3546.88 - 3551.44] okay
[3548.96 - 3552.88] let's eat avocados let's have avocados
[3551.44 - 3554.88] all right
[3552.88 - 3556.72] let's have avocados okay i'm gonna eat
[3554.88 - 3560.72] some avocados
[3556.72 - 3563.76] but let's put them on a nice old big old
[3560.72 - 3565.44] bed of leafy green herb
[3563.76 - 3568.80] let's do that
[3565.44 - 3572.72] let's put them on a big old bed of leafy
[3568.80 - 3574.64] green herbs let's do that okay
[3572.72 - 3576.16] how does that sound
[3574.64 - 3578.48] let's do that remember what i taught you
[3576.16 - 3581.12] guys about avocado on all the videos now
[3578.48 - 3582.72] you guys remember right
[3581.12 - 3584.88] remember that get rid of that right
[3582.72 - 3586.96] there boom
[3584.88 - 3589.76] that little heart is a rock stem
[3586.96 - 3591.68] get rid of that you bite onto that
[3589.76 - 3593.76] you're in trouble fall to the guacamole
[3591.68 - 3596.72] but let's eat avocados
[3593.76 - 3598.96] i'm not anti-avocado
[3596.72 - 3600.40] but let's have avocado you want to eat
[3598.96 - 3603.04] all the avocados you want
[3600.40 - 3607.20] but let's eat it let's chop up all that
[3603.04 - 3611.48] avocado on top of a lot of herb
[3607.20 - 3611.48] and i'm not talking about this herb
[3614.72 - 3619.92] not talking about that herb
[3617.84 - 3621.84] okay is that everything
[3619.92 - 3623.68] that's not a good thing
[3621.84 - 3625.68] i'm not a fan of it
[3623.68 - 3627.28] i'm not judging you
[3625.68 - 3629.76] i'm not making funny i'm not judging you
[3627.28 - 3631.92] or nothing i love you being here you do
[3629.76 - 3633.68] what you want in your life
[3631.92 - 3634.56] okay
[3633.68 - 3636.16] but there
[3634.56 - 3638.72] but keep in mind
[3636.16 - 3641.36] if you want to do avocado you have it on
[3638.72 - 3643.52] a bed of herb
[3641.36 - 3646.00] you could do a lot of cilantro you can
[3643.52 - 3647.84] do a lot of parsley you can do you can
[3646.00 - 3649.76] do chop up a whole bunch maybe some
[3647.84 - 3651.52] lettuce too if you want maybe some kale
[3649.76 - 3653.68] and then you throw all that avocado on
[3651.52 - 3655.28] there and then you chop up a tomato you
[3653.68 - 3657.44] want it a little juicy you chop up a
[3655.28 - 3658.64] tomato you put one of these babies in
[3657.44 - 3660.72] there a little bit if you if you can
[3658.64 - 3662.48] handle some heat you pop in one of those
[3660.72 - 3664.48] maybe you put some red bell pepper maybe
[3662.48 - 3666.56] you put a little onion but what you do
[3664.48 - 3668.84] is you have your avocado salad but you
[3666.56 - 3670.48] just made a medicine
[3668.84 - 3673.84] ball
[3670.48 - 3675.52] you just made a medicine ball
[3673.84 - 3679.04] in your salad
[3675.52 - 3681.84] a medicine ball that's what you did
[3679.04 - 3681.84] that's what you did
[3682.40 - 3687.76] you made a medicine ball
[3685.52 - 3687.76] right
[3687.92 - 3693.60] so keep that in mind
[3689.84 - 3693.60] so let's go into a little bit of kale
[3694.08 - 3698.40] right
[3695.44 - 3700.72] you love your avocado
[3698.40 - 3703.52] put a little bit in your kale then
[3700.72 - 3705.36] but get your leafy greens in you now if
[3703.52 - 3707.68] you want to heal and you got a serious
[3705.36 - 3709.36] condition there's ways to heal and you
[3707.68 - 3710.72] keep the avocado out and you keep the
[3709.36 - 3711.76] meat out and you keep whatever out and
[3710.72 - 3714.48] that's a good question right now let's
[3711.76 - 3716.48] talk about that let's talk about meat
[3714.48 - 3718.80] okay
[3716.48 - 3722.00] you love your chicken
[3718.80 - 3724.72] put a little bit of chicken
[3722.00 - 3726.48] on a bed of herb
[3724.72 - 3728.32] a bed of herb
[3726.48 - 3730.32] you love your chicken
[3728.32 - 3731.20] make sure you're eating enough herb with
[3730.32 - 3733.28] it
[3731.20 - 3735.60] have that at the end of the day you love
[3733.28 - 3738.88] your meat or salmon
[3735.60 - 3741.36] make sure you have it with a lot of herb
[3738.88 - 3743.36] throw some radishes in there
[3741.36 - 3745.28] get the medicine in because you gotta
[3743.36 - 3747.04] balance the filler
[3745.28 - 3749.60] now when it comes to healing though
[3747.04 - 3751.76] healing deep seeded stuff that's still
[3749.60 - 3753.36] gonna get in the way the avocado still
[3751.76 - 3754.56] can get in the way if there's too much
[3753.36 - 3757.68] in your diet
[3754.56 - 3759.92] but the point is is you're balancing
[3757.68 - 3762.48] the filler you're actually you're
[3759.92 - 3764.40] actually tipping the scale the better
[3762.48 - 3766.64] direction
[3764.40 - 3768.88] you want to have your grass-fed beef
[3766.64 - 3771.28] pieces in a salad you put them on top of
[3768.88 - 3773.44] some parsley and some cilantro and some
[3771.28 - 3775.84] kale and you get that green in you so
[3773.44 - 3779.04] that it can help to kind of
[3775.84 - 3782.36] mediate the filler
[3779.04 - 3782.36] the filler
[3786.40 - 3789.76] and that's the way to do it
[3788.48 - 3792.16] you can do so much with steamed
[3789.76 - 3794.00] vegetables on greens you can take
[3792.16 - 3795.68] asparagus brussels sprouts you can take
[3794.00 - 3798.08] squash you can take these beautiful
[3795.68 - 3800.96] kabocha squashes right here look at that
[3798.08 - 3800.96] you can take these
[3801.68 - 3806.16] and you can steam these up
[3804.08 - 3807.60] and it's unbelievable and you chop all
[3806.16 - 3809.60] that up and all these steamed vegetables
[3807.60 - 3812.88] and you put the kombucha squash on top
[3809.60 - 3815.12] of your greens and that's not a filler
[3812.88 - 3817.60] that's medicine your squashes are
[3815.12 - 3819.28] anti-viral anti-pathogen anti-bug
[3817.60 - 3821.68] anti-this anti-that they're
[3819.28 - 3823.92] anti-everything that's bad for you and
[3821.68 - 3826.48] that's what these squashes are and that
[3823.92 - 3828.72] that when you think about that whoa
[3826.48 - 3831.76] whoa
[3828.72 - 3835.36] you feel like you want to have a coffee
[3831.76 - 3838.88] get a bunch of oranges out cut them up
[3835.36 - 3841.12] squeeze the juice out of them get a nice
[3838.88 - 3843.68] fresh orange juice down
[3841.12 - 3845.68] replace that coffee one time see what
[3843.68 - 3847.20] happens see what clicks in see what
[3845.68 - 3848.64] happens
[3847.20 - 3851.76] right
[3848.64 - 3854.24] carlene says i can't get organic veggies
[3851.76 - 3857.60] are conventional really bad
[3854.24 - 3859.28] no they're not really bad
[3857.60 - 3860.96] if you can't get organic you get
[3859.28 - 3862.72] conventional now i'm gonna get the crap
[3860.96 - 3864.24] eat out of me for that by somebody
[3862.72 - 3866.16] because someone's that's when they all
[3864.24 - 3868.56] get mad everybody gets mad and they say
[3866.16 - 3870.56] no medical medium tells everybody to eat
[3868.56 - 3872.32] the dirty dozen medical medium tells
[3870.56 - 3875.20] everybody to eat the bad pesticides
[3872.32 - 3876.56] medical medium no you can definitely do
[3875.20 - 3878.08] that i would do that in a second you
[3876.56 - 3879.44] think you think that the fruits and
[3878.08 - 3881.04] vegetables i'm eating every day are all
[3879.44 - 3883.76] organic
[3881.04 - 3885.68] you think so no
[3883.76 - 3887.92] because you know why
[3885.68 - 3890.00] because the medicine in the fruits and
[3887.92 - 3892.56] vegetables you just gotta wash them good
[3890.00 - 3895.20] the medicine in them outweigh they
[3892.56 - 3897.84] detoxify what's in that vegetable or
[3895.20 - 3899.60] fruit that's conventional it detoxifies
[3897.84 - 3901.44] it
[3899.60 - 3904.24] every single
[3901.44 - 3906.96] crop in the conventional world
[3904.24 - 3909.20] gets sprayed three times a week

[3922.56 - 3927.04] they use nicotine and all the organic
[3924.48 - 3927.04] sprays

[4008.32 - 4013.36] nicotine and msg is a neurotoxin
[4011.28 - 4014.96] msg kills insects
[4013.36 - 4016.80] doesn't kill viruses inside of us it
