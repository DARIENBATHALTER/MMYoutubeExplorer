[141.96 - 148.68] just going to dice them
[144.04 - 150.48] up and like inch to 2 in slices are fine

[162.16 - 167.12] day so these are cubes that are this
[165.28 - 169.56] size right here
[167.12 - 172.56] see
[169.56 - 177.60] and first time watching from Australia
[172.56 - 177.60] Ashley thanks for being here amazing so
[177.72 - 182.72] glad dicing these up right here so this
[180.44 - 185.48] is the healing potato
[182.72 - 188.28] salad so red potatoes are okay Barbara
[185.48 - 192.56] totally you can use red potatoes I love
[188.28 - 196.04] red potatoes um it's a great potato and
[192.56 - 199.72] you certainly can use it why steamed
[196.04 - 203.00] Lori because it preserves the nutrients
[199.72 - 206.68] like no other and it's the the makes it
[203.00 - 209.48] easy to digest a potato is easiest to
[206.68 - 211.44] digest when you steam them that's the
[209.48 - 213.56] critic key right there so you have to
[211.44 - 217.08] steam them not boil them you don't want
[213.56 - 218.68] to boil them cuz you'll boil that flavor
[217.08 - 220.72] right out of them too and it'll be in
[218.68 - 222.60] the water unless you're making a soup
[220.72 - 225.76] right unless you're making a soup but
[222.60 - 226.84] we're not making a soup and you want the
[225.76 - 230.36] steamed
[226.84 - 232.76] potatoes not not any other way for this
[230.36 - 236.64] for sure
[232.76 - 239.16] um so I'm dicing this up don't add oil
[236.64 - 241.28] don't add butter don't add cheese don't
[239.16 - 243.24] add any products that's not in the
[241.28 - 244.64] recipe plus you don't want those in
[243.24 - 245.92] there if you're actually struggling with
[244.64 - 248.08] any kind of
[245.92 - 252.40] condition you certainly don't want those
[248.08 - 254.52] in there um you love potatoes I saw that
[252.40 - 257.12] Shelly says she loves potatoes
[254.52 - 260.88] incredible I do too I do
[257.12 - 265.44] too Tama says she loves steamed
[260.88 - 265.44] potatoes incredible so I'm dicing these
[266.32 - 271.16] up hi from the
[268.72 - 274.92] Netherlands great place in Netherlands
[271.16 - 277.20] thanks for being here um what gives
[274.92 - 282.32] potatoes a bad
[277.20 - 284.88] wrap is what people do to potatoes okay
[282.32 - 287.04] it's not potatoes that give anybody any
[284.88 - 290.16] issues or problems potatoes are actually
[287.04 - 292.60] a healing food really healing what the
[290.16 - 297.64] problem is it's the milk cheese butter
[292.60 - 299.92] oil the Mayo right the egg it's all that
[297.64 - 303.32] that causes problems with potato cuz
[299.92 - 306.08] it's not the potato causing the problem
[303.32 - 308.12] it's all the dairy products the oil the
[306.08 - 310.04] the that's drenched in them frying
[308.12 - 312.00] potatoes that's another thing right
[310.04 - 314.48] there that causes problems so that's
[312.00 - 318.12] what really goes on that's what gives
[314.48 - 318.12] potatoes a bad wrap right
[318.56 - 324.20] there so I'm dicing these up making the
[321.76 - 326.20] potato salad as we speak here you can
[324.20 - 330.04] use 2 lbs of
[326.20 - 333.12] potatoes you can roughly peel them I'm
[330.04 - 337.60] roughly dicing
[333.12 - 337.60] them okay you don't have to peel
[340.92 - 344.96] them so I'm getting my potatoes in this
[343.56 - 347.68] dish right here I want to answer some
[344.96 - 347.68] questions for you
[350.08 - 357.60] too but potato is a great food Corn's
[354.20 - 359.96] not so I'm just letting you know corn is
[357.60 - 362.20] not a good thing to do cuz cuz I saw
[359.96 - 364.92] somebody say starch solution it say you
[362.20 - 368.44] know what happens is that is that you
[364.92 - 370.48] don't want corn and I know that in the
[368.44 - 373.64] old days the starch solution stuff was
[370.48 - 375.92] all about corn disaster there's problems
[373.64 - 377.84] and holes in everybody's ideas out there
[375.92 - 381.28] it's really sad how it works because
[377.84 - 382.56] nobody knows that the corn feeds viruses
[381.28 - 384.28] so when people are sick with chronic
[382.56 - 388.80] fatigue and fibro and they're eating
[384.28 - 390.52] corn in their starch meals lots of corn
[388.80 - 392.52] they don't know that contributing to
[390.52 - 395.48] feeding the very bugs that's making them
[392.52 - 398.20] sick and and really hurting them and but
[395.48 - 401.68] potato that's not the case of potato so
[398.20 - 405.28] potato's antiviral antibacterial NAA
[401.68 - 407.12] says hi from Sweden great to be here um

[456.72 - 460.64] tiny pieces for this garlic is what I'm
[463.28 - 469.68] doing you can use a mincer I just like
[466.72 - 471.24] chopping it really fine cuz that's
[469.68 - 474.00] mincing it too but I'm mincing it on the
[471.24 - 474.00] board is what I'm
[476.24 - 483.12] doing saw somebody said she uh you eat

[504.96 - 511.24] up hi from

[526.52 - 530.44] here so I'm roughly chopping
[531.29 - 538.68] [Music]
[532.64 - 538.68] it pop popping that in it's a/4 cup
[543.40 - 549.04] um got some other good stuff coming in
[545.84 - 550.52] here too and green onion is the next
[549.04 - 554.88] thing I'm going to
[550.52 - 554.88] do get a little bit of green onion in
[558.56 - 566.20] here two tablespoons of finely chopped
[561.84 - 566.20] green onion that's what I'm going to do
[577.84 - 582.64] roughly around two tablespoons right
[579.68 - 585.12] there finely green onion there we
[582.64 - 588.80] go got that in
[585.12 - 591.48] there um lemon going in here too so
[588.80 - 591.48] letting you guys
[592.04 - 596.72] know me get my lemons ready as well so
[595.00 - 599.96] there's different options you can put in
[596.72 - 602.36] here so um you can put you can put
[599.96 - 604.96] radish in this dish so I have radishes
[602.36 - 606.96] so I'm going to thinly slice those
[604.96 - 609.22] cucumber I got the English cucumbers
[606.96 - 612.43] right here can thinly slice
[609.22 - 612.43] [Music]
[617.00 - 621.60] those Caroline says love your chopping
[619.36 - 625.24] skills do you recommend digestive
[621.60 - 627.04] enzymes not really I recommend fixing
[625.24 - 629.04] the digestion that's what I do recommend
[627.04 - 631.76] so medical meum information is about
[629.04 - 633.52] give needed tools to fix things like the
[631.76 - 635.28] celery juice to fix the hydrochloric
[633.52 - 638.20] acid to fix your stomach gland so your
[635.28 - 639.76] digestion gets strong All These Years
[638.20 - 642.16] everybody was doing the digestive
[639.76 - 643.52] enzymes out there it was a big thing and
[642.16 - 645.20] they were just pumping them everywhere
[643.52 - 646.92] they still do but what people don't
[645.20 - 648.84] understand is it's a Band-Aid or you're
[646.92 - 651.36] trying to do this Band-Aid so you're
[648.84 - 653.04] doing dig digestive enzymes it's like a
[651.36 - 655.92] Band-Aid to things versus actually
[653.04 - 658.44] fixing a digestive problem fixing the
[655.92 - 659.88] the liver and its bile strength fixing
[658.44 - 661.68] the hydrochloric a
[659.88 - 663.28] in the stomach glands that that produce
[661.68 - 666.08] the gastric acid the stomach glands
[663.28 - 669.52] fixing things and then get Ri getting
[666.08 - 671.64] rid of bad bacteria through using foods
[669.52 - 673.48] and and also understanding how
[671.64 - 676.16] everything works like can cleanse the
[673.48 - 679.00] heel and the new medical medium book
[676.16 - 680.44] that's coming out um so you can learn I
[679.00 - 682.40] got a gut chapter in here that's
[680.44 - 685.56] mind-blowing so inside the medical
[682.40 - 687.88] medium uh revised and
[685.56 - 691.04] expanded so it's really about fixing
[687.88 - 694.40] things that's what I like to do
[691.04 - 696.16] um see how do I know different between
[694.40 - 698.12] cultivated and wild blueberries okay
[696.16 - 701.16] cultivated blueberries are bigger
[698.12 - 703.08] they're larger and wild blueberries will
[701.16 - 705.80] say Wild on the packaging like the
[703.08 - 707.56] Frozen wild blueberries that'll say Wild
[705.80 - 710.00] on the packaging it's in the freezer
[707.56 - 711.48] section Frozen wild blueberries so
[710.00 - 713.28] that's really important right there
[711.48 - 715.92] cultivated blueberries are in those clam
[713.28 - 717.28] shell pint siiz clam shells that you see
[715.92 - 719.24] in the grocery store where they're all
[717.28 - 721.36] stacked up and they're bigger they're
[719.24 - 723.60] their larger blueberries those are still
[721.36 - 725.88] good for you but they won't do that
[723.60 - 727.40] healing they won't do that healing that
[725.88 - 729.44] you need they won't get the toxic heavy
[727.40 - 731.60] metals out they don't even have the
[729.44 - 733.36] antioxidant level that the wild
[731.60 - 736.48] blueberries do or the phytochemical
[733.36 - 739.00] compounds wild blueberries are antiviral
[736.48 - 741.96] cultivated blueberries are not antiviral
[739.00 - 743.08] antibacterial so all those things matter
[741.96 - 746.52] um they really
[743.08 - 748.64] do so so let's do some like additions
[746.52 - 750.96] with this potato salad that I'm making
[748.64 - 753.60] you guys steing potato Sal I got the
[750.96 - 756.24] diced up Cub potatoes these are steamed
[753.60 - 758.64] potatoes just so you know I got a 1/4
[756.24 - 761.04] cup of parsley thrown in there I got a
[758.64 - 763.84] couple tablespoons of green onion diced
[761.04 - 766.36] in there and I have a clove of garlic
[763.84 - 768.20] diced too really finely and thrown in
[766.36 - 770.28] there just so you know so let's keep on
[768.20 - 771.96] going let's go into some radish land I
[770.28 - 775.80] don't know if you guys like
[771.96 - 778.04] radishes but I do sulfur comp compounds
[775.80 - 780.08] and radishes are really healing can
[778.04 - 782.56] thinly slice these rad es it's what I'm
[780.08 - 782.56] doing right
[783.00 - 791.52] now you don't need a whole lot of
[787.20 - 793.00] them so you don't need a lot of them
[791.52 - 796.96] like this is an option right here you
[793.00 - 796.96] can do a half a cup of radish put in
[797.84 - 803.36] here so I'm thinly slicing these
[800.56 - 803.36] radishes right
[805.16 - 810.28] now okay Lisa says I make potatoes and
[808.04 - 813.12] eggs together is that
[810.28 - 815.00] bad well it all depends you know if you
[813.12 - 817.40] have any symptoms going on if there's
[815.00 - 821.20] any kind of symptom you know when people
[817.40 - 823.64] have um skin conditions eczema psoriasis
[821.20 - 826.12] if they have sibo intestinal tract
[823.64 - 829.08] disorders if they have Celiac if they
[826.12 - 831.92] have Crohn's colitis chronic fatigue
[829.08 - 834.04] syndrome thyroid problems and anything
[831.92 - 836.36] like this eggs aren't a good thing for
[834.04 - 838.56] any of these symptoms or conditions
[836.36 - 840.96] because what's behind everybody's
[838.56 - 842.04] sickness and behind autoimmune so if
[840.96 - 844.72] you're somebody with any kind of
[842.04 - 848.08] autoimmune what's behind it is viruses
[844.72 - 849.76] so Epstein bar virus shingles virus um
[848.08 - 852.04] all the different viruses that's what's
[849.76 - 854.12] behind autoimmune and they sit inside of
[852.04 - 856.20] us and we get all these symptoms skin
[854.12 - 859.36] conditions and everything so with all
[856.20 - 862.80] that said eggs will feed the bugs so
[859.36 - 864.72] eggs are a bad idea so um I'd keep them
[862.80 - 866.28] out of your diet if I I would listen to
[864.72 - 867.88] the medical medium podcast at Apple
[866.28 - 870.24] podcast and listen to the egg episode
[867.88 - 872.64] your mind will be blown the information
[870.24 - 875.12] in that episode so it's a docy series
[872.64 - 877.92] style podcast it's uh at Apple podcast
[875.12 - 880.96] medical medium so you can check that out
[877.92 - 882.16] so um got a half cup of thinly sliced
[880.96 - 882.96] radishes right here I'm going to pop
[882.16 - 886.20] these
[882.96 - 888.48] in that's what I'm going to
[886.20 - 889.96] do it's one of the options in this
[888.48 - 891.80] recipe see guys I'm making the healing
[889.96 - 894.68] potato salad so I just threw the
[891.80 - 896.92] radishes in there take a look right
[894.68 - 899.40] partially flat or curly you can use
[896.92 - 903.00] Either Ore so I use the flat leaf
[899.40 - 905.48] parsley but you can use um either one
[903.00 - 905.48] perfectly
[906.92 - 911.40] fine so anyway all right so I'm going to
[909.56 - 914.24] do some cucumber too that's that's the
[911.40 - 916.72] next option inside this so thinly half
[914.24 - 918.12] cup of thinly slice cucumber all right
[916.72 - 921.08] what I'm going to do is cut the cucumber
[918.12 - 923.64] in half this is an English cucumber I'm
[921.08 - 925.56] leaving the skin on this one too here's
[923.64 - 927.08] a question from Janette by the way this
[925.56 - 928.72] is an English cucumber I just wanted to
[927.08 - 932.00] show you and I just cut it in half just
[928.72 - 934.48] so you know that's that's it right there
[932.00 - 937.60] um why are so many people sensitive to
[934.48 - 939.88] onions the people who need them stop
[937.60 - 944.16] eating them
[939.88 - 945.60] um so what happens is that a lot of
[944.16 - 947.08] people they'll have a lot of
[945.60 - 948.48] sensitivities because they're dealing
[947.08 - 950.40] with so many different levels of
[948.48 - 951.80] bacteria in their intestinal tract
[950.40 - 953.84] that's one reason too so in their
[951.80 - 956.08] intestinal tract they'll have bacteria
[953.84 - 957.96] strepto octus is one of the bacteria the
[956.08 - 961.12] main bacteria in people's intestinal
[957.96 - 964.12] tract the other one is other ones E coli
[961.12 - 967.36] and if you got a lot of that in there
[964.12 - 969.68] including fungus yeast mold if you got a
[967.36 - 972.32] lot of this inside your intestinal tract
[969.68 - 974.20] you're going to rock the boat because
[972.32 - 977.20] when you put something like onions in
[974.20 - 979.28] onions is like an antiseptic against
[977.20 - 980.96] these very bugs and these microorganisms
[979.28 - 983.12] that aren't great so when you're eating
[980.96 - 985.84] a little bit of that onion some people
[983.12 - 987.28] can get a reaction the reaction is um
[985.84 - 989.08] they feel a little funny in their tummy
[987.28 - 992.20] maybe or they feel like they got got
[989.08 - 994.96] some extra gas that kind of sensitivity
[992.20 - 998.36] um but but really that's that's that's
[994.96 - 998.36] what happens there it feels too
[998.64 - 1004.60] strong does radish give Jacqueline says
[1002.04 - 1006.48] does radish give nutrition I heard
[1004.60 - 1009.08] radish is a
[1006.48 - 1012.04] condiment radishes are an incredible
[1009.08 - 1015.40] food I mean I think I talk about
[1012.04 - 1016.80] it here in life-changing Foods I think I
[1015.40 - 1019.84] talk about it in some of the other books
[1016.80 - 1023.52] too radish is really power ful because
[1019.84 - 1026.56] it's it's got a high sulfur Rich
[1023.52 - 1028.96] phytochemical compound in it and that
[1026.56 - 1032.56] high sulfur Rich pH phytochemical
[1028.96 - 1035.00] compound is is anti-bug and you got to
[1032.56 - 1037.04] think about here's the thing okay
[1035.00 - 1038.52] everybody's sick because they got these
[1037.04 - 1040.72] little bugs inside of them and they got
[1038.52 - 1045.04] toxic heavy metals too and other toxins
[1040.72 - 1047.04] in them and foods have to be detoxifying
[1045.04 - 1050.08] but they also have to be anti-bug
[1047.04 - 1052.92] anti-pathogen antiviral antibacterial
[1050.08 - 1055.08] anti- mold anti- geese anti fungus and
[1052.92 - 1057.32] some foods are stronger than others for
[1055.08 - 1058.88] helping us to heal and radishes that's
[1057.32 - 1061.44] the food right there so I just put some
[1058.88 - 1065.60] radishes in there thinly sliced okay I
[1061.44 - 1067.84] got that so I'm doing the Cucumber now
[1065.60 - 1070.08] thinly slicing some cucumber I'm using
[1067.84 - 1072.32] an English cucumber right here so I'm
[1070.08 - 1075.00] thinly slicing some cucumber going to
[1072.32 - 1078.36] try to do about a half a cup of this I
[1075.00 - 1079.96] like having the Cucumber inside here I
[1078.36 - 1082.44] like the cucumber inside this healing
[1079.96 - 1085.00] potato salad I like the
[1082.44 - 1087.08] radishes and I even have some asparagus
[1085.00 - 1089.48] in front of me too I'm going to put in
[1087.08 - 1091.76] here so I'm trying to get about a half a
[1089.48 - 1093.88] cup I think I got it thinly sliced
[1091.76 - 1096.16] cucumber right here so I'm going to
[1093.88 - 1098.60] sprinkle that about inside this healing
[1096.16 - 1098.60] potato
[1100.28 - 1105.36] salad thanks for being here you guys and
[1102.60 - 1108.16] in my kitchen today this is
[1105.36 - 1111.12] awesome so I got that in there and then
[1108.16 - 1113.88] asparagus steamed or raw I'm going to
[1111.12 - 1117.16] use steamed asparagus in this healing
[1113.88 - 1120.52] potato salad so I got some nice um
[1117.16 - 1124.24] steamed asparagus right here so that's
[1120.52 - 1127.12] this Julianne asks IBS any suggestions
[1124.24 - 1129.80] of what to eat so in cleanse the heel I
[1127.12 - 1132.96] talk about Mono eating so mono eating
[1129.80 - 1134.84] cleanses and cleanse the heel so that's
[1132.96 - 1137.76] what I talk about in here and it's for
[1134.84 - 1141.64] people with gastroparesis IBS Crohn's
[1137.76 - 1145.00] colitis Celiac intestinal bloating
[1141.64 - 1147.24] cramping intal intestinal sensitivities
[1145.00 - 1148.88] and so it's the mono eating cleanse
[1147.24 - 1150.80] inside cleanse to heal it's one of the
[1148.88 - 1151.68] cleanses it's healing people all around
[1150.80 - 1155.56] the world right now with
[1151.68 - 1158.64] gastrointestinal problems so um so an
[1155.56 - 1160.12] IBS is inflammation that is a mystery to
[1158.64 - 1161.84] medical research and science so it's a
[1160.12 - 1163.32] mystery to the doctor it's a mystery to
[1161.84 - 1165.76] medical research and science they don't
[1163.32 - 1167.92] know what IBS is irritable bowel
[1165.76 - 1169.68] syndrome so with all the science and
[1167.92 - 1171.16] technology in the world and all the
[1169.68 - 1173.48] trillions of dollars that went into
[1171.16 - 1175.96] medicine so far all they can come up
[1173.48 - 1178.36] with with three words irritable bowel
[1175.96 - 1180.96] syndrome which means out of all the all
[1178.36 - 1183.84] the medical technology we have they came
[1180.96 - 1186.12] up with the fact that your bow is
[1183.84 - 1188.72] irritable that's all they came out with
[1186.12 - 1191.52] like that's it it's like trillions of
[1188.72 - 1194.92] dollars they can send a rocket ship into
[1191.52 - 1197.60] space um we got the best stereo systems
[1194.92 - 1200.20] in our cars now but all they can come up
[1197.60 - 1202.20] with with IBS is it's irritable so
[1200.20 - 1204.00] you're irritable that's it so you got an
[1202.20 - 1205.40] irritable problem in your gut that's all
[1204.00 - 1207.80] they can come up with it when you really
[1205.40 - 1212.48] size it up and see how stupid it is and
[1207.80 - 1214.08] see how actually crazy it is and when
[1212.48 - 1216.24] you actually look at the truth of things
[1214.08 - 1218.68] and see where technology is and and the
[1216.24 - 1221.08] medical world is it's it's remedial it's
[1218.68 - 1222.52] really sad sure you get into a car
[1221.08 - 1224.16] accident they try to piece you back
[1222.52 - 1225.68] together in the hospital and and keep
[1224.16 - 1229.00] you alive and try to put your broken
[1225.68 - 1231.08] bones together but you know and Sur too
[1229.00 - 1232.56] your gallbladder is about to pop they'll
[1231.08 - 1235.08] take it out for you but when it comes
[1232.56 - 1237.40] down to so many things when it comes
[1235.08 - 1239.20] down to all these mystery illnesses and
[1237.40 - 1240.88] autoimmune and and hundreds of
[1239.20 - 1243.32] autoimmune conditions they've labeled
[1240.88 - 1244.76] now they don't know the cause and they
[1243.32 - 1246.52] don't know the cause of celiac they
[1244.76 - 1248.16] don't know the cause of anything
[1246.52 - 1252.76] gastroparesis they just don't know the
[1248.16 - 1255.44] cause so it so with IBS it's
[1252.76 - 1257.60] inflammation yeah but it's inflammation
[1255.44 - 1260.40] from Little buggies that are inside the
[1257.60 - 1262.00] intestinal tract so and little buggies
[1260.40 - 1264.36] cause a lot of problems and then what
[1262.00 - 1267.68] happens is when you eat gluten and when
[1264.36 - 1269.36] you eat dairy products it could make IBS
[1267.68 - 1271.00] worse even if it doesn't make it worse
[1269.36 - 1273.16] that day it could make it worse a week
[1271.00 - 1274.80] later and then then you kind of don't
[1273.16 - 1277.68] know what did it you kind of don't know
[1274.80 - 1281.24] what's going on so if I had IBS I'd be
[1277.68 - 1283.80] off gluten I'd be off dairy products I'd
[1281.24 - 1286.60] be off um milk cheese butter I wouldn't
[1283.80 - 1288.60] be doing that I'd be off eggs I would be
[1286.60 - 1290.92] off all that that's what I would do and
[1288.60 - 1294.00] and then then I would learn hey what's
[1290.92 - 1296.88] the cause of IBS so I would try to find
[1294.00 - 1298.88] out the cause of IBS and then learn how
[1296.88 - 1300.80] to heal it so that's cleanse the heel
[1298.88 - 1302.60] right there if you see it I know it's
[1300.80 - 1304.84] kind of shiny on the screen so that's
[1302.60 - 1306.80] cleanse the heel I have IBS in the book
[1304.84 - 1309.72] you could take it to your doctor if you
[1306.80 - 1313.12] want have them look at it um so I got
[1309.72 - 1314.68] some asparagus right here so half cup of
[1313.12 - 1317.28] chopped asparagus now I'm just going to
[1314.68 - 1321.52] chop this asparagus

[1321.52 - 1326.08] diced I'm not going
[1323.16 - 1327.60] to like overdo it with chopping them up

[1388.08 - 1393.60] tablespoons of um lemon is what I'm
[1391.88 - 1395.20] going to put in here you can put less
[1393.60 - 1398.00] you you could put
[1395.20 - 1399.60] more so um but I'm going to put a couple
[1398.00 - 1401.40] other things let let's put some mustard
[1399.60 - 1403.96] powder in here a half teaspoon of

[1410.72 - 1415.92] a half teaspoon of mustard powder over
[1413.80 - 1419.20] here there we
[1415.92 - 1422.00] go I'm going to do some uh some other
[1419.20 - 1425.36] stuff so two teaspoons of lemon is what
[1422.00 - 1426.84] I'm going to do so about two teaspoons
[1425.36 - 1428.28] so you can do a couple things you can
[1426.84 - 1429.76] use the measuring I'm going to squeeze
[1428.28 - 1432.88] the
[1429.76 - 1435.84] lemon and gauge it that way for me I've
[1432.88 - 1438.40] done it so many times over the years I'm
[1435.84 - 1442.00] going to get about 2 tpoon of lemon
[1438.40 - 1442.00] lemon juice on here is what I'm going to
[1442.84 - 1446.20] do there we
[1446.76 - 1452.16] go a lemon seed went in and I'm going to
[1449.60 - 1454.96] grab that lemon seed real quick get it
[1452.16 - 1457.24] out don't you hate what that
[1454.96 - 1459.88] happens what if you have a sulfur
[1457.24 - 1462.04] allergy sulfur allergy is different than
[1459.88 - 1466.04] what's in a radish so that's not the
[1462.04 - 1467.80] same sulfur so the sulfur um for for
[1466.04 - 1469.84] sulfur allergy is a whole different
[1467.80 - 1471.04] chemical a whole different element it's
[1469.84 - 1475.32] a whole different compound it's a
[1471.04 - 1478.72] different chemical compound um this is
[1475.32 - 1482.76] this we're made out of sulfur we're made
[1478.72 - 1485.24] out of sulfur from plant material like
[1482.76 - 1487.56] we're made out of sulf that's what's in
[1485.24 - 1490.68] all vegetables that's what's in all
[1487.56 - 1493.16] fruit all herbs I'm drinking some
[1490.68 - 1495.32] traditional medicinal tea right now so
[1493.16 - 1498.64] I'm drinking some tea I got some nettle
[1495.32 - 1500.32] leaf tea in the moment okay and um
[1498.64 - 1502.12] there's sulfur in the nettle Leaf so
[1500.32 - 1504.36] whatever herb you've ever had you know
[1502.12 - 1506.84] have you had lemon bomb nettle Leaf
[1504.36 - 1510.36] peppermint Peppermint's got sulfur in it
[1506.84 - 1512.92] it's it's it's the fundamental basis of
[1510.36 - 1515.16] life so that's not the same sulfur
[1512.92 - 1517.72] chemical compounds that you'd be
[1515.16 - 1519.20] allergic to um that's a whole different
[1517.72 - 1520.96] that's a whole different kind of thing
[1519.20 - 1522.20] this is something that's in food
[1520.96 - 1525.44] entirely
[1522.20 - 1527.64] different um so if you've been told that
[1525.44 - 1528.84] you're allergic to a vegetable or a
[1527.64 - 1530.16] radish
[1528.84 - 1531.96] that can happen out there well they'll
[1530.16 - 1534.08] tell you you know you get testing for
[1531.96 - 1537.24] food testing it's totally messed up it's
[1534.08 - 1539.48] totally backwards in so many ways and
[1537.24 - 1541.32] the problem is with all those tests is
[1539.48 - 1543.08] whoever created them doesn't know why
[1541.32 - 1544.84] anybody's sick so here we go we're going
[1543.08 - 1546.60] to tell somebody don't eat the radish
[1544.84 - 1548.88] don't eat this don't eat a strawberry
[1546.60 - 1550.64] don't eat an apple don't eat cilantro
[1548.88 - 1552.80] don't eat this this this don't have
[1550.64 - 1554.44] asparagus you know you're sensitive to
[1552.80 - 1556.80] asparagus they'll say on the test don't
[1554.44 - 1558.68] have cucumber knock that off the test
[1556.80 - 1560.08] don't have lemon that's bad you and
[1558.68 - 1562.24] they'll do this thing where now you're
[1560.08 - 1564.32] just stuck with some meat and some
[1562.24 - 1566.00] chicken and then they'll give you
[1564.32 - 1568.76] something odd to eat like you'll be able
[1566.00 - 1570.88] to eat like uh you'll be able to eat
[1568.76 - 1572.60] like a zucchini or something they'll
[1570.88 - 1574.52] give you like a few things to eat and
[1572.60 - 1577.28] now you're totally stuck you're like you
[1574.52 - 1581.00] have 50 things they say you're you know
[1577.28 - 1584.04] you're sensitive to and meanwhile these
[1581.00 - 1585.64] foods are the foods that are helping you
[1584.04 - 1587.40] heal a problem that they're not
[1585.64 - 1588.76] detecting and that happens with food
[1587.40 - 1590.36] allergy testing
[1588.76 - 1592.60] food sensitivity testing now it's
[1590.36 - 1594.76] different if you're really allergic
[1592.60 - 1596.92] where you eat an asparagus and now you
[1594.76 - 1598.96] can't breathe or something and your
[1596.92 - 1601.76] throat closes well then you're allergic
[1598.96 - 1605.20] to an asparagus pressing Prince hey good
[1601.76 - 1606.84] to see you um you love to eat radishes
[1605.20 - 1609.88] and you love eating their leaves too in
[1606.84 - 1611.64] salads incredible incredible yeah I the
[1609.88 - 1613.84] radish leaves are really healing in
[1611.64 - 1615.48] salads too you put those in your salads
[1613.84 - 1616.80] that's an amazing thing to do so I got
[1615.48 - 1620.16] the lemon in there so I want to put a
[1616.80 - 1620.16] little garlic
[1620.44 - 1626.20] powder um but here's the thing you know
[1623.72 - 1628.52] what what people don't realize is that
[1626.20 - 1630.48] people don't realize is that you don't
[1628.52 - 1632.80] when you don't know why someone's sick
[1630.48 - 1634.28] it's easy to just mess things up so you
[1632.80 - 1636.96] tell somebody hey you're allergic to
[1634.28 - 1638.16] these 20 Foods you're allergic to celery
[1636.96 - 1640.72] you're allergic to Strawberry you're
[1638.16 - 1641.92] allergic to Apple and you tell and it's
[1640.72 - 1643.88] like what you don't even know why
[1641.92 - 1648.68] they're sick you don't even know what's
[1643.88 - 1650.68] wrong with them um you know it's it's
[1648.68 - 1653.52] it's when it's a rash they don't even
[1650.68 - 1655.96] know what causes a r here's the thing if
[1653.52 - 1658.20] you eat a food that you're really
[1655.96 - 1661.20] allergic to and you get a rash right
[1658.20 - 1663.36] that second or your stomach gets really
[1661.20 - 1664.76] crazyer funnier T right in that second
[1663.36 - 1667.64] then you might have a sensitivity to
[1664.76 - 1671.40] that food you know but like if it's like
[1667.64 - 1674.56] really really Intense or something but
[1671.40 - 1676.24] other than that you know nothing happens
[1674.56 - 1679.04] you eat a piece of radish and nothing
[1676.24 - 1681.24] happens you know you eat an asparagus
[1679.04 - 1683.56] and nothing happens and even
[1681.24 - 1685.84] then and even then what you know what
[1683.56 - 1688.76] people don't realize is that you know
[1685.84 - 1693.00] rashes like from eczema rashes from
[1688.76 - 1696.68] psoriasis vitiligo rosacea they're viral
[1693.00 - 1700.00] so these are viral things and IBS is
[1696.68 - 1702.16] strepto coctus it's bacterial
[1700.00 - 1703.84] and sometimes you'll eat some foods and
[1702.16 - 1705.52] you're cleaning all that up and you
[1703.84 - 1707.56] might see some rashes come and go but
[1705.52 - 1710.08] that's different that's different than
[1707.56 - 1711.76] eating a strawberry and then your throat
[1710.08 - 1713.80] swells up or something and you break out
[1711.76 - 1715.16] in hives or something that's that's
[1713.80 - 1716.88] different you know it's an entirely
[1715.16 - 1719.64] different thing that's when someone
[1716.88 - 1721.44] actually has a real food allergy or
[1719.64 - 1722.92] something you know when they experience
[1721.44 - 1725.40] it in that very second their throat
[1722.92 - 1728.12] swells up or something and you know like
[1725.40 - 1730.60] with peanuts like with peanuts something
[1728.12 - 1733.92] like that so um other than that I know
[1730.60 - 1736.96] that so many people they don't have food
[1733.92 - 1738.88] allergies to their foods and they're
[1736.96 - 1741.04] just they're just told got to eat them
[1738.88 - 1742.44] so they don't eat a radish they never
[1741.04 - 1744.92] try it they don't eat a piece of
[1742.44 - 1747.84] eggplant they don't have a cucumber they
[1744.92 - 1750.60] don't have anything and um and people
[1747.84 - 1752.04] get hives all the time but it's not from
[1750.60 - 1753.76] the healthy foods they're eating so
[1752.04 - 1755.80] anyway I want to mix this
[1753.76 - 1759.00] up is what I'm going to do so I'm going
[1755.80 - 1759.00] to mix this potato salad
[1759.31 - 1764.40] [Music]
[1762.20 - 1767.04] up lot of people have chemical
[1764.40 - 1768.76] sensitivities out there a lot of people
[1767.04 - 1771.20] have chemical sensitivity because
[1768.76 - 1772.84] they're they got the Epstein bar virus
[1771.20 - 1775.16] they're they got lots of metals in their
[1772.84 - 1777.36] system and between the Epstein bar virus
[1775.16 - 1779.12] and metals that alone can give somebody
[1777.36 - 1781.84] so many chemical sensitivities they
[1779.12 - 1784.40] become sensitive to everything as far as
[1781.84 - 1787.08] chemical wise so that's important to
[1784.40 - 1789.32] know they'll get hives because of
[1787.08 - 1791.20] chemical sensitivities that's really
[1789.32 - 1792.68] important there I just mixed up this

[1873.48 - 1877.12] than that there's conditions there's
[1875.12 - 1879.12] symptoms there's supplements dosages
[1877.12 - 1881.56] there's an angel chapter I added
[1879.12 - 1885.88] additional essential Angels additional
[1881.56 - 1888.32] meditations in here um there's the meal
[1885.88 - 1891.40] plan expanded on that EXP B on the
[1888.32 - 1894.12] 28-day cleanse so seriously this is such
[1891.40 - 1897.36] a powerful book and I talk about the
[1894.12 - 1899.12] pandemic I talk about the plague up like
[1897.36 - 1901.16] updated This Book Like No Other so this
[1899.12 - 1905.04] is really great I put a book inside this
[1901.16 - 1907.36] book so that's awesome and then look
[1905.04 - 1909.24] cleanse the heel 75 recipes in cleanse
[1907.36 - 1911.32] the heel it's a medical textbook so you
[1909.24 - 1913.32] got these options so they're there for
[1911.32 - 1915.12] you that's that's the whole point but
[1913.32 - 1918.44] I'm excited about the potato salad it's
[1915.12 - 1920.60] going to be delicious
[1918.44 - 1922.68] so Karen says what book do you recommend
[1920.60 - 1924.16] for chemical sensitivities I recommend
[1922.68 - 1925.24] cleanse the heel so if I open up cleanse
[1924.16 - 1927.36] the
[1925.24 - 1930.36] heel right
[1927.36 - 1930.36] here
[1932.36 - 1937.48] um so if I open up cleanse the heel I
[1935.72 - 1939.08] don't know if you can see this but it's
[1937.48 - 1941.20] going to say chemical and food
[1939.08 - 1943.12] sensitivities for some reason the
[1941.20 - 1946.24] lighting is doing something weird
[1943.12 - 1948.00] today um chemical and food sensitivities
[1946.24 - 1949.52] and I talk about the true cause of
[1948.00 - 1951.60] chemical sensitivities the true cause of
[1949.52 - 1953.96] food sensitivities and I talk about what
[1951.60 - 1955.48] to do for it everything I mean this book
[1953.96 - 1957.28] right here just has that right in here
[1955.48 - 1960.24] it's over 200 symptoms and conditions in
[1957.28 - 1966.48] this book so I'm excited about
[1960.24 - 1969.40] this um so this is a recipe that's
[1966.48 - 1971.52] helpful for the digestion it's it's easy
[1969.40 - 1973.60] on the system there's no fat in this
[1971.52 - 1976.04] recipe so it's important to know not to
[1973.60 - 1978.40] put oil in your potato salad in this
[1976.04 - 1980.44] recipe don't put oil in there there
[1978.40 - 1982.64] don't put nut Butters in there don't
[1980.44 - 1984.64] throw Chicken in there has nothing to do
[1982.64 - 1986.64] whether if I like animal protein or I
[1984.64 - 1987.84] like vegan diets or animal protein diets
[1986.64 - 1990.24] has nothing to do with that it's just
[1987.84 - 1994.00] this recipe is meant to help heal the
[1990.24 - 1995.92] liver help you gently cleanse out toxins
[1994.00 - 2000.64] and poisons keep you strong so it's a
[1995.92 - 2000.64] really good powerful recipe right there
[2011.60 - 2014.84] I'm reading some questions right here do
[2013.24 - 2016.44] you like mustard powder better than
[2014.84 - 2018.84] using
[2016.44 - 2020.24] mustard well when you use mustard you
[2018.84 - 2022.68] got to remember there's vinegar in there
[2020.24 - 2024.60] so keep that in mind and vinegar is a
[2022.68 - 2027.88] problem so vinegar can really be a
[2024.60 - 2029.52] problem it's it's it's highly agitating
[2027.88 - 2032.28] to the liver it's irritating to the
[2029.52 - 2035.68] liver um and that's a whole another
[2032.28 - 2038.40] story so and mustard pow unless it's a
[2035.68 - 2040.64] mustard recipe for medical medium maybe
[2038.40 - 2043.16] my blog medical mem.com at the blog and
[2040.64 - 2044.88] it's a mustard recipe that's another
[2043.16 - 2047.04] story but mustards out there in the
[2044.88 - 2049.56] little squeezy bottles it's got vinegar
[2047.04 - 2051.36] in there so you got to look out for that
[2049.56 - 2053.40] and that's a big issue I see a question
[2051.36 - 2056.20] here Karen my Eczema is flaring up after
[2053.40 - 2057.84] eight months of 369 is that part of the
[2056.20 - 2061.00] healing process are you doing eight
[2057.84 - 2062.68] months of 369 the whole time is you
[2061.00 - 2063.68] taking breaks what are you eating in
[2062.68 - 2068.32] between
[2063.68 - 2072.68] 369 is it the 369 Advanced or 369
[2068.32 - 2074.40] uh simplified 369 original 369 Advanced
[2072.68 - 2077.52] are you doing the heavy metal detox
[2074.40 - 2080.20] smoothie at all because eczema is caused
[2077.52 - 2082.68] by two things it's caused by the epine
[2080.20 - 2084.60] bar in combination with copper inside
[2082.68 - 2087.88] the liver so that's copper inside the
[2084.60 - 2090.08] liver so are you doing anything to get
[2087.88 - 2092.00] the copper out of the liver because
[2090.08 - 2094.12] until the copper completely comes out of
[2092.00 - 2097.28] the liver then you're free so are you
[2094.12 - 2100.04] doing the heavy metal detox smoothie um
[2097.28 - 2102.08] are you doing any of the antio antiviral
[2100.04 - 2104.92] protocols so when I look at cleanse to
[2102.08 - 2106.92] heel and I look at
[2104.92 - 2108.48] eczema and you can take this to your
[2106.92 - 2111.28] doctor and you can ALS or healthc care
[2108.48 - 2114.00] provider or health coach or whoever's in
[2111.28 - 2115.56] whoever's in charge of your health care
[2114.00 - 2119.04] um you can take this to them but when I
[2115.56 - 2120.96] look into eczema I'm going to find it
[2119.04 - 2124.60] here
[2120.96 - 2126.96] um so exoman psoriasis including rosacea
[2124.60 - 2129.88] lupus style rashes and some other things
[2126.96 - 2131.76] too some in here right now okay um and
[2129.88 - 2133.40] I'm looking I'm seeing supplements and
[2131.76 - 2135.68] dosages
[2133.40 - 2138.56] so some people can get rid of their
[2135.68 - 2140.12] eczema by just doing the 369 after a
[2138.56 - 2142.24] week or two right and their eczema
[2140.12 - 2143.80] starts to clear up some people can get
[2142.24 - 2145.60] rid of their eczema doing the mono
[2143.80 - 2147.52] eating cleanse some people get rid of
[2145.60 - 2149.88] their eczema by just you doing the 28
[2147.52 - 2154.24] day cleanse like like in the medical
[2149.88 - 2156.80] medium book here but it all depends some
[2154.24 - 2159.92] people have more copper inside their
[2156.80 - 2161.88] liver causing the eczema some people end
[2159.92 - 2164.08] up having two or three varieties of
[2161.88 - 2165.80] Epstein bar inside their liver so or
[2164.08 - 2167.40] they'll get exposed and get another
[2165.80 - 2168.96] epsteam bar three years after they got
[2167.40 - 2171.52] their eczema better and then three years
[2168.96 - 2174.20] later they pick up another viral uh a
[2171.52 - 2175.92] viral load and then they're you know
[2174.20 - 2177.80] they they end up getting something else
[2175.92 - 2182.00] but you have to have copper inside the
[2177.80 - 2184.48] liver in order to have eczema and So
[2182.00 - 2187.40] when you buy new clothing brand new
[2184.48 - 2188.20] clothing there's copper in the fungus
[2187.40 - 2189.92] side
[2188.20 - 2192.16] and you know they sell copper clothing
[2189.92 - 2194.72] now right you know copper clothing type
[2192.16 - 2196.56] stuff where they got copper weaved into
[2194.72 - 2198.00] clothing now and stuff like that socks
[2196.56 - 2199.72] and other things and all that highly
[2198.00 - 2203.20] toxic because that's copper that gets in
[2199.72 - 2205.64] our system they um and then fungicides
[2203.20 - 2208.84] pesticides everything scented candles
[2205.64 - 2210.84] have copper in it um air fresheners it
[2208.84 - 2212.56] all depends on your exposures too so I
[2210.84 - 2215.32] talked about so I talked this about a
[2212.56 - 2218.00] doctor recently about ezim and psoriasis
[2215.32 - 2220.40] and people get new exposures too they'll
[2218.00 - 2223.44] get scented candle exposure and then a
[2220.40 - 2225.60] month later they end up getting a flare
[2223.44 - 2227.60] or they'll get air freshener exposure
[2225.60 - 2230.68] and they'll get a flare or cologne
[2227.60 - 2233.04] exposure so perfume in Cologne exposure
[2230.68 - 2234.96] I've seen people order new clothes the
[2233.04 - 2236.56] new clothes come they try them on and
[2234.96 - 2238.48] they got perfume on them from somebody
[2236.56 - 2240.48] else trying them on and all of a sudden
[2238.48 - 2242.72] it flares things up because perfume
[2240.48 - 2244.32] cologne have copper in them copper is a
[2242.72 - 2246.28] heavy metal toxic heavy metal used in
[2244.32 - 2249.28] perfume clones scented candles
[2246.28 - 2251.04] pesticides herbicides fungicides air
[2249.28 - 2252.60] fresheners and everybody should be
[2251.04 - 2254.12] complaining to all these companies
[2252.60 - 2257.56] because we're just they just they're
[2254.12 - 2258.84] just contaminating everybody but so
[2257.56 - 2260.28] there's a couple things you could do you
[2258.84 - 2262.24] can go to your practitioner doctor and
[2260.28 - 2264.00] you can look at the supplements too for
[2262.24 - 2266.00] examon orasis you could be like well am
[2264.00 - 2269.20] I doing all these am I doing some of
[2266.00 - 2270.64] these and so and that's what's in here
[2269.20 - 2273.36] so I don't know if you guys could see
[2270.64 - 2277.84] that it's kind of Whiting out on there
[2273.36 - 2279.52] um but the whole thing is that when you
[2277.84 - 2281.40] look here when you look here you can
[2279.52 - 2283.08] start out with you read the supplement
[2281.40 - 2285.60] chapter in cleans the heel and you can
[2283.08 - 2287.28] read like the information you can try a
[2285.60 - 2288.64] few different supplements for it you can
[2287.28 - 2291.12] go to your practitioner and see if your
[2288.64 - 2293.00] practitioner wants you to try more and
[2291.12 - 2294.92] then it and then you're doing the heavy
[2293.00 - 2296.84] metal detox smoothie too so when you go
[2294.92 - 2300.20] in here there's a heavy metal
[2296.84 - 2303.32] detox um smoothie in here the reason for
[2300.20 - 2305.40] that is to get the copper out so when
[2303.32 - 2308.04] that when it comes down to that you got
[2305.40 - 2309.40] like the vimergy spirulina the barley
[2308.04 - 2311.28] grass cheese powder in the heavy metal
[2309.40 - 2314.72] detox smoothie I talked about that the
[2311.28 - 2318.04] other day and when you get out when you
[2314.72 - 2319.28] get out the copper then you get you get
[2318.04 - 2321.24] you know you move forward you move
[2319.28 - 2323.20] forward and then the supplementations
[2321.24 - 2326.32] for the ant that's the whole antiviral
[2323.20 - 2329.52] thing too but also if you're doing the
[2326.32 - 2330.68] 369 or you doing it how's how's the
[2329.52 - 2332.20] process going like are you doing
[2330.68 - 2334.40] caffeine at all in between it did you
[2332.20 - 2336.72] have chocolate in between chocolate is
[2334.40 - 2338.32] the eczema instigator so if you had
[2336.72 - 2341.64] chocolate a month ago you can end up
[2338.32 - 2343.52] with a cycle of eczema a month later cuz
[2341.64 - 2345.64] it's an instigator because it jacks up
[2343.52 - 2347.44] the adrenals and the adrenals push out
[2345.64 - 2349.56] copper everywhere that's in your liver
[2347.44 - 2351.88] so any kind of caffeine any kind of
[2349.56 - 2354.40] chocolate any kind of tea any kind of
[2351.88 - 2355.48] coffee drinks um these are just some of
[2354.40 - 2356.76] the things are you staying away from
[2355.48 - 2359.56] vinegar are you staying away from
[2356.76 - 2361.48] nutritional yeast uh make sure no eggs
[2359.56 - 2363.56] get in the diet between the 369 and
[2361.48 - 2365.80] maybe you're doing a 369 8 months
[2363.56 - 2367.08] straight and nothing's getting in so you
[2365.80 - 2369.28] got to try some of those other things
[2367.08 - 2370.72] I'm talking about um you can talk to
[2369.28 - 2371.96] your practitioner but I'm trying to give
[2370.72 - 2374.28] you any
[2371.96 - 2376.68] insight um to make sure that you know
[2374.28 - 2379.76] you get every chance to recover like so
[2376.68 - 2381.96] many millions have with exim mons orias
[2379.76 - 2383.96] um or you under a lot of stress stress
[2381.96 - 2386.20] triggers the adrenals when the adrenals
[2383.96 - 2388.40] are flooding the heart rate goes up the
[2386.20 - 2390.12] adrenaline pushes out old storage bins
[2388.40 - 2392.12] of copper deeper out of the liver and
[2390.12 - 2395.16] now you got a little bit of a flare up
[2392.12 - 2397.60] that's how it works so um it just
[2395.16 - 2399.16] happens anyway um but you're in the
[2397.60 - 2400.68] healing process you're doing all the
[2399.16 - 2402.04] right things and you just keep you can
[2400.68 - 2403.72] go further you can go a little bit
[2402.04 - 2405.56] further and that's how it's set up so
