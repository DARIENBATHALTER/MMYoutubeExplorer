1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,860
I'm so blown away at the brain saver

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,319
books

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,019
that I'm reading them going through them

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,519
and it's just mind-boggling how much

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,219
information coming from spiritual

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,480
compassion that just blows my mind

7
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,480
greatest books of all time

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,119
swear to God

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,640
last night

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,160
four bed

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,160
I was praying to God okay and

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,120
was bypassing Spirit of compassion said

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,540
you know I just I gotta do some prayers

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
here and I was saying how grateful I was

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,559
because

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,440
regardless of how much work it was and

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,800
how much work it is and how much

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,260
crap I have to face and take from doing

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,059
it because no one wants the industries

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,300
don't want these books out

21
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,460
that's evident we know that and

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,440
it's incredible to think that this

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,800
information

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,199
came from above and to know people are

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,420
getting instant relief from the from the

26
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,040
brain shot therapies instant relief just

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,619
like Spirit of compassion told me and

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,080
just like instant relief

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,080
it's just something that you just can't

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,240
even imagine to Be Alive In This Moment

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,460
In Time

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,259
to make it this far I didn't think I was

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,080
going to make it I didn't think I was

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,460
going to make it past 12. 12 years old I

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,479
just didn't you know hearing Spirit of

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,860
compassion and then all the

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,439
responsibilities I just didn't think I

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,759
would make it and I think I made it this

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,380
far

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,600
and

41
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,119
with all the gray in my beard and all

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,240
the brain my hair hair the things I made

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,079
made it this far and to actually be able

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,560
to receive that information not lose my

45
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,140
mind doing it

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,240
and put in 20-hour days

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
sacrifice everything I could possibly

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,079
sacrifice

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,360
I didn't shower for three months I mean

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,659
just whatever it's like you just

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,180
I just ate and slept in it right slept

52
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,580
two hours and then worked and ate in it

53
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,120
and just whatever the thing I got this

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,000
far in being able to somehow survive and

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,099

I'm allowed to say it because it's my

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,879
opinion because Spirit of compassion

61
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,180
gave me the information and I could

62
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,099
judge I could judge that information

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,959
and

64
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,580

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,400
fall into four main categories

155
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,520
four main categories

156
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,620
first category

157
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,620
problematic and damaging supplements

158
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,620

and damaging supplements that's one

160
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,840
category right there

161
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,500
second category mildly problematic

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,199

supplements where it's especially

169
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,380
important to seek out high quality forms

170
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,240
because they're frequently produced with

171
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,240
low quality ingredients or problematic

172
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,280

347
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,079

348
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,079

problematic and damaging supplements

357
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,480
let's talk about alkaline ionizer water

358
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,740
machines it's in that category you ready

359
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,560
metal plates inside these machines

360
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:32,100
corrode and oxidize over time

361
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,639
slowly leaching oxidized metal byproduct

362
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,040
and metal nanoparticles into the water

363
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,100
regardless of what brand of machine

364
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,420
regardless of what brand of machine

365
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,760
oxidized metal byproduct and metal

366
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,100
nanoparticles eventually lead to

367
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,760
neurological symptoms

368
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,620
eventually lead to neurological symptoms

369
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,660
alkaline ionizer water machines are not

370
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,199
water purifiers their filtration is

371
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,180
limited water becomes dead water as it's

372
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,920
being deconstructed by the electricity

373
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,560
of these machines the water becomes

374
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,180
foreign to the human body that's number

375
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,680
one on the problematic and damaging

376
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,940
supplements unless they're all bad but

377
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,920
I'm just saying that's number one number

378
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,959
two number three let's move into a

379
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,360
couple of different ones okay

380
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,160
let's go with bentonite clay how many of

381
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,019
you guys been sucked into bentonite clay

382
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,839
that whole thing

383
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,420
that whole thing

384
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
bentonite clay these Clays do not remove

385
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,920
toxic heavy metals they are too harsh

386
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,120
and aggressive on the intestinal tract

387
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,000
lining

388
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,139
they act as sandpaper in your intestinal

389
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,540
tract

390
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,279
Clays irritate sensitive nerves that

391
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,740
connect in and around the intestinal

392
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,300
tract so anybody who has any kind of

393
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,800
condition or symptom at all does the

394
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,480
bentonite clay in the Clays they're

395
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,760
going to totally mess their system all

396
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,579
up like their nerves people with

397
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,560
sensitive or inflamed vagus nerves you

398
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,920
guys vagus nerves should not ingest

399
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,019
Clays educating myself how are you page

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,019
77 finally the explanation for

401
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,740
spontaneous human combustion

402
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,720
I am at your service

403
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,579
I can't take the credit because it's up

404
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,740
there it comes from and I'm a messenger

405
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:12,779
and received it Lisa Marie says years

406
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,639
ago you suggested zeolite so no more and

407
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,399
I've I've explained that explanation

408
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,560
over and over again

409
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,100
the only one that I recommended years

410
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,920
ago okay still wasn't the greatest

411
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,380
but it wasn't as problematic now here's

412
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,899
here's the thing we also didn't have

413
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,459
pure sources of dolls at the time or

414
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,480
other things that were available out

415
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,160
there so I was trying to give people

416
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,100
another little option but here's the

417
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,680
thing the industry changed the zeolite

418
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,899
industry changed zeolites that were

419
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,940
inedible were processed in the same

420
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:48,420
factories as the ones that were edible

421
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,100
the inedible ones tear up your

422
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,800
intestinal lining

423
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,120
boom real bad

424
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,779
so

425
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,860
the world changed I I have my own free

426
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,959
will

427
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,100
but the but what they do they have their

428
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,899
own free will

429
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,480
and they wanna they wanna do what they

430
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,040
want to do the the quality and things

431
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,780
and whatnot and the zeolites that's a

432
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,299
whole nother game I'm just telling you

433
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,380
what happened and so that

434
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,480
cross-contamination was another big part

435
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,360
of it along with other problems too as

436
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,720
everything changed

437
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,720
okay I never said they'd do anything but

438
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,819
help a tiny bit in the intestinal tract

439
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,020
if it's the right one there is no right

440
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,600
one right now

441
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,460
and but zeolites never travel into the

442
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,720
bloodstream and remove Metals out of

443
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,280
your brain they never did it and I never

444
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,080
said they did

445
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,580
okay so let's go a little bit further

446
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,020
here so I want to talk about the Clays a

447
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,880
little bit more get this

448
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,780
Bentonite

449
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,340
The Details Matter by the way

450
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,700
Bentonite Clays can also disrupt

451
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,539
microbiome so anybody taking the claims

452
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,660
and they're worried about their

453
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,620
microbiome they're completely

454
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,120
tearing their microbiome to shreds

455
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,039
Bentonite and other clay suffocate good

456
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,419
bacteria and microorganisms so if you've

457
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,860
got good bacteria in your gut because

458
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,419
it's all about good bacteria in your gut

459
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,620
good bacteria in your guts all you hear

460
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,140
out there well guess what you take the

461
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,900
Bentonite Clays you're gonna

462
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,200
tear up that good bacteria suffocate

463
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,640
them kill them

464
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,100
microorganisms that don't need oxygen

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,840
that does that don't mind being

466
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,880
suffocated or the bad stuff so check

467
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,679
this out

468
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,200
Bentonite and other clay suffocate good

469
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
bacteria and microorganisms and allow

470
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,100
bad bacteria and microorganisms to

471
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,160
thrive because Clays remove oxygen

472
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,419
inside the intestinal tract get ready

473
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,520
mind-blowing information here it goes

474
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,380
way ahead of research in science way

475
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,720
ahead of any anywhere out there I'm just

476
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,880
going to drop this bomb good bacteria

477
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,900
and microorganisms need higher levels of

478
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,900
oxygen to survive

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,980
inside our gut

480
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,980
that oxygen comes from your food

481
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,799
bad bacteria and microorganisms need

482
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,080
lower levels of oxygen to survive Clays

483
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,880
can create a chronic dehydration within

484
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,120
the intestinal tract raising bad

485
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,460
bacteria you take your Clays zeolites of

486
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,380
clay you take your Clays all them and

487
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,160
what happens is you raise your bad

488
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,160
bacteria

489
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,460
I'm not making friends

490
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,440
because it's not about that I have to

491
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,760
have the chronically ill they're back I

492
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,860
have to have their back

493
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,840
I have to look out for them

494
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,280
I noticed that in this world I'm just

495
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,919
going to just tell you right now just

496
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,440
heart to heart for two seconds you guys

497
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,640
would I witness every day and have

498
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,100
is

499
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,960
the people the gurus and all that and

500
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,460
the people in the health movement you

501
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,660
see them out there they're on podcasts

502
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,460
and whatever they're doing all their

503
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,580
thing they're on YouTube doing running

504
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:51,140
ads or whatever it is all those gurus

505
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,140
they're just about making friends

506
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,400
they'll never go the right direction in

507
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,780
the end because they're all about what

508
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,919
friends they got and what friends they

509
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,179
keep they don't care about the

510
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,400
chronically ill

511
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,679
they don't take risks

512
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
they steal and poach when it fits their

513
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,700
they still improach from mm when it fits

514
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,919
their narrative in the moment that they

515
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,720
want to do but they don't care about the

516
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,940
chronic Lil

517
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,100
I'm not about making friends I'm about

518
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,860
making sure you guys have what you need

519
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,380
anything that comes with it whatever

520
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,179
Tara Appleman hey so sad bentonite clay

521
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,039
is one of the first things I tried to

522
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,919
heal my gut needless to say it didn't

523
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,720
help it's it's the first thing that so

524
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,160
many people have tried okay let's go

525
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,140
into another area

526
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,720
I can't read all this there's too much

527
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,620
information in these books you guys 40

528
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,440
off right now at amazon.com 40 off when

529
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,740
I saw it this morning I actually yelped

530
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,179
actually like screamed I was like oh my

531
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,080
God

532
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:55,380
29 for for brand saver

533
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,179
27 for brain saver protocols both books

534
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,700
you need

535
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:03,440
okay let's hit another one

536
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,440
there's so many to choose from

537
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:12,320
let's see let's do a simple one

538
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,320
chlorella everybody chlorella Chlorella

539
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,740
recommended chlorella I saw it online

540
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,720
that's really good for me first of all

541
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,940
it does not bind down to toxic heavy

542
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,240
metals properly

543
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,780
let me make that clear it does not bind

544
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,360
onto toxic heavy metals properly

545
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:37,140
spreads toxic heavy metals into adjacent

546
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,200
tissue chlorella spreads toxic heavy

547
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,940
metals into adjacent tissue inside the

548
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,120
brain that's what it does

549
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:49,220
so let's just keep on eating it

550
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,220
chlorella does not have

551
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,760
oh it says something else here

552
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,559
accelerating brain conditions let me add

553
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,659
that in I'm sorry about that spreads

554
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:00,539
toxic heavy metals into adjacent tissue

555
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:02,340
accelerating brain conditions

556
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,780
I don't want to take chlorella if it's

557
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,780
going to accelerate a brain condition

558
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,880
chlorella does not have the ability to

559
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:14,179
remove toxic heavy metals from the body

560
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,380
chlorella is not antibacterial or

561
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:22,620
anti-viral rather listen to this

562
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,840
ready it often contains bad bacteria

563
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,480
resulting in foodborne illness so okay

564
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,940
let me just buy some chlorella and get

565
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,620
some foodborne illness that's just one

566
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,200
that's a fun one let's try to find

567
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:37,200
another fun oh Pearl powder

568
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,260
has been like Pearl powder Pearl powder

569
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,840
and this here I think this is why I this

570
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,460
is why so many fake stories and slander

571
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,900
and hits and smear attacks happen

572
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,760
towards me

573
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,320
to the point where there's so much of it

574
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,000
flooded out there you just can't get

575
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,280
away from it there's so much made up

576
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,440
crap about me and this is an example

577
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,500
Pearl powder if you have a bunch of

578
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,120
people invested in Pearl powder

579
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,039
and they they're making it their jam

580
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
they're making it their life and then I

581
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,299
come along and I'm like don't do it

582
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,860
Pearl powder because I'm getting the

583
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,919
information from above Pro powder is not

584
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,020
good for you now I have 50 more enemies

585
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,580
online and who knows who they know or

586
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,940
don't and what they spread and what they

587
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:24,419
do because it's just but like I said you

588
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:27,299
can go along the way and make friends

589
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:29,159
and Bank on it too I could come out with

590
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,440
a medical medium Pearl powder and sell

591
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,860
it to all you guys and Bank on a ton of

592
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,539
money and then to all my Pro powder

593
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,340
friends won't be mad at me and they'll

594
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:41,340
all be happy and everybody will be happy

595
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,080
but that's evil so I don't work for evil

596
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,320
there's good there's evil I don't work

597
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,340
for evil so when it comes down to Pearl

598
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,380
powder

599
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,299
I wrote something about it in here well

600
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,760
I got it from Spirit of compassion and I

601
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,679
wrote down in here you ready an irrits

602
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,600
hint that's abrasive to the intestinal

603
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,400
lining serious like my Pearl powder

604
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,500
meanwhile they're getting scratched up

605
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,000
really bad on their intestinal Linings

606
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,400
and it leads to problems and then

607
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,740
they'll blame their celery juice

608
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,960
it irritant that's abrasive to the

609
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,299
intestinal Linings triggering vagus

610
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:15,240
nerves Pearl powder is going to trigger

611
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,620
vagus nerves in people creating problems

612
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,440

638
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,620
uh you know what I'm going to bypass

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:36,860

Pearl powder does not leave the

644
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,880
intestinal tract quickly

645
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,320
it does not leave the intestinal tract

646
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,559
quickly you guys

647
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,840
it accumulates and cakes inside pockets

648
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,059
of the intestinal tract lining so what

649
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,799
it's doing it's caking in the pockets

650
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,580

conditions they're taking Pearl powder

654
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,720
think it's going to make their skin and

655
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,740
their nails and their hair so great

656
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:16,020
and they're tearing apart their

657
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,700
intestinal tract

658
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,380
Pearl powder does not leave the

659
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,940
intestinal dry quickly it accumulates

660
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,740
and cakes inside pockets of the

661
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,840
intestinal tract lining you guys need

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,520
these books just so you can protect

663
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,640
yourself so you don't get swayed into

664
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,640
some direction avoid if you have any

665
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,620
type of intestinal tract disorder

666
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
I don't know but I got like friends

667
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,320
telling me there's a whole bunch of

668
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,760
people using Pro powder out there and

669
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,900
they all got intestinal tract disorders

670
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,640
and they're all complaining it's getting

671
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,340
worse but it's not the pro powder it's

672
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,740
the celery juice right

673
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,600
avoid if you have any type of intestinal

674
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,460
tract problem Pearl powder carries

675
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,159
traces of Mercury

676
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,240
why does Pearl powder carry Mercury do

677
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,299
you guys know

678
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,940
I'm trying to think why would Pearl

679
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:01,500
pearls contain mercury Spirit of

680
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,720
compassion told me this no one's ever

681
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,640
talked about this ever

682
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,200
and when I heard that so I was like okay

683
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,200
Spirits give me what you got

684
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,760
and he's and basically we're saying was

685
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,360
well it's it's mercury in the pearl

686
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,580
powder and I'm like what do you mean

687
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,320
the accumulation of pearl powder on the

688
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,020
intestinal tract lining can eventually

689
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,700
cause bloating due to the powder not

690
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,140
allowing gas to flow through the

691
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,460
intestinal tract properly so what

692
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,520
happens is

693
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,400
you get pockets of gas that stay into

694
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,419
you in in you too long because of pearl

695
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,100
powder

696
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,100
and the Mercury is going to feed God

697
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,120
knows what inside of somebody's gut

698
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,200
streptococcus viruses and everything

699
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,320
else

700
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,299
there's mercury in there duh

701
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,100
okay so let's see let's see if we can

702
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,840

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,960

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,200
engine somewhere or an ionizer a water

744
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,240
machine user who works in there and it's

745
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,399
just like screw that guy I'm gonna try

748
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,100

749
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,539
okay let's look look a little bit more

750
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,100
let's do some okay fish oil and krill

751
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,140
oil I'm gonna read that one for a moment

752
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,299
because so many people are on krill oil

753
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,460
and it's almost like just they're just

754
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,899
all on krill oil right it's everywhere

755
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,919
and you you see people that are supposed

756
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,840
to be so so like

757
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,140
um really intelligent in the health

758
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,460
world right they got big websites and

759
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,720
they're selling lots of stuff they put

760
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,760
articles out all the time they're

761
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,520
doctors they're practitioners or they're

762
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,020
just big influencers or authors and

763
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,159
they're all into krill oil and you see

764
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,140
them and you're like wait a minute

765
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,940
you're supposed to be really smart I

766
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,460
mean you don't know by now

767
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,559
from medical medium information contains

768
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,380
okay so fish oil and krill oil contains

769
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,480
a homeopathic version of mercury so

770
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,700
krill oil contains a homeopathic version

771
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,020
of mercury the essence of mercury but

772
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,480
get this

773
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,580
left over after Mercury removal from

774
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,220
many fish oils allowing methyl Mercury

775
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,039
to enter the brain easily accelerating

776
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,899
brain diseases most fish oils are

777
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,700
manufactured with unwanted fish

778
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,320
by-product and waste from various

779
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,659
varieties of fish brought to the

780
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,220
processing centers and mixed matched

781
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,220
together during the oil extraction

782
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,080
process one fish oil capsule can be

783
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,080
filled with fish oil that was derived

784
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,020
from dozens of fishes

785
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,279
when a fish dies the okay

786
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,320
ready

787
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,480
you want to hear a mind-blowing line

788
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,279
there's a mind-blowing line in every

789
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,720
line in these two books but you want to

790
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,520
hear a really mind-blowing line that

791
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,679
like it's just crazy when I even think

792
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,779
about it when I even read it

793
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:27,179
get ready for this

794
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,360
I mean legendary just unique original

795
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:33,120
information from above

796
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,580
when a fish dies the Mercury and other

797
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,120
toxic heavy metals oxidize and expand

798
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,220
more quickly in the dying fish oil

799
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,179
Who would know that research and science

800
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,779
doesn't

801
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,779
due to gases being produced because the

802
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:50,700
fish is decomposing

803
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:52,380
so when the fish dies and it's

804
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,620
decomposing

805
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,980
the Mercury becomes more dangerous in

806
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,980
the fish

807
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,919
this is why it's much safer to eat a

808
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,399
fish than to take a fish oil supplement

809
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,500
you would never eat as much oil eating a

810
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,260
piece of fish as you would concentrated

811
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,020
into a fish oil capsule I mean that's

812
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:19,080
just incredible right educating myself

813
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,000
again says the whole book is

814
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,440

chronic illness

843
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,919
uh really

844
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,419
the hormones in Deer Antler disrupt

845
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,340
naturally produced and occurring

846
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,840
hormones in the body so we're all about

847
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,760
hormones right every though everything

848
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,320

853
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:56,940
but the hormones in Deer Antler disrupt

854
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,860
naturally produced and occurring

855
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,539

864
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,899
the endocrine system occurs so you take

865
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,879

supplements the more interference with

874
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,859
the endocrine system occurs the higher

875
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,540
the dosage and the longer the dosage is

876
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:51,419
taken so somebody's like I take a deer

877
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:54,359
antler for 10 years

878
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:56,099
the more withdrawal can occur eventually

879
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,800
causing adrenal fatigue and hair loss

880
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:01,260
then the person loses all their hair

881
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,040
and they get the adrenal fatigue Shauna

882
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,780

right here I was the first to publish

889

the cause of multiple sclerosis then

890
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,079
Harvard took it seven years later

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,500
the true cause of multiple sclerosis and

893
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,660
then Harbor took medical medium

894
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,839
information and published it seven years

895
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,839
later

896
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,880

the light blast we're not doing the

930
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,400
light blast right now that's the that's

931
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,020
the light infusion meditation that's in

932
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,380
the brain saver books that we were just

933
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,380
talking about

934
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,760
but I'm honored about the light blast

935
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,560
which we will get to for sure

936
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,560
not today but we will

937
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,920

so many people are on turpentine oil

939
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,680
it's you know Scorch is the intestinal

940
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,680
tract linings

941
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,660

link

949
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,940
turpentine oil scorches the intestinal

950
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
tract Linings killing off more good

951
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,680
bacteria and microorganisms than bad

952
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,480
bacteria and microorganisms

953
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,339
you're killing off the good stuff when

954
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,780
you take the turpentine oil

955
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,780
you're killing the good stuff

956
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,260
when entering the bloodstream when

957
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,940
turpentine oil and enters the

958
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,339
bloodstream

959
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,900
you're raising blood toxicity

960
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:15,180
not good

961
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,640
which stresses and intoxicates the liver

962
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,280
and brain turpentine oil has a very high

963
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,800
astringency factor that almost brings it

964
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,260
to a solvent level when you're taking

965
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,359
turpentine oil you're actually almost

966
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,579
bringing your blood toxicity to a

967
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,280
solvent level which is not good for the

968
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:36,599
brain I don't know I do not correct

969
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,980
English do not recommend turpentine oil

970
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,980
maybe we can do another one

971
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:45,960

972
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:48,180

for a long C

1001
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,240
honestly the brain saver books is is

1002
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,400
probably where I would start for long C

1003
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,099
you've got medical medium new New

1004
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,359
Edition revised I was the first to

1005
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:20,880
publish with the cause of long C was

1006
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,680
so the pers first the publish and guess

1007
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,400
what you guys and then science research

1008
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,900
took it after the fact didn't cite me I

1009
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,700
can't they come up with their own stuff

1010
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,800
and stop taking and stealing and

1011
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,320
poaching medical medium information did

1012
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,560

1056
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,180
I just want to forewarn you I know

1057
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,520
there's a few people that got really

1058
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,740
upset about the alien podcast because it

1059
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,200
scared them and that medical meme

1060
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,119
information is positive and it has all

1061
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,480
this healing information and then here I

1062
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,599
come out with this big old alien podcast

1063
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,420
episode and I come out with this big old

1064
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,160
alien just two-hour podcast episode and

1065
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,940
I tell my story of what happened to me

1066
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,160
when I was younger and with

1067
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,260
the extraterrestrials and you know when

1068
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,660
I and I talked about that and then I

1069
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,619
talked about things about how things

1070
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:46,320
work or could work or if

1071
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:48,180
and I know a lot of I know a few people

1072
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,060
got really upset with the alien podcast

1073
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,060
and I could only just say that

1074
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,060
um

1075
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,920
that alien podcast

1076
00:42:56,339 --> 00:43:01,380
is the first of many I'm just not gonna

1077
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,180
come out with the next one yet

1078
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,720
I am going to come out with another

1079
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,220
alien podcast episode I'm just but but I

1080
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,599
should have not said anything because

1081
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,839
it's not going to be for quite a while

1082
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,700
we have a lot of brain episodes I have

1083
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,480
to do so

1084
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,480
all right

1085
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,099
whey protein powder it feeds everything

1086
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:25,079
bad accelerating symptoms and conditions

1087
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:26,940
whey protein powder is inflammatory

1088
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,099
because it fuels pathogens that create

1089
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,960
inflammation so you go to the doctor and

1090
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,520
you're like at the you're at the

1091
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,319
functional medicine doctor specialist

1092
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,300
and he's like your inflammatory markers

1093
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,819
are up we don't know what you got lime

1094
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,619
or what or gene mutation we don't know

1095
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:41,880
what's going on but your inflammatory

1096
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,060
markers are up we don't know if you have

1097
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,920
ra or lupus or whatever you got

1098
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,680
make sure you take your whey protein

1099
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,660
powder the whey protein powder will up

1100
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,579
the inflammation because it's feeding

1101
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,140
pathogens that the functional medicine

1102
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,780
doctor doesn't even know that exists in

1103
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,400
your system whey protein is not a useful

1104
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,319
source of protein because it doesn't

1105
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,640
break down inside our stomachs in small

1106
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,380
intestinal tracts Who would know that

1107
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,980
Spirit of compassion

1108
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,440
naturally human produced hydrochloric

1109
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,359
acid does not dismantle the Whey Protein

1110
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,980
sore bodies can't utilize it so when you

1111
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,540
put whey protein powder in you guess

1112
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:19,079
what it rots

1113
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,780
whey protein rots in your gut your HCL

1114
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:24,000
can't break it down it can't do anything

1115
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,560
about it so when you do whey protein

1116
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,260
powder just so you know I hope this

1117
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:30,839
doesn't all fall apart on me right here

1118
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,660
if you do whey protein powder

1119
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:34,859
your hydrochloric acid your stomach

1120
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,960
lands

1121
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:41,119
you're not going to be able to break it

1122
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,119
down it can't be utilized or taken apart

1123
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,720
let's talk about the brain shot therapy

1124
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,000
a little bit you guys

1125
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,540
if anybody on here is

1126
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,400
breezing through and you see these books

1127
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,079
just know

1128
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,460
when you read them you'll know they're

1129
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,859
the greatest books of all time Natural

1130
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,900
Health and any health book you ever go

1131
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:03,480
to that's not MediCal medium but you

1132
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,260
ever go to after that will never touch

1133
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,880
it

1134
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,760
there won't be there isn't a health book

1135
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,560
out there they eat better doctors

1136
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,500
that put out books

1137
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,720
nothing can touch these books I could

1138
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,240
say it with confidence maybe I need the

1139
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,160
ego shifter maybe my ego got out of

1140
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,440
control and my ego's all big now and I

1141
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,960
need the ego shifter in the books

1142
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,940
but the point is

1143
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,800
is that they're that good and I can

1144
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,480
judge them because the information comes

1145
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,220
from above so I have every right to make

1146
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,079
a judgment call myself my judgment call

1147
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,180
is they're the greatest books of all

1148
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,740
time for for the for chronic illness for

1149
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,079
the future of neurological problems and

1150
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,119
brain issues all of the above and what

1151
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,579
you'll notice is once you're in here you

1152
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,780
can't go back to the others like not

1153
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,400
MediCal meeting books those you can

1154
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:49,920
always go to cleanse the heel is epic

1155
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,079
but the point is and has healed so many

1156
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,540
people but the point is is when you go

1157
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,940
back to other health books that come out

1158
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,740
other diet books or health books and

1159
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,560
things like that and you go to that and

1160
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,720
then you go to here or you go to here

1161
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,079
into that and then you'll know

1162
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,640

the Comets are so tiny and they go up so

1506
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,059

1527
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,980
happening because of the book released

1528
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:49,799
so I have a opposing imposter that's

1529
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,260
what it is not a poser an imposter

1530
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:54,660
problem happening right now the

1531
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,920
imposters are doing terrible things like

1532
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,380
they're saying things they're doing

1533
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,319
things they're making fake consultations

1534
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,579
like I'm Anthony William and I and it's

1535
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:05,700
been a problem for the last few years

1536
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:08,760
but it's been really bad lately and

1537
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,220
there's people who've been wronged by

1538
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:15,420
The Imposter

1539
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:17,579
and they're spreading information that's

1540
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,079
trying to destroy my credibility I mean

1541
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:21,960
they're not probably doing it on purpose

1542
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:25,740
but they're just so they're so hurt by

1543
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:28,619
The Imposter that they're then trying to

1544
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,420
warn others that that medical medium

1545
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,780
Anthony William guy that Anthony William

1546
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:36,119
Guy is a bad guy

1547

1548
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:40,440
imposters are doing like doing

1549
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,540
consultations taking people's money or

1577
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,280
amazing or if you just bought the book

1578
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,059
and you want to go to Amazon and leave a

1579
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,859
review

1580
01:02:45,059 --> 01:02:50,420
and I want to show you how you can clean

1581
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:50,420
the books one more thing

1582
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,859
so

1583
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,660
at Amazon when you order a book and it

1584
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:59,099
could be other other

1585
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,200
um places too

1586
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:03,900
when you order a book they have conveyor

1587
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,880
belts so anytime you place an order your

1588
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,500
order goes on a conveyor belt so what

1589
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,640
happens is somebody takes a book off the

1590
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,799
shelf

1591
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,660
they got an order take the book off the

1592
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:14,160
shelf medical medium someone just

1593
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,200
ordered the medical mean book throw it

1594
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,839
on the conveyor belt

1595
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,180
the conveyor belt's got grease on it by

1596
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:25,079
the time the book heads down the

1597
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:27,540
conveyor belt the book can be just

1598
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:29,400
greasy everywhere

1599
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:33,420
you open it up

1600
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,760
aw gave me a used book how dare he

1601
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,339
why would he do this if your book is

1602
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:41,460
tattered or injured or destroyed

1603
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:43,140
just tell Amazon and get a replacement

1604
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,839
the other thing is

1605
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:47,760
if it's just dirty and you want to do

1606
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,640
something about you can clean it just

1607
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,020
get a little bit of water

1608
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,299
right here

1609
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:56,460
put a little bit of dish soap on top too

1610
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:57,180
a little bit of dish soap right here we

1611
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,880
go

1612
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:02,520
and then you can give your cover a nice

1613
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,740
clean and get that grease off you can

1614
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,940
even use a handy wipe let's see if I

1615
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:07,440
have one

1616
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,640
I don't think I have one right here but

1617
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,799
that's okay you can use a handy wipe

1618
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,960
and clean it up

1619
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:17,819
come out nice and clean you'll be so

1620
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:19,859
happy

1621
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:22,500
educating myself says the reviews need

1622
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:23,339
10 stars and they don't have 10 Stars

1623
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,319
though

1624
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:27,480

1625
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:30,059

01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,859
much sense I will try to

1635
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,740
I'll try to scramble my brain up and try

1636
01:04:52,859 --> 01:04:59,000
not to make so much sense

1637
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,000
I was always late

1638
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,440
medical medium info makes so much sense

1639
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,480
but it's not common sense

1640
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,520
medical medium information is not common

1641
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,319
sense because it's not common it's all

1642
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,000
unique original comes from above nobody

1643
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,680

medical meme information is not common

1648
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,940
sense it makes sense

1649
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,940
it makes sense

1650
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,700
it's intricate information detailed and

1651
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:34,980

01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:47,160
one health book series in the world for

1657
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:51,420
eight years running now

1658
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,220
I will place my dummy Stomach back in

1659
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,140
we can talk about all kinds of stuff

1660
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:57,960
stomachs everything else hopefully it's

1661
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,940
gut stay in right there no don't fall

1662
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,799
out

1663
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:04,200
I'm just in a good mood to you guys

1664
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:06,299
because the reason why is because this

1665
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,020
marks a time in history

1666
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:11,940
and

1667
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:13,500
you know maybe a big part of the world

1668
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:15,780
will never know about it

1669
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,099
and that's okay it's not okay because I

1670
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,660
want people who are suffering to heal

1671
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:21,119
but

1672
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:23,040
I gotta live with it if however it's

1673
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,839
going to be

1674
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,579
but I'll tell you this is that this

1675
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:28,579
marks a very special moment in history

1676
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:34,680
and can I just say

1677
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:37,819
authors don't put out two massive books

1678
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,819
on the same day

1679
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:44,339
my publisher said uh

1680
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,339
uh he might be the first

1681
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:49,559
who's crazy enough to have two

1682
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:52,619
release on the same day

1683
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:54,299
well Spirit has that much information so

1684
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:58,220
there was nothing

1685
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:58,220
we can do we had to do it

1686
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:03,240

1687
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,160
appreciate you to you guys I really do

1688
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,579
Jackie B says you're the only one who

1689
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,579
makes sense

1690
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,520
can you tell Dr Nesbitt that because I

1691
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,500
swear he thinks I don't make a lick a

1692
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:19,680
sense and

1693
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,660
he said I have to go to school someday I

1694
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,819
have to go to college someday he wants

1695
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,000
me to go to a university and get college

1696
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:28,579
educated I told him that I'm not a smart

1697
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,160
guy

1698
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:36,980

1699
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,980
the words and I write them down

1700
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:41,280
it's not an easy process but I'm just

1701
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:44,400

and

1766
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,040
just so you know when you open up these

1767
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,739
books you'll feel it they're living

1768
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,900

1769
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:16,320
