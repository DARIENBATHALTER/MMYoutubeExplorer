[0.20 - 4.48] hello I'm Anthony William and you're
[2.48 - 6.76] listening to the medical medium radio
[4.48 - 10.24] show where each week I talk about the
[6.76 - 12.72] most advanced healing information and
[10.24 - 16.12] secrets about health much of which is
[12.72 - 19.00] not found anywhere else and is decades
[16.12 - 23.00] ahead of what's out there now and as
[19.00 - 26.64] I've always said who has had 10 or 20 30
[23.00 - 28.80] years to wait or waste away or lose or
[26.64 - 30.88] four years to lose or 5 years to lose I
[28.80 - 32.72] know I say this a lot but it's that
[30.88 - 35.56] serious where when we're sick and we're
[32.72 - 37.04] not feeling good waiting for answers
[35.56 - 41.24] could feel like it's
[37.04 - 44.16] forever and most importantly waiting for
[41.24 - 47.56] real information to what's causing our
[44.16 - 50.60] problems to what's causing our Agony you
[47.56 - 52.56] know real information on what's wrong
[50.60 - 55.40] and and that's a big part of it you know
[52.56 - 58.04] I run into people all the time you guys
[55.40 - 60.28] that they just want to know what's
[58.04 - 62.40] what's the deal you know what's really
[60.28 - 65.56] going on in their body cuzz when you
[62.40 - 67.68] don't know what's going on in your body
[65.56 - 72.00] you you can be lost you can feel really
[67.68 - 74.00] lost so when you think about that that's
[72.00 - 77.92] serious stuff we're talking about that's
[74.00 - 81.56] really serious not knowing what's wrong
[77.92 - 84.00] inside or inside our body makes things a
[81.56 - 86.12] lot harder with healing it makes things
[84.00 - 89.12] really difficult in healing it makes
[86.12 - 91.04] things complicated it makes things a
[89.12 - 92.80] little bit more you know challenging in
[91.04 - 96.72] many different Avenues emotionally
[92.80 - 100.04] physically mentally um for both families
[96.72 - 101.48] and for someone's own you know being too
[100.04 - 104.20] but the families around them they're
[101.48 - 105.88] friends and you know what happens is
[104.20 - 107.36] when we get sick and maybe you've
[105.88 - 109.64] experienced this
[107.36 - 112.00] before maybe you've you've you've had
[109.64 - 115.28] this happen before but you have some
[112.00 - 117.88] friends and you get sick and you you'll
[115.28 - 119.52] lose a couple of friends meaning meaning
[117.88 - 122.68] they just kind of don't really want to
[119.52 - 125.36] be friends much more because they're
[122.68 - 126.68] kind of tired of everybody being sick or
[125.36 - 128.44] they're tired of you being sick or
[126.68 - 131.40] they're tired they're having troubles
[128.44 - 134.24] with that they're it's not easy for
[131.40 - 136.60] them and you know friends we thought
[134.24 - 139.36] were our friends are not our friends
[136.60 - 141.40] anymore but then we find new friends we
[139.36 - 143.24] find new friends along the way you know
[141.40 - 145.36] we do find new friends that actually you
[143.24 - 148.04] know see a different you know
[145.36 - 151.48] understanding and under you know see
[148.04 - 153.24] things differently and um and you know
[151.48 - 155.72] one of the reasons why it's so so hard
[153.24 - 157.44] on also with having sicknesses and
[155.72 - 159.64] illnesses and having friends and family
[157.44 - 162.28] and and you know because when we don't
[159.64 - 165.20] know what's wrong or what's causing the
[162.28 - 167.08] symptom and then you know I've seen
[165.20 - 168.56] people they I've seen people come to me
[167.08 - 171.36] and say look my friend doesn't even
[168.56 - 174.28] believe me anymore um I saw something on
[171.36 - 176.12] a television show just recently too um
[174.28 - 178.84] where you know this person had
[176.12 - 180.60] rheumatoid arthritis and was running to
[178.84 - 184.64] doctor to doctor
[180.60 - 187.88] but then she was also um you know she
[184.64 - 191.88] was also kind of looking healthy she
[187.88 - 193.48] looked healthy she looked fine and her
[191.88 - 195.36] friends were starting to say Hey you
[193.48 - 198.16] know I I don't even get it anymore you
[195.36 - 200.76] look fine everything looks good are you
[198.16 - 203.00] just kind of like is this kind of a game
[200.76 - 207.12] and it really hurt the person's feelings
[203.00 - 209.24] with ra with rheumatoid arthritis and
[207.12 - 210.28] you know to be kind of insulted to that
[209.24 - 212.64] level
[210.28 - 214.44] and look maybe you've look maybe you've
[212.64 - 217.72] known somebody maybe you've done this to
[214.44 - 221.00] someone where someone was years ago and
[217.72 - 223.24] somebody was sick and you know and that
[221.00 - 224.96] happened and you and you and you you
[223.24 - 229.20] know thought somebody was kind of Faking
[224.96 - 230.92] It faking it um so you know it it's It
[229.20 - 232.56] Maybe not maybe somebody did it to you
[230.92 - 235.00] I've seen it happen over the years I've
[232.56 - 238.08] talked to a lot of people and a big part
[235.00 - 240.20] of this is the no answers just there's
[238.08 - 242.36] no answers
[240.20 - 244.44] and they're really not out there we get
[242.36 - 248.16] some diagnoses we get some labels but
[244.44 - 250.16] the answers really aren't there and
[248.16 - 251.84] that's what makes it so hard for for
[250.16 - 253.56] everybody that's sick and then knowing
[251.84 - 255.80] what connects to what like what's
[253.56 - 258.04] causing those symptoms what's causing
[255.80 - 261.56] those problems and then if you can't see
[258.04 - 264.20] the illness you really can't see it if
[261.56 - 266.36] it's not blatantly in front of you then
[264.20 - 268.92] you know people say well you look fine
[266.36 - 271.32] well you look good maybe you're just you
[268.92 - 273.20] know looking for attention oh maybe
[271.32 - 276.04] that's Sally just looking for attention
[273.20 - 278.96] maybe that's um you know maybe you're
[276.04 - 280.80] just maybe you're overreacting you know
[278.96 - 283.08] I've had people say to people I got
[280.80 - 285.60] aches and pains too I got problems too I
[283.08 - 287.48] got this you don't see me complaining
[285.60 - 289.76] you know there's there's so much going
[287.48 - 291.00] on out there but but here's the deal
[289.76 - 294.96] when you know what's causing your
[291.00 - 296.72] problems when you learn what's behind
[294.96 - 298.52] your illness and what's connecting the
[296.72 - 299.92] dots and the pieces of the puzzle and
[298.52 - 302.40] you know what they really are are and
[299.92 - 304.16] you're not lost on the internet and
[302.40 - 306.44] you're not lost out there looking for
[304.16 - 308.08] things and when you when you find these
[306.44 - 309.64] answers it makes a world of a diff
[308.08 - 311.92] difference and that's what the medical
[309.64 - 313.52] medium shows about who's got 10 years
[311.92 - 315.56] who's got 20 years to wait for this
[313.52 - 317.52] these answers no we want to we want to
[315.56 - 320.92] get down to it and we want it we want
[317.52 - 322.16] those answers now and it's important for
[320.92 - 323.52] our children it's important for our
[322.16 - 326.16] grandchildren it's important for the
[323.52 - 328.32] loved ones that we've lost you know it's
[326.16 - 330.12] important for the you know four four
[328.32 - 333.56] fathers and four mothers of the
[330.12 - 337.08] past it it's in it's important for all
[333.56 - 340.96] of these reasons and so we're on it
[337.08 - 345.12] Today's show today's show is about the
[340.96 - 347.28] brain about the brain okay and you know
[345.12 - 349.72] how to keep our brains healthy in a
[347.28 - 352.92] world where we're having brain problems
[349.72 - 355.84] and lots of brain problems how to keep
[352.92 - 358.96] our brains from
[355.84 - 362.28] shrinking how to keep our brains from
[358.96 - 364.88] shrinking ining how about that one huh
[362.28 - 368.16] yeah our brains shrink and when they
[364.88 - 372.76] shrink we lose brain cells we lose brain
[368.16 - 375.16] mass we lose you know we lose our brains
[372.76 - 377.24] and then how about this one how to keep
[375.16 - 380.04] our brains from
[377.24 - 382.64] swelling okay how to keep our brains
[380.04 - 385.04] from swelling that's another thing
[382.64 - 386.76] that's a big deal that's called brain
[385.04 - 388.40] inflammation all right that's called
[386.76 - 390.60] brain
[388.40 - 393.72] inflammation so we got two problems in
[390.60 - 395.12] the world we're getting inflamed brains
[393.72 - 399.32] causing lots of
[395.12 - 402.12] symptoms and we're getting brains that
[399.32 - 404.28] are shrinking so we're going into this
[402.12 - 406.44] heavy there's no question about it you
[404.28 - 408.72] guys check out my life changing Foods
[406.44 - 410.24] book I know I probably sound like a
[408.72 - 412.48] broken record but I'm not going to let
[410.24 - 414.28] you down if you're disappointed with
[412.48 - 415.96] this book I'll be I'll be probably

[428.60 - 432.56] on Facebook I saw recently on Facebook
[431.08 - 434.28] someone like well wait a minute what
[432.56 - 437.76] does this book what is this
[434.28 - 440.44] life-changing Foods book have in it that
[437.76 - 442.84] the first medical medium Bible doesn't
[440.44 - 444.84] have in it you know how can what is this
[442.84 - 447.96] going to be is this a throwaway recipe
[444.84 - 450.08] book is this a a cute little add-on book
[447.96 - 452.08] no this thing is passed
[450.08 - 455.84] and it's when I'm talking about over 700
[452.08 - 458.08] illnesses and and symptoms and diseases
[455.84 - 460.28] okay how to connect the dots what foods
[458.08 - 462.60] help information that doesn't exist
[460.28 - 466.28] anywhere else on wild Foods herbs and
[462.60 - 468.24] spices on vegetables on fruits how to
[466.28 - 472.52] protect yourself from the unforgiving
[468.24 - 474.88] for the unforgiving for that everybody
[472.52 - 477.96] ignores that's destroying our lives
[474.88 - 479.92] making us sick that's making us decline
[477.96 - 482.12] everybody's ignoring it the trends and
[479.92 - 484.24] the fads are ignoring it you know all
[482.12 - 486.24] the fads and different Trends they're
[484.24 - 488.28] you know they're all the you know the
[486.24 - 490.72] hip you know books out there hip
[488.28 - 492.32] information hip internet information all
[490.72 - 495.12] ignoring it because they don't know
[492.32 - 498.28] about the unforgiving for it's in this
[495.12 - 500.00] book I can't say it enough try to try to
[498.28 - 502.00] lo you know try to grab yourself a copy
[500.00 - 504.00] Lo meaning get your name on a copy
[502.00 - 505.44] before it even comes out so you don't
[504.00 - 506.72] have to wait forever and it's out of
[505.44 - 507.88] stock and all that stuff like what
[506.72 - 509.40] happened with the medical medium
[507.88 - 511.80] original book and this one I think will
[509.40 - 513.84] be worse in that in that department so
[511.80 - 516.24] anyway listen let's talk about the brain
[513.84 - 517.92] I'm I'm here I'm I'm with you now I just
[516.24 - 521.72] want you to fast in the seat bels for
[517.92 - 523.68] this this ride and um because and we're
[521.72 - 525.48] we're hitting a rocket ship on this one
[523.68 - 527.84] well I mean we're in a rocket ship on
[525.48 - 531.04] this one um so you know take a deep
[527.84 - 534.28] breath and relax and uh take another
[531.04 - 536.80] deep breath after that and then relax
[534.28 - 540.48] cuz we're about to take off and you want
[536.80 - 544.04] to be slightly Calm before we take off
[540.48 - 546.96] so brain shrinking what the heck am I
[544.04 - 550.40] talking about with brain shrinking what
[546.96 - 552.56] am I talking about okay well brain
[550.40 - 556.44] shrinking is the
[552.56 - 560.76] loss of carbohydrates in the brain the
[556.44 - 565.44] loss of carbohydrates in the
[560.76 - 570.68] brain yes yeah the loss of glycogen in
[565.44 - 573.72] your brain and we get older we lose
[570.68 - 576.28] glycogen storage in our brain what is
[573.72 - 578.16] that what is glycogen sto do you know
[576.28 - 581.00] what glycogen storage is you probably
[578.16 - 585.16] somebody probably does out there what is
[581.00 - 587.20] glycogen storage and glycogen storage is
[585.16 - 590.16] sugar the loss of
[587.20 - 595.24] sugar imagine that the loss of sugar in
[590.16 - 597.24] our brain okay so why is that important
[595.24 - 600.76] like why why should we care sugar
[597.24 - 602.92] Sugar's bad Sugar's bad for you wait a
[600.76 - 604.92] minute it's all about fat now no lots of
[602.92 - 606.64] fat no protein it's all about protein
[604.92 - 610.28] protein protein which is basically lots
[606.64 - 611.40] of fat protein and that's all that we
[610.28 - 614.28] care about
[611.40 - 617.76] nowadays well all that does is Fast
[614.28 - 619.52] Track us to to a brain that shrinks more
[617.76 - 621.32] and to a more unhealthier brain and to
[619.52 - 623.60] brain diseases and Alzheimer's and
[621.32 - 629.52] Dementia and everything around brain
[623.60 - 635.68] diseases we know today so the brain is
[629.52 - 638.60] made out of this dense amount of
[635.68 - 642.00] carbohydrates that have like that have t
[638.60 - 644.04] it's a carbohydrate ball of it basically
[642.00 - 646.00] because carbohydrates is one of the keys
[644.04 - 648.36] to conducting
[646.00 - 650.48] electricity it's one of the keys of
[648.36 - 654.88] cooling down the
[650.48 - 658.84] engine see our brains get hot they get
[654.88 - 661.80] hot and you have to have sugar to cool
[658.84 - 664.72] them down you got to have carbohydrates
[661.80 - 666.44] to cool down the brain now I'm sure some
[664.72 - 668.08] of you are out there saying okay this is
[666.44 - 670.52] this is bull
[668.08 - 672.08] crap this is bull because he's talking
[670.52 - 673.52] about sugar Sugar's bad for you what's
[672.08 - 676.96] he talking about I'm not talking about
[673.52 - 680.64] corn syrup I'm not talking about I'm not
[676.96 - 682.16] talking about table sugar I'm not
[680.64 - 684.72] talking about chocolate cake I'm not
[682.16 - 687.72] talking about chocolate donuts I'm not
[684.72 - 690.56] talking about powdered Donuts here's the
[687.72 - 692.04] deal okay we're not talking about that
[690.56 - 693.52] we're not talking about that kind of
[692.04 - 696.52] sugar and you got to know this I just
[693.52 - 698.20] got to make sure that that gets across
[696.52 - 700.56] because I know a few of you are going to
[698.20 - 704.28] be already peed
[700.56 - 708.96] off you're going to be already upset and
[704.28 - 711.16] frustrated but the brain is made out of
[708.96 - 713.76] sugar and there's a little bit of fat in
[711.16 - 716.32] the brain not a lot the brain doesn't
[713.76 - 720.32] have a lot of fat at all in it very
[716.32 - 722.60] little micro micro micro
[720.32 - 724.12] small micro
[722.60 - 728.24] small
[724.12 - 729.56] literally like we're talking like less
[728.24 - 733.88] than
[729.56 - 739.16] 10% and the fat that's in the brain is
[733.88 - 741.92] just highly highly rare rare oils that
[739.16 - 746.88] the body practically
[741.92 - 750.48] produces and we receive from Foods rare
[746.88 - 753.28] oils it's not what runs the brain it's
[750.48 - 754.60] just a fraction of brain health so right
[753.28 - 756.32] now you're going to hear about Omega-3s
[754.60 - 757.92] you're going to hear about Omas fish
[756.32 - 761.48] oils oh it's for the brain it's all the
[757.92 - 763.24] brain outdated outdated outdated go to
[761.48 - 765.00] the Antique sh shop I've been saying
[763.24 - 766.60] that too many times lately someone told
[765.00 - 769.08] me the other day I think my assistant
[766.60 - 770.92] said to me said you got to stop throwing
[769.08 - 774.96] the antique thing out at
[770.92 - 776.68] everybody I can't help it because you're
[774.96 - 778.08] shopping for antiques with the
[776.68 - 779.60] information that's brand new off the
[778.08 - 781.36] press right now and brain health and
[779.60 - 783.60] everything else around it I don't care
[781.36 - 786.04] what came out two years ago what came
[783.60 - 788.80] out one year ago what's coming out next
[786.04 - 791.36] year if it doesn't say your brain is
[788.80 - 792.56] made out of 90% carbohydrates that's
[791.36 - 795.68] part of it we're going to cover some of
[792.56 - 798.08] the rest of it and then a small
[795.68 - 801.56] percentage a small
[798.08 - 805.36] percentage of things like squalene and
[801.56 - 807.44] things like omegas re you know DHA EPA
[805.36 - 809.36] but on a small
[807.44 - 811.72] fraction okay
[809.36 - 815.16] and that that very little fat and then
[811.72 - 817.24] the rest the rest is
[815.16 - 820.52] minerals
[817.24 - 822.52] minerals and of course there's cells and
[820.52 - 824.56] neurons and they're there too you got
[822.52 - 827.44] your gal cells you got your neurons
[824.56 - 832.16] those are there too they're all wrapped
[827.44 - 834.76] in and around lots of stored glycogen
[832.16 - 836.88] that was built up when you were a baby
[834.76 - 840.92] in the womb from your
[836.88 - 845.48] mommy eating anything that had sugar in
[840.92 - 848.08] it anything that had sugar in it when a
[845.48 - 852.24] mom goes carb free
[848.08 - 855.08] pregnant the baby the baby's brain
[852.24 - 857.20] suffers when a mom goes carb-free
[855.08 - 858.72] pregnant and one of the one of the
[857.20 - 860.92] greatest mistakes in the world is
[858.72 - 863.32] lowering carbs with a
[860.92 - 866.44] pregnancy okay so we got to make sure
[863.32 - 869.00] your carbs are up it's very important
[866.44 - 870.64] because that initial storage you're not
[869.00 - 871.88] hear you're not hear this from anywhere
[870.64 - 873.44] this isn't good you're not going to hear
[871.88 - 875.24] this stuff from anywhere this is why
[873.44 - 877.92] we're here at the medical Medium show
[875.24 - 879.72] this is why Spirits giving us this
[877.92 - 881.92] information so we can protect ourselves
[879.72 - 884.64] and our family and move forward and heal
[881.92 - 886.84] I don't want anybody in the dark anymore
[884.64 - 889.72] and you know what happens is those
[886.84 - 892.20] critical storage bins of carbohydrates
[889.72 - 895.56] that mommy's eating while pregnant
[892.20 - 899.32] becomes the backbone to brain
[895.56 - 903.16] tissue becomes reserves car carbohydrate
[899.32 - 905.92] reserves glycogen storages to make the
[903.16 - 909.60] brain grow and
[905.92 - 913.20] become and so we start with that and we
[909.60 - 915.76] keep that it's it's
[913.20 - 918.80] imperative so our brain is mostly
[915.76 - 920.60] comprised of a sugar and runs on sugar
[918.80 - 921.88] it runs on sugar you know what you know
[920.60 - 924.36] how I pick on medical research and
[921.88 - 927.20] medical science a lot and you know and I
[924.36 - 928.44] don't mean in um heart transplants and I
[927.20 - 930.40] don't mean in broken legs and I don't
[928.44 - 933.12] mean when you need a great surgeon
[930.40 - 936.52] surgeons are you know gifted incredible
[933.12 - 938.20] gifted men and women on the planet um
[936.52 - 939.68] and and you know when we need them we
[938.20 - 941.16] need them when things happen to us we
[939.68 - 942.52] need them when we go through all
[941.16 - 943.88] different kinds of crises like your
[942.52 - 945.80] gallbladder explodes because you weren't
[943.88 - 949.32] taking care of your gallbladder for 30
[945.80 - 951.16] years um you know that kind of thing um
[949.32 - 953.32] aneurysm in the brain you know we need a
[951.16 - 955.40] brain we need a brain surgeon with Rob
[953.32 - 957.08] you know with robots with a robot that
[955.40 - 959.44] go in there and literally remove an
[957.08 - 961.36] aneurysm and
[959.44 - 962.52] and I got tremendous respect for doctors
[961.36 - 964.08] and practitioners I'm talking about
[962.52 - 965.48] medical re research it's science that
[964.08 - 967.08] doesn't understand chronic illness one
[965.48 - 971.68] bit on any
[967.08 - 972.84] level and what happens here is that um
[971.68 - 974.68] with medical research and medical
[972.84 - 976.04] science there was a great discovery and
[974.68 - 977.24] you know I'm always picking on research
[976.04 - 978.80] and science but there was a great
[977.24 - 981.28] discovery that the brain ran on
[978.80 - 982.20] sugar you focus on just protein and fats
[981.28 - 983.56] and you starve your body of
[982.20 - 985.76] carbohydrates your brain will shrink and
[983.56 - 987.28] it'll shrink faster sure you may not
[985.76 - 989.60] notice it when you're 30 years old and
[987.28 - 991.16] your your low carb and you're exercising
[989.60 - 992.84] you're low carb and you're 30 years old
[991.16 - 994.08] you're not going to notice it you'll
[992.84 - 996.24] notice it when it hits you when you're
[994.08 - 999.44] 60 for what you did when you were 30
[996.24 - 1001.60] it's that imperative that we have
[999.44 - 1003.40] carbohydrates and before anybody else
[1001.60 - 1005.28] gets upset at me hold back your rotten
[1003.40 - 1007.00] tomatoes and your potatoes and the rocks
[1005.28 - 1009.36] that you want to probably Stone me to
[1007.00 - 1011.24] death with for for people who just don't
[1009.36 - 1013.40] like this topic because it's it's
[1011.24 - 1015.16] controversial uh and I'm on your side
[1013.40 - 1017.28] without I get it contral stuff can just
[1015.16 - 1019.96] you know get anybody upset but before
[1017.28 - 1022.12] you you know before you throw a Stone
[1019.96 - 1024.12] you know you you have to understand that
[1022.12 - 1026.08] I'm also not talking about bad
[1024.12 - 1028.32] carbohydrates I'm not talking about you
[1026.08 - 1030.08] know wheat I'm not talking about wheat
[1028.32 - 1031.88] gluten I you know well glutens are
[1030.08 - 1033.52] proteins but I'm not talking about wheat
[1031.88 - 1035.16] I'm not talking about bad bad
[1033.52 - 1040.40] carbohydrates okay I'm not talking about
[1035.16 - 1041.92] corn and um so so basically the first
[1040.40 - 1043.28] understanding is what the brain's made
[1041.92 - 1044.84] out of because if you don't know what
[1043.28 - 1046.12] you're made out of then guess what
[1044.84 - 1047.40] you're not going to do the right things
[1046.12 - 1048.96] and guess what we're not going to take
[1047.40 - 1052.28] care of our brain and guess what we're
[1048.96 - 1053.44] totally going to be you know messed up
[1052.28 - 1054.84] from it or we're going to cheat
[1053.44 - 1057.20] ourselves out of something we're going
[1054.84 - 1062.08] to lose out we're going to lose out I
[1057.20 - 1064.52] don't want anybody losing out so um so
[1062.08 - 1067.68] we got to get into this a little bit so
[1064.52 - 1069.44] electricity runs hot our brains run hot
[1067.68 - 1071.96] when we go through trouble when we have
[1069.44 - 1074.64] problems in our lives our brains heat up
[1071.96 - 1076.44] anxiety heats up the brain stress heats
[1074.64 - 1079.88] up the
[1076.44 - 1082.36] brain you can't be carb free while under
[1079.88 - 1084.76] stress you will dissolve I've seen
[1082.36 - 1086.80] people do it they dissolve they're like
[1084.76 - 1089.24] a puddle they just dissolve and they
[1086.80 - 1093.16] melt you carbs are critical for the
[1089.24 - 1095.84] brain to keep the brain cool and
[1093.16 - 1097.08] calm now it is true that there are some
[1095.84 - 1100.32] essential oils that I'm talking about
[1097.08 - 1101.96] not essential oils but essential omegas
[1100.32 - 1104.96] that are critical for the brain and
[1101.96 - 1110.24] brain health you know like pumpkin seed
[1104.96 - 1112.44] oil okay hemp seed oil um you know that
[1110.24 - 1115.12] kind of thing it is important because it
[1112.44 - 1117.84] does comprise of part of the brain but
[1115.12 - 1120.40] but that isn't what runs the whole
[1117.84 - 1122.48] machine that's what I'm talking
[1120.40 - 1123.92] about so to keep our brains from
[1122.48 - 1125.76] shrinking as we get older so we don't
[1123.92 - 1128.04] get all kinds of diseases and brain
[1125.76 - 1130.48] diseases and memory loss and everything
[1128.04 - 1134.60] else we got to make sure we have
[1130.48 - 1137.40] glycogen storage banks in the brain
[1134.60 - 1139.28] keeping that tissue good so that's the
[1137.40 - 1142.92] first thing to understand so what that
[1139.28 - 1145.72] means is sweet potatoes it means regular
[1142.92 - 1147.92] potato it means and at wait and before
[1145.72 - 1150.32] you pick on me about potato being a
[1147.92 - 1153.16] white food it's not a white food it's
[1150.32 - 1154.60] not a white food you guys it's not I
[1153.16 - 1157.00] know everybody's not saying anything I'm
[1154.60 - 1158.32] just saying I I I feel someone's out
[1157.00 - 1162.60] there saying he's talking about a white
[1158.32 - 1165.04] food now someone new on listening in is
[1162.60 - 1168.80] saying he's talking about a white food
[1165.04 - 1170.52] now hang on hang on okay
[1168.80 - 1172.48] the skin of the food determines if it's
[1170.52 - 1174.92] a white food or not you got a red
[1172.48 - 1176.48] skinned potato you got a red food you
[1174.92 - 1178.76] got a purple skinned potato you got a
[1176.48 - 1180.56] purple food you got a brown skinned
[1178.76 - 1183.48] potato you got a brown
[1180.56 - 1187.00] food you you have a you know a gold
[1183.48 - 1189.92] skinned potato you got a gold
[1187.00 - 1191.72] food okay you cut it open and you got
[1189.92 - 1193.64] white inside but that's not processed
[1191.72 - 1195.96] that's a whole food loaded with minerals
[1193.64 - 1198.28] and vitamins lyine to stop viruses and
[1195.96 - 1200.64] diseases that's what's in a potato okay
[1198.28 - 1202.28] okay you take a cultivated blueberry
[1200.64 - 1203.76] which I don't like by the way I don't
[1202.28 - 1205.56] like cultivated blueberries I mean they
[1203.76 - 1207.72] they got Health to them they're healthy
[1205.56 - 1209.52] but it's the Frozen wild blueberry that
[1207.72 - 1211.12] holds all the power but just let's move
[1209.52 - 1213.20] over the the Frozen wild blueberry
[1211.12 - 1216.28] because when you open up a FL Frozen
[1213.20 - 1218.04] wild blueberry it's blue
[1216.28 - 1221.44] inside it's
[1218.04 - 1224.56] blue like blue like real blue like real
[1221.44 - 1226.44] blue you open up a big cultivated round
[1224.56 - 1227.88] uh cultivated blueberry in the clamshell
[1226.44 - 1229.84] you pick up the fresh blueberries in the
[1227.88 - 1232.76] clam shell you open that up it's white
[1229.84 - 1233.96] inside want to call that a white food
[1232.76 - 1235.56] let's call that a white food if you're
[1233.96 - 1236.68] going to call a potato a white food
[1235.56 - 1238.04] you're your blueberry that you're
[1236.68 - 1240.68] probably throwing in your smoothie let's
[1238.04 - 1242.08] call that a white food it's not a white
[1240.68 - 1244.72] food it's a blue food even the
[1242.08 - 1246.52] cultivated blueberry is a blue food
[1244.72 - 1248.72] let's talk about a radish let's cut open
[1246.52 - 1250.32] a radish it's white inside it's a red
[1248.72 - 1252.28] food and purple food depending if it's a
[1250.32 - 1253.60] purple radish or red radish and the
[1252.28 - 1254.96] potato is the same way it's not a white
[1253.60 - 1257.64] food this is another mistake I'm
[1254.96 - 1259.68] clearing up as we run into these as we
[1257.64 - 1261.96] need food foods for ourselves I have to
[1259.68 - 1262.92] clear up some of these trendy mistakes
[1261.96 - 1265.20] and
[1262.92 - 1266.36] misconceptions for you guys because
[1265.20 - 1268.84] there's so many of them they're like
[1266.36 - 1272.44] landmines that poison our ground they're
[1268.84 - 1275.48] like like landmines that are there to De
[1272.44 - 1279.16] you know to literally you know basically
[1275.48 - 1280.68] detonate and knock us off our tracks and
[1279.16 - 1282.60] this is part of why people don't heal
[1280.68 - 1284.28] every one of these counts it's why we're
[1282.60 - 1285.96] that's why spirit and I when I say we're
[1284.28 - 1287.80] spirit and I are loading these things up
[1285.96 - 1289.64] in our books this book coming out life
[1287.80 - 1291.52] Chang ing Foods we need to have the
[1289.64 - 1293.48] information the medical meaning book we
[1291.52 - 1295.60] need to have it out here we can't be
[1293.48 - 1299.36] doing this anymore we got to make sure
[1295.60 - 1301.44] everybody has that so brain shrinking is
[1299.36 - 1303.24] when we lose our carbohydrate reserves
[1301.44 - 1307.28] our brain squee you know they squeeze
[1303.24 - 1311.48] down and they shrink all right brain
[1307.28 - 1313.04] swelling brain swelling is mild en
[1311.48 - 1315.72] sephtis that's not
[1313.04 - 1317.52] diagnosed from viruses that's what
[1315.72 - 1319.72] people with Lyme disease get people with
[1317.52 - 1322.84] multiple SC osis get people with ala get
[1319.72 - 1325.32] I mean ALS get people with um all these
[1322.84 - 1326.80] different problems and their brains they
[1325.32 - 1328.96] get swelling in different parts of their
[1326.80 - 1331.36] brain it's hard to pick up on CAT scans
[1328.96 - 1332.64] you can't pick it up on MRIs and you get
[1331.36 - 1335.00] brain
[1332.64 - 1336.64] inflammation and so that's something
[1335.00 - 1340.88] that's caused by
[1336.64 - 1342.64] viruses viruses such as um you know hhv6
[1340.88 - 1345.20] viruses such as shingles different
[1342.64 - 1347.48] varieties of shingles um even different
[1345.20 - 1351.40] varieties of Epstein bar can do it you
[1347.48 - 1354.92] know V is actually in cause inflammation
[1351.40 - 1358.96] in the brain because the nervous system
[1354.92 - 1361.80] is inflamed from neurotoxins so
[1358.96 - 1363.40] neurotoxins neurotoxins are pro produced
[1361.80 - 1365.44] by viruses they float around in the
[1363.40 - 1368.00] bloodstream they get into the brain and
[1365.44 - 1370.72] they give us brain fog memory loss all
[1368.00 - 1372.04] kinds of problems they give us migraines
[1370.72 - 1373.88] they make us susceptible they give us
[1372.04 - 1376.12] SES and pains they hurt our eyes they
[1373.88 - 1379.36] give us all kinds of weird stuff in the
[1376.12 - 1382.44] brain and those are neurotoxins from
[1379.36 - 1384.32] viral debris and stuff and then we have
[1382.44 - 1385.84] heavy metals lots of heavy metals in our
[1384.32 - 1387.36] brains and we got to get the heavy
[1385.84 - 1388.88] metals out we got to get the viral
[1387.36 - 1390.24] toxins out that are floating around in
[1388.88 - 1392.76] the body we got to get that out of the
[1390.24 - 1394.76] brain got to get the heavy metals out so
[1392.76 - 1398.76] listen you know because we we don't have
[1394.76 - 1400.48] a a ton of time today you just make sure
[1398.76 - 1403.60] you know you do the heavy metal detox
[1400.48 - 1405.00] that I talk about um check that out the
[1403.60 - 1407.32] heavy metal detox it's in the first
[1405.00 - 1409.80] medical medium book and you get the
[1407.32 - 1411.12] metals at of your brain and we'll talk
[1409.80 - 1413.76] about some foods you know to kind of
[1411.12 - 1417.28] help that along as a little later on uh
[1413.76 - 1419.24] today with this with this um Talk um so
[1417.28 - 1420.80] we want to make sure we get those Metals
[1419.24 - 1423.20] out of our brain too so it's a whole
[1420.80 - 1425.60] another thing Mercury lead cadmium
[1423.20 - 1427.84] arsenic copper our brains are filled
[1425.60 - 1428.88] with copper a lot of times you know
[1427.84 - 1431.92] that's a whole another thing there's
[1428.88 - 1433.80] copper everywhere which reminds me if
[1431.92 - 1434.96] you're somebody that is afraid to take
[1433.80 - 1437.36] zinc because you're going to lose your
[1434.96 - 1438.36] copper storage that's another trendy
[1437.36 - 1441.20] mistake that's it's another
[1438.36 - 1443.76] misconception that's out there first of
[1441.20 - 1446.44] all we're loaded with hard copper all of
[1443.76 - 1448.40] us are loaded with hard copper okay it's
[1446.44 - 1450.76] in our livers it's in our brains people
[1448.40 - 1453.92] with examen psoriasis have way more in
[1450.76 - 1458.16] their liver with Co copper but it's in
[1453.92 - 1460.16] us and the only way to get it out is to
[1458.16 - 1461.88] do things to take out heavy metals like
[1460.16 - 1464.52] like in the book I talk about the barley
[1461.88 - 1467.88] grass the wild blueberries the spirulina
[1464.52 - 1471.88] the cilantro and the dols and that helps
[1467.88 - 1476.52] get it out but understand that when you
[1471.88 - 1478.96] take zinc zinc won't remove the mineral
[1476.52 - 1482.12] copper that we have the precious mineral
[1478.96 - 1485.16] copper that we have in our body that we
[1482.12 - 1488.52] use the zinc a high quality zinc only
[1485.16 - 1492.12] removes if at best hard copper the stuff
[1488.52 - 1495.20] we're loaded with and food is has tons
[1492.12 - 1497.48] of copper in it both the mineral
[1495.20 - 1500.20] itself you know the trace mineral itself
[1497.48 - 1501.80] copper and both the bad copper you know
[1500.20 - 1503.52] on different foods if it's or if it's
[1501.80 - 1506.52] conventional produce bad copper is going
[1503.52 - 1508.40] to be on it if it's um not not
[1506.52 - 1510.80] traditional produce if it's conventional
[1508.40 - 1512.80] produce if it's organic it'll still have
[1510.80 - 1516.00] the mineral copper in it because it's
[1512.80 - 1517.16] it's plentiful in our soils zinc doesn't
[1516.00 - 1519.80] exist
[1517.16 - 1521.92] anymore it doesn't it doesn't exist
[1519.80 - 1524.28] anymore it's not even in pumpkin seeds
[1521.92 - 1526.12] barely anymore so we need our zinc
[1524.28 - 1528.60] supplements it helps us with the brain
[1526.12 - 1532.00] health it helps us with everything
[1528.60 - 1535.08] it helps it helps keate bad metals like
[1532.00 - 1536.36] the copper out of us the bad copper so
[1535.08 - 1538.84] don't be afraid to taking a little bit
[1536.36 - 1541.56] of zinc so you just want to clear that
[1538.84 - 1543.80] up so our
[1541.56 - 1545.92] brains okay let me tell you something
[1543.80 - 1549.04] about it and I talked about this before
[1545.92 - 1551.72] in in a in um in another podcast in
[1549.04 - 1553.04] another radio show I talked about it and
[1551.72 - 1555.48] our brains
[1553.04 - 1557.44] actually if there are people out there
[1555.48 - 1561.24] that eat brain they eat sheep brain cow
[1557.44 - 1562.56] brain brain goat brain lamb brain
[1561.24 - 1564.68] there's people out there eating brains
[1562.56 - 1566.64] out there I don't recommend it I don't
[1564.68 - 1569.48] at all I I don't like the brain eating
[1566.64 - 1572.48] thing I just can't get I can't wrap my I
[1569.48 - 1575.56] can't wrap my head around it I can't
[1572.48 - 1578.52] wrap my head around that all right no uh
[1575.56 - 1580.52] no pun intended and you know and the
[1578.52 - 1582.00] bottom line is is that when people do
[1580.52 - 1584.80] eat brains in different countries
[1582.00 - 1587.24] including here and you know like rabbit
[1584.80 - 1589.64] brain that's that's pretty common here
[1587.24 - 1591.88] rabbit brain that there's a lot of
[1589.64 - 1593.76] people eating in the US they're eating
[1591.88 - 1595.40] you know they eat the the brain out of
[1593.76 - 1598.40] the rabbit they have the rabbit stewing
[1595.40 - 1599.92] in a stew you know afterwards you just
[1598.40 - 1601.00] you know kind of crack the head open a
[1599.92 - 1602.64] little bit and they take the rabbit
[1601.00 - 1604.44] brain I'm just I'm just telling you guys
[1602.64 - 1606.44] it's very common in the US it's it's a
[1604.44 - 1607.56] staple in a lot of different communities
[1606.44 - 1611.40] here's the
[1607.56 - 1615.24] deal um the brain is sweet it's sweet
[1611.40 - 1617.32] like a sugar pudding it's sweet because
[1615.24 - 1619.00] it's got so much carbohydrate in there
[1617.32 - 1622.08] so so let's go into the carbohydrate
[1619.00 - 1624.80] thing carbohydrate is a conductor for
[1622.08 - 1627.68] mineral salts conductor for mineral
[1624.80 - 1630.28] salts mineral salts sodium chloride you
[1627.68 - 1634.56] know potassium magnesium all these
[1630.28 - 1636.36] different mineral salts and um and and
[1634.56 - 1638.24] those sugars in the brain the glycogen
[1636.36 - 1640.92] that's a conductor so that these mineral
[1638.24 - 1643.84] salts become a neuron a neurotransmitter
[1640.92 - 1645.36] sorry so they become a
[1643.84 - 1647.96] neurotransmitter and that
[1645.36 - 1650.96] neurotransmitter is a chemical that sits
[1647.96 - 1653.64] on a neuron so we can think and function
[1650.96 - 1656.20] and get stressed out and work hard and
[1653.64 - 1659.64] play hard and do whatever we got to
[1656.20 - 1661.20] do and so that's just so you know the
[1659.64 - 1664.60] background a little bit when you have
[1661.20 - 1666.56] heavy metals in the brain they interfere
[1664.60 - 1667.96] with electrical impulses running down in
[1666.56 - 1669.56] neurons so you got you have to
[1667.96 - 1671.08] understand you have this neuron and you
[1669.56 - 1672.96] got electrical impulse that needs to get
[1671.08 - 1675.04] to one end to the neuron to the other so
[1672.96 - 1677.84] we can communicate so we can talk so we
[1675.04 - 1680.56] can function and as that electrical
[1677.84 - 1682.48] impulse is driving down that neuron it
[1680.56 - 1684.84] needs that neurochemical that
[1682.48 - 1688.96] neurotransmitter chemical potassium
[1684.84 - 1692.24] sodium chloride magnesium it needs those
[1688.96 - 1694.92] to run and be and just to run that
[1692.24 - 1696.64] electrical impulse across the neuron and
[1694.92 - 1698.88] then if you're loaded with heavy metals
[1696.64 - 1701.56] Mercury cadmiun lead if you you know
[1698.88 - 1703.68] where Mercury for sure aluminum they
[1701.56 - 1706.52] deflect they get in the way they they
[1703.68 - 1708.52] they D down the flame of of the uh the
[1706.52 - 1710.16] neurotransmitter they die down the flame
[1708.52 - 1713.64] of the electrical impulse running you
[1710.16 - 1716.76] know running running down the neuron
[1713.64 - 1719.36] using the neurotransmitter to do so and
[1716.76 - 1721.12] it just it dieses out the flame so we
[1719.36 - 1723.80] got to get the heavy metals out of there
[1721.12 - 1725.76] and heavy metals oxidize into the brain
[1723.80 - 1727.72] and they end up bleeding into the brain
[1725.76 - 1731.20] meaning that they oxidize and run off
[1727.72 - 1733.88] like a river polluting the
[1731.20 - 1735.48] brain and so we have to clean out the
[1733.88 - 1738.16] metals out of the brain that's number
[1735.48 - 1741.80] one got to clean out the old the old
[1738.16 - 1745.24] glutamate not glutamine glutamate the
[1741.80 - 1747.00] MSG um lots of MSG in the brain we have
[1745.24 - 1748.64] in many different people pockets of it
[1747.00 - 1751.64] in different places we need to clear
[1748.64 - 1753.12] that out as well aspiran got to get the
[1751.64 - 1756.44] aspiran out of the
[1753.12 - 1758.20] brain and that's important and all this
[1756.44 - 1759.64] is critical and then we got to make sure
[1758.20 - 1761.68] our brain is healthy with enough
[1759.64 - 1763.44] glycogen so we need the right foods and
[1761.68 - 1766.32] I'm going to talk about that and we need
[1763.44 - 1767.84] to get rid of the wrong foods to get our
[1766.32 - 1770.92] brains healthy
[1767.84 - 1772.28] healthier see all this is important and
[1770.92 - 1774.80] we're going to cover some supplements
[1772.28 - 1779.00] too about how you know what's good for
[1774.80 - 1782.12] the brain so the goal is that under
[1779.00 - 1783.28] stress we need a carbohydrate if we're
[1782.12 - 1786.64] under
[1783.28 - 1790.44] stress the carbohydrate and eating when
[1786.64 - 1793.80] we're under stress stops our adrenaline
[1790.44 - 1796.84] from dissolving our
[1793.80 - 1797.88] brains what happens is adrenaline
[1796.84 - 1802.04] becomes
[1797.88 - 1803.72] one of the most toxic substances to us
[1802.04 - 1805.20] that destroys our brain health so this
[1803.72 - 1806.80] shows about brain health and I'm going
[1805.20 - 1809.44] to tell you one of the one of the most
[1806.80 - 1813.04] toxic substances is our own adrenaline
[1809.44 - 1817.08] being triggered off by crap happening in
[1813.04 - 1820.84] our lives you know like bad news and you
[1817.08 - 1823.12] know you name it and the shock of bad
[1820.84 - 1826.12] news why do you think we say Hey you
[1823.12 - 1828.56] have to sit down for this list listen
[1826.12 - 1831.36] listen Mack I think you're gonna have to
[1828.56 - 1833.76] sit down because I got to tell you
[1831.36 - 1835.40] something I gotta break break some news
[1833.76 - 1836.76] to you because if you're standing up
[1835.40 - 1839.80] you're going to have an electrical shock
[1836.76 - 1842.40] so hard in the brain that you might pass
[1839.80 - 1844.48] out or you might just fall backwards so
[1842.40 - 1846.80] we might have to just have you sit
[1844.48 - 1848.76] down I always find it doesn't work to
[1846.80 - 1850.68] get bad news delivered to you sitting
[1848.76 - 1853.40] down I I I would rather
[1850.68 - 1857.64] Pace with bad news coming to me I'd
[1853.40 - 1859.28] rather be moving a little bit um but
[1857.64 - 1861.72] there's a reason why we tell people to
[1859.28 - 1864.08] sit down there's an electrical shock
[1861.72 - 1865.64] it's magnified when it gets handed to us
[1864.08 - 1867.64] like this when we get stressed or bad
[1865.64 - 1870.80] news or we're under the gun and then our
[1867.64 - 1873.60] adrenaline floods if you're not eating
[1870.80 - 1875.56] enough carbohydrate during that day or
[1873.60 - 1877.88] every hour and a half or two hours your
[1875.56 - 1880.56] adrenaline will just go into the brain
[1877.88 - 1882.80] and start saturating it and pickling it
[1880.56 - 1885.16] pickling it like it was in
[1882.80 - 1888.00] vinegar and and this is what we're up
[1885.16 - 1890.52] against it's
[1888.00 - 1892.32] basically a technique it's a way we you
[1890.52 - 1893.76] know we we survive it's fight or flight
[1892.32 - 1896.36] but when we're under fight or flight so
[1893.76 - 1899.84] much we have to be cautious and Cal it
[1896.36 - 1901.56] down and make sure we have enough of
[1899.84 - 1904.36] those good carbohydrates to stop us from
[1901.56 - 1907.88] fight or flight meaning it stops the
[1904.36 - 1908.92] Damage Done by the adrenaline it Shields
[1907.88 - 1912.12] the
[1908.92 - 1914.32] adrenaline and it's also why naturally
[1912.12 - 1915.60] you know you go look you know you take
[1914.32 - 1918.32] your child to the doctor's office and
[1915.60 - 1920.60] they got lollipop sitting there after
[1918.32 - 1922.44] after your child had you know um you
[1920.60 - 1924.92] know a look after the doctor looked down
[1922.44 - 1926.80] your child's throat and told your your
[1924.92 - 1929.60] child to say ah it was kind of a scary
[1926.80 - 1931.44] experience so then you know your child
[1929.60 - 1934.88] you know it's you need a lollipop at the
[1931.44 - 1936.60] end or or Mom will take the child to to
[1934.88 - 1939.40] get some ice cream afterwards after a
[1936.60 - 1941.36] doctor's visit that happens a lot
[1939.40 - 1944.48] because those are not good forms of
[1941.36 - 1946.84] sugar but it's to kind of take that
[1944.48 - 1948.80] shock of whatever adrenaline was kind of
[1946.84 - 1951.52] running from being
[1948.80 - 1954.16] scared and so
[1951.52 - 1956.08] glucose is what we need to protect
[1954.16 - 1957.32] ourselves in a stressful world that we
[1956.08 - 1959.76] live in today but it's not just
[1957.32 - 1962.76] protecting ourselves it's protecting our
[1959.76 - 1964.56] brains and the 21st century we're
[1962.76 - 1966.76] getting some serious brain rot it is
[1964.56 - 1969.32] evident it is rampant it is out of
[1966.76 - 1971.36] control protein does not keep our brain
[1969.32 - 1975.08] healthy and protein does
[1971.36 - 1978.24] not make our brain stay
[1975.08 - 1979.76] strong um that that's very important to
[1978.24 - 1981.48] understand just so you know I'm not
[1979.76 - 1983.44] anti-protein we need our protein from
[1981.48 - 1985.56] lots of fruits and vegetables you know
[1983.44 - 1987.40] there's other protein sources people get
[1985.56 - 1991.08] it from you know high quality animal
[1987.40 - 1993.56] products but the goal is the goal is is
[1991.08 - 1995.28] that we can't do the carb free thing we
[1993.56 - 1998.32] can't go that route we have to have a
[1995.28 - 2001.12] lot of fresh fruits in our diet and I
[1998.32 - 2004.68] want to go into that now
[2001.12 - 2007.28] antioxidants stops your brain from dying
[2004.68 - 2009.80] it's antioxidants so phytochemicals it's
[2007.28 - 2011.24] the phytochemical antioxidant family and
[2009.80 - 2012.68] especially the one that's not even
[2011.24 - 2016.84] discovered by science that I talk about
[2012.68 - 2019.36] in life-changing Foods they keep your
[2016.84 - 2022.68] brain from dying that's what
[2019.36 - 2025.04] antioxidants do they stop the dying
[2022.68 - 2028.96] process highest forms of antioxidants
[2025.04 - 2032.16] are in the fruit group so don't be
[2028.96 - 2034.56] afraid of eating an apple an apple is
[2032.16 - 2037.24] anti-inflammatory for the
[2034.56 - 2039.20] brain TI in antioxidants but it's ant
[2037.24 - 2041.68] anti-inflammatory and it's not a white
[2039.20 - 2043.48] food just because the skin is remember
[2041.68 - 2046.08] the skin is red you open an apple it's
[2043.48 - 2049.36] white inside that's where the people who
[2046.08 - 2051.32] pick on potatoes got it all wrong okay
[2049.36 - 2053.80] then maybe call an apple a white food
[2051.32 - 2056.08] then you you see what I'm saying you
[2053.80 - 2059.36] guys another piece of you know you can
[2056.08 - 2061.32] you can really do your own you know your
[2059.36 - 2063.28] breakdown on some of these Trends and
[2061.32 - 2065.04] some of these fads you could even just
[2063.28 - 2068.00] you know learn how to break them apart
[2065.04 - 2070.60] yourself because they're that
[2068.00 - 2072.88] ridiculous so anyway an Apple's not a
[2070.60 - 2074.48] white food yes it's powerful and that's
[2072.88 - 2075.72] what we need to be helping that's a
[2074.48 - 2079.44] brain
[2075.72 - 2081.12] food so the goal is lots of antioxidants
[2079.44 - 2083.12] for the brain you do the heavy metal
[2081.12 - 2087.04] detox for the brain the
[2083.12 - 2089.72] spirulina the cilantro the barley grass
[2087.04 - 2092.20] juice powder and you guys know my
[2089.72 - 2094.04] favorite I have it listed on my um you
[2092.20 - 2096.08] know it's on my website if you want to
[2094.04 - 2097.64] look I mean there's one there and
[2096.08 - 2100.52] that'll take you to a place to get it
[2097.64 - 2103.96] and so the barley grass juice powder and
[2100.52 - 2107.32] the dols the cilantro it's that whole
[2103.96 - 2109.48] team to get the metals out of the brain
[2107.32 - 2111.48] and and that team also does have
[2109.48 - 2113.16] phytochemicals in it that that that help
[2111.48 - 2115.08] with mineral salts help with
[2113.16 - 2117.48] neurotransmitters but that's the team
[2115.08 - 2118.80] there and then you want lots of fresh
[2117.48 - 2120.48] fruit in your diet I'm not talking about
[2118.80 - 2122.48] you don't have to eat just just fruit if
[2120.48 - 2124.20] you don't want to that's fine you just
[2122.48 - 2125.60] have to have it in there you can't H not
[2124.20 - 2127.96] have your berries got to have your
[2125.60 - 2130.64] blackberries your raspberries when's the
[2127.96 - 2132.76] last time you had blackberries I want to
[2130.64 - 2133.76] know I want to know the last time you
[2132.76 - 2136.72] had
[2133.76 - 2140.12] blackberries and so you know we need
[2136.72 - 2144.80] these you got your apples oranges
[2140.12 - 2146.80] calcium from oranges supports the brain
[2144.80 - 2148.80] supports the nervous system supports the
[2146.80 - 2151.32] brain so
[2148.80 - 2153.00] calcium that's that's a that's another
[2151.32 - 2154.56] one that's actually a neurotransmitter
[2153.00 - 2156.48] chemical believe it or not it's not
[2154.56 - 2160.12] listed as one but it is it's in the
[2156.48 - 2162.08] family meaning it helps support that so
[2160.12 - 2164.40] get that from oranges best source of
[2162.08 - 2167.00] calorie you know best source of of you
[2164.40 - 2170.08] know calcium and it's also a great
[2167.00 - 2171.24] caloric food for the brain um so these
[2170.08 - 2173.12] are some of the things we're talking
[2171.24 - 2175.20] about what we can do to protect our
[2173.12 - 2177.36] brain in every way
[2175.20 - 2179.04] possible let's go into some different
[2177.36 - 2181.28] stuff we'll go into some foods wild
[2179.04 - 2183.28] blueberries most powerful antioxidant
[2181.28 - 2185.28] there is for the brain for keeping your
[2183.28 - 2188.48] brain healthy so it doesn't shrink and
[2185.28 - 2191.80] it doesn't swell
[2188.48 - 2193.32] and celery juice the mineral salts and
[2191.80 - 2194.84] celery juice you guys doing the celery

[2277.36 - 2280.80] and you think you got a problem and you
[2279.28 - 2283.00] think you got something and you think
[2280.80 - 2285.08] you got your handle on it and you you
[2283.00 - 2287.00] know what food to use you got to use a
[2285.08 - 2290.28] decent amount of the food you can't just
[2287.00 - 2292.68] have a cucumber once a week if if you
[2290.28 - 2294.72] think you got something you know
[2292.68 - 2296.16] happening and you want to eat some wild
[2294.72 - 2298.92] blueberries you can't just eat them once
[2296.16 - 2301.16] a month although it will still help you
[2298.92 - 2302.80] and will still protect you but for
[2301.16 - 2304.48] getting better you want those wild
[2302.80 - 2305.96] blueberries every day you want a celery

[2318.08 - 2323.44] going on leafy
[2320.44 - 2325.56] greens leafy greens
[2323.44 - 2329.16] incredible for the
[2325.56 - 2331.08] brain spinach lettuces butterleaf
[2329.16 - 2335.84] lettuce has a
[2331.08 - 2337.40] rare aega oil in it that goes to the
[2335.84 - 2339.48] brain remember I told you there's still
[2337.40 - 2341.92] a percentage I'm not saying that the
[2339.48 - 2344.64] Omega-3s and I'm not saying the DHA
[2341.92 - 2346.64] Omega-3s and and and fats aren't in the
[2344.64 - 2349.76] brain I just told you it's a smaller
[2346.64 - 2351.96] percentage it's much smaller it's not as
[2349.76 - 2356.40] important as the carbo carbohydrate
[2351.96 - 2358.88] factor that it's not as important okay
[2356.40 - 2361.60] that means that we do need that Omega-3
[2358.88 - 2364.28] for the brain but it's not a deal
[2361.60 - 2365.96] breaker people can live long enough
[2364.28 - 2367.84] without it you take away the
[2365.96 - 2370.84] carbohydrates out of the brain people
[2367.84 - 2372.24] die pretty fast it's a deal breaker you
[2370.84 - 2375.92] see the difference that's what I'm
[2372.24 - 2377.20] trying to say all right um so and you
[2375.92 - 2379.28] can search for all the brain books you
[2377.20 - 2381.84] want out there and you're just like
[2379.28 - 2383.40] antiquate it antiquate it antiquate it

[2411.36 - 2414.96] just got to get the right information
[2412.84 - 2419.24] now because it's that important it it
[2414.96 - 2421.24] matters it so matters Arta chokes Arta
[2419.24 - 2422.88] chokes incredible for the liver which
[2421.24 - 2425.28] helps the brain cuz the liver gets
[2422.88 - 2427.32] clogged up with Epstein bar toxins gets
[2425.28 - 2430.00] clogged up with heavy metal it gets
[2427.32 - 2433.16] clogged up and when the liver gets
[2430.00 - 2435.32] clogged up and we're in trouble because
[2433.16 - 2437.76] it's just just it just releases it all
[2435.32 - 2440.16] in the bloodstream everywhere it
[2437.76 - 2442.80] releases it all in the bloodstream and
[2440.16 - 2446.20] when it does it gets to the brain and it
[2442.80 - 2448.48] cause causes brain fog memory loss all
[2446.20 - 2450.36] those neurotoxins from Epstein bar and
[2448.48 - 2454.24] different viruses and different bugs it
[2450.36 - 2456.72] all gets into the brain causes brain fog
[2454.24 - 2458.24] confusion so you want to get your arch
[2456.72 - 2461.92] chokes it helps with that helps with the
[2458.24 - 2465.32] liver parsley another great one parsley
[2461.92 - 2467.64] helps remove toxins like MSG and other
[2465.32 - 2469.60] types of toxins and pesticides and and
[2467.64 - 2472.52] you know the whole bit it helps remove
[2469.60 - 2475.92] that so we like partially for the brain
[2472.52 - 2479.04] it's what it is is it hitches a ride to
[2475.92 - 2481.08] the the Fab Five you know it hitches a
[2479.04 - 2483.80] ride to the sparina cilantro to the
[2481.08 - 2485.64] barley grass to the DOL to um you know
[2483.80 - 2488.92] the wild blueberries partially kind of
[2485.64 - 2491.20] you know what it helps it helps walnuts
[2488.92 - 2493.04] now try not to get thrown by that whole
[2491.20 - 2495.12] thing where the Walnut shaped like a
[2493.04 - 2497.12] brain so then it's good for your brain
[2495.12 - 2498.40] try not to kind of get thrown by that
[2497.12 - 2499.56] because there's better things for your
[2498.40 - 2501.68] brain and they're not shaped like a
[2499.56 - 2503.00] brain the wild blueberry is the most
[2501.68 - 2504.68] powerful food on the planet for the
[2503.00 - 2506.04] brain is it shaped like a brain no it's
[2504.68 - 2509.44] not shaped like a brain it's shaped like
[2506.04 - 2511.60] a wild blueberry all right so I I I
[2509.44 - 2512.84] realize that there's information out
[2511.60 - 2514.76] there that we kind of get we could get
[2512.84 - 2516.80] sucked into like oh yeah wait a minute
[2514.76 - 2519.08] the walnuts looks like a braak brain
[2516.80 - 2521.40] okay that's a brain the Tomato looks
[2519.08 - 2523.64] like a heart that's a heart doesn't work
[2521.40 - 2526.00] like that the most powerful brain food
[2523.64 - 2528.88] there is in existence right now is the
[2526.00 - 2532.20] wild blueberry hands down can't touch it
[2528.88 - 2534.24] it's not shaped like a brain okay just
[2532.20 - 2536.28] you know I know I'm being sarcastic but
[2534.24 - 2539.44] it's because you got to make sure you
[2536.28 - 2541.32] know what's best it's so important right
[2539.44 - 2543.76] now in our life in our world today I
[2541.32 - 2545.68] can't express it enough and I like to
[2543.76 - 2547.28] joke around a little bit too I know I
[2545.68 - 2549.44] know so
[2547.28 - 2551.44] but the wild blueberry seriously but
[2549.44 - 2553.32] walnuts are good for the brain they
[2551.44 - 2555.80] really are they are because they do have
[2553.32 - 2557.32] that omega-3 that is that one little
[2555.80 - 2559.48] part that one little portion that does
[2557.32 - 2561.52] help the brain and help protect us like
[2559.48 - 2564.20] I said though it's not a deal breaker
[2561.52 - 2567.12] but I want some walnuts in your diet hem
[2564.20 - 2568.40] seeds same reason is a hem seed first of
[2567.12 - 2570.32] all hem seeds are better for your brain
[2568.40 - 2572.28] than Walnut are hem seeds shaped like a
[2570.32 - 2574.60] brain I want to know all right so you
[2572.28 - 2576.80] know hemp seeds are really good so
[2574.60 - 2578.36] that's a great one tum turmeric that's
[2576.80 - 2580.28] good for the brain helps the body
[2578.36 - 2582.08] cleanse helps the body detox supports
[2580.28 - 2584.36] the liver supports the pancreas a little
[2582.08 - 2586.20] bit of turmeric is wonderful
[2584.36 - 2590.96] coconut
[2586.20 - 2593.80] coconut coconut water coconut water
[2590.96 - 2596.32] coconut that's great you know coconut
[2593.80 - 2599.08] meat young coconut meat you know you
[2596.32 - 2601.32] know coconut butter okay it it it's
[2599.08 - 2604.84] actually good for the brain one reason
[2601.32 - 2608.60] why it's good for the brain is because
[2604.84 - 2613.56] it's it actually knocks down viral loads
[2608.60 - 2615.52] so it knocks down um Epstein bar in the
[2613.56 - 2617.04] liver knocks it down a little bit so
[2615.52 - 2619.28] coconut should be in the diet one way or
[2617.04 - 2621.24] another it knocks down that and that's
[2619.28 - 2623.32] why people start feeling a little bit
[2621.24 - 2625.76] better with brain problems it's not the
[2623.32 - 2628.24] coconut going to the brain it's the
[2625.76 - 2630.32] coconut knocking down the viral load
[2628.24 - 2631.88] that's clogging up their bloodstream and
[2630.32 - 2633.80] getting to the blood brain barrier and
[2631.88 - 2636.08] poisoning the person's brain giving them
[2633.80 - 2638.64] brain fog and brain confusion so coconut
[2636.08 - 2642.12] that's really good aloe
[2638.64 - 2644.36] vera fantastic it's just a great food
[2642.12 - 2646.20] all all around for the brain cleans up
[2644.36 - 2648.44] the liver cleans up the digestive tract
[2646.20 - 2650.40] gets a lot of heavy metals out of there
[2648.44 - 2653.52] um gets viral debris out of there aloe
[2650.40 - 2656.72] vera is fantastic sea vegetables amazing
[2653.52 - 2659.00] sea vegetables helps remove everything
[2656.72 - 2661.68] under the Sun out of her bodies
[2659.00 - 2665.44] pesticides radiation DDT heavy metals
[2661.68 - 2666.88] you name it sea vegetables dolls kelp
[2665.44 - 2668.36] very important
[2666.88 - 2670.36] okay so make sure they're in the diet
[2668.36 - 2673.60] make sure you're using them they support
[2670.36 - 2676.80] the brain they protect us and and uh
[2673.60 - 2680.12] keep them in there bananas yeah bananas
[2676.80 - 2682.44] don't throw away your bananas I heard
[2680.12 - 2686.16] years ago and I couldn't believe this
[2682.44 - 2688.72] when the banana was becoming a a hated
[2686.16 - 2691.92] uh you item in the world I heard there
[2688.72 - 2694.52] was some huge conference somewhere and
[2691.92 - 2698.00] some of the practitioners on the stage
[2694.52 - 2700.72] had a they they open up the entire
[2698.00 - 2703.00] conference holding a banana and throwing
[2700.72 - 2705.20] it against the wall as the
[2703.00 - 2706.36] opening because it was because it had
[2705.20 - 2709.36] sugar in
[2706.36 - 2713.36] it yeah let me tell you something about
[2709.36 - 2716.08] banana it's the only thing on the planet
[2713.36 - 2720.00] the only thing we have today that kills
[2716.08 - 2722.52] HIV AIDS the virus itself the retrovirus
[2720.00 - 2726.48] when put together in a Petri dish with
[2722.52 - 2729.24] it nothing else has killed HIV
[2726.48 - 2730.96] retrovirus I mean killed killed it just
[2729.24 - 2733.48] Banana by itself it's one of the most
[2730.96 - 2735.96] powerful antiviral Foods we have it's
[2733.48 - 2738.04] got also it has neurotransmitter
[2735.96 - 2740.52] chemicals to get us to sleep to Pro
[2738.04 - 2742.80] protect us our brains it massages the
[2740.52 - 2744.96] intestinal tract kills CBO kills strep
[2742.80 - 2747.16] in the intestinal tract kills everything
[2744.96 - 2750.76] out of the intestinal tract knocks out
[2747.16 - 2753.68] fungus just clears out mold and that's
[2750.76 - 2755.68] what banana does but it was thrown
[2753.68 - 2757.72] against the wall at a contract at a at a
[2755.68 - 2758.60] at a a conference it was thrown against
[2757.72 - 2761.20] the
[2758.60 - 2763.48] wall and you know so I'm just giving you
[2761.20 - 2765.24] the rundown and that's how banana the
[2763.48 - 2767.12] whole banana move it anti- banana
[2765.24 - 2768.80] movement started I don't know if it was
[2767.12 - 2770.60] seven years ago six years ago five years
[2768.80 - 2773.00] ago but it it started and just has been
[2770.60 - 2776.24] blossoming from there make sure you get
[2773.00 - 2778.48] some bananas in there okay we'll talk
[2776.24 - 2780.20] about you know we talked about let's do
[2778.48 - 2782.16] a recap really quick we talked about the
[2780.20 - 2784.04] brain eaing sugar it runs on sugar cools
[2782.16 - 2785.92] down the engine and it's also made out
[2784.04 - 2787.68] of carbohydrates the brain I was like I
[2785.92 - 2789.72] was telling you before not bad sugar
[2787.68 - 2792.32] good sugar like some fruits and some
[2789.72 - 2795.32] sweet potatoes some butternut squash and
[2792.32 - 2797.80] fats are okay too avocado hem seeds
[2795.32 - 2799.76] walnuts coconut you know and other fats
[2797.80 - 2801.52] too if you if you're eating really good
[2799.76 - 2803.20] healthy lean meats and you like that
[2801.52 - 2805.44] it's going to be better off than than
[2803.20 - 2808.36] bad Meats stay away from pork because
[2805.44 - 2810.16] pork fat doesn't help the brain um if
[2808.36 - 2812.28] you're into you know if you're into uh
[2810.16 - 2814.20] fish make sure it's salmon or hbit or
[2812.28 - 2816.12] hack those are actually decent if you're
[2814.20 - 2818.40] into fish um if you're you're into
[2816.12 - 2819.96] proteins animal proteins just minimize
[2818.40 - 2822.48] them a little bit each day if you have a
[2819.96 - 2824.00] brain issue if you have a brain issue or
[2822.48 - 2825.20] a brain problem just lower the animal
[2824.00 - 2827.40] proteins I'm not telling you you have to
[2825.20 - 2829.16] quit and you know and some people they
[2827.40 - 2830.64] can if they want some people they don't
[2829.16 - 2832.56] have to they could just lower them but
[2830.64 - 2834.44] just lower them make it moderate so you
[2832.56 - 2836.36] can get room for the things that help
[2834.44 - 2839.36] your brain the room for the things that
