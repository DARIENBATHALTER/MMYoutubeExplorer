00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
I'm at Cafe Gratitude in Venice right

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,879
now. This is a delicious tahini butter

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,040
cookie called I am comforting

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,120
collaboration between Cafe Gratitude and

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,960
Medical Medium. One thing really

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,279
important to know, no oils. Most cookies

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,640
have oil in them. They either have

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,080
butter or oil. These cookies do not have

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,320
oil. That alone is amazing. Doesn't have

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,279
any crazy sweeteners added to it either.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,800
It's got pure maple syrup. These are

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,960
comfort food cookies. The name is I am

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,960
comforting and it's not like peanut

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,360
butter. It's better than that.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
Especially if you have it with a cup of

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,000
this healing time tea. Now, this is a

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,399
medical medium healing tool where it's

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
straight sprigs of thyme put right into

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
a cup of tea. Thyme tea has all kinds of

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,840
benefits. It helps with all kinds of

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,320
different health issues. It's

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,800
antimicrobial, antiviral, antibacterial.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,800
Having that with this cookies. Amazing.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Truly.

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,720
Cookies and tea. Are you excited? Yes.

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,200
Yes. Yes. The cookies were good. The

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,040
tahini cookie was amazing. I think the

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
cookies stood out most for me because I

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
never get to eat cookies. So, I really

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,119
enjoyed those a lot. The cookies was

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,360
very yummy. Yes. I have to say I love

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,159
the tea. Also, I dreamed about the

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,960
cookies to put the cookies in the thyme

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,600
tea to put a little bit in and then a to

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,420
get like this flavor in your mouth. It

36
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,560
is delicious.

38
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
The menu items, come on. Like pizza,

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
it's the noodle salads, it's the

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,439
cookies, it's the tea. Like, I'm

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
incredibly grateful for Cafe Gratitude,

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,439
the creativity that they put into it.

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
It's so refreshing to go to a restaurant

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
and not have to worry about like waking

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,680
up feeling like you don't have any

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
energy the next day or your healing's

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,280
been compromised knowing there's no seed

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,880
oils and all that. So yeah, we're ready

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,680
to feast. I'm ready for a four course

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,680
meal. I cannot wait.

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,319
Everybody loves a good cookie. This is

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
an epic cookie here. A collaboration

53
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,440
between Cafe Gratitude, Chef Drew,

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
Medical Medium. I hope you come down and

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,200
experience this here at Catholic

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
