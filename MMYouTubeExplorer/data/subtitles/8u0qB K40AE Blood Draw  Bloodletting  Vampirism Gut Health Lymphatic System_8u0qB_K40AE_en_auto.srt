223
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,599
nutritionist i'm telling you that your

i'm a health coach and i'm telling you

226
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,080
that your immune system is all in your

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
gut because we just parrot everything we

228
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
hear and see

229
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,479

230
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,160
immune systems all in your gut

231
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
well all that comes from gut health

232
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
companies that sell crap and

233
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
gut health uh probiotic companies that

234
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
sell stuff and it's pseudoscience it's

235
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
pseudoscience

236
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
real science doesn't even believe in

237
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
that science that's pseudoscience it's

238
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
gut health

239
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
companies create this pseudoscience so

240
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,759
they can somehow have

241
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
something behind their gut product that

242
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,479
spreads and gets out there

243
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,160
and then you're going to be like well

244
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,120
the immune system's in the gut it's not

245
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
in the gut

246
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240

medical medium the link is in

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,039
that guy he's the medical medium

263
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,280

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,080
listen to this episode you don't like

265
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
them fine but

266
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
listen to this episode because it can

267
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,399
protect you your family save your life

268
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,120
you don't have to like me um to save

269
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,839
your life

270
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
kathy do you gain immune cells with

271
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,080
transfusion

272
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
great question the immune cells they try

273
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
to work

274
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,160
they try to work when you get an

275
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
infusion okay so

276
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
so when someone else's immune cells are

277
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,839
in the blood and you get the blood but

278
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
it doesn't normally line up that way so

279
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,320
it doesn't work that way

280
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,399
sometimes sometimes they're well first

281
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
of all they diminish over time and then

282
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,440
your your immune cells take over so your

283
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
immune cells take over your bone marrow

284
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
produces more immune cells

285
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,440
and then but but your immune cells can

286
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,640
live in that blood they can live

287
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
in the blood of another person right so

288
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
so then when you get your blood

289
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,320
transfusion your immune cells that

290
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,160
that develop fill that new fresh blood

291
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,120
okay and then the old immune cells

292
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,839
that were that were basically um

293
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,680
stationed for that other human being

294
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
they don't work the same way in your

295
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,880
body as they would work in someone

296
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,839
else's body even if the blood type is

297
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,959
the same

298
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
but still doesn't matter blood

299
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,640
transfusions are are important or

300
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
critical and they still give you all

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
these other things that give you glucose

302
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
they give you

303
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
they give you iron they give you all

304
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,720
these other things

305
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,800
leanne i had a huge blood draw in

306
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,920
december and then crashed

307
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,080
in a big way in february two rounds of

308
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,600
the advance 369 saved me thank you

309
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,760
anthony see

310
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
look how important the blood draw

311
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,399
information is

312
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,040
and if i wasn't censored and suppressed

313
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,360
okay where you know the platforms they

314
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,200
kick everybody off my platforms and it's

315
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
lucky i even have anybody on here now

316
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,279
any of you guys you're not just booted

317
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,760
off

318
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,880
like on ig everybody's just booted off

319
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,200
and

320
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
if it wasn't for the censorship you know

321
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
this stuff would get

322
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
out even faster to save more lives but

323
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,959
it's it's hard to get it

324
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,839
out into the world um so but the good

325
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,680
news is i

326
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
put some of that blood draw information

327
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,079
in the medical medium

328
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,120
new edition and that is going to be out

329
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
there millions of people are going to

330
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,640
have this in their hands so that's the

331
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,680
good news at least there's a way

332
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
freedom of the press there's a way to

333
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
get

334
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,959
you know that this freedom of speech in

335
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
the book to get it out

they're not burning books yet they're

338
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720

339
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,240
suppressing everybody in different ways

340
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440

which is important

361
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,160
christie moore michota's healing yes i

362
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,320
know i was

363
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
wondering though after the podcast we

364
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,279
lost our immune system when blood gets

365
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
taken

366
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,880
so in order sorry in other words we lose

367
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
our immune system

368
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
during our periods too right it's much

369
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
different

370
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
much different because you're not

371
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,480
bleeding as much blood in your period

372
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,920
and that's a natural process in life

373
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,600
having a needle go into your vein okay

374
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,519
and drawing out a large amount of blood

375
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,279
is not a natural process at all

376
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
so that's the difference okay because

377
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
your immune system floating around your

378
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,800
bloodstream

379
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
is doing its job right and your immune

380
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,519
system

381
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
that's in your reproductive system is

382
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
doing its job

383
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,000
but there's that's the natural process

384
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,399
you lose

385
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
some blood but you're losing more than

386
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,240
blood through your menstruation cycle

387
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,320
you're losing the lining of the uterus

388
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
the shedding of the lining of the uterus

389
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,279
you're losing that

390
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,720
okay there's also mucus that comes out

391
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,160
with the blood

392
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,720
and the fluid with the blood too

393
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
so it's not as much blood it's it's not

394
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
even a fraction of blood

395
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
and that's the difference okay and that

396
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
right there

397
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,920
also weakens the immune system of women

398
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,440
that's the other point too

399
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,519
so so menstruation is when

400
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,639
your immune system does drop so that's

401
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
what happens with women

402
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,079
their immune systems drop during

403
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,000
menstruation and then as it drops during

404
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,000
menstruation they get their acne back

405
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,120
they get their migraines back they get

406
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,120
symptoms

407
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
all this other thing that happens okay

408
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,399
and so um

409
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,240
80 of the immune system runs to the

410
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,720
reproductive system to protect the

411
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
reproductive system when you bleed

412
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
a little bit with your uh with your

413
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
cycle but you've got to listen to the

414
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
podcast i talk all about it

415
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
um but when you lose too much blood

416
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
during a cycle then it's a concern

417
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
why is it a concern why are the doctors

418
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,680
worried how come

419
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,880
when you're losing a lot of blood during

420
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,639
a menstruation cycle

421
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
right where it's abnormal and you're

422
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,480
like oh my god i'm just i'm i feel like

423
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,360
i'm hemorrhaging or something i'm losing

424
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
so much blood

425
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,200
and now the doctors are really worried

426
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
well guess what

427
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,240
they're not worried when they take 70

428
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,639
milliliters

429
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
80 milliliters 140 milliliters 240

430
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,560
milliliters

431
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
300 milliliters that's 30 tubes 30 vials

432
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
of blood

433
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,639
300 milliliters they're not worried at

434
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,160
all taking out of you at all

435
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
you go donate blood they're going to

436
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,880
take 500 milliliters out they're not

437
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,160
worried at all

438
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,920
120 pound female chronically ill goes to

439
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
donate blood who doesn't feel that great

440
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,639
overall

441
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,399
she donates blood she loses a pint of

442
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
blood they're not worried there

443
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
no one's worried but the minute your

444
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,839
cycle you're starting to lose a little

445
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
too much what they're like

446
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,680
scared crap the doctor's like oh my god

447
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,279
we have to you're losing some blood

448
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,800
but they don't care when they draw it

449
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
all out if you see the difference these

450
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
are just

451
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,880
these are just some of the difference dr

452
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,680
faun md he's not saying to not

453
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,639
do blood tests he says let them take

454
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
less

455
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,399
exactly and if you hear the podcast

456
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
you'll know why and how

457
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,560
it's important to know i'm not saying

458
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
don't get a blood test but the system's

459
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,839
broken

460
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,079
and i'll give you a little demonstration

461
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,440
with the white blood cell

462
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:45,440
when we tap into those veins okay

463
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,560
we tap into those veins we're taking

464
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,320
your white count your red count we're

465
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,959
taking your cbc

466
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:58,000
cbc see you later bye cbc

467
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
bye gone we take your cbc and that's

468
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
what happens here

469
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,440
okay if you're wondering why i have all

470
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,440
the goodies here i got a chocolate chip

471
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
cookie here i got a half a hard-boiled

472
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,040
egg

473
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
i got a chicken piece of chicken and i

474
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
got an

475
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
ice cream on a stick we're going to talk

476
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,680
about that in a second

477
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,360
um so you lose your immune system when

478
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,600
you get those big blood draws

479
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,720
and the blood lab doesn't even use a

480
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,199
fraction of that

481
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,760
just not even a frat i mean such a small

482
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,079
amount

483
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,279
you throw it all away or it goes off

484
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,440
somewhere else on the black market

485
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,199
so and our immune system doesn't build

486
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,399
fast it doesn't build fast it doesn't

487
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,320
build back in one day

488
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,079
doesn't build back in three days when

489
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,560
you get a blood draw even five

490
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,000
vials a blood draw you're waiting weeks

491
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,320
to get your immune system back

492
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
so then if you've got some kind of viral

493
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
issue or some kind of

494
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,600
streptococcus bacteria if you've got a

495
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,440
little bit of that

496
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,160
some for some reason right a little bit

497
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,639
of strep bacteria in your system to say

498
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
is why i have the dummy with me say you

499
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,120
got chronic sinusitis

500
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,199
so chronic sinusitis well that's

501
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,519
streptococcus bacteria

502
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,519
lodged in your sinus cavities causes

503
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
scar tissue get people get surgeries

504
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
because of it they don't know it's

505
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
strapped but that's what it is

506
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,720
so you got your streptococcus bacteria

507
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,560
lodged in the sinus cavities well what

508
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
happens is your immune system

509
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
okay your immune system's keeping

510
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,120
everything at bay

511
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,959
keeping everything good right and you

512
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
start removing your immune system

513
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,839
now you're set up for a new

514
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,839
streptococcus infection and now you've

515
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,519
got a bad sinus infection three weeks

516
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,199
later but don't know why

517
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,880
that's just one example immune system

518
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
doesn't rebuild in just a week

519
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
it could take four to six weeks it could

520
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,759
take three to six months depending on

521
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,680
variables who you are

522
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
what kind of condition you're in if you

523
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,519
already have a weakened immune system

524
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
and if you've got some fibro and some ms

525
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,519
and you've got

526
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,199
eczema psoriasis and you got ra and i

527
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
talk all about this in the podcast and

528
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,600
guess what

529
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,279
you're already dealing with a weakened

530
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
immune system that you have to fix and

531
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
heal and do all the right stuff and

532
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
learn

533
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
talk about the new edition check it out

534
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
okay

535
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,880
and sonja i recently had a bone marrow

536
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,839
transplant

537
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,319
and have statistics that show my blood

538
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:20,720
building through my weekly draws this

539
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,559
includes wbcs neutrophils platelets bone

540
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
marrow will replace

541
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,559
lost blood because it desires

542
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
homeostasis all blood cells have

543
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,840
lifespan and are constantly being

544
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,840
replaced with new young healthy vibrant

545
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
cells

546
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,280
okay so

547
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,400
also i knew what each tube was being

548
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,960
drawn for which tests

549
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,000
with which color tube to the

550
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,760
phlebotomist only fills them half full

551
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
i like celery juice and don't trust big

552
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,559
pharma but this is

553
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,679
not but this but this take is not it

554
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,080
um a couple things first of all just so

555
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,039
you know

556
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
right so when someone has cancer okay

557
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,000
and they're getting blood draws

558
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,039
constantly losing their white count

559
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,600
that attacks cancer cells and

560
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,360
the bone marrow issue that you're taking

561
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
the bone marrow with producing like

562
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,799
often replenishing your blood so quickly

563
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,200
is not true

564
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
even science research will tell you when

565
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,600
you donate blood

566
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,600
you're four to six six weeks out for

567
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,360
your red count to come back

568
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,760
just letting you know you're four to six

569
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,039
weeks at least

570
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,480
so science and research like the head of

571
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,640
science and research

572
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,840
okay dictates that with a blood donation

573
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,720
you're four to six weeks out of getting

574
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
your red blood cells back up to par

575
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
just giving you that one right there to

576
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,600
begin with

577
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,360
that's at least four to six weeks okay

578
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240
of course you're gonna get white blood

579
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,919
cells popping out of your spleen

580
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,679
immediately that were stored in your

581
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,080
spleen right when you

582
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,880
get a right when you get um any kind of

583
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,160
procedure

584
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,720
or blood drawn or um

585
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,760
or anything like that okay so but the

586
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
thing is is that

587
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,720
your bone marrow has to go on overload

588
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,880
to produce those cells

589
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,919
and it doesn't produce them all

590
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,799
perfectly

591
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,400
because you have stored cells in certain

592
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,679
places right you have them stored in

593
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
your spleen

594
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
you have them stored in other areas of

595
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,240
the body and those are your reserves

596
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,679
now you're lucky if you're seeing

597
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
anything like that

598
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,440
but then you got somebody with lyme

599
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,320
disease and they're getting their blood

600
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,720
draws

601
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
okay and they're getting worse and worse

602
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
and worse

603
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,799
and neurological symptoms are getting

604
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,640
worse and worse and worse

605
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,640
and you're getting somebody with c with

606
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
with me cfs and their symptoms are

607
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,160
getting worse and worse as they're

608
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,799
taking seven vials 14 vials

609
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,240
28 vials 30 vials okay and their

610
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,160
symptoms are getting worse and worse and

611
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520
worse finally they're bedridden

612
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
because their immune system has been

613
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,760
removed and

614
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,120
they're low-grade viral infections that

615
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
give them all their different symptoms

616
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,960
aches and pains tingles

617
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,159
numbness fatigue twitches spasms burning

618
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,200
skin

619
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,240
brain fog eye floaters vertigo

620
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,280
is getting worse worse worse worse okay

621
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,000
and people like that they can lose

622
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,520
everything

623
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
okay you should listen to the podcast

624
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,400
episode to hear all the information

625
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,960
really important to know but don't

626
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
assume

627
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,840
that our our bone marrow just replaces

628
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,559
it all every time we draw it out

629
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,320
um that's not true it's just not true

630
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,000
it's not

631
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,679
because each person has a different

632
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
story so

633
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,679
most people with autoimmune have a

634
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,799
weakened immune system already so what

635
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,640
does that mean

636
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,240
weakened immune system because they're

637
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
already diagnosed with an autoimmune

638
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,720
condition

639
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,360
and if they already have a weakened

640
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,039
immune system that means we have a bone

641
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,000
marrow issue to some degree

642
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,720
where we're not producing what we need

643
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
to

644
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,960
need to produce on the level we need to

645
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,559
produce to keep up with what's happening

646
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,360
inside the body so you got to keep that

647
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,120
in mind

648
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,559
so anybody with any kind of autoimmune

649
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,360
condition at all

650
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,960
that happens jim says in my experience

651
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,120
if the blood is dark purple

652
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,799
almost black it would not hurt to lose a

653
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,799
couple few tubes

654
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
of dirty blood refreshed with clear

655
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,840
eating habits

656
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,120
agree not good to draw blood with

657
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
cancerous conditions

658
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
fasting can save you your life as long

659
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,240
as the cancer

660
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,919
is not too advanced um

661
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,120
so first of all they're not doing two

662
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,960
vials jim so

663
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
it's not doing two vials that's not

664
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
usually what happens

665
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,760
you get sick you don't feel good it's

666
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,039
five vials you get sick you don't feel

667
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,720
good at seven vials

668
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,159
get sick you don't feel good it's 14

669
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
vials then you're at now you're at a

670
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,840
specialist and it's 20 vials

671
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
that specialist after you're burnt out

672
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
that specialist and that specialist

673
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,720
burnt out you six months later

674
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,640
after you've already dumped about 20

675
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
vials three times with that specialist

676
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
now you're off to a new specialist but

677
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,720
he doesn't care about all the blood work

678
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
you just had so he's going to pull

679
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,320
another 20 vials

680
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,440
and another 28 vials and another 40

681
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,840
vials okay

682
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,480
this is killing women this is killing

683
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
women

684
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,559
so what happens is they'll draw 20 40

685
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,559
vials out of a 120 pound female

686
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,039
they'll sin they'll draw the same amount

687
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,840
of blood out of a 250 pound

688
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,280
male okay so you got a female that's

689
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,360
sick with chronic illness

690
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
could barely function severe chronic

691
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,400
fatigue 122 pounds

692
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,400
and they'll draw 30 tubes out of her and

693
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
you've got a 220 pound male

694
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,760
and they'll draw 32 30 tubes out of him

695
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,440
and so you know there's there's a lot of

696
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
problems that need to address it's not

697
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
as simple as how you got some dark

698
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,559
you got some dark blood it'd be good to

699
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,559
draw it a couple of vials

700
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
fresh blood coming in the reason why

701
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,400
it's dark is because

702
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,159
the liver is toxic number one and the

703
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,640
blood is dehydrated

704
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
that's why so if your blood comes out

705
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,919
dark purple

706
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:03,200
dark dark dark color red really dark

707
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,280
that is the chronic dehydration so

708
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
just giving you that information so you

709
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,400
can protect yourself

710
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
all on its own it's chronic dehydration

711
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,159
and a dirty liver

712
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,919
you can pull out that blood all you want

713
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,960
fresh blood just doesn't come in and

714
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,960
you're all fine

715
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
your liver is toxic stagnant sluggish

716
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
and dirty and your blood's dehydrated so

717
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,200
you got to go into hydration and then

718
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,520
you gotta go cleaning up the liver and

719
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,240
fasting doesn't fix everything

720
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
it doesn't uh and there's a big history

721
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
to that

722
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,400
okay and uh fasting doesn't fix

723
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,280
everything

724
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
i've seen fasting hurt people too it's

725
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,120
not just fix

726
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
them deplete them and hurt them so i've

727
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,919
seen

728
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,200
fasting do that to people you know

729
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
deplete them

730
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
they lose all their neurotransmitters

731
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,480
all their electrolytes

732
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,960
they lose it all and i never recommend

733
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
for

734
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
central nervous system conditions like

735
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,240
neurological symptoms for people to fast

736
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
long at all so

737
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,080
any kind of fasting long term while

738
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,799
you're dealing with neurological

739
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,919
symptoms

740
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,960
can be disastrous and dangerous so

741
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,720
there's a lot of

742
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,320
a lot of problems with a lot of that

743
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,400
stuff it's like

744
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,919
yeah there is something you said about

745
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,120
fasting emergency

746
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,000
cases small amounts of time but it's

747
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
another things that

748
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,919
you're fasting long term and you just

749
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,840
don't understand how the body works it's

750
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,279
a whole other thing too all on its own

751
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,760
look i'm not saying that you don't have

752
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,559
some good info somewhere that's not it

753
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
but we're talking 35 years experiencing

754
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,720
i've seen everybody fast under the sun

755
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
i've done long-term water fast because i

756
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,480
wanted to do it spiritually

757
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,679
okay so i've done really long-term water

758
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,559
fasting

759
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
really long-term water fasting not

760
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,039
because of a condition

761
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,520
because spiritually doing it okay and i

762
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,400
did that

763
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
okay but i was strong as an ox when i

764
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,520
did that

765
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,960
so when i did long-term water fasting

766
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,480
for fun

767
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,799
i did it while strong as an ox

768
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,559
and not only strong as an ox for

769
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,360
spiritual reasons

770
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,960
but i would i when it comes down to

771
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,320
people they got neurological symptoms

772
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159

but doing it right two days doing it

782
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
right if there's a really good reason

783
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,760
for

784
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,880
it um but anyway

785
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,080
it's all good stuff so uh

786
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,679

787
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,279
medical media podcast apple podcast

788
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,559
check out that episode

789
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,480
um we're gonna talk about some other

790
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,520
things really quick right here too so

791
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,960
um let's go into that so here's the

792
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
here's how it works okay your immune

793
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
system is not all in your gut

794
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,240
just we got to clear that up right now

795
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,640
okay because that's the new thing

796
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
missed information that's trendy that's

797
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,440
always

798
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,000
out there because money is behind it you

799
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,200
just gotta know every single trend

800
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,960
out there that gets out there and it's

801
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,880
pounding its way out there like your

802
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,279
immune system is all in your gut is only

803
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
done

804
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,000
or sold or propelled by gut health

805
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
companies and probiotic companies and

806
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
that's how they do it

807
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,559
and they find some pseudoscience in

808
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,919
order to do that pseudoscience is just

809
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,640
science they pay for

810
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,000
to back up their little claim that this

811
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,760
product is good for them

812
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,520
and then they go with a theory and they

813
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,799
don't even have the science to prove it

814
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
and you just go with a theory the immune

815
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,880
system is all

816
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
and you're good you say well there's

817
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,240
trillions of microorganisms in the gut

818
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
so if there's trillions of

819
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
microorganisms in the intestinal tract

820
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,799
and the colon

821
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,640
small intestinal tract and there's

822
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,400
trillions of microorganisms

823
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,159
then we that's that's where the immune

824
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,520
system is but that's not your immune

825
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,600
system

826
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
in fact far from it okay your immune

827
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
system is

828
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,919
first of all in your bloodstream that's

829
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,799
your number one place so when you get

830
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,200
your blood draw

831
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,640
you lose your number one most important

832
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
immune system now why is it in the

833
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
bloodstream

834
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,520
it's in the bloodstream to protect what

835
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,400
right here it's in the bloodstream to

836
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,919
protect your

837
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
brain okay that's why that's why your

838
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
immune system's in your bloodstream

839
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
it's to protect your brain critical this

840
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
is why

841
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,919
someone you hear about this all the time

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,559

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,799
sense you really make you are amazing

937
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,960
and you have so many people that love

938
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,720
everything you share and have truly

939
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,559
made a seal pressing prince thanks so

940
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,000
much pretty cool

941
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,720
amy mm healed me doctors did not

942
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
i mean but you know what happens that

943
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,520
person

944
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
never got sick enough right so that's

945
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
how it works you guys

946
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,840
that's how it works they never got sick

947
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,600
enough they haven't they probably just

948
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
got a little sick

949
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,360
and then they went to a couple of

950
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,559
functional medicine doctors that gave

951
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,159
them some tips

952
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,600
and some things that were probably

953
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,880
partly on them because functional

954
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,480
medicine uses medical mean

955
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
information now they never did before

956
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,200
the publications of the books

957
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,799
but they use it now right and so a lot

958
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,080
of different practitioners and doctors

959
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,240
they use mm info

960
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,440
so they're probably just skating by okay

961
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,600
they don't need to go too

962
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,279
far through healing they don't have to

963
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,840
really take it too seriously

964
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,720
because they're not really that sick and

965
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
but if they get

966
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,240
really sick down the road they'll be

967
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,799
back here you know spirit of compassion

968
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,200
told me

969
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,039
a long time ago when i was young that

970
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
you know what even the skeptics still

971
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,519
have to try to

972
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,760
find the truth and the answers in the

973
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,279
end if they get sick enough

974
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,960
and they're stuck on mattress island

975
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,080
then they have to just swallow their

976
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,080
pride

977
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,000
realize science totally screwed them

978
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,399
over and didn't have the answers

979
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,159
and then they have to find their way so

980
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,760
yeah

981
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,200
look anyway let's talk about this a

982
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,360
little bit more you guys

983
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,320
so your your immune system is in your

984
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,080
blood oh

985
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,559
so wait a minute that's interesting

986
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
because um

987
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,919
most of your immune system is in your

988
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,919
blood but i guess you'll just

989
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,279
go trust someone some other person

990
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,399
because how can you trust me

991
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,679
you'll trust some other person that

992
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,519
doesn't know your immune system is in

993
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,200
your blood that's interesting right

994
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,799
this is unbelievable you'll trust

995
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
somebody that doesn't even have a clue

996
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,679
let's just draw lots of blood out of you

997
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,880
every single month

998
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,120
let's drain you dry and blood let you

999
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,039
anyway the immune system's in your blood

1000
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,399
and there's a reason for that

1001
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,000
and it goes through all the different

1002
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,360
blood vessels to protect your heart so

1003
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,320
that's another thing too

1004
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,440
so that's your little heart right there

1005
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,279
okay

1006
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,240
and in those blood vessels and those

1007
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,960
tiny arteries

1008
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,760
blood vessels right you have your immune

1009
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
system

1010
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,360
it's critical that's what protects you

1011
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,840
from getting blood

1012
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,640
poisoning because that's why your immune

1013
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,440
system

1014
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:26,399
system is mostly in your blood to stop

1015
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,880
you from getting sepsis to stop you from

1016
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,120
getting

1017
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
blood poisoning that's the key that's

1018
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,080
another really important part right

1019
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,039
there so

1020
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,480
um another thing too blood going through

1021
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,559
your heart

1022
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,519
has to has to have a strong immune

1023
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,000
system

1024
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,320
so you don't get infected valves so you

1025
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,159
don't get infections to the heart

1026
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,760
so the reason why our immune system is

1027
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,080
in in our bloodstream

1028
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,519
ninety percent of it the most majority

1029
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,880
of our immune system is in our

1030
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,240
bloodstream is so you don't get an

1031
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,000
infection in your heart

1032
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,000
and you don't get an infection in your

1033
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,919
brain two places that you

1034
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
have to know that are so important right

1035
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,440
there okay and then

1036
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,640
the second most important place your

1037
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
immune system is

1038
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,000
after that is your liver so there you go

1039
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,960
see your liver

1040
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,480
that's the second most important spot as

1041
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,360
your liver and that's where the immune

1042
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,080
system is

1043
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,480
okay the second most important spot your

1044
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,159
immune system is all right

1045
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,799
third most important spot is your

1046
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,360
lymphatic system but that's a third

1047
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,880
okay second is your liver and i'll talk

1048
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,559
about the lymphatic system for a second

1049
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,159
to you guys your lymphatic system is

1050
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,720
only as good as your liver

1051
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,919
keep that in mind all right so and it's

1052
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,320
only a small amount

1053
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,840
of lymphocytes in your lymphatic system

1054
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,279
so that's not the majority of your

1055
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,559
immune system

1056
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,960
and but what happens is that the liver

1057
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,720
is has to stay healthy for your

1058
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
lymphatic system to be healthy so when

1059
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
everybody's trying to cleanse their

1060
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,760
lymphatic system what they're really

1061
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,519
doing

1062
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,120
by accident sometimes some of those

1063
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,600
different things they do

1064
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,039
is it's oh hey i want a juice hey i want

1065
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,880
to do some juicing now

1066
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,640
and try to cleanse my lymphatic system

1067
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,039
when they don't get it their juicing

1068
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,120
is helping to cleanse their liver and

1069
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,000
that's how you get a lymphatic system

1070
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
more healthy it

1071
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,399
has to be the liver because you can't

1072
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,679
just you can do all the lymphatic work

1073
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,480
you want you can get all the lymph

1074
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,839
massage

1075
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
you can get all the d you can do

1076
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,399
everything you can possibly do you can

1077
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,280
be a runner

1078
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,879
okay and you can like i love to run you

1079
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,599
can be like a runner

1080
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,560
and that's what you do you run 15 miles

1081
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,359
a day

1082
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,240
you're like okay just ran 15 20 miles

1083
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,159
i'm good

1084
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,320
i got my lymphatic system moving because

1085
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,119
i'm exercising but if your liver's

1086
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,560
dirty your lymphatic system never cleans

1087
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,159
up does it matter if you're a runner

1088
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,639
does it matter if you're an athlete

1089
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
doesn't matter if you work out every day

1090
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,000
if you don't

1091
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,119
keep the liver clean your lymphatic

1092
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,599
system can never

1093
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,919
clean it can never get cleaned up

1094
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,720
lymphatic system is the second blood

1095
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,359
filter in the blood lymph filter after

1096
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,280
the liver so the first one is the liver

1097
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,440
after that it's the lymphatic system so

1098
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,680
everybody's like oh my lymphatic system

1099
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,000
is the most important thing you know

1100
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,119
it's all lymph lymph actually no

1101
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,440
no it's not it's liver liver liver

1102
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,839
that's your filter when that filter gets

1103
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,520
dirty your lymphatic system

1104
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,520
is just trashed that's how it works you

1105
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,079
can't keep up with that lymphatic system

1106
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,000
ever

1107
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,599
unless the liver is addressed so that's

1108
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,280
important too so

1109
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,880
you can be doing like all the lymphatic

1110
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,680
stuff you want but when you're eating

1111
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,520
like too much

1112
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,119
like chicken and cookies because

1113
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,480
chicken's too high in fat

1114
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
when you're having your ice cream bars

1115
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,079
you're needing too many eggs you're

1116
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,480
having your eggs right

1117
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,160
when you're eating things that feed bugs

1118
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,800
and feed pathogens

1119
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,320
okay and they clog up the liver too and

1120
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,839
you get a lot of different exposures to

1121
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
the liver so you got like

1122
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,440
air fresheners you're breathing in goes

1123
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,640
right into the liver scented candles

1124
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,800
right into the liver

1125
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,200
right you know whatever it is you just

1126
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,040
absorbs right into the liver

1127
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,119
different chemicals different toxins

1128
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,280
cleaners all that difference of clones

1129
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,760
perfumes right goes right into the liver

1130
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,200
and so when you have that that perfume

1131
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
you're spraying that perfume the minute

1132
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,800
you breathe it in ends up in the liver

1133
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,079
first that's where it will end up

1134
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
you'll end up in your mouth you'll

1135
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,200
swallow it goes down into your digestive

1136
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,119

into the liver

1139
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,720
and so what the critical thing to

1140
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,119
understand is

1141
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,760
is that there's all the lymphatic hubbub

1142

1205
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,960
another

1206
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,960
16 tubes right right and they're then

1210
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,119
but this 55 year old right is playing

1211
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,119
tennis

1212
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,200

1214
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,079
with her his friends guts a mess filled

1215
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,000
with all kinds of crap you think there's

1216
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,040
good microorganisms in that gut of that

1217
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,640
person no what it is is they don't

1218
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,839
happen to have a virus

1219
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,040
or a pathogen or the right kind of strap

1220
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,520
or hhv-6 hhv-7 simplexes

1221
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,200
or they don't have enough viruses

1222
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,560
shingles ebv

1223
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,400
wreaking enough havoc yet in their life

1224
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,640
and a 22 year old can be loaded with

1225
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,680
epstein barr and it's totally taking her

1226
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,160
him down

1227
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,240
boom down and they could be on a clean

1228
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,720
diet unless they know what to do unless

1229
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
they know

1230
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,079
how to clean it up unless they know how

1231
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,480
to take care of themselves and

1232
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,359
and and know what protocols to use you

1233
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,680
know

1234
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,400
and know how it works mm is just not

1235
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,320
about

1236
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,440
some celery juice it's not just about

1237
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
food it's about

1238
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,599
important protocols you know it's about

1239
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,520
the right kind of vitamin c that's the

1240
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,720
micro see right there that i use

1241
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,440
not sponsored it's about having details

1242
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,680
and knowing

1243
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,760
how to use things you know and that's

1244
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,599
important we can play gut health games

1245
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,119
all we want but if we don't have the

1246
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,119
right stuff

1247
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,040
you know and then we get in trouble and

1248
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,040
that that's what happens you know like

1249
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,160
here's the cat's claw that's the vimergy

1250
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,800
cat's claw right there

1251
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,960
that that i love love the vimergy cats

1252
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,960
club because for lyme disease

1253
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
that's what i taught doctors that use

1254
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,839
for the last 35 years it's cat's claw

1255
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,839
and there wasn't a product like this out

1256
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,240
at the time just wasn't a product like

1257
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,560
this

1258
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,920
good out there would have to get the

1259
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,599
dried cat's claw i remember 25 years ago

1260
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,839
i'd have the dried cat's call in my

1261
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,359
office and doctors would be calling me

1262
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,280
up be like for my patients do you have

1263
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,640
any more of that dried cat's claw

1264
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,319
tea do you have any more of that i'll be

1265
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,960
like send it out to you i'll get it out

1266
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,400
to you

1267
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,480
and it's like but we didn't have

1268
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,440
anything like this you know like the

1269
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,400
vimergy

1270
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,240
um it's important to know so that's

1271
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,280
critical right there are the b12 energy

1272
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,280
b12

1273
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,079
so gut health is this blanket term right

1274
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,040
now to sell

1275
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,520
to sell products and then to lie to

1276
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,119
people

1277
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,040
you know it's like your immune system is

1278
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,359
all in your gut it's a theory

1279
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,560
it's not actual truth there's no truth

1280
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,760
they haven't figured it out

1281
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
scientifically

1282
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,599
it's made up but it's made up for the

1283
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,839
gut health companies you know

1284
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
and meanwhile you can go on like the

1285
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,240
merry-go-round and you're looking for

1286
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
help and you're

1287
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,400
you're at the next doctor and he's got

1288
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,960
you off the wrong foods

1289
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,319
he's got you you know doing different

1290
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,520
things he's got you on gut health

1291
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,880
products you might improve because he

1292
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,480
gets you off of some gluten

1293
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,079
and some dairy products or some

1294
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,520
processed food

1295
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,880
but then you know then you know you get

1296
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,280
a little better because you're not

1297
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,079
feet you're not feeding too many

1298
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,000
pathogens

1299
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,200
maybe the doctor gets you off of gluten

1300
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480

people right

1326
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,680

patients to me and and

1328
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:11,040

just droves of college students

1330
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,240
that never finished college not because

1331
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,599
they didn't want to

1332
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,839
they couldn't go out with their friends

now more than ever before

1338
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,560
nobody talks about it right but someone

1339
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
would come on here like a naysayer like

1340
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,040
a hater like

1341
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,800

1348
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,280
right

1349
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,160

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,920
hundreds of thousands of college

students never finished college

1353
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,400

1363
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,480

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,119
but i take it because i can you know

1440
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,920
it's like

1441
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,400
when you know when you know too much

1442
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,640
about

1443
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,240
what's going on you know too much about

1444
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,839
everything i mean i might end up in a

1445
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,760
public bathroom somewhere

1446
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,440
right where it's like you just you're

1447
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,119
just stuck out and you're

1448
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,640
out somewhere and you're with some

1449
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,440
friends or some family and you're like

1450
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,839
well

1451
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,040
nature calls man you know now you're in

1452
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,200
a public bathroom

1453
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,319
anyway so i just take you know i i

1454
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,240
always take these things but

1455
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,599
what i do is i take two dropper fulls of

1456
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,200
cats call a day personally

1457
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,640
i that's what i take every day i just

1458
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,240
take two two dropper fulls

1459
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,800
sometimes i'll take a break for a little

1460
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,240
while um

1461
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,280
april says cat's claw makes my joints

1462
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,480
hurt

1463
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,920
um well did you ever have joint pain

1464
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,920
before or that's the

1465
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,319
only time so no joint pain no body pain

1466
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,079
joints never hurt at all ever i just

1467
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,520
want you to be your own detective right

1468
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,359
so i'm just that's why i'm just

1469
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,760
mentioning this right um

1470
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,280
so nothing ever hurt before and then you

1471
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,000
took the cat's claw and all sent your

1472
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,599
joints hurt

1473
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,800
or do your joints hurt periodically

1474
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,480
because you already have a problem and

1475
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,760
that's why you're taking cat's claw or

1476
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,520
trying to find the next

1477
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,119
new thing to help you heal and all that

1478
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,920
just really important question right

1479
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,240
there

1480
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,119
the other thing is did it have alcohol

1481
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,520
in it

1482
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,119
