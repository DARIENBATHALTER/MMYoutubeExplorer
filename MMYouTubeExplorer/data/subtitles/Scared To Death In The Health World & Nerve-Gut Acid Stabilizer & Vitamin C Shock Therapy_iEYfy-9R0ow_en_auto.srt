1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,160
nerve gut stabilizer that's why you see

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,279
all this parsley in front of me right

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,960
here an incredible medical medium tool

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,240
mind-blowing actually because it

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,799
actually heals the body and moves people

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,000
forward I want to read about that a

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,320
little bit also doing the vitamin C

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,160
shock therapy that is a powerful tool

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,119
we're going into a time period right now

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,800
a lot of bugs going around the whole bit

11
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,920
people come down the flu and all kinds

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,920
of different stuff and the C and all

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,599
kinds of stuff and RSV everything people

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
are actually getting stuff so so guess

15
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,320
what vitamin C shock therapy should be

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,440
doing it every single day if you need to

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,800

79
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,319
irresponsible in nature so it's

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,840
irresponsible in the way they're doing

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,920

82
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,920

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,400
death to get a click a like and so forth

89
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,319
that's how it's going right now there's

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,159

91
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,400
response to it so I'm giving you the

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,000
prediction right now so it's going to

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,879
happen there's going to be a huge flip

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
might take a year or two maybe a little

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,959
longer but a huge flip where people are

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,159
going to be sick to death of it they are

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,319
they're going to be sick of it but right

98
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,799
now people are getting a high off of it

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,799

100
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,079

it's every influencer that's the new

154
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:10,680
tactic with

155
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:14,960
no ways of helping people get through it

156
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,759
no good answers on how to heal no

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,000

children none of that is there it's just

160
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,960
caffeine's bad caffeine's going to kill

161
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,080
you medical mem information but you so

162
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,199
so many Trends and traps out there

163
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,160
instead they throw you in

164
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,520
it's like caffeine's bad do this and

165
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,759
what they give you sucks this is bad do

166
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:44,039
salt and water that sucks this is this

167
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,599
is bad do my do my carnivore packet of

168
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,080
protein it's got junk and [ __ ] in it do

169
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:53,599
this is bad then do this it's so that's

170
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,680
what's happening right now it's all a

171
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,000
method methodology on scaring the [ __ ]

172
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,199
out of people scaring them to death then

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,120
getting them to buy whatever it is

174
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,319
they're selling that's the tactic and

175
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,360
guess what it's going to get old pretty

176
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,960
quick it's already starting to get old

177
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,240
but that's the tactic by my program

178
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,400
because guess what this is going to

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,120

434
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,760

441
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,799
having major issues right now A lot of

442
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,600
people are reporting getting kicked off

443
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,360
the live streams they won't let people

444
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,919
on the screen and it's

445
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,600
freezing and that's what they've done to

446
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,679
Medical medium we have reached out to ig

447
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,919
for that and they turn off sound as well

448
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,000
so if you're even hearing me on IG

449
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:46,440
because they've really just I can see

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,120
they kicked at

451
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,919
least they kicked at least a th000

452
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,240
people off for sure so they're keeping

453
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,360
the number somewhere around 400 and

454
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,320
everybody's reporting how they're

455
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,360
getting kicked off if you're

456
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,679
experiencing this please report it to us

457
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:06,400
in the D Ms okay so we can use that data

458
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:08,799
we can use that data um to help defend

459
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,559
ourselves from the IG kickoff today

460
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
because that's what they're doing

461
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,880
they're kicking people off and you know

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,400
it makes sense because somebody you know

463
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,360
working there probably is really jealous

464
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,080

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,440

go away with a probiotic either I'm

507
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,240
sorry but it doesn't but what happens is

508
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,720
in the microbiome world all this stuff

509
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,840
is thrown together all this different

510
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,880
stuff you know including like ACV

511
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,720
gummies and things like that it's all

512
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,440
just slapped together with a bunch of

513
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,200
crap in it and there's so many things

514
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,320
out there for the microbiome world and

515
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,360
people are still stuck they're stuck so

516
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,600
stuck so bad that all these dudes tried

517
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,120
all that and then they went to carnivore

518
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,520
and I'll talk about that another day and

519
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,159
then they go to carnivore because it's

520
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,640
called process elimination where they're

521
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,559
totally screwed and they don't know what

522
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,960
to eat anymore they're afraid of this

523
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,279
afraid of that and they start narrowing

524
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,919
it down to just meat and meat only they

525
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,360
tried all the microbiome products they

526
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,200
tried all the different protein patterns

527
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,240
they tried everything to do to help

528
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,640
their gut in some way some fashion some

529
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,880
shape some form goes nowhere and now

530
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,279
they're just stuck with a piece of meat

531
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,640
they realize they're bumping against the

532
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,080
wall they got nowhere to go with this

533
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,120
process elimination so now they're

534
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,720
adding fruit and they're adding honey

535
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,640
and adding lemon and stuff like that to

536
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,720
try to crawl out of it so they're just

537
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,039
going back to a keto diet basically with

538
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,120
with fruit and

539
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,840
meat so what I'm trying to say overall

540
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,760
that's just one example so many other

541
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,279
examples of people losing their ability

542
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
to eat the things that they want to eat

543
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,240
and they're stuck they don't know where

544
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,240
to go they can't eat this lettuce they

545
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,480
can't eat that they can't eat this herb

546
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,440
they can't and they're just getting

547
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,799
knocked down to just basically

548
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,480
oatmeal all of a sudden they're on

549
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,480
oatmeal and oatmeal only I'm saying this

550
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,799
because there are people out there and I

551
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,600
see that there young influencers out

552
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,360
there that people bring to my attention

553
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,480
and say look at this person this

554
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,760
person's really suffering they're just

555
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,159
on oatmeal like that's the saddest thing

556
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
I've ever seen only on oatmeal because

557
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,880
they don't know what to eat know what to

558
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,520
do know how to heal know how to recover

559
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,919
and it just gets all taken away from

560
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,000
them and they don't know what they're

561
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,840
reacting to and it just goes Boop Bo

562
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,360
Boop and now they're just on oatmeal and

563
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,520
that's it plus a microbiome product and

564
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,279
so forth and everything there's a ton of

565
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,960
this kind of stuff going on out there

566
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,960
meanwhile if they only knew medical

567
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,840
medium information and they knew about

568
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:18,320
the nerve gut acid stabilizer okay then

569
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,320
things can change so what I have in

570
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,919
front of me right here is nerve gut acid

571
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
stabilizer so I'm going to show you

572
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,799
right here if they only knew about these

573
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,919
things life could be so different when

574
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,039
you use the nerve good acid stabilizer

575
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,480
on a on a regular basis Miracles

576
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,200
actually happen for so many people it's

577
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,159
really a very special special thing and

578
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,799
that's a medical medium brain shot

00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,360
therapy which is the brainsaver protocol

580
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,440
book and

581
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,440
then people are sick because of

582
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,159

vitamin C vitamin C is critical for the

609
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:14,279
immune system it just is so critical

610
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,679
that if you were on a ship out in the

611
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:21,600
ocean for a long time

612
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:25,799
eating beef

613
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,640
jerky you will fall apart fall apart

614
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,760
it's why carnivore people can't eat meat

615
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,159
there's no vitamin C no vitamin C it's

616
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,720
why if you're actually eating meat for

617
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,600
two years your Skin's going to look like

618
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,679
crap in five

619
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,080
years that's why the carnivore diet

620
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,159
isn't the carnivore diet anymore they

621
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,440
just try to use the name carnivore diet

622
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,919
is just a keto diet with fruit it's meat

623
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,399
and fruit now I'm saying this because if

624
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:54,880
you don't put the fruit in there and get

625
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:58,360
any vitamin C you're screwed you're

626
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,279
screwed you will fall apart your body

627
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,039
your connective tissue you can't just be

628
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,760
on meat and this isn't coming from a

629
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,279
plant-based situation I'm not saying

630
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,880
that you got to be all plant-based you

631
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:12,720
can't eat meat that's not it at all I'm

632
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,120
saying you will be so totally

633
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,480
screwed your body will fall apart your

634
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,360
collagen will fall apart yes doesn't

635
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,200
matter how much protein you think you're

636
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,919
getting everything's going to fall

637
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:31,919
apart you have to have vitamin C

638
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,919
vitamin

639
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,440
C gotta contain

640
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,960
myself because the amount of stupidity

641
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,000
in the health realm is so bad and it's

642
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,640
never ending I've been watching it for

643
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,279
decades it's never ending Lauren moch

644
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,799
over there yes I was in the hospital

645
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,399
from gastritis they sent me home with

646
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,720
medicine took one pill and then

647
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:01,240
discovered the nerve gut stabilizer shot

648
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,760
worked better didn't have to take my any

649
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,000
more medicine after that's incredible

650
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:12,200
Lauren it is and I think what happens

651
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,720
with people okay is there's a lot of

652
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,480
people in the health movement they they

653
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,440
they lack the experience because they

654
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,159
haven't been truly that sick yet so

655
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,760
their influencers built on health

656
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,480
because they have an interest in it but

657
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,399
they haven't been that sick yet they

658
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,679
will down the road I know one who's a

659
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,279
podcast person right now

660
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,200
it's a pretty well-known podcast to a

661
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,159
degree and they're just eating meat

662
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,320
right now they're in the process or

663
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,440
she's just eating meat yeah because

664
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,279
she's getting sick getting desperate had

665
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,200
to do the elimination process and get

666
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,799
down to just meat because she heard

667
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,159
about you she carnivore people on there

668
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,039
and then she's going to have to go from

669
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,600
there and eventually add fruit something

670
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,559
she was afraid of all these years the

671
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,080
point is is no matter what if you're a

672
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,720
health person influencer health

673
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,480
podcaster or whoever it is and you

674
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,679
haven't been sick enough you lack a

675
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
tremendous amount of experience you

676
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,279
might say you were sick but you might

677
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,640
not have been that sick you really

678
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,919
weren't that

679
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,919
sick and so what happens is people

680
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,080
with less

681
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,679
experience about what's going on with

682
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,600
the chronic Leo and being sick are out

683
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,720
there running the scene I call them the

684
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,519
health slum Lords they run the scene

685
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,240
they dominate the scene they take take

686
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,080
over they got a lot of money they can

687
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,399
throw the money around they can throw it

688
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,799
into teams of people doing a ton of work

689
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,039
and then they haven't been sick enough

690
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,600
they don't know the experience with

691
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,559
chronic illness they don't understand

692
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,080
and then they sit there just throwing

693
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:53,240
out stuff like feal matter implant

694
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,600
disastrous yeah disastrous like other

stabilizer all this is important and

728
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:16,120
once again why do I care why do I care

729
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,919
you know I care because I see The

730
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:21,960
Chronic Ill get affected and get stomped

731
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:25,159
on constantly out there it's pain

732
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,919
staking I see them get tricked I see

733
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:29,120
them swimming in all kinds of trends

734
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,559
that don't work

735
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,480
it's every day out there and they're

736
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:37,799
getting lured in by microbiome talk

737
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,039
they're getting lured in by

738
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:44,320
flash shiny things and shiny

739
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,840
objects and they don't

740
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,880
realize about like something like the

741
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,720
vitamin C shock

742
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,320
therapy if you're somebody who's got any

743
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,919
kind of symptom any kind of problem

744
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,519
whatever it is your immune system needs

745
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,799
help bottom line

746
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:03,720
your immune system needs assistance now

747
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:05,840
we have like assistance to destroy our

748
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,000
immune systems it's everywhere we're up

749
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,559
against all kinds of stuff that's what

750
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,760
we do on planet Earth and there's plenty

751
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,840
of assistance to that like we can just

752
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,480
annihilate our immune system in so many

753
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,559
different ways very simply just caffeine

754
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,760
alone is an immune system Destroyer

755
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:28,000
caffeine alone okay that's an immune

756
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,720
system Destroyer just like when a mom is

757
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,159
on caffeine while pregnant and the

758
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,279
baby's immune system gets compromised

759
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,840
from that

760
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,519
caffeine but there's an answer to that

761
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,679
moms have to look out and become aware

762
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,440
and not do caffeine on any level moms

763
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:49,000
should not be eating

764
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,320
chocolate chocolate is harmful for the

765
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,840
baby extremely harmful for the baby I

766
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,399
talked about this for years you guys

767
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:59,039
might remember maybe some of you don't

768
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:01,080
but chocolate is really bad during a

769
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,600
pregnancy and I look if somebody just

770
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,559
asked a book on in I just saw right

771
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,960
there brain saver protocols there it is

772
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:10,799
okay all

773
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,639
right immune system problems are rampant

774
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,919
immune cells are actually struggling in

775
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,760
human kind right now it's it's actually

776
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,559
the biggest thing happening you don't

777
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,519
hear it as the biggest thing happening

778
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,360
you don't you hear other things like

779
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,960
processed foods are the biggest problem

780
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,399
on planet Earth processed foods aren't

781
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,559
the biggest problem on planet Earth and

782
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:33,559
like I said before you take processed

783
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,320
foods away from people they will find it

784
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,200
one way or another just like moonshine

785
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,159
just like prohibition just like when

786
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,399
they removed alcohol out of people's

787
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,279
hands back in the 20s and 30s just like

788
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,960
when they did that people were just

789
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,840
brewing their own moonshine in the woods

790
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,600
and that's what they did they consumed

791
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,080
it that way because they're going to

792
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,039
find it no matter what if they want it

793
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,760
lra 144 Anthony I did the nerve gut ask

799
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,880
Gratitude October 21st 22nd 23rd 24th

800
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,799
which night do you have it's going to be

801
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,399
really

802
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,159
fun so I want to make the vitamin C

803
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,600
shock therapy

804
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,760
critical for so many people I want to

805
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,760
read about it a little bit too

806
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:35,840
okay over there

807
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:41,000
[ __ ] um still freezing up over

808
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,360
there keeps on freezing up the screen

809
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,919
okay all right so we're talking about

810
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,600
medical medium vitamin C shock

811
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,159
therapy why does medical medium vitamin

812
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,880
C shock therapy bring healing to a new

813
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,399
level because it takes a a specific type

814
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,880
of glucose attached to that vitamin C so

815
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,399
here's another thing that's important

816
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,039
right here nutrients

817
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,600
antioxidants they need a

818
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,960
sugar to travel far they need a sugar to

819
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:13,919
travel far that's part of the healing

820
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,079
that is part of the healing they need

821
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,960
glucose to enter cells so when you're

822
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:23,280
using something to beat something and to

823
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,280
heal and recover and move past illness

824
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,720
and you need something like that making

825
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,879
that work is is even part of how you

826
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,879
heal how do you make that even work when

827
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:36,440
you need something and you can get a

828
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,280
hold of it you can take it to another

829
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,399
level to make it work so the vitamin C

830
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,320
shock therapy and I have the vimergy

831
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,520
micro C powder right here by the way

832
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,679
this in combination of the MSM I don't

833
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,800
know if you guys

834
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:56,440

835
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,720

that I can't say that that's something

841
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,560
dangerous to say if it wasn't true

842
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,480
because guess what wherever I got that

843
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,960

medical Med information remember medical

894
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,440

you can't get collagen from eating

897
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,359
collagen you can't just eat collagen and

898
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,640
you grow collagen and develop collagen

899
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,040
produce collagen doesn't work you can't

900
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,680
eat a sheep's eyeball to fix your

901
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,240

produce collagen somehow in you but

910
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,800
guess what the health industry made that

911
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,040
massive mistake I mean I was laughing at

912
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,800
that for years it's painful because the

913
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,400
amount of collagen people purchased and

914
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,800
thought they were doing something for

915
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,720
themselves and the amount of like super

916
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,640
models out there talking about how their

917
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,839
collagen all that collagen is helping

918
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,359
them and everything you know meanwhile

919
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,839
they're getting you know they're getting

920
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,720
exfoliations and facials day in and day

921
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,079
out and day in and day out the point is

922
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,160
is collagen doesn't build collagen and

923
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,119
no disrespect to supermodels of course

924
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,000
but but collagen doesn't build collagen

925
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,800
it doesn't you need building blocks so

926
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
medical beam information was about the

927
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,839
building blocks to collagen that was the

928
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,079
whole point there about putting that

929
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:14,240
information out first and one of those

930
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,200
building blocks is Vitamin C you care

931
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,560
about your skin than vitamin C now you

932
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,480
may not care about your skin and that's

933
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,000
fine so care about your immune system

934
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,480
though especially when there's all kinds

935
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,880
of stuff going around especially when

936
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,280
you got symptoms and conditions you got

937
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,079
symptoms you're struggling you got a

938
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,839
condition your immune system struggling

939
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,520
that's how it works immune system

940
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,760
struggles when you don't feel good and

941
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,839
that's What vitamin C really is for you

942
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,839
can be on a ship with beef beef jerky if

943
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:51,680
you're on that ship too long out in Sea

944
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:55,599
you will get scurvy your bones will fall

945
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,440
apart you will get rickets rickets will

946
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,440
eat your bones they will drill through

947
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,800
your bones like rickets

948
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,880
will will burrow through your skin it's

949
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,160
critical to know if you're on a ship

950
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,760
okay I I mean look now that carnivore

951
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,640
dudes on social know that you need to

952
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,560
eat some fruit at least to keep yourself

953
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,200
alive now they know you need a little

954
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,480
lemon and you need some fruit to keep

955
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,880
the themselves can you imagine a whole

956
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,960
bunch of carnivore dudes before they

957
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,000
knew that and they were just packing

958
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,560
beef jerky on their little trip on a

959
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,200
boat and if they were on that boat for a

960
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,880
year can you imagine what they would

961
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,800
look like when they came back riddled in

962
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,400
rickets riddled and scurvy they would be

963
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,680
a mess they wouldn't have a muscle on

964
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,280
them they would just be literally

965
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,680
skeletons of themselves they would be

966
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,119
shadows of themselves that's how

967
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,680
ridiculous that is because there's a

968
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,680
reason why you take a lime tree on a

969
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,480
ship that's going to be out in Sea for a

970
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,119
long time because the lime will save

971
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,119
your life it will save your life the

972
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:14,119
orange will save your

973
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,040
life it just will vitamin C and then you

974
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,880
take like a pure vitamin C like this

975
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,599
like a pure form of vitamin C right here

976
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,520
like the vimergy one which isn't all

977
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:28,079
ascorbic acid it's not ascorbic acid I'm

978
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,599
saying this cuz this is important to

979
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,599
know because people burn holes in their

980
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:36,640
guts with ascorbic acid they get all the

981
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,440
vitamin C packets straight ascorbic acid

982
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,440
they think they're doing their body good

983
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,880
they're pouring that in stuff here let

984
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,040
me just open up another one of these

985
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,640
packets and pour it in here it's

986
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,880
straight ascorbic

987
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:53,079
acid it's too harsh on the stomach

988
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,720
lining too harsh to the gastric glands

989
00:41:53,079 --> 00:42:01,240
too harsh to the dadum to the intestinal

990
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,040
lining too harsh and people just eat up

991
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:07,359
their lining with that ascorbic acid and

992
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:10,079
that's what people do right and then the

993
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,880
viy right here so if you don't know the

994
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,599
stuff V is in viictor i m is a Mary E RG

995
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,720
y.com you can go to vimergy.com

996
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:23,720
vimergy that micro C right there is

997
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,640
buffered truly buffered it's not a scorc

998
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,920
acid and it's buffered so that's a whole

999
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,640
game danger right there I can't talk

1000
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,200
about it enough and I don't talk about

1001
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,640
it enough I should be talking about this

1002
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:37,680
stuff every hour every day because it's

1003
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,520
that important for chronic illness it's

1004
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,400
that important for the immune system

1005
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,319

that I'm going to put a little bit of

1055
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,400
honey in here too remember the glucose

1056
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,880
Honey's got its own

1057
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,079
powers a little bit of honey in

1058
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,319
there okay that's the

1059
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,160
glucose vitamin C shock therapy is

1060
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,960
really incredible because you're you're

1061
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,240
actually bonding that antioxidant into

1062
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,400
the glucose of Honey which already has

1063
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,119
phytochemical compounds which is a

1064
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,440
wonderful thing all on its own let's get

1065
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,839
an orange here okay the Orange is

1066
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:29,280
dropping everywhere

1067
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,520
you can put a whole Orange in there you

1068
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,800
can put a half an orange in there that's

1069
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,800
okay so I'm squeezing right

1070
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,400
now half an orange I'm going to squeeze

1071
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,720
a little bit more this orange here so if

1072
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,400
you guys just came on here this is the

1073
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,280
medical medium vitamin C shock therapy

1074
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,839
man the bugs going around and everything

1075
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,280
else out there and everybody's immune

1076
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,599
system is always under attack fight or

1077
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,359
flight and that's the problem too a lot

1078
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,800
of people's immune system immune systems

1079
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:04,520
are under adrenaline attack from all the

1080
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,920
fight or flight they got stress they got

1081
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,160
all these things going on and that

1082
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,240
stress really affects the immune system

1083
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,240
but people don't know why or how well

1084
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,400
it's affecting it because adrenaline

1085
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:20,520
shocks immune cells adrenaline from

1086
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,240
stress so it hits the immune system so

1087
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,720
I'm going to stir this

1088
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,480
up okay repeat this every two hours

1089
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,079
every two waking

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,559
maybe you got something else going on

1113
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,200
right maybe you just feel like you're

1114
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,359
run down maybe you've been doing a lot

1115
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,040
not sleeping as much not taking care of

1116
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,040
yourself because you can't because

1117
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,240
you're working really hard something I

1118
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,839
am guilty of very very

1119
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,359
guilty I'm guilty of the crime of

1120
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:51,680
working a lot of hours trying to get

1121
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,079
these books done and everything else and

1122
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,280
not getting enough

1123
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,400
sleep so this is something that that is

1124
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,640
is just really powerful that for that

1125
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,280
how is hot water is it hot water it's

1126
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,240
warm water you can do it in hot I like

1127
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,760
warm water for this okay so how hot is

1128
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,559
the water is the question mark on IG I

1129
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,720
just saw it's not that hot watch you

1130
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:16,720
don't even need to blow on

1131
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,520
it little edgy but it's not hot you can

1132
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,000
definitely do that it's like the perfect

1133
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,920
temperature right

1134
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,319
there so that is the medical me and vit

1135
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,200
vitamin C shock

1136
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,800
therapy so sh so I'm going to read a

1137
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,359
little bit of this too you don't want to

1138
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,720
Scorch it you don't want it boiling you

1139
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:37,920
don't want to put boiling water in there

1140
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,559
you

1141
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,880
don't

1142
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,079
so um I'm almost out of this one I've

1143
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,920
really knocked it I've knocked it down

1144
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,559
I'm just saying pretty much there isn't

1145
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,520
much left at the bottom of there Janine

1146
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:56,880
says does the powder have stronger

1147
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:00,079
powers than the micro C tablets you can

1148
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:03,280
do the micro tablets they're also really

1149
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:07,040
powerful too it's okay this one right

1150
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:10,799
here has a little bit added things for

1151
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:15,040
skin keep that in mind right but it's

1152
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:15,040
more convenient that's the key it's more

1153
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,799
convenient I love the the capsules I

1154
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,200
take them all the time I'll take eight

1155
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:25,440
capsules so when I do the vitamin C

1156
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,760
capsules the micro C I'll do like eight

1157
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,760
capsules boom I want to get vitamin C in

1158
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,319
me I do I want my skin looking good I

1159
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,359
don't want my skin to fall apart I don't

1160
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:42,680
want my skin to start getting all like

1161
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:46,559
nasty and stuff I don't and I I want it

1162
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,559
to look good I want it to Glow so yeah I

1163
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,240
take a lot of vitamin C but I don't take

1164
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,200
ascorbic acid I don't take somebody

1165
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,559
else's vitamin C I take the vimergy

1166
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,480
vitamin C for the Vitamin C shock

1167
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,520
therapy powder it's not nice because you

1168
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,559
don't have to open up the capsules it's

1169
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,760
easy you scoop it you put it in you mix

1170
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,040
it up I like it for that reason right

1171
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,319
there but of course you can open up the

1172
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,240
capsules vitam medical me and vitamin C

1173
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,680
shock therapy is set up where you can

1174
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,000
just open up the capsules and put it in

1175
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:16,160
there it says that but I use both I do I

1176
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,640
do I'll do it this way and pop some

1177
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,280
capsules of

1178
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,319
course so why does the medical me

1179
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,559
vitamin C shock therapy bring healing to

1180
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,960
a new

1181
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,280
level because it takes specific kind of

1182
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,720
glucose you'll find mainly in raw

1183
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:36,079
honey so it's not even just you got one

1184
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,920
thing you got the power of the micro se

1185
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,079
but when you put it with honey something

1186
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,760
happens and that was something Spirit of

1187
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,000
compassion taught me all these years so

1188
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,920
it's like well I I need to make sure

1189
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,119
this gets out there and message this

1190
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:54,640
information when you add that raw honey

1191
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:58,119
or a raw honey to that

1192
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:00,760
antioxidant and that buffer antioxidant

1193
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:03,640
what could happen is another

1194
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:07,520
level so and what you do is you freshly

1195
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:10,319
squeeze the vitamin C from an orange in

1196
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:13,359
here too which is another type of

1197
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:15,599
vitamin C from an orange so what you're

1198
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,400
doing is you're doing two kinds of

1199
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,440
vitamin C right there vitamin C from

1200
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,280
Citrus from the orange coupled with the

1201
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,040
micro C from vimergy and you're doing

1202
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,040
that with the glucose from the Raw honey

1203
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,520
and you have

1204
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,480
yourself something that's

1205
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,319
incredible I'm reading right here if you

1206
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,359
guys don't mind

1207
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,400
right you need the right kind of non

1208
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,319
ascorbic acid vitamin C non ascorbic

1209
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,880
acid vitamin C please know

1210
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:50,680
that so important if you guys know all

1211
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,359
this already just hang in there I'm

1212
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,839
going to be going to be doing some other

1213
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:57,000
stuff today so hang in there if you're

1214
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:59,880
an expert at this the medical me

1215
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,359
information but non ascorbic

1216
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,680
acid and to this day you see it every

1217
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:06,359
day out there you see an influence out

1218
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,200
there like I'm taking my vitamin C and

1219
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:11,799
it's just straight of Scorpi acid I'm

1220
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,599
like you're you're lighting your guts on

1221
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:17,040
fire during the medical medium broadcast

1222
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:20,000
channel I will share the recipes there

1223
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,880
after this live on

1224
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,680
IG all

1225
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,119
right so it drives the vitamin C into

1226
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:31,200
the cell so I want to go into that you

1227
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:34,359
need a sugar to drive a nutrient into a

1228
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,880
cell there are billions of dollars of

1229
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:41,040
nutraceutical that were sold through the

1230
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:42,720
last 25 30 years and because people had

1231
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,359
a fear of

1232
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:49,760
fruit none of that stuff got driven into

1233
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:53,960
cells even if those neutraceuticals

1234
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:56,920
worked I take vitamin E I take vitamin A

1235
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,319
I take a probiotic well that's still I

1236
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,440
take well all these nutrients they put

1237
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:02,920
in probiotic now none of them go into

1238
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:07,040
anything I take you know I take this I

1239
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:10,520
take that I take vitamin B I take a b

1240
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,359
complex I take methola right it doesn't

1241
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:16,799
go into the cells it doesn't enter it if

1242
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,640
you're afraid of something that you need

1243
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:22,280
a special glucose one that's really

1244
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,400
bioidentical to our bodies which is like

1245
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,319
a glucose from

1246
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,680
honey so when you do this vitamin C

1247
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:30,680
shock therapy what you're doing is

1248
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,200
you're bringing the vitamin C deeper

1249
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,319
into the cells so when you do this every

1250
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,640
two hours because you think something's

1251
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:39,799
coming on you think something's wrong

1252
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,000
and you're doing this every two hours

1253
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:45,640
you're infusing your cells you're

1254
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,960
entering into those cells non ascorbic

1255
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:52,559
acid vitamin C directly into the cells

1256
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,119
like that you're mainlining it into the

1257
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:58,000
liver and into the liver cells the liver

1258
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,400
has its own immune system

1259
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,680
and so that vitamin C is being driven to

1260
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,680
those immune cells now immune cells feed

1261
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,920
off of vitamin C it is a food for immune

1262
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,319
cells immune cells need the vitamin C

1263
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,559
they utilize they consume and they need

1264
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:16,480
the vitamin C and so when you put it in

1265
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,079
here mix them just like this with the

1266
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,680
raw honey and then you're adding in the

1267
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,240
orange you're mainlining those nutrients

1268
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,680
that vitamin C and in this case a non-

1269
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:32,839
ascorbic acid one directly into your C

1270
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:35,359
that's one of those keys it's a

1271
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:38,640
key to the

1272
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:41,079
engine Fox over there [ __ ] what books

1273
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,640
what book is this please the 1w is

1274
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:47,280
reading from

1275
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,280
protocols brains saer

1276
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:57,640
protocols bugs don't like vitamin C

1277
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:01,160
toxins don't like vitamin C

1278
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:04,880
free radicals don't like vitamin C

1279
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:09,240
people get filled up with free radicals

1280
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,200
free radicals help you oxidize our body

1281
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,119
is

1282
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:17,920
oxidizing vitamin C slows down the

1283
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:20,760
oxidizing process it is an antioxidant

1284
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,119
that slows down the oxidation process of

1285
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:26,000
our cells dying then if everybody has

1286
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,480
all these different toxins in them and

1287
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,839
poison poisons those free radicals

1288
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:35,400
oxidize cells faster vitamin C is doing

1289
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:39,599
a job by stopping those cells from

1290
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,880
oxidizing faster hence saving your

1291
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,799
skin helping to protect your skin

1292
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,280
because your skin is a sign that there's

1293
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:49,720
serious oxidation process going on

1294
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,640
there's all kinds of things going on too

1295
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,359
and you lose that collagen in your skin

1296
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,559
by eating collagen and that's what

1297
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,440
people do they're eating all this

1298
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,760
collagen

1299
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,680
it's really sad out there and I see

1300
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,559
influencers out there too talking like

1301
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,720
you know they're doing raw dairy they're

1302
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:05,440
they're doing raw milk they're doing

1303
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,200
like the raw cheese they're doing

1304
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,280
they're doing their raw dairy products

1305
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,400
and I'm like and they're just like

1306
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,760
talking about collagen and I'm

1307
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,039
like no no you're not going to get any

1308
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,599
collagen from that but you better be

1309
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,599
taking a vitamin C and if you take an

1310
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,160
ascorbic acid vitamin C over time you're

1311
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,039
just going to start giving your

1312
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,480
intestine and your lining to your

1313
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,680
stomach and dadum with lash when you

1314
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,720
give it Whiplash it starts to get

1315
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,720
sensitive so what happens with the

1316
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,720
scorpicol acid it can up that game for

1317
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,839
those sensitivities because that scorc

1318
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,720
acid is so acidic it's like battery

1319
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:55,440
acid on the intestinal track it's

1320
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,319
battery acid on the Linings it's battery

1321
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,680
acid on the dadum the stomach lining the

1322
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:03,880
esophagus escorp acid becomes like

1323
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,920
battery acid on the

1324
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,559
esophagus and so they're doing all this

1325
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,960
ascorbic acid every day and they think

1326
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:10,400
they're doing their body good when

1327
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,680
they're putting practically what feels

1328
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,799
like battery acid on their Linings and

1329
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:19,920
then their nerves are on those Linings

1330
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:21,039
inside those Linings their vagus nerves

1331
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,440
are

1332
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:27,359
inside those Linings and once those

1333
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:30,240
Vegas nerves the bell rings too much the

1334
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,760
bell rings once once the bell rings too

1335
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,400
much with those Vegas

1336
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,880
nerves then boom I don't know what I'm

1337
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,799
sensitive to I don't know what food I'm

1338

are like eating ve now the only thing

1387
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:39,480
they're eating is

1388
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,559
VE you're allergic to this fish but you

00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,640
can have this fish it's the stupidest

1390
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:45,559
thing I've ever seen and it always has

1391
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,640
been the stupidest thing I've ever seen

1392
00:59:45,559 --> 00:59:53,160
and it's another musical cheer game

1393
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:57,280
right musical chair game yeah the

1394
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,280
allergy test right Tara

1395
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:02,319
terat over there in IG I think so it's

1396
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,359
crazy how it works and that's what

1397
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,920
people go through and the same thing

1398
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:11,760
back to scorc acid it lights the nerves

1399
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:15,440
on fire over time people get hypers

1400
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:18,319
sensitive it becomes an acidy burning

1401
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,359
mechanism that makes nerve sensitive so

1402
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:23,039
when you're doing ascorbic acid this is

1403
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:25,280
not ascorbic acid it's non ascorbic when

1404
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,720
you're doing ascorbic acid your Vegas

1405
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,559
nerves get hypers

1406
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:34,280
sensitive they can because the Linings

1407
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,640
of your intestine the lining of your

1408
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:40,480
dadum your

1409
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:44,319
stomach gets lit up from what feels like

1410
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,319
that battery acid

1411
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,960
so different because I can say that 20

1412
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,839
times and somebody will still just go

1413
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,599
and like get a vitamin C out there and

1414
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:06,799
they don't know it it's like

1415
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:09,200
huh and you know what's a trick out

1416
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:12,079
there now too there's some ascorbic acid

1417
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,559
vitamin C's that say buffer it's a

1418
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,359
Scorpi acid but it's buffered so they

1419
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,280
try to throw something in there to mix

1420
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:21,880
with these Scorpi acid to buffer it it's

1421
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:26,599
still the same it's a Scorpi acid it's

1422
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:29,039
still going to be a fire pit in the gut

1423
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:31,720
and that is not a scor Bic so medical

1424
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,319
medium vitamin C shock

1425
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:36,839
therapy right here there's a couple of

1426
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,520
little pieces of orange in

1427
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:43,240
there that's so good put the raw honey

1428
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,319
in there now remember every two hours

1429
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,520
every two waking hours if you think

1430
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:48,000
something's going on you think

1431
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,559
something's wrong and if you don't have

1432
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
anything going

1433
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:56,480
on what you do is you do one of these a

1434
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,680
day or two of these a day

1435
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,520
but ask your doctor what's right for you

1436
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,640
that's what I would do take the book to

1437
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,760
the doctor ask your doctor can I do the

1438
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,799
medical Bei and vitamin C shock therapy

1439
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:11,599
see what your doctor says that's

1440
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:15,440
all and do what your doctor tells you

1441
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,680
all right if you

1442
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,240
want all right so that's that let's go

1443
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,119
into um let's do the nerve gut acid

1444
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,520

worse it's why people can't exercise

1616
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,679

cleaning out and killing what's

how you k your Vegas nerves Vegas nerve

1646
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,560
exercises do not work if you're getting

1647
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,080
improvements then you never had a Vegas

1648
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:06,280
nerve problem you had some other problem

1649
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:08,280
where exercise is helping you if you're

1650
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,320
if you're improving from somebody's

1651
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,520
Vagas nerve exercise that means whatever

1652
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,640
exercise you're

1653
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:18,280
doing is good for you in other ways

1654
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,840
improving other problems that aren't

1655
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,880
Vegas nerve related because when you

1656
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,640
have true Vegas nerve problems you can't

1657
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,600
play with them you can't toy with them

1658
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:29,400
you can't mess with them they will get

1659
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,480
worse aggravated they will light on fire

1660
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:33,000
and your butt is going to be in trouble

1661
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,600
and that's what happens every day out

1662
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,360
there it's why somebody with chronic

1663
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,120
fatigue syndrome and neurological

1664
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,360
fatigue who's got all kinds of different

1665
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:43,040
body symptoms starts doing something

1666
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:45,000
like Vegas nerve exercises they end up

1667
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,480
seizuring practically they end up

1668
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,920
shutting down totally tired and have to

1669
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,360
lay down there's a reason and another

1670
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,000
thing too there's a reason why they

1671
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:55,360
can't exercise do you you don't think

1672
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,400
that the chronic leil wouldn't go go

1673
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,719
into a gym and exercise 4 hours a

1674
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,199
day like people who haven't experienced

1675
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,239
a health problem yet and they're 22

1676
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:06,840
years old you don't think a 40-year-old

1677
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,440

1678
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,560

40-year-old doesn't want to get into the

1681
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,719

2

1957
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:08,320

just did four shots of the nerve gut

1960
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:16,239
acid

1961
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:18,560
stabilizer use it if you have body odor

1962
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:21,400
and you're confused by it more

1963
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:25,280
noticeably than other situations where

1964
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:27,440
you actually notice it body odor

1965
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,480
if you're dealing with chronic nausea or

1966
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:32,639
chronic bloating use the nerve gut acid

1967
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,800
stabilizer if you're trying to repair

1968
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:39,119
acidic body systems and you want to make

1969
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:41,159
your body systems more alkaline uh-huh

1970
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,719
uh-huh

1971
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:45,560
uh-huh what's the difference between

1972
01:26:43,719 --> 01:26:48,760
I'll give you a quiz what's the

1973
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:52,600
difference between am I getting drunk on

1974
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,600
these what's the difference

1975
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,080
between this right here here the nerve

1976
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:59,320
gut acid stabilizer for getting you

1977
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:02,440
alkaline or alkaline ionizer water

1978
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:04,159
machines the difference is the alkaline

1979
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:06,880
ionizer water machines I don't care what

1980
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:09,600
brand it is leeches

1981
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,400
Metals uh-huh uh-huh that's right

1982
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,119
because the plates that have electricity

1983
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:16,600
to them end up corroding over time you

1984
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:19,440
don't see it at first but it's corroding

1985
