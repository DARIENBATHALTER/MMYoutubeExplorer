1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,720
how many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health chances are whether

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,480
they show it or not most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:17,560
in your life do and chances are you're

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,400
one of them whether you're dealing with

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:25,880
anxiety depression endometriosis acne

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,200
fatigue or any other symptom or

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,520
condition you're far from from

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,640
alone living with symptoms has become

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:41,719
The New Normal so no more guessing games

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,160
it's time to get answers welcome to the

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,160
medical medium podcast I'm Anthony

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,760
William hey everybody we're talking

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,640
about eggs and why eaters lose all and

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,239
don't win anything I got nothing against

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,799
eggs that's not what it is I'm just the

18
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,680
messenger of something no one wants to

19
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:11,040
believe the truth on how eggs were

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,400
weaponized and used against us and when

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,920
you hear how you will never look at eggs

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,479
the same

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,720
again the one question all these years

24
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,000
everyone who knows me personally has

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,680
asked me is what do I know and how much

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,920
do I know give me the SK scary stuff aw

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,920
so you guys are my friends I'm going to

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,680
fill you in on what I know on what

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,399
Spirit of compassion told me many years

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,280
ago when I was younger about guess what

31
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,280
eggs like so many secrets of the health

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,960
industry you won't find this information

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,640
out there anywhere else so let me take

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,840
you back to the 1920s to when pathology

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,079
was expanding the search for what causes

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,119
disease truly began and even though

37
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,600
medicine was in its infancy there was a

38
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,920
private group in the pharmaceutical and

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,080
medical world that no one was aware of

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,760
it involved investors and interests and

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,239
a think tank and they were focused on

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,720
something that would lead us to how sick

43
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,360
we are

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,280
today and why we are getting sicker than

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,239
ever before this mysterious group of

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,959
people were learning about bugs not the

47
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,480
ones that fly around

48
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,280
like and you know and other little

49
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,000
insect sounds and everything else not

50
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,640
the mosquitoes not those kind of bugs

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,080
they were focused on other bugs

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,440
pathogens and realizing how dangerous

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,440
they can be catching them harboring them

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,239
holding them hostage these little

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,440
pathogens and what pathogens am I

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,920
talking about virus uses and

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,760
bacteria and they're realizing that they

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,720
may be able to use these bugs but in

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,400
order to make more pathogens more bugs

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,799
cuz how can you use them if you can't

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,840
keep on recreating them the Private

62
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,080
Industry needed to figure out how to

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
grow them it's like anything you grow

64
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
it's like if you want to grow something

65
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,799
you just got to learn how to grow it

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
right you want to grow a garden you want

67
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,959
grow some tomato plants you want to grow

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
more Tomatoes got to figure out how to

69
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:41,200
do it well they had to figure out how to

70
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,720
farm these bugs so it was bug farming

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,599
and even then they knew viruses and

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,400
bacteria needed something to sustain

73
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,920
itself needed a food you know how like

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,799
you're hungry are you hungry right now

75
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,920
and we need food to sustain ourselves

76
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:04,519
well they knew something with these bugs

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,959
that they needed something like we

78
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,879
needed something cuz they were like well

79
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,079
bugs need something well we need

80
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,239
something everybody needs something the

81
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,880
Private Industry also knew that all

82
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,919
viruses and bacteria were alive The

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Details Matter here the Private Industry

84
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,840
knew viruses and bacteria were alive not

85
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,120
the public one because everybody has

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:37,240
been told all these years and now the

87
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:41,039
viruses are not really alive and all

88
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,199
viruses and bacteria don't eat food they

89
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,240
just don't eat that's what we're told

90
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,280
too all these years like why would a

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,039
virus or bacteria actually eat

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,160
like like why would it eat and spirit of

93
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,919
compassion has been the only source

94
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,080
saying for decades now that bugs eat to

95
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,039
stay alive

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,080
because the truth is the Private

97
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,360
Industry has always known this you have

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,720
to understand something everything you

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,479
know about science and research in

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,600
health is controlled or they only let

101
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,840
certain information out of the gate

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,560
there's so much classified classified

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,560
research and science see the difference

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,960
all the medical information and research

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,120
and Science in the health industry both

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,080
conventional and Alterna ative even

107
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:38,360
today is controlled and someone doesn't

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,000
want you to know that bugs like viruses

109
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,800
and bacteria eat food to stay alive

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
because someone's going to get in

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,360
trouble down the road if that just keeps

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,840
on going and going yes they are alive

113
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,360
and yes they eat so the industry needed

114
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,160
to find a food like we need a food how

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,160
are we going to keep these bugs alive

116
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
what are we going to do they need a fuel

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,960
source something that bugs would feed on

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,520
pathogens would feed on the goal was to

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,560
keep bugs alive outside of the human

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,639
body and allow them to grow in the lab

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,479
Farm them you know like farm- raised

122
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,840
fish you got them wild in the ocean you

123
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,880
know like wild caught fish wild fish

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,960
right and you got them wild in the

125
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,720
streams but they Farm the fish so they

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,479
Farm the salmon you know how do you farm

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
them and keep them growing and then just

128
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,759
feed them and find a food they like well

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,680
the industry needed a perfect

130
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:39,520
environment and tried everything they

131
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,199
tried sugar to feed bugs and pathogens

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,199
and guess what it didn't work because

133
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,080
viruses and bacteria don't eat sugar

134
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:53,280
they found sugar did the opposite how

135
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,599
weird is that Sugar inhibited the growth

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,160
of these pathogens they couldn't go

137
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,039
anywhere or develop or proliferate with

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,360
sugar so then the industry tried various

139
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,360
animal products they tried meat think

140
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,080
about that one for a second did that

141
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,479
work see that wasn't the winning ticket

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,240
either it didn't work animal meat would

143
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,800
not feed the bugs cuz I'm sure some of

144
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,000
you plant basers out there like yeah

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,840
that's what's doing it probably that's

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,280
what's doing it you know they

147
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,840
systematically went through every food

148
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:31,240
and stumbl across just one how weird is

149
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,599
this just one what they learned was that

150
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,960
when they examined an egg a fresh egg

151
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:41,319
they noticed that on the outside of the

152
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,840
shell bacteria was capable of living the

153
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,400
bacteria could live and survive on the

154
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,360
outside of an egg you ever hear of like

155
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,680
salmonella being on like the outside of

156
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,039
eggs you know over the years like whoa

157
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,560
there's a recall from 10 Farms out there

158
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,960
and we need all the eggs all destroyed

159
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
that are in the grocery stores because

160
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,240
there's a salmonella outbreak break and

161
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,599
it's on the eggs it's on the eggshells

162
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,800
like well why is the salmonella still

163
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,840
alive why is it still alive the eggs

164
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,080
well it's been days and days and days

165
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,440
later they've been packed they've been

166
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,199
shipped they've been on trucks tractor

167
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,080
trailers they've been on highways for

168
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,400
three straight days then they get into a

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,159
store they're not even packed out yet

170
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,120
they're sitting in the back of the the

171
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,919
you know the refrigerator section of the

172
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,360
grocery store and then a produce manager

173
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,800
or a dairy manager comes out he like

174
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,680
okay let's get these eggs on the Shelf

175
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,959
this is like 10 days later how is

176
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:40,320
Salmonella capable of living on that egg

177
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,039
all this time later but check this out

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,680
okay I talked to an egg farmer and he

179
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,920
said well the process is kind of like

180
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,080
this Anthony you got to collect the eggs

181
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,279
they got to go in the cartons they got

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,079
to get on a truck they got to be at a

183
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,399
waiting area a transition place a

184
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,200
station then they're back on another

185
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,480
truck then they're driving across the

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,399
country then they get to the store and

187
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,079
now they're in the cold section of the

188
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,680
store in the back in the warehouse of

189
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,200
the store and then all the Egg Farmers

190
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,680
have to call all the stores and yell at

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
them and say can you hurry up and get

192
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,079
the eggs on the shelf and then all the

193
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,160
stores say we haven't sold our other

194
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,040
eggs yet and it's still in the shelf

195
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,959
life date the freshness date is still

196
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,920
good and we want to sell those out

197
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,279
and the Farms are like wait a minute

198
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,399
here just hurry up and get them out and

199
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,560
so now it's another week in the back of

200
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,560
the store and then finally when they

201
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,480
sell all the eggs they get the other

202
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,040
eggs out they put them on the Shelf

203
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,160
we're talking two weeks sometimes we're

204
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,519
talking three weeks so Egg Farmers they

205
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,399
actually have to put a longer shelf life

206
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,399
date on the carton and then here's the

207
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,200
funny part then you go to the

208
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,600
store oo I like these eggs oh I like

209
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,560
these eggs too let me get those okay I'm

210
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,320
at the checkout I'm getting my eggs let

211
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,920
me go home putting them in the fridge

212
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,399
they're nice and fresh there's a good

213
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,040
date on them but you don't eat them that

214
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,839
day not all of them sometimes people

215
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,120
leave eggs in the fridge they're like

216
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,040
there in the fridge for like a week

217
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,079
that's another week and maybe even more

218
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,160
and guess what when there's a salmonella

219
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,959
breakout they're like throw out your

220
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,079
eggs everybody throw out your eggs

221
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,680
meanwhile those eggs are already a month

222
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:33,399
away from when they were hatched I mean

223
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,200
laid you guys know what I mean so now

224
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:39,320
before this discovery that bacteria can

225
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,880
stay alive on the outside of an egg they

226
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,120
kept bugs alive in human blood now this

227
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Private Industry many many years ago

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,000
they tried animal blood and noticed

229
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,000
pathogens bugs could not live or Thrive

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,120
longterm viruses and bacteria they

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,880
couldn't proliferate or colonize in

232
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,839
animal blood easy now remember animal

233
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,519
blood on its own I'm talking about human

234
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,160
blood on its own not inside the host

235
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,240
they found human blood was the only

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:19,680
blood that would sustain these bugs and

237
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,200
keep the pathogens alive enough so they

238
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,800
kept these early pathogens alive using

239
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,720
human blood keeping the temperature

240
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
adequate so it's like let's get a

241
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
patient in here let's steal some blood

242
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,279
let's keep that blood in the

243
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,959
refrigerator let's make sure we take

244
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,600
some out then let's keep the temperature

245
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,800
adequate let's keep the bugs in there

246
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,000
let's see how long they can live let's

247
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,800
let's analyze them let's see if we can

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,959
keep them growing enough to stay alive

249
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,519
but they won't proliferate and they were

250
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,279
in this Jam like how are we going to

251
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,639
farm this stuff like how are we going to

252
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,240
make these pathogens live longer and

253
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,160
isn't that funny because shouldn't you

254
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,000
want pathogen not to live like hm we got

255
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,600
a plague right now right do we want that

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,680
virus that's going around right now

257
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,079
scaring everybody do we want it to live

258
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,240
like do we want all these bugs to live

259
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,920
well that's the deal this private

260
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,120
industry was about growing and farming

261
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,160
bugs and it's going to take us to some

262
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,680
other talk later but because they

263
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,760
realize humans had a percentage of

264
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,800
something inside their blood already

265
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,120
that was keeping these bugs at least in

266
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,079
a

267
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,959
hypnotic state so what was that a

268
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:43,040
percentage of mercury people patients

269
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,199
had a percentage of mercury inside their

270
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,360
blood and that mercury was keeping the

271
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,079
bugs in this hypnotic living state so

272
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,639
they can analyze them study them try to

273
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:02,360
keep them alive preserve them sustain

274
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,079
them them Mercury was used in almost

275
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:08,160
every aspect of medicine back in the

276
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:11,560
1920s and a little bit before that too

277
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,839
they wanted more they wanted more bugs

278
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,760
they needed them to thrive they needed

279
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,839
them to grow and colonize and Mercury

280
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,240
was preserving them and keeping them

281
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,760
alive and sustaining them in that

282
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,040
hypnotic State and even partially

283
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,160
feeding them but it wasn't enough and

284
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,360
they didn't know how like how can we

285
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:41,839
grow more bugs until one patient's blood

286
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:46,639
not only kept the bugs alive it exploded

287
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,639
them it exploded them they noticed quick

288
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,000
colonizations they were able to watch

289
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,040
viruses reproduce

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,759
rapidly they were able to analyze

291
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,880
pathogens recreating themselves in large

292
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,399
numbers oh my God it was that kind of

293
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,160
moment they're like what was in this

294
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,880
person's blood what was in it that did

295
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,480
this so they analyzed what the patient

296
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,959
was eating so sir um we got to talk to

297
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
you about what you were eating and what

298
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:18,639
you're eating and stuff why well we just

299
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,240
need that information we need to know

300
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,519
well okay here's my diet I eat eggs in

301
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,399
the morning and um I eat eggs for lunch

302
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,279
in the

303
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,839
afternoon and I eat eggs for dinner

304
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,519
and before I go to bed I eat another

305
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,480
egg and they noticed that this patient

306
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:42,639
their diet was

307
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,759
95% eggs and this patient had a lot of

308
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,040
their own Chicken cops so a lot of

309
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,839
Chicken Shacks on their property and

310
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,440
they ate eggs and this is right around

311
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,199
the 1920s early 1920s so they were like

312
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,240
wait a minute here so they noticed when

313
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,360
another other patients blood wasn't

314
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:08,480
allowing pathogens to survive at all

315
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,639
their diet comprised of no eggs so now

316
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,279
they're like okay we got something here

317
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,560
this patient eats no eggs their blood

318
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,000
isn't helping at all like the pathogens

319
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,600
are just staying hypnotic with the

320
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
Mercury for a little while inside the

321
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,480
blood but then they just die off

322
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,759
eventually but this guy's blood is

323
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,959
allowing pathogens to thrive right in

324
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,480
front of them as if it was a magical

325
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:37,319
magical experience like a miracle was

326
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,519
happening and that's what they noticed

327
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:44,639
so but there was the potential for mild

328
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:46,440
growth if someone ate some eggs so then

329
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,360
they brought people in were like listen

330
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:53,279
we want you to eat eggs for breakfast

331
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,319
only every day s days a week and let's

332
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,839
take your blood so then they take their

333
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:59,759
blood and they noticed the pathogens

334
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,639
were alive and doing a little bit better

335
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
and even growing a little bit so then

336
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,319
they would tell a patient well we want

337
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,839
you to eat eggs for morning and eggs for

338
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,079
afternoon but don't eat them for dinner

339
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,319
and they took blood and they noticed the

340
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:15,839
pathogens were colonizing even more and

341
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:18,199
then they went back to that other guy

342
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
and they said we need some more blood

343
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:23,560
and that guy was like sure and they

344
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,120
noticed oh my God this is exploding so

345
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,600
then they requested all their patients

346
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,160
to be eating eggs three times a day and

347
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
they were even more than that they'd say

348
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,079
eat them as much as you like can you

349
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,399
imagine some patients were like I'm

350
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,120
getting sick of eggs here I'm getting

351
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,000
sick of eggs right here they said well

352
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,800
you can eat some other things in between

353
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,680
you could still eat some other foods but

354
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,839
eat eggs three times a day and the goal

355
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:55,800
was two eggs three times a day that was

356
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,680
the amount they wanted now this is

357
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,000
interesting because a lot of people they

358
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,600
would eat two eggs three times a day but

359
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,280
some people would eat less eggs some

360
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,480
people would eat a little more but what

361
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,319
they noticed out of everything that no

362
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,720
matter what if eggs were a big part of

363
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,559
the person's diet the bugs would grow

364
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,559
quicker no matter what so this led to

365
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:24,480
the discovery of a food that was going

366
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,720
to change history in chronic illness

367
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,039
you're probably thinking wait in a good

368
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,880
way or a bad way well let's just say

369
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,840
hang in there cuz you're going to know

370
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,320
we're going to talk about it instead of

371
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,600
using a patient's blood they went for

372
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,720
the egg itself and that's when they

373
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,320
realized that when they took a virus or

374
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:52,000
bacteria that was in a patient's blood

375
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:55,960
and now placed it on the outside of an

376
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,679
eggshell the virus and bacteria was able

377
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,240
to survive they started connect Con in

378
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,000
the dots so what's the next phase what

379
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,559
is it it was to cut the top of the egg

380
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,039
off the

381
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,679
eggshell and cut the top of an eggshell

382
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,000
that was fresh from a fresh egg keep the

383
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,400
temperature of the egg at the right

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,480
level and then insert the bacteria and

385
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:27,320
viruses into the egg and of course add a

386
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:31,039
little nutmeg and cinnamon actually

387
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,799
no add a tiny bit of mercury what else

388
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,120
would the medical industry be adding and

389
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,240
that's what they did they put a little

390
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,720
bit of mercury inside the egg with the

391
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,080
virus and bacteria it's a brilliant

392
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,799
brilliant Discovery and and scheme and

393
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,960
then what would happen they reproduced

394
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:55,080
and colonized rapidly viruses bacteria

395
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,880
the farm raising happened boom they got

396
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,080
it does this remind you guys of

397
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,799
something why are we told to not leave

398
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,480
that egg salad with the Mayo

399
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,559
unrefrigerated in the sun too long at a

400
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,679
picnic or a party right like why are we

401
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:15,200
told well because bacteria will find it

402
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,679
and colonized on the eggs and in the

403
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,080
Mayo which contains eggs in the egg

404
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:24,320
salad and then food poisoning commences

405
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:28,480
here we come so let me spell this out

406
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:33,080
for you the classified industry took

407
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:37,360
your favorite food used it in labs to

408
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,559
breed viruses and bacteria farming Farm

409
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,000
raising them creating many different

410
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:48,480
strains and mutations that weren't out

411
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,400
yet in human nature and somehow somehow

412
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,440
these pathogens got out of the labs and

413
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,760
into people I don't know how that

414
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,080
happened um that they just walked out of

415
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,320
the lab you know the virus is just got

416
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,120
off the they got out of the pre petri

417
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,880
dish they got out of the egg they

418
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,320
crawled out and they just walked drawn

419
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,159
out hey I'm putting on my shoes got my

420
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,120
coat got my umbrella we're all heading

421
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,559
out of the

422
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:17,799
labs yeah how do they get out okay and

423
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,880
this led to the early explosion of

424
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:23,559
chronic illness in the 1940s and 1950s

425
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,679
when women were filing in to their

426
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,760
doctor's offices with symptoms never

427
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,960
seen before in our history by 1950 this

428
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,440
was happening what does this have to do

429
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,640
with you who cares this is boring who

430
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,520
cares it's why you're sick now you got a

431
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,760
symptom it's why you're sick now you got

432
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,640
eczema it's why you're sick what does

433
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,679
this have to do with your acne a lot

434
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
that miserable acne that people have

435
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,880
where they're so upset and they're so I

436
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,760
mean traumatized by it and it can really

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,320
affect somebody's life on a deep level

438
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:06,360
emotionally mentally physically and that

439
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:10,320
acne wouldn't be there if it wasn't for

440
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:13,400
this this is why you have struggled with

441
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,559
acne this is the classified private

442
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,279
industry's fault going all the way back

443
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,440
it's why you're suffering today it's why

444
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,760
your bloating is happening because of

445
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,760
this it's why your endometriosis is

446
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,440
happening your body pain your fatigue

447
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,760
and every other condition you can think

448
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,880
of everything now hm get ready for this

449
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:43,120
one the industry wanted us sick the bugs

450
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:47,600
just didn't walk on out no they needed

451
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:51,679
us sick it was important they created

452
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,480
illnesses by using bugs now the public

453
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,080
industry public medical industry public

454
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,559
research and science public industries

455
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,640
of all

456
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,760
they don't know this people work for

457
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,799
them everything's happy good you go to

458
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,279
the office whatever you go to the lab

459
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,559
they don't know this is going on they

460
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:09,760
didn't know that this is where it

461
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:11,760
started this is the classified stuff

462
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,279
going all the way back you're not

463
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:19,480
supposed to know this so that's what fed

464
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:22,279
the industry it kept them fat and happy

465
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,320
people being sick was the bread and

466
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,600
butter and bacon and we were fried in a

467
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,600
pan and our favorite food the egg

468
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,880
an old survival food that helped Keep Us

469
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:40,039
Alive during hard times was used against

470
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,200
us was used against you was used against

471
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:47,159
your children was used against everybody

472
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,760
you know and it's still being used

473
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:54,360
against us unknowingly today we eat the

474
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:58,200
egg we feed our bugs we eventually get

475
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,279
sick if we collect more bugs we feed

476
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,640
those bugs and we get sicker the

477
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:09,279
industry keeps on raising bugs new ones

478
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:14,960
and old ones they catalog them secretly

479
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:18,520
classifying them they categorize them

480
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,400
in different strains different

481
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,240
categories different

482
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,840
mutations and then they feed them eggs

483
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,000
while they're doing it they feed them

484
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,039
eggs while they're doing it and then

485
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,919
they let them out of the game

486
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:36,480
meaning they release them to the public

487
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:39,320
mhm they do and we get more bugs because

488
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,400
of it and then we eat eggs and we keep

489
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,200
the bugs alive and then we get

490
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,799
sicker and if you are lucky and you're

491
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,159
someone with very few bugs or not the

492
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,520
aggressive strains or aggressive

493
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,039
mutations you can eat a lot of eggs and

494
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,279
get away with it for quite a while

495
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,080
especially if you're eating other good

496
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,559
foods or taking care of yourself you can

497
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,120
kind of keep that balance but if you're

498
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:09,080
somebody with lime disease neurological

499
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,279
lime brain fog Hashimoto thyroiditis

500
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,520
rheumatoid arthritis do you have that

501
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:20,760
eczema psoriasis endometriosis fibroids

502
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,120
cysts lupus Ms ey floaters are you

503
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,520
somebody with eye floaters so many

504
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:27,200
people have so many different kinds of

505
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,760
ey floaters right eczema psoriasis I

506
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,520
said that before Vitiligo depression

507
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,919
crippling anxiety so many people are

508
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,720
suffering from just debilitating anxiety

509
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,480
body pain neck pain back pain

510
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,760
fibromyalgia burning skin Tinkles and

511
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,760
numbness hives how many people have

512
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,720
hives out there mystery rashes

513
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:55,399
dermatitis Scleroderma rosacea Crohn's

514
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,960
citis cold sores yeah cold sores

515
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,159
H guess where those cold sores came from

516
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,880
from they were raised in eggs going all

517
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,360
the way back a 100 years and they were

518
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,880
let out of the gate so your misery with

519
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,159
cold sores which is herpes simplex one

520
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,960
lives on and lives on and then we pass

521
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,320
it on to somebody else and it lives on

522
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,960
they did this and they used the egg to

523
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,000
do it it was the only way it could be

524
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,440
done and then there's sibo and Celiac

525
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,039
migraines or any autoimmune condition

526
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,240
you want to avoid eggs if you have any

527
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,080
of these symptoms or conditions you

528
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,480
might be saying to yourself I don't eat

529
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,120
eggs or I don't eat many of them first

530
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,720
of all you probably eat more eggs than

531
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,440
you realize throughout your life did you

532
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,080
ever eat mayonnaise or thousand island

533
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,159
dressing or animal style fries or animal

534
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,640
style Burgers pastries cakes cookies

535
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:00,240
donuts many different breads or rolls

536
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,360
did you ever eat pasta and pizza crust

537
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,919
did you ever have cookie dough there are

538
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,360
so many foods that have egg in it and

539
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,039
you might be someone that's like well I

540
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,559
haven't had a food with egg in it in a

541
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:14,840
long time but it sits inside the liver

542
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:18,960
for a lifetime residue unless you

543
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,520
cleanse it out and if you got bugs it'll

544
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,640
feed off that residue and the bugs will

545
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,360
have a field day so enough anyway to

546
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,240
feed these symptoms and conditions even

547
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,640
when you're off eggs for a while let's

548
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,120
talk about this what the industry did by

549
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,480
raising pathogens on your favorite food

550
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,679
so that when you eat an egg and

551
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,520
gradually worsen your condition without

552
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,440
realizing it is

553
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,399
Despicable and it happens to everybody

554
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,760
and you eventually get something no

555
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,919
matter what everybody gets something

556
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,279
thyroid symptoms at age 40 migraines

557
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:03,679
headaches weight gain it the list goes

558
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,559
on and fatigue hot flashes body pain

559
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,279
eczema or other skin conditions like I

560
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:13,520
said acne now why would eggs play a role

561
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:16,919
because these conditions are caused by

562
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,880
viruses like Epstein bar and shingles

563
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,320
it's medical medium information that I

564
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,279
brought out there all through these

565
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,840
years and doctors are learning about it

566
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,960
every day and they're helping their

567
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,760
patients so herpes simplex which is cold

568
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,559
sorce the fever blister okay herpes

569
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:38,480
simplex 1 2 hhv6

570
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,200
hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 through 16

571
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,760
right Epstein bar and over 60 varieties

572
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,120
of Epstein bar and mutations shingles

573
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,360
over 30 varieties of shingles and

574
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,000
mutations strepto coctus bacteria which

575
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,799
has hundreds of strains undiscovered and

576
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,720
over 50 different groups that's

577
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,519
undiscovered that were raised in the

578
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,840
labs by by the industry so what's in an

579
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:07,000
egg that these bugs like to eat let's go

580
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:10,360
there next all right protein and enzymes

581
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,159
but hey Protein that's why you're eating

582
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:15,880
eggs yay that's the whole point and

583
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:19,320
enzymes can't be bad right the protein

584
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:22,399
in an egg is attached to enzymes that

585
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,159
viruses can easily absorb through their

586
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:27,880
membrane because the proteins are not

587
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,279
mature they are in their development

588
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,320
phase so the enzymes are attached to the

589
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,679
protein a unique process that only

590
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,880
happens in an egg there are a large

591
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
amount of enzymes in a chicken egg

592
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,320
because the chick has not formed yet so

593
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,760
the proteins are unstable and the

594
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,840
enzymes help keep the protein stabilized

595
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,240
also the bugs feed off of hormones

596
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,039
natural occurring hormones in the egg

597
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,279
itself so if you're thinking hey wait a

598
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:02,840
minute I'm safe I I could do my organic

599
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:05,760
egg or I can do my backyard raised eggs

600
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,519
but no the egg is a unique ball of

601
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,080
hormones all eggs even organic eggs are

602
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,960
so H what happens when you eat an egg

603
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,519
let's go into that next how is it going

604
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,600
to feed a virus like how's that even

605
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,320
going to happen or a bacteria inside of

606
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,440
you you chew the

607
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:26,240
egg Yum Yum Yum you swallow it it enters

608
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:30,919
your small intestinal tract if there's

609
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,120
some hpy l in there right that HP Lori

610
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,600
is going to have a field day it's going

611
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,600
to have a picnic it's going to have a

612
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,440
nice brunch if there's some strep to

613
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,240
coctus in there you're thinking I don't

614
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,720
have strep wa what's he even talking

615
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,440
about this is ridiculous uh sibo H

616
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,720
that's strepto coctus um UTI bladder

617
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,880
infections yeast infections kidney

618
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:56,600
infections chronic sinusitus um sty

619
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,360
let's see the list goes on yeah people

620
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,000
have strup tock this all in their system

621
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,679
did you have strep throat a long time

622
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,039
ago because it's still in us if you have

623
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,600
a little bit of strep in your gut

624
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,480
because everybody does you can be

625
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,720
somebody with a small amount of bugs so

626
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,880
it's a small Feeding Frenzy that goes on

627
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,360
inside your gut and or inside your liver

628
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,279
or inside your bloodstream or anywhere

629
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,600
else eventually when the egg travels but

630
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,919
you can be somebody though with a large

631
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,840
Feeding Frenzy going on inside of you

632
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,480
and you have a lot of symptoms and

633
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,559
there's a lot going on with your health

634
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,480
and the bugs get little bits of the egg

635
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,640
the bacteria absorbs the egg through its

636
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,000
membrane the outer membrane that

637
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,640
protects the

638
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,640
bacteria over time you start getting

639
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,200
some bloating or digestive issues down

640
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,399
the road and you land yourself a sibo

641
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,960
diagnosis which most women are getting

642
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,320
at this point in time and a lot of men a

643
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,159
lot of men are getting that sibo

644
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,519
diagnosis as the egg travels through

645
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,880
your intestinal tract the egg is pretty

646
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:09,240
much like a gluey Goo now it's being

647
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,559
absorbed through the intestinal tract up

648
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,279
into the hepatic portal vein heading to

649
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,480
the liver so now the eggs traveling up

650
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:22,200
to the liver inside everyone's liver are

651
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,760
where most of the bugs are at plus

652
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,960
toxins

653
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,240
petrochemicals pesticides herbicides

654
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,919
fungicides toxic Metals Mercury lead

655
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,760
aluminum cadmium copper just list goes

656
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,679
on the list goes on okay but there's

657
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,200
bugs in there cuz bugs like being in

658
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,480
there too cuz remember what I was

659
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,200
telling you before Mercury feeds bugs

660
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,880
just enough well the Private Industry

661
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,320
the classified part figured that out

662
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,120
long ago so our liver has that too in

663
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,960
there so bugs like the bee in there they

664
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,840
love that spot but that spot egg gets in

665
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,159
there there too and that's where it's

666
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,240
like more fun the eggs coming up into

667
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:07,159
the liver here it comes and some people

668
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,440
have more eggs going on inside the liver

669
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:11,840
building up some people have more things

670
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,840
in the liver but here's the thing some

671
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,360
people have more bugs inside their liver

672
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,559
that's where it gets a little sketchy

673
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,600
like one Epstein bar two Epstein bar

674
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,679
three Epstein bar like one potato two

675
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,080
potato three potato they'll have all

676
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,600
kinds of different bugs in there they'll

677
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,399
have a Simplex in there if they've ever

678
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,960
had a cold s in their life well that

679
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,279
Simplex lives in the liver if they ever

680
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,720
haded shingles or maybe they have

681
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,000
shingles and don't know it because they

682
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,440
have back pain or jaw pain trigeminal

683
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,480
neuralgia or anything else going on but

684
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,399
the point is these bugs are in the liver

685
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,399
and that's where the party happens

686
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,480
that's the camp out that's the

687
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,880
campground that's the fair that's the

688
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,519
county fair it's happening in the liver

689
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,159
with all these bugs somebody will have a

690
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,279
couple different varieties of bugs

691
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:01,200
couple other different varieties of bugs

692
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,039
and some people just might have one or

693
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,600
two and they haven't really done much

694
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,519
yet but as the immune system drops over

695
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,840
time you're under stress your

696
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,600
adrenaline's pumping life isn't easy

697
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,919
you're not eating good you're eating

698
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,480
more eggs than other Foods some other

699
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,639
things are happening then that bug can

700
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,320
grow and take advantage of that egg

701
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:25,080
inside the liver and they love the liver

702
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,960
because that's where most of the food is

703
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:33,240
so as the eggs enter the liver another

704
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,799
Feeding Frenzy occurs that gooey glue

705
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Trails up to that liver okay and the

706
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,799
viruses they don't have a mouth so

707
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,480
they're not eating like they're not

708
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,840
sitting down at a dinner table and they

709
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,840
got a fork and a knife and they're just

710
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,159
eating their food like that I know so

711
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,240
you know or they're not like an insect

712
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,159
an insect that's eating somehow or

713
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,279
drinking some kind of water off of a

714
00:33:53,159 --> 00:34:00,000
leaf you know somewhere that's not it at

715
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,480
all viruses absorb Trace particles of

716
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,880
the egg through their membranes and this

717
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,159
is how science and research get the best

718
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,159
of us they even get the best of the

719
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,839
smartest people out there in health

720
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,800
because we think about well viruses must

721
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,639
have a mouth they must chew they must

722
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,720
eat that can't happen it's impossible so

723
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:25,280
viruses don't eat science of research

724
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,159
knows that they can dumb us down by

725
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,639
saying viruses don't eat you know

726
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,879
because they can keep us like that

727
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,280
because in our minds in people's minds

728
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,679
cuz I talk to people all the time I talk

729
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,240
to doctors and they're like viruses eat

730
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,240
they're like what do they have a mouth

731
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,280
they don't have a mouth they don't start

732
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,119
chewing their food I've heard that from

733
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,879
doctors and I'm not talking about

734
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:51,280
inexperienced doctors either I'm talking

735
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,679
about renowned experts in their field

736
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,359
like the real thing like 30 years

737
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,000
experience 40 years experience seeing

738
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,240
all kinds of people droves coming into

739
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,280
their offices for years they've studied

740
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:07,680
in all different fields of medicine and

741
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,119
they can easily get tricked by this one

742
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,920
because human nature is to think

743
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,160
that if something eats it's got to eat

744
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,640
Chomp Chomp Chomp it's got to like eat

745
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,000
something and that's where they get us

746
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,240
in their grips the industry because we

747
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,920
just instantly think an animal or an

748
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,680
insect has a mouth and just eats and so

749
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,200
what we need to know something about

750
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,760
this is that viruses and bacteria not

751
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,920
only eat but they

752
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,200
eliminate poison so they excrete poison

753
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,280
because what goes in has to come out

754
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,560
it's like anybody that eats really right

755
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,240
but viruses and pathogens absorb the

756
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,960
food through their membrane and then

757
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:57,319
release poisons and toxins through the

758
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,920
membrane out so that's how it's done and

759
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,520
this waste matter is highly toxic it

760
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,640
builds up in the liver over time makes

761
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,119
your liver stagnant sluggish and then

762
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,079
you get the heart

763
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,480
palpitations you get the weight starts

764
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,200
coming on the hot flashes the night

765
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,920
sweats you get a little bit of energy

766
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,800
loss digestion system doesn't work good

767
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,920
anymore all these different things

768
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,920
happen the viruses feed off of the goo

769
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,280
that's sitting inside the liver over

770
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,920
time and then you're like wait a minute

771
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,760
I exercise I take care of myself and

772
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,640
wait I got this pound on me this extra

773
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,680
pound when do I have an extra pound or

774
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,160
two more why is weight coming on easier

775
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,160
now like it doesn't make sense is it

776
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,040
because I'm aging is it because I'm

777
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,000
getting older and the pounds are coming

778
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,680
on it makes somebody gain weight to

779
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,400
people who feel like they would never

780
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,400
gain a pound ever in their life and they

781
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,160
start start gaining weight and some

782
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,200
people gain that weight so early in life

783
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,839
in their 20s and teens and it just

784
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,960
happens because the liver gets maxed out

785
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,920
easy and it gets filled up with all

786
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,599
these toxins and bugs the very thing

787
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,119
viruses and bacteria you guys know what

788
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm talking about and as each year goes

789
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:23,440
by in your life in anyone's life a new

790
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,680
symptom or condition can develop or an

791
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,760
old symptom can come back and go and

792
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,920
come back and next thing you know it

793
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,880
your acne is back next thing you know it

794
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,839
you have acne for the first time or

795
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,800
eczema for the first time or psoriasis

796
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,280
or like I said before like weight is

797
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,960
gaining now and it's like why is the

798
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,400
weight coming on and or migraines or

799
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,680
floaters in the eyes or any kind of body

800
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,960
pain

801
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,240
fatigue and that's because the bugs are

802
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,920
starting to live their life inside of

803
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,920
our bodies and we're feeding these bugs

804
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,480
as we're living our life as each year

805
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,280
goes by but look look look the process

806
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,160
of developing symptoms and conditions

807
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,599
depends on a lot of factors I'm not

808
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,920
saying eggs are the sole reason out

809
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,520
there why everybody's sick it is one of

810
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,200
the sole reasons of how viruses and

811
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,480
bacteria started and were released into

812
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:26,640
the world but there's all these other

813
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,920
factors that allows the viruses to turn

814
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,040
into a sickness and eating eggs yes

815
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,119
that's one of them but there's other

816
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,720
things too it depends on what bug

817
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,560
somebody has is it aggressive is it

818
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,880
severe what kind of strain is is it what

819
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,200
kind of mutation is it what variety or

820
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,880
how weaken somebody's immune system is

821
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,280
it's important to keep our immune system

822
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,560
strong you guys it's so important I talk

823
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,800
about that for over 35 years but we

824
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,359
weaken our immune systems because life

825
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,720
is not easy here and it can happen to

826
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,680
any of us at any time we go through

827
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,520
emotional struggles that's a trigger we

828
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:11,800
go through hardships we get exposed to

829
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:14,200
pesticides and toxic heavy metals and

830
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,640
herbicides and all kinds of other things

831
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:20,680
too but it all depends on how many good

832
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,160
things you're doing for yourself what

833
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,800
tools are you using for yourself for

834
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,319
example are you doing the celery juice

835
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,480
because that's a tool to help clean up

836
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:34,640
the mess to help clean up the liver get

837
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:37,920
bugs out cuz the celery juice helps to

838
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,880
kill off bugs by destroying the membrane

839
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,079
that they use to even eat Foods they

840
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,200
like like eggs see so while bugs are

841
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,680
making mess inside of you all kinds of

842
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,520
messes you're working on cleaning up the

843
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,880
mess too at the same time so what tools

844
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,920
are you using and then it falls into

845
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,800
this whole thing check this out okay

846
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,040
like you're doing a tool that's good for

847
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,079
you you're using something that's good

848
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,040
like celery juice but you're still

849
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,839
eating eggs on your avocado toast see

850
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:13,200
and yeah you can still get acne or maybe

851
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,200
not acne as bad because your celery

852
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,079
juice is keeping things at Bay so you

853
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,280
can do things that are helping while

854
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,160
you're doing things that are hurting

855
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,440
look it's not your fault that you might

856
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,480
be doing something that's hurting they

857
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:33,000
ruined our eggs they did they destroyed

858
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,240
our eggs made them a problem it's not

859
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,599
like I got something against eggs and

860
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,680
you're doing something terrible far from

861
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,599
it you're trying to eat you're trying to

862
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,960
survive trying to live your life and I'm

863
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:47,480
trying to help you and trying to make

864
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,200
sure you have the info so you can

865
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,960
protect yourself so the industry doesn't

866
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,520
win you know the darkness the darkness

867
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,200
that the that's involved the game they

868
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,640
play they created the bugs they made a

869
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,240
world of sickness they make trillions of

870
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,520
dollars as the years come and the

871
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,560
centuries go by and you don't have to be

872
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,319
a part of that entirely you be like you

873
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,599
know what I can keep my eggs out but say

874
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,560
you want to keep your eggs in what tools

875
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:19,640
are you doing are you doing some celery

876
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,880
juice are you eating good overall are

877
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,960
you bringing in herbs wild foods are you

878
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,440
building up your immune system

879
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,440
do you know how to take care of yourself

880
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,839
cleanse the liver everything matters but

881
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,400
acne can sneak up on anybody when you're

882
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:40,560
still doing things that can feed the

883
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,520
bugs like eating the eggs this reminds

884
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,400
me of

885
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,680
cocaine like the binging out that

886
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,319
happened well happens today people are

887
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,280
on cocaine every day but it reminds me

888
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,760
of the late 70s and early 80s and mid

889
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,040
80s there was this trend and and I've

890
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,400
talked to a doctor about this and he was

891
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,880
talking to me about it he said you know

892
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,240
what's funny he goes this trend was

893
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,680
crazy back then it was like happening he

894
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,480
had patients come into the office that

895
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:10,640
were cocaine addicts and um so what

896
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,480
happened was people were snorting

897
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,040
cocaine for 3 days straight they didn't

898
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,880
eat anything they didn't drink anything

899
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,359
like they do now but they weren't taking

900
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,280
care of themselves of course you just go

901
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,760
on a binge and you just stay awake you

902
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,920
don't sleep a wink and you just do it

903
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,359
for 3 days until you crash and you burn

904
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,079
out you sleep and then you wake up and

905
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:36,000
then you look around and you head to the

906
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:39,040
health food store or to some store that

907
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,880
sells a bottle of vitamin C doesn't

908
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,880
matter junkiest stuff on the planet just

909
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,520
a bottle of vitamin C and you down it

910
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,480
and this trend was so you can do more

911

so you can get back on the game the

914
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:01,240

binge on cocaine you don't sleep a wink

916
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,079

918
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:13,480

00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,400
you burn you go to sleep you wake up

920
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,920
you're like what and then you're back at

921
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,280
the store for more vitamin C that's what

922
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,520
it was that's what it was about sound

923
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,440
familiar you're eating pretty good no

924
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,079
processed foods your ex exercizing no

925
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,680
gluten you're staying hydrated drinking

926
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,559
more water and you have a cheat day or a

927
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:41,240
binge weekend and you're eating whatever

928
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,839
and now comes Monday you're trying to

929
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,119
work it out in the gym you're doing

930
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:47,240
extra exercises you're drinking lots of

931
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,599
water you're trying to flush your system

932
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,520
you're trying to look into some kind of

933
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,960
neat little trendy cleanse out there and

934
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,200
you're gluten-free for a little bit

935
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,359
longer you're staying away from the

936
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,000
chocolate cake or some kind of cake and

937
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,760
then you do it again and you have your

938
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,640
cheat weekend again right but here's the

939
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,640
difference with eggs you don't know it's

940
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,960
a

941
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,119
problem you have no

942
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,000
idea nobody's going to tell you it's

943
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,040
classified information you're hearing it

944
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,079
for the first time in your life here on

945
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,760
this podcast or unless you read the

946
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,000
medical medium books

947
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,559
so that's the difference what is the

948
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,440
difference it's stealth it's classified

949
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:36,040
it's there to mess your life up and you

950
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,960
don't know it's bad so you're eating the

951
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,040
eggs You Got the Whole Foods you got the

952
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,480
eggs you got this good diet going on you

953
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,720
got your egg on the avocado toast you

954
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,920
got your egg your scrambled eggs in the

955
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,520
morning without your toast because you

956
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,680
don't want then the carbs so you're just

957
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,440
doing plain old straight scrambled eggs

958
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,319
with maybe a vegetable or an omelette

959
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,720
right and you don't know it that the

960
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:00,640
eggs are bad mad cuz the classified

961
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,599
industry ruined them on you and no one

962
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,280
told you and then you don't even get a

963
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,960
choice like the cocaine addict does cuz

964
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,640
the cocaine addict knows that cocaine is

965
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,720
bad for them they know it they're not

966
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,880
like oh this stuff is so good for me let

967
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,520
me snort another line like this stuff is

968
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,800
so good for me no they know it's bad

969
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,359
they're just stuck in the addiction

970
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,280
right but they get at least a chance

971
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,599
when they wake up out of that addiction

972
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,400
for a second to take care of themselves

973
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,160
a little bit like maybe take some

974
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,359
vitamin C but you don't get that chance

975
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,440
so you can't even counter your egg

976
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,119
addiction that nobody told you was a

977
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:45,000
problem so you don't even get the choice

978
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,319
unless you counter it by accident like

979
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,160
you're doing your celery juice as a tool

980
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:51,680
or you're eating good in other ways or

981
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,160
you're taking care of yourself or you're

982
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,480
getting a lot of sleep like whatever it

983
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,319
is you're countering it

984
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:04,040
and you're countering it by accident but

985
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:07,160
you know the scoop now eaters lose all

986
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:10,839
that's a scoop a classified industry

987
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,319
took your egg used it raised all these

988
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:18,880
pathogens created a world of sickness

989
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:21,520
pain and suffering with your egg okay

990
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,520
now you know like millions of other

991
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,720
people know the truth from medical

992
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,359
medium information that eggs are a

993
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,839
problem now now you have the choice to

994
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:34,880
do what a cocaine addict does take

995
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:37,880
vitamin C in between binging but your

996
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,800
choice is like hey I can actually do

997
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,680
some more celery juice take care of

998
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,559
myself better if I really want to keep

999
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,920
my eggs around at least you have a

1000
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:52,000
choice but as time goes by and the eggs

1001
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,520
build up inside the liver and we have

1002
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,680
different relationships we spread more

1003
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,160
bugs around pass more bugs around we go

1004
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,960
into restaurants I've had people tell me

1005
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,880
that they find Band-Aids in their salads

1006
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,480
in some of the finest restaurants

1007
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,880
because chefs cut their fingers people

1008
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,240
who are working in the industry cut

1009
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,480
their fingers they got Band-Aids on and

1010
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,839
we collect more bugs we collect them

1011
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,359
from public bathrooms we collect them

1012
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:21,760
from all kinds of different ways so as

1013
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:25,359
time goes on the scale tips and it's not

1014
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,920
about juggling it anymore the scale tips

1015
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:32,640
all of sudden the bad outweighs the good

1016
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:34,359
it's not 5050 kind of ebing and flowing

1017
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,640
where you're getting a symptom here or a

1018
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:38,839
symptom there or you're feeling pretty

1019
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,079
good and all is well but you're kind of

1020
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:41,960
doing some good things for yourself

1021
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,839
you're gluten-free you might drink some

1022
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,359
celery juice you might try something

1023
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,480
else and no processed foods you're

1024
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,920
eating a few other good foods you're

1025
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,319
taking care of yourself getting more

1026
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:56,960
sleep but the scale tips we collect all

1027
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,680
these new bugs we we live our life we

1028
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,920
get more toxic our liver gets filled up

1029
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,880
with more poisons and toxins we collect

1030
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:08,960
more toxic heavy metals and then boom

1031
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,359
someone breaks up with us betrayal our

1032
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,440
adrenals are running we're in fight or

1033
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,359
flight our immune systems lowering we

1034
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,440
have some kind of relationship break up

1035
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:23,520
or a divorce somebody cheats on us or

1036
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:26,559
broken trust and that's there and the

1037
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:30,559
scale is tipping and the eggs are still

1038
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,480
in there they're still there and as more

1039
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,200
and more cheat days happen you can't

1040
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,960
kind of have your cheat days anymore

1041
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,839
like that's not an option you need to do

1042
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,520
more because as you're going through

1043
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,480
life the scale is so tipped you're

1044
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,040
starting to get a little bit of eczema

1045
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,400
now more bloating maybe your

1046
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,400
reproductive system isn't functioning

1047
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,760
quite like it should and you get a cyst

1048
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,520
for the first time in your life maybe

1049
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:03,839
hypothyroid maybe that happens and the

1050
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:07,359
scale gets tipped too far but if the

1051
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,720
eggs are still there you have a choice

1052
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,839
you can take them out you can get rid of

1053
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:16,559
them and at least Levy the playing field

1054
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,079
again bring in some more tools and you

1055
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,359
guys get the tools from the medical

1056
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,440
medium info so you can deal with your

1057
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:25,760
heart PPS your fatigue your anxiety and

1058
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,319
depression and your hair falling out and

1059
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,000
the bloating and the thyroid problems

1060
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:31,599
but what if what if here's somebody else

1061
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,839
the millions of people out there that

1062
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,079
don't have these tools and even know

1063
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,400
that the egg is not a good thing and

1064
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,680
it's not helping them they just start

but doesn't know why you're sick he runs

1090
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,599
a bunch of tests asks what you're eating

1091
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,119
tells you to eat eggs you go to your

1092
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:55,839
nutritionist your nutritionist doesn't

1093
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,160
know why you're sick does the diet

1094
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:00,000
analysis probably tells you never to

1095
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,280
cleanse tells you that your body

1096
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,359
cleanses on its own or something like

1097
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,599
that and then tells you to eat

1098
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:10,280
eggs you go to your chiropractor and

1099
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:13,000
your chiropractor doesn't know why

1100
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,720
you're sick but they want to help with

1101
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,280
your diet too something that never did

1102
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,480
in the past that's something that

1103
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,799
developed in the last 20 years and

1104
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,839
they'll tell you to go eat eggs you go

1105
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:25,559

doesn't know why you're sick with this

1108
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,680
chronic illness and doesn't know why

1109
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,319
you're suffering from all these

1110
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,839
different symptoms but they'll tell you

1111
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:37,359
to eat eggs you talk to your health

1112
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,880

1113
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,559
what's wrong with you but they'll tell

1114
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,520
you to go eat eggs as well and get

1115
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:48,400
plenty of protein and whether you're

1116
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,040
sick or you're not sick at all whether

1117
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,319
you're somebody who's just partially

1118
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:58,359
sick or you're not sick yet you get told

1119
00:51:54,319 --> 00:52:00,559
to eat eggs look check this out okay

1120
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:03,000
public science and research medical

1121
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,839
science and research doesn't know why

1122
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,920
anybody's sick yet why do you think the

1123
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:08,359
theory of autoimmune is out there where

1124
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,359
they tell you your body's attacking

1125
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:13,040
itself which isn't true it's a theory

1126
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:15,559
was never proven and why do you think

1127
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,319
they say autoimmune is also cause

1128
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:21,400
unknown because science and research in

1129
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:26,000
the public Arena doesn't know why

1130
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:28,599
anyone's sick all right but classifi

1131
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,400
Private Industry that started the

1132
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:33,280
sickness the epidemic of the world

1133
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,040
sickness as we got today they know why

1134
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,160
you're sick the private classified

1135
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,760
industry they know why you're sick they

1136
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:43,599
started the whole mess they're the

1137
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,520
reason why the epidemic of chronic

1138
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:50,880
illness exists today they're the ones

1139
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,520
that created it but what's crazy is the

1140
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,119
public science of research and medical

1141
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,400
science of research all the experts and

1142
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,640
so forth they don't know why why

1143
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,160
anybody's sick they don't know why

1144
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,160
someone has eczema or lupus or what

1145
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,920
causes it and we can play that game all

1146
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:08,319
day long I think you get the picture

1147
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,480
though and a label is not the cause

1148
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,520
that's just to shut you up they still

1149
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,599
don't know why you're sick like with

1150
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:16,839
eczema it's like here's a cream good

1151
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:20,440
luck see you later that's what they'll

1152
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:22,319
say right and with everybody being such

1153
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,119
experts like the public science of

1154
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,839
research and medical science research

1155
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:28,040
all the medical community

1156
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,599
everybody thinking they're literally an

1157
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,359
expert in health science research

1158
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,720
studies all of it and what do they do

1159
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:38,520
when you get sick they tell you to eat

1160
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,520
eggs what about egg whites or home

1161
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,280
raised chicken eggs can you do those you

1162
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,720
know I got a friend who has a chicken

1163
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,839
shed and she lets out all the chickens

1164
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,559
and she tells me it's really healing and

1165
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,520
therapeutic they just go all squawking

1166
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:56,160
they go out they're pecking they're all

1167
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,880
out and about they're all over her yard

1168
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,400
she has a little fence going around the

1169
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,319
yard and she tells me Anthony they're

1170
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,520
eating insects they're eating seeds

1171
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:07,599
they're eating bugs they're eating grass

1172
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,359
they're eating leaves and she tells me

1173
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,240
all this stuff and then she'll throw her

1174
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:14,520
scraps that she has you know her

1175
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,079
vegetable scraps and she'll and her

1176
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,200
fruit scraps and she'll throw them out

1177
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,760
there and the chickens are all pecking

1178
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:24,520
through it she says it's the best thing

1179
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,680
ever but she's got neurological lime and

1180
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,760
she

1181
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,760
finally gave in she was like you know

1182
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,240
what I finally gave in I got the

1183
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,960
neurological lime I contacted you and

1184
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,559
you told me to get off the eggs and it

1185
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:42,520
broke her heart her heart was just

1186
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:45,359
broken from that and took a while to get

1187
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,520
past it now she just collects all the

1188
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,119
eggs which is still therapeutic and she

1189
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,000
gives them to her neighbor who has

1190
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,480
neurological lime but she gives them to

1191
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,240
her neighbor because her neighbor said

1192
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,000
she's not going to ever quit eggs she

1193
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,880
loves them and she's not going to give

1194
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,680
it up no matter what kind of Lyme

1195
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,280
disease symptoms She's suffering from so

1196
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,000
she brings them over to her neighbor cuz

1197
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:06,400
her neighbor's going to buy eggs anyway

1198
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,720
and these are the best eggs because they

1199
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,960
ruined our eggs it doesn't matter if

1200
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:14,839
they're organic or free range or

1201
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,240
homegrown or from the best place on the

1202
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:20,400
planet that was taken away from us no

1203
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,119
matter what that's the hard part about

1204
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,200
all of this because the eggs will still

1205
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:27,280
feed the bugs in our bodies that to

1206
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,520
create all of our sicknesses and I get

1207
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,160
it you might be somebody that's like you

1208
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,400
know what I don't have bugs I just got

1209
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:36,240
to like something's a little off like my

1210
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,920
microbiome or maybe my adrenals or

1211
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,480
hormones are off or my digestion is off

1212
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,440
or I'm allergic to gluten or something

1213
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,880
and I got a great practitioner or a

1214
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,520
doctor and they're just telling me these

1215
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,200
things I get it if you're in that place

1216
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,039
in life I totally respect that and but

1217
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:54,599
what happens though when you've seen

1218
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:56,440
your 10th doctor and you're losing the

1219
00:55:54,599 --> 00:56:01,039
quality of of your life and the fatigue

1220
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:03,920
is so bad and your skin disorder is so

1221
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:06,079
hard on you and everything else then you

1222
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,200
just get to a point in your life after 5

1223
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,760
years of this or 10 years of this or

1224
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,520
maybe just a year of this where it's

1225
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,880
like okay what's wrong I need an answer

1226
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:18,240
because I've been there i' done that

1227
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,920
I've I've been around I'm

1228
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,200
seasoned what is the answer and then

1229
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,640
then it's like what okay wait a minute

1230
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,000
pathogens okay toxic heavy metals and

1231
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,280
what are the triggers because with

1232
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,400
people you can go down the road like

1233
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,400
everybody else and symptoms may come

1234
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,119
later you could be somebody that's

1235
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,240
exercising and you're not sick right now

1236
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,599
and all seems to be okay and then a

1237
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:46,000
divorce it's a crash and then your

1238
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,200
immune system crashes your adrenals are

1239
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,359
FL flooding or a bad breakup or you get

1240
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,640
cheated on or betrayal or a loss of a

1241
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,839
loved one or even

1242
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,920
childbirth that can lower the immune

1243
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:02,119
system I've talked about that before

1244
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,720
it's why so many moms get Hashimoto

1245
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:09,079
thyroiditis 3 months after they deliver

1246
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:12,480
a baby or they give birth and all these

1247
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:14,680
things can happen so heartache alone

1248
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,799
getting stabbed in the back is

1249
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:22,000
devastating surges that adrenaline

1250
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:26,039
lowers the immune system and the problem

1251
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:28,520
can develop months down the road and

1252
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:30,359
then there's other levels of stress too

1253
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,839
like a lot of levels of stress that we

1254
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:35,440
deal with and bugs can take ADV

1255
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:39,520
advantage of that when the immune system

1256
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,760
drops it's like when a woman gives birth

1257
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,119
her immune system is protecting the baby

1258
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:49,240
not the mom the baby and so because of

1259
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:51,079
that her immune system 50% of it during

1260
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,880
her pregnancy has been taking care of

1261
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:56,839
the child the other 50% is taking care

1262
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:00,200
of her but but things can happen because

1263
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:01,280
of that and then child birth itself it's

1264
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,559
over

1265
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,799
90% of the immune system is taking care

1266
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,000
of the baby to protect the child and

1267
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:11,839
that's why if a mom has something going

1268
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,960
on then all of a sudden the fatigue

1269
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,079
happens the hair loss happens um

1270
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:20,000
anything can happen after child birth

1271
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:22,960
it's it's well known women develop a lot

1272
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,319
of symptoms that reoccur later including

1273
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,119
severe depression anxiety

1274
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:30,559
but what's not known is why all these

1275
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,599
symptoms happened after child birth and

1276
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,760
months later after child birth research

1277
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:38,039
and science doesn't know why any of that

1278
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:40,400
happened and what the causes are and

1279
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:42,480
because and they don't know also about

1280
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,559
the immune system dropping during

1281
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:48,400
pregnancy and when giving birth and that

1282
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:50,559
every little bit counts for support with

1283
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,760
the immune system when you're pregnant

1284
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,760
and after giving birth but they don't

1285
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,000
know that part so then it becomes a

1286
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,599
mystery it's like okay your thyroid

1287
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,760
problems your hypothyroidism your hair

1288
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:06,440
falling out your migraines your aches

1289
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,039
and pains your fatigue and all of it we

1290
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:12,039
don't know why it's happening you just

1291
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:13,680
got autoimmune or maybe it's genetic

1292
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:16,359
maybe it's genes and they just start

1293
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,839
going down that road and but they don't

1294
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:20,799
know also what to do to protect you

1295
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:22,400
instead it'll be the opposite and

1296
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,920
they'll say well you need to rebuild

1297
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,640
after that pregnancy you need to rebuild

1298
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:30,160
after giving birth you should be eating

1299
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,079
lots of eggs so keep the eggs in there

1300
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,200
and that's recommended to every pregnant

1301
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,160
woman who's either pregnant or after

1302
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,440
they give birth it's the first thing

1303
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,680
that every health professional does or

1304
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:42,160
the second thing or the third thing is

1305
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,920
what are you eating are you eating your

1306
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:48,280
eggs so and at the same time the immune

1307
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,480
system is dropping the eggs are feeding

1308
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,680
more bugs nobody knows that's why all of

1309
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,400
a sudden someone has chronic fatigue

1310
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,559
syndrome and then we're back to this

1311
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,640
whole whole thing of nobody knowing and

1312
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,000
it's really sad look I understand if

1313
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:04,760
someone can't let go of their eggs it's

1314
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,920
a survival food for a lot of people now

1315
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,720
I got people friends that' be like look

1316
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,960
you can help me with anything don't

1317
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:17,240
touch my eggs Don't Go Near them it's my

1318
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,760
lifeblood it's my religion don't touch

1319
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,559
it like I've heard that by from friends

1320
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,480
I've heard that from even professionals

1321
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:25,960
that have reached out doctors that reach

1322
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,160
out for help and they're like why am I

1323
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:30,400
sick aw and they'll be like look I want

1324
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,559
you to do this do this do this and then

1325
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,559
eggs and they're like what all a sudden

1326
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:40,119
eggs like no way you can't go there and

1327
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:42,960
I get it completely you know and try to

1328
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:44,520
be kind of open to somebody else too

1329
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,079
when you give this information out to

1330
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,319
them like when you tell them look stay

1331
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,400
away from eggs cuz you might get the

1332
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,960
same kind of flak you might get hit with

1333
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,640
the same kind of stuff keep a mind you

1334
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,960
know keep your mind open and also be

1335
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:59,240
cautious like tread carefully because

1336
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,640
you wouldn't believe the kind of trouble

1337
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:05,559
I get about the egg thing and wasn't

1338
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,680
even my fault I didn't ruin the eggs the

1339
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:10,599
industry did you guys know you know

1340
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,000
what's funny you know what's funny if no

1341
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,200
one knows why you're sick then how does

1342
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,359
anyone know eggs are actually good for

1343
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:22,200
you if no one knows how to keep us from

1344
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:24,200
getting sick then why are eggs so good

1345
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,760
for us there's all these anti-aging

1346
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,960
people people out there they like

1347
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,520
anti-aging live longer but they make

1348
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,079
sure that you're on this balanced diet

1349
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,240
and you got your eggs in that diet too

1350
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,119
but the eggs aren't going to keep you

1351
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,440
living longer when you got all these

1352
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:41,599
bugs making you sicker and giving you

1353
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:44,319
diseases and conditions including cancer

1354
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,839
and all kinds of other things so it's

1355
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,760
not one of those longevity Foods so

1356
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:51,079
let's talk about science the science end

1357
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,640
of things right in your mind you might

1358
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:54,680
be somebody that's like well what about

1359
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:57,799
the evidence that eggs are really

1360
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:00,920
healthy for us okay what about that well

1361
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:02,839
it's funny because paid for science

1362
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:06,240
talking about eggs being that good for

1363
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:08,359
us doesn't know why anybody's sick

1364
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,119
that's incredible right or how about

1365
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:13,359
this paid for Science and

1366
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,520
studies not only doesn't know why

1367
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:19,119
anybody's

1368
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:22,319
sick but doesn't know classified private

1369
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:25,880
evil industry from the past ruined the

1370
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:27,720
eggs raised all the bugs that is sick so

1371
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,480
here they are talking about protein

1372
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,200
Source number one protein Source there's

1373
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,880
nothing wrong with eggs at all they're

1374
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:37,680
the perfect food that's the consensus

1375
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,720
they got the Omega-3s they got vitamins

1376
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,920
they got

1377
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:45,400
nutrients and that's what they'll do and

1378
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:48,599
it's all paid for studies what you won't

1379
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:50,839
find you won't find a paid for study or

1380
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:52,720
a bunch of paid for studies that

1381
01:02:50,839 --> 01:02:55,440
actually talk about why eggs are really

1382
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,480
not good for you and here's the other

1383
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,960
problem nobody knows in science land

1384
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,079
science and research land or medical

1385
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:06,680
science research land in public Arena

1386
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:09,839
not classified public Arena knows that

1387
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:12,000
those eggs will feed bugs so if that

1388
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:15,119
study ever happened on a public level it

1389
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,520
would be shut down faster than you could

1390
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,960
think it would a bomb would blow up in

1391
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:24,440
the place literally lab coats would be

1392
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,200
flying everywhere it would be a disaster

1393
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,200
that's what would happen if there was an

1394
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,319
actual study where they were discovering

1395
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,760
eggs actually feed the bugs keeping

1396
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:36,359
everybody sick and this stuff got out

1397
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,279
there forget it they don't want that

1398
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:41,319
chicken out of the chicken shed running

1399
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:43,640
down the street telling the truth about

1400
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:47,160
what they did to the eggs and why

1401
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:50,400
everybody's sick they'll never ever ever

1402
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,839
tell you that your bugs that are causing

1403
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,599
your sickness were because they raised

1404
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:57,920
them for decades in last abs and let

1405
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,920
them out they don't want that chicken

1406
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,160
out of the shed they don't want nobody

1407
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,880
knowing why you're sick they just don't

1408
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,200
and look they'll never tell you that the

1409
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,839
eggs you eat feed the bugs they raised

1410
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,520
in Labs no one will tell you it's the

1411
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:18,640
Wild Wild West when you get sick and

1412
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:20,880
that's how they love it they love that

1413
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,200
not the good people working for the good

1414
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,920
science of research and for the good

1415
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,400
meaning the good in pensions all the

1416
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,079
different health professionals that they

1417
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,319
got their heart in it and they want to

1418
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:33,319
heal people I'm not talking about that

1419
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:36,160
I'm talking about the classified Private

1420
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:39,200
Industry that started this epidemic of

1421
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,400
illness including what we're faced with

1422
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,920
today you're on your own when you get

1423
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,559
sick that's what

1424
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:49,720
happens and if you don't think so you'll

1425
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:52,200
realize that after you're fourth doctor

1426
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,640
that you're on your own and maybe you're

1427
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,520
someone that's not really sick or you

1428
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,839
got just a couple little symptoms and

1429
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:01,079
you're young and microbiome is an

1430
01:04:58,839 --> 01:05:03,000
example of making you kind of like

1431
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,160
thinking well everything's good candida

1432
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,119
I could deal with that um a little bit

1433
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:11,839
of a hormone imbalance digestion is off

1434
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:14,400
a little bit but man when you get sick

1435
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:16,960
sick and that eczema is getting really

1436
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,720
bad and your fatigue is getting worse

1437
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,000
and your brain fogs taking over and you

1438
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,279
got these unexplainable symptoms and

1439
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
you're on your third neurologist and you

1440
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:29,319
did all the testing and spent all this

1441
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,400
money and you got this neurological

1442
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:36,400
fatigue your anxiety's crippling then

1443
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,480
you want answers and they're not going

1444
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,920
to tell you why everybody's sick and

1445
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,640
they're just going to tell you you

1446
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,279
should be eating your eggs of course no

1447
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,559
processed foods don't do processed foods

1448
01:05:46,279 --> 01:05:51,599
you know but that's not enough that's

1449
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:53,799
not an answer and guess what plant-based

1450
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,119
is not enough either because I know it's

1451
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:57,640
some of you guys might be thinking that

1452
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:00,359
are plant-based like o I'm off the hook

1453
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:03,920
I'm off the hook man I don't eat eggs

1454
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:07,240
but the problem is plant basers always

1455
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,960
run back to eggs it's the first thing

1456
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:13,279
they run to when they get a symptom or

1457
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,799
they have a tooth problem cavity or an

1458
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:18,039
ache and a pain and then boom they're

1459
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:19,480
done with a plant-based diet they still

1460
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:21,680
keep some of to some of the tools that

1461
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,319
are in a plant-based diet like some of

1462
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,000
the philosophy that's in a plant-based

1463
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:28,680
diet the keep something but they'll

1464
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,799
bring eggs in as their first food or

1465
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,000
cheese they'll bring eggs or cheese

1466
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,680
they'll hit the dairy I get it I totally

1467
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,000
get it but being plant-based is not

1468
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,240
enough because there's also residue from

1469
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,359
years of eating eggs still inside the

1470
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,880
liver and if you're not cleansing or

1471
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:48,559
learning how to cleanse that out of your

1472
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,680
liver to begin with you can still get

1473
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,680
your first symptoms or your second

1474
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,279
symptoms or third symptoms or a new

1475
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,440
round of them while you're plant-based

1476
01:06:55,279 --> 01:07:01,200
unless you know why you got sick to

1477
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:04,240
begin with paleo carnivore that's not an

1478
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,559
answer fod map food combining clean

1479
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,359
eating random supplements and no

1480
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:12,160
processed foods are not enough and

1481
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:14,480
they're not answers medical M

1482
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,359
information is about answers yes getting

1483
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,119
rid of eggs is one of the options one of

1484
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:24,400
the choices you can make that can really

1485
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,920
help and if you've been to 10 doctors

1486
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,559
you're still going to be told to eat

1487
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,279
eggs maybe your plant-based doctor might

1488
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,400
be like no no eggs plant-based is the

1489
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:36,279
way to go but I've seen plant-based

1490
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:39,200
doctors get sick for the first time or

1491
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:41,520
for the third time and something doesn't

1492
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,480
feel right and they're off eating eggs

1493
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,960
they actually go get eggs themselves

1494
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,359
many people on a plant-based diet start

1495
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:53,119
just eating eggs again and they won't

1496
01:07:50,359 --> 01:07:55,359
rip eggs apart too bad it's so funny

1497
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,520
I've noticed in a plant-based movement

1498
01:07:55,359 --> 01:08:01,559
that eggs are coveted they're actually

1499
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,720
coveted because you never know when

1500
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:06,880
you're going to need to run back to them

1501
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:09,480
so when the symptoms get the best of you

1502
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:14,200
the first animal product you run to is

1503
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,040
those eggs and hey look that's okay it's

1504
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,319
like you get a little scared and you're

1505
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:21,719
like oh my God maybe eggs are something

1506
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,319
I need when the crap hits the fan it's

1507
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:26,759
the first place you go it's one of those

1508
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,759
Foods in the back of your mind that you

1509
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:31,920
can lean on when things get

1510
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:34,239
uncomfortable there's a law about eggs

1511
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,759
you don't mess with them it's the best

1512
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:38,880
food on the planet for you hands down

1513
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:41,359
that's what everybody's told you know

1514
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:44,440
what's a sick joke they raise viruses in

1515
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,159
a lab on eggs the viruses cause

1516
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:50,000
reproductive system diseases in women

1517
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:52,120
and then you tell women to eat eggs for

1518
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,600
their health which keeps feeding their

1519
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:58,239
viruses and making the reproductive

1520
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:02,120
system conditions worse it's really

1521
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:04,520
really evil look let's face it no one's

1522
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,679
allowed to talk bad about eggs it hits

1523
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,839
the emotional core it's a comfort food

1524
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,960
and considered a health food people

1525
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:14,440
start putting their hardboiled eggs over

1526
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:17,359
easy poached eggs on their salads they

1527
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:20,159
make egg sandwiches and burritos avocado

1528
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,279
toast with eggs I see it all the time

1529
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,359
there's people out there and they're

1530
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,279
like making their avocado toast and then

1531
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,600
all of a sudden here comes a fried egg

1532
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,239
out of nowhere and it gets put on top

1533
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,560
it's like wait a minute wait wait you

1534
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:33,600
didn't have to do that oh what and then

1535
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,080
or scrambled eggs I see that too you got

1536
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,759
avocado toast going on and all of a

1537
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:40,199
sudden now there's a scrambled egg on

1538
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:43,640
top and problem is with that then the

1539
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:46,319
acne comes 3 months later or 2 months

1540
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:47,799
later and nobody knows why it's like

1541
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,839
wait a minute why am I getting a new

1542
01:09:47,799 --> 01:09:55,000
bout of acne or why am I getting acne at

1543
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:57,640
all is it hormones no it's it's the eggs

1544
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,080
it was feeding something inside of you

1545
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,360
and you're not going to blame the eggs

1546
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:03,440
ever even if you knew the truth

1547
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,080
sometimes people still won't go there

1548
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,840
it's like okay I know the truth but

1549
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,400
there's no way I'm going there the

1550
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,760
classified industry loves how we love

1551
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,040
our eggs that's the first thing they

1552
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,360
also love how we don't know what they

1553
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:21,400
did to our eggs they want us to marry

1554
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,760
those eggs till death do us part that's

1555
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:26,880
what they want it's like an insurance

1556
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:30,120
policy to guarantee we all get sick

1557
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,679
someday they want our bugs to be fed did

1558
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,840
you hear that that was the plan and then

1559
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:36,239
sell

1560
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,159
Pharmaceuticals keep people sick for

1561
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:41,719
also other reasons too reasons that

1562
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:43,760
aren't so great and it feeds the

1563
01:10:41,719 --> 01:10:46,480
industry and the industry's favorite

1564
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:49,320
thing of all is that not only do we not

1565
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:52,960
have a clue but we treat eggs like it's

1566
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:55,960
the air we breathe we never question it

1567
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,880
it's going to go on on forever and ever

1568
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,120
and ever did you ever see that movie

1569
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:02,360
Invasion of the Body Snatchers it's an

1570
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,719
old movie from many years ago they leave

1571
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,080
a pod by your bed that looks like a

1572
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,880
cabbage so when you get sleepy and

1573
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:11,640
you're ready to go to bed you're getting

1574
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:15,159
all comfy and you're tired and then you

1575
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:18,719
start falling asleep okay your body gets

1576
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:21,000
taken over by a replica of yourself but

1577
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:24,199
the difference is you end up mindless

1578
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,640
your body was snatched and you do as

1579
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:29,120
they say well this egg thing is kind of

1580
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,400
like that we mindlessly eat our eggs and

1581
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,120
we shut up about them okay don't say

1582
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,159
nothing bad because you'll get your

1583
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,800

even our families they're taking over by

1604
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:29,679
the body snatcher pod and you're the

1605
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:32,520

1606
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,600
say you don't want your eggs and you

1607
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,840
tell them that those eggs are bad for

1608
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:40,400
you then they'll leave a pod by your bed

1609
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,239
and you'll get snatched you'll eat the

1610
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:46,480
eggs for the rest of your life and

you'll be eating eggs all the time look

1612
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,920
I get it no one wants to know they got

1613
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,600
bugs in them no one wants to know that

1614
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,960
they're feeding their bugs with their

1615
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,840
favorite food when you think about that

1616
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,639

better getting rid of eggs is a good

1642
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,600
start a really good

1643
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:13,080
start they took a survival food the

1644
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,840
innocent egg that we relied upon

1645
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:20,040
utilized and needed for hundreds of

1646
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:22,760
years and turn this food the egg against

1647
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,520
us without our permission taking

1648
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,560
something precious and meaningful that

1649
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:32,280
was ours and weaponized it and raised

1650
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:35,560
the very pathogens that are responsible

1651
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:38,199
for sickness today without us knowing

1652
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,080
without us seeing and without us getting

1653
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:44,639
a chance to stand up for ourselves and

1654
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:47,560
make a choice to protect our egg and be

1655
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:50,800
able to decide for ourselves what is

1656
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:53,480
right as we walk our path we want things

1657
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,040
to be as they are not something else

1658
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:59,040
that we know nothing about there's a

1659
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:01,800
feeling that overcomes us all every time

1660
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,199
we're in a store you remember it right

1661
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,440
as you're grabbing a dozen eggs or more

1662
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:09,239
there's an emotional attachment as we

1663
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,760
open the carton hatch an automatic

1664
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:14,520
button in us to make sure each one is

1665
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,960
perfect and not one of them is cracked

1666
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,560
we learn this from the beginning of our

1667
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,719
life it's part of a deep emotional

1668
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,199
connection before we're taught to

1669
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:26,920
scramble or fry

1670
01:15:24,199 --> 01:15:29,760
they took a legendary food from us

1671
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:32,679
surrounded by life-saving Glory they

1672
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,760
snatched it away from us all and created

1673
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:37,840
a forever lasting gory leading to

1674
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,480
sickness of millions of people but

1675
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,000
you're not supposed to know that story

1676
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:46,040
the egg was used to take the breath away

1677
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,000
of so many who did no wrong it caused a

1678
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:51,600
historical neurological problem and some

1679
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,400
ended up in the iron lung as the

1680
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,639
innocent people stared at at the mirror

1681
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,679
they couldn't go anywhere they were

1682
01:15:56,639 --> 01:16:02,440
filled with Terror they no longer could

1683
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,639
look up and see the church St unless

1684
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:05,360
they were looking down at the floor in

1685
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,800
the

1686
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:12,480
mirror how did this happen and what was

1687
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:15,840
the way the truth is that men in the lab

1688
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:19,040
coats opened the egg research and

1689
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:22,920
science turned against this overnight in

1690
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:26,040
just one day what does it matter and

1691
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:28,600
there eyes it was six of one half dozen

1692
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,760
of the other and who cared if each of

1693
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,760
the eggs they opened up were from a

1694
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:37,880
different hand mother what they did to

1695
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:40,560
us and our eggs is surreal shows us once

1696
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:43,760
again that the spiritual war both around

1697
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,639
us and above us is real and that

1698
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:49,880
Darkness runs man and the industries and

1699
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:52,600
tries to decide how we receive our pain

1700
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:55,239
and our suffering but this doesn't have

1701
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:58,080
to be our Our Fate we have our own free

1702
01:16:55,239 --> 01:17:00,800
will to take control over our health and

1703
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:03,400
not throw it all away because they know

1704
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,159
nothing we can make our own decisions

1705
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,280
and choices as we learn how to overcome

1706
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:12,760
and beat them at their own game and as

1707
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:16,239
we battle Darkness on our own terms not

1708
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:19,000
their terms they're not the same using

1709
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:22,520
the tools and the knowledge and the

1710
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,560
inside truth from way above we can see

1711
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,400

01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:28,320
