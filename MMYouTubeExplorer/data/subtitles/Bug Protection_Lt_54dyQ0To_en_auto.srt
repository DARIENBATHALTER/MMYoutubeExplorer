in the morning you do two dropper holes

145
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,320
later on in the day or at night

146
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
since i'm telling family right now so

147
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
just two dropper holes twice a day you

148
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,479
could be somebody you can do six tiny

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
drops and then

150
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,639

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000

167
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,120
people run themselves down greatly and

168
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,720
then you got the critters going around

169
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,960
and everybody's got the critters going

170
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
around so that's something you know that

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
we have to look out for

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,240

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,360
it matters it's just the brand i love

188
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
and i know these guys you know become

189
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
good friends with them throughout the

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
years because of what they've done and i

191
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
reach out to all the supplement

192
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
companies and all the different

193
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,000
companies out there and i try to become

194
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,880
friends with them so then

195
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,800
then they can respect what i'm asking

196
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,039
them to like make sure that the stuff

197
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,319
stays clean to make sure the quality is

198
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
there to make sure they don't cut

199
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,720
corners to make sure there's no citric

200
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,639
acid to make sure there's no fillers in

201
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
there to make sure there's nothing bad

202
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,360
in there

203
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
and so what i love about the vimergy

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,800
company is they went above that they've

205
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,560
even superseded anything i've ever asked

206
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,080
anything i've ever questioned they

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,599
superseded

208
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,360
way above

209
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,639
and they're just like no we we we're

210
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
going to take it to a level no one's

211
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,160
ever seen before in our history of the

212
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,919
supplement world so that's why i use

213
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
those henna says yes quality matters

214
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,199

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,560
just

236
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,080
goes over anything i've ever seen out

237
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,520
there in the olive leaf world so that's

238
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
what's incredible about this one and

239
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,120
that one i'm really excited about

240
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,240
because i've been able to offer friends

241
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,479
and family something else that's really

242
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,280
potent for what we're dealing with right

243
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,520
now so what we're dealing with right now

244
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,360

if you guys don't know vimergy it's

255
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,440
vimergy i'm not sponsored it's just the

256
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
stuff is that good

257
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,839
and you'll see i'm always talking about

258
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,920
vimergy uh mostly lately in the

259
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,600
supplement world because what happens is

260
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
with supplement companies they're all

261
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,040
trying to cut corners

262
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
and ever since the whole thing that

263
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,640
happened right the whole thing that

264
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
happened in the last couple years with

265
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,480
what we're dealing with

266
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
um it's it the supplement companies out

267
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
there because i've been talking to a lot

268
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,360
of them just doing like some balance and

269
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
check with them like are you keeping out

270
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,720
the natural flavors are you keeping out

271
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,040
the citric acid to these other companies

272
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
and they're like look aw we can't be

273
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,000
perfect

274
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,680
you wouldn't believe i was

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
i can't say the name of the supplement

276
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,399
company

277
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,600
but i had a meeting with a supplement

278
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,880
company last week right and it was to be

279
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
like look you guys i can show your stuff

280
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440

their stuff

282
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,000
if you take out this and this and this

283
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,279
you can't have the citric acid in there

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,959
you can't have the natural flavors in

285
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,240
there and this is what this is what the

286
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,880
ceo said to me the ceo said this to me

287
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,440

like we can't be perfect you don't

302
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,920

afford this or can't afford that i'm

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519

shoot some of that in

369
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,600
that ten to one

370
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,639
that that stuff

371
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,639
that's potent like

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,959
the thing is with the ten to one lemon

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,160
balm when it's a quality like this

374
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
is that when you send it down

375
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,320
you don't need

376
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,600
pot you don't need pot

377
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
people who are possible i'm not a pot

378
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,959
smoker

379
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,079
but people are pot smokers

380
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,720
like

381
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,880
send down the ten to one

382
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,279
and you're not gonna need pot

383
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,480
just give it some time

384
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,760
everybody who's like addicted to

385
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,120
marijuana and everybody's addicted to

386
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
marijuana out there because it's a big

387
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,760
people just smoking it left and right

388
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,519
right

389
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,880
they even kept at the same price so if

390
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,399
energy kept the same price right

391
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,199
companies would never do that companies

392
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,519
don't make the ten to one

393
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,040
so because when i was talking to the ceo

394
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,040
of this other supplement company that

395
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,440
was reaching out to me

396
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,920
and and and i said can you do any ten to

397
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,120
one or like no no way in hell we can

398
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,959
never do that

399
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
we could never do that we'd have to

400
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,320
charge a billion dollars for it i'm like

401
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
you guys are just so lame anyway they

402
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
kept it the same price but it's ten to

403
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,079
one

404
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
but i know everybody's smoking marijuana

405
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,160
these days because i know i hear about

406
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,959
it 24 7 out there right

407
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,959
and i'm like try a ten to one lemon balm

408
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,320
for the nervous system and brain for the

409
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,800
central nervous system for the brain

410
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,440
stem and then you might be able to

411
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,040
actually give up your pot addiction

412
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
you might be able to give up your pot

413
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
addiction we're talking about building

414
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
up our system because of everything

415
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,839
happening right now so i got to stay on

416
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,199
track talking about pot right now might

417
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,600
not be the

418
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,760
most productive thing

419
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,360
so let's let's let's talk about the

420
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
vitamin c

421
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
that's the microc

422
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,040
so

423
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,519
i wasn't going to do a live for a while

424
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,000
because i got a lot going on

425
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,440
but i'm getting phone calls

426
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,519
and texts

427
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,639
left and right people i haven't talked

428
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,920
to in years that are coming down with

429
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,440
the critter

430
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,639
right now they're coming down with a

431
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
case of the critters they got the chills

432
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,399
they don't feel good they got the

433
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
temperature they're coughing they got

434
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
the sniffles they got all that so

435
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,440
they're coming down with a case of the

436
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,320
critters and

437
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
and so that's why and i know that a lot

438
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
of people are up against that right now

439
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,560
with the holiday and everything so i

440
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,199
just wanted to cover just a couple

441
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,760
little things about it

442
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,399
so we got the the micro c so we do two

443
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,399
500

444
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,920
this is vitamin c shock therapy you guys

445
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,519
medical medium vitamin c shock therapy

446
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,199
let me move stuff over

447
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
right

448
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
we can do that right in here

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,480
so i'm going to open up two capsules

450
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
right

451
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,199
do this every two hours

452
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,279
every waking two hours you got something

453
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,720
happening you're coming down with

454
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,079
something

455
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
you're coming down the case of the

456
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,480
critters

457
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,680
do the microc two capsules every two

458
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
hours that's what i would do do what

459
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,759
your doctor tells you i'm just telling

460
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,440

463
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,959
it's of emerging microc easiest stuff on

464
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,920
the stomach and the most potent

465
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,759
right

466
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,920

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
problem all right so talk about other

625
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,440
stuff for the immune system here's an

626
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,360
incredible an incredible product right

627
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,280
here

628
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,520
this is a system builder

629
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,120
and this is the elderberry syrup now you

630
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
might be like well i've heard of

631
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,600
elaborate syrup before i've seen it you

632
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:36,000
can get elderberry syrup in the store

633
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,520
you can't get this elderberry syrup

634
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
this is from

635
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,840
freshly

636
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,880
juiced elderberries

637
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,799
this is from juiced elderberries

638
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,799
all elderberry syrups

639
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,720
are

640
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,200
they're dried

641
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,520
and then boiled

642
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
so there's a big difference right there

643
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,960
so this is the vimergio library syrup

644
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,159
the other difference in the elderberry

645
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,840
syrup here it's got mulberry extract

646
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,360
so it's got a highly

647
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,280
medicinal charge to it with that

648
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,919
mulberry tree

649
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,600
mulberries from the big mulberry trees

650
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
put into here too so it's got the

651
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,520
mulberry extra extract

652
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,000
in with the elderberry that's juiced

653
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,760
with vitamin c

654
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,679
and there's nothing out there like it so

655
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,360
this is basically

656
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,880
what i love about like the vimergy

657
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,159
elderberry syrup and it's got the micro

658
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,080
seen it what i love about the vimergy

659
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,120
elderberry syrup is

660
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,440
they're like

661
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,960
the forefront

662
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
everybody's talking a good game out

663
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,720
there like do this do this because of

664
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,880
what's going on out there do this

665
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,039
because of all the you know the what

666
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,200
people are up against it's like really

667
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,000
no these guys are like

668
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
all the way on the forefront leading the

669
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
way

670
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,880
companies can't touch them they can't

671
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
touch them like they couldn't even do

672
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
this

673
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
it wouldn't be possible for them to

674
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,159
create this product companies could

675
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
never do it

676
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,000
they would have to charge a billion

677
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
dollars i'm just exaggerating for that

678
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,440
but they have to charge

679
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,640
so much

680
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
and they couldn't do it anyway they

681
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
wouldn't have that they wouldn't have

682
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,880
the connections or the technology so

683
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,440
there's no cane sugar in here

684
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,840
so that's important to know

685
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,679
there's no cane sugar in here

686
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,039
so this is

687
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,520
literally a forefront product to build a

688
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,200
system that no one has ever

689
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,320
seen before

690
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,880
and if they didn't do that i wouldn't be

691
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,799
sitting here talking about it but it's

692
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,200
they're just they're creating things

693
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,279
that i can't help but to talk about

694
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,039
because it's like that it's off the

695
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,799
chart so when you're talking about

696
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,000
mulberry extract

697
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000
and then

698
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,400
juiced elderberry

699
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,200
and then

700
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,640
honey instead of cane syrup

701
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,799
a cane sugar honey instead of cane sugar

702
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,000
and then micro c

703
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,919
all in an elderberry syrup

704
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,799
you can't there's like you can't touch

705
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
that

706
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,799
you can do one tablespoon of this stuff

707
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,640
you can do

708
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,600
two tablespoons of this stuff you can do

709
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,360
a day i'm telling if you're sick i mean

710
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
i would be like a tablespoon three times

711
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,120
a day if you're sick i mean that's what

712
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
i would do if i was sick and i was

713
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,600
coughing and i would had a sore throat i

714
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,880
mean immune was down low low low low low

715
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,760
but definitely so it's just

716
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,520
no one can touch this product

717
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,159
i'm just letting you guys know and

718
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,520
that's the vimergy all the berries syrup

719
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,200
and

720
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
i always i always say it's like

721
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,799
basically the bottom line when it comes

722
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,039
down to it i'm like

723
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,279
how do you battle darkness right and

724
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,679
darkness is

725
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,520
what creates all the sickness out there

726
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,840
that's what darkness does right well how

727
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,840
do you battle it you need companies that

728
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,760
are light workers

729
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,559
and that's the thing out there they're

730
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,640
not just in it for profit and it's just

731
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,600
profit alone right you need companies

732
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,440
that are light workers that say well we

733
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,080
can battle

734
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,600
that darkness by doing something the

735
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,640
darkness did not expect

736
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,279
the darkness did not expect

737
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,440
like weapons like this

738
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,080
so darkness creates

739
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,279
what you see out there happening right

740
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,480
with all the games and all the different

741
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,960
critters

742
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,640
that everybody's up against everybody

743
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,200
coughing and sick

744
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,960
darkness purposely creates all that

745
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
to keep people down

746
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,720
to break them down

747
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,840
to torture them

748
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,480
and then you need like you need

749
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,400
light

750
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
with technology right so you need

751
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,520
companies that actually want to work for

752
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,039
the light

753
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
right you need companies that want to

754
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,080
work for god

755
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
companies that want to work for jesus

756
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
christ companies that want to work for

757
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,559
the light companies want to work for

758
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,480
they want to work for you know

759
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,679
the light of the universe right but the

760
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,240
point is is

761
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,000
that's how you battle darkness is you

762
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,360
create things that darkness never

763
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
expected

764
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,000
or never saw coming and that's what the

765
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,080
library so when i talk about when i talk

766
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,760
to a friend about it

767
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,039
i'll be like you will not see anything

768
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
like this

769
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,960
and this is to kind of upgrade for what

770
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,960
the darkness does so

771
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,880
to you know important things when you

772
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,520
think about it

773
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,480
really important

774
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,600
let's make a little time water

775
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,600
you could try that you guys

776
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
honor to have you guys here i'm talking

777
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,799
about building up your system protecting

778
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
your system that's the vitamin c shock

779
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,399
therapy right there i'm going to move it

780
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
over

781
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,960
okay and you can essentially do anything

782
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,880
you can take ginger

783
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,559
you can grate it you can chop it up you

784
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,640
can throw it into some hot water you can

785
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,480
make ginger water

786
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,919
so and just so you know if energy has

787
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,120
distributors around the world go to the

788
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,279
website bimrgy.com visa victor i am as

789
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
ergy vimorgy.com and look for the

790
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,960
distributed distributor that's closest

791
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,799
to you around the world if you're

792
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
if you're from another area you know on

793
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
the planet right it's for people asking

794
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
about it

795
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,679
all right so we talked about the olive

796
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,159
leaf that's something

797
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,799
that is really important right now the

798
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,919
zinc shock therapy so that's two dropper

799
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,039
fulls every three hours two days three

800
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,399
days and check it out medical medium um

801
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,159
information right there i got the

802
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,720
licorice got the lemon balm i talked

803
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,039
about b12 is a great one too

804
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,880
because what happens is when when we're

805
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,520
exposed to critters that knock us down

806
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
and then we're just beaten down from it

807
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,960
right

808
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,720
you need something to support the

809
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
central nervous system something to help

810
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,520
the central nervous system reboot back

811
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,200
up because that fatigue people get when

812
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,760
they get hit by that storm

813
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,880
they get that fatigue and it's like it's

814
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,559
critical that that you get b12 into the

815
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,360
central nervous system because the b12

816
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,960
just gets knocked right out of people

817
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,240
so when you're up against stuff and you

818
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,159
start getting that

819
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,640
and everything in it and all that with

820
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,640
it your immune system

821
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,320
it takes a beating but your nervous

822
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
system takes a beating too your whole

823
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
your whole system gets kind of beaten

824
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,600
down dr phonemd good good to see you

825
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,960
so there you go

826
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,520
so we're talking about that that's a

827
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,760
vitamin d3 right there

828
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,360
so that's a really high quality d3 so

829
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,720
what i'm gonna do is put some drops in

830
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,320
the shot glass

831
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
right here

832
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,559
so

833
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,600
one two three four five six seven eight

834
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,279
nine 10. drop 10 in there

835
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,320
that's the d3 from the energy right

836
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,320
there

837
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,399
i know that everybody's vitamin d crazy

838
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,399
but like d crazy d d d d d d d

839
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,799
you know and everybody's always asking

840
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,039
about d that's that's the one i use

841
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,760
right there

842
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,440
you'll notice that

843
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
that is definitely

844
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,320
a supreme product right

845
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,320
so that's my shot glass

846
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,559
so let's make some time water really

847
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,080
quick so

848
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,080
grab this

849
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,559
put a little time in here

850
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,799
if you can't get a supplement for some

851
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,640
reason because you just can't get one

852
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,559
or you can't get a really good quality

853
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,399
one so you're using a less quality one

854
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,399
and you the less quality one you can't

855
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,360
guarantee is like giving you what you

856
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,039
need

857
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
i mean you can just go to the store get

858
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,159
some time if you don't grow your own

859
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,520

860
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,600
just get some put a bunch in like this

862
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,880
i drink time water every day right now

863
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,200
look at that and you could put more in

there you can make it really strong you

865
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,480
can just put some

866
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,159
some sprigs and you let it sit overnight

867
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
in the fridge you can just let it sit

868
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,200

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,360
do

933
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,880
steep for 10 to 15 minutes and then

934
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,480
strain

935
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,360
you can do that steep for 10 15 minutes

936
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,720
and then strain you can add some lemon

937
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,240

really want

940
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,000
but there you go

right now

943
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,079
you can steep it longer than 10 to 15

944
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,720
minutes but you want the minimum 10

945
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,280
15 minutes is the minimum that's what

946
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,040
you want so that's important so this is

947
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,399
incredible for what we're up against

948
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
right now today

949
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,320
okay

950
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,919

shock therapy which is two dropper holes

955
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,839

those intense antioxidants all those

962
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,280
intense strong antioxidants right

963
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,839
this is a really

964
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,680
important one too i do work with weimans

965
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,400
though so i'm just going to give you let

966
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,000
you know i work with weimans reason why

967
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,160
i work with wyman's

968
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,079
on this is because this is an entirely

969
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,000
different thing all in its own that i

970
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,119
don't want to disappear i don't want

971
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,720
this to disappear someday they pick the

972
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,400
wild blueberry

973
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,440
out of the field the wild blueberry okay

974
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,240
which cannot be killed nothing can kill

975
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,560
the wild blueberry plant because of its

976
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,400
strength so for thousands and thousands

977
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,200
of years

978
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,520
right it has adapted and it can handle

979
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,520
fire and then grow back

980
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,960
and you see what people don't realize is

981
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,599
that when fires go through forests

982
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,640
nothing grows back unless a bird or a

983
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,000
squirrel goes on to the property onto

984
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,240
the land and then poops a seed

985
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
so when a when a when a

986
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,760
bird is flying by

987
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
and goes the bathroom

988
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,000
and drops seeds down on that land that's

989
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,680
the only time you can get things to

990
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,079
start growing back when you've had

991
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,079
wildfires because wildfires when they

992
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,359
burn everything to the ground like

993
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,599
really burn everything to the ground

994
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,720
nothing will grow back

995
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,680
so you have to have a squirrel bring a

996
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,839
nut to plant a new tree right well the

997
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,920
wild blueberry plant

998
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,240
is the only plant on the planet where

999
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,880
you can wipe you can burn it to the

1000
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,880
ground i'm talking we're talking flame

1001
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
like no one's ever seen

1002
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,880
like just burn it to the ground a

1003
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,560
wildfire anything like that right you

1004
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,760
can torch it to the ground and it'll

1005
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,800
grow back up it'll grow back up fast

1006
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,359
so

1007
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,839
its roots are that strong and it just

1008
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,200
doesn't get killed off and and so that's

1009
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,119
one reason why just you know wild

1010
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,480
blueberry is just an amazing species all

1011
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,119
on its own

1012
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,160
but i can't like i can't say enough

1013
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,760
about

1014
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,280
like wild blueberry juice so i work with

1015
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,320
wyman's

1016
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,040
because

1017
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,839
for them to pick the wild blueberry

1018
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,760
and press it

1019
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,800
so it's not like when you go to the

1020
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
store

1021
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,040
and you see that hpp stuff or whatever

1022
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,640
that's different that hpp stuff that's

1023
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,520
not like this is actually they take the

1024
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,680
wild blueberry and they press

1025
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
those wild blueberries and you get

1026
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,320
something that's like

1027
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,400
this is this supersedes wine

1028
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,680
supersedes wine all together right so i

1029
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,839
don't know if you guys are doing your

1030
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,680
shot glasses of this but the antioch

1031
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,440
anthocyanin levels are something that no

1032
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,040
one's ever you can't even touch that

1033
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,040
with wild blueberry it's incredible

1034
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,640
that's a tonic right

1035
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,839
lauren brown

1036
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,640
i thought you said no lemon in hot water

1037
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,359
so

1038
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,640
lemon for tea is great can do it anytime

1039
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,079
you want

1040
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,839
it's not going to flush your liver

1041
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,599
or

1042
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,480
flush your body

1043
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,359
when it's used for tea and hot water

1044
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,640
okay

1045
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,760
but lemon

1046
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,079
in 32 ounces of water or 16 ounces of

1047
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,760
water or even 8 ounces of water just

1048
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,079
even lemon

1049
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,920
in water that's not hot

1050
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,760
will then stay active and flush poisons

1051
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,359
and toxins out of your liver and out of

1052
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,599
your body

1053
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,839
see so if you want to do the lemon water

1054
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,040
to

1055
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,800
flush poisons and toxins out of the

1056
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,760
liver in the body then you have to make

1057
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,920
sure it's not in hot hot water

1058
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,119
or hot water you got to make sure it's

1059
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,040
in

1060
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,599
regular water like room temperature

1061
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,240
water or cold water is fine or just

1062
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,240
lukewarm water or something but you

1063
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,000
don't want want it in hot water when you

1064
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,119
put it in tea it's different so you can

1065
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,640
do it medicinally in tea

1066
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,960
and you get other

1067
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,560
medicine out of your lemon when you have

1068
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,400
it in hot water but that's not the same

1069
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,400
thing you can't flush your liver then

1070
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,640
you want to flush your liver you have to

1071
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,599
have the 32 ounces of lemon water with

1072
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,640
the lemon juice not in hot water

1073
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,920
medical medium information

1074
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,200
where do you buy the wild blueberry

1075
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,200
juice shop s-h-o-p

1076
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
dot

1077
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,320
weimanns.com so wyman's is

1078
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,320
w-y-m-a-n-s-shop.wymans.com

1079
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
so that's the blueberry juice right

1080
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,320
so i just took a shot of it i'm going to

1081
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,560
take another shot of it

1082
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,800
i've been doing so much today that i

1083
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,040
really haven't

1084
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,280
had much too much of anything i had some

1085
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,520
celery juice this morning though

1086
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,480
tammy but doesn't lemon warm up when you

1087
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,480
put it in your body

1088
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,119
well the temperature that comes out of

1089
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,119
the kettle

1090
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,960
is really hot

1091
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,200
and if your blood was that hot

1092
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
you wouldn't be here right now so you

1093
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,680
can't have your blood

1094
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,599
the temperature of your body

1095
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,599
right

1096
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,359
cannot

1097
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,880
cannot be as hot

1098
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,400
as the water

1099
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,240
in the kettle

1100
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,400
the water in the kettle

1101
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,520
is

1102
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:11,440
120 30 40 60 180 degrees

1103
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,920
and that's what that is right

1104
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,000
so you got to be really careful right if

1105
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,680
you're meaning in the sense

1106
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,560
heather says it's the cognitive

1107
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,720
dissonance anthony once you say one word

1108
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,720
some someone will get triggered and go

1109
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,720
blank

1110
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,800
well

1111
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,880
look it's when it comes down when

1112
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,880
when it comes down to it though so this

1113
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,040
is important to know

1114
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,960
is that yeah i mean it's true i mean

1115
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,400
yeah i totally understand when it comes

1116
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,760
down to it with the hot water in the

1117
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,560
body and stuff your temperature is

1118
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,280
98.5

1119
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,000
97.4

1120
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,599
97.8

1121
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,400
98.6

1122
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:56,160
98.7

1123
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,920
so everybody's body temps run at

1124
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,319
different temperatures right

1125
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,000
a lot of people run like i run a really

1126
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,000
low body temp

1127
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,240
and a lot of people run a higher body

1128
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,560
temp they'll be like 98.6

1129
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,440
they'll be like 98.7

1130
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,160
right they'll run a higher body temp

1131
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,440
but that's that can't hurt

1132
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,000
any it can't hurt lemon going in you

1133
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,440
because that's not a 130

1134
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,520
degrees

1135
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,560
120 degrees

1136
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,720
or if you here's the problem if you cook

1137
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,040
your lemon so say your water comes out

1138
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,640
of that kettle at a buck 40

1139
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,319
and you put your lemon in there you just

1140
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,480
killed your lemon juice

1141
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,839
and then the water cools down and you

1142
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,640
think well now the water's cool enough

1143
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,319
for me to drink no the lemon won't flush

1144
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,960
because it's been killed off in there

1145
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,800
with the high temperature it had so

1146
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
but you want to flush out your liver you

1147
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,280
want to flush out your blood you want to

1148
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,800
flush everything out you need that lemon

1149
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,520
water being like it is and that's

1150
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,200
another system builder right there

1151
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,720
the reason why you see oranges here and

1152
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,560
you see lemons in here because we're

1153
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,800
talking about system builders so what i

1154
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,160
like doing is making some fresh squeezed

1155
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,839
orange juice that's what i like to do

1156
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,520
lemon and tea

1157
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,760
some abilities of the lemon survive

1158
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,960
but not the flushing

1159
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,720
and poison remover ability

1160
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,240
so the flushing and poison remover

1161
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,240
ability right

1162
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,480
inside your liver that's not going to

1163
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,599
make it if your lemon juice gets hot

1164
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,040
that's not going to float you're not

1165
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,400
going to flush out the intestinal tract

1166
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,160
or the liver

1167
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,280
it can't happen so you're not going to

1168
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,760
be able to do that liver flush

1169
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,400
that intestinal tract flush poisons and

1170
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,440
toxins your kidney flush

1171
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,839
you're not going to be able to do your

1172
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,319
kidney flush if the lemon get got too

1173
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,480
hot so if your lemon is in your tea

1174
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,240
you can't do your kidney flush

1175
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,200
and your liver flush and your intestinal

1176
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,640
flush

1177
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,200
but there's going to be still medicinal

1178
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,640
chemical compounds in there that are

1179
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,160
going to help you when you're doing it

1180
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,800
in your tea

1181
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,480
that's the difference

1182
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,480
so it's important to know

1183
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,079
so let's go let's keep on moving on a

1184
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,560
couple more things let's cut some aloe

1185
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,760
too what i do is aloe every day during

1186
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,319
this

1187
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,160
time of year especially

1188
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,160
so medical medium information

1189
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,960
there's some aloe right

1190
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,800
there right it talks about aloe a lot

1191
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,119
that's a great system builder right

1192
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,040
there for what's happening for people

1193
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,560
so what i do is i cut this just like

1194
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,800
that i didn't cut all the way through

1195
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,240
i cut that part so i ran the knife like

1196
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,880
this

1197
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,880
just like this

1198
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,359
and then you can open it like that

1199
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,720
now you can do it any way you want you

1200
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,800
can take a spoon in there you can do it

1201
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,440
that way i take the knife

1202
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,319
and i kind of fillet

1203
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,960
that top off of there right

1204
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,160
there we go i'm going to open it up

1205
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,640
you guys see that you guys see that on

1206
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,640
telegram

1207
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,599
okay and then i take the knife

1208
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,520
and i fillet

1209
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,599
that part out right there

1210
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,920
and you can take this

1211
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,920
now

1212
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,720
this is incredible right now

1213
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,720
as far as for a protection method

1214
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,200
something that should be added in you

1215
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,920
might be somebody that only

1216
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,440
has you know access to aloe

1217
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,319
like this fresh outlook but you don't

1218
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,640
have access to time or access to an

1219
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,359
orange or access to lemons right now or

1220
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,480
access to these incredible supplements

1221
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,640
and so

1222
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,800
eating it like that is great really

1223
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,040
incredible for you

1224
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,960
so that's another option so we talked

1225
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,760
about the micro c that's a big one right

1226
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,440
there

1227
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,920
olive leaf that's incredible for now

1228
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,680
what people are going through right

1229
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,760
you got the d3 for the people that love

1230
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,359
the d3 and want the d3 got the lemon

1231
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,359
balm that's the tender one i talked

1232
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,760
about you got the zing shark therapy you

1233
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,240
got the cat's claw

1234
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,160
and then goldenseal is a big one right

1235
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,319
now i'm just looking for the golden seal

1236
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,839
like for some reason can't find it

1237
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,480
but goldenseal

1238
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,720
that's a big deal

1239
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,720
and

1240
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,160
i'll actually get a golden seal in a

1241
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,520
moment too

1242
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,359
what i love about the golden seal is

1243
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,640
it's one of the most important things we

1244
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,640
can do right now too at this time

1245
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,920
i freeze chunks so you freeze aloe

1246
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,400
chunks or frozen chunks the only thing

1247
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,040
that you got to make sure if you if you

1248
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,359
buy the frozen chunks of aloe

1249
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,480
at the store or at the market

1250
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,560
make sure

1251
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,839
it's not laced

1252
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,200
look at the package look at the

1253
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
ingredient

1254
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,800
list

1255
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,800
check it all out

1256
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,960
okay that's important right there

1257
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,599
because make sure there's no citric acid

1258
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,520
in there that's important citric acid

1259
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
any kind of natural flavors any kind of

1260
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,359
weird fillers any kind of other

1261
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,079
chemicals any of that like make sure

1262
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,079
that's not there

1263
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,319
so here's the golden seal so i'm going

1264
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,319

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,960
some people i haven't talked to in a

1270
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,720
year two years some people haven't

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,960
talked to some family members i haven't

1272
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,200

1319
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,680
them on it for like a month

1320
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,200
now i got some friends on it for like a

1321
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,160
month and then they can take a week off

1322
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,559
sure

1323
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,040
but you can do the on and off

1324
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,359
right but you can also stay on it for a

1325
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,480
while too and stay on it for a while i

1326
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,520
mean ask your doctor what's right for

1327
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,960
you but i'm just telling you what i

1328
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,160
offer my friends and family like what i

1329
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,920
would do is i would stay on it if i had

1330
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,480
if i had something really going on that

1331
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,200
was tugging on me and tugging on me

1332
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,960
strong right

1333
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,559
so yeah

1334
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,000
so celery juice is a great one right

1335
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,079
there you guys can use that for your

1336
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,640
immune system

1337
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,520
celery juice could bring that in

1338
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,200
strengthen the body

1339
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,839
that's something too that

1340
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,839
every day

1341
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,319
so

1342
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,839
now what i also do is the barley grass

1343
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,880
juice powder

1344
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,559
i do the spirulina that's what i do too

1345
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,800
so i do the barley grass juice powder

1346
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:08,960
and the spirulina

1347
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,960
so what i do is a teaspoon of each one

1348
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:15,520
right there i'll mix it up with coconut

1349
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,520
water that's something i do or i'll take

1350
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,960
i'll take a little plastic bag i'll put

1351
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,359
a few scoops of

1352
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,480
of this in each in a plastic bag like a

1353
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:26,720
little a little zippy bag and i'll take

1354
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,240
that when i'm traveling and so i can go

1355
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,680
in there and i could take it and put it

1356
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
in some coconut water i can go buy a

1357
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,559
coconut water somewhere where i'm

1358
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,079

00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,920
