00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,960
yesterday that

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,720
i haven't talked in depth about before

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,800
and it's the mind control that metals do

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,720
when they're in the brain when someone's

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,239
severely depressed

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,559
it changes and shapes their life

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
when they're severely depressed because

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,200
from an unknown origin of depression not

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,960
just because they had a great loss or

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,559
something tragic happened and they're

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
depressed because of that or they're

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,520
suffering from depression

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,280
from you know maybe maybe a relationship

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,879
breakup or anything like that that's

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,079
different those things happen in life we

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559
know that right

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,760
and then we know why that depression is

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,719
connected right

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,640
but what about the millions and millions

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
hundreds of millions of people on planet

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
earth

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
that are suffering from sadness that's

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
unexplained depression that's

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,119
unexplained

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,799
mega depression the kind where they

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,840
can't function can't do anything can't

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,400
get out of bed

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,400
can't make decisions can't can't get

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
empowered can't just move forward in

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,200
their life right

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,000
and that depression is because of those

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,040
toxic heavy metals inside the brain

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and what that means right there those

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
metals do a lot when they give us our

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,759
symptoms and our conditions when they

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,759
give us that social anxiety when they

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
give us that nervousness

46
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,680
when we're sweating for no reason but we

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
just think it's because we're a nervous

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
type

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
you know you're a nervous type you know

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,640
that's why you're sweating

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
that's why your palms are soaking wet

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
and your your pits are drenched and

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
just going up to talk to somebody and

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,600
you're sweating and you're nervous about

55
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
anything

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,040
and you're getting you're even tremoring

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
with it that nervousness that's from

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
metals

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,920
that's what that is it's not that you're

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,040
someone that's a super nervous type

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,840
no the metals actually shape who we

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,319
are in so many ways and that's what

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,520
metals do metals cause adhd

64
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,720
they cause brain fog they cause autism

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,800
they shape who we are in many ways

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,480
and no one wants to talk about it no one

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
ever wants to know about it that's just

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,440
the way it works conventional medicine

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,879

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,319

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
in the mercury industry is one of the

192
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
most powerful industries probably in the

193
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
world that makes

194
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,319
the caffeine industry look like a joke

195
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
really and the caffeine industry is a

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,199
powerhouse because

197
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,520
they're also in the mind control

198
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,120
business too caffeine industry

199
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
the job of the caffeine industry is to

200
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
make sure that mommy's in every

201
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
and every baby on the planet gets

202
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,360
addicted to caffeine that's the caffeine

203
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,360
industry's role

204
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,120
and caffeine industries role is to make

205
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
sure that big pharma uses caffeine in

206
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,160
every drug and they do by the way

207
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,680
they just don't list it in ninety

208
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
percent of the drugs but caffeine's in

209
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
every single drug that big pharma does

210
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
right

211
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,960
so the mind controls the caffeine

212
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,160
industry but the mercury

213
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
industry is the quiet evil large

214
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,720
industry

215
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
powerful industry that if you got to

216
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
think about a a silo a rice to a grain

217
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
of rice

218
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
right the caffeine industry and big

219
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
pharma

220
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,800
is like this this tiny little grain

221
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,919
of rice the mercury man in the mercury

222
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,440
industry

223
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,039
is this silo of rice that's the size

224
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,720
it's like it's like the richest people

225
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,520
in the world you you'll see the richest

226
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
people in the world

227
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,599
publicly right you'll think oh whoa hey

228
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
wait a minute let me just look this up

229
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
forbes or

230
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
let me just look up the richest person

231
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,919
in the world is this no

232
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,360
it's not the richest people in the world

233
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,880
aren't listed

234
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,319
they're trillionaires not billionaires

235
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,199
the richest people in the world that

236
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,880
control the world are trillionaires

237
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
so it's important to know the difference

238
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,639
right and that's the illumination

239
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,840
they're the trillionaires and then euro

240
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,000
and then when you're a billionaire right

241
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,840
you're the top billionaire you're just

242
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,479
kind of like a public

243
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,400
you know you're just like that public uh

244
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
facade for others like oh that's the

245
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,720
richest person in the world no it's not

246
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
it's no it's not there's richer people

247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
in the world that controlled world war

248
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,919
ii they're trillionaires now they

249
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
controlled world war

250
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
one and they're they were grandfathered

251
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,120
in they controlled world war

252
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
ii they controlled the wars they control

253
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,160
everything they're the they're the

254
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,440
richest people in the world they're

255
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
trillionaires right

256
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
you don't hear about them because you

257
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
won't and they're the ones that pull

258
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
strings you know and the mercury man is

259
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,080
in that

260
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
category it's not in the caffeine

261
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
caffeines

262
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,240
a mind control big industry right but

263
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,880
the mercury industry is oh my god

264
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
you couldn't even imagine what that is

265
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
that's a difference so

266
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,159
and that mercury industry is in

267
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,560

saying

296
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
how dare i say that ocd is caused by

297
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,000
toxic heavy metals how dare i and

298
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
they're just coming by the thousands you

299
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,240

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,279
thousands literally in three days time

301
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
eight or ten thousand uh ocd trolls you

302
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,680
don't know ocd

303
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,399
uh i'm dr so-and-so i'm nutritionist

304
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,399
so-and-so

305
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,600
i've got ocd and you don't even know

306
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,240
it's not metals

307
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
and it's like oh my god ocd's caused by

308
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,160
metals

309
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
that's what it's caused by it is always

310
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,079
will be

311
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,120
it was it is now it's always going to be

312
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,880
and so it's these metals

313
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,519
i remember talking to somebody many

314
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,200
years ago right who had ocd really bad

315
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,560
really bad there's different kinds of

316
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,760
ocd and there's different levels of ocd

317
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,240
right so and one person that

318
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,320
their ocd was was was their head even

319
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,240
connected to their body

320
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
so she believed her head wasn't

321
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
connected to her body she would have to

322
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
be

323
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,920
she'd have to be in front of a mirror

324
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
all the time and then that ocd would

325
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,680
calm down when she'd see her head on top

326
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
of her body in the mirror

327
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
and then she would be away from there

328
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,560
for a little while trying to function

329
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,519
and then the ocd would kick up ocd would

330
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,959
kick up and all of a sudden

331
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,200
because you'd have to go and find the

332
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,640
mirror again to make sure her head was

333
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
attached to her body

334
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,720
that was that kind of ocd there's people

335
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,640
that i've known somebody that was

336
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
that would drive to work and they would

337
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,079
just hit a pothole in the in the road

338
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
and then they're worried they ran over

339
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
somebody or something so they'd have to

340
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,360
go

341
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,880
all the way around and they would be

342
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
late for work because they'd have to go

343
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
all the way around and drive down the

344
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
road to make sure they didn't hit

345
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
something and that something isn't still

346
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,440
on the road and they'd go back around

347
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,880
and back around and back around

348
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
and they'd be an hour late for work

349
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,839
every morning and then get fired

350
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,480
excessive compulsive disorder is real

351
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,680
and i mean i've seen it all in the 35

352
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
years and then the thoughts

353
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
thoughts are another thing too

354
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,959
repetitive thoughts and the thoughts and

355
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,959
thoughts and nothing can soothe it and

356
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,760
not just the thoughts but the taking

357
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,000
action

358
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,760
that's when ocd gets really really bad

359
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,880
not just the thoughts but the action

360
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,399
taking right

361
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,839
like did i close your refrigerator did i

362
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
close it it closed well i can't sleep

363
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
it's four o'clock in the morning because

364
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,200
i've just checked 57 times

365
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
from the time i went to bed at 10 a 10

366
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
10 at 10 p.m at night

367
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,079
and the thoughts of going to die like

368
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,920
you know am i gonna die or if i say

369
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,440

370
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
and it's something bad gonna happen and

371
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
it and goes on and on that's mercury

372
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,600
that's the mercury man the mercury man

373
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,760
has

374
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,480
tremendous power over mind control

how do what metals what are you talking

423
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,440
about metals

424
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,199
16 to 32 ounces of lemon water hydrate

425
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,720
in the morning what happens is hydration

426
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,199
is important because how do you get

427
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,880
anything out of the body that's toxic

428
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,880
how do you get anything out of the body

429
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,000
that's toxic

430
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,519
when you're not hydrated

431
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,519
16 to 32 ounces of lemon water not hot

432
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,120
not hot water right

433
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
medical medium information started the

434
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,880
whole flushing the liver with

435
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,279
lemon water that's original information

436
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
from medical medium right

437
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
and then all of a sudden years later

438
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
years later i do the lemon in hot water

439
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,360
because someone

440
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,320
you know you know someone shifted gears

441
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,240
out there and

442
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
the trending world and we're like oh

443
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,680
okay let's let's

444
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
ruin something that originally that

445
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
originally comes from medical medium

446
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
spirit of compassion let's destroy it

447
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
and let's make sure now it's hot water

448
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,839
so no one benefits from it

449
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,440
the details matter it matters okay

450
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
and it's not eight to twelve ounces of

451
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
lemon water some people do a cup of

452
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,639
lemon water and make sure it's hot and

453
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,160
they got their lemon in there ah they

454
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,040
did it okay this is great

455
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,120
no in order to flush the liver in order

456
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,279
to flush the liver and body of toxins

457
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,720
has to be lemon water that hasn't been

458
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,560
killed off

459
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:12,320
it has to be raw not cooked lemon

460
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,680
raw lemon details matter

461
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,720
and it's that raw lemon and the 16 to 32

462
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,600
ounces of water

463
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,320
that makes the wheels go around okay

464
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,320
really important

465
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,639
we're going to cover that i'm going to

466
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,920
cover lots of stuff so we got the 16 32

467
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,000
ounces of lemon water

468
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,759
that's the first thing an empty stomach

469
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
so let's head into

470
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,120
running some celery through if you guys

471
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,639
just came on here we're talking about

472
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,680
mind control we're talking about the

473
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,759
mercury man

474
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
we're talking about things like ocd talk

475
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
about tourette's too we'll talk about

476
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
all the different stuff depression

477
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,519
anxiety we're going to talk about how

478
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,800
metals work in the brain

479
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,639
how how metal interacts with electricity

480
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,440
so that's important to know all on its

481
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,959
own

482
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
we're going to talk about how the five

483
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
ingredients work in the heavy metal

484
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,440
detox smoothie and the heavy metal detox

485
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,920
cleanse that

486
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,519
that makes it all happen we're gonna

487
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,399
talk about that how cool

488
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,360
how cool i'm excited i'm gonna do a

489
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,279
little quick

490
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,959
uh celery run you guys don't mind

491
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
because this is the second part of the

492
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
cleanse get some celery juice going

493
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,160
right

494
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,160
looking around okay

495
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,759
here we are

496
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,480
get a little celery juice now celery

497
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,920
juice is critical because

498
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,560
this is a complete electrolyte

499
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,000
what that means a complete electrolyte

500
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,000
just so you guys know

501
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
is it means it goes to the brain

502
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:51,839
every single part of the brain

503
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,839
neurotransmitter clio cells neurons

504
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,920
left hemisphere right hemisphere

505
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,600
complete electrolyte doesn't get stopped

506
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:08,720
we eat food and we drink drink

507
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,760
to get an electrolyte somewhere

508
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,439
in our body functioning working getting

509
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,520
it to our nervous system and brain

510
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,720
that's why we eat it's part of why we

511
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,000
eat we're

512
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,240
gathering electrolytes celery juice is a

513
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,600
complete electrolyte

514
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,199
it helps dislodge metals it's not a

515
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,760
metal remover

516
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,799
but it will flush metals out that have

517
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,480
been removed

518
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
by like say the heavy metal detox

519
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,480
smoothie

520
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,480
but what the celery does

521
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,520
is it helps to loosen metals

522
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:49,200
so they pop out easier

523
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,570
mercury lead aluminum cadmium

524
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,080
nickel arsenic calcium

525
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,600
[Music]

526
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,039
toxic calcium which is a

527
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,120
toxic heavy metal

528
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,679
interesting right that's interesting

529
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,360
medical medium information classified

530
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,720
aluminum as being a heavy metal

531
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,720
you guys just so you know

532
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,880
science doesn't believe aluminum is a

533
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
heavy metal they'll say it's a light

534
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,679
metal so

535
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,160
medical medium you're so wrong you you

536
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:27,200
included aluminum in there

537
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,400
classification of a toxic heavy metal

538
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,000
is the damage it does neurotoxically

539
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,440
to the brain or the damage it does

540
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,720
to the body that constitutes a toxic

541
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,840
heavy metal a reclassified aluminum

542
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,400
purposely i did it years ago

543
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,559
because does this make sense to you well

544
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,000
aluminum is not a toxic heavy metal it's

545
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
not a heavy metal it's a light metal so

546
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,360
we shouldn't worry about it

547
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
let's make sure we get lots of aluminum

548
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
in our brains and body let's make sure

549
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,799
aluminum

550
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,640
does that make aluminum safe to you no

551
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,679
we have to classify it as a heavy metal

552
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
we have no choice

553
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
or no one's going to take aluminum

554
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
series when it's actually a dangerous

555
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,200
metal

556
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:14,559
i just bought your book from amazon

557
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919

585
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
waste

586
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,640
[Applause]

587
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,320
[Music]

588
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,080
i mean you if you sometimes you can't

589
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,960
help people if you want to help them i

590
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,240
mean you can do it i mean

591
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,760
there's just so much in the way right

592
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,960
so much in the way renata says

593
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,159
renatabanada says aw is it okay to chop

594
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
and trim my celery stalks before i put

595
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,480
them

596
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,159
in a bowl of with warm water

597
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,520
and do so i i would probably i wouldn't

598
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,159
chop them if you're gonna do i would

599
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,320
probably give them

600
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
you know what i would wash them whole

601
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,880
first

602
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,799
and get some of the dirt out heavier

603
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,400
stuff out or anything any kind of dirt

604
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
around and dirt in the inside stocks

605
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,919
right i'd probably

606
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,799
wash that out a little bit first before

607
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
i chopped

608
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,480
and and did you know i'd do the little

609
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
dish soap in that point right

610
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,320
natural dips dish up a little bit in the

611
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
bowl in the whole form at least for a

612
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,120
little bit and then chop it after and

613
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,400
give it another rinse if you wanted to

614
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,559
the reason why i don't like to chop it

615
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
up in pieces and small pieces

616
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,720
you chop it up in small pieces and put

617
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
in a bowl you're losing celery juice in

618
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,600
between all those chops

619
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,520
and it's in there and you're kind of

620
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,919
like it's kind of like bleeding out you

621
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,960
know

622
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,840
it's kind of like bleeding out

623
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,120
all right can we do a i see another

624
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
question i want to answer questions to

625
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,919
you guys i don't want to just talk over

626
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
you guys

627
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,039
susan says can we do this on a budget

628
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,559
watching the amount of celery you are

629
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,120
using and adding

630
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,440
up the money does it have to be organic

631
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,720
well first of all the juicer i used cuts

632
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,760
the celery bill in half

633
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,760
so that's the mm-900 hds it's an

634
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
investment right it's a it's a couple

635
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,960
hundred dollars or if it's on sale it's

636
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,480
200 and something dollars

637
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,240
but um but susan so the juicer i had

638
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,559
actually squeezes more juice out of the

639
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,520
celery so the pulp is really dry you get

640
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,799
more juice so

641
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,440
that alone can can cut the celery juice

642
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,200
bill down a lot so then eventually you

643
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
pay for the juicer by doing that and

644
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,520
then whatever in the whole bit it's

645
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,039
awesome

646
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,200
okay that's one two is um

647
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,880
yeah you can use conventional celery now

648
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,039
i get punished for that

649
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
i can't tell you how many lashings i get

650
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,640
right that's one of one of the areas i

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,720
get lashed really bad

652
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,039
is the whole conventional celery thing

653
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,000
so people do posts about me out there

654
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,159
they do posts

655
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
they do articles they try to rip me down

656
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,760
all the time it's just it's i guess it's

657
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,799
just 24 7 thing out there so one of the

658
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,080
ways they do it is

659
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,039
he likes conventional celery celery is

660
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,679
on the top

661
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,159
you know the top the top 12 or top 10

662
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
you know

663
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,280
most pesticide radiant crops they say

664
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,159
out there but what they don't realize

665
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,440
is that it's there isn't a top ten

666
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,880
pesticide

667
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,720
ridden crop there isn't top ten anything

668
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,480
conventional is practically spray the

669
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
amount it's a schedule of three times a

670
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
week

671
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,640
one of the most difficult things i run

672
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,000
into is how nobody knows anything about

673
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
farming that writes these things and

674
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,960
tries to attack people so

675
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,480
here you are you're trying to attack not

676
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
you but the people will try to attack me

677
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,000
and say he supports conventional

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
celery and and it's the the top spray

679
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,760
crop

680
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,640
no it's not there's only

681
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,240
all conventional crops of all foods

682
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,799
conventional foods

683
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,640
outside maybe a couple are sprayed on a

684
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
schedule of three times a week

685
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,840
that means broccoli that means

686
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
everything conventional everything

687
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,679
conventionally zucchini conventional

688
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,000
cucumber conventional tomato

689
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,600
they're sprayed three times a week it's

690
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,080
the schedule for all conventional crops

691
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,840
so they'll say they'll say hey you know

692
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,039
he supports conventional celery it's on

693
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,760
the top ten

694
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,960
there's no top ten they're all sprayed

695
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,960
three times a week

696
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,159
just like organic produce is sprayed

697
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
three times a week

698
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
an organic produce is sprayed with the

699
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,159
msg nicotine spray

700
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,720
right that's what they do so they use

701
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
the msg caffeine nicotine spray

702
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,520
and that's what's sprayed because those

703
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,679
are neuroantagonists so that's what's

704
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,080
sprayed on all the organic crops you got

705
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,840
to wash

706
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,200
both both for one both foods right

707
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,400
but the the whole thing is that celery

708
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,000
conventional celery

709
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,720
you got to wash it and yeah it outweighs

710
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,640
what residue is inside that celery when

711
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
it's conventional so definitely i

712
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
support you

713
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,600
if you do conventional celery a hundred

714
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,440
percent because that celery juice

715
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,279
is gonna be fixing things in you and

716
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,039
cleaning out things in you more so than

717
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,039
what's on that celery

718
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,559
it's going to be cleaning out and fixing

719
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
you and getting you better

720
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,080
that conventional celery i mean this is

721
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,960
just common sense stuff

722
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
really this information but it shows you

723
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,760
the alternative movement

724
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
nobody really knows anything about

725
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,400
anything and it's really sad

726
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,559

keep the lights on or whatever it is but

747
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,240
they got this thing priced so low and i

748
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,320
love it because i know that even though

749
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,840
it costs more to print it i just know

750
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,200
that people are getting an opportunity

751
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
to heal and i love that

752
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,760
love that so take advantage of that

753
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,400
price why they keep it there right now

754
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,520
so let me strain this you have to strain

755
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,679
your celery juice

756
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,760
and that's really important to know got

757
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,559
to strain it

758
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,559
let's do that

759
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,279
it's critical to keep any pull out

760
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,159
any leftover little fibers or

761
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,960
pulp you want out okay so that's

762
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,960
important to know

763
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
so that's your celery juice right there

764
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,520
your lemon water

765
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,240
hydrates you it helps flush

766
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,360
the toxins out in the morning flush the

767
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,919
liver and the body

768
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,600
the celery juice flushes the liver too

769
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,640
cleanses the body of toxins too

770
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,360
but also loosens up metals

771
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,240
it's a complete electrolyte that goes to

772
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,960
the brain

773
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:40,640
electrolytes get magnetically pulled

774
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,840
into your brain and brain stem

775
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,679
important though okay so if you're an

776
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,799
electrolyte and you're swimming around

777
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,840
and you're swimming around

778
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,240
and you're swimming around in the

779
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,640
bloodstream swimming around in the body

780
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,520
right swimming around in the blood-brain

781
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,960
barrier right

782
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,279
across the blood-brain barrier into the

783
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,679
spinal fluid if you're in electrolyte

784
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,960
and you're swimming around you

785
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
magnetically get

786
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,200
pulled up to the brain and get stuck

787
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,400
there electrolytes get sucked

788
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,159
into the brain they get sucked

789
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,799
into the brain so when a complete

790
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,480
electrolyte in celery juice gets into

791
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,399
the brain

792
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,320
it's an entirely different experience

793
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,520
than partial electrolytes that get

794
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,679
sucked into the brain

795
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,720
partial electrolytes complete

796
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,840
electrolyte

797
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,399
partial electrolytes okay just take

798
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,000
any herb or vegetable here's cilantro

799
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,279
which we're going to talk about that's a

800
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,600
partial electrolyte partial right

801
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,760
you take broccoli a partial whatever

802
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,600
vegetable you want is a partial

803
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,799
asparagus partial celery complete

804
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,799
complete complete

805
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,799
that's why it has the power to help

806
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,399
dislodge metals it's a complete

807
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,440
electrolyte

808
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,360
okay if you just got

809
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
on here okay just got on here with you

of it here's the book

817
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,760
really important to have this book right

818

it's fun it's fun all right

829
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
we did before we make the heavy metal

830
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,120
detox smoothie

831
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,799
let's talk about our topics a little bit

832
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,399
and let's cover the last couple

833
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,080
remaining things on celery juice don't

834
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,080
mix anything in it

835
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
don't don't add the water don't add the

836
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,799
lemon like i said earlier don't add

837
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,159
apple

838
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:57,120
you blow it you blow its power you blow

839
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,880
its power

840
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,880
it's why celery has to be in its herbal

841
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,120
form that's herbal medicine i used a

842
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,039
medical device which is a juicer

843
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,600
and i juiced it and that's herbal

844
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,399
medicine sitting right there you guys

845
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,799
if you chop up a celery stick and throw

846
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,000
it in

847
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,919
a tuna in a tuna sandwich or something

848
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,600
right or you're mixing tuna fish and

849
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,880
mayo and you throw some tiny little

850
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,440
celery bits

851
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,919
it's not going to work if you do crudis

852
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,679
hay

853
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,120
and you got a little dip of french onion

854
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,600
dip and you got a little this and some

855
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,640
ranch

856
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,720
whatever you're doing you got your

857
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,320
celery stick it's not gonna work if you

858
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
chop up celery and throw it in a salad

859
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,240
it's not gonna work

860
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,080
it's an it's an herbal extraction you're

861
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,919
creating from an actual herb and you're

862
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,399
trying to get a larger amount of its

863
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,760
juice

864
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,799
by itself extract it from

865
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,919
the pulp from its skeleton

866
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,159
okay it's important to know fiber in an

867
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,120
herb or vegetable is only to hold it up

868
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,480
so it can find

869
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,960
sun it's not packed with nutrients

870
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,159
sorry to say it's not packed with

871
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,360
nutrients

872
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,919
so the fiber the fiber in the stem

873
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,279
of cilantro just say for example because

874
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,480
i got cilantro here

875
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,240
the fiber and the stem of cilantro was

876
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,200
just to hold it up

877
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
to get it to the sun be like hey sun sun

878
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,399
hey

879
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,600
get in that shiny bright sun it's a

880
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,399
skeleton

881
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,520
we don't digest it it doesn't provide

882
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,159
nutrients

883
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,440
so when you juice something with a

884
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,440
really good juicer

885
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,080
you're extracting the nutrients and

886
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,320
leaving its skeleton behind

887
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,320
okay that's all and what you're doing

888
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,120
with an herbal extraction like celery

889
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,440
juice

890
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,520
you're doing just that you don't want

891
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
anything but the juice the herbal

892
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,360
extraction just like you're doing an

893
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,440
herbal tea of some kind and you're

894
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,159
trying to do that extraction

895
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,159
today's in for lots of information today

896
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,960
when you guys have you just came on here

897
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,480
get your notepads out get your pens lots

898
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,480
of info a lot of different stuff

899
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,600
it's day two the heavy metal detox

900
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,480
clench challenge

901
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,840
if someone's sensitive sensitive and

902
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,279
they're sensitive to celery juice a

903
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,039
little bit they're sensitive to whatever

904
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,200
this is really toxic

905
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,480
they're really toxic do smaller amounts

906
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
of everything smaller amounts of

907
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
everything it means they're really

908
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
really toxic

909
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,919
i could do four ounces of celery juice

910
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,360
six ounces eight ounces

911
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,960
four ounces of heavy metal detox

912
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,039
smoothie eight ounces

913
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,200
you'll work your way up a little bit of

914
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,720
spirulina maybe in some coconut water a

915
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
little bit of this maybe a little bit of

916
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,200
that i'll show you i'll show you

it's fun info all right i'm trying to

920
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,679
read comments at the same time

921
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,720
juggling i'm juggling i'm juggling all

922
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,840
right

923
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,679
let me throw a cap on this baby

924
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,679
because i might just knock it over and i

925
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,559
don't want to do that

926
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,519
all right before we make the heavy metal

927
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,960
detox smoothie let's talk about the

928
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,000
information

929
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,559
that information is critical linda says

930
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,960
what about the fiber and fruit

931
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,399
well the fiber's good was fiber's fine

932
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,679
that's the whole point

933
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,360
five are the pulp in fruit it's the pulp

934
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,720
in fruit

935
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,760
okay so fruits pulp more so than

936
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,159
fiber vegetables fiber

937
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,039
so that's the other thing too pulp and

938
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,399
fruit

939
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,440
pectin pulp fruit right

940
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,880
wild blueberry right here pectin and

941
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,159
pulp

942
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:34,640
we ms shrew is fiber

943
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:39,039
pectin pulp right it's fibrous

944
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:42,559
but not fiber right pectin pulp

945
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,840
fiber fiber

946
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,720
stems of the vegetable

947
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,880
anyway and fiber in the pectin pulp

948
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,000
which is fibrous and fruit holds the

949
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,640
fruit together

950
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,279
so you have a piece of fruit when you

951
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,320
when you

952
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,640
chomp on that fruit your body disregards

953
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,640
it

954
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,679
it disregards all the or or discards

955
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,480
all that pulp in any kind of fibrous

956
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,279
pulp

957
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,559
right it discards that you poop that out

958
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,880
in your toilet

959
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,840
but you it's your body extracted all the

960
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,159
nutrients

961
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,679
from all the juice and the cell and what

962
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,120
was in the cell structures

963
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,880
and then the fiber helps us go to

964
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,399
bathroom

965
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,679
when we have problems inside our guts

966
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,159
and we can't go to bathroom like

967
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,039
constipation issues inflammation right

968
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,880

anywhere else

1039
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,079
until someone takes it and doesn't cite

1040
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
it back to here which

1041
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,760
i saw today earlier which was really

1042
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
frustrating when i saw what happened

1043
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,680
today

1044
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,000
someone some influencer literally was

1045
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,240
like

1046
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,240
reading verbatim out of liver rescue and

1047
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,000
didn't cite medical medium

1048
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,520
nobody knew the liver did all these

1049
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,640
things blah blah blah but

1050
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,640
yet you know all right

1051
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,960
sluggish stagnant liver because fats

1052
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,400
burden the liver

1053
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
and pesticides and all these other

1054
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,920
chemicals and toxic stuff that gets

1055
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,760
inside the livers medical medium info

1056
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,599
viruses that get inside the liver making

1057
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
it sluggish and stagnant byproduct in

1058
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,760
the liver

1059
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,839
causing all these problems medical

1060
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,640
medium information it's amazing

1061
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,119
people can just take it and not say

1062
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,280
where it comes from

1063
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,760
mv doom i got so annoyed when i see

1064
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
people rip off mm info you then you must

1065
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,800
be like

1066
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,320

1067
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,320

1073
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,480
that people who you know care about like

1074
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,320

1077
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
disgusting really

1078
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,880
hurts people because they can't get back

1079
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,000
to where the infamous information is

1080
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,839
so metal and metal exposure

1081
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,440
is rampant right now so when you're

1082
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,880
doing the perfumes clones of scented

1083
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
candles and air fresheners

1084
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,200
that's metal that goes directly to the

1085
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,880
brain through the sinus passage

1086
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,240
i'm not talking about just in the lungs

1087
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
and it finds its way to the brain that

1088
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,760
way which it does too

1089
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,000
mouth too the mouth you smell perfume

1090
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,000
you're

1091
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,920
eating it it's landing on your mouth

1092
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,680
while you're talking to someone

1093
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,760
it's landing in your mouth it's coating

1094
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,359
your whole throat right down

1095
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,280
and you're swallowing that perfume

1096
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,760
you're eating that chemical company that

1097
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,920
chemical giant's perfume

1098
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,640
chemical companies create the

1099
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,040
ingredients for perfume to come together

1100
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,760
just think about that a little bit right

1101
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,920
this isn't a 10 an attack on perfume

1102
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,079
it's just a reality check of how much of

1103
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,240
it we got in us because i smell perfume

1104
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,800
you just walk outside you smell it's

1105
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,480
blowing off people on the street

1106
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,240
then you can just choke it down be like

1107
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,440
thanks for that pesticide spray i really

1108
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,160
needed that right now

1109
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,720
thanks for that thanks well that's great

1110
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,240
god

1111
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,560
i'm sure you're poisoning your children

1112
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,760
too at the same time not that they

1113
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,320
it's their fault it's not their fault

1114
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,359
because the industries they betray us

1115
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,160
because they're

1116
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,240
they don't let anybody know you know and

1117
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,640
that goes back to the heavy metal world

1118
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,920
the heavy metal world toxic heavy metal

1119
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,960
world is a really

1120
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,119
really silent industry

1121
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,800
it's in everything it's in nano sprays

1122
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
on everything it's in fungicide on

1123
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
clothing it's

1124
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
it's it's all over the place you guys

1125
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
it's not just aluminum foil that i

1126
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,720
showed you and open up every day

1127
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,200
it's everywhere okay and then it's in

1128
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,599
pharmaceuticals all the pharmaceuticals

1129
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,040
metal deposits interrupt electricity

1130
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,560
swimming around in your brain

1131
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,720
metals can make decisions for you

1132
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,079
and they can push you to make some

1133
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,079
pretty shitty decisions

1134
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,280
and and make you feel like a bad person

1135
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:18,480
in this at the same time

1136
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,000
confidence issues come from toxic heavy

1137
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,960
metals many times

1138
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,720
not all the time but a lot of the time

1139
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,839
confidence issues you guys

1140
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,480
comes from toxic heavy metals inside the

1141
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,000
brain

1142
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,960
confidence issues yeah

1143
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,960
metals really do shape the fabric of our

1144
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
lives

1145
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,680
i know and they control too they control

1146
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,280
us

1147
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,960
what happens is electricity swims

1148
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,920
through the brain and hits the deposits

1149
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,280
of toxic heavy metals and ricochets off

1150
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,119
that's how ocd occurs ocd occurs because

1151
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,200
there's a deposit of toxic heavy metal

1152
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,880
such as mercury sitting on a neuron

1153
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,880
an electrical impulse keeps on hitting

1154
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,119
it over and over again

1155
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,240
and bouncing back up and when it bounces

1156
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,119
back up

1157
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,480
another one's coming down another one's

1158
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,839
coming down

1159
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,839
so let's just pretend let's just pretend

1160
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,520
this pencil is a neuron

1161
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,960
okay just pretend this pencil is a

1162
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,119
neuron right

1163
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,319
and you got toxic heavy metals right in

1164
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,079
the middle

1165
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,839
let's just pretend it's in the middle

1166
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,200
okay so you got toxic but a little bit

1167
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,240
of mercury aluminum right in the middle

1168
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,160
of that pencil

1169
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,720
an electrical impulse is coming down

1170
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,480
that neuron with information

1171
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,079
and as it's coming down real fast i'm

1172
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,079
going real slow as it's coming down it

1173
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,520
hits the deposit

1174
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,240
and if the deposit's big enough it

1175
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,960
explodes and bounces back up as it's

1176
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,359
going back

1177
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,720
up another electrical impulse is coming

1178
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,000
up behind it

1179
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,800
and crashing into it that's where

1180
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,200
i better check is these lights go on

1181
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,920
these lights are on but i better

1182
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,920
nope nope i shut them off i know i shut

1183
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,599
those lights off

1184
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,200
um i better check i better check to make

1185
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,240
sure this lights are off yep they're off

1186
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,880
right

1187
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
yep they're on nope they're definitely

1188
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,880
off

1189
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,800
i'll check again let me see

1190
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,560
okay my anxiety's starting to rise now

1191
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
i'm trying to have an anxiety attack

1192
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,160
because i don't i know i shut those

1193
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560
lights off i know i shut those lights

1194
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,720
off

1195
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:30,720
i gotta look again god damn it oh

1196
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,119
yep all right oh

1197
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,720
my god now i'm having a panic attack

1198
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,119
because i did it four times

1199
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,880
already and i'm going to do it one more

1200
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,319
time

1201
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,520
yep i sit down i shut it off

1202
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,240
i've heard that a thousand times when i

1203
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,520
was practicing for 35 years

1204
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,880
that's just that variety of ocd

1205
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,040
that's a positive heavy metal

1206
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,200
sitting on a neuron an electrical

1207
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,960
impulse keeps on hitting it

1208
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
each electrical impulse keeps on hitting

1209
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,000
it and

1210
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
part of that electrical impulse gets

1211
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,560
ricocheted back

1212
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,720
that's what that is that's what that is

1213
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,319
that's you in the car ingrid see that's

1214
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,560
me in the car

1215
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,079
oh you poor thing oh god oh

1216
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,560
and here's the other thing that

1217
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,599
electrical impulse you guys

1218
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:25,280
is carrying information information is

1219
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,800
in that electrical impulse going down

1220
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,839
that neuron

1221
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,839
so cutting across that neuron is

1222
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,040
information

1223
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:38,319
and that information

1224
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,599
okay can blow up

1225
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,520
blow up right when that information in

1226
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,359
the electrical impulse hits that

1227
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
deposit of toxic heavy metal sitting

1228
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,960
inside the neuron

1229
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,680
it could blow up and mess your head up

1230
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,560
and now your foot you're frustrated

1231
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,839
you're you're

1232
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,480
flustered that's it you're confused

1233
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,240
you're

1234
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,880
you're off your game you're stressed out

1235
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,359
when you shouldn't be

1236
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,280
saskia why are there many different ocd

1237
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,480
mine is different i'll tell you why

1238
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,240
because there's many different toxic

1239
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,359
heavy metals and amounts in different

1240
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,040
places of the brain

1241
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,359
someone might have toxic heavy metals in

1242
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,760
the emotional center of the brain

1243
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,160
someone may have it in the frontal lobe

1244
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,160
someone may have it everywhere

1245
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,640
someone may have it sprinkled about the

1246
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,599
left hemisphere and then on the right

1247
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,880
hemisphere have

1248
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,640
larger deposits and someone may have

1249
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,400
more mercury and someone may have more

1250
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,920
lead and someone may have mercury and

1251
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,480
aluminum when someone has aluminum and

1252
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,920
copper

1253
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,400
someone may have a little bit of all of

1254
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,200
it someone may just have one r2

1255
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,839
mainly and lightly on the others it

1256
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,280
changes

1257
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:50,560
everything everything

1258
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,240
it's advanced information the info is

1259
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,839
amazing tick-tock honored

1260
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,000
thank you for being here and tick tock

1261
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,920
thank you spread the word

1262
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,359
say hey check out this cleansed heel

1263
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
book

1264
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,920
it's saving lives around the world

1265
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,079
and i think i'm going to turn that back

1266
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,079
on

1267
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,440
51 off amazon.com us make sure you check

1268
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,800
it out

1269
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,880
before we make the heavy metal detox

1270
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:22,240
smoothie let's cover a little bit more

1271
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,319
let's go

1272
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,680
how do the five ingredients work why is

1273
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,040
there five things in the heavy metal

1274
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,319
detox movie

1275
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,319
why is there because there's one more

1276
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,560
than one toxic heavy metal that's one

1277
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:38,160
thing right there all on its own

1278
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,800
right there's different depths of your

1279
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,440
toxic

1280
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,160
heavy metal you may have a toxic heavy

1281
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,119
metal

1282
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,240
deep in the core of your liver not just

1283
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,720
on the outside

1284
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,040
or adjacent lobe you may actually have

1285
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,200
toxic heavy metal very deep

1286
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,040
in the core of the liver you may have

1287
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,800
the metals in the lining of the

1288
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
intestinal tract i'm not talking about

1289
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,839
inside the intestinal tract i'm talking

1290
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,240
about in the lining itself

1291
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,200
smack dab in the middle of the lining

1292
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,119
you might have

1293
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,720
toxic heavy metals in the brain

1294
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,440
but in the brain stem a whole nother

1295
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,280
game

1296
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,119
when those metals in the brain stem and

1297
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,200
it brings them in flames

1298
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,240
whole another game right there on its

1299
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,359
own right

1300
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,800
susan i've been trying to figure out why

1301
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,960
i stress out when nothing is going on

1302
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,319
it just added more stress to my life

1303
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,079
trying to to find

1304
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,760
what was wrong with me absolutely and

1305
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,760
you know what

1306
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,560
it's it's it's a tricky situation too

1307
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,920
because then we're seeing the

1308
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,520
neurologists and then we're seeing our

1309
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
fifth doctor and our temp doctor and now

1310
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,960
we're seeing you know

1311
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,480
another nutritionist who's got the keto

1312
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,000
diet down they think and then you get

1313
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,599
and then now you're seeing an rd

1314
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,119
and now you're seeing a chiropractor

1315
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,119
right now you're seeing

1316
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,880
now you're back to a do and a naturopath

1317
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,880
and back to a specialist and a gp and

1318
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,240
now you're back to

1319
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,040
another neurologist and now you're at

1320
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,480
the pulmonologist's office too to boot

1321
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,400
absolutely and guess what

1322
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,119
the mercury man is laughing his ass off

1323
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,160
the mercury man laughing laughing

1324
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,319
laughing

1325
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,800
because the mercury man is grandfathered

1326
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,720
in with documents inside of a vault

1327
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,640
that originally stemmed from the mercury

1328
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,560
industry back over a thousand years ago

1329
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,880
and you can't touch those documents

1330
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,720
they're trusted in forever those

1331
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,960
documents will say

1332
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,480
mercury will never leave us our lives or

1333
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,880
the industries

1334
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,200
it will be there forever doesn't matter

1335
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,760
if the dentist stop putting in her teeth

1336
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,119
it's everywhere it's in medications it's

1337
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,720
all over the place

1338
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,119
that's the mercury man all right

1339
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,760
which reminds me here's one way the

1340
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,760
mercury man gets in us right there

1341
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
the mercury man gets in is through fish

1342
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,960
oil supplements

1343
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,079
methyl mercury methyl mercury

1344
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,280
traces the essence of mercury so it goes

1345
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,880
straight to our brain

1346
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,839
never do fish oil supplements eat fish

1347
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,319
you're better off i'm not i don't eat

1348
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,839
fish

1349
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,960
i don't eat fish they're filled with

1350
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:14,079
dioxins and metals right

1351
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,680
but the point is is you can eat fish

1352
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,359
and still do the heavy metal detox

1353
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,800
smoothie and cleanse and still

1354
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,079
heal you can still eat fish if you're a

1355
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,119
fish eater

1356
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,400
fish oil entirely different

1357
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,480
entirely different the mercury in a

1358
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,960
piece of fish is way different

1359
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,640
than when it's in this form right here

1360
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,200
that's the form it becomes methyl

1361
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,520
mercury

1362
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:42,559
that's the form that gets to your brain

1363
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,000
all right are we having any fun yet are

1364
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,079
you guys

1365
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,960
bummed out so no mercury in vimergy

1366
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,800
right

1367
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,000
vimergy does not add mercury to their

1368
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,000
supplements no

1369
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,160
all right let's move forward you guys

1370
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,960
um heavy metal detox ingredients let's

1371
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,720
go into that

1372
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:09,599
why is that important okay

1373
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,000
fish oil is different than dha keep that

1374
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,000
in mind

1375
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,839
say like a plant-based dha supplement or

1376
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,760
so forth

1377
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:23,359
entirely different fish oil is

1378
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,480
a billion heads and tails and fins

1379
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,319
of of millions and millions and millions

1380
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,480
of fish

1381
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,760
thrown into machines and pressed and

1382
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,160
squeezed down

1383
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,960
to create the fish oil for the fish oil

1384
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,240
industry

1385
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:40,880
right all right

1386
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,760
cilantro wild blueberries barley grass

1387
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,200
juice powder

1388
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,079
atlantic dolls right

1389
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,920
okay and spirulina you're looking at

1390
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,960
five things right here

1391
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,960
five things one two three four five if

1392
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,200
my ocd kicks in i'm gonna count it over

1393
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,240
and over again one two three four five

1394
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,240
one two three four five right so

1395
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,160
the whole point is is you're looking at

1396
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,599
five different things

1397
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,599
guess what you're not looking at

1398
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,240
guess what you're not looking at where

1399
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,559
is the bentonite clay

1400
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,520
bending my clay where are you been like

1401
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,359
clay

1402
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,440
where are you where's the charcoal

1403
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,720
charcoal that was in somebody else's

1404
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,359
brain scheme

1405
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,559
someone's big old brain scheme uh-huh

1406
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:30,640
where's the charcoal

1407
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:33,839
where are you zeolite

1408
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,359
zeolite why is zeolite not in here

1409
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,680
see why it's not in here uh-huh nope

1410
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,720
nope nope and we'll talk about that why

1411
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,040
these aren't in there

1412
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,760
see light's not in here garlic

1413
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,160
where's the garlic why is the garlic in

1414
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,160
here

1415
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,680
i mean i like garlic garlic's in recipes

1416
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,440
garlics and medical mean recipes but why

1417
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,960
is it in the heavy metal detox smoothie

1418
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,400
where is it okay

1419
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,240
and what else what else do people like

1420
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,480
to say remove metals what else do people

1421
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,480
come up with like takomini stuff

1422
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,559
that removes metals so let's go into it

1423
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,319
a little bit why aren't those things

1424
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,079
in here one is bentonite clay

1425
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,680
is really aggressive on the intestinal

1426
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,119
tract it doesn't remove toxic heavy

1427
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,079
metals instead it'll make crohn's

1428
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,559
colitis celiac ibs a hell of a lot worse

1429
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,000
it'll make uh intestinal problems a lot

1430
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,160
worse

1431
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,520
and it's damaging to the lining of the

1432
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,119
intestinal tract

1433
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,800
so bentonite clay is the last thing you

1434
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,720
want to ever take or consume no matter

1435
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,839
what never mind in a heavy metal detox

1436
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,920
whatever the heck

1437
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,119
that's one thing right there said to the

1438
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,680
next one charcoal

1439
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,480
charcoal suffocates your intestinal

1440
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,559
lining

1441
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,240
it stops nutrients from getting to your

1442
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,599
liver to get into your bloodstream to

1443
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,960
get into anywhere

1444
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,520
charcoal suffocates good bacteria

1445
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,960
good bacteria but yet helps bad bacteria

1446
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,240
thrive do you know why

1447
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,440
charcoal removes oxygen from your

1448
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,520
good bacteria bad bacteria

1449
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,200
thrives with no oxygen do you see how it

1450
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,200
works charcoal

1451
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,200
in your gut proliferates the bad

1452
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,480
bacteria making you sicker

1453
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,839
making bugs grow while killing your good

1454
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,119
bacteria because you build

1455
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:16,480
good bacteria thrives on oxygen

1456
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,000
bad bugs don't like oxygen

1457
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:23,119
because oxygen kills them charcoal

1458
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,400
makes you sicker that's why it's not in

1459
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,880
here

1460
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,079
that's just one reason you don't swallow

1461
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,839
charcoal you don't swallow it

1462
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,920
okay oh wait where's the chlorella

1463
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,440
chlorella where are you where are you

1464
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,119
chlorella where are you

1465
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,359
you're not in here either you're not

1466
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,200
part of the five

1467
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,640
chlorella doesn't remove toxic heavy

1468
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,079
metals and

1469
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,880
if it ever did it drops it along the way

1470
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,559
which makes you sicker chlorella is also

1471
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,920
filled with bacteria and has put a lot

1472
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,520
of people in the hospital

1473
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
it's not monitored it's not checked

1474
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,520
properly and chlorella

1475
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,000
tends to harbor bacteria because guess

1476
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,200
what

1477
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,440
bad bacteria thrives in chlorella why

1478
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,040
hmm why does bad bacteria thrive in

1479
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,160
chlorella

1480
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:16,240
spirulina's antibacterial

1481
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,240
bacteria doesn't thrive in spirulina

1482
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,040
i mean vimorgy independently tests their

1483
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,119
stuff for bacteria anyway

1484
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,680
but it doesn't thrive in in spirulina

1485
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,720
why does bad bacteria

1486
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,559
thrive in chlorella that means there's

1487
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,880
something in chlorella that feeds bad

1488
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,960
bacteria hmm

1489
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,400
so let's be another hack in the industry

1490
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,520
of alternative medicine you should be on

1491
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,079
chlorella

1492
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,839
i'm dr hack make sure you're on

1493
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,839
chlorella here's a chlorella supplement

1494
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:45,040
on dr hack oh heavy metals we only

1495
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,559
learned about that because of medical

1496
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,079
medium for 35 years

1497
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,520
so let's come up with our own little

1498
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,480
thoughts of what can take metals out

1499
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,480
here's some chlorella

1500
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,520
and then there's zeolite medical medium

1501
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,559
book one

1502
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,520
there's like a line in the book

1503
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,559
can you zeolite at the time there was

1504
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,119
one zeolite

1505
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,400
at the time i trusted enough that you

1506
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,040
can use for gut

1507
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,520
for the gut situation because there

1508
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,680
wasn't atlantic dulce available and i

1509
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,480
use atlantic dolls to remove toxic heavy

1510
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,480
metals from the gut

1511
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,680
so i mentioned that you could use

1512
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,880
a zeolite at the time but that

1513
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,119
ship has sailed not be not just because

1514
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,559
you can get atlantic dolls

1515
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,880
okay i never said zeolite can remove

1516
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,640
anything out of the body it was

1517
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,079
intestinal track if it was

1518
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,960
surface intestinal tract if it was

1519
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,319
surface

1520
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,800
in the gut health section of the book

1521
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:50,160
this is an example where people take

1522
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,359
advantage

1523
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,640
of people they'll say medical medium

1524
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,960
said zeolite's fine

1525
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,559
it removes from the brain it doesn't

1526
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,520
remove metals from the brain

1527
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,720
it never does it never can it can't

1528
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,559
leave

1529
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,319
to move metals to the brain it can't get

1530
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,400
to the brain to remove

1531
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:13,599
metals it can't do it doesn't have metal

1532
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:16,480
removing ability like that right

1533
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,200
so one reason why i don't talk about

1534
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,000
zeolite

1535
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,720
is because the unedible zeolites entered

1536
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,880
the industry

1537
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,920
and they manufacture the unedible

1538
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,040
zeolites

1539
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:32,240
with the edible zeolites

1540
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:38,000
you guys get where i'm going

1541
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:41,839
okay unedible zeolites are like asbestos

1542
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,960
they're dangerous to swallow

1543
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:48,240
unedible zealites are dangerous

1544
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:52,160
to swallow they're

1545
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,240
dusted on edible zeolites the industry

1546
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,720
has totally effed up and they've

1547
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,640
actually ruined it

1548
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,079
not that it was even that good anyway

1549
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,319
because it wasn't

1550
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,680
but everything's been dusted the

1551
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,760
manufacturing process

1552
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,720
is not trustworthy and the details

1553
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,599
matter

1554
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,160
i will never recommend zeolite again i

1555
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,280
did it

1556
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,559
years ago i've recommended it eight nine

1557
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,760
years ago

1558
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,559
for the gut only when there was a

1559
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,960
zeolite i trusted

1560
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,359
because there wasn't atlantic dulce

1561
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,599
around

1562
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,640
so that's the understanding about that

1563
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,000
so people know

1564
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,119
how things roll okay if i don't

1565
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,400
recommend it

1566
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,319
there's a reason that's all

1567
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,319
if i don't recommend something there's a

1568
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,920
reason if i don't recommend chlorella

1569
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,559
there's a serious reason if i don't

1570
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,160
recommend

1571
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,599
zeolite there's a serious reason if i

1572
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,440
don't recommend charcoal

1573
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,799
to swallow it's a serious reason if i

1574
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,440
don't recommend fish oil

1575
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,040
there's a serious reason and supplement

1576
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,920
companies have their own free will

1577
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,160
and you can't control them you can't

1578
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:02,880
control a supplement company they got

1579
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,559
their own free will

1580
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,480
so let's talk about the five ingredients

1581
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:11,520
that do work let's go into that

1582
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,839
and trust me the uneditable zeolites

1583
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:17,920
which get dusted on the edible zeolites

1584
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:20,240
are dangerous it turns into like an

1585
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,079
asbestos powder inside the intestinal

1586
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,280
tract and i will never take the zeolite

1587
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,240
because i could never trust if that

1588
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
stuff was dusted

1589
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,839
because it's like you're gluten-free and

1590
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,960
non-gluten-free if something was

1591
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:31,040
manufactured

1592
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,400
and they have to put if they manufacture

1593
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,079
something at a factory that's also

1594
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,000
manufacturing nuts and seeds and you're

1595
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,640
allergic to peanuts and nuts

1596
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,280
and it says on the package this may

1597
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,640
contain nuts

1598
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,079
even though there's no nuts in the

1599
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,799
ingredient list you hear what i'm saying

1600
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,720
you guys

1601
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,319
this may contain nuts on the package do

1602
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,359
you ever see that you grab a package and

1603
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,760
you're like hey

1604
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,839
you know there's no nuts in here let me

1605
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,520
see this package here there's no nuts in

1606
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:59,680
here but it says may contain nuts

1607
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,440
what you're not seeing on your zeolite

1608
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,880
your zeolite product

1609
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:08,160
is may contain a zeolite that's unedible

1610
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,520
that's basically like asbestos

1611
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:16,160
because they use that in industries

1612
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:16,160
and may contain that

1613
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,079
i could do what i can to protect

1614
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,040
everybody the best i can but

1615
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,599
i can't beat out a thousand admin being

1616
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,400
paid

1617
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:30,160
on social media with the mlm companies

1618
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,000
trying to get everybody to do stuff

1619
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,440
because people just i just can't stop

1620
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,119
whatever

1621
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:40,720
janet says is dolls okay for hypothyroid

1622
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:42,480
yes it is the reason why there's

1623
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,880
confusion with hypo and hyperthyroid is

1624
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,319
the

1625
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,920
they don't know science research doesn't

1626
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,520
know what causes it unless they got mm

1627
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,079
info because it's epstein-barr

1628
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:54,400
and guess what dulce is good because dos

1629
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:59,599
helps to defend you against epstein-barr

1630
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:03,040
yeah all right five ingredients

1631
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,839
okay right here five ingredients why do

1632
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,640
they work

1633
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,640
how do they work

1634
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,839
cilantro

1635
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:17,920
cilantro has a trace mineral salt

1636
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,520
attached to a phytochemical compound

1637
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,200
that trace mineral salt attached to a

1638
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,480
phytochemical compound

1639
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,079
enters the brain not only

1640
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,880
fuels the brain with the trace mineral

1641
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:32,000
salt electrolyte

1642
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,440
but cilantro's gift

1643
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,680
to us unlike other things is

1644
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,960
phytochemical compounds that remove

1645
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,440
toxic heavy metals

1646
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,839
from the brain are attached to the

1647
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,520
electrolyte

1648
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,520
that's cilantro special gift

1649
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,280
let's move on to another one and we're

1650
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,200
going to go into a couple things

1651
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:58,079
the wild blueberry the wild blueberry

1652
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,720
right wild blueberry juice frozen wild

1653
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,599
blueberries

1654
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,200
a lot of blueberry powder if you can't

1655
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,160
get a hold of by the way those wild

1656
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,240
blueberries

1657
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,520
those frozen wild blueberries try to get

1658
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,119
a hold of a juice

1659
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,640
like the wyman's one is the one i trust

1660
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,599
and i'm working with these guys and i'm

1661
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,359
proud of it

1662
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:14,799
because the fact that they can get this

1663
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,920
stuff out of a field which you couldn't

1664
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,880
believe the process

1665
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,839
stick it through it the juicer and and

1666
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,839
get it to us

1667
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,920
is a miracle i never thought that drink

1668
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,359
that dream i thought would never exist

1669
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,880
when i was a child and i wanted people

1670
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,720
to have this kind of medicine it's like

1671
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:34,720
that that was unimaginable

1672
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:36,799
and then the vimrjiwa blueberry powder

1673
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,920
right that's an option too if you can't

1674
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,599
get a hold of you know which is

1675
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,319
incorrect this stuff is like

1676
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,880
incredible it's gold right the wild

1677
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,880
blueberry

1678
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,760
emily says i can only find dulce flakes

1679
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,839
harvested on the shores

1680
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:56,720
of maine ah maine anyone know

1681
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,839
if this is okay to use i do it's

1682
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,119
fantastic to use

1683
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:06,640
fantastic so the wild blueberry

1684
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,119
it's the gatherer of metals both in the

1685
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,160
brain

1686
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,400
and the liver other organs too there's

1687
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:15,119
antioxidants in the wild blueberry

1688
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,559
that that aren't even documented nowhere

1689
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,760
near documented

1690
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,200
food science is at its infancy there's a

1691
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,599
reason for that

1692
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,319
because if food science is truly allowed

1693
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,079
to press

1694
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,240
forward and not just look at a few

1695
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,720
nutrients like they do it's allowed to

1696
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,000
press

1697
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:35,839
forward big pharma would have to then

1698
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,280
put a mandatory lock down on your wild

1699
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,280
blueberries and they would then

1700
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,480
encapsulate it and they would take it

1701
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,400
away from you right

1702
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,680
if food science was allowed to push

1703
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,960
forward

1704
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,400
and they knew that there are up to 30

1705
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,240
antioxidants plus

1706
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,559
even more undiscovered in the wild

1707
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,839
blueberry undiscovered if they knew that

1708
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,280
and they knew what the wild blueberry

1709
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:56,240
did and how it removes toxic heavy

1710
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,480
metals

1711
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,319
they would stop they would say nope wild

1712
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,640
blueberries dope no one's allowed to eat

1713
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,839
them

1714
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,319
you're gonna have to get a prescription

1715
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:07,119
by our doctor

1716
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,760
frozen wild blueberries have been sold

1717
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,559
out

1718
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,119
of the grocery store it's only temporary

1719
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,880
because

1720
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,960
here we're in the we're in the harvest

1721
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,079
season right now so light heart light

1722
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,440
heart it's good they're going to get the

1723
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,160
frozen they're going to get them out

1724
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,000
there

1725
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,599
wyman's will get them out there they're

1726
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,119
in the harvest season right now this the

1727
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,359
harvesting time right

1728
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,880
this is right now the harvesting time

1729
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,119
that's why

1730
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,640
i use this right now too like if you're

1731
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,920
out of the wild blueberry i happen to

1732
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,520
have some backups

1733
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,440
but if you're out of it that's why i use

1734
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,880
the uh wild blueberry juice i put that

1735
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,319
in the smoothie i put two to four ounces

1736
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,559
in the smoothie boom

1737
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,400
right or i take shot glass of it every

1738
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,720
day whatever but that's why i use that

1739
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,640
and then you got the vimergy well

1740
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,720
blueberry powder

1741
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,319
you have that one you got that option

1742
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,680
just of energy v is invictor

1743
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:55,200
i m imergy.com i'm not sponsored by

1744
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,520
these guys

1745
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,359
but yeah tastes so good tastes so good

1746
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,720
by the way this tastes so good it's it's

1747
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:04,319
it's it's crazy when you taste it

1748
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,559
i i don't even know what to say all

1749
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,559
right let's go into the next stuff

1750
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,720
dried cilantro anthony not a great

1751
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:15,839
option frozen cilantro

1752
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,440
is not the worst that could work

1753
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,720
but you got to put it in the smoothie

1754
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,520
right when it comes out of the freezer

1755
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,680
you can't turn it to yuck and muck

1756
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,599
cilantro works best with living water in

1757
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,319
it froze you don't want you

1758
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,520
frozen is still sketchy but you can

1759
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,280
still use it

1760
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,319
but you can't use the dried really it's

1761
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,920
just it's not going to cut it but i mean

1762
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,480
you could pop a little dried in there

1763
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,799
and you got

1764
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,319
you know you got like i mean at least

1765
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,839
the connections there even if

1766
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:45,680
something's missing

1767
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:47,760
you know so let's move on

1768
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,680
the wild blueberry chemical compounds

1769
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,039
that dislodge toxic heavy metals but

1770
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,280
hold on to them

1771
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:58,240
the wild blueberry holds on to metal

1772
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,240
holds onto metal

1773
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,720
that's what i love about it barley grass

1774
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,599
cheese powder

1775
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,319
another binder of toxic heavy metals not

1776
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,839
barley grass

1777
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,119
broadly grass cheese powder a binder

1778
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,280
i know we've been here for a while you

1779
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,200
guys so let's keep on moving through

1780
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,799
i don't want to keep you all day because

1781
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,680
we still got more time

1782
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:26,160
more fun more play coming up spirulina

1783
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:29,359
that is the toxic heavy metal remover

1784
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:31,799
it even removes radiation radiation

1785
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,039
that's what i love about spirulina

1786
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:37,520
radiation

1787
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:40,559
what removes radiation right

1788
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,559
chlorella doesn't

1789
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,599
but spirulina does okay spirulina is

1790
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,240
also

1791
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,079
um an incredible weapon against toxic

1792
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,280
heavy metals binds on to it grabs onto

1793
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,720
metals helps to bring them out now why

1794
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,720
are all these five together and then

1795
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,559
left atlantic dulce which is the best

1796
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,799
one for the intestinal tract now

1797
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,920
have no fear if you don't have atlantic

1798
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,839
dolls

1799
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,200
you can keep it out and still do the

1800
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,359
cleanse and still do the heavy metal

1801
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,680
detox smoothie

1802
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:12,000
it's atlantic dolls not pacific you

1803
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,480
don't want pacific dolls atlantic dolls

1804
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,559
you don't want pacific sparrow lena you

1805
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,680
don't want pacific spirulina i talk

1806
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,880
about that all the time

1807
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:23,680
why you don't oceans are too polluted

1808
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,200
and the garbage patch has shifted

1809
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:30,480
more than a couple of hundred miles

1810
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:34,160
the garbage patch is actually

1811
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:37,280
embroaching the pacific

1812
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:40,160
coast it's really sad

1813
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,640
so yeah i don't like pacific spirulina

1814
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,559
so

1815
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:44,799
this one's the best anyway it's better

1816
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,000
even if i like pacific if pacific the

1817
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,799
ocean was still

1818
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,640
like good or good enough or even better

1819
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,640
this is the best one out there by far

1820
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,520
the cleanest and the most potent

1821
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:58,000
that's the bemidji all of these work

1822
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,000
together

1823
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:04,640
so that the metal doesn't drop

1824
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:09,200
so that the metal doesn't drop right

1825
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:13,680
all this works together

1826
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,680
so that the metal doesn't drop

1827
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,599
so if i'm a wild blueberry

1828
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:21,359
moving through the body i'm a wild

1829
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,039

01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:18,880

juice

1902
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,920

you do the lemon water wait 15 to 32

1906
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,000
minutes you know upon waking you do

1907

lemon water wait 15 to 30 minutes right

1908
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,839
16 13 ounces of lemon water

1909
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,080
and then you move into the celery juice

1910
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,080
right

1911
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:17,520
can you go to the library when you get a

1912
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,359
chance and pick up cleanse the heal

1913
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,040

library get it for free

1915
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,000
don't even do the 51 off at amazon.com

1916
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:28,560
with this book specifically and that 51

1917
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
off isn't with like all amazon books

1918
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,239

a little bit more blueberry they control

1922
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,279
the price and for some reason i think an

1923
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,319
angel has intercepted into the amazon

1924
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,040
machine

1925
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,239
and has made that book so inexpensive it

1926
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,080
costs more to print it

1927
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,080
it's it's actually a miracle so

1928
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:02,159

1929
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:03,760
