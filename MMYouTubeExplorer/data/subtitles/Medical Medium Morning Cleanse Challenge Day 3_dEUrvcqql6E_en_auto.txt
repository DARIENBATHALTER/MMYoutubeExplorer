[90.16 - 93.68] your oats
[91.28 - 94.64] not a lot of people do millet but this
[93.68 - 98.48] is a better
[94.64 - 99.60] grain a way better grain healthier in so
[98.48 - 102.08] many ways
[99.60 - 102.80] it does more for you than oats can do
[102.08 - 104.64] even though i'm
[102.80 - 106.48] fine if you guys love your oats your
[104.64 - 107.36] gluten-free oats but the millet is
[106.48 - 109.28] definitely an
[107.36 - 110.72] option so what i'm gonna do is get it
[109.28 - 112.64] simmering and cooking now
[110.72 - 114.00] why i'm here good to see you guys i'm
[112.64 - 116.16] excited that you're here so i'm making

[145.84 - 149.12] doing it which is incredible and you're
[147.36 - 152.16] doing it for eight months now
[149.12 - 154.48] and the just have all that like
[152.16 - 156.08] behind you like that getting you strong
[154.48 - 157.76] so when the holidays come
[156.08 - 159.28] you put all those months of that time
[157.76 - 160.80] and energy into it during the morning
[159.28 - 162.96] cleanse i'm really proud of you
[160.80 - 165.84] and um it says exciting time but we can
[162.96 - 167.36] jump on it now too we can start it now
[165.84 - 169.04] that's what's incredible we can start
[167.36 - 172.08] doing it now so
[169.04 - 174.16] um grains are
[172.08 - 175.36] scratchy though to me michelle l says
[174.16 - 178.16] yeah well grains
[175.36 - 180.16] are not a big part of medical medium
[178.16 - 182.72] foods and information
[180.16 - 183.84] a lot of people have different feelings
[182.72 - 186.40] towards them they have different
[183.84 - 189.68] sensations they have different reactions
[186.40 - 191.76] the only two grains that i really like
[189.68 - 193.44] if someone's gonna do grains are millet
[191.76 - 196.40] which is a really
[193.44 - 198.00] gentle gentle grain that one right there
[196.40 - 200.08] and that's what i'm to do
[198.00 - 201.20] or oats those two but i like millet
[200.08 - 203.04] better because
[201.20 - 204.24] people who are sensitive can do better
[203.04 - 207.92] with it if
[204.24 - 210.56] you want a grain so um
[207.92 - 212.32] so what i'm going to do is take a cup
[210.56 - 215.04] right here of millet
[212.32 - 216.08] so i'm excited about this just dropped a
[215.04 - 220.24] little bit up and that's
[216.08 - 220.24] putting it in the pot here
[221.28 - 227.84] so there we go it's about a cup
[228.96 - 232.96] of millet and then i'm going to show you
[231.68 - 234.72] over here i don't know if you guys could
[232.96 - 238.00] see it hopefully
[234.72 - 238.00] so that's it in a pot right there
[239.44 - 245.44] okay and i'm going to add the water two
[242.64 - 245.44] cups of water
[246.64 - 252.80] in here now with millet
[250.88 - 255.20] you just got to simmer it for about 25
[252.80 - 257.28] minutes sometimes depending it could
[255.20 - 259.52] take a half an hour
[257.28 - 260.80] i'm going to bring it to a boil simmer
[259.52 - 263.28] it
[260.80 - 265.20] and what's going to happen it's going to
[263.28 - 267.52] be this glorious thing i'm going to make
[265.20 - 269.04] millet porridge so basically can be the
[267.52 - 270.16] wild blueberry porridge but with millet
[269.04 - 272.72] instead of oatmeal
[270.16 - 274.16] i'm also going to make the smoothie so i
[272.72 - 274.64] can't wait the apple cinnamon smoothie
[274.16 - 276.80] so
[274.64 - 278.56] let's talk about the morning cleanse a
[276.80 - 279.36] little bit glad everybody's here this is
[278.56 - 282.24] exciting
[279.36 - 284.40] so let's start with the lemon water got
[282.24 - 288.16] it right here
[284.40 - 290.48] and so
[288.16 - 291.52] you can do lemon water you can do lime
[290.48 - 294.48] water
[291.52 - 296.64] i did lime water yesterday i'm cutting a
[294.48 - 299.52] lemon now
[296.64 - 300.72] over here so it's my lemon as you guys
[299.52 - 304.16] can see i don't know how
[300.72 - 307.36] if you can all right putting half a
[304.16 - 307.36] lemon in here like this
[309.36 - 317.28] upon waking 16 to 32 ounces
[313.52 - 319.92] of lemon water really important to flush
[317.28 - 319.92] out the liver
[320.72 - 324.00] here's a really important point you can
[323.28 - 325.84] let people know
[324.00 - 327.68] when you see it in the you know when
[325.84 - 330.16] people are commenting about it
[327.68 - 331.04] and talking about it this is a critical
[330.16 - 334.00] point right here
[331.04 - 335.20] you know what it is it's do not use hot
[334.00 - 338.08] water
[335.20 - 339.36] if you use hot water you can't flush the
[338.08 - 342.16] liver
[339.36 - 342.96] you cannot flush the liver of the toxins
[342.16 - 345.04] in the morning
[342.96 - 346.00] to get them out i'll tell you what goes
[345.04 - 348.48] wrong when you use
[346.00 - 349.04] hot water this this is a mistake that
[348.48 - 352.96] came
[349.04 - 357.04] after medical medium information so
[352.96 - 360.56] medical medium information was
[357.04 - 363.44] 16 to 32 ounces of lemon water
[360.56 - 364.48] okay squeezed into lukewarm water room
[363.44 - 367.12] temperature water
[364.48 - 367.92] or cold water first thing in the morning
[367.12 - 371.44] to flush
[367.92 - 373.04] the liver and flush the body of toxins
[371.44 - 374.48] it's original medical medium information
[373.04 - 376.48] with lemon water
[374.48 - 378.40] and what happened was as the years went
[376.48 - 380.72] on all the teaching
[378.40 - 382.16] all the lecturing i did all the teaching
[380.72 - 384.80] different practitioners
[382.16 - 387.28] doctors throughout the years it the
[384.80 - 389.60] lemon water thing caught on to flush
[387.28 - 390.96] to actually flush toxins out of the body
[389.60 - 392.40] stemmed from originally from the medical
[390.96 - 393.84] medium information but what
[392.40 - 395.68] something here's what went wrong with
[393.84 - 398.72] the information somebody said
[395.68 - 399.92] do it in hot water well they just ruined
[398.72 - 402.32] it for a lot of people
[399.92 - 403.04] so it's it's really becomes a wasted
[402.32 - 405.36] effort
[403.04 - 406.88] if it's done in hot water now herbal tea
[405.36 - 408.08] is another story because with herbal tea
[406.88 - 410.32] when you put lemon in herbal
[408.08 - 411.68] tea you're doing an herbal extraction
[410.32 - 413.28] and what you're really trying to get out
[411.68 - 414.80] of that herbal tea anyway is an herbal
[413.28 - 416.88] extraction so that's different but this
[414.80 - 419.92] is a different situation right here
[416.88 - 422.00] so um and
[419.92 - 423.68] what people also do another piece of
[422.00 - 424.96] information that doesn't work is it not
[423.68 - 428.08] only put lemon in
[424.96 - 430.64] hot water which is not good but
[428.08 - 432.72] put lemon in a cup of hot water so have
[430.64 - 433.44] your lemon water like eight ounces or a
[432.72 - 436.80] cup
[433.44 - 439.84] that won't work either so it's basically
[436.80 - 440.64] distorting medical medium information so
[439.84 - 442.72] that people
[440.64 - 443.84] don't get a healing benefit and don't
[442.72 - 447.84] move forward
[443.84 - 450.96] these details are critical the details
[447.84 - 453.76] matter they matter with getting
[450.96 - 454.48] past the finish line they matter with
[453.76 - 457.04] actually
[454.48 - 457.84] really healing and getting yourself
[457.04 - 459.52] better
[457.84 - 461.12] they really count these details and
[459.52 - 462.64] that's the difference of medical medium
[461.12 - 466.40] information versus other
[462.64 - 467.92] so once again 16 to 32 ounces
[466.40 - 470.48] of lemon water for seeing the morning
[467.92 - 472.72] upon waking to flush out the liver
[470.48 - 474.00] and the body of toxins okay so that's
[472.72 - 476.24] what you do
[474.00 - 477.04] and then it was distorted as the years
[476.24 - 478.64] went by
[477.04 - 480.72] because medical medium information has
[478.64 - 481.60] gone around the world and then some
[480.72 - 483.76] health hacks
[481.60 - 484.88] in in the health industry or some health
[483.76 - 486.80] gurus decided
[484.88 - 488.24] oh no yeah you do your lemon water but
[486.80 - 490.96] put it in hot water
[488.24 - 492.32] and here's what goes wrong the hot water
[490.96 - 494.64] stays in your stomach
[492.32 - 497.04] your body will not release hot water
[494.64 - 499.36] from your stomach until it cools down
[497.04 - 500.32] if it holds onto the lemon too long in
[499.36 - 502.56] your stomach
[500.32 - 504.64] the lemon will lose its potency the
[502.56 - 506.80] ability to actually be able to help you
[504.64 - 507.84] the second thing is you're destroying
[506.80 - 511.04] the lemons
[507.84 - 514.08] critical enzymes so a fresh raw
[511.04 - 515.68] lemon has enzymes that help the process
[514.08 - 517.76] in flushing the liver
[515.68 - 519.76] that disappears the minute you put it in
[517.76 - 520.96] hot water that's the disaster right
[519.76 - 522.08] there so i just want to give you guys
[520.96 - 524.00] that rundown so
[522.08 - 525.84] you do your lemon water then you do your
[524.00 - 534.08] celery juice
[525.84 - 537.20] i'm going to grab mine right here
[534.08 - 539.60] so i got my celery juice that's it
[537.20 - 541.28] um not juicy today because i got a lot
[539.60 - 543.28] of stuff to cook right now
[541.28 - 544.56] this has come to a boil pretty much it's
[543.28 - 546.88] simmering so these
[544.56 - 548.16] are this is going to be the wild
[546.88 - 550.96] blueberry porridge
[548.16 - 551.60] from millet so i'm using millet this
[550.96 - 555.12] time
[551.60 - 557.92] millet is a better grain than oats
[555.12 - 559.92] by far there's a lot there's a lot more
[557.92 - 562.00] phytochemical compounds there's a lot
[559.92 - 564.96] more nutrition in it there's
[562.00 - 566.72] there's um with millet it's gentle on
[564.96 - 568.72] the intestinal lining
[566.72 - 571.52] so it's one of the only grains that's
[568.72 - 573.28] actually gentle to the intestinal tract
[571.52 - 574.80] and still if someone's sensitive with
[573.28 - 576.40] grains they don't have to do grains of
[574.80 - 577.52] course not but i know that a lot of
[576.40 - 579.92] people do greens
[577.52 - 581.52] they do them around the holidays they
[579.92 - 583.68] they eat bread of course around the
[581.52 - 584.64] holidays cookies everything else in the
[583.68 - 586.64] sun
[584.64 - 588.56] and i know a lot of people do oatmeal
[586.64 - 591.36] and oatmeal is okay
[588.56 - 592.72] but millet is that next step better when
[591.36 - 595.20] it comes down to grain so
[592.72 - 596.96] i said you know why don't i make the
[595.20 - 599.04] wild blueberry porridge with millet
[596.96 - 600.56] so you guys have an option i'm turning
[599.04 - 601.28] down the burner a little bit you'll see
[600.56 - 605.68] it
[601.28 - 607.92] you'll see it cranking in here
[605.68 - 607.92] so
[608.88 - 613.60] there we go so that's what i love i love
[612.08 - 616.88] showing you guys different options
[613.60 - 619.44] so you have other ways to help heal
[616.88 - 621.44] so i'm going to let this simmer and do
[619.44 - 623.36] its thing
[621.44 - 624.96] it's just cranking a little hot so i'm
[623.36 - 627.44] going to take the lid off a little bit
[624.96 - 627.44] there we go
[628.00 - 633.84] but anyway after the 16 to 32 ounces of
[630.72 - 636.96] lemon water
[633.84 - 639.04] you wait 15 to 30 minutes okay
[636.96 - 641.36] and you move into celery juice then you
[639.04 - 644.08] do 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice
[641.36 - 645.60] we'll talk about the power that has as
[644.08 - 647.36] well so the celery juice
[645.60 - 649.12] has a lot going for it a lot more than
[647.36 - 651.12] what people know they don't
[649.12 - 653.36] know what's in celery juice they don't
[651.12 - 655.20] know what celery juice does for them
[653.36 - 657.44] and one of the best parts about celery
[655.20 - 658.72] juice is it revives your stomach glands
[657.44 - 660.56] so you got these two little stomach
[658.72 - 663.68] glands in your stomach okay
[660.56 - 667.44] those stomach glands create your hcl
[663.68 - 668.00] your gastric acid so those stomach
[667.44 - 670.88] glands
[668.00 - 672.40] get burnt out in everybody that's why
[670.88 - 674.80] things go wrong
[672.40 - 676.24] when those stomach lands get burned out
[674.80 - 680.40] you can't produce enough
[676.24 - 683.20] hcl and that hcl kills off bugs
[680.40 - 684.88] pathogens it stops us from bloating that
[683.20 - 688.00] hcl
[684.88 - 690.00] breaks down protein and it
[688.00 - 692.00] stops proteins from rotting and
[690.00 - 693.28] putrefying so everybody walks around
[692.00 - 695.20] with low hcl
[693.28 - 696.88] hydrochloric acid and then their
[695.20 - 699.36] proteins putrefy
[696.88 - 700.32] in their gut and start to rot and when
[699.36 - 702.80] they start to rot
[700.32 - 703.92] it feeds more bacteria that's not good
[702.80 - 707.04] bacteria
[703.92 - 707.68] celery juice brings back your stomach
[707.04 - 709.84] glands
[707.68 - 710.96] allowing them to produce the gastric
[709.84 - 713.36] acid needed
[710.96 - 714.72] the hydrochloric acid medical beam
[713.36 - 717.92] information is the seven
[714.72 - 720.56] blend hcl because hcl isn't just one
[717.92 - 722.08] acid it's a blend of seven and when you
[720.56 - 725.28] lose your gastric glands
[722.08 - 727.20] the gastric gland strength those acids
[725.28 - 729.60] they weaken and you lose like three of
[727.20 - 730.80] the seven four of the seven so your hcl
[729.60 - 734.08] isn't strong
[730.80 - 737.44] and uh celery juice brings that
[734.08 - 739.36] back stabilizes the the stomach glands

[883.04 - 888.08] slowly incredible
[884.56 - 890.40] that's incredible it really is all right
[888.08 - 891.92] let's make this now listen on the
[890.40 - 894.48] medical meeting morning cleanse
[891.92 - 896.32] okay you got your 16 out there 32 ounces
[894.48 - 899.92] of lemon water i showed you
[896.32 - 902.56] right you guys 15 to 30 minutes later
[899.92 - 903.60] you got your 16 to 32 ounces of celery
[902.56 - 906.08] juice right
[903.60 - 906.80] okay you can do fresh fruit after that
[906.08 - 908.32] you can have a
[906.80 - 910.00] breakfast of like fresh fruit you could
[908.32 - 911.92] have melons cut up
[910.00 - 913.20] you could have mangoes papayas you can
[911.92 - 915.92] go with something a little denser
[913.20 - 918.40] papayas and bananas you can do that
[915.92 - 921.68] or you can go further than that not just
[918.40 - 923.28] have a smoothie or a fruit bowl
[921.68 - 924.80] you can have steamed potatoes sweet
[923.28 - 926.80] potatoes if you really want
[924.80 - 928.88] something more denser you can mill it
[926.80 - 930.72] you can have oatmeal if you really want
[928.88 - 933.52] that's an option too you can have winter
[930.72 - 934.80] squash that's one there yams is another
[933.52 - 937.60] option so you can have that
[934.80 - 939.12] right but you can also have the heavy
[937.60 - 940.48] metal detox smoothie
[939.12 - 942.00] that's one of my favorites because
[940.48 - 943.84] you're getting metals out you can have a
[942.00 - 945.60] liver rescue smoothie you can have that
[943.84 - 949.68] option
[945.60 - 951.76] so okay so let's work on this right now
[949.68 - 953.68] so we need two medium-sized
[951.76 - 955.28] red apples so that's the first thing
[953.68 - 957.84] right there
[955.28 - 960.00] so two medium sized red apples i got a
[957.84 - 963.04] red apple right here
[960.00 - 965.04] and i got another one right here so mary
[963.04 - 965.52] says i missed the recipe for the lemon
[965.04 - 968.16] juice
[965.52 - 968.64] drink i do make my own celery juice
[968.16 - 971.12] already
[968.64 - 972.08] incredible very amazing so the recipe
[971.12 - 974.16] for this
[972.08 - 975.20] is you get your 16 to 32 ounces of water
[974.16 - 978.40] you cut
[975.20 - 979.20] a lemon in half that's one half i just
[978.40 - 982.32] squeezed
[979.20 - 984.56] okay and you squeeze it in there now the
[982.32 - 986.80] key is don't put it in hot water
[984.56 - 988.88] don't do the hot water make sure it's 16
[986.80 - 989.68] to 32 ounces and do it upon waking in
[988.88 - 991.60] the morning
[989.68 - 993.36] that's the key wait 15 to 30 minutes
[991.60 - 996.16] before you do the celery juice
[993.36 - 998.64] so all right going to cut some apple
[996.16 - 998.64] right now
[1007.76 - 1015.46] [Music]
[1009.68 - 1020.32] this over put my apple pieces in here
[1015.46 - 1021.92] [Music]
[1020.32 - 1023.44] just reading some comments at the same
[1021.92 - 1024.80] time
[1023.44 - 1026.32] i gotta do the sporting cleanse
[1024.80 - 1029.04] challenge more often because this is
[1026.32 - 1029.04] really fun
[1030.93 - 1035.04] [Music]
[1032.64 - 1039.28] so i just cut that apple if you guys can
[1035.04 - 1041.52] see that's the cord
[1039.28 - 1042.27] so cut another one i could use this
[1041.52 - 1043.44] knife too
[1042.27 - 1044.72] [Music]
[1043.44 - 1047.36] you could do it a lot of different i
[1044.72 - 1053.28] mean i like using the small knives too
[1047.36 - 1055.92] so that's that's the way i've done it
[1053.28 - 1057.28] so cutting up the apple so this is two
[1055.92 - 1060.34] medium-sized apples
[1057.28 - 1060.34] [Music]
[1061.36 - 1065.12] you don't want to put the core in
[1063.84 - 1066.80] because you're just going to blend the
[1065.12 - 1069.36] seeds up
[1066.80 - 1070.88] the seeds are bitter so apple seeds are
[1069.36 - 1072.08] bitter and if you blend that
[1070.88 - 1073.52] up you're just going to make you're
[1072.08 - 1074.56] going to make this smoothie bitter so
[1073.52 - 1077.12] that's something right there
[1074.56 - 1079.12] now these are frozen bananas i'm going
[1077.12 - 1082.48] to show you next
[1079.12 - 1084.56] so one and a half frozen bananas
[1082.48 - 1085.68] so look at these great frozen bananas i
[1084.56 - 1087.70] have right here
[1085.68 - 1090.08] so i'm gonna put these in
[1087.70 - 1095.36] [Music]
[1090.08 - 1097.60] break these pieces up
[1095.36 - 1100.08] and i'm gonna do a half a frozen banana
[1097.60 - 1100.08] right here
[1103.68 - 1108.72] okay we got that going on and um all
[1108.08 - 1112.08] right so
[1108.72 - 1114.40] that's in here so i'm going to do one
[1112.08 - 1117.44] cup of water
[1114.40 - 1118.56] so that's my water right here got that
[1117.44 - 1120.56] in there nice
[1118.56 - 1123.12] now this recipe just so you know if you
[1120.56 - 1126.16] just got on here
[1123.12 - 1129.20] this recipe's out of cleanse the heel
[1126.16 - 1133.28] that's the book okay it's the apple
[1129.20 - 1134.84] cinnamon smoothie there it is
[1133.28 - 1136.40] that's the recipe that's what we're
[1134.84 - 1139.52] making
[1136.40 - 1139.52] it tastes so good
[1140.08 - 1144.24] so i'm really excited so i'm going to
[1141.84 - 1144.56] put a teaspoon of maple syrup in here
[1144.24 - 1151.84] too
[1144.56 - 1151.84] just so you know
[1152.64 - 1156.00] now you can put a date in there i like i
[1154.56 - 1159.04] like the maple syrup so i have this
[1156.00 - 1159.04] maple syrup right here
[1161.20 - 1164.32] now a teaspoon you could measure i'm
[1162.88 - 1166.32] just going to dump it right in if you
[1164.32 - 1168.16] guys don't mind
[1166.32 - 1170.96] i put probably a little bit more than a
[1168.16 - 1173.76] teaspoon in there
[1170.96 - 1177.04] of course and then i'm going to drop
[1173.76 - 1177.04] some cinnamon in there now
[1177.28 - 1182.08] you got the cinnamon okay and this is
[1180.64 - 1183.28] the recipe out of cleanse to heal just
[1182.08 - 1184.48] so you know so i'm going to drop some
[1183.28 - 1188.08] cinnamon in there too
[1184.48 - 1190.48] so it's three quarters
[1188.08 - 1193.84] three quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon
[1190.48 - 1193.84] this is how to cleanse the heel
[1194.64 - 1198.40] it's a question right there aren't apple
[1196.56 - 1201.92] skins
[1198.40 - 1205.28] aren't apple skins um
[1201.92 - 1207.28] full of pesticides so well these are
[1205.28 - 1209.20] organic apples
[1207.28 - 1211.36] that's number one so i have organic
[1209.20 - 1215.20] apples here so keep that in mind
[1211.36 - 1218.16] um yeah if you get in conventional apple
[1215.20 - 1219.04] and it was sprayed recently before
[1218.16 - 1220.88] harvest
[1219.04 - 1222.96] so conventional apple if it's sprayed
[1220.88 - 1225.52] close to harvest okay
[1222.96 - 1227.36] if that's the case then you're going to
[1225.52 - 1230.48] have some pesticides on that apple
[1227.36 - 1231.36] okay and then they wax them so they put
[1230.48 - 1233.68] the msg
[1231.36 - 1235.84] wax on top of a conventional apple and
[1233.68 - 1236.64] they coat those pesticides and almost
[1235.84 - 1238.88] kind of
[1236.64 - 1240.48] encapsulate them on the skin
[1238.88 - 1242.72] conventional apples i
[1240.48 - 1243.60] i peel so that's what i would do is just
[1242.72 - 1245.76] peel them
[1243.60 - 1248.88] these are organic ones so i'm gonna put
[1245.76 - 1251.44] three quarters of a teaspoon
[1248.88 - 1252.88] i'm putting the cinnamon in here that's
[1251.44 - 1254.72] about right there
[1252.88 - 1256.08] about three quarters of a teaspoon
[1254.72 - 1258.16] probably a little bit more
[1256.08 - 1259.68] okay and then i'm going to blend it up i
[1258.16 - 1263.84] got the water in here so
[1259.68 - 1263.84] now it's time to blend it up
[1264.72 - 1270.65] so glad to have you guys here this is
[1267.61 - 1270.65] [Music]
[1272.81 - 1277.84] [Music]
[1274.84 - 1277.84] awesome
[1280.15 - 1283.45] [Music]
[1292.64 - 1305.84] so i really like this smoothie
[1306.64 - 1310.00] what i love about these recipes is that
[1309.60 - 1313.60] they're
[1310.00 - 1319.84] healing recipes and
[1313.60 - 1319.84] there's something to be said about them
[1347.20 - 1353.84] okay it's all set
[1349.28 - 1357.20] [Music]
[1353.84 - 1359.84] so um i have the smoothie right here and
[1357.20 - 1375.20] i have a cup too but i'm gonna use this
[1359.84 - 1376.64] real quick
[1375.20 - 1378.88] you can put a little cinnamon right on
[1376.64 - 1378.88] top
[1381.92 - 1388.72] i like to put a little bit of cinnamon
[1383.60 - 1389.92] right on top
[1388.72 - 1391.12] that's what i like to do i don't know if
[1389.92 - 1393.20] you guys can see this i don't want to
[1391.12 - 1396.40] spill it over but there it is
[1393.20 - 1396.40] i think you guys can see this
[1397.68 - 1403.84] now i'm going to do a little grated
[1400.84 - 1403.84] ginger
[1404.08 - 1408.40] now what i like to do is do the fresh
[1406.00 - 1408.40] ginger
[1411.52 - 1417.84] so i got a piece of ginger right here
[1418.24 - 1423.84] now the recipe calls to blend in the
[1421.36 - 1423.84] ginger
[1429.44 - 1433.52] i like to put it on top of mine but look
[1432.32 - 1437.28] you know that
[1433.52 - 1437.28] it's it's great blending it into
[1438.96 - 1442.40] the millet is actually simmering over
[1440.80 - 1444.16] there
[1442.40 - 1446.72] but what i like to do is i like to just
[1444.16 - 1450.56] grate a little bit of
[1446.72 - 1452.96] ginger fresh ginger right on top
[1450.56 - 1452.96] like this
[1456.32 - 1459.84] there you go
[1465.68 - 1471.44] now i put extra for me
[1468.72 - 1472.00] since you know i mean look you could do
[1471.44 - 1474.00] you can do
[1472.00 - 1475.28] a lot less but i put fresh ginger right
[1474.00 - 1477.28] on top it's grated
[1475.28 - 1486.16] right on top just like that and what i
[1477.28 - 1488.00] like to do is take a spoon
[1486.16 - 1489.68] and i kind of like just to mix it up and
[1488.00 - 1491.12] i like to use a spoon to eat it that's
[1489.68 - 1493.52] that's the way i like to do it then you
[1491.12 - 1496.64] can drink out of the glass too
[1493.52 - 1501.04] so put this right here where you guys
[1496.64 - 1504.08] can see it
[1501.04 - 1504.08] so that's the apple
[1504.40 - 1507.84] cinnamon smoothie right there that i
[1506.80 - 1509.36] just made
[1507.84 - 1512.08] it's out of cleanse the heel the book
[1509.36 - 1512.08] cleanse the heel
[1512.96 - 1516.24] which is this book right here
[1517.92 - 1523.12] and um
[1521.84 - 1525.68] we're doing the medical meeting morning
[1523.12 - 1527.92] cleanse and this is an incredible
[1525.68 - 1529.28] incredible meal right there so i want to
[1527.92 - 1529.84] cover a couple little things with you
[1529.28 - 1533.28] guys
[1529.84 - 1533.28] just moving stuff out of the way here
[1533.84 - 1538.96] [Music]
[1535.68 - 1540.72] you can do lime instead of lemon water
[1538.96 - 1543.04] just another option you can do lime
[1540.72 - 1544.80] because that people ask about that all
[1543.04 - 1546.72] the time and i got limes right here but
[1544.80 - 1548.64] you can do limes that's perfectly fine
[1546.72 - 1550.08] so that's an option in your lemon water
[1548.64 - 1553.12] but lemon is
[1550.08 - 1556.48] is usually best a lot of time
[1553.12 - 1559.60] limes are really dry so that happens

[1600.80 - 1605.36] um nina says i love millet too awesome
[1606.16 - 1609.44] if you're somebody that if you're
[1607.84 - 1610.32] somebody that has any kind of acid
[1609.44 - 1611.92] reflux
[1610.32 - 1614.80] struggling with your digestive problem
[1611.92 - 1616.16] on any level um

[1616.16 - 1619.92] eating cleanses so that's that's a great
[1618.32 - 1621.52] option right there for you like the mono

[1621.52 - 1624.72] the potato mono eating cleanse you can
[1624.08 - 1626.80] do
[1624.72 - 1629.28] the papaya one that's an option all on
[1626.80 - 1629.28] its own
[1630.00 - 1634.16] all it says it's an incredible smoothie
[1631.68 - 1636.72] have you had it before
[1634.16 - 1637.44] amazing so here's what you want to do
[1636.72 - 1640.08] with your
[1637.44 - 1641.20] medical medium morning cleanse you want
[1640.08 - 1643.76] to keep the fats
[1641.20 - 1645.20] out of your morning the key is
[1643.76 - 1647.04] protecting your liver
[1645.20 - 1648.72] the key is getting your liver better the
[1647.04 - 1650.08] key is about getting the toxins out of
[1648.72 - 1653.28] your liver and you might be like
[1650.08 - 1654.08] well do i have a liver issue well do i
[1653.28 - 1655.92] really have one
[1654.08 - 1657.68] if you have any unwanted weight like if
[1655.92 - 1659.68] you're gaining weight ever in your life
[1657.68 - 1662.24] that means your liver is maxed out
[1659.68 - 1663.92] and that means the liver is all it's all
[1662.24 - 1665.52] filled up with fat to begin with
[1663.92 - 1667.12] so that's the start of the problem right
[1665.52 - 1668.32] there so if you have any kind of weight
[1667.12 - 1670.16] issues on any level
[1668.32 - 1671.76] if you're gaining weight on any level
[1670.16 - 1673.84] the liver is maxed out
[1671.76 - 1675.68] it's got too much fat inside the liver
[1673.84 - 1677.84] so that's number one that's one problem
[1675.68 - 1680.32] all on its own that that people have
[1677.84 - 1683.00] if you have skin issues like vitiligo
[1680.32 - 1685.92] eczema psoriasis rosacea
[1683.00 - 1687.76] dermatitis dandruff
[1685.92 - 1689.12] that's all a liver issue so that's a
[1687.76 - 1691.60] liver problem right there
[1689.12 - 1693.12] if you have heart palpitations if you're
[1691.60 - 1694.40] dealing with migraines
[1693.12 - 1696.32] if you're dealing with any kind of
[1694.40 - 1699.52] autoimmune the liver is involved
[1696.32 - 1702.56] too so crohn's colitis
[1699.52 - 1705.12] acid reflux celiac ibs
[1702.56 - 1707.12] the liver is involved that's a big part
[1705.12 - 1708.88] of why there's a problem so
[1707.12 - 1709.92] all this is important to know so what
[1708.88 - 1712.32] you're doing with the medical media
[1709.92 - 1713.68] morning cleanse is you're restoring your
[1712.32 - 1715.68] liver you're bringing
[1713.68 - 1717.92] your liver back you're bringing your
[1715.68 - 1719.60] liver to where it needs to be
[1717.92 - 1721.12] you're giving it a chance to heal and
[1719.60 - 1724.16] here's the thing
[1721.12 - 1724.96] your liver wants a routine that's what
[1724.16 - 1727.36] it wants
[1724.96 - 1728.96] it wants to do a routine every single
[1727.36 - 1730.56] day and we break that routine by
[1728.96 - 1731.84] bringing in fats in the morning we end
[1730.56 - 1734.48] up bringing in eggs
[1731.84 - 1736.24] we end up bringing in um we end up
[1734.48 - 1738.24] bringing an avocado toast
[1736.24 - 1740.00] and i never said avocados bad to eat if
[1738.24 - 1741.44] you want to eat some avocado but have it
[1740.00 - 1743.28] afternoon
[1741.44 - 1744.48] have it afternoon that's the time to
[1743.28 - 1746.00] have it if you're going to have it
[1744.48 - 1747.12] if you're going to have nuts and seeds
[1746.00 - 1748.40] if you're going to have walnuts if
[1747.12 - 1749.84] you're going to have hemp seeds if
[1748.40 - 1752.32] you're going to have almonds
[1749.84 - 1754.00] nut butters peanut butter have it
[1752.32 - 1755.52] afternoon you want to do the medical
[1754.00 - 1758.48] medium morning cleanse and be
[1755.52 - 1759.52] fat free in the morning as far as
[1758.48 - 1762.72] radical fats
[1759.52 - 1764.16] no milk cheese butter no bacon no eggs
[1762.72 - 1767.20] no meat no chicken
[1764.16 - 1768.80] no nut butters no oat milk no oat milk
[1767.20 - 1770.56] because it's concentrated it's higher
[1768.80 - 1773.12] fat and there's no soy milk
[1770.56 - 1774.80] no almond milk you want to keep all of
[1773.12 - 1777.12] that out of your breakfast
[1774.80 - 1778.40] out of your morning and you want to do
[1777.12 - 1780.24] your lemon water
[1778.40 - 1781.76] you want to do your celery juice you
[1780.24 - 1783.68] want to do your heavy metal detox
[1781.76 - 1785.60] smoothie your liver rescue smoothie you
[1783.68 - 1787.36] want to do some fruit bowls
[1785.60 - 1789.20] when you do fruit and the fruit
[1787.36 - 1790.00] smoothies or the heavy metal detox
[1789.20 - 1792.80] smoothie
[1790.00 - 1793.44] you're maximizing the most healing you
[1792.80 - 1796.72] can do
[1793.44 - 1799.68] in the morning and then that's and then
[1796.72 - 1800.72] afternoon you can bring in those nuts if
[1799.68 - 1804.32] you want or your
[1800.72 - 1808.72] avocados or something like that
[1804.32 - 1811.36] so i got the millet cooking right here
[1808.72 - 1811.36] and it's done
[1812.72 - 1823.84] turning it down
[1824.24 - 1827.84] so this millet is is nicely cooked here
[1827.20 - 1830.24] it is
[1827.84 - 1830.96] now it's b it's this beautiful yellow
[1830.24 - 1836.24] you see this
[1830.96 - 1838.56] creamy yellow that's right here and
[1836.24 - 1840.56] that's it so instead of oatmeal we're
[1838.56 - 1843.60] doing millet so i'm gonna add
[1840.56 - 1845.04] in the wild blueberries these are the
[1843.60 - 1851.84] frozen wild blueberries
[1845.04 - 1851.84] right here i'm gonna add some in
[1855.92 - 1860.56] now i'm gonna mix them up in here so
[1859.04 - 1862.96] this is the medical medium
[1860.56 - 1865.84] wild blueberry porridge we're doing it
[1862.96 - 1865.84] with millet
[1868.72 - 1873.76] i mean millet is an incredible tasting
[1871.12 - 1876.48] grain if you're into grains
[1873.76 - 1879.84] all right so i'm gonna put it in a bowl
[1876.48 - 1879.84] right now
[1887.44 - 1893.84] and you can put some blueberries right
[1888.88 - 1893.84] on top
[1898.08 - 1903.44] so i'm going to put a few blueberries
[1899.84 - 1905.04] sprinkle them right on top like that
[1903.44 - 1907.28] and then i'm going to add some maple
[1905.04 - 1909.76] syrup
[1907.28 - 1909.76] right here
[1910.32 - 1915.20] so that is the the wild blueberry
[1913.36 - 1916.96] millet porridge versus oats and i'm
[1915.20 - 1921.84] going to put a little bit of maple syrup
[1916.96 - 1921.84] right on top here
[1923.84 - 1928.80] and that's it and it's
[1927.12 - 1930.48] really an incredible dish it's a hearty
[1928.80 - 1931.68] dish if you're somebody that wants that

[1941.92 - 1945.28] with the celery juice also the in the
[1943.60 - 1945.92] morning and the lemon water is always
[1945.28 - 1948.32] best for
[1945.92 - 1950.08] maximizing your cleanse but at least
[1948.32 - 1951.68] there's no fats added in here so there's
[1950.08 - 1953.28] no nut butters there's no peanut butters
[1951.68 - 1956.48] there's no coconut oil
