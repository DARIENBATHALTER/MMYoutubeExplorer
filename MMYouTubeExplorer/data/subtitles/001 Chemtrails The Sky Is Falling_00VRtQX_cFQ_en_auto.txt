[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 45.68] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 48.36] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[45.68 - 49.24] William hey everybody we're talking
[48.36 - 51.96] about
[49.24 - 54.28] Chemtrails you might want to brace
[51.96 - 57.84] yourself for what's coming in this
[54.28 - 61.52] episode it's a powerful episode that you
[57.84 - 63.68] really should be informed wared about
[61.52 - 67.04] it's always about protecting our health
[63.68 - 70.20] in every way possible and chemtrails
[67.04 - 72.72] that's an area we have to cover I have
[70.20 - 75.32] to give you guys a little warning though
[72.72 - 79.28] after you hear this you may never see
[75.32 - 81.64] the sky the same
[79.28 - 85.40] again this is all information from
[81.64 - 88.00] Spirit of compassion since I was a child
[85.40 - 90.32] naysayers they can believe it or not
[88.00 - 92.60] that's fine maybe somebody can call it a
[90.32 - 94.36] Theory look we can call it a spooky
[92.60 - 97.56] Campfire story if it makes people feel
[94.36 - 100.24] good we can do that too that's fine but
[97.56 - 103.20] hey when you hear what I have to say
[100.24 - 104.88] just get ready bottom line you've
[103.20 - 107.60] probably done your research with
[104.88 - 109.20] Chemtrails somebody has somebody must
[107.60 - 110.84] have because there's people out there
[109.20 - 113.08] they're like Chemtrails I know about
[110.84 - 115.44] those and I've heard about those and
[113.08 - 117.72] there's some information out there and
[115.44 - 119.68] yeah some of it's accurate one of the
[117.72 - 122.32] accurate parts of chemtrails is that
[119.68 - 124.80] they there are chemtrails that there
[122.32 - 128.12] actually are chemtrails so I'm going to
[124.80 - 131.08] tell you guys what information isn't out
[128.12 - 133.88] there and it's a lot What Spirit of
[131.08 - 137.48] compassion has told me the Deep secrets
[133.88 - 141.56] of the chemtrail game yeah did you hear
[137.48 - 144.00] that I said game yeah a sick game my
[141.56 - 146.56] first experience with Chemtrails was as
[144.00 - 149.56] a child and a friend of mine pointing
[146.56 - 152.36] out a contrail on the horizon and my
[149.56 - 153.44] friend asking what does your spirit say
[152.36 - 155.60] about this
[153.44 - 157.96] contrail and that's what he said I said
[155.60 - 159.08] well let me ask Spirit of compassion
[157.96 - 162.04] what is a
[159.08 - 163.24] contrail and spirit of compassion said
[162.04 - 167.08] there are
[163.24 - 171.16] contrails and there are man-made poison
[167.08 - 174.08] Trails where man is poisoning man these
[171.16 - 177.68] are two entirely different
[174.08 - 181.20] things ever since then I was intrigued
[177.68 - 185.48] in fact I was obsessed about doubted why
[181.20 - 187.96] on Earth would man be poisoning man that
[185.48 - 189.96] right there when I was young I I I it
[187.96 - 192.44] was overload it was
[189.96 - 196.36] overload why on Earth would man be
[192.44 - 198.68] dumping poison on man that was hard for
[196.36 - 200.88] me to receive as a child because that
[198.68 - 203.08] one right there just it didn't make
[200.88 - 205.24] sense and even though Spirit of
[203.08 - 207.12] compassion delivered me the harsh
[205.24 - 209.52] reality of chronic illness already as a
[207.12 - 211.48] young child teaching me so many of the
[209.52 - 213.16] things things that that I've lectured
[211.48 - 215.44] about over the years that people know
[213.16 - 217.56] about now that has been passed around
[215.44 - 221.08] because the health scene was so small
[217.56 - 223.16] for years ago and all the information
[221.08 - 225.88] that got out there that was so like
[223.16 - 228.72] harsh reality of why women are sick and
[225.88 - 231.84] why men are sick this was a hard one for
[228.72 - 233.76] me it was a hard one when I receiv
[231.84 - 236.32] received this as a child I mean I knew
[233.76 - 239.24] about rat poison I knew about rat poison
[236.32 - 241.20] that kills rats right rat poison I was
[239.24 - 243.04] afraid of of it I was afraid of rat
[241.20 - 246.00] poison you just don't want to play with
[243.04 - 248.40] that stuff I knew about insect poisoning
[246.00 - 251.16] too my neighbors they sprayed out of a
[248.40 - 253.20] can so this prompted me to constantly
[251.16 - 257.52] ask Spirit of compassion what's that
[253.20 - 260.24] Mark in the Sky What's that plane what
[257.52 - 263.36] is that streak in the sky what is what
[260.24 - 265.92] is this and spirit would say that's a
[263.36 - 268.60] passenger plane that's what that is
[265.92 - 270.76] that's a passenger plane and that's a
[268.60 - 273.52] cargo plane there i' be like oh what's
[270.76 - 276.72] that plane you know a couple hours later
[273.52 - 278.96] what is that one you know well that's a
[276.72 - 281.04] third type of plane you got your
[278.96 - 283.32] passenger planes where people are on
[281.04 - 284.96] them you got your cargo planes where
[283.32 - 286.80] they're delivering packages and
[284.96 - 288.56] everything else right and all that and
[286.80 - 291.40] there's other little tiny planes you
[288.56 - 293.64] know that fly around or private planes
[291.40 - 297.76] little ones and all that but big planes
[293.64 - 301.56] I'm talking about big ones and there
[297.76 - 301.56] then there was this third plane
[301.84 - 306.08] and we'll get to that in a little bit
[303.48 - 308.72] about that third plane now there is a
[306.08 - 311.92] big difference between a contrail and
[308.72 - 315.76] what people have named now a
[311.92 - 318.24] chemrail so hey I learned it as manmade
[315.76 - 321.60] poison Trails that's what Spirit of
[318.24 - 323.72] compassion said and now I guess they're
[321.60 - 327.28] called Chemtrails and it's a good name
[323.72 - 330.48] for them too I like that name I do
[327.28 - 333.24] contrails contrails are fuel burning and
[330.48 - 337.24] heat exchanging from a plane it's this
[333.24 - 339.60] heat coming out of engines okay so when
[337.24 - 342.24] you're entering a higher altitude and
[339.60 - 345.64] you got that fuel burning emitting all
[342.24 - 348.52] of that different vapor and that air is
[345.64 - 350.64] cool as that plane is rising and you you
[348.52 - 353.56] can see these contrails out there yeah
[350.64 - 356.24] there's this little tiny streak and you
[353.56 - 359.00] see mostly contrails in the fall
[356.24 - 362.88] contrails in the winter on the horizon
[359.00 - 366.44] of the night sky right on the other hand
[362.88 - 369.08] a chemtrail is something sinister
[366.44 - 372.24] something dark something dark in a
[369.08 - 375.60] Despicable way that's even
[372.24 - 377.80] unimaginable really is it was for me as
[375.60 - 379.60] a child and before I tell you what
[377.80 - 380.52] Spirit of compassion has told me about
[379.60 - 382.64] the
[380.52 - 386.16] Chemtrails I got to bring you back into
[382.64 - 390.80] history a little bit to World War I
[386.16 - 393.24] 1914 okay and the world was at war and a
[390.80 - 395.12] few years before the world was at War a
[393.24 - 396.92] few years in the early 1900s the
[395.12 - 399.20] chemical industry was
[396.92 - 401.84] birthing it was birthing they were
[399.20 - 405.52] experimenting with chemical
[401.84 - 409.56] concoctions it was a brand new industry
[405.52 - 412.40] and fierce at that for industrial use
[409.56 - 415.44] World War I was the money and the fuel
[412.40 - 419.08] for the chemical industry to become
[415.44 - 421.72] larger to ignite to propel it was like
[419.08 - 424.16] the it was like the gasoline on the fire
[421.72 - 427.24] that war for the for the chemical
[424.16 - 429.52] industry so it became larger because the
[427.24 - 433.00] chemical industry was contracted to feed
[429.52 - 435.64] the War Industry the global War Industry
[433.00 - 438.16] they were hired to produce chemicals for
[435.64 - 441.44] chemical warfare and all kinds of other
[438.16 - 445.08] Industries about war and this was all
[441.44 - 448.16] around the world and a surplus of these
[445.08 - 450.76] chemicals were stockpiled storage bins
[448.16 - 454.52] of these chemicals the chemical industry
[450.76 - 457.36] loves War they love insects too now they
[454.52 - 459.24] love rodents they love machines they
[457.36 - 462.12] love anything and they loved all that
[459.24 - 464.76] back then and everything that they
[462.12 - 466.08] believe needs a chemical you might be
[464.76 - 469.68] wondering like why is he talking about
[466.08 - 472.12] World War I yeah yeah I got a real
[469.68 - 473.64] reason and it's a powerful reason to
[472.12 - 475.08] just hang on and when I tell you guys
[473.64 - 477.04] fasten your seat belts like I have in
[475.08 - 479.00] the past you're going to want to fasten
[477.04 - 481.12] your seat bels for this one I mean you
[479.00 - 484.16] really are I I would be sitting down for
[481.12 - 486.68] this show but the war ended early with
[484.16 - 488.08] the help of the Spanish flu right you
[486.68 - 490.96] guys probably know that information
[488.08 - 494.24] there the flu kind of knocked that war
[490.96 - 496.16] down but hey that disappointed the
[494.24 - 498.16] chemical Industries they were hoping the
[496.16 - 500.76] war would last forever but you didn't
[498.16 - 503.64] need a war lasting forever for them this
[500.76 - 506.36] was the true birth of the chemical
[503.64 - 509.72] Industries and it spawned on the birth
[506.36 - 512.28] of all chemicals used in all industri it
[509.72 - 515.48] led to constant production of industrial
[512.28 - 517.24] chemicals all the way to World War II
[515.48 - 519.96] Not only was the chemical industry
[517.24 - 521.80] producing for World War II now but they
[519.96 - 524.60] were producing on a much larger scale
[521.80 - 528.00] for almost all Industries around the
[524.60 - 531.44] world everywhere at that point because
[528.00 - 533.80] of this there was so much overflow of
[531.44 - 535.60] byproduct the industries had to dump
[533.80 - 537.48] some of the chemicals into rivers lakes
[535.60 - 539.52] in the ocean and I'm going to talk about
[537.48 - 542.32] byproduct in a minute what that means
[539.52 - 544.60] byproduct coming off of creating a
[542.32 - 547.60] chemical not just the chemical
[544.60 - 549.84] itself the industries they just dumped
[547.60 - 551.52] it right into rivers they dumped them
[549.84 - 553.44] into lakes they dumped them into the
[551.52 - 555.56] ocean they dumped them everywhere they
[553.44 - 557.92] were they were already doing that since
[555.56 - 560.64] the early 1900s they were already
[557.92 - 563.48] dumping all this stuff everywhere but it
[560.64 - 564.76] was increasing greatly and with more
[563.48 - 567.84] dangerous
[564.76 - 569.92] concoctions the chemical Industries knew
[567.84 - 572.36] if it persisted
[569.92 - 575.40] our lakes and rivers would
[572.36 - 578.76] die they would die and they would die
[575.40 - 582.76] globally and they knew this just like
[578.76 - 586.24] Lake Erie almost was pronounced
[582.76 - 588.00] dead almost pronounced completely dead
[586.24 - 590.16] and when it gets to that point when a
[588.00 - 592.64] lake actually completely dies you can't
[590.16 - 596.56] bring it back so The Dumping of these
[592.64 - 599.44] chemicals slowed down in the 1960s and
[596.56 - 602.08] storage bins and storage bins started to
[599.44 - 604.96] accumulate more and more and more around
[602.08 - 607.04] the world storage bins of chemicals you
[604.96 - 609.88] have to understand something this is
[607.04 - 612.64] important the process of making
[609.88 - 614.84] chemicals is a wasteful process in order
[612.64 - 617.88] to make a chemical for a use there's
[614.84 - 620.76] trial and error they experiment over and
[617.88 - 624.64] over and over again and create bad
[620.76 - 627.56] batches they create mistakes nonstop
[624.64 - 629.72] it's practice is what it is it's
[627.56 - 632.04] practiced mistakes
[629.72 - 635.84] that have to be discarded where does all
[632.04 - 639.92] that practiced mistake go millions and
[635.84 - 643.72] millions and billions of botch jobed
[639.92 - 646.36] gallons have to go somewhere of chemical
[643.72 - 649.24] so not only do you have the mistakes
[646.36 - 652.80] made as they try to discover a chemical
[649.24 - 655.68] for use but the byproduct produced is a
[652.80 - 658.36] whole other level of waste which can
[655.68 - 660.04] lead to millions of gallons on its own
[658.36 - 661.80] hey this might be boring when you think
[660.04 - 663.08] about it to somebody they're like I
[661.80 - 665.12] don't want to hear about chemicals oh
[663.08 - 667.36] yeah you don't you don't okay you don't
[665.12 - 669.28] want to hear about them okay all right
[667.36 - 670.68] okay you okay you live in that world but
[669.28 - 673.56] you know
[670.68 - 675.36] what you want to know you want to know
[673.56 - 677.92] what's happening because it involves you
[675.36 - 680.36] it involves everybody this isn't just a
[677.92 - 683.52] story about some chemicals or something
[680.36 - 685.72] this this is critical information so you
[683.52 - 687.68] can protect your family so you can
[685.72 - 690.88] protect your loved ones and protect
[687.68 - 693.64] yourself the byproduct I'm talking about
[690.88 - 695.60] produced that's a whole another level of
[693.64 - 697.36] waste it's not just the chemical that's
[695.60 - 699.92] being produced but the byproduct which
[697.36 - 702.56] can lead to once again millions and
[699.92 - 705.44] millions and billions of gallons on its
[702.56 - 708.88] own per one
[705.44 - 711.24] chemical now per one chemical they try
[708.88 - 714.00] to deem useful this can mean up to a
[711.24 - 717.72] thousand times the byproduct per
[714.00 - 719.84] chemical produced it could up to that
[717.72 - 722.96] this translates to trillions and
[719.84 - 727.36] trillions of gallons of byproduct over
[722.96 - 731.24] the years what's byproduct deadly waste
[727.36 - 733.48] chemicals you know from a chemical when
[731.24 - 736.72] they're trying to make it that was a
[733.48 - 739.96] method of disposing of the toxic waste
[736.72 - 743.88] the method was throw it in Rivers throw
[739.96 - 746.36] it in Lakes let it drain into lakes let
[743.88 - 748.52] it drain in the ocean but where's it
[746.36 - 751.28] going to go you know in the end with all
[748.52 - 753.36] of that trillions of gallons where is
[751.28 - 757.08] the industry going to store all of those
[753.36 - 759.44] toxic gallons because they back down on
[757.08 - 762.20] dumping it in any streams rivers and
[759.44 - 765.88] lakes and and the ocean back in the 60s
[762.20 - 767.60] it was back down and where do you store
[765.88 - 771.12] all that because it's going to take up
[767.60 - 773.56] so much land in the world so much land
[771.12 - 775.40] in the world massive amounts the old
[773.56 - 777.88] method was to dump it like I said in our
[775.40 - 780.20] rivers and lakes and the other old
[777.88 - 782.68] method was to dump in landfills and
[780.20 - 785.88] toxic dump sites where then the rain
[782.68 - 788.04] would come and the rain would slowly
[785.88 - 790.28] wash small amounts of it back into the
[788.04 - 792.48] ocean back into the rivers and back into
[790.28 - 795.32] the Lakes this has been ongoing since
[792.48 - 797.40] the early 1900s it was the older method
[795.32 - 800.76] I'm talking about to discard it and get
[797.40 - 803.72] rid of it but you'll see why I'm talking
[800.76 - 806.40] about this as we move along the global
[803.72 - 809.04] chemic you know chemical Industries had
[806.40 - 810.48] a problem on their hands they couldn't
[809.04 - 812.56] dump it all in the rivers oceans and
[810.48 - 814.76] lakes not all of it and there was
[812.56 - 816.96] nowhere to store the mass amounts
[814.76 - 819.28] anymore there wasn't enough land
[816.96 - 822.60] available to store the surplus of
[819.28 - 826.80] chemicals and the excess byproduct it
[822.60 - 830.32] would take over planet Earth we're
[826.80 - 834.04] talking about levels that are so huge
[830.32 - 837.76] and so massive Unthinkable levels and
[834.04 - 839.28] amounts and different kinds of chemicals
[837.76 - 842.40] thousands of different kinds of
[839.28 - 844.80] chemicals and their byproducts before we
[842.40 - 847.68] go further though we will talk about
[844.80 - 850.72] those planes we see in the air so now
[847.68 - 852.16] there's airliners right hey they have
[850.72 - 853.92] passengers you guys have been on those
[852.16 - 856.48] planes before they got passengers you're
[853.92 - 860.08] flying all flying up there and then
[856.48 - 862.24] there's cargo planes and they might have
[860.08 - 865.04] a couple of P passengers on there but
[862.24 - 867.80] they have you know packages and
[865.04 - 869.64] shipments and carrying packages all
[867.80 - 871.84] around the globe
[869.64 - 875.00] but there's another kind of large plane
[871.84 - 876.84] up there Spirit of compassion told me
[875.00 - 879.36] about it it's separate from the other
[876.84 - 881.20] two kinds of planes I just mentioned
[879.36 - 884.44] these are older
[881.20 - 887.64] airliners they're older airliners these
[884.44 - 892.72] airliners are from the late 50s and the
[887.64 - 896.00] 60s and the 70s and the 80s and the '90s
[892.72 - 899.92] these different kind of planes people
[896.00 - 902.92] used to travel in them yeah airliners is
[899.92 - 906.04] what they were but not anymore they fly
[902.92 - 909.00] with no passengers on there anymore
[906.04 - 912.12] those days are over they travel on their
[909.00 - 914.44] own flight patterns and they land in
[912.12 - 916.52] private airports their own private
[914.44 - 918.68] airports these private airports aren't
[916.52 - 920.08] military they have nothing to do with
[918.68 - 922.84] any world
[920.08 - 924.52] military and you know what's really
[922.84 - 925.60] weird they have nothing to do with any
[924.52 - 927.92] world
[925.60 - 929.44] governments it's a whole other
[927.92 - 932.52] organization
[929.44 - 934.68] built for the chemical
[932.52 - 937.72] Industries
[934.68 - 940.00] and I should have my flashl shining on
[937.72 - 942.60] my face right now as we sit around the
[940.00 - 945.32] campfire you know get ready for the
[942.60 - 947.48] information though and a whole other
[945.32 - 950.28] organization of private contractors
[947.48 - 952.44] built this for the chemical
[950.28 - 953.76] Industries I always tell you guys about
[952.44 - 955.32] the private deals that Spirit of
[953.76 - 957.24] compassion has told me about all through
[955.32 - 959.60] the years I tell you about the private
[957.24 - 962.76] deals going on here's just another one
[959.60 - 965.32] to add to the list right a private deal
[962.76 - 968.96] that was put in place in the
[965.32 - 971.04] 1960s made without anybody's say or
[968.96 - 972.52] input no Town Hall meetings like always
[971.04 - 974.80] say it's kind of reminds me of the just
[972.52 - 976.24] like just like the protein law hey if
[974.80 - 977.92] you're new to Medical medium information
[976.24 - 979.24] you be like what's the protein law well
[977.92 - 982.24] the protein law is something you've been
[979.24 - 984.40] brainwashed with okay just so you know
[982.24 - 987.04] all right back in the early
[984.40 - 989.28] 1930s the the whole thing about protein
[987.04 - 990.76] was purposely done and it was in it was
[989.28 - 993.28] put into schools and all of this
[990.76 - 994.64] information about I can give you that
[993.28 - 996.04] another day you're going to hear about
[994.64 - 997.88] the protein law and you'll know why
[996.04 - 1000.40] you've been brainwashed by the protein
[997.88 - 1003.56] law but and then there's the autoimmune
[1000.40 - 1005.96] law too where we've been trained that
[1003.56 - 1007.60] our bodies attack themselves that we're
[1005.96 - 1009.28] taught that our body turns against our
[1007.60 - 1010.68] glands and organs and our body's immune
[1009.28 - 1013.36] system destroys itself right the
[1010.68 - 1014.80] autoimmune law that started in the 1950s
[1013.36 - 1016.96] that private deal that was made that
[1014.80 - 1018.48] everybody's brainwashed about to
[1016.96 - 1020.52] alternative medicine and conventional
[1018.48 - 1023.40] medicine well we'll talk about those in
[1020.52 - 1026.12] future episodes but this was another
[1023.40 - 1029.48] private deal that was made these old
[1026.12 - 1032.44] planes were hollowed out tanks were put
[1029.48 - 1036.12] inside of them and not the tanks that
[1032.44 - 1037.68] are theorized now not the tanks they cuz
[1036.12 - 1040.80] you know people talk about there must be
[1037.68 - 1043.48] tanks in these planes right but these
[1040.80 - 1047.48] tanks are large tanks not little tiny
[1043.48 - 1049.64] ones they're large tanks and the these
[1047.48 - 1052.68] planes are gutted and these large
[1049.64 - 1055.80] plastic tanks are installed the tanks
[1052.68 - 1058.24] were filled with old chemicals and their
[1055.80 - 1062.36] byproducts that's what happens so the
[1058.24 - 1065.28] plane is sitting there a truck comes by
[1062.36 - 1066.72] and then fills the plane up with these
[1065.28 - 1069.20] toxic waste
[1066.72 - 1071.12] chemicals that's how the system works
[1069.20 - 1073.28] the planes land once they empty the
[1071.12 - 1075.64] chemicals they land they're in the
[1073.28 - 1078.24] airport trucks come by they fill up the
[1075.64 - 1079.72] tanks planes take off it's and they they
[1078.24 - 1082.80] go out and they're just they're up in
[1079.72 - 1085.88] the air again so the global chemical
[1082.80 - 1089.72] industry was was harboring for over 50
[1085.88 - 1091.44] years since before the 1960s all these
[1089.72 - 1093.64] toxic chemicals that that they've been
[1091.44 - 1095.68] holding on to because if they dumped
[1093.64 - 1098.20] everything in the rivers and the lakes
[1095.68 - 1100.08] and the ocean at once and in landfills
[1098.20 - 1102.60] throughout the throughout the whole
[1100.08 - 1105.60] 1900s and early 1900s it would have been
[1102.60 - 1107.64] epic disaster an epic disaster so many
[1105.60 - 1111.36] of the chemicals were held on to and
[1107.64 - 1115.08] kept in store Vats the plan was to fill
[1111.36 - 1117.60] these planes with these chemicals and
[1115.08 - 1121.52] release them when the planes are up in
[1117.60 - 1124.68] the sky you know is that a nice thing to
[1121.52 - 1128.64] do I don't think so the planes go high
[1124.68 - 1131.76] in the sky and they release these toxic
[1128.64 - 1134.72] chemicals so it would slowly thin out
[1131.76 - 1137.24] over time as these chemicals
[1134.72 - 1139.76] dissipated this isn't in just one
[1137.24 - 1142.28] country okay okay so if you're thinking
[1139.76 - 1144.88] that in your mind you're like whoa what
[1142.28 - 1146.12] country he's talking about no no a
[1144.88 - 1150.20] global
[1146.12 - 1154.28] phenomenon a global deal the planes are
[1150.20 - 1157.80] flying all over the entire planet
[1154.28 - 1159.48] dropping down these chemicals and
[1157.80 - 1163.20] chemical
[1159.48 - 1166.60] byproduct these old storage Vats of
[1163.20 - 1169.84] chemicals that all these chemical
[1166.60 - 1172.04] Industries had sitting around too too
[1169.84 - 1173.56] long something happens to these
[1172.04 - 1176.44] chemicals when they sit around too too
[1173.56 - 1180.56] long on another note things grow inside
[1176.44 - 1185.28] of them strange forms of bacteria
[1180.56 - 1186.80] strange forms of mold fungus toxic algae
[1185.28 - 1189.52] and that's something you got to remember
[1186.80 - 1192.32] as we go through the show toxic algae
[1189.52 - 1194.52] interesting you know like red tide kind
[1192.32 - 1197.24] of stuff we're going to keep on moving
[1194.52 - 1199.68] along new allergens we never even
[1197.24 - 1203.20] experience grow in these
[1199.68 - 1206.56] tanks this is why the oceans get those
[1203.20 - 1209.24] algae blooms that actually cause the red
[1206.56 - 1211.44] tide by the way these red tides are a
[1209.24 - 1214.28] sign of the coming times down down down
[1211.44 - 1217.56] the road okay and you know long after
[1214.28 - 1220.88] we're here but these coming times where
[1217.56 - 1223.00] the oceans die and turn completely red
[1220.88 - 1225.92] you know the chemicals are
[1223.00 - 1230.32] producing the over production of the
[1225.92 - 1232.40] toxic algae that's what happens the
[1230.32 - 1236.36] chemicals that are being dropped out of
[1232.40 - 1237.44] the sky are igniting and proliferating
[1236.36 - 1240.80] toxic
[1237.44 - 1243.28] algae because that's where the toxic
[1240.80 - 1245.28] algae are coming from see we kind of
[1243.28 - 1247.32] play stupid down here we're like testing
[1245.28 - 1248.92] water we're testing red tide certain
[1247.32 - 1250.96] times of the Season hey it's dangerous
[1248.92 - 1252.80] to go in the water don't go in that
[1250.96 - 1255.12] water right now you might get sick you
[1252.80 - 1257.64] know we're doing little tests on it but
[1255.12 - 1261.00] that toxic algae comes from someplace it
[1257.64 - 1264.20] didn't come come from down here that
[1261.00 - 1265.68] toxic algae came from up there and
[1264.20 - 1269.76] rained
[1265.68 - 1272.64] down that's how it works see you get
[1269.76 - 1274.84] microorganisms they have to survive they
[1272.64 - 1277.60] need to survive and when they sit in
[1274.84 - 1281.32] these chemical soups in Vats and storage
[1277.60 - 1284.32] bins for years and decades they adapt
[1281.32 - 1288.72] the more microorganisms then breed life
[1284.32 - 1290.64] in there and then they have to adapt to
[1288.72 - 1292.12] survive and that's going to be a whole
[1290.64 - 1294.12] story for another day on know how that
[1292.12 - 1296.68] works but let's just keep
[1294.12 - 1299.32] going but what you see is not what you
[1296.68 - 1302.28] get up there in the sky when you look at
[1299.32 - 1304.16] the Chemtrails in the sky you might be
[1302.28 - 1305.92] thinking oh wow that chemtrail now he's
[1304.16 - 1308.88] talking about that chem trol is going to
[1305.92 - 1310.60] fall on me I see that one right up there
[1308.88 - 1312.00] that one's going to fall on me hey look
[1310.60 - 1313.52] there's another one right there hey look
[1312.00 - 1316.48] there's 10 over there those guy those
[1313.52 - 1317.84] chem trolls are going to hit me now no
[1316.48 - 1319.84] this is a good piece of information to
[1317.84 - 1323.16] know know the Chemtrails you see are not
[1319.84 - 1326.68] coming down on you they're not if you
[1323.16 - 1328.16] can see it it's not coming down on you
[1326.68 - 1330.96] they're coming down on somebody else
[1328.16 - 1332.92] miles away the chemtrail that comes down
[1330.96 - 1335.88] in you you can't see it's already come
[1332.92 - 1338.48] down it's already been heading down and
[1335.88 - 1341.32] comes down they float through the sky
[1338.48 - 1343.00] and they dissipate and they drop miles
[1341.32 - 1345.32] after miles after miles and they fall
[1343.00 - 1348.80] down on somebody else the ones you see
[1345.32 - 1351.40] in the sky anyway so the planes they
[1348.80 - 1354.84] drop these chemical soups all day all
[1351.40 - 1359.16] night non-stop but non-stop all night
[1354.84 - 1362.12] all day all night all day chemical
[1359.16 - 1364.16] byproducts are forever being produced by
[1362.12 - 1365.88] the chemical industry if you're
[1364.16 - 1367.68] wondering what byproduct I'm talking
[1365.88 - 1369.60] about it's endless really I mean it's
[1367.68 - 1372.40] endless so many things that are man-made
[1369.60 - 1374.08] out there they prod everything man-made
[1372.40 - 1377.12] produces chemical
[1374.08 - 1378.96] byproduct from many Industries including
[1377.12 - 1381.80] the petrochemical Industries throughout
[1378.96 - 1384.96] the world the entire world the byproduct
[1381.80 - 1386.68] is highly toxic and it can't be dumped
[1384.96 - 1388.36] in the ocean like I said in one shot you
[1386.68 - 1391.56] dump all this in the ocean in one shot
[1388.36 - 1393.64] shot you guys and the ocean's dead
[1391.56 - 1396.20] that's it every the whales die
[1393.64 - 1398.72] everything dies that would happen you
[1396.20 - 1400.76] dump all this stuff if all the if the
[1398.72 - 1403.08] chemical industry opened up the
[1400.76 - 1405.40] floodgates and let everything roll into
[1403.08 - 1407.28] the ocean at once all their backlog
[1405.40 - 1410.24] their trillions of gallons the ocean
[1407.28 - 1414.36] would die and one shot and turn deep red
[1410.24 - 1417.24] blood red and every single dolphin would
[1414.36 - 1419.28] die you know a fraction of this
[1417.24 - 1421.12] byproduct just a fraction of this
[1419.28 - 1423.96] byproduct I'm talking about sent down a
[1421.12 - 1425.56] major river would kill the entire River
[1423.96 - 1428.16] and all the foliage and plant life
[1425.56 - 1431.36] within the river and around
[1428.16 - 1434.04] it it has to be dropped
[1431.36 - 1435.28] strategically the chemicals have to be
[1434.04 - 1438.40] dropped
[1435.28 - 1442.24] strategically out of ples in our
[1438.40 - 1445.40] atmosphere to thin out and spaced out
[1442.24 - 1448.68] enough so it doesn't show the immediate
[1445.40 - 1452.16] harm on our environment and
[1448.68 - 1455.24] nature Spirit of compassion says to me
[1452.16 - 1457.68] and always has the plan is as you drop
[1455.24 - 1459.68] it slowly Spirit of compassion told me
[1457.68 - 1461.84] as you drop it slowly out of the sky it
[1459.68 - 1464.24] gives our oceans rivers and lakes and
[1461.84 - 1468.52] forests time to
[1464.24 - 1469.80] adapt I always that always blew my mind
[1468.52 - 1472.60] Spirit of compassion would say it
[1469.80 - 1476.36] lessens the shock on the environment it
[1472.60 - 1479.60] gives everything a chance to
[1476.36 - 1482.76] adapt and that was wild to me that was
[1479.60 - 1486.36] wild the other plan was for some of it
[1482.76 - 1489.20] to stay in the clouds intermix with
[1486.36 - 1492.12] precipitation and becom somewhat
[1489.20 - 1496.12] diffused by The Living Water that's rain
[1492.12 - 1499.04] rain's rain's electric it's electric
[1496.12 - 1502.20] that's what rain is it's got a charge to
[1499.04 - 1504.28] it and that living water that charge
[1502.20 - 1507.72] that was that was part of the plan that
[1504.28 - 1510.92] it could diffuse some of it so the plan
[1507.72 - 1514.64] was hopefully it stays in a lot of
[1510.92 - 1519.60] clouds you've heard about acid rain
[1514.64 - 1521.84] right acid rain H you know the thing
[1519.60 - 1524.52] that everybody says smog is the culprit
[1521.84 - 1526.52] for but there's much more than that it's
[1524.52 - 1529.24] much more than just
[1526.52 - 1531.84] smog it's it's a lot to do with the
[1529.24 - 1534.00] Chemtrails because the Chemtrails a lot
[1531.84 - 1536.48] of it a decent amount of it does stay up
[1534.00 - 1538.04] there and it eventually comes down in
[1536.48 - 1541.84] the
[1538.04 - 1543.44] rain I talked about rain being toxic and
[1541.84 - 1544.92] you don't want if you're somebody that's
[1543.44 - 1546.16] sick and you got symptoms and you're
[1544.92 - 1548.36] hypers sensitive you don't want to be
[1546.16 - 1550.00] drenched by the rain all the time
[1548.36 - 1554.48] because he might feel a little sick and
[1550.00 - 1556.20] a little sicker along the way you know
[1554.48 - 1559.92] look
[1556.20 - 1564.28] Chemtrails is why our skies aren't blue
[1559.92 - 1567.20] anymore okay and they're hazy blue the
[1564.28 - 1570.16] chemicals that stay in the air and hover
[1567.20 - 1572.16] before they even drop change the color
[1570.16 - 1574.64] color of our Sky look you might be
[1572.16 - 1577.16] somebody that's young and when you're
[1574.64 - 1580.24] young you just think this guy is as blue
[1577.16 - 1583.08] as it is and that's it but when you talk
[1580.24 - 1586.12] to older people like older people
[1583.08 - 1588.32] they're like they know what a deep blue
[1586.12 - 1590.48] sky looks like
[1588.32 - 1593.96] you know photographs from our skies you
[1590.48 - 1596.44] guys in the 1940s and the 1950s and
[1593.96 - 1599.84] early 1960s are vastly different than
[1596.44 - 1601.76] are photographs today of a sky unless
[1599.84 - 1603.52] you put filters on them and photoshoop
[1601.76 - 1607.12] them and change the colors with your
[1603.52 - 1610.64] computer right what a game that is
[1607.12 - 1614.56] unbelievable hiding the sky we mostly
[1610.64 - 1619.40] have Misty baby blue skies now not rich
[1614.56 - 1622.56] Clear Blue Skies we have become the frog
[1619.40 - 1625.76] in a pot of boiling water in some
[1622.56 - 1628.68] respects each new generation doesn't
[1625.76 - 1633.24] know how rich and clear and blue the sky
[1628.68 - 1636.16] was in the past you are born and raised
[1633.24 - 1638.64] with the new Sky we have which is all
[1636.16 - 1640.32] you know just like the frog doesn't know
[1638.64 - 1642.36] the temperature of the water is getting
[1640.32 - 1645.68] hot until it's too late we don't know
[1642.36 - 1645.68] the skies are becoming less
[1645.76 - 1652.36] blue when the chemtrails accumulate they
[1648.96 - 1655.04] Shadow areas of the world wreaking havoc
[1652.36 - 1656.80] on Epic levels because of the drowning
[1655.04 - 1660.96] out of our
[1656.80 - 1662.68] sun it changes the weather it does
[1660.96 - 1665.08] interesting it changes the weather our
[1662.68 - 1667.32] weather has changed our climate has
[1665.08 - 1669.52] changed because of chem
[1667.32 - 1672.40] trails and I'm not talking about the
[1669.52 - 1674.76] cloud seeding trail that is known or the
[1672.40 - 1676.76] cloud seeding technique that is known
[1674.76 - 1678.92] where they use barium and other
[1676.76 - 1681.20] substances to manipulate
[1678.92 - 1683.52] precipitation Chemtrails is a whole
[1681.20 - 1684.48] other thing going on it's separate from
[1683.52 - 1686.84] cloud
[1684.48 - 1690.12] seeding that's a whole another point to
[1686.84 - 1693.04] know the Chemtrails they cause droughts
[1690.12 - 1695.36] in places that shouldn't have droughts
[1693.04 - 1698.08] they can cause more rain in areas it
[1695.36 - 1699.96] shouldn't Chemtrails interferes with
[1698.08 - 1703.20] weather patterns because the chemicals
[1699.96 - 1705.56] Harbor metals and metals interfere with
[1703.20 - 1707.84] electrical activities of our skies
[1705.56 - 1710.00] because our skies are electrical it
[1707.84 - 1712.68] creates storms where storms shouldn't be
[1710.00 - 1716.48] created it even manipulates hurricanes
[1712.68 - 1721.28] Cyclones and tornadoes but even worse
[1716.48 - 1723.32] our polar caps are melting because of
[1721.28 - 1725.52] chemtrails I don't think you guys saw
[1723.32 - 1726.84] that one coming right because I know
[1725.52 - 1728.56] there's a lot of polar cap people that
[1726.84 - 1729.88] are worried and you're just like oh my
[1728.56 - 1731.68] God the polar caps are melting there's a
[1729.88 - 1733.32] lot of people out there like I can ask
[1731.68 - 1734.76] that I get asked all kinds of questions
[1733.32 - 1736.40] I got friends that ask me questions all
[1734.76 - 1738.04] through the years I mean you wouldn't
[1736.40 - 1739.32] believe what people ask me when when
[1738.04 - 1740.64] they know me they'll be like look tell
[1739.32 - 1743.92] me tell me the hard truth about
[1740.64 - 1747.72] something I'll be like what
[1743.92 - 1749.20] what and the polar caps yeah and it
[1747.72 - 1750.84] causes the waters to rise yeah is the
[1749.20 - 1753.36] waters Rising yeah they're Rising ever
[1750.84 - 1755.04] so slow slowly but they're Rising but
[1753.36 - 1757.04] the Chemtrails are the true reason why
[1755.04 - 1759.00] the waters are rising at all not the
[1757.04 - 1760.88] fake reason which is just smug and
[1759.00 - 1763.44] animal pollution and people pollution
[1760.88 - 1765.88] those are bad don't get me wrong smog is
[1763.44 - 1768.48] terrible pollution's bad but they're
[1765.88 - 1770.84] nothing like chemtrails
[1768.48 - 1773.12] here's the the strange thing about
[1770.84 - 1775.56] Chemtrails governments have nothing to
[1773.12 - 1777.36] do with Chemtrails World governments all
[1775.56 - 1779.60] around all around the planet have
[1777.36 - 1782.56] nothing to do with the Chemtrails how
[1779.60 - 1785.36] weird is that and they have no power to
[1782.56 - 1787.12] stop them either or even understand them
[1785.36 - 1789.68] it's a private
[1787.12 - 1791.16] club and the power behind this club is
[1789.68 - 1792.56] like no other governments have to
[1791.16 - 1793.80] pretend it's not happening like they
[1792.56 - 1796.76] just whistle
[1793.80 - 1799.12] like no that's not happening nope nope I
[1796.76 - 1800.68] don't see you know I don't see any
[1799.12 - 1804.16] trails in this guy I don't know what
[1800.68 - 1806.48] that is they got to pretend it doesn't
[1804.16 - 1808.12] exist you know what's funny too is it
[1806.48 - 1810.68] makes the pharmaceutical industry look
[1808.12 - 1813.88] like friendly happy and
[1810.68 - 1815.64] safe makes big Pharma look like awesome
[1813.88 - 1817.68] just like they've never done wrong they
[1815.64 - 1819.72] can't do wrong big farm is like
[1817.68 - 1822.32] incredible they can't do no wrong ever
[1819.72 - 1826.12] with anything you know how do you solve
[1822.32 - 1829.16] a problem that no one really knows about
[1826.12 - 1831.20] how do you solve a problem that is above
[1829.16 - 1833.80] all
[1831.20 - 1836.28] laws how do you solve a problem that's
[1833.80 - 1839.04] Global I can't solve the problem I can't
[1836.28 - 1842.16] get people off of
[1839.04 - 1843.84] eggs I can't get people off of eggs eggs
[1842.16 - 1845.48] that are feeding the viruses that are
[1843.84 - 1847.40] responsible for chronic fatigue and all
[1845.48 - 1849.40] their other symptoms and conditions you
[1847.40 - 1852.56] know eggs being one of the things that
[1849.40 - 1853.76] actually feed bugs and then the bugs are
[1852.56 - 1856.72] responsible these viruses are
[1853.76 - 1857.92] responsible so I can't get people off of
[1856.72 - 1860.12] eggs I can't can't get people off of
[1857.92 - 1862.96] nutritional yeast all that MSG they
[1860.12 - 1865.68] don't know they're eating so I know I
[1862.96 - 1868.20] can't solve this problem I can't Spirit
[1865.68 - 1870.60] of compassion told me when I was young
[1868.20 - 1872.92] that the man poison
[1870.60 - 1875.20] Club is an evil
[1872.92 - 1877.60] machine from what I learned from Spirit
[1875.20 - 1880.00] of compassion you don't stop it and you
[1877.60 - 1883.12] don't fight it cuz you'll never
[1880.00 - 1886.64] win at least not that
[1883.12 - 1888.80] way you have to accept it and then you
[1886.64 - 1891.96] rise above it Spirit of compassion told
[1888.80 - 1894.76] me you rise above it why am I talking
[1891.96 - 1896.44] about this now you know and I waited for
[1894.76 - 1898.20] years well you know I'm always focused
[1896.44 - 1900.64] on you guys with chronic illness and all
[1898.20 - 1902.64] the symptoms and conditions and hundreds
[1900.64 - 1905.04] of symptoms and conditions that medical
[1902.64 - 1907.40] medium information has reversed and
[1905.04 - 1909.00] saved lives for so many years and then
[1907.40 - 1911.08] the Advanced Medical information
[1909.00 - 1913.80] Alternative Health that that that Spirit
[1911.08 - 1915.68] of compassion put out there for years A
[1913.80 - 1917.24] lot of it that goes right back to me
[1915.68 - 1919.72] some of it that got lost in the wood
[1917.24 - 1921.68] work out there and people use little
[1919.72 - 1924.52] tidbits from Spirit of compassion and
[1921.68 - 1926.84] don't even know where it comes from but
[1924.52 - 1929.12] out of all that you know I'm always
[1926.84 - 1931.24] focused on getting you guys better and
[1929.12 - 1933.28] well I waited for years for somebody
[1931.24 - 1934.92] else to discover what was really going
[1933.28 - 1936.52] on and it's kind of that thing where I
[1934.92 - 1938.36] bring out all those hard truths about
[1936.52 - 1940.04] the caffeine industry and I bring out
[1938.36 - 1941.72] the truth about autoimmune and I bring
[1940.04 - 1944.04] out the truth about how to heal in the
[1941.72 - 1946.00] viruses and what viruses and how they
[1944.04 - 1948.28] been have how they've been let out in
[1946.00 - 1949.52] our environment all these decades and
[1948.28 - 1950.92] why people are sick with chronic
[1949.52 - 1952.52] symptoms and conditions I bring out all
[1950.92 - 1954.36] these truths that no one brings out in
[1952.52 - 1956.76] alternative movement on any
[1954.36 - 1959.56] level or conventional movement on any
[1956.76 - 1960.96] level I'm busy with all that so I just
[1959.56 - 1962.76] kind of sat back and I'm like you know
[1960.96 - 1964.60] what I mean someone's got to figure this
[1962.76 - 1967.52] out I I can't do it
[1964.60 - 1969.16] all I can't do it all I can't just I
[1967.52 - 1970.96] mean I have so much on my plate to
[1969.16 - 1972.52] deliver out there so you would think by
[1970.96 - 1974.76] now someone could have had figured it
[1972.52 - 1976.48] out or what's really going on but it's
[1974.76 - 1978.68] above anything we understand so I
[1976.48 - 1980.12] understand why they have haven't I mean
[1978.68 - 1981.24] look I have to get the information from
[1980.12 - 1983.80] Spirit of
[1981.24 - 1985.44] compassion and look if you're an asay or
[1983.80 - 1986.88] somebody call it a theory if you want if
[1985.44 - 1988.44] that makes you feel good if somebody
[1986.88 - 1990.48] else call it make believe if you want if
[1988.44 - 1993.12] it makes you feel good whatever whatever
[1990.48 - 1996.28] works but here's the
[1993.12 - 1999.16] problem it's going to get worse and
[1996.28 - 2000.84] worse and worse over time the amount of
[1999.16 - 2003.24] planes that have been increased just in
[2000.84 - 2006.56] the last 30 years is
[2003.24 - 2010.08] remarkable remarkable The Fleets are
[2006.56 - 2013.60] Mass and growing larger and they run all
[2010.08 - 2015.20] day and all night and they never stop
[2013.60 - 2018.56] that's how much
[2015.20 - 2021.44] chemical is being poured on
[2018.56 - 2025.00] everyone in the future you won't really
[2021.44 - 2027.16] see a video on any reality TV show or a
[2025.00 - 2031.08] video or photograph on someone's social
[2027.16 - 2033.48] media page with a sky free of
[2031.08 - 2035.84] chemtrails contrails don't leave a Long
[2033.48 - 2037.96] Trail they dissipate fast and it only
[2035.84 - 2042.00] extends the small distance from the jet
[2037.96 - 2045.44] engines Chemtrails go for a long long
[2042.00 - 2048.16] way they can go for miles and miles as
[2045.44 - 2050.04] the planes are flying the pilot slips a
[2048.16 - 2051.96] he flips a
[2050.04 - 2053.96] switch so that's what happens there's
[2051.96 - 2055.40] this pilot on the plane he's got a
[2053.96 - 2058.12] switch to his side and he clicks the
[2055.40 - 2060.92] button he just he's he flips the switch
[2058.12 - 2064.36] and then the pump goes on so there's a
[2060.92 - 2066.68] pump going to the tanks and so the pump
[2064.36 - 2068.60] turns on and it pumps the stuff out of
[2066.68 - 2071.60] the tanks the chemicals out of the tanks
[2068.60 - 2074.04] while the plane is flying and then
[2071.60 - 2076.32] spouts on the side of the plane that are
[2074.04 - 2079.36] bolted to the sides of the plane because
[2076.32 - 2082.28] they're fabricated and built that way
[2079.36 - 2084.24] and these these these jets these spout
[2082.28 - 2086.28] Jets on the side of the plane release
[2084.24 - 2089.04] the chemical as the pump is pumping it
[2086.28 - 2091.00] out of the big tanks and
[2089.04 - 2092.88] then and then the chemical comes
[2091.00 - 2094.60] shooting out of the spouts attached to
[2092.88 - 2098.00] the plane sometimes you'll see a trail
[2094.60 - 2102.24] go on for Miles right and and then it'll
[2098.00 - 2104.28] stop 10 Mi later you'll see the It Go On
[2102.24 - 2106.92] Again meaning you'll see the trail start
[2104.28 - 2109.16] again the pilot is actually switching a
[2106.92 - 2113.04] switch on and
[2109.16 - 2115.52] off at the Pilot's own discretion some
[2113.04 - 2117.76] Pilots go 20 miles before they switch it
[2115.52 - 2119.68] on and off no Rhyme or Reason in many
[2117.76 - 2122.76] cases it depends on what mood the
[2119.68 - 2125.12] Pilot's in or maybe the Pilot's new to
[2122.76 - 2130.04] it all it's first time on the job and he
[2125.12 - 2132.92] releases it all at once and then lands
[2130.04 - 2136.40] empty the the Pilot's job is to spread
[2132.92 - 2139.08] it on and off through the whole duration
[2136.40 - 2141.64] of that flight people who are aware of
[2139.08 - 2144.48] chemrail think that it comes out of the
[2141.64 - 2146.24] engines like they think that's must be
[2144.48 - 2148.28] where the trail is coming from it
[2146.24 - 2150.28] doesn't come out of the engines that's
[2148.28 - 2152.60] not the fuel burning that's not what
[2150.28 - 2155.24] that is Spirit of compassion fills me in
[2152.60 - 2157.08] on these techniques and look you can
[2155.24 - 2159.36] witness some of this yourself if if you
[2157.08 - 2160.48] pay attention and you look up at the sky
[2159.36 - 2161.44] but I know a lot of people they're
[2160.48 - 2163.92] they're a little too busy and they're
[2161.44 - 2166.88] not looking at the sky at all what's
[2163.92 - 2169.88] interesting about Chemtrails is that the
[2166.88 - 2172.60] activity of chemtrails is heightened in
[2169.88 - 2174.84] areas where people will be outside more
[2172.60 - 2177.84] you know during holidays and Gatherings
[2174.84 - 2179.72] and vacation times of the year or when
[2177.84 - 2182.48] people are just outside more when the
[2179.72 - 2184.96] weather's really good and that's when
[2182.48 - 2186.44] more activities happening not because
[2184.96 - 2190.36] people are there and they're seeing it
[2186.44 - 2192.84] not at all and that's not it but way
[2190.36 - 2196.80] more activity more Chemtrails are being
[2192.84 - 2198.28] dropped everywhere covering Skies when
[2196.80 - 2201.16] people are out
[2198.28 - 2203.12] more it's gone beyond the process of
[2201.16 - 2206.24] getting rid of just chemicals and
[2203.12 - 2208.96] byproduct um spirit and compassion
[2206.24 - 2210.84] filled me in that there might have been
[2208.96 - 2212.32] maybe the first intention originally
[2210.84 - 2213.36] which is get rid of the byproduct get
[2212.32 - 2215.68] rid of the
[2213.36 - 2217.24] chemicals that was the safest way
[2215.68 - 2219.00] someone thought the problem could be
[2217.24 - 2222.12] dealt with and you know what maybe there
[2219.00 - 2224.04] was a little bit of Innocence originally
[2222.12 - 2226.64] with the problem maybe at the very
[2224.04 - 2229.08] beginning in the 60s someone was worried
[2226.64 - 2231.16] about dumping everything directly in the
[2229.08 - 2233.68] Lakes because the demand the chemical
[2231.16 - 2235.44] industry was so you know strong and they
[2233.68 - 2237.56] were thinking maybe this was the best
[2235.44 - 2239.96] idea as you put it up in planes and you
[2237.56 - 2242.12] slowly drop it out and maybe they had a
[2239.96 - 2245.00] good think tank with it too a lot of big
[2242.12 - 2247.92] thinkers but I think there could be a
[2245.00 - 2250.76] second intention you know the fact that
[2247.92 - 2253.72] they drop more of it when everybody's
[2250.76 - 2256.20] around Spirit of compassion told me that
[2253.72 - 2259.16] it's possible that yeah there's a second
[2256.20 - 2261.32] intention that developed because
[2259.16 - 2264.04] whenever the weather is nice like I said
[2261.32 - 2268.64] holidays around the world and so forth
[2264.04 - 2271.36] it act the activity increases
[2268.64 - 2273.76] greatly areas are strategically mapped
[2271.36 - 2276.88] out all around the world there is a
[2273.76 - 2278.60] method to this madness you guys there's
[2276.88 - 2281.12] a method to this madness it's the
[2278.60 - 2283.44] ultimate trick played upon us so you're
[2281.12 - 2285.68] taking your selfie you have the sky
[2283.44 - 2286.80] behind you and there's a streak going
[2285.68 - 2289.44] across the
[2286.80 - 2292.16] sky it's something I've learned to
[2289.44 - 2294.88] accept throughout the decades in my life
[2292.16 - 2298.32] as I look up and I see them all that
[2294.88 - 2300.68] there's no fixing it it's one example of
[2298.32 - 2302.88] how we have a spiritual war happening
[2300.68 - 2305.16] you you might have heard me mention
[2302.88 - 2306.36] spiritual war recently I'm going to be
[2305.16 - 2307.96] talking about that more and more and
[2306.36 - 2311.12] more more what's happening it's good
[2307.96 - 2312.24] versus evil oh wait wait you might be
[2311.12 - 2313.80] somebody that doesn't think there's
[2312.24 - 2315.24] anything bad going on you might be
[2313.80 - 2318.12] somebody that doesn't think there's evil
[2315.24 - 2320.64] on any level and you think maybe
[2318.12 - 2322.92] everybody has a good heart you know or
[2320.64 - 2324.88] everybody's just kind of misdirected but
[2322.92 - 2327.20] they're really good inside and they do
[2324.88 - 2331.32] bad things and no there's there's
[2327.20 - 2332.56] Darkness there is there is you know to
[2331.32 - 2335.56] be more
[2332.56 - 2338.12] precise hey evil tricking the good how
[2335.56 - 2340.12] about that instead of good versus evil
[2338.12 - 2343.44] evil tricking the good so the good
[2340.12 - 2345.56] doesn't even know there is a fight one
[2343.44 - 2347.36] of the examples of how we have evil
[2345.56 - 2350.04] people in the world using their Free
[2347.36 - 2352.48] Will well this is definitely one of
[2350.04 - 2354.88] those examples of people doing evil
[2352.48 - 2356.68] things it's a prime example of how
[2354.88 - 2358.68] things aren't what they seem to be and
[2356.68 - 2360.68] we stay distracted on other
[2358.68 - 2362.76] environmental projects and I wonder if
[2360.68 - 2364.76] you're thinking about that a little bit
[2362.76 - 2367.40] while this thing that I'm talking about
[2364.76 - 2370.76] here the chemtrail Saga the chemtrail
[2367.40 - 2373.12] game well this one is completely ignored
[2370.76 - 2376.28] organizations that are formed to protect
[2373.12 - 2378.08] the environment right many that you know
[2376.28 - 2379.96] they're aware of these Chemtrails but
[2378.08 - 2381.76] they just ignore them too cuz they got
[2379.96 - 2384.96] to they know they have to there's no way
[2381.76 - 2387.08] of addressing it it look they're not
[2384.96 - 2389.20] aware of the complexities maybe of these
[2387.08 - 2392.28] Chemtrails at all who is nobody really
[2389.20 - 2394.00] is nobody is but nevertheless they're
[2392.28 - 2397.32] aware of something happening up there
[2394.00 - 2399.56] these Chemtrails are responsible for the
[2397.32 - 2401.12] flocks of birds that mysteriously die
[2399.56 - 2403.44] did you guys ever hear about that have
[2401.12 - 2405.72] you ever seen that where out of nowhere
[2403.44 - 2407.32] a thousand Birds die and they're all
[2405.72 - 2410.28] over the streets and all over a village
[2407.32 - 2412.92] and all over a town or they're all over
[2410.28 - 2416.36] a a a baseball diamond somewhere or they
[2412.92 - 2418.92] all over a field somewhere and someone
[2416.36 - 2422.48] you know stumbles across them all these
[2418.92 - 2426.16] flocks of birds dying everywhere around
[2422.48 - 2428.60] the planet at once the birds that swarm
[2426.16 - 2432.16] and migrate just die and they hit the
[2428.60 - 2434.36] ground and they rain it's raining birds
[2432.16 - 2436.56] why is that happening the birds are
[2434.36 - 2439.00] hitting pockets of these Chemtrails up
[2436.56 - 2442.04] in the sky cuz the Chemtrails vary from
[2439.00 - 2444.36] super super toxic sometimes deadly toxic
[2442.04 - 2446.72] sometimes partially toxic somewhat
[2444.36 - 2450.92] dangerous and because it's different
[2446.72 - 2453.12] batches of old poisonous toxins you know
[2450.92 - 2454.88] and stockpiles from any decade that
[2453.12 - 2456.60] could be loaded up into the plane and
[2454.88 - 2459.04] dropped over in the present moment right
[2456.60 - 2460.68] now that's been in storage forever so
[2459.04 - 2462.84] these birds hit these pockets of
[2460.68 - 2465.36] dangerous chemicals up in the
[2462.84 - 2468.44] sky and birds that are migrating in
[2465.36 - 2471.48] massive swarms and SW and and swarms and
[2468.44 - 2472.64] flocks occasionally they run into this
[2471.48 - 2476.16] thick
[2472.64 - 2478.68] Vaper and then dead birds rain on the
[2476.16 - 2481.72] towns and here's the sad part that's
[2478.68 - 2484.00] just when we see the birds what about in
[2481.72 - 2487.44] all the places the birds fly the
[2484.00 - 2490.60] Wilderness the forests and you don't see
[2487.44 - 2493.28] them fall and die in there you know like
[2490.60 - 2495.76] if a tree falls in the
[2493.28 - 2497.92] woods you know if you don't hear it did
[2495.76 - 2499.24] it really fall or whatever you know that
[2497.92 - 2500.56] whole saying you guys could probably you
[2499.24 - 2504.36] guys could say that better than I could
[2500.56 - 2506.52] right now I'm sure but well hey if a
[2504.36 - 2509.12] thousand birds at a clip fall into the
[2506.52 - 2512.44] forest and no one hears it no one sees
[2509.12 - 2514.88] it did it really happen yeah it did it
[2512.44 - 2517.40] did happen it
[2514.88 - 2520.00] did because birds fly in these swarms
[2517.40 - 2523.08] and flocks over vast amounts of land
[2520.00 - 2525.32] that are not populated by humans
[2523.08 - 2528.80] Chemtrails will be the end of our birds
[2525.32 - 2530.24] in the coming years way down the road
[2528.80 - 2532.64] Birds won't be
[2530.24 - 2535.28] chirping there are less Birds now than
[2532.64 - 2538.24] ever before in our history and then hey
[2535.28 - 2540.08] I got to drop this one on you right now
[2538.24 - 2542.40] just you know did you did you do you
[2540.08 - 2544.52] have your tea your herbal tea are you
[2542.40 - 2546.96] relaxing are you sitting down what about
[2544.52 - 2549.52] the bees you you guys care about the
[2546.96 - 2551.60] bees right I know I do I have a bee
[2549.52 - 2553.48] meditation in the medical medium book
[2551.60 - 2555.52] one along with other powerful
[2553.48 - 2558.84] meditations that have have helped people
[2555.52 - 2560.88] heal well you guys care about the bees
[2558.84 - 2563.48] there are theories that maybe it's the
[2560.88 - 2564.92] GMO food killing the bees oh I could see
[2563.48 - 2567.60] it now someone just got upset they're
[2564.92 - 2570.36] saying wait a minute he's Pro GMO no I'm
[2567.60 - 2572.44] not anybody who knows me knows that's
[2570.36 - 2575.20] the last thing if you read my books I'm
[2572.44 - 2576.84] not pro GMO okay and I tell you things
[2575.20 - 2579.48] about GMO people don't know about in the
[2576.84 - 2580.92] GMO industry but with the but from
[2579.48 - 2583.16] Spirit of compassion of course it's
[2580.92 - 2586.08] where I get my unique original
[2583.16 - 2588.52] information but here's the thing you
[2586.08 - 2591.28] know yeah GMO food is not helping out
[2588.52 - 2594.48] the bees it's true for for a mult
[2591.28 - 2597.28] multitude of reasons and I know that but
[2594.48 - 2600.32] there's a more predominant problem the
[2597.28 - 2601.20] Chemtrails the Chemtrails are killing
[2600.32 - 2605.40] the
[2601.20 - 2606.76] bees yes huh the Chemtrails Rain On The
[2605.40 - 2609.76] Beekeeper
[2606.76 - 2611.48] and the bees it's crazy how that works
[2609.76 - 2613.76] right isn't that bizarre you know how
[2611.48 - 2614.88] the beekeeper is smoking out the bees to
[2613.76 - 2618.08] get the
[2614.88 - 2620.56] honey a little smoke smoke
[2618.08 - 2624.32] canister well the Chemtrails are smoking
[2620.56 - 2625.40] out The Beekeeper as he's doing that and
[2624.32 - 2628.36] the
[2625.40 - 2631.36] bees what's the irony to that one it's
[2628.36 - 2633.60] so it's so crazy you know when the bees
[2631.36 - 2635.52] are docile and they're crawling around
[2633.60 - 2637.48] on the ground and they're just dying a
[2635.52 - 2638.96] slow death have you ever seen a honeybee
[2637.48 - 2640.88] just crawling around and you're like
[2638.96 - 2642.84] honeybee I want to help you I want to
[2640.88 - 2644.76] help you get to a flower I want to get
[2642.84 - 2646.28] you to a flower get a little twig get a
[2644.76 - 2648.32] leaf and get the honeybee as he's
[2646.28 - 2650.60] crawling he must just need to go back on
[2648.32 - 2653.28] his flower and get some nectar maybe
[2650.60 - 2654.52] he's unhappy what's wrong with him and
[2653.28 - 2655.88] how many times have you heard that I
[2654.52 - 2658.28] mean I've not only heard that but I've
[2655.88 - 2659.80] seen that myself I've seen it I've seen
[2658.28 - 2661.00] people talk to me about it like oh my
[2659.80 - 2664.00] God you wouldn't believe these bees are
[2661.00 - 2665.24] crawling on the ground and somebody be
[2664.00 - 2666.68] like well it's the Time of the Season
[2665.24 - 2668.32] well did the bees sting you and then the
[2666.68 - 2670.72] Stinger's gone and that's why the bees
[2668.32 - 2673.20] crawling on the ground no no that's not
[2670.72 - 2675.12] why the bee's crawling on the
[2673.20 - 2676.64] ground you know when those bees are
[2675.12 - 2678.20] docile like that and crawling on the
[2676.64 - 2681.04] ground like that they're dying a slow
[2678.20 - 2684.44] death because of chemtrails birds and
[2681.04 - 2688.52] bees are canaries in the coal mine they
[2684.44 - 2692.68] go first before us and guess what goes
[2688.52 - 2695.32] next the dragon flies they're dying
[2692.68 - 2699.28] they're the other Canary they're getting
[2695.32 - 2701.52] sicker and sicker and sicker and slower
[2699.28 - 2704.52] and slower than ever and we need those
[2701.52 - 2706.48] dragon flies we need those
[2704.52 - 2709.80] desperately
[2706.48 - 2711.96] butterflies bye-bye butterflies for the
[2709.80 - 2713.80] future because butterflies are going to
[2711.96 - 2717.24] take a big hit big hit from the
[2713.80 - 2719.92] Chemtrails and they already are and then
[2717.24 - 2722.00] we have the schools of fish wait a
[2719.92 - 2723.92] minute you know the schools of fish that
[2722.00 - 2726.16] die by the hundreds of thousands in our
[2723.92 - 2727.88] oceans they wash up on the shore and
[2726.16 - 2729.72] everybody's smelling dead fish and
[2727.88 - 2731.80] freaking out environmentalists are
[2729.72 - 2733.96] testing the water and freaking out and
[2731.80 - 2735.52] nobody knows what happened at all it's
[2733.96 - 2738.96] just nobody knows what happened and all
[2735.52 - 2741.44] these fish are just sharks too sharks
[2738.96 - 2743.20] everything is just coming up swordfish
[2741.44 - 2745.52] everything any kind of fish is just you
[2743.20 - 2748.72] know seab bass everything's just washing
[2745.52 - 2750.56] up dead it it's unbelievable it's
[2748.72 - 2752.84] unbelievable as it's sitting on the
[2750.56 - 2754.40] beach rotting and then you hear well
[2752.84 - 2756.88] wait a minute wait a minute maybe it was
[2754.40 - 2760.20] the algae bloom and algae Bloom okay
[2756.88 - 2762.44] yeah okay yeah sure of course where'
[2760.20 - 2764.68] that algae bloom come from how does that
[2762.44 - 2766.08] work that's why you see from time to
[2764.68 - 2768.20] time the stories out there are
[2766.08 - 2770.36] devastating about you know the amount of
[2768.20 - 2773.72] dead fish and other sea life what about
[2770.36 - 2777.20] other sea life not even fish just on the
[2773.72 - 2779.28] shore rotting and what about all the
[2777.20 - 2781.80] kill offs that aren't being talked about
[2779.28 - 2785.08] or seen that's just the ones that are
[2781.80 - 2787.12] seen you know Spirit of compassion you
[2785.08 - 2789.08] know tells me about these chemical soups
[2787.12 - 2790.80] that drop out of the PLS and what they
[2789.08 - 2794.52] do they
[2790.80 - 2797.68] pull you know they pull in areas of the
[2794.52 - 2800.96] ocean that are more stagnant because of
[2797.68 - 2804.56] different currents so the chemical soups
[2800.96 - 2807.88] that have this mutated toxic algae
[2804.56 - 2809.68] that's 50 60 years old sometimes that
[2807.88 - 2811.36] just came out of an old tank and was
[2809.68 - 2815.16] just recently stuck into a plane and
[2811.36 - 2817.84] then dumped on us that algae okay that
[2815.16 - 2819.76] dangerous toxic stuff it ends up
[2817.84 - 2822.48] proliferating and thriving in more
[2819.76 - 2824.40] stagnant areas naturally stagnant
[2822.48 - 2827.24] because of just the current of you know
[2824.40 - 2829.88] edies and oceans and and and movement
[2827.24 - 2831.60] and all that and then fish swimming
[2829.88 - 2833.28] along they're trying to get food whoa
[2831.60 - 2834.84] schools of fish are like Whoa We got
[2833.28 - 2836.40] some good stuff to eat we're going we're
[2834.84 - 2837.72] going and they hit these poles of
[2836.40 - 2839.96] chemicals and toxic mutated
[2837.72 - 2842.00] microorganisms and algaes and they die
[2839.96 - 2845.00] fast just like birds
[2842.00 - 2848.52] instantly they just die and it's
[2845.00 - 2851.96] immediately f for the fish and the birds
[2848.52 - 2854.68] welcome to the Chemtrails welcome to the
[2851.96 - 2857.76] Chemtrails in 20 years from now the
[2854.68 - 2863.20] plane fleets will be increased greatly
[2857.76 - 2866.12] the goal is the to have a vast Fleet the
[2863.20 - 2868.36] chemtrail planes already take up a large
[2866.12 - 2871.60] percentage of the sky as far as with the
[2868.36 - 2874.72] flight patterns and everything and you
[2871.60 - 2877.28] know what's crazy is the flight Towers
[2874.72 - 2879.20] they just have to ignore it I mean
[2877.28 - 2880.80] forget the radar well what are all these
[2879.20 - 2882.72] planes oh they're not passenger planes
[2880.80 - 2885.60] and what are they everybody has to
[2882.72 - 2887.92] ignore it that's that is really
[2885.60 - 2889.60] interesting right I know everybody's
[2887.92 - 2891.72] worried about 5G right now and I'm going
[2889.60 - 2893.76] to talk about 5G eventually and go into
[2891.72 - 2895.68] that and if it affects her health or if
[2893.76 - 2898.12] not or however I'm going to go into that
[2895.68 - 2900.20] whole thing we're going to cover it and
[2898.12 - 2902.16] we're going to get there don't worry and
[2900.20 - 2904.44] spirit and compassion will have powerful
[2902.16 - 2906.44] information nobody knows about it
[2904.44 - 2909.56] meanwhile no one's worried about the
[2906.44 - 2912.04] chemtrail game and yeah it's a game it's
[2909.56 - 2913.64] a sick game I call it a game because
[2912.04 - 2917.52] Spirit of compassion tells me it's
[2913.64 - 2920.84] become one it has you know Spirit of
[2917.52 - 2923.44] compassion tells me that the industry
[2920.84 - 2925.80] the chemical Industries worldwide they
[2923.44 - 2928.00] want us focused on other targets you
[2925.80 - 2929.88] know they want us focused on 5G they
[2928.00 - 2931.80] want us focused on anything else that's
[2929.88 - 2934.40] bad they just don't want it focused on
[2931.80 - 2937.00] those Chemtrails that's bad I call it a
[2934.40 - 2939.12] game like I said cuz it's become one and
[2937.00 - 2941.56] look they want us focused on this they
[2939.12 - 2943.44] want us focused on plastic bags which is
[2941.56 - 2945.80] it's good focus it is they want us to
[2943.44 - 2948.52] focus on cups and straws and toilet
[2945.80 - 2949.80] paper rolls you know like empty toilet
[2948.52 - 2953.48] paper
[2949.80 - 2955.40] rolls cans and bottles uh they want us
[2953.48 - 2957.40] focus on creating less trash I think
[2955.40 - 2960.64] it's all important I stand behind all of
[2957.40 - 2963.04] that that that is important it CU it is
[2960.64 - 2965.20] right but you know yeah it's like when
[2963.04 - 2967.88] I'm taking the bottles you know and I'm
[2965.20 - 2969.76] taking whatever like the recyclables to
[2967.88 - 2972.92] the garbage and I look up and I see the
[2969.76 - 2974.52] Chemtrails up there uh I I mean yeah I'm
[2972.92 - 2976.56] looking at all the Chemtrails in the sky
[2974.52 - 2979.40] while I'm trying to recycle stuff it's
[2976.56 - 2981.96] it's it's a tough one to swallow right I
[2979.40 - 2984.20] don't know it's it's hard for me because
[2981.96 - 2985.80] I'm like maybe what cuz I know so much
[2984.20 - 2987.16] about this stuff and you're just like
[2985.80 - 2988.96] you're looking up at the sky and you see
[2987.16 - 2991.16] 10 Chemtrails and you're like what Brew
[2988.96 - 2993.28] is that is that from 20 years ago is
[2991.16 - 2995.52] that from 60 years ago what kind of
[2993.28 - 2997.44] toxic crap is that coming down is it
[2995.52 - 2999.52] pesticide you know byproduct is it an
[2997.44 - 3001.88] herbicide byproduct what could what
[2999.52 - 3003.96] could it be and you know you sit there
[3001.88 - 3008.48] and then you put your recyclables in the
[3003.96 - 3010.72] bin and look I mean you can look in this
[3008.48 - 3012.44] guy many times and you'll see 30 40
[3010.72 - 3013.84] Chemtrails just drifting along they
[3012.44 - 3016.40] drift along
[3013.84 - 3018.56] forever but I get it we have to do our
[3016.40 - 3021.52] part and we have to be mindful about the
[3018.56 - 3023.36] environment which I stand behind 100%
[3021.52 - 3027.12] we're being Mindful and they're playing
[3023.36 - 3029.72] a sick joke on us and look maybe you
[3027.12 - 3032.36] don't see it that way I kind of do a
[3029.72 - 3034.60] little bit the Chemtrails they settle in
[3032.36 - 3036.00] the early morning de so check this out
[3034.60 - 3038.32] this is an important piece of
[3036.00 - 3040.24] information the Chemtrails they're
[3038.32 - 3041.56] falling all night long and they fall
[3040.24 - 3043.40] during the day too but there's a
[3041.56 - 3047.36] difference in the morning right around
[3043.40 - 3048.92] Dawn there's this moisture that occurs
[3047.36 - 3050.88] and that moisture ends up on your car
[3048.92 - 3052.60] windshield that moisture ends up on the
[3050.88 - 3054.56] grass in the summertime where it's wet
[3052.60 - 3056.48] in the morning and you'll find that
[3054.56 - 3058.16] happening a lot and when you're walking
[3056.48 - 3060.36] along you can even get soak and wet in
[3058.16 - 3061.60] the grass if you're walking on a lawn
[3060.36 - 3064.88] you know first thing in the morning
[3061.60 - 3067.40] early that moisture holds in the air in
[3064.88 - 3069.92] the morning and it holds on and suspends
[3067.40 - 3072.68] all that chemtrail that's been dropped
[3069.92 - 3075.40] down and it tends to Harbor underneath
[3072.68 - 3076.68] the tree line so when people are jogging
[3075.40 - 3078.24] and they're jogging they're running in
[3076.68 - 3080.20] the morning out they're out in the
[3078.24 - 3082.00] streets jogging running wherever they
[3080.20 - 3084.48] are or they're walking on Trails or
[3082.00 - 3086.60] whatever it is they're inhaling more
[3084.48 - 3088.40] they're inhaling more the Chemtrails at
[3086.60 - 3091.40] that time in the morning it hasn't kind
[3088.40 - 3094.64] of lifted and blown away yet it hasn't
[3091.40 - 3096.84] kind of moved and shaken out of it so
[3094.64 - 3098.16] when we're doing our workouts and we're
[3096.84 - 3100.56] doing that we're breathing in and
[3098.16 - 3102.52] inhaling more chemtrail and we're
[3100.56 - 3106.08] sweating and we're absorbing it into our
[3102.52 - 3107.68] pores that's what happens and you know
[3106.08 - 3109.88] that's why look we'll talk about some
[3107.68 - 3111.36] tips and some things to just think about
[3109.88 - 3113.84] protect ourselves and everything and all
[3111.36 - 3116.92] that coming up but check this out our
[3113.84 - 3119.32] skies are supposed to be sacred right I
[3116.92 - 3120.92] mean do you think our skies are sacred
[3119.32 - 3124.12] do they mean something to you when you
[3120.92 - 3125.76] look up into the sky I mean you look up
[3124.12 - 3127.28] there do you ever lay on your back on
[3125.76 - 3129.44] the ground and you're looking at the
[3127.28 - 3131.88] clouds as they're changing shape and you
[3129.44 - 3134.24] see different shapes in the clouds and
[3131.88 - 3135.56] we look up look at them in awe and we
[3134.24 - 3137.60] think about the things hey there's a
[3135.56 - 3139.80] horse up there look that cloud looks
[3137.60 - 3141.16] like a horse hey that cloud looks like
[3139.80 - 3143.64] something else and what about the fact
[3141.16 - 3145.88] that we pray too so many people pray and
[3143.64 - 3148.52] the sky means everything what about
[3145.88 - 3151.08] meditation we meditate with a sensation
[3148.52 - 3153.72] of something above us don't we like when
[3151.08 - 3154.92] you meditate are you thinking or feeling
[3153.72 - 3157.56] something above you when you're
[3154.92 - 3161.48] meditating like the sky or the universe
[3157.56 - 3164.76] that feeling above us and you know
[3161.48 - 3166.80] children fly kites right in the sky you
[3164.76 - 3170.28] look at the sky and you're flying a kite
[3166.80 - 3172.52] on a windy day we feel the Sunshine on
[3170.28 - 3174.48] our faces and we look at the falling
[3172.52 - 3177.64] stars at night have you ever looked for
[3174.48 - 3179.36] falling stars and you dream and we look
[3177.64 - 3181.60] at the
[3179.36 - 3184.32] constellations meanwhile what's going on
[3181.60 - 3187.36] here on our planet yeah is sad and
[3184.32 - 3189.60] corrupt this is one of the many reasons
[3187.36 - 3192.44] why I get disappointed when people in
[3189.60 - 3194.12] the health movement don't think we need
[3192.44 - 3195.24] to cleanse and I'm going to repeat that
[3194.12 - 3197.52] for a second people in the health
[3195.24 - 3199.72] movement yeah there's many of them that
[3197.52 - 3201.84] don't think we need to cleanse and if
[3199.72 - 3203.80] they do think we need a cleanse it's a
[3201.84 - 3205.80] cleanse that doesn't get any cleansing
[3203.80 - 3207.32] done but
[3205.80 - 3208.64] and if you're new to Medical medium
[3207.32 - 3210.64] information you can learn about
[3208.64 - 3211.92] cleansing everything sure and all that
[3210.64 - 3215.56] and making sure you're doing it in a
[3211.92 - 3218.52] really good way healthy way and you know
[3215.56 - 3221.04] health professionals and hobbyists hacks
[3218.52 - 3224.08] and health influencers and influencers
[3221.04 - 3225.52] don't know what's causing our illness um
[3224.08 - 3227.68] they don't know why everybody has
[3225.52 - 3230.28] chronic fatigue syndrome and all the
[3227.68 - 3232.08] different autoimmune varieties and and
[3230.28 - 3235.16] rheumatoid arthritis and Hashim modus
[3232.08 - 3236.72] thyroiditis and fatigue anxiety and and
[3235.16 - 3238.52] you know everything else all the tingles
[3236.72 - 3241.32] and numbness and aches and pains and
[3238.52 - 3243.92] depression people don't know why chronic
[3241.32 - 3245.52] illness is still just completely not
[3243.92 - 3247.44] understood and
[3245.52 - 3249.60] misunderstood unless they've gotten
[3247.44 - 3251.84] tidbits from medical medium information
[3249.60 - 3255.12] throughout the years you know like
[3251.84 - 3258.48] celery juice therapeutically 16 o or 32
[3255.12 - 3260.44] o or 64 ounces on an empty stomach and
[3258.48 - 3261.84] how to use it making sure you don't mix
[3260.44 - 3263.56] anything with it the world wasn't
[3261.84 - 3266.44] drinking celery juice before Spirit of
[3263.56 - 3270.04] compassion put it out there and in the
[3266.44 - 3271.92] way therapeutically like you know he has
[3270.04 - 3273.44] but everybody's a health expert these
[3271.92 - 3274.84] days but what's interesting about
[3273.44 - 3276.52] everybody being a health expert these
[3274.84 - 3278.96] days they don't have a clue about why
[3276.52 - 3282.20] we're even sick or what we're even up
[3278.96 - 3285.48] against and this is just one reason why
[3282.20 - 3287.76] we have to take care of ourselves is
[3285.48 - 3290.64] because of this very reason here the
[3287.76 - 3292.04] same reason why nobody knew what was
[3290.64 - 3294.16] happening with these Chemtrails people
[3292.04 - 3295.84] who believe Chemtrails exist don't know
[3294.16 - 3298.12] how it works and everything else and I'm
[3295.84 - 3302.04] giving you the I'm giving you the
[3298.12 - 3303.72] information right now but hey that's
[3302.04 - 3306.88] what I mean there's even more things
[3303.72 - 3308.68] than that there's so much more and look
[3306.88 - 3310.44] what's in the medical medium books about
[3308.68 - 3312.44] why we're sick there's a reason why we
[3310.44 - 3315.20] have to take care of ourselves we need
[3312.44 - 3317.04] extra help but we need the right tools
[3315.20 - 3320.12] your body needs to be
[3317.04 - 3322.92] validated it needs to know you
[3320.12 - 3325.52] understand its fight like you understand
[3322.92 - 3328.72] what it's up against your body needs to
[3325.52 - 3331.04] not only have like the right tools that
[3328.72 - 3333.44] you possess to offer your body but it
[3331.04 - 3335.84] needs to know you're in the game that
[3333.44 - 3337.04] you're in it with it and that's the
[3335.84 - 3338.76] whole thing because our bodies are on
[3337.04 - 3341.20] their own and then we're all playing
[3338.76 - 3343.48] guessing games that's how it works out
[3341.20 - 3345.84] there you know it's like people they'd
[3343.48 - 3347.28] rather just think that maybe you know
[3345.84 - 3349.56] their health problem is a little bit
[3347.28 - 3351.00] their gut their microbiomes off or
[3349.56 - 3352.28] something their gut floor is off and
[3351.00 - 3353.76] that's why everything like it's all in
[3352.28 - 3357.04] their gut and that's why they're sick
[3353.76 - 3358.64] and that's why they have eczema or acne
[3357.04 - 3361.16] or any kind of other condition or
[3358.64 - 3363.48] fatigue maybe they think it's genetics
[3361.16 - 3365.24] too or it's hormones or they need to be
[3363.48 - 3367.12] rewired and it's all in their head like
[3365.24 - 3369.68] their train of thought isn't good and
[3367.12 - 3372.32] it's time to rewire their mind or get
[3369.68 - 3374.04] their meditations right and you know and
[3372.32 - 3375.60] maybe it's okay if it's autoimmune and
[3374.04 - 3377.92] your body's attacking itself kind of
[3375.60 - 3380.12] thought but people they just don't
[3377.92 - 3381.84] really give their bodies the
[3380.12 - 3384.04] understanding their body needs and
[3381.84 - 3385.88] that's a problem out there and I know a
[3384.04 - 3387.72] lot of people they believe they're
[3385.88 - 3390.56] Health experts or they want to become
[3387.72 - 3393.76] Health experts and they don't know what
[3390.56 - 3396.68] we're really up against or what causes
[3393.76 - 3398.72] Hashimoto thyroiditis or what causes
[3396.68 - 3401.68] rheumatoid arthritis or what causes
[3398.72 - 3404.00] chronic fatigue or eczema and psoriasis
[3401.68 - 3406.20] and anxiety and tingles and numbness and
[3404.00 - 3409.24] AES and pains and vertigo and if you
[3406.20 - 3411.56] don't know what causes all that and then
[3409.24 - 3415.08] you don't know what contributes to all
[3411.56 - 3418.84] of that and your body's like hey help me
[3415.08 - 3420.88] um no it's it's not leaky gut nope um
[3418.84 - 3423.48] it's no apple cider vinegar isn't the
[3420.88 - 3427.44] answer it never got anybody with lupus
[3423.48 - 3428.64] healed um uh Apple CER vinegar never uh
[3427.44 - 3430.68] got somebody better with multiple
[3428.64 - 3433.44] sclerosis uh please uh I need the
[3430.68 - 3436.32] answers here I need help I need you to
[3433.44 - 3438.64] believe in me and know what's wrong
[3436.32 - 3440.24] there's toxic heavy metals and there's
[3438.64 - 3442.88] Chemtrails falling out of the sky and
[3440.24 - 3445.76] there's pathogens and bacteria viruses
[3442.88 - 3447.64] and there's the Epstein bar and all in
[3445.76 - 3449.48] petrochemicals in our system and
[3447.64 - 3451.00] everything else and I need you to work
[3449.48 - 3453.68] with me here and that's what our bodies
[3451.00 - 3456.88] are like wanting but we get thrown off
[3453.68 - 3458.40] track and and it happens every day I see
[3456.88 - 3461.68] it out there people are worried about
[3458.40 - 3462.64] collagen and you know I get it but
[3461.68 - 3464.24] they're doing that while they're
[3462.64 - 3467.04] guzzling down coffee and burning out
[3464.24 - 3469.76] their adrenals I think look the bottom
[3467.04 - 3472.08] line is it's about like are you going to
[3469.76 - 3474.48] work with your body because it's not
[3472.08 - 3476.16] hopeless it's not and I still got to I
[3474.48 - 3477.80] got a cover more on chem trols I'm still
[3476.16 - 3479.24] heading in there we got more information
[3477.80 - 3484.36] about chem trols that I have to talk
[3479.24 - 3487.24] about but it's not hopeless when you
[3484.36 - 3490.24] work with your body and you look out for
[3487.24 - 3492.52] it and you understand it and it
[3490.24 - 3494.64] understands you and we just we work
[3492.52 - 3497.16] together as the Chemtrails fall out of
[3494.64 - 3499.92] the sky they have to land somewhere and
[3497.16 - 3503.00] you might be somebody that's like hey I
[3499.92 - 3505.56] eat really good food I eat grass-fed
[3503.00 - 3506.76] beef but the chem Trails they got to
[3505.56 - 3509.68] land on the
[3506.76 - 3511.72] fields and the rain washes them into the
[3509.68 - 3513.32] Earth too and if you maybe you're maybe
[3511.72 - 3515.64] you don't eat animal products maybe
[3513.32 - 3517.68] you're vegan maybe you're plant-based
[3515.64 - 3523.04] and all the Chemtrails just on all our
[3517.68 - 3525.52] vegetables it's on everything we eat and
[3523.04 - 3527.52] the soil gets disrupted because it gets
[3525.52 - 3528.88] depleted of zinc nobody knows about this
[3527.52 - 3531.92] information I've talked about that
[3528.88 - 3533.60] Metals fall from the sky that's the
[3531.92 - 3535.84] Chemtrails I've been talking about all
[3533.60 - 3538.04] these years you guys Metals fall from
[3535.84 - 3539.56] the skies they soak into the store they
[3538.04 - 3543.28] soak into the
[3539.56 - 3545.36] soil and they destroy microorganisms the
[3543.28 - 3547.36] soil born microorganisms in the soil
[3545.36 - 3551.24] they kill the soil and they deplete it
[3547.36 - 3553.56] of zinc and our soil becomes immune
[3551.24 - 3556.20] deficient that's what happens from
[3553.56 - 3557.92] Chemtrails now look we still need to eat
[3556.20 - 3559.68] our Foods we still need to eat you know
[3557.92 - 3561.04] our organic foods we can't get organic
[3559.68 - 3564.08] we get you know conventional but the
[3561.04 - 3565.32] point is is that we need to take care of
[3564.08 - 3567.04] our body
[3565.32 - 3569.00] while we're eating and living here we
[3567.04 - 3570.80] have to adapt and then if you're doing
[3569.00 - 3572.96] the animal proteins well I do I do
[3570.80 - 3574.72] grass-fed beef somebody might say I got
[3572.96 - 3577.48] it down I'll do a little grass fed beef
[3574.72 - 3580.00] I do Freer range chicken or whatever and
[3577.48 - 3582.52] animals or I do lamb or something
[3580.00 - 3585.04] animals graze any kind of animals that
[3582.52 - 3587.48] graze and they're eating grass or
[3585.04 - 3589.84] they're eating meal of some kind that
[3587.48 - 3592.00] was raised either way with chems falling
[3589.84 - 3594.44] on it it was grown with chems falling on
[3592.00 - 3596.84] it either way animals that graze in the
[3594.44 - 3598.72] ground grass that grass is loaded with
[3596.84 - 3602.12] Chemtrails and it builds up in
[3598.72 - 3604.48] concentrations inside the animals so
[3602.12 - 3605.92] that grassfed beef or grass-fed butter
[3604.48 - 3608.32] will still have concentrations of
[3605.92 - 3610.16] chemical soup that won't even be tested
[3608.32 - 3612.72] because they don't they're not testing
[3610.16 - 3615.64] for that they're not finding what's in
[3612.72 - 3618.92] Chemtrails in our food that builds up in
[3615.64 - 3619.96] our bodies when you eat it they're not
[3618.92 - 3623.00] looking cuz they don't even know what to
[3619.96 - 3625.08] look for guess what because 90% of the
[3623.00 - 3628.16] chemicals falling out of the sky
[3625.08 - 3631.28] from these Chemtrails are
[3628.16 - 3633.92] unidentified they're privatized
[3631.28 - 3637.24] chemicals they're secret soups and
[3633.92 - 3639.32] recipes made by the chemical industry
[3637.24 - 3641.12] that don't even they have their own that
[3639.32 - 3643.12] don't even have patents never mind the
[3641.12 - 3646.28] ones that are patented they're still
[3643.12 - 3647.72] their own recipe no one knows what's in
[3646.28 - 3649.72] most of the stuff especially their
[3647.72 - 3651.80] mistakes and their test ones they're
[3649.72 - 3653.80] test runs nobody knows what's in this
[3651.80 - 3655.88] stuff so it's not even anybody's even
[3653.80 - 3658.60] testing this stuff stuff in our food
[3655.88 - 3660.68] that's how sad it is and if you don't
[3658.60 - 3663.52] know how to assist your body in getting
[3660.68 - 3665.36] this stuff out of you well it leads to
[3663.52 - 3666.32] problems down the road and you might be
[3665.36 - 3668.88] somebody that's like I don't want to
[3666.32 - 3670.48] know about it I don't want to know I got
[3668.88 - 3672.00] a friend that's like that just doesn't
[3670.48 - 3674.28] want to know doesn't want to know what's
[3672.00 - 3676.60] being dropped on them rather just you
[3674.28 - 3679.40] know I want a glass of wine and just
[3676.60 - 3681.92] leave me alone and I kind of want to do
[3679.40 - 3684.88] my thing sure okay fine fine when you're
[3681.92 - 3687.44] sick down the road whatever and but the
[3684.88 - 3689.36] thing is that zinc deficiencies we all
[3687.44 - 3691.68] have you know that's because the soil is
[3689.36 - 3695.52] getting depleted by Chemtrails is being
[3691.68 - 3697.24] a big part of it and when we have no
[3695.52 - 3699.64] zinc in us or very little zinc in us
[3697.24 - 3702.36] it's why we get sick from
[3699.64 - 3704.24] viruses any kind of virus virus that's
[3702.36 - 3706.04] going around whatever any kind of virus
[3704.24 - 3708.56] the Epstein bars that people are passing
[3706.04 - 3711.48] around the shingles viruses the hhv 6es
[3708.56 - 3713.84] the hhv 7s the simplex 1 and Simplex 2
[3711.48 - 3715.56] just because you had a cold sore years
[3713.84 - 3717.64] ago doesn't mean that simplex virus
[3715.56 - 3719.40] isn't living inside of our livers and
[3717.64 - 3721.44] our bodies and wreaking havoc and giving
[3719.40 - 3723.20] us other symptoms see nobody knows all
[3721.44 - 3726.92] this information they just don't
[3723.20 - 3729.32] understand that but you know in order to
[3726.92 - 3730.60] adapt in order to take care of ourselves
[3729.32 - 3734.40] we have to
[3730.60 - 3736.24] adapt and that's a big part of it and
[3734.40 - 3737.76] you know what's funny all the
[3736.24 - 3740.28] information Spirit of compassion gives
[3737.76 - 3742.60] me in the volumes I put out there and
[3740.28 - 3745.48] the frontier head of Frontier
[3742.60 - 3746.80] groundbreaking information in
[3745.48 - 3749.12] alternative medicine conventional
[3746.80 - 3751.80] medicine that that I've put out over the
[3749.12 - 3754.32] years and with all of that you'll hear
[3751.80 - 3755.96] out there lymphatic system Anthony
[3754.32 - 3757.52] doesn't know about the lymphatic system
[3755.96 - 3760.44] he doesn't know he doesn't know anything
[3757.52 - 3764.92] about the lymphatic system it's
[3760.44 - 3766.48] like are you kidding me my god do you
[3764.92 - 3770.48] know anything about the
[3766.48 - 3771.92] Chemtrails you know never mind that and
[3770.48 - 3773.52] it's interesting you'll hear from people
[3771.92 - 3775.04] like he doesn't know about the lymphatic
[3773.52 - 3777.72] system you'll hear that from people that
[3775.04 - 3779.40] don't know why anyone's sick they don't
[3777.72 - 3781.16] know why people have viruses or what
[3779.40 - 3782.84] kind of viruses or why people are sick
[3781.16 - 3785.00] with anything or where toxic heavy
[3782.84 - 3787.20] metals sit in the liver in the brain or
[3785.00 - 3790.20] any of that stuff and if they did get a
[3787.20 - 3792.32] tidbit of that somewhere so 35 years of
[3790.20 - 3793.56] work of putting it out there Spirit of
[3792.32 - 3796.20] compassion's work all these years you
[3793.56 - 3798.64] know the health movement it was a small
[3796.20 - 3801.12] small world it still is now but it was a
[3798.64 - 3803.68] small world back 35 years ago really
[3801.12 - 3805.16] really small and so that information I
[3803.68 - 3807.40] just put it out there and put it out
[3805.16 - 3808.92] there and put it out there you know but
[3807.40 - 3811.00] what's interesting about the lymphatic
[3808.92 - 3812.44] system is people be like hey doesn't
[3811.00 - 3813.72] know about the lymphatic system you
[3812.44 - 3816.28] kidding I've written about it in the
[3813.72 - 3818.08] books but that's coming from people who
[3816.28 - 3821.40] don't even know why anybody's sick like
[3818.08 - 3824.32] I said before and really you got to go
[3821.40 - 3825.60] deeper past the lymphatic system that's
[3824.32 - 3828.08] where you have to go you have to go
[3825.60 - 3830.68] where real problems are inside the body
[3828.08 - 3832.68] like bigger problems much bigger
[3830.68 - 3834.28] problems like deep in the liver because
[3832.68 - 3835.84] that's what I've been talking about all
[3834.28 - 3839.08] all these years and all these years
[3835.84 - 3842.24] lymphatic system cleanses out its Poison
[3839.08 - 3844.04] by default on its own it's doing that as
[3842.24 - 3846.44] you live and breathe and and live your
[3844.04 - 3848.36] life but if your liver's clogged up and
[3846.44 - 3850.72] stagnant and sluggish and you got
[3848.36 - 3853.36] low-grade viruses nobody wants to know
[3850.72 - 3855.56] about because the lymphatic system isn't
[3853.36 - 3857.44] why you have Lupus your lymphatic like
[3855.56 - 3859.24] the lymphatic system isn't causing that
[3857.44 - 3861.80] your lymphatic system is not causing
[3859.24 - 3863.48] neurological symptoms it's not causing
[3861.80 - 3866.08] tingles and numbness and aches and pains
[3863.48 - 3868.72] and ticks and spasms and burning skin
[3866.08 - 3870.96] and floaters in the eyes and severe
[3868.72 - 3873.72] fatigue your lymphatic system doesn't do
[3870.96 - 3876.56] that it doesn't create it's not causing
[3873.72 - 3880.08] your edema it's coming from a deeper
[3876.56 - 3882.96] Source it's coming from pathogens your
[3880.08 - 3885.32] lymphatic system doesn't cause lupus it
[3882.96 - 3887.84] doesn't cause Hashimoto it doesn't cause
[3885.32 - 3889.68] lime it doesn't c yeah that's what's so
[3887.84 - 3892.32] funny it's like oh it's the lymphatic
[3889.68 - 3894.84] system that's really interesting but you
[3892.32 - 3897.44] know your lymphatic system's health
[3894.84 - 3901.00] happens to be a direct result of your
[3897.44 - 3903.68] liver's Health it's a direct result of
[3901.00 - 3905.96] if you have pathogens and that's what
[3903.68 - 3908.56] people all have and they're all passing
[3905.96 - 3911.16] around and if you're just focused on the
[3908.56 - 3914.36] lymphatic system but not the real
[3911.16 - 3915.60] problem it's like cleaning your house
[3914.36 - 3916.80] you know you're cleaning your house
[3915.60 - 3918.92] you're cleaning your bedroom you're
[3916.80 - 3920.52] cleaning your rooms you're cleaning your
[3918.92 - 3922.36] bathroom you're cleaning your kitchen
[3920.52 - 3924.28] spotless you're scrubbing your kitchen
[3922.36 - 3926.08] sink you know you're trying you're
[3924.28 - 3927.32] cleaning it all that's your lymphatic
[3926.08 - 3930.40] system you know you're cleaning
[3927.32 - 3933.68] everything Meanwhile your basement has
[3930.40 - 3936.04] rats fering in it mice festering and it
[3933.68 - 3937.60] roaches ants and termites and they live
[3936.04 - 3939.52] in your basement and they're breeding
[3937.60 - 3941.20] and nesting and devouring the very
[3939.52 - 3943.08] Foundation of your house but you're
[3941.20 - 3945.44] worried about your lymphatic system and
[3943.08 - 3947.00] you're cleaning the up upstairs there
[3945.44 - 3948.52] and you're cleaning the upstairs and
[3947.00 - 3949.92] you're not even you're you know that's
[3948.52 - 3951.76] the thing so people pretending the
[3949.92 - 3954.16] lymphatic system is why we're sick is
[3951.76 - 3955.72] really a joke I mean that's a joke I
[3954.16 - 3959.88] mean that's
[3955.72 - 3962.96] 101 um let's see beginners back I don't
[3959.88 - 3964.72] know uh years ago when nobody knew what
[3962.96 - 3968.20] why anybody's sick and once again well
[3964.72 - 3971.52] is it candida uh is it lymphatic system
[3968.20 - 3974.00] is it gut is it what is it it's back to
[3971.52 - 3975.80] that game so it's kind of sad and when I
[3974.00 - 3978.24] see that out there it's kind of sad
[3975.80 - 3979.76] meanwhile yeah you drink your celery
[3978.24 - 3982.08] juice and you're going to go for the
[3979.76 - 3984.40] deeper problems therapeutically you do
[3982.08 - 3986.32] your heavy metal detox smoothie you go
[3984.40 - 3989.88] for the deeper problems therapeutically
[3986.32 - 3992.68] go with 32 o of lemon water you go to
[3989.88 - 3994.20] the deeper root like deeper and then
[3992.68 - 3995.84] that's just the start of some of the
[3994.20 - 3999.96] medical medium tools that got around
[3995.84 - 4001.76] over the last 35 plus years and so when
[3999.96 - 4004.04] you talk about the lymphatic system you
[4001.76 - 4005.84] missed the point of allog together about
[4004.04 - 4008.04] everything else the
[4005.84 - 4010.00] pathogens everything we're dealing with
[4008.04 - 4012.72] all the toxins like from the Chemtrails
[4010.00 - 4014.56] we inhale daily that have to go into the
[4012.72 - 4016.72] liver cuz that's where they go they go
[4014.56 - 4018.72] into the liver and all these other
[4016.72 - 4021.32] toxins they just go and they they make
[4018.72 - 4023.64] our liver sick and stagnant and that has
[4021.32 - 4027.44] to get sick and stagnant first for your
[4023.64 - 4030.08] lymphatic system to even have any issues
[4027.44 - 4032.00] you have there has to be a sicker deeper
[4030.08 - 4033.20] problem you I'll be talking about the
[4032.00 - 4035.28] lymphatic system in the future we're
[4033.20 - 4038.64] going to do a whole podcast inside and
[4035.28 - 4040.60] out about the lymphatic system but why
[4038.64 - 4044.60] do I want you to do lemon water in the
[4040.60 - 4046.96] morning more than 8 O much more than 8 O
[4044.60 - 4050.56] why do I want you to do lemon water 16
[4046.96 - 4052.68] to 32 o because it's purifying more than
[4050.56 - 4055.92] just your lymphatic system I'm trying to
[4052.68 - 4058.16] go for the deeper stuff I'm trying to go
[4055.92 - 4060.12] for the deeper stuff not the surface
[4058.16 - 4061.96] stuff I'm not trying to go for the
[4060.12 - 4064.56] surface stuff the lymphatic system isn't
[4061.96 - 4067.08] why somebody's bedridden and they got
[4064.56 - 4070.20] like the worst hives and lupus and
[4067.08 - 4072.16] migraines and trigeminal neuralgia and
[4070.20 - 4075.28] their back is killing them and they
[4072.16 - 4077.08] could barely walk and they're feet hurt
[4075.28 - 4079.20] that's not the lymphatic system I mean
[4077.08 - 4081.52] it's so embarrassing when I think about
[4079.20 - 4086.92] it it's so beginner stupid I mean I'm
[4081.52 - 4089.36] sorry I'm sorry it's just look
[4086.92 - 4091.72] anyway the lemon water is critical for
[4089.36 - 4093.96] flushing to get to the Deep rooted
[4091.72 - 4095.96] things the cell juice is critical for
[4093.96 - 4098.28] using it therapeutically to destroy
[4095.96 - 4100.28] pathogens that are deep inside the liver
[4098.28 - 4102.96] deep ins seter organs that are in their
[4100.28 - 4105.04] bloodstream and so forth you know and
[4102.96 - 4107.64] the celer juice is disarming these
[4105.04 - 4110.32] toxins that fall from the sky and all
[4107.64 - 4112.96] that stuff see the tools are all here
[4110.32 - 4115.64] I've always had you in mind for what we
[4112.96 - 4117.56] face and what you don't know you face
[4115.64 - 4120.76] out
[4117.56 - 4123.56] there Chemtrails are part of the
[4120.76 - 4127.24] spiritual war that's going on around us
[4123.56 - 4130.36] and above us Mercury is part of that
[4127.24 - 4132.88] spiritual war that's going around us the
[4130.36 - 4136.44] caffeine industry is part of that
[4132.88 - 4139.28] spiritual war that's going on around us
[4136.44 - 4142.76] so many pieces of the puzzle that show
[4139.28 - 4145.72] us there's good versus evil and how evil
[4142.76 - 4148.44] looks for ways to control people and
[4145.72 - 4151.52] then keeps them controlled and then gets
[4148.44 - 4154.20] them sick and has The Thirst to keep
[4151.52 - 4156.92] them sick forever if possible and then
[4154.20 - 4161.60] wants them relying on everything they
[4156.92 - 4164.16] just don't really need Darkness never
[4161.60 - 4167.08] wants her eyes open and see what's in
[4164.16 - 4170.00] the sky and above the trees it would
[4167.08 - 4173.56] rather have us unknowing its time and
[4170.00 - 4177.04] then bring us to our knees they keep us
[4173.56 - 4179.76] busy down here distracted some are bored
[4177.04 - 4182.40] they want us to lose ourselves in our
[4179.76 - 4185.40] minds while all the bad around us keeps
[4182.40 - 4187.48] getting ignored there is hope when
[4185.40 - 4190.72] you're empowered though you have the
[4187.48 - 4193.72] truth on your side and the knowledge and
[4190.72 - 4196.52] you support your body with what it needs
[4193.72 - 4199.76] and you understand your body as it cries
[4196.52 - 4202.20] for help and asks you please when you're
[4199.76 - 4203.60] on the same page with your body then
[4202.20 - 4207.00] you're in the
[4203.60 - 4210.00] game see that's what matters in order to
[4207.00 - 4213.12] let the good things in life remain when
[4210.00 - 4216.08] you have the tools and you apply them
[4213.12 - 4218.72] right you are unstoppable against evil
[4216.08 - 4221.20] and you're gaining all the Insight
[4218.72 - 4223.72] because as they drop that stuff down on
[4221.20 - 4226.52] us you can laugh at it as it's coming on
[4223.72 - 4228.52] on down it's not going to get in your
[4226.52 - 4232.16] way because you're taking care of
[4228.52 - 4235.28] yourself now you can say I'm in control
[4232.16 - 4238.24] of my life I got the wisdom I got the
[4235.28 - 4240.68] Deep spiritual Insight I have control
[4238.24 - 4244.08] over my well-being you're not going to
[4240.68 - 4247.36] take control over me see I can live my
[4244.08 - 4249.72] life the way I want to be and keep from
[4247.36 - 4253.16] getting sick and recover if I've been
[4249.72 - 4256.20] sickened if need be I'm not blind when I
[4253.16 - 4260.04] look at the sky the Wall's not over my
[4256.20 - 4262.88] eyes anymore I can see past the Horizon
[4260.04 - 4265.80] I could see past the madness I can see
[4262.88 - 4268.64] past the smoke and see past the fog I
[4265.80 - 4271.48] can use my own free will to determine
[4268.64 - 4274.88] where life is going to go for me I can
[4271.48 - 4277.96] fight to be free and heal my body and
[4274.88 - 4281.24] see the path where it's going for me
[4277.96 - 4284.48] remember this your body has the power to
[4281.24 - 4288.20] heal and can override through thick and
[4284.48 - 4291.28] thin and our bodies fight for us as we
[4288.20 - 4295.04] acknowledge and validate our B's fight
[4291.28 - 4301.20] along the way then nothing can get in
[4295.04 - 4303.68] the way see I believe in you and I know
[4301.20 - 4303.68] you can
