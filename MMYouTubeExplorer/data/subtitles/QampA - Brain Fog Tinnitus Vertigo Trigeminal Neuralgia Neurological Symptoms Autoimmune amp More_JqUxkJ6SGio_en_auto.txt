[161.96 - 166.40] many people got tontis who's got the
[163.64 - 168.44] ringing in the ears when decibal damage
[166.40 - 171.56] has been ruled out I'm reading right out
[168.44 - 173.04] of here a little bit just so you know
[171.56 - 175.32] when deciel damage you know what I mean
[173.04 - 176.88] by that like decible damage where you
[175.32 - 180.48] around loud
[176.88 - 183.36] Machinery every single person back 20
[180.48 - 186.92] years ago 30 years ago whatever every
[183.36 - 189.72] single person who had ringing in the ear
[186.92 - 193.24] or some kind of like sound going off in
[189.72 - 195.72] the a or some kind of buzzing were told
[193.24 - 197.60] they were like deciel damaged by
[195.72 - 201.04] something were you around Machinery were
[197.60 - 204.40] you around this did did a baseball were
[201.04 - 206.32] you at a baseball park and a baseball
[204.40 - 209.44] flew and hit you in the head did it hit
[206.32 - 211.00] you in the ear ma'am that's how it was
[209.44 - 213.04] people have no idea about this how it
[211.00 - 215.76] worked the medical industry and you go
[213.04 - 218.36] to the doctor's office back boom years
[215.76 - 222.48] ago and you had ringing in the years it
[218.36 - 225.48] was always a diagnosis of well you have
[222.48 - 228.08] a damaged ear because you must have
[225.48 - 230.28] listen to loud music way too much loud
[228.08 - 232.76] music before and so people are always
[230.28 - 235.48] told that it's like loud music gave me
[232.76 - 237.24] the the ringing the year gave me the t9s
[235.48 - 240.32] and you know not only that the New Age
[237.24 - 243.76] movement really really spelled out the
[240.32 - 245.32] whole ringing in the a as as something's
[243.76 - 247.64] talking to you or somebody's talking to
[245.32 - 249.08] you or it's a message right and that
[247.64 - 251.08] happened all the time too it's these
[249.08 - 253.16] people would suffer from the worst ttis
[251.08 - 255.64] and then they would go to like a psychic
[253.16 - 258.44] and then the psychic would be like well
[255.64 - 260.28] that's because you know things are
[258.44 - 261.84] talking to you that's because fairies
[260.28 - 263.64] are talking to you that's be you're
[261.84 - 265.80] ringing in the ears because something's
[263.64 - 268.72] talking to you or somebody's talking
[265.80 - 270.32] about you and that happened too so it
[268.72 - 272.72] was all this confus you went to the
[270.32 - 274.60] regular doctor with ttis and you were
[272.72 - 276.28] told you just have a damaged Year from
[274.60 - 278.04] loud music and then you're trying to
[276.28 - 280.12] think about when did I listen to of loud
[278.04 - 282.80] music well when I was in college I
[280.12 - 285.68] listened to loud music maybe uh I worked
[282.80 - 287.24] around Machinery did I what's going on
[285.68 - 290.00] and then when you went to like the new
[287.24 - 293.04] age kind of situation you were just told
[290.00 - 296.92] a your head was chopped off in England
[293.04 - 299.32] in 1607 or you know your head was put on
[296.92 - 303.76] a pike or something in you know the Dark
[299.32 - 305.40] Age ages in the 800s ad and whatever it
[303.76 - 309.08] was that's why you had the ringing in
[305.40 - 311.76] the ear okay or you got fairies talking
[309.08 - 313.92] about you or someone's talking about you
[311.76 - 315.64] somewhere else and that was the answers
[313.92 - 318.48] you got that was
[315.64 - 321.12] it honest to God that was the answers
[318.48 - 323.32] you got back 20 years ago 30 years ago
[321.12 - 325.20] when you had ringing the ears and
[323.32 - 327.48] tonight so let's go into it a little bit
[325.20 - 329.60] okay when decibel damage has been ruled
[327.48 - 332.16] out like you really didn't have an
[329.60 - 333.84] injury like there wasn't a serious car
[332.16 - 336.92] accident and your head was smashed
[333.84 - 340.28] against you know the car
[336.92 - 341.92] door right and you haven't worked around
[340.28 - 343.28] heavy machinery for many years how many
[341.92 - 344.56] of you guys got tonight is how many of
[343.28 - 346.16] you guys got ring in the ears whooing in
[344.56 - 349.00] the ears buzzing in the ears humming in
[346.16 - 352.56] the ears vibration in the ears
[349.00 - 354.68] right and um or you didn't work in the
[352.56 - 356.40] like work in the music industry that's
[354.68 - 359.60] another one too or were you at a lot of
[356.40 - 361.76] live concerts like lots of live concerts
[359.60 - 364.60] like heavy metal or had a physical
[361.76 - 367.76] injury right if none of that happened on
[364.60 - 370.36] a regular basis then when you Reed the
[367.76 - 371.60] tentis diagnosis because of the humming
[370.36 - 374.52] and everything
[371.60 - 378.20] else people would be like what is it but
[374.52 - 382.08] what it is is viral inflammation mystery
[378.20 - 383.68] ttis is viral
[382.08 - 387.48] inflammation
[383.68 - 390.48] viruses inflaming the Labyrinth
[387.48 - 394.04] inflaming different areas of the ear the
[390.48 - 396.24] inner ear okay so that that is what it
[394.04 - 398.12] is tonius doesn't have to be ringing in
[396.24 - 400.56] the ear it could be humming buzzing how
[398.12 - 403.28] many of you guys got like buzzing or
[400.56 - 406.08] humming right pounding tontis whoa
[403.28 - 407.56] Restless Soul you got that yeah that's
[406.08 - 410.40] awful when it's like that where it's
[407.56 - 412.84] pounding that's terrible em then Nicole
[410.40 - 415.84] says that sounds like me but I never
[412.84 - 418.56] have been around machines nor loud music
[415.84 - 420.28] yeah and you know to this day they still
[418.56 - 423.88] say that they'll be like were you around
[420.28 - 426.92] loud music were you around machines you
[423.88 - 429.60] know um Mrs Jones were you listening to
[426.92 - 433.24] loud music cuz I think that's what it is
[429.60 - 435.80] everything else checks out fine so
[433.24 - 439.04] fluttering in the air crackling
[435.80 - 441.52] fluttering check this out vibrating
[439.04 - 444.72] popping crazy
[441.52 - 447.04] popping okay how about that I'm not
[444.72 - 448.88] talking about where you just had the flu
[447.04 - 449.92] and all that mucus is going through you
[448.88 - 451.96] know what I'm talking talking about when
[449.92 - 453.56] someone gets a flu and all that mucus is
[451.96 - 455.88] kind of moving through and they're just
[453.56 - 457.64] so sick they feel like they're congested
[455.88 - 459.64] their whole head is congested they're
[457.64 - 462.60] their face is congested just everything
[459.64 - 465.40] is like every sinus cavity sinuses
[462.60 - 466.96] everywhere completely clogged up and as
[465.40 - 469.04] the stuff's moving in the middle of the
[466.96 - 471.56] night you might hear a pop you can't
[469.04 - 473.76] hear good and then you hear a pop right
[471.56 - 475.88] that happens because you're sick right
[473.76 - 477.12] you're sick with that flu or C or
[475.88 - 480.00] something like
[477.12 - 482.48] that Reena Robinson say says I healed my
[480.00 - 485.36] tenius Because of You explanation point
[482.48 - 487.52] Thank you thank you for being here thank
[485.36 - 489.72] you for your comment that's
[487.52 - 493.52] awesome but if you don't have like the
[489.72 - 495.12] flu and you know and c and whatever if
[493.52 - 498.40] you don't have any of that and you're
[495.12 - 502.08] getting popping or ringing or fluttering
[498.40 - 505.52] or crackling or whoosing whoosing I
[502.08 - 507.80] never heard whoosing described until the
[505.52 - 510.00] medical medium books were published
[507.80 - 513.64] never heard that and I heard somebody
[510.00 - 516.32] running an ad recently on
[513.64 - 519.20] IG and they were just like whoosing in
[516.32 - 522.60] the a I'm like
[519.20 - 525.24] really never heard that one before out
[522.60 - 527.80] there when someone has the high pitch
[525.24 - 530.60] ringing in the ear it can change alter
[527.80 - 532.08] and dance about this is one thing that
[530.60 - 536.48] that's really hard on tonight's
[532.08 - 540.12] sufferers When someone tells me aw I got
[536.48 - 544.40] ttis okay look if first thing that comes
[540.12 - 548.60] to my mind is the whole
[544.40 - 550.52] dancing that whole dancing sound okay
[548.60 - 552.88] because when you have tenius and that
[550.52 - 556.60] ringing is going on all you need is
[552.88 - 558.92] background noise like a fan going or the
[556.60 - 562.04] refrigerator starts running do you know
[558.92 - 564.40] about this or your laundry is running in
[562.04 - 568.04] the back there something you got your
[564.40 - 570.00] laundry running and it changes the tone
[568.04 - 571.72] of the ringing now not for everybody but
[570.00 - 574.36] there's a lot of cases where people and
[571.72 - 575.76] it's changing their tone it's going like
[574.36 - 579.28] instead of
[575.76 - 581.40] like it's going
[579.28 - 583.52] like it's doing this thing where it's
[581.40 - 585.56] going crazy all over the place if some
[583.52 - 588.28] Fan's going and air conditioning is
[585.56 - 590.32] running if something's like happening if
[588.28 - 592.12] there's some wind or something or you
[590.32 - 594.64] got a window open and there's a plane
[592.12 - 597.56] flying by it Alters the
[594.64 - 599.76] tentis and if you're just laying there
[597.56 - 601.20] in bed or laying there on the couch or
[599.76 - 603.36] trying to fall asleep at night with the
[601.20 - 606.76] ttis and the ringing what happens is
[603.36 - 609.04] that any noise can alter the ringing and
[606.76 - 610.64] and shift it up to the point where it
[609.04 - 612.44] makes it so you can't go to sleep so you
[610.64 - 614.44] actually have a difficult time falling
[612.44 - 616.00] asleep or going to sleep that's really
[614.44 - 618.04] hard it's like the first thing comes to
[616.00 - 620.00] my mind is are you tortured by that
[618.04 - 622.40] because so many people get tortured by
[620.00 - 624.36] that oh my God James says oh my God yes
[622.40 - 626.16] right and here's one right here that you
[624.36 - 628.64] might not even have heard and maybe you
[626.16 - 631.68] experienced this right Denise said that
[628.64 - 635.16] is exact my problem yes I have that too
[631.68 - 637.32] Vanessa whoa whoa and here's the thing
[635.16 - 639.76] though you guys check this out this is a
[637.32 - 641.12] big deal right here and and maybe you
[639.76 - 644.88] experienced this maybe you didn't
[641.12 - 646.64] experience this all right but tonius
[644.88 - 651.40] there's a variety of
[646.64 - 653.68] ttis okay that when the sound is going
[651.40 - 657.28] right
[653.68 - 661.28] that that if there is a fan
[657.28 - 665.56] running or an A running or something
[661.28 - 669.96] blowing air or some noise it can alter
[665.56 - 672.28] the ringing and turn into songs so you
[669.96 - 674.16] actually can recognize some of the
[672.28 - 677.40] ringing where the ringing starts to
[674.16 - 679.52] fluctuate so much you hear music in the
[677.40 - 681.92] ringing but yet there's no music you're
[679.52 - 684.76] not there's no music playing nobody's
[681.92 - 688.72] playing music but you're hearing music
[684.76 - 689.68] within it so as it's doing that right so
[688.72 - 691.68] I I don't know if you've ever
[689.68 - 693.48] experienced that but that's a hard one
[691.68 - 696.04] for a lot of people where they hear
[693.48 - 698.68] songs within their ttis but there's no
[696.04 - 701.04] music playing but they hear Melodies
[698.68 - 703.40] going up and down these Melodies these
[701.04 - 705.56] chains of Melodies going up and down and
[703.40 - 707.40] songs they can recognize through the
[705.56 - 710.92] ringing in the ear that's being altered
[707.40 - 712.92] by a fan but yet it's not no song that's
[710.92 - 714.84] playing there's no song that's going on
[712.92 - 718.20] no one has the music on but you're
[714.84 - 721.96] hearing it and that that's just really
[718.20 - 724.20] really bizarre how it does that Molly
[721.96 - 727.04] says Rell says over there on YouTube I'm
[724.20 - 731.28] healing my ttis with your information aw
[727.04 - 733.16] I rarely have ringing my ears now so you
[731.28 - 736.28] really have rarely have ringing in your
[733.16 - 740.72] ears now so much healing has happened
[736.28 - 743.44] thank you aw and so s so so appreciates
[740.72 - 746.76] that Janessa says what about air candle
[743.44 - 750.80] burning along with the ringing okay good
[746.76 - 753.64] question right there okay um not into
[750.80 - 755.12] the the air you know air Canal I see
[753.64 - 756.80] that okay not the air candle I want to
[755.12 - 759.16] tell you about air candles too okay
[756.80 - 761.32] that's something that's important was on
[759.16 - 762.80] my mind the other day too is that makes
[761.32 - 765.48] tonight's
[762.80 - 769.12] worse so ear
[765.48 - 771.68] candles actually make tenius worse I'm
[769.12 - 773.28] forewarning people right there because a
[771.68 - 775.28] lot of people do that well they'll
[773.28 - 777.64] they'll burn the the candle they'll
[775.28 - 779.44] stick it in their ear and they'll do
[777.64 - 784.04] that practice PR practice has been
[779.44 - 786.12] around for a long time it worsens
[784.04 - 788.48] tenius aggravates it because the
[786.12 - 792.12] Labyrinth if the inner ear is so
[788.48 - 794.48] inflamed that when you're doing that it
[792.12 - 797.76] aggravates that inflammation that's
[794.48 - 801.04] already hot wire don't do the air the
[797.76 - 803.40] ear candle burning thing that's
[801.04 - 807.04] something I wanted to you know
[803.40 - 809.68] say um Kelly says this is mind-blowing
[807.04 - 812.80] information I'm honored I'm glad you're
[809.68 - 815.80] here so on the music front I want to
[812.80 - 817.96] just cover that for another second okay
[815.80 - 819.80] um that's a difficult tonight is for a
[817.96 - 823.12] lot of people because as they're trying
[819.80 - 825.92] to sleep or rest they're catching those
[823.12 - 828.00] songs and those rhythms and The Melody
[825.92 - 830.12] of that rigging going into all these
[828.00 - 832.64] songs and tunes that they actually can
[830.12 - 835.92] recognize and sometimes recognize or not
[832.64 - 837.40] sure but yet there's no music playing
[835.92 - 839.04] and that one right there is difficult
[837.40 - 845.24] for a lot of people I don't know if
[839.04 - 847.48] you've ever had that before you know um
[845.24 - 848.76] see all right let's go let's move into
[847.48 - 853.52] it a little
[848.76 - 855.12] bit okay all right when someone has the
[853.52 - 857.08] high pitch ringing in the ear it can
[855.12 - 859.20] change alter and dance about when a fan
[857.08 - 860.68] or air conditioner is on and music is
[859.20 - 862.80] playing some people experience what
[860.68 - 867.68] sounds like air rushing through their
[862.80 - 869.36] ear air rushing through their ear
[867.68 - 871.68] like
[869.36 - 873.20] then it backs down or it stays there
[871.68 - 875.08] permanently it's a ttis without the
[873.20 - 877.60] ringing so I want to cover that for a
[875.08 - 880.44] second do you guys know of that like do
[877.60 - 882.92] do some of you have the ttis without the
[880.44 - 886.12] ringing how about that well there's no
[882.92 - 886.12] ringing but there's a
[890.72 - 896.84] constant that's there all the time okay
[894.88 - 899.04] all right some people experiencing
[896.84 - 901.76] popping like they're popping pop popcorn
[899.04 - 904.76] in the ear pop tonight us can vary from
[901.76 - 906.24] mild to extreme some people get small
[904.76 - 908.52] moments when they hear a ringing in the
[906.24 - 910.80] ear and it goes away this has been
[908.52 - 914.24] pasted office someone's speaking about
[910.80 - 915.88] you that's what everybody said and the
[914.24 - 917.92] problem is with that one where someone
[915.88 - 919.40] is speaking about you and you got a ring
[917.92 - 921.04] in the ear and it's like someone's
[919.40 - 923.92] talking about you the problem is with
[921.04 - 927.96] that is that
[923.92 - 929.20] early early sufferers of tontis in their
[927.96 - 932.56] very early
[929.20 - 935.56] stages who get just a
[932.56 - 937.68] quick and it goes away it's like someone
[935.56 - 941.44] must be talking about
[937.68 - 944.92] me and it goes away well those people
[941.44 - 946.44] end up hearing it more a year later like
[944.92 - 948.24] there a little more it's like whoa
[946.44 - 950.76] someone's talking about me again but a
[948.24 - 952.56] lot more today another year later
[950.76 - 954.28] someone's talking about me a lot this
[952.56 - 957.56] week like twice this
[954.28 - 959.88] week a year goes by another year goes by
[957.56 - 962.52] someone's talking about me like once a
[959.88 - 965.44] day wow what's going on and then boom
[962.52 - 968.80] they got ttis and now they're ringing
[965.44 - 971.12] all the time it was just basically early
[968.80 - 973.00] warnings and then finally it went into
[971.12 - 975.68] chronic ttis and now they're like I
[973.00 - 979.52] guess nobody was talking about me darn
[975.68 - 982.20] it it was tonius all these
[979.52 - 984.40] years what most of okay so here's
[982.20 - 986.24] another thing too all right let's see
[984.40 - 989.08] sometimes it takes years of intermittent
[986.24 - 991.36] ringing in the ears to be diagnosed with
[989.08 - 992.72] ttis like okay here's another thing too
[991.36 - 993.72] you go to the doctor like I got a ring
[992.72 - 994.76] in the ears it doesn't mean you're going
[993.72 - 998.08] to get a
[994.76 - 1000.12] ttis diagnosis at all you know I'm
[998.08 - 1003.52] reading out of the brain someone asked
[1000.12 - 1005.84] just now um I'm reading out of the brain
[1003.52 - 1008.84] saver book it's an Incredible
[1005.84 - 1011.12] Book it'll blow your mind this book be
[1008.84 - 1012.36] prepared when you get it it's so packed
[1011.12 - 1015.56] with
[1012.36 - 1018.64] information um such a great book
[1015.56 - 1021.08] life-saving life saving tool seriously
[1018.64 - 1025.16] Epstein bar is the number one reason why
[1021.08 - 1030.04] people have mystery tontis Epstein
[1025.16 - 1033.96] bar yes EBV is the number one
[1030.04 - 1038.80] reason why most people have tentis it's
[1033.96 - 1043.40] epine bar getting into the ear working
[1038.80 - 1045.44] its way on the nerve root hairs so the
[1043.40 - 1047.48] nerve rout here so let's go into that a
[1045.44 - 1050.96] little bit another way it does it
[1047.48 - 1051.76] through neur toxins look it here I got a
[1050.96 - 1054.64] quick
[1051.76 - 1059.44] board all
[1054.64 - 1062.84] right so that nerve channel in the ear
[1059.44 - 1064.40] okay what happens is when a virus gets
[1062.84 - 1067.08] to that nerve
[1064.40 - 1069.80] Channel and it
[1067.08 - 1072.92] does so when that virus gets to the
[1069.80 - 1074.84] nerve Channel there you are the Epstein
[1072.92 - 1077.88] bar
[1074.84 - 1080.28] EBV right when it finally gets to that
[1077.88 - 1083.40] nerve Channel Channel and it gets into
[1080.28 - 1085.28] those nerves and gets into the
[1083.40 - 1088.24] Labyrinth right
[1085.28 - 1090.16] there it clings on to it but it only
[1088.24 - 1093.48] clings on to it if you got root hair
[1090.16 - 1097.36] sticking out a lot of people have frayed
[1093.48 - 1099.04] nerves in their ear channels Fray nerves
[1097.36 - 1102.20] little root hairs popping out you see
[1099.04 - 1104.64] these root hairs and as you get older
[1102.20 - 1106.84] and you're not taking care of yourself
[1104.64 - 1112.00] and all the stuff's happening you get
[1106.84 - 1113.56] more Fray on that nerve and that Fray
[1112.00 - 1117.00] that's on that nerve right see the
[1113.56 - 1119.80] little Fray stuff what happens is the
[1117.00 - 1122.64] viruses look for that the Epstein bar
[1119.80 - 1126.08] looks for that it goes and it finds that
[1122.64 - 1130.24] root hair coming off the
[1126.08 - 1133.72] nerve sticks on there camps out makes a
[1130.24 - 1136.20] home and then when it makes a home you
[1133.72 - 1139.08] get a whole bunch of
[1136.20 - 1142.68] inflammation in that area
[1139.08 - 1144.28] now that nerve is inflamed just like
[1142.68 - 1146.00] that and the whole nerve can get
[1144.28 - 1151.28] inflamed it's
[1146.00 - 1156.56] inflamed it ends up making noise yes it
[1151.28 - 1160.12] vibrates what you're hearing are bugs in
[1156.56 - 1165.36] the ear you're actually physically
[1160.12 - 1168.00] hearing bugs on the nerve vibrating
[1165.36 - 1170.56] because it's such a sensitive area where
[1168.00 - 1173.00] you can hear the inflamed nerve because
[1170.56 - 1176.36] of the bugs so that's what happens right
[1173.00 - 1176.36] there move this
[1176.80 - 1181.60] over
[1178.40 - 1183.20] okay A lot of times too if the bug
[1181.60 - 1185.32] doesn't get in there yet and it's
[1183.20 - 1188.48] releasing a lot of neurotoxins that's
[1185.32 - 1192.84] Epstein bar feeding off of mercury
[1188.48 - 1195.24] aluminum copper herbicides fungicides
[1192.84 - 1198.40] and whatever and fragrances when the
[1195.24 - 1200.96] epine bar is feeding off of that and
[1198.40 - 1203.92] that's releasing all this
[1200.96 - 1207.56] poison that poison can get in there and
[1203.92 - 1211.48] inflame both ears and you got tentis in
[1207.56 - 1212.44] both ears just ringing ringing ringing
[1211.48 - 1214.88] once
[1212.44 - 1217.96] neurotoxins released from the
[1214.88 - 1222.76] virus they have an injuring effect on
[1217.96 - 1226.12] the canal nerves nerves of the inner ear
[1222.76 - 1228.32] so clear nerve that one these nerves can
[1226.12 - 1230.84] swell from the neurotoxins constantly
[1228.32 - 1234.00] saturating them so neurotoxins from the
[1230.84 - 1235.84] viruses saturate the neres so that takes
[1234.00 - 1240.04] us to this right
[1235.84 - 1244.36] here okay so you got a nerve right here
[1240.04 - 1244.36] nice new nerve right there it gets
[1244.60 - 1249.36] inflamed
[1246.20 - 1252.52] okay and neurotoxins from the viruses
[1249.36 - 1254.64] that get released out of the viruses all
[1252.52 - 1255.36] that poo that comes out of the viruses
[1254.64 - 1258.68] right
[1255.36 - 1261.92] there it ends up getting on the nerves
[1258.68 - 1264.20] and it just inflames it so neurotoxins
[1261.92 - 1266.68] as well all
[1264.20 - 1269.72] right see guys I'll show you that right
[1266.68 - 1272.52] there all right let's move on so when it
[1269.72 - 1275.40] comes down to you know healing ttis
[1272.52 - 1278.52] killing off the viruses is
[1275.40 - 1281.44] critical that is important killing off
[1278.52 - 1283.44] the viruses is critical so there's
[1281.44 - 1286.24] different protocols right here so I have
[1283.44 - 1288.96] protocols for that in the protocols book
[1286.24 - 1291.64] here got them also in medical Med M book
[1288.96 - 1294.64] one New Edition there are protocols in
[1291.64 - 1297.88] here to adhere to if you adhere to them
[1294.64 - 1299.88] and work with them um you can be like
[1297.88 - 1303.16] thousands of others that got rid of
[1299.88 - 1306.16] their tenius like gone like bye Gone
[1303.16 - 1309.40] With the Wind just that's it moved on
[1306.16 - 1311.56] with their lives out of that tontis
[1309.40 - 1313.88] problem okay over there on YouTube My
[1311.56 - 1315.44] vertigo is gone with medical medium
[1313.88 - 1318.96] vertigo let's talk about vertigo for a
[1315.44 - 1323.16] little bit too so all right most cases
[1318.96 - 1325.64] of vertigo are caused by viral infection
[1323.16 - 1328.32] unless you have a serious physical
[1325.64 - 1331.32] injury or you've had a concussion and so
[1328.32 - 1333.44] forth like a injury exactly so most
[1331.32 - 1335.36] cases of vertigo are caused by viral
[1333.44 - 1339.40] infections some are caused by physical
[1335.36 - 1340.84] injury or a growth or a tumor right but
[1339.40 - 1342.12] if you're all cleared you went to the
[1340.84 - 1345.08] doctor and you're all cleared of a
[1342.12 - 1347.36] growth or a tumor and so forth okay and
[1345.08 - 1350.08] you're all good there you did not get
[1347.36 - 1351.88] into accident you didn't get to a car
[1350.08 - 1354.48] accident you didn't something didn't
[1351.88 - 1358.48] somebody didn't hit you you weren't you
[1354.48 - 1360.88] know seriously injured then that
[1358.48 - 1363.24] vertigo is
[1360.88 - 1366.44] viral it's important to
[1363.24 - 1368.28] know um unless you're having some crazy
[1366.44 - 1370.68] side effect from a
[1368.28 - 1373.40] medication something like that you know
[1370.68 - 1375.56] like some crazy side effects but even
[1373.40 - 1378.60] then you have to have a sensitive Vegas
[1375.56 - 1380.52] nerve or set of veg nerve that have to
[1378.60 - 1383.92] be you know
[1380.52 - 1385.84] sensitive um if no such thing exists you
[1383.92 - 1388.72] weren't injured and so forth and someone
[1385.84 - 1391.32] is dealing with mysterious vertigo
[1388.72 - 1393.72] mystery balance problems you feel like
[1391.32 - 1396.28] you're on a boat you feel dizzy you
[1393.72 - 1398.32] don't feel stable or you're getting the
[1396.28 - 1401.04] whole bed spins where you're laying on
[1398.32 - 1403.12] the couch or bed and it's going like
[1401.04 - 1404.20] this constantly so you got that vertigo
[1403.12 - 1406.32] where it's your you feel like your
[1404.20 - 1408.28] head's moving like this you shut your
[1406.32 - 1410.20] eyes and everything's moving moving
[1408.28 - 1412.36] around you know like that kind of
[1410.20 - 1414.44] vertigo which is brutal so many people
[1412.36 - 1416.92] suffer from that it's
[1414.44 - 1418.68] awful the theory goes that if you move
[1416.92 - 1421.96] your neck or head a certain way it
[1418.68 - 1425.88] disrupts the crystals and triggers a
[1421.96 - 1428.92] bout of vertigo so the medical industry
[1425.88 - 1430.28] believes vertigo get this important to
[1428.92 - 1433.12] know the medical industry believes
[1430.28 - 1436.40] vertigo is some kind of inner ear
[1433.12 - 1440.08] problem that may involve crystals and
[1436.40 - 1443.44] particles or stones inside the inner ear
[1440.08 - 1446.16] I called BS on that many many years ago
[1443.44 - 1449.72] and the industry is starting to shift
[1446.16 - 1451.84] oo published First Medical meme
[1449.72 - 1454.04] information but now they're saying
[1451.84 - 1457.68] maners which is
[1454.04 - 1460.64] vertigo man's disease may not be the
[1457.68 - 1462.60] stones that were in everybody's ears
[1460.64 - 1464.60] decade after decade after decade the
[1462.60 - 1466.20] stones that nobody saw that science
[1464.60 - 1468.68] never saw nobody saw them under a
[1466.20 - 1472.12] microscope they didn't exist the stones
[1468.68 - 1474.80] in their ears might not be it ooh viral
[1472.12 - 1477.96] inflammation looks like that might be
[1474.80 - 1479.48] what it is and so now it's changing
[1477.96 - 1481.04] they're taking medical meme info
[1479.48 - 1483.32] published first now they're saying like
[1481.04 - 1486.64] maners could be
[1483.32 - 1490.08] viral it is viral Theory goes on that if
[1486.64 - 1492.88] you move your neck right like you go get
[1490.08 - 1495.24] some help somebody works on you you move
[1492.88 - 1497.76] your neck and your head just right they
[1495.24 - 1499.52] try to adjust you maybe a chiropract
[1497.76 - 1501.20] doors adjusting you maybe you're going
[1499.52 - 1503.08] to massage therapist maybe you're going
[1501.20 - 1505.44] to a clinic where they actually have a
[1503.08 - 1507.40] system where you lay on the table they
[1505.44 - 1509.80] lock your head in and they they try to
[1507.40 - 1511.52] give you a jolt and they try to move
[1509.80 - 1513.56] your head in a certain way hopes that
[1511.52 - 1515.84] your vertigo goes
[1513.56 - 1518.76] away that's
[1515.84 - 1520.36] scary then the the the whole theory
[1518.76 - 1523.96] behind it was the crystals would
[1520.36 - 1526.40] actually move so the stones in your ears
[1523.96 - 1528.52] would move they try to move your head
[1526.40 - 1530.56] around a certain way shake your head
[1528.52 - 1531.68] around and everything they hope that the
[1530.56 - 1534.40] stones
[1531.68 - 1537.96] move but they don't move because they
[1534.40 - 1541.32] never existed there are no stones and
[1537.96 - 1543.64] crystals that get in the way that create
[1541.32 - 1545.20] vertigo the real
[1543.64 - 1549.24] cause
[1545.20 - 1552.92] Indiana says YouTube in the podcast you
[1549.24 - 1555.76] mentioned global cooling but the ice is
[1552.92 - 1558.68] melting in the ocean temperature is
[1555.76 - 1561.20] rising please explain
[1558.68 - 1564.36] and much love well that's a good
[1561.20 - 1566.36] question right there okay but yeah in
[1564.36 - 1568.40] the podcast global cooling is what's
[1566.36 - 1571.08] happening because what's going on is the
[1568.40 - 1573.80] atmosphere and this is important to know
[1571.08 - 1577.48] first of all caps are melting from the
[1573.80 - 1579.88] hole in the ozone okay because that's
[1577.48 - 1582.96] the whole thing the ozone layer right
[1579.88 - 1584.92] the atmosphere is basically dissolved on
[1582.96 - 1588.60] on the opposite spectrums of the planet
[1584.92 - 1591.16] okay so it's the one reason why and the
[1588.60 - 1593.08] the Chemtrails aren't saturating up
[1591.16 - 1594.56] there they're not D they're not dumping
[1593.08 - 1597.56] chemtrail after chemtrail after
[1594.56 - 1599.08] chemtrail over the Bergs that's really
[1597.56 - 1601.92] important to know right listen to the
[1599.08 - 1604.08] podcast and I'll go into more about that
[1601.92 - 1606.44] too sometime so check out the podcast
[1604.08 - 1607.32] episode in in medical mean podcast at
[1606.44 - 1609.40] Apple
[1607.32 - 1611.12] podcast but it's important to know
[1609.40 - 1613.00] what's happening with that okay but yes
[1611.12 - 1615.00] we're getting global cooling we're
[1613.00 - 1618.76] getting poorer
[1615.00 - 1622.44] crops because it is getting cooler
[1618.76 - 1625.92] because the sky is filled with so much
[1622.44 - 1628.96] metal that they're dropping out of
[1625.92 - 1630.56] PLS the atmosphere is filled with so
[1628.96 - 1633.76] much
[1630.56 - 1637.20] metal that it's reflecting the
[1633.76 - 1639.40] Sun and the Earth is getting cooler
[1637.20 - 1642.00] because it's one of the reasons right
[1639.40 - 1644.36] there and yeah the Caps are melting
[1642.00 - 1647.28] because they're not dumping those Trails
[1644.36 - 1648.16] on the Caps they're not dumping them
[1647.28 - 1651.60] there
[1648.16 - 1655.16] number one plus that's where that that
[1651.60 - 1658.76] hole is that's why the burgs are melting
[1655.16 - 1660.40] faster All By Design anyway we'll go
[1658.76 - 1662.04] into like a deeper understanding and
[1660.40 - 1664.84] I'll go into details on that but I love
[1662.04 - 1667.36] talking about that it's just
[1664.84 - 1669.88] depressing all
[1667.36 - 1671.92] right the real cause of most case of
[1669.88 - 1674.60] vertigo is the epsteam bar virus because
[1671.92 - 1676.04] epine bar creates ttis and vertigo and a
[1674.60 - 1678.68] lot of people get
[1676.04 - 1681.60] both they get get both they get the
[1678.68 - 1682.88] tenius and the vertigo they get them
[1681.60 - 1685.88] both
[1682.88 - 1687.92] together yes and if they don't have them
[1685.88 - 1690.52] together in that moment they get them
[1687.92 - 1693.00] later together could start out with a
[1690.52 - 1695.84] vertigo Boop end up with tenius 5 years
[1693.00 - 1698.40] later start out with tenius Boop end up
[1695.84 - 1700.80] 10 years later with a vertigo or a year
[1698.40 - 1703.16] later they end up having both most
[1700.80 - 1706.24] people end up having both because epine
[1703.16 - 1708.44] bar creates a crap load of symptoms and
[1706.24 - 1713.08] has disrupted people's lives in so many
[1708.44 - 1716.00] ways what a really really annoying
[1713.08 - 1718.88] virus
[1716.00 - 1721.84] okay which area of the Vegas nerve is
[1718.88 - 1723.52] inflamed affects the variety of vertigo
[1721.84 - 1726.80] okay let's go into that a little bit
[1723.52 - 1729.84] we'll go into Vegas nerve talk a little
[1726.80 - 1732.84] bit about Vegas nerves okay
[1729.84 - 1732.84] whoa
[1733.76 - 1741.76] see well the best we can get for now now
[1738.80 - 1743.84] that's what happens when you use a wet
[1741.76 - 1747.40] sponge
[1743.84 - 1749.84] okay all right so you got your Vegas
[1747.40 - 1752.84] nerves yes Vegas
[1749.84 - 1752.84] nerves
[1753.04 - 1760.92] okay all right see what we got here your
[1757.32 - 1762.56] Vegas nerves you got your viruses epin
[1760.92 - 1766.08] bar
[1762.56 - 1769.52] virus Epstein bar virus loves the Vegas
[1766.08 - 1772.52] nerves typ in the chest tightness in the
[1769.52 - 1774.48] throat all kinds of different ver
[1772.52 - 1777.24] versions of
[1774.48 - 1780.36] gastroparesis yes Vegas
[1777.24 - 1782.36] nerves that's right so you got a A lot
[1780.36 - 1784.20] of people are just loaded with Epstein
[1782.36 - 1785.88] bar they're loaded with different
[1784.20 - 1787.80] varieties of Epstein bar they might have
[1785.88 - 1790.32] two varieties of Epstein bar here's one
[1787.80 - 1792.96] variety of Epstein bar here's a second
[1790.32 - 1794.96] variety of Epstein bar different strain
[1792.96 - 1798.24] then they might pick up a third
[1794.96 - 1801.20] one a lot of people have more than that
[1798.24 - 1802.84] okay different varieties of epine bar
[1801.20 - 1808.84] they release different varieties of
[1802.84 - 1808.84] poisons the poisons come out of the
[1809.32 - 1815.28] virus and as the poisons come out of the
[1812.08 - 1817.52] virus the poisons end up touching the
[1815.28 - 1821.72] vagus
[1817.52 - 1825.48] nerve okay the vagus nerves the poison
[1821.72 - 1828.52] ends up touching the nerves the nerves
[1825.48 - 1831.36] get inflamed and start to sweat
[1828.52 - 1836.20] when they start to swell vertigo
[1831.36 - 1838.40] occurs the higher the inflammation on
[1836.20 - 1840.40] the vagus nerves
[1838.40 - 1845.08] are brain
[1840.40 - 1847.96] stem cranial nerves the higher they
[1845.08 - 1850.88] are more problems with your
[1847.96 - 1853.56] vertigo the lower they are the vertigo
[1850.88 - 1856.48] can change and be different and
[1853.56 - 1858.48] shift so a lot of people might be
[1856.48 - 1860.32] swelling
[1858.48 - 1862.36] their Vegas nerves are
[1860.32 - 1867.28] swelling up
[1862.36 - 1871.08] higher creating a real crappy vertigo
[1867.28 - 1874.08] just downright ugly vertigo where
[1871.08 - 1877.44] they're throwing up they're puking their
[1874.08 - 1881.68] guts out because the vertigo is so bad
[1877.44 - 1885.52] okay some people the viral poison that
[1881.68 - 1887.72] comes out will inflame a lower section
[1885.52 - 1891.20] of their Vegas nerves
[1887.72 - 1892.80] and so their their dizziness and their
[1891.20 - 1894.36] balance issues are going to be different
[1892.80 - 1896.92] it's going to be a different type of
[1894.36 - 1901.08] vertigo so I want to kind of run that
[1896.92 - 1905.60] critical information I find it's
[1901.08 - 1905.60] critical I find it's critical in
[1907.52 - 1912.92] information I mean I do I can't say
[1910.40 - 1915.04] everybody thinks it is but I think it is
[1912.92 - 1916.36] when you're suffering from vertigo and
[1915.04 - 1918.36] it's like driving you crazy you can't
[1916.36 - 1920.52] drive anymore you can't do anything you
[1918.36 - 1922.52] got to like you you can't live your life
[1920.52 - 1923.92] the way you want to and you're living
[1922.52 - 1926.48] with this constant vertigo this
[1923.92 - 1929.48] dizziness this balance issue problem
[1926.48 - 1934.32] it's devastating it's
[1929.48 - 1938.12] devastating all right some rare cases of
[1934.32 - 1942.44] vertigo can be inflammation to the brain
[1938.12 - 1945.00] the brain stem higher okay mild
[1942.44 - 1948.20] undiagnosed incilius or even brain
[1945.00 - 1950.24] inflammation caused by a viral infection
[1948.20 - 1952.92] predominantly
[1950.24 - 1955.36] EBV vertigo symptoms can range from
[1952.92 - 1958.52] feeling like you're on a
[1955.36 - 1960.72] boat to not feeling balanced when you're
[1958.52 - 1963.08] walking to feel like you're falling
[1960.72 - 1965.72] forward that's another one too you're
[1963.08 - 1967.04] falling forward right that that falling
[1965.72 - 1970.84] forward
[1967.04 - 1973.52] thing and or you're walking sideways and
[1970.84 - 1976.76] you're like walking like this
[1973.52 - 1979.16] right and you're just gosh there's so
[1976.76 - 1982.88] many versions that just throw
[1979.16 - 1987.92] people it could become so severe that
[1982.88 - 1987.92] you get what I call the bed
[1987.96 - 1992.32] spins as you lie in bed the room is
[1990.44 - 1994.80] spinning or rocking back and forth when
[1992.32 - 1996.96] you shut your eyes you close your eyes
[1994.80 - 2000.24] and the room is literally
[1996.96 - 2003.60] spinning that is brutal some people live
[2000.24 - 2006.12] with that every day every waking day and
[2003.60 - 2008.80] sleeping day of their life it's awful
[2006.12 - 2010.72] some cases of ver or severe where you're
[2008.80 - 2013.04] vomiting where you get the vertigo
[2010.72 - 2014.68] attack and you're like
[2013.04 - 2018.96] vomiting
[2014.68 - 2021.60] awful it's a rough one and there's and
[2018.96 - 2023.52] okay so these are more acute viral
[2021.60 - 2026.04] infections where someone's immune system
[2023.52 - 2028.20] strength dropped and the EBV took over
[2026.04 - 2029.68] fast and now you're throwing up because
[2028.20 - 2032.00] you're really tripped up you're
[2029.68 - 2033.88] triggered so now you're really triggered
[2032.00 - 2036.48] into the vomiting one you're triggered
[2033.88 - 2038.88] into the bed spins it's when the viruses
[2036.48 - 2041.00] all of a sudden kind of explode and they
[2038.88 - 2045.12] proliferated to such a degree and so
[2041.00 - 2049.16] fast and they lit that Vagas nerve
[2045.12 - 2051.24] Channel up boom open the heel says I got
[2049.16 - 2054.08] hospitalized for vertigo several years
[2051.24 - 2056.92] back they had nothing for it they seem
[2054.08 - 2058.56] to never do Margie said falling forward
[2056.92 - 2060.12] yes and to the right so you got the
[2058.56 - 2062.12] falling to the right thing so it's
[2060.12 - 2064.12] falling forward into to the right yeah
[2062.12 - 2065.52] that's brutal that's that's really
[2064.12 - 2068.64] difficult and I'm sorry you actually
[2065.52 - 2071.92] have that that's brutal
[2068.64 - 2074.48] Susie Sunshine says it makes me want to
[2071.92 - 2076.80] die I've heard that I've heard that
[2074.48 - 2079.00] before because that's how bad it can be
[2076.80 - 2081.68] where it just takes away your quality of
[2079.00 - 2084.24] life and and you just feel like okay
[2081.68 - 2087.28] wait a minute I'm stuck with this it's
[2084.24 - 2089.84] just such a painful
[2087.28 - 2093.76] situation
[2089.84 - 2095.72] um okay in many cases it's not just EBV
[2093.76 - 2098.60] neurotoxins inflaming the Vegas nerve
[2095.72 - 2099.96] it's EBV itself so I showed you on the
[2098.60 - 2101.72] on the Whiteboard right there that it
[2099.96 - 2103.72] was toxins coming from the virus
[2101.72 - 2105.92] inflaming the Vegas nerves but it can
[2103.72 - 2107.88] also be the EP scene bar some cases
[2105.92 - 2109.60] there's different varieties of EP bar so
[2107.88 - 2111.56] if you take a look at this board really
[2109.60 - 2113.60] quick for a second you see one variety
[2111.56 - 2115.52] of EP bar right here the red little
[2113.60 - 2117.96] right red is the virus you see two
[2115.52 - 2120.20] variety of of the virus right there it's
[2117.96 - 2122.04] another variety you see three varieties
[2120.20 - 2125.20] right here it's another variety right
[2122.04 - 2127.32] there and so what happens is you can
[2125.20 - 2131.08] have one variety just infl
[2127.32 - 2134.88] the channel the veg nerves inflame it
[2131.08 - 2136.72] another variety of epine bar actually
[2134.88 - 2140.40] going on the nerve and that's an
[2136.72 - 2143.68] entirely different situation so you get
[2140.40 - 2146.36] another type okay so maybe you get
[2143.68 - 2150.00] another version of epine bar it's a
[2146.36 - 2151.60] different strain of evv okay and that
[2150.00 - 2156.48] one actually
[2151.60 - 2158.72] heads to the nerves and it clings on to
[2156.48 - 2161.36] the nerves and it inflames them directly
[2158.72 - 2165.08] and it takes time to heal it takes time
[2161.36 - 2166.08] to heal these you know it takes dis some
[2165.08 - 2168.60] dis
[2166.08 - 2172.04] discipline right some
[2168.60 - 2174.84] compliance it takes a little time but
[2172.04 - 2178.52] you can heal the one thing about medical
[2174.84 - 2180.44] medum information is people have healed
[2178.52 - 2181.84] it's not this whole thing does it work
[2180.44 - 2184.80] does it
[2181.84 - 2186.80] not no it works and that's the thing
[2184.80 - 2189.92] with medical Med information this book
[2186.80 - 2193.84] right here millions of people all around
[2189.92 - 2195.48] the globe everywhere who have this copy
[2193.84 - 2197.80] who turn their lives around over the
[2195.48 - 2199.72] decade who moved out of chronic illness
[2197.80 - 2200.96] who healed the vertigo and their ttis
[2199.72 - 2202.72] and so much more that we're talking
[2200.96 - 2205.08] about trigeminal neuralgia and brain fog
[2202.72 - 2210.12] and everything else they healed it
[2205.08 - 2213.36] healed I mean healed gone boom symptoms
[2210.12 - 2217.04] out of the way out of here carola
[2213.36 - 2220.08] says over there on x minus so
[2217.04 - 2222.16] life-altering so few people understand
[2220.08 - 2223.84] what we go through and it goes back to
[2222.16 - 2225.32] that unless you experience it yourself
[2223.84 - 2227.60] you won't know what the other person is
[2225.32 - 2228.92] going through you think they're crazy or
[2227.60 - 2229.92] you think there you don't even know what
[2228.92 - 2232.24] they're talking about it's like what do
[2229.92 - 2233.84] you mean you're dizzy go to the doctor
[2232.24 - 2236.20] that's what they'll say people will do
[2233.84 - 2237.52] that they'll say to somebody so you know
[2236.20 - 2239.24] you're telling me about this vertigo
[2237.52 - 2240.80] thing you got I don't understand it I
[2239.24 - 2242.56] don't know why you're so dizzy all the
[2240.80 - 2245.60] time go to IT doctor isn't it fixed
[2242.56 - 2248.40] already no it's not like that it's not
[2245.60 - 2250.48] easy the protocols in this book can be
[2248.40 - 2253.48] customized because it's not one siiz
[2250.48 - 2256.40] fits all keep that in mind but you can
[2253.48 - 2258.40] find your way through these books and I
[2256.40 - 2262.28] got the Brain book right here find your
[2258.40 - 2264.48] way through there and you can heal so so
[2262.28 - 2266.96] critical Kim Miller says your info is

[2281.68 - 2288.72] stopped after 33 years on medical medium
[2286.48 - 2291.12] the nerve shifter shot combined with
[2288.72 - 2295.12] three years of medical medium almost 5
[2291.12 - 2295.12] months without migraines

[2369.64 - 2376.00] move forward amazing all right let's
[2373.52 - 2379.68] talk about brain fog a little
[2376.00 - 2382.60] bit let's go there severe cases of brain
[2379.68 - 2382.60] fog can be
[2384.36 - 2389.76] devastating
[2385.92 - 2391.20] man I mean that line doesn't cut it
[2389.76 - 2393.72] doesn't cut it at
[2391.20 - 2397.80] all severe cases of brain fog can be
[2393.72 - 2399.72] devastating nope doesn't cut it
[2397.80 - 2402.08] terrifyingly
[2399.72 - 2403.92] devastating I should have put
[2402.08 - 2406.40] terrifyingly
[2403.92 - 2408.52] devastating because I've seen brain fog
[2406.40 - 2411.32] cases where you can't make yourself
[2408.52 - 2414.84] something to eat you can't walk
[2411.32 - 2417.84] somewhere you can't drive a car you're
[2414.84 - 2419.60] it just it creates Madness you just feel
[2417.84 - 2422.08] like you're losing yourself and you're
[2419.60 - 2423.48] losing hope brain fog can be oh I'm a
[2422.08 - 2426.44] little foggy I'm a little foggy I need
[2423.48 - 2428.36] my coffee you know use coffee to mask
[2426.44 - 2430.24] your problem you're living with brain
[2428.36 - 2431.84] fog you're struggling with brain fog you
[2430.24 - 2433.88] don't even really know it you have no
[2431.84 - 2435.80] idea but you need coffee because you
[2433.88 - 2437.52] can't function without the coffee
[2435.80 - 2439.52] without the caffeine taking over and
[2437.52 - 2442.60] running your adrenals and exploding your
[2439.52 - 2446.56] adrenals cuz that happens so brain
[2442.60 - 2449.88] Foggers are huge huge caffeine
[2446.56 - 2452.76] consumers huge caffeine consumers that's
[2449.88 - 2456.96] what they are and University student
[2452.76 - 2459.48] brain Foggers are Aderall consumers
[2456.96 - 2463.28] right they're they're medication
[2459.48 - 2466.28] consumers right 80% of the colleges it's
[2463.28 - 2468.80] everybody's on adol right so that's how
[2466.28 - 2471.16] it works that's how brain fog is masked
[2468.80 - 2476.24] brain fog is an epidemic all on its own
[2471.16 - 2479.28] out there big time I mean millions
[2476.24 - 2481.80] billions have brain fog
[2479.28 - 2484.48] billions 50 billion people on this
[2481.80 - 2487.76] planet have brain fog anybody catch that
[2484.48 - 2490.24] one yet did I contradict myself at all
[2487.76 - 2493.08] 50 billion people have brain fog on on
[2490.24 - 2494.92] planet Earth did you catch that one
[2493.08 - 2497.88] anybody going to put that one out there
[2494.92 - 2499.80] see I told you he's bad look he said 50
[2497.88 - 2503.32] billion people are on this planet no
[2499.80 - 2507.32] it's 8 point something said
[2503.32 - 2510.20] whatever um Deborah says my brain fog is
[2507.32 - 2512.44] gone with medical medium
[2510.20 - 2514.60] incredible the thing the thing is is
[2512.44 - 2518.24] that coffee will
[2514.60 - 2522.24] mask the
[2518.24 - 2525.52] illness and chocolate will mask the
[2522.24 - 2529.56] illness and matcha tea and green tea
[2525.52 - 2531.72] will mask and black tea the
[2529.56 - 2535.40] illness
[2531.72 - 2539.20] right and there we go Tom just said 50
[2535.40 - 2542.84] billion question mark and there it
[2539.20 - 2546.24] starts yeah so anyway so so many people
[2542.84 - 2547.96] have brain fog and they have to hide it
[2546.24 - 2550.52] by using the caffeine but what happens
[2547.96 - 2552.60] is when you do that you're creating
[2550.52 - 2555.48] future brain
[2552.60 - 2557.64] fog and that really things Victoria
[2555.48 - 2560.56] Rising said but what do you mean by 50
[2557.64 - 2563.72] billion I am curious is it a joke or
[2560.56 - 2566.96] something else could be something else
[2563.72 - 2569.32] it's a joke though all
[2566.96 - 2572.16] right when your adrenals are sitting
[2569.32 - 2573.96] there every single day getting beaten
[2572.16 - 2579.68] down by the
[2573.96 - 2581.28] Aderall right and and in the prescribed
[2579.68 - 2583.24] amphetamines and they're just the
[2581.28 - 2587.48] adrenals are getting clobbered because
[2583.24 - 2590.60] they're squeezing every last bit of gold
[2587.48 - 2592.84] out of them so that the brain can
[2590.60 - 2595.84] override because what adrenaline is it's
[2592.84 - 2599.96] like basically fuel for the brain to
[2595.84 - 2602.16] override a problem and so the brain then
[2599.96 - 2603.84] kind of shakes out of the brain fog so
[2602.16 - 2605.72] whatever those metals that are in there
[2603.84 - 2609.84] creating brain fog toxic heavy metals
[2605.72 - 2612.60] Mercury aluminum copper lead cadmium
[2609.84 - 2614.00] arsenic right all those toxic heavy
[2612.60 - 2617.24] metals that are in the
[2614.00 - 2620.96] brain they're creating a problem in the
[2617.24 - 2624.12] brain and then you do the
[2620.96 - 2625.24] caffeine and you do the amphetamines
[2624.12 - 2627.64] prescribed
[2625.24 - 2630.20] amphetamines and then the adrenals just
[2627.64 - 2632.28] explode right every single day like boom
[2630.20 - 2634.44] I need my adrenaline fixed and then the
[2632.28 - 2636.16] adrenaline shoots out and that
[2634.44 - 2637.92] adrenaline is strong stuff it's
[2636.16 - 2640.04] corrosive and it goes shoots right to
[2637.92 - 2641.80] the brain and when it gets into the
[2640.04 - 2644.68] brain it lights everything on fire the
[2641.80 - 2646.20] electrical grid gets lit right up boom
[2644.68 - 2648.12] and then it overrides the toxic heavy
[2646.20 - 2650.40] metal inflammation the to the viral
[2648.12 - 2652.04] inflammation the heavy load of toxins
[2650.40 - 2653.36] and poisons that are in the brain the
[2652.04 - 2655.48] fragrances and everything else that
[2653.36 - 2658.36] we're Poisoned With and then it moves
[2655.48 - 2660.48] that over in a way and it lights the
[2658.36 - 2662.76] grit up so you can start shaking out of
[2660.48 - 2665.24] that brain fog but you can get brain fog
[2662.76 - 2668.04] so bad that that doesn't work anymore
[2665.24 - 2670.32] and the amphetam means and the caffeine
[2668.04 - 2672.64] doesn't shake you out of it and then
[2670.32 - 2674.24] you're just in the pit you're just
[2672.64 - 2676.72] really in the pit struggling and
[2674.24 - 2678.96] suffering and then later
[2676.72 - 2681.40] on later
[2678.96 - 2685.48] on it gets
[2681.40 - 2688.00] worse 10 years later so you were 20 and
[2685.48 - 2689.40] you're in you're in you know college and
[2688.00 - 2690.92] you're 20 years old and you're using all
[2689.40 - 2693.12] the amphetamin in the caffeine and
[2690.92 - 2697.84] you're pushing through pushing through
[2693.12 - 2700.96] and you're robbing Peter to pay hey
[2697.84 - 2703.32] Paul and then 10 years later now you're
[2700.96 - 2705.20] 30 years old and you're Doctor shopping
[2703.32 - 2706.72] everywhere for every functional medicine
[2705.20 - 2708.76] doctor you can find on the planet or
[2706.72 - 2711.24] whatever conventional doctor because you
[2708.76 - 2713.32] got brain fog that's so bad and you want
[2711.24 - 2714.76] your medications to be like adjusted and
[2713.32 - 2716.96] you want your amphetamines to be
[2714.76 - 2719.84] adjusted and you want all
[2716.96 - 2722.68] that and it just gets worse worse from
[2719.84 - 2726.00] there and no one no one you know was
[2722.68 - 2730.52] going to be like let me help you and get
[2726.00 - 2730.52] you out of that and people just get
[2731.08 - 2737.60] stuck talking about brain
[2734.68 - 2740.32] fog are there other planets that have 50
[2737.60 - 2744.48] billion people on
[2740.32 - 2746.32] them certainly there are bigger
[2744.48 - 2748.68] planets
[2746.32 - 2751.04] okay all right I want to go into this a
[2748.68 - 2753.28] little bit one major factor behind brain
[2751.04 - 2754.88] fog is a liver that's saturated with
[2753.28 - 2757.60] toxic heavy
[2754.88 - 2759.24] metals Ed candles air fresheners
[2757.60 - 2762.32] fragrances
[2759.24 - 2764.64] pesticides herbicides other toxins and
[2762.32 - 2767.36] so forth so a
[2764.64 - 2771.76] liver that's saturated and soaked up
[2767.36 - 2774.40] clogged stagnant sluggish
[2771.76 - 2778.68] overheated burnt out
[2774.40 - 2781.80] fatty fatty liver all burnt up and then
[2778.68 - 2784.32] boom you can have brain fog just from
[2781.80 - 2786.56] that when Epstein bar feeds on these
[2784.32 - 2790.08] poisons neurotoxins get released and
[2786.56 - 2793.84] they go to the brain so what happens
[2790.08 - 2795.04] is when viruses such as epine bar feed
[2793.84 - 2798.48] off
[2795.04 - 2799.96] of right feed off of these poisons and
[2798.48 - 2801.28] the fragrances and all the different
[2799.96 - 2803.52] chemicals and the
[2801.28 - 2805.64] herbicides and everything else right and
[2803.52 - 2808.60] the metals and they feed off of them
[2805.64 - 2810.84] those chemicals those neurotoxins now
[2808.60 - 2812.72] being released from the viruses get into
[2810.84 - 2814.80] the neurons and now you're just fogged
[2812.72 - 2816.80] up and your grit's
[2814.80 - 2819.44] going it's
[2816.80 - 2821.68] happening P Robinson over there on
[2819.44 - 2823.88] YouTube I have been off caffeine for
[2821.68 - 2826.72] three years my sister is quitting now
[2823.88 - 2830.00] with help from medical medium but she
[2826.72 - 2833.76] didn't want to but knew it had to be
[2830.00 - 2836.32] done it's really hard my mother would be
[2833.76 - 2839.00] on a couch would be on couch Island
[2836.32 - 2841.00] without Aderall and
[2839.00 - 2843.72] coffee yeah it's
[2841.00 - 2847.04] brutal so many people would be on couch
[2843.72 - 2850.96] Island and only there without Aderall
[2847.04 - 2853.20] and coffee I know it's not their fault
[2850.96 - 2857.04] it's not the person's fault always
[2853.20 - 2859.80] remember that always remember that it's
[2857.04 - 2862.04] not and it's not easy out there
[2859.80 - 2863.48] neurotoxins have the ability to diminish
[2862.04 - 2865.32] neurotransmitter activity and
[2863.48 - 2867.60] neurotransmitter chemicals themselves
[2865.32 - 2869.36] meaning that when an electrical impulse
[2867.60 - 2871.32] tries to run down a neuron the
[2869.36 - 2873.24] electrical impulse can misfire as it's
[2871.32 - 2876.40] approaching any kind of contamination
[2873.24 - 2878.12] and inconsistent uh inconsistency see so
[2876.40 - 2880.44] what happens is that your electrical
[2878.12 - 2882.12] Grid in your brain right all that
[2880.44 - 2884.12] electricity spinning around and going
[2882.12 - 2885.80] through neurons all of a sudden hits all
[2884.12 - 2888.00] those toxins and poisons and all that
[2885.80 - 2890.24] garbage and then boom diminishes and
[2888.00 - 2892.96] when it diminishes you your brain fog
[2890.24 - 2895.20] gets worse and by 9:00 in the morning
[2892.96 - 2897.56] you slept a good night by 9:00 in the
[2895.20 - 2900.24] morning you're brain fogged again you
[2897.56 - 2902.64] woke up and were less brain fogged for a
[2900.24 - 2905.28] half an hour in the morning you got up
[2902.64 - 2907.88] at 7:30 8:00 in the morning you were up
[2905.28 - 2910.52] for half an hour your brain fog was not
[2907.88 - 2913.44] as bad by 10:00 in the morning it came
[2910.52 - 2915.60] on worse and worse electrical grid is
[2913.44 - 2917.72] circulating it's hitting more toxins and
[2915.60 - 2919.52] poisons after you had a good night's
[2917.72 - 2922.40] sleep it takes a few hours and then
[2919.52 - 2927.60] you're back in the saddle again into
[2922.40 - 2927.60] brain fog Nightmare and
[2929.20 - 2935.60] troubles another factor in brain fog is
[2932.96 - 2939.56] the heavy metal load inside the brain
[2935.60 - 2942.84] brain itself Metals that's why the
[2939.56 - 2947.04] hmds and the medical medium heavy metal
[2942.84 - 2950.16] detox and the the advanced and the
[2947.04 - 2952.56] regular and all of that in the medical
[2950.16 - 2955.48] medium books is critical heavy metal
[2952.56 - 2958.04] detox is critical for so many people you
[2955.48 - 2960.68] can't get out of the brain fog until you
[2958.04 - 2963.96] get the metals out until you get them
[2960.68 - 2967.24] out easily and safely without any
[2963.96 - 2968.76] problems that's how you heal you get
[2967.24 - 2970.32] through brain fog and you get through
[2968.76 - 2972.96] other conditions when you take those
[2970.32 - 2977.40] Metals out you move forward you get your
[2972.96 - 2977.40] life back that is critical
[2979.04 - 2982.56] critical
[2980.56 - 2986.20] indeed
[2982.56 - 2987.60] indeed another factor in brain fog was
[2986.20 - 2990.16] the
[2987.60 - 2993.64] metals and here's the problem like in
[2990.16 - 2995.20] the brain right here's the problem okay
[2993.64 - 2998.48] you can have Metals in one part of the
[2995.20 - 2999.84] brain tissue and then they move Metals
[2998.48 - 3004.24] actually
[2999.84 - 3009.60] move they leech and they discard and
[3004.24 - 3012.68] they corrode and they out gas and they
[3009.60 - 3015.68] basically push out more
[3012.68 - 3017.80] metal like methyl metal off of the
[3015.68 - 3020.16] original metal itself and that metal
[3017.80 - 3022.08] leeches like a leech field into other
[3020.16 - 3024.80] neurons and other Leo cells and then the
[3022.08 - 3028.32] brain fog gets worse and worse and if
[3024.80 - 3030.16] it's not bought and cleaned up and no
[3028.32 - 3032.36] one's working on it and getting it out
[3030.16 - 3034.52] and getting the metals out and it ends
[3032.36 - 3036.80] up into a bigger problem down the road
[3034.52 - 3039.36] and then down the road a bigger problem
[3036.80 - 3039.36] and a bigger
[3039.72 - 3045.28] problem and that's how it
[3042.52 - 3048.24] rolls there's so much information in
[3045.28 - 3051.64] these books you guys you should get them
[3048.24 - 3054.44] if you can get them free at the library
[3051.64 - 3057.80] or go to amazon.com us or wherever you
[3054.44 - 3061.40] are they're on sale right now and
[3057.80 - 3064.12] there's protocols in these books so I
[3061.40 - 3066.36] have the
[3064.12 - 3068.16] protocol Brain book right here with all
[3066.36 - 3071.88] the protocols you want to get both of
[3068.16 - 3074.68] these it was one book two big the
[3071.88 - 3078.68] publisher wouldn't publish it two big
[3074.68 - 3082.68] books it became it was one massive
[3078.68 - 3086.40] book okay it's one massive
[3082.68 - 3089.20] book and then how to be
[3086.40 - 3089.20] turn into two
[3089.32 - 3095.12] books there you go customize a protocol
[3092.32 - 3098.20] for yourself take control over your
[3095.12 - 3099.88] health I know a lot of people they think
[3098.20 - 3101.76] okay what I'll go listen this person
[3099.88 - 3104.08] I'll go Len that person this person's
[3101.76 - 3105.56] selling this this person's doing that
[3104.08 - 3107.00] and it's like you get this like little
[3105.56 - 3108.40] fix here and a little fix here and a
[3107.00 - 3110.72] little fix there and then you just still
[3108.40 - 3113.52] you're still sick three years from now
[3110.72 - 3116.60] learn the information become your own
[3113.52 - 3119.16] expert become your own own
[3116.60 - 3120.88] expert that's what people need to do and

[3124.80 - 3131.52] this all
[3127.16 - 3133.76] right trigeminal neuralgia one of my
[3131.52 - 3136.28] favorites one of my favorites because
[3133.76 - 3137.52] when you heal somebody with brutal
[3136.28 - 3141.96] trigeminal
[3137.52 - 3145.32] neuralgia it is it the ultimate blessing
[3141.96 - 3148.16] it feels so good anybody struggling with
[3145.32 - 3150.36] trinal neurology long term do not lose
[3148.16 - 3155.04] Faith do not lose
[3150.36 - 3160.20] hope there is a way to
[3155.04 - 3162.16] heal important words you need to live by
[3160.20 - 3164.08] and have in your database your
[3162.16 - 3167.00] subconsciousness your Consciousness that
[3164.08 - 3170.76] there is a way to heal when it comes
[3167.00 - 3174.40] down to trigeminal neuralgia timeline
[3170.76 - 3177.16] right in time some people heal it fast
[3174.40 - 3179.24] some people need a few years when it's
[3177.16 - 3182.80] brutal and they've had it too me too
[3179.24 - 3186.80] long okay trinal neuralgia is one of
[3182.80 - 3188.24] those annoying annoying conditions very
[3186.80 - 3190.80] annoying
[3188.24 - 3193.88] because
[3190.80 - 3197.12] because when those nerves get inflamed
[3193.88 - 3200.68] they're in a really really sensitive
[3197.12 - 3202.64] spot real sensitive spot when they get
[3200.68 - 3205.36] inflamed
[3202.64 - 3210.08] okay so let's let's set up a set of
[3205.36 - 3210.08] nerves here trigeminal
[3211.28 - 3218.16] nerves get a set of trigeminal nerves
[3213.72 - 3220.80] here okay here we go looks like a
[3218.16 - 3223.28] heart indeed it
[3220.80 - 3227.20] is all
[3223.28 - 3229.24] right okay trigeminal
[3227.20 - 3231.68] neuralgia the
[3229.24 - 3236.24] shingles definitely interferes with
[3231.68 - 3238.44] these nerves greatly herpes simplex one
[3236.24 - 3243.08] definitely interferes with these nerves
[3238.44 - 3246.04] greatly leeching out poisons and
[3243.08 - 3248.04] toxins shingles virus a lot of people
[3246.04 - 3251.24] have different varieties I did I did a
[3248.04 - 3254.60] shingle live the other
[3251.24 - 3256.44] day okay here's little viruses
[3254.60 - 3259.92] everywhere all
[3256.44 - 3259.92] right some are
[3261.00 - 3267.32] shingles some are it's just be one
[3265.64 - 3271.00] herpy
[3267.32 - 3274.72] simplex and both these viruses have the
[3271.00 - 3277.60] ability to cling to the root hairs of
[3274.72 - 3282.04] the nerves so root
[3277.60 - 3284.40] hairs okay trinal nerves they root hair
[3282.04 - 3288.28] out very
[3284.40 - 3290.72] easily they do they Fray so keep that in
[3288.28 - 3293.24] mind it's why people suffer long
[3290.72 - 3294.72] term that's why they can have it so bad
[3293.24 - 3296.76] where they're getting you know they're
[3294.72 - 3299.08] getting injections in the back of their
[3296.76 - 3301.72] neck they're getting
[3299.08 - 3303.04] injections in their jaw I mean they're
[3301.72 - 3304.64] getting all kinds of different things
[3303.04 - 3306.88] all kinds of different
[3304.64 - 3309.60] therapies and what happens is the reason
[3306.88 - 3311.80] why they suffer from it long term is
[3309.60 - 3313.60] because the root hairs coming off of
[3311.80 - 3316.08] these
[3313.60 - 3320.08] nerves seem to be a little bit more than
[3316.08 - 3321.68] a lot of other nerves it frays easier
[3320.08 - 3323.36] that's what the trigeminal nerves do
[3321.68 - 3328.36] they Fray easier there's a lot of
[3323.36 - 3330.92] reasons for that but um when the viruses
[3328.36 - 3333.48] get on the trigeminal
[3330.92 - 3336.44] nerve they usually
[3333.48 - 3339.20] hit the molar
[3336.44 - 3341.64] areas
[3339.20 - 3343.28] molers those areas down in there in the
[3341.64 - 3345.56] jaw and that
[3343.28 - 3346.84] nerve so people end up getting tons of
[3345.56 - 3350.20] rot
[3346.84 - 3352.32] canals rot canals without needing a r
[3350.20 - 3355.16] Canal you need a rot Canal you need a
[3352.32 - 3356.88] rot Canal but people get a lot of of
[3355.16 - 3360.60] root
[3356.88 - 3363.24] canals when they don't need a root canal
[3360.60 - 3365.48] they get a lot of teeth drilled because
[3363.24 - 3368.48] their trigal neurologist so bad and back
[3365.48 - 3371.68] 20 years ago 30 years ago was huge huge
[3368.48 - 3374.48] mess a huge mess dentists always just
[3371.68 - 3376.72] pulled teeth or drilled teeth with any
[3374.48 - 3378.28] kind of pain it didn't matter if what
[3376.72 - 3382.56] what it looked you know like in the
[3378.28 - 3385.80] digital x-rays or the pre-digital X-ray
[3382.56 - 3388.12] era the pre-digital X-ray
[3385.80 - 3391.64] where is just like
[3388.12 - 3394.40] radiation supersonic amounts of
[3391.64 - 3396.24] radiation not just like the digital
[3394.40 - 3398.76] where it was a little bit more it was
[3396.24 - 3399.64] it's a little bit more pinpointed and a
[3398.76 - 3401.16] little
[3399.64 - 3404.04] less
[3401.16 - 3407.40] radiation but either way what would
[3404.04 - 3411.16] happen is if you had pain and even
[3407.40 - 3416.56] though the teeth checked out okay they
[3411.16 - 3418.52] drilled them and the 80s the 19s 90s and
[3416.56 - 3421.68] the first decade of the
[3418.52 - 3424.36] 2000s people they just were literally
[3421.68 - 3427.24] drilled drilled drilled to
[3424.36 - 3429.20] death it's not happening as much because
[3427.24 - 3433.48] right now dentists are actually
[3429.20 - 3435.04] understanding that wait a minute and you
[3433.48 - 3436.84] know they're like wait a minute
[3435.04 - 3440.00] something else is happening
[3436.84 - 3443.64] here but so these nerves get highly
[3440.00 - 3443.64] inflamed they get inflamed
[3443.80 - 3447.24] easy
[3445.96 - 3449.16] by the way subscribe to the medical
[3447.24 - 3452.56] medium podcast at Apple
[3449.16 - 3455.52] podcast or on Spotify there will be a
[3452.56 - 3457.68] new episode every single week big
[3455.52 - 3460.48] announcement coming next week I just
[3457.68 - 3461.88] want to give everybody for warning make
[3460.48 - 3464.84] sure you are on the medical medium
[3461.88 - 3468.48] newsletter please to be the first to
[3464.84 - 3471.44] know follow medical medium on telegram
[3468.48 - 3475.52] for exclusive audio messages but I'm
[3471.44 - 3477.80] making a big announcement next week and
[3475.52 - 3479.80] I don't know you might be interested
[3477.80 - 3481.80] okay but you got to be on the medical
[3479.80 - 3484.60] meme newsletter to get the announcement
[3481.80 - 3486.40] because I'm going to be announcing it on
[3484.60 - 3488.32] the medical mem newsletter if that makes
[3486.40 - 3489.20] any sense because that's what I'm going
[3488.32 - 3491.40] to be
[3489.20 - 3494.88] doing all
[3491.40 - 3498.44] right trino neural just really annoying
[3494.88 - 3500.48] shingles fires many many times probably
[3498.44 - 3503.36] the
[3500.48 - 3505.76] majority and then the herpes simplex one
[3503.36 - 3508.12] a big one there too
[3505.76 - 3510.84] some people can have both they could
[3508.12 - 3514.48] they could have the herpes virus simplex
[3510.84 - 3517.44] one and shingles inflaming their jaws or
[3514.48 - 3520.28] their nerves but trial trigeminal nerves
[3517.44 - 3521.76] aren't just in the jaw cranial nerves
[3520.28 - 3524.44] and they can be inflamed all the way to
[3521.76 - 3528.92] the brain stem and it can be brutal
[3524.44 - 3532.20] giving people pain that is beyond
[3528.92 - 3532.20] pain like
[3532.24 - 3538.40] just terrifying pain and and so with
[3535.60 - 3540.48] that we want to heal and people do heal
[3538.40 - 3542.16] they rid their trigeminal neurologia
[3540.48 - 3544.88] when they do medical mum information
[3542.16 - 3546.12] they learn it they learn how to heal and
[3544.88 - 3549.08] they do the
[3546.12 - 3551.00] information if I had it I would be
[3549.08 - 3554.68] killing off the viruses with medical be
[3551.00 - 3556.92] protocol I would be getting the metals
[3554.68 - 3559.36] out so they're not being fed because a
[3556.92 - 3562.68] lot of times herpes simplex one and the
[3559.36 - 3565.04] shingles will feed off of those
[3562.68 - 3566.08] Metals so let's talk about Auto immune
[3565.04 - 3568.60] for a little
[3566.08 - 3570.24] bit so what you're going to hear out
[3568.60 - 3572.00] there is so many people being diagnosed
[3570.24 - 3573.80] of autoimmune you probably already had
[3572.00 - 3575.76] an autoimmune
[3573.80 - 3578.88] diagnosis
[3575.76 - 3581.88] and pretty much everybody's going to be
[3578.88 - 3585.00] handed some form of autoimmune diagnosis
[3581.88 - 3589.60] in the coming years we're at a place now
[3585.00 - 3592.24] where everybody is getting sick even
[3589.60 - 3595.20] when they look fine they seem fine five
[3592.24 - 3598.16] years from now they're sick it's there's
[3595.20 - 3599.92] not going to be a person left on this
[3598.16 - 3603.28] planet that is in struggling with a
[3599.92 - 3607.04] symptom at some point so autoimmune is
[3603.28 - 3609.20] going to be the big overhanging umbrella
[3607.04 - 3610.40] and I talk about that in the books so
[3609.20 - 3612.40] the first thing I just want to tell you
[3610.40 - 3614.44] about autoimmune is it's not your body's
[3612.40 - 3615.88] immune system attacking itself so it's
[3614.44 - 3617.84] not your body's immune system going
[3615.88 - 3620.68] after your organs and glands so if you
[3617.84 - 3621.88] get Hashimoto thyroiditis you get a
[3620.68 - 3624.84] thyroid
[3621.88 - 3628.16] condition and they say it's autoimmune
[3624.84 - 3629.80] it's not your body attacking the thyroid
[3628.16 - 3632.72] keep that in mind because it doesn't
[3629.80 - 3635.40] help your immune system when you believe
[3632.72 - 3637.80] it has turned against you so if there's
[3635.40 - 3642.36] anything I can tell you with autoimmune
[3637.80 - 3645.44] is you have to support your immune
[3642.36 - 3646.88] system subconsciously consciously from
[3645.44 - 3651.28] your
[3646.88 - 3653.68] soul with your spirit with everything
[3651.28 - 3655.96] wholeheartedly have to support your
[3653.68 - 3658.20] immune system and know that it's working
[3655.96 - 3661.00] for you and it hasn't turned against you
[3658.20 - 3664.32] and it's not giving you
[3661.00 - 3666.80] autoimmune because the system is rigged
[3664.32 - 3669.20] so that you think your immune system has
[3666.80 - 3670.80] failed you and yes you're out there
[3669.20 - 3673.16] working with somebody or a doctor or
[3670.80 - 3675.32] somebody and you're trying to get your
[3673.16 - 3677.00] immune system more balanced and you're
[3675.32 - 3678.24] doing things and you're eating better
[3677.00 - 3679.56] and you're doing keto or you're doing
[3678.24 - 3683.08] something else or whatever it is out
[3679.56 - 3685.04] there and sure but if you think in the
[3683.08 - 3687.04] back of your mind somewhere and you
[3685.04 - 3689.04] think somewhere in your Consciousness
[3687.04 - 3691.72] subconsciousness that your immune system
[3689.04 - 3694.40] is causing this and you're now just
[3691.72 - 3698.72] battling your immune
[3694.40 - 3702.40] system not a way to win the
[3698.72 - 3705.00] healing it's not the way to win over the
[3702.40 - 3709.08] Beast the system is
[3705.00 - 3711.40] actually set up so we have these pot
[3709.08 - 3713.08] holes that chip away at us and try to
[3711.40 - 3715.44] bring us down one of them is the
[3713.08 - 3717.20] autoimmune Theory telling you that your
[3715.44 - 3719.48] body is attacking itself it's faulty
[3717.20 - 3721.88] it's destroying itself and when that
[3719.48 - 3723.40] happens it does not support your immune
[3721.88 - 3725.12] system your your immune system needs to
[3723.40 - 3727.00] know you're on board because your immune
[3725.12 - 3730.64] system can
[3727.00 - 3732.76] actually understand you it knows what
[3730.64 - 3735.56] you want it works with you it's
[3732.76 - 3739.92] connected to you like none other it's
[3735.56 - 3741.44] it's a supernatural Force so your immune
[3739.92 - 3743.04] system is a
[3741.44 - 3744.92] supernatural
[3743.04 - 3748.76] force that
[3744.92 - 3751.20] can understand what you're
[3748.76 - 3754.84] thinking what you're
[3751.20 - 3754.84] saying and what you're
[3755.28 - 3759.48] hearing
[3757.04 - 3762.16] yep you always thought autoimmune made
[3759.48 - 3764.12] no sense whoa rest of Soul said I have
[3762.16 - 3767.48] learned more from you tonight than all
[3764.12 - 3771.40] my years combined in nursing I am blown
[3767.48 - 3773.84] away and I am honored truly thank you
[3771.40 - 3776.60] lant says trigeminal neuralgia you
[3773.84 - 3779.20] describe me to a te I will be getting
[3776.60 - 3783.12] your book for geminal neuralgia make
[3779.20 - 3786.28] sure you get the new edition right
[3783.12 - 3788.48] here get the brain books if you don't
[3786.28 - 3791.24] want to get them on sale at amazon.com
[3788.48 - 3794.00] us go to the library and tell that
[3791.24 - 3796.48] Library you want them if they don't
[3794.00 - 3802.32] already have
[3796.48 - 3804.84] them yep you guys it's been fun and um
[3802.32 - 3807.28] but I am making an announcement pretty
[3804.84 - 3808.96] soon probably this week but check out
[3807.28 - 3812.00] the medical beam podcast at Apple
[3808.96 - 3815.20] podcast bloodb brain
[3812.00 - 3817.36] barrier okay now you guys I'm delivering
[3815.20 - 3818.92] this information the information's from
[3817.36 - 3820.36] above that's what's in the medical
[3818.92 - 3823.40] medium
[3820.36 - 3826.60] books and you know I droke around a
[3823.40 - 3830.08] little bit and I don't
[3826.60 - 3831.60] know and um and sometimes I get serious
[3830.08 - 3832.92] right I'm serious too but I need you to
[3831.60 - 3835.12] know something
[3832.92 - 3836.40] that like
[3835.12 - 3838.92] I know that so many of you guys are
[3836.40 - 3840.32] really suffering and struggling because
[3838.92 - 3844.72] the medical meme
[3840.32 - 3847.76] Community is the PE is is the place
[3844.72 - 3851.16] where the most sick come because they've
[3847.76 - 3852.56] tried everything else out there and they
[3851.16 - 3855.84] they didn't just come into the medical
[3852.56 - 3857.92] medium community and buy a book or
[3855.84 - 3860.28] whatever and or take a book out of the
[3857.92 - 3862.52] library they didn't just come in because
[3860.28 - 3865.92] that's the first place they wanted to
[3862.52 - 3868.48] go millions of people people that have
[3865.92 - 3871.44] the books around the world they tried
[3868.48 - 3873.04] everything everything and they exhausted
[3871.44 - 3876.00] themselves
[3873.04 - 3878.24] financially emotionally and physically
[3876.00 - 3879.68] and couldn't find the answers and so the
[3878.24 - 3881.64] people in this community really do
[3879.68 - 3883.92] struggle and they really do suffer and I
[3881.64 - 3886.24] don't lose sight of that even though I'm
[3883.92 - 3889.04] sitting here reading or talking to you
