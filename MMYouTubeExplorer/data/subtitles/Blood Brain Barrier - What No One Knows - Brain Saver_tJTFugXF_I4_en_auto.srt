so I just want to give everybody a

28
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,799
forewarning on that now I also want to

29
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,240
give you one other four warning right

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,439
here

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,200
is that if you do partake in the brain

32
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,979
shot therapy brain shot therapy cleanses

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,159
in the brain saver books be prepared to

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,320
be taken off guard what I mean by that

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,640
it's going to catch you off guard

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,560
because

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,360
you don't get instant relief and

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,640
alternative medicine and brain saver

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,820
books you're getting instant relief from

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,400
this tool which is really incredible

41
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,079
it's an entirely different experience

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,060
and the medical medium books gives

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,500
relief to people in so many ways like

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,979
there is instant relief in the medical

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,720
medium books like the shock Therapies

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,780
incident relief for so many people with

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,820
the shock therapies right and

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,200
but when you see in the brain saver

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,360
books you're going to see additional

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,939
shock therapies that give powerful

51
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,939
relief so what is this brain shot I just

52
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,939
saw a question what is this brain shot

53
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,579
well in the medical medium books

54
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,239
there is something called brain shot

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:14,040
therapy and brain shot therapy cleanses

56
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,860
now these are incredible powerful

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,900
tools for healing okay so I'm just gonna

58
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,520

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,620

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,900
you're such a genius Michael thank you

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,720

everything's for free for medical media

102
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,159
Michael so I'm not trying to be snarky

103
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,860
or anything like that but everything is

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,080
free the books cost money to make so if

105
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,680
you want to purchase a book if you want

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:13,500
to purchase literally Bibles that are

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,260
over 600 pages each

108
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,540
and there's like a hundred recipes and

109
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,859
they're packed with healing information

110
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,479
if you want to purchase these you're

111
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,199
going to have to pay something because

112
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,240
it costs way more to print it so yeah

113
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,699
money money money that's right

114
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,680
everything's for free I don't actually

132
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:21,500

133
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,060

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,560
you're not allowed to do that did you

216
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,019
know that

217
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,760
you're not allowed to do that you get in

218
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,060
trouble you're not allowed to do that

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,820
because it's a mob out there

220
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,820
it's legit you have to have that and we

221
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,000
don't do that all right nobody knows how

222
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,519
the inner or inner workings work

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,440
it costs to print the book and the

224
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,380
publisher has to distribute them around

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,740
the world if we don't have the publisher

226
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,420
print out the book and pay we don't we

227
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,920
have to pay for the paper and print it

228
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,480
out to get it out to the world and it

229
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,519
can't get into the people's hands for

230
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,500
them to heal so there has to be a charge

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,480
for the book to some degree I can't even

232
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,339
believe I'm explaining this

233
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,560
when a guy like that says why don't you

234
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,600
have everything for free I can't even

235
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
believe I'm like even saying this right

236
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,500
now they have to say this

237
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,720
it's crazy

238
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,880
it's so you can get it into your hands

239
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,800
because someday the the internet may not

240
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,660
be there and someday things like that

241
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,080
may not be there and you need it in your

242
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,080
hands

243
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,260
and you you lose electricity then you

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
don't even have ability to find anything

245
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,279
online

246
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
that's how the world works it's

247
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,220
important to have

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,220

if it's man-made yeah then you just got

559
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,039
juice

560
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,900
yep if it's man-made if it's man-made

561
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,240
information then yeah just everybody

562
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,860
stays sick in the world and they stay

563
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,960
sick until they get so sick and then

564
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:01,200
they someday somehow find a medical

565
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,840
medium book and it all makes sense and

566
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,820
they start moving forward

567
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,960
there's a physical problem with the

568
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,480
brain

569
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,679
the brain shot therapy cleanses and the

570
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,679
brain shot therapy shots

571
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,020
are incredible

572
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,400
powerful

573
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,280
historic information because it's

574
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,120
history being made right now from above

575
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,780
to help change things

576
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,340
to help you heal it's unbelievable this

577
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,380
nerve shifter

578
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,940
to break a nervous feeling about the

579
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,039
moment you're in the future or something

580
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,840
to happen you know what I told

581
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,419
you know what I told my

582
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,419
note I told my parents

583
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,620
God bless them no one I told my parents

584
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,620
told them this the other day

585
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,860
I said Mom and Dad

586
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,900
I got this gift at age four

587
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,799
we all know

588
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,460
I pour my guts out

589
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,900
I spent the life of trying to get the

590
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,640
information out there and there's always

591
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,140
going to be somebody that's just not

592
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,780
gonna understand and they're just gonna

593
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:14,820
think it's just a regular old health

594
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,520
book of

595
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,700
a fruit or a vegetable or whoever or

596
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,700
what

597
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,400
I've come to the realization there's

598
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,659
going to be people that are going to get

599
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,280
it and there's going to people people

600
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,900
that are not going to get it I come to

601
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,940
the realization I was telling my folks

602
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,100
that there's people that are going to

603
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,600
know what's in these books

604
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,919
and they're going to understand and

605
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,419
there's people that are never going to

606
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,400
understand it and they're never even

607
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:41,220
going to get the books

608
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,679
anyway a thought is not intangible it

609
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,240
runs in electricity read the books to

610
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,299
learn how it works physically in the

611
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,980
brain it's Advanced information now

612
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,200
let's just answer a question someone was

613
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,480
asking

614
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,700
so what it is is like

615
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,440
you can have the greatest books in

616
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,620
history the greatest Health books of all

617
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,419
time which are the brain saver books

618
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,419
but you know in your heart that not

619
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,760
everybody is gonna gonna get the book

620
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,980
these brain shot therapies physically

621
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,600
give the brain what it needs so that's

622
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,039
another answer to the person's question

623
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,140
it's like what

624
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,020
how do these work it's because the brain

625
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,360
shot is designed to physically give the

626
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,779
person's brain what it needs to overcome

627
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,779
that obsessive thought to overcome that

628
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:30,000
nerve twitch to overcome that betrayal

629
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,799
and broken trust moment to overcome

630
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,260
something that they're dealing and

631
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,240
struggling with that mold exposure that

632
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,460
pharmaceutical exposure that heavy metal

633
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,400
detox that heavy metal exposure sorry

634
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,539
whatever it is they're designed to

635
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,659
actually

636
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:48,059
shift the person's gear their stabilizer

637
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:50,820
shifters and exposure shots

638
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,620
powerful Lawrence has just ordered your

let's go into some stuff we talked about

645
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,840
the by the way one last thing the brain

646
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,059
shot therapy challenge is going to be

647
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,100
next week October 17th

newsletter so you know when it's coming

what's going on so let me just say this

651
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,539
point about all this

652
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,520
thoughts are not separate from what's

653
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,340
happening in the brain physically that's

654
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,279
where everyone gets it wrong if the

655
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,799
brain doesn't have what it needs and has

656
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,840
things disrupting the neurons and it's

657
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:37,140
in the way of your thoughts

658
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,400
everything's going to get out of place

659
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,779
all right let's move on to the

660
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,539
blood-brain barrier a little bit I'm

661
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:44,820
going to put one book up here

662
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,260
we got some stuff to do let's get

663
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,779
rolling

664
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,700
so I'm in this book here

665
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,500
blood-brain barrier chapter you guys

666
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,059
with me any of you guys got the book

667
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,679
right now and you can open it up and

668
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:57,059
just go into the blood brain barrier

669
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,279
chapter have you even looked at that yet

670
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:05,400
because whoa and each each page is

671
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:10,460
packed just insane blood brain barrier

672
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,460
page 184 in brain saver

673
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:15,240
our human body is not geared for the

674
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,860
levels of exposure we experience on this

675
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,559
planet that's something that you have to

676
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,679
digest and let it resonate our human

677
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,260
bodies your human body all of our human

678
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,179
bodies were never Geared for the level

679
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,440
of exposure that's here on this planet

680
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:32,360
right now

681
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,360
the blood-brain barrier

682
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,620
the blood-brain barrier never

683
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,700
anticipated the Industrial Revolution

684
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:43,500
and the classified medical industry

685
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,600
pathogen Revolution

686
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,520
our blood-brain barrier because I've

687
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,200
heard people say oh nothing gets through

688
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,220
the blood-brain barrier it's like oh

689
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,020
really

690
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,520
everything gets through the blood brain

691
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,360
barrier sadly enough

692
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,360
almost everything

693
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,179
so the our blood brain barriers never

694
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:05,700
anticipated the Industrial Revolution

695
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:07,740
were up against or the classified

696
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,720
medical industry pathogen Revolution

697
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,840
were up against our blood-brain barrier

698
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,600
had no idea that was coming ever

699
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,880
the human blood-brain barrier

700
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,799
convincing us that we're equipped to

701
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,600
handle any toxins that come our way is

702
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:25,580
like convincing us that our human body

703
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,580
is equipped to handle nuclear waste

704
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:33,840
that's just mind-blowing to me

705
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,900
we created on the planet so we should be

706
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,940
fine hey we created nuclear waste on the

707
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,740
planet so we should be fine our

708
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,539
blood-brain barrier will handle nuclear

709
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,679
waste no problem because it was created

710
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,539
on the planet

711
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,240
sure blood brain barrier can handle

712
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,340
everything it will be good

713
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,020
everything bad that's created on this

714
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:55,159
planet will be fine because it was

715
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,159
created on this planet

716
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,880
our blood-brain barrier should have no

717
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,860
problem protecting us against nuclear

718
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,860
waste or any other toxic material right

719
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,740
or blood-brain barrier is incredible it

720
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:13,100
could stop anything it could stop

721
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,100
anything

722
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,159

the levels of toxins are in our

731
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
environment in relation to how our

732
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,659
bodies handle and receive them no one's

733
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,539
measuring toxins are in our environment

734
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:47,640
you could be driving down the road and

735
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:50,399
there could be a town or city truck

736
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,919
spraying

737
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,500
some dangerous herbicides like they do

738
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,179
on the side of the roads and you can

739
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,399

passenger seat with your window down and

741
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,399
literally just take it all in that

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,080
herbicide right when you're driving down

743
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,240
the road no one's measuring anything

744
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,460
anywhere

745
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,279
mosquito sprays being dropped all over

746
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,799
this planet on Everybody by helicopters

747
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,020
no one's measuring that

748
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,840
Kaelyn says can we do brain shots on the

749
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,120
369s yes you can you can bring in the

750
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,740
brain shots while you're doing the 369s

751
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,899
you don't have to stop your medical

752
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,480
medium protocols to do the brain shots

753
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:29,159
really good question Caitlin thank you

754
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,059
for that because I forgot to tell

755
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,159
everybody that my bad my bad my bad my

756
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:37,679
bad

757
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,360
you can keep your 28 day cleanses you

758
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,799
can keep which is medical medium you can

759
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,080
keep your medical medium heavy metal

760
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,480
detoxes you can keep whatever you want

761
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,940
you can keep your medical medium three

762
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,899
six nines advanced

763
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,000
you can keep your medical medium

764
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:56,340
right all your medical medium your

765
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,380
monocleanse your morning cleanse

766
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,600
you can keep those too you can be on a

767
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,500
medical media monocleanse

768
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:08,120
and still do your shots

769
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,120
I'm a brain shot therapy

770
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,080
medical Industries don't want to admit

771
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,179
there are toxic heavy metals in our

772
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,559
brain did you know that they don't the

773
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,000
industries don't want you to know you've

774
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,279
got toxic heavy metals in the brain they

775
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,140
don't even want to entertain the idea

776
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
never mind that we're living with

777
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,059
inflammation in our brain from pathogens

778
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,260
everybody is publicly known medical

779
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,399
research and sense so what you're going

780
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,720
to learn something in the medical mean

781
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,600
books that's going to be mind-blowing

782
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,159
this alone in the mm books the brain

783
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,159
saver books is going to blow your mind

784
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,659
there's something called publicly known

785
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,279
medical research in science and the

786
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:49,380
classified medical research and science

787
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,000
these are the only books out here in

788
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,740
history that are actually distinguished

789
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,720
distinguishing distinguishing

790
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,460
distinguishing that's it the difference

791
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,899
not a lot of words going through my

792
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,679
brain right now to get this out to you

793
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,299
guys

794
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,480
so you need to know that there actually

795
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:06,779
is a difference there's two systems

796
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,720
built these books describe and detail

797
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:13,500
what that all is

798
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,260
which is incredible all on its own

799
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,399
hell yeah on day nine good cool you're

800
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,399
on day nine absolutely

801
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,120
so check this out

802
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,340
these books are the only books in

803
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,320
history so far out there that are going

804
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,580
to talk to you about the truth and tell

805
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,140
you about the classified medical

806
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,200
research and Science and the publicly

807
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,779
known uh medical research and science

808
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,360
and what the differences are

809
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,720
by the way brain shots are in day

810
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,100
brain shots can be yes used on day nine

811
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,100
of the 369 that's okay

812
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,080
I'm hearing information from SOC I'm

813
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,899
trying to read the books I'm trying to

814
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,419
I'm trying to answer questions

815
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:59,039
I'm getting readings from Spirit of

816
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,360
compassion on a bunch of you guys

817
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,159
because it happens automatically and

818
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,080
there's nothing I can do about it

819
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,820
at the same time getting information

820
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,440
from Spirit of compassion at the same

821
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,700
time trying to read the book at the same

822
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,700
time trying to express everything

823
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,080
I might bring some

824
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,419
balls out and I could juggle them too

825
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,840
maybe while we're doing all that I could

826
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,840
try that

827
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,620
I do had a shovel

828
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,919
had no time to practice

829
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,539
medical Industries don't want us to

830
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:32,039
admit there's toxic heavy metals in our

831
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,779
brain they don't even want to entertain

832
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,240
the idea never mind that we're living

833
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:38,399
with inflammation publicly known medical

834
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,740
research in science are in the infancy

835
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:44,519
stages of recognizing a chronic illness

836
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,559
dude dude

837
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,840
publicly known medical research and

838
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,240
science are at their baby stages just

839
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,980
recognizing chronic illness could be

840
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,559
pathogen related

841
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,059
if they're that early in the process of

842
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,740
understanding chronic illness how

843
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,779
advanced can they be in understanding

844
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,880
our body's complex mechanisms like the

845
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:05,220
blood-brain barrier you mean to tell me

846
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,019
it was just a couple of years ago before

847
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,720
medical research and science started

848
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:11,339
adopting medical medium information

849
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,960
about pathogens and all that it was just

850
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:15,540
a couple of years ago they don't even

851
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,879
know how the blood-brain barrier works

852
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,560
a lot of you have questions about timing

853
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,260
of brain shots the questions are

854
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,179
answered in the brain saver books so you

855
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,879
guys if you have timing questions all

856
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,399
about the brain shot Therapies

857
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,419
they're in the books the information's

858
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,700
in there

859
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:34,740
totally I didn't leave that out I made

860
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,399
sure that these books were jacked up

861
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,399
with that information

862
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,020
our blood-brain barrier was not made for

863
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,119
any of this we act like it's an

864
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,419
impermanable structure that has no

865
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,940
limitations what you'll find in

866
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:53,760
alternative medicine if anybody even

867
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,599
utters or spits out the word blood brain

868
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,420
barrier it's as if it's an impermanable

869
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,900
force on its own and nothing can pass

870
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,900
through it

871
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
we act like it's an impermanable

872
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,160
structure that has no limitations

873
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,960
nuclear waste anybody

874
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,300
Dr Sherry green unfortunately Medical

875
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,359
Science has messed up in many ways that

876
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,160
comes out every day now absolutely not

877
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:21,480
only that here's how it works and I talk

878
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,119
about it in the brain saver books you

879
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,920
get sick okay here's what it is

880
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,460
you're born

881
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,400
you're here you're a baby

882
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,619
you grow up

883
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,200
and you're taught that

884
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,900
science has it all sewed up you go to

885
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,060
school science knows everything you go

886
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,060
to university science knows everything

887
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,800
and then someday you get sick

888
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,540
and then you think science knows

889
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,980
everything I'll be fixed tomorrow I'm

890
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,619
sick now with all these crazy symptoms

891
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,060
I'm just gonna go to a doctor my mom and

892
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,800
dad are going to take me to a doctor and

893
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,960
I'll be all fixed tomorrow and then

894
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,560
you'll realize uh what

895
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
uh autoimmune uh what this that I'm not

896
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,700
being fixed what pills do you want me to

897
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,900
take Mom Dad what did the doctor say so

898
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,220
then you're coming out you're like a

899
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,540
college student now you're learning if

900
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,240
you're sick as a college student you're

901
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,520
learning uh I thought science knew

902
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,980
everything and then you go into your 20s

903
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,720
and you're like I'm so sick I can't work

904
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,940
now or I can't function and then you

905
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,859
learn that science let you down and now

906
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,440
you're like 27 years old and you're sick

907
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:29,940
and you're like what was I sold all

908
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,980
these years that science and research

909
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,800
knew everything I've been to 20 doctors

910
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm 27 years old I've taken 20

911
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,280
medications I've been to 20 functional

912
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,660
medicine doctors

913
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,660
and I'm still sick

914
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,940
everybody thinks just Industrial Waste

915
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,500
and solvents and toxic heavy metals

916
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,660
don't exist in our body but they cross

917
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,520
the blood-brain barrier I learned that

918
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,060
nothing could cross the blood-brain

919
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,260
barrier either in school health with Liz

920
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,900
oh my God

921
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,180
it's in Oh My God moment like oh my God

922
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,740
exactly

923
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,660
you know this is a moment where like

924
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,339
this bumblebees lying around and it's

925
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,020
alone and it finds another bumblebee

926
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,820
that and it's like another bumblebee

927
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,760
right butterflies flying around and

928
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,460
butterfly finds another butterfly

929
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,900
we always get all the validation from

930
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,760
you

931
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,760
Health with Liz I just want to say this

932
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,040
okay that wait uh

933
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,140
Amanda says this means we don't need to

934
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,119
blame ourselves for our own depression

935
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,619
or anxiety that's the whole point too

936
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,720
because everybody's blamed on it

937
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:35,820
everybody's blamed on it health local is

938
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,440
you're right you were taught that

939
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,520
nothing can get through the blood-brain

940
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,260
barrier

941
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,820
everybody's taught right that nothing

942
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,040
gets through the blood brain barrier but

943
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,839
they're wrong

944
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,339
I talk about what gets through the

945
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,540
blood-brain barrier these books are

946
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:51,420
incredible

947
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:55,020
wondering Wishin says the dream shot

948
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,420
tastes amazing the dream shot which I

949
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,700
personally love

950
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,859
I take the dream shot

951
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,260
I take the dream shot before I go to bed

952
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,119
I take the dream shot a little bit

953
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,500
earlier than that too I take it twice

954
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,240
actually so a lot of times I'll take a

955
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,160
dream shot at like

956
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,960
10 o'clock at night then I'll take the

957
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,700
dream shot like two in the morning

958
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,160
before I go to bed

959
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,160
why am I up till two I'm working

960
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,920
wake up at six then I get my four hours

961
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,099
of sleep depending that's a good day

962
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,099
foreign

963
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,980
all right

964
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,619
enough about me it's not the Anthony

965
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,359
Williams Show it never was

966
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:38,520
about answers and about our suffering

967
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,440
all someone has to do is use the term

968
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,579
blood-brain barrier to make us feel like

969
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,200
we're protected it's like you're

970
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,119
protected you've got your blood brain

971
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,640
barrier

972
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,160
and yet the reality is that all these

973
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,380
and more inevitably cross meaning toxins

974
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,660
you guys cross our blood-brain barrier

975
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,400
many Pharmaceuticals are specifically

976
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,260
engineered to cross our blood-brain

977
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,880
barrier even the Pharmaceuticals show

978
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,619
this is mind-blowing right here nobody

979
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,260
knows any of this it doesn't matter what

980
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,079
podcast doctor talks or whoever no one

981
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,260
knows any of this look at this even the

982
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,119
Pharmaceuticals not designed

983
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,339
with it in mind to cross your

984
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,200
blood-brain barrier

985
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,940

987
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,000
Pharmaceuticals and they're not designed

988
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,060
across the blood-brain barrier but they

989
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,220

incredible is that okay how about this

1115
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,740

shot can help you heal through your

1123
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,880
dream process in this short amount of

1124
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,680
sleep you're getting if you're somebody

1125
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,420
that's not sleeping good you can't sleep

1126
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,099
good and you're only sleeping for a

1127
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,319
short amount of time that's when the

1128
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:56,040
dream shifter shot comes in so you can

1129
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,020
get maximum maximum rest in that short

1130
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,119
window of sleep

1131
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,220
I've been using it to get by I have

1132
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,920
extremely short window of sleep because

1133
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,020
I'm working too hard and in that seven

1134
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,300
day schedule a week and working too hard

1135
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,740
I'm like doing this the dream shifter

1136
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,740
all right back the blood brand barrier

1137
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,940
my apologies

1138
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,660
our blood brain barrier was designed to

1139
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,040
keep natural Mo mostly bodily toxins out

1140
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,440
of the brain

1141
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,940
that's all it was designed for was it

1142
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,940
designed for anything else

1143
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,380
you guys 40 off on both these books take

1144
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,200
advantage of it as soon as you can

1145
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,300
amazon.com us when someone has a little

1146
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,220
too much uric acid oh get ready for this

1147
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,140
one the books are so mind-blowing it's

1148
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,819
hard to focus on just one topic I'm

1149
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,119
actually like scrambled eggs right now

1150
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:54,060
because there's so much going on

1151
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,680
you can spend a lifetime reading these

1152
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,000
books over and over again and I promise

1153
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,160
you you'll be like I never read that

1154
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,839
before this book

1155
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,119
Jen coffin said it did the energy

1156
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:06,980
shifter yesterday gave me lots of energy

1157
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,980
before going out incredible

1158
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,859
Jamie says I'm making my heavy metal

1159
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,720
detox smoothie right now and there's

1160
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:14,700
seven heavy metal detox cleanses

1161
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,140
including Advanced cleanse in the

1162
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,140
medical medium brain saver books

1163
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,940
when someone has a little too much uric

1164
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,359
acid

1165
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,619
build up because a kidney is weakened a

1166
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,839
lot of people have weakened kidneys

1167
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,880
without knowing it for instance that

1168
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:35,220
uric acid is not supposed to permeate

1169
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,800
the blood-brain barrier

1170
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,720
if someone gets a cut that goes deep and

1171
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,520
leads to a skin infection then that

1172
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,339
person could develop the beginning

1173
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,200
stages of sepsis in which case the blood

1174
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:47,819
infection is not supposed to cross the

1175
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,980
blood-brain barrier the blood-brain

1176
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:52,020
barrier is for when you get a cut and

1177
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,880
you get some kind of sepsis or infection

1178
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,740
the blood-brain barrier is when you got

1179
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,660
too much uric acid building up in your

1180
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,060
kidneys and system because you have a

1181
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,280
weak kidney the blood-brain barrier is

1182
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,500
for normal bodily toxins like normal

1183
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,900
ammonia amounts of ammonia in your body

1184
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,760
certain things that are inside the body

1185
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:10,380
the blood-brain barrier tries to stop a

1186
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,119
lot of the sin doesn't stop all of it

1187
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,859
but there's the natural stuff that

1188
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,359
occurs inside our body the blood-brain

1189
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:16,619
barrier is trying to stop but the

1190
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,280
blood-brain barrier doesn't stop

1191
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:19,280
anything else

1192
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,040
if someone ingests a toxic plant that's

1193
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,200
been on planet Earth for 10 000 years

1194
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,640
and was never meant to be human food the

1195
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,440
blood-brain barrier is there to hold

1196
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,520
back at least some of those poisons who

1197
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,220
knows that

1198
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,780
who knows that

1199
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,880

you deserve all the respect

1230
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:52,560
okay you ready okay if someone ingests

1231
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,540
the toxic plant that's been on planet

1232
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,160
Earth for ten thousand years and was

1233
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,540
never meant to be human food the

1234
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,400
blood-brain barrier is there to hold

1235
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:01,500
back at least some of the toxins in an

1236
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,140
effort to prevent the brain from going

1237
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,180
into toxic shock no one on this planet

1238
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,119
knows that

1239
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:12,740
and you can't make up this stuff

1240
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:16,140
can't make up almost 1300 pages of

1241
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,700
literally scripture from above

1242
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,920
that becomes Advanced Medical

1243
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,500
information that science research ends

1244
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,000
up stealing down the road and proving it

1245
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,000
right but never proving it wrong

1246
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:33,599
our blood cerebral fluid

1247
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:35,640
barrier is also over taxed cerebral

1248
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,680
spinal fluid which surrounds the brain

1249
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,900
and spinal cord is supposed to be pure

1250
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,420
with no contamination that's the gold

1251
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,160
standard that's the gold standard in

1252
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:47,220
this time on planet Earth our cerebral

1253
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,960
spinal fluid is not pure so our spinal

1254
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,140
fluid's not pure

1255
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,339
okay all of us got dirty spinal fluid if

1256
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,339
we're getting exposures

1257
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,119
okay

1258
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,940
let's keep on going a little bit more

1259
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,560
about that was pretty cool that's the

1260
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,859
gold standard and this time on planet

1261
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,859
Earth

1262
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,760
our spinal fluid is not pure it's

1263
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,099
harboring chemical soups from Industries

1264
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,280
pathogenic byproducts toxic heavy metals

1265
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:23,640
and more a thousand years ago cerebral

1266
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,619
spinal fluid May simply have had some

1267
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,900
toxic heavy metal contamination but

1268
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:29,880
that's about it for the people living in

1269
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,920
cities drinking lead water back during

1270
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,660
the Roman days

1271
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,880
spinal fluid had a whole different

1272
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:38,819
Purity hundreds of thousands of years

1273
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,619
ago today we walk around polluted I

1274
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:42,960
can't scratch how much information is in

1275
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:44,400
the blood-brain barrier chapter there's

1276
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,520
more paragraphs and more information

1277
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,960
it's just it's each line is jam-packed

1278
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,880
if you guys think this is just a

1279
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,119
blood-brain barrier book you're wrong

1280
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,839

1281

1576
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,960
be

1577
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:51,720
Rhonda

1578
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,119
I stay as neutral as I can but the

1579
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:56,160
haters are big

1580
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:57,839

01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,520
social media about me is unbelievable

1582
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,140
behind the scenes and in front of the

1583
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,020
scenes

1584
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,119

times it's sore Lynette says are you a

1588
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:14,940
Christian I'm wondering since you say

1589
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,859
the info comes from above I know you say

1590
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,200
from SOC but I struggle to understand

1591
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:22,020
this as a Christian

1592
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,200
I really do like a majority of your info

1593
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,880
and have four of your books as listen I

1594
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:30,059
will say this okay

1595
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,859
that you being here means the world to

1596
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,900
me okay because I know that some

1597
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:36,319
Christians they'll be like he's the

1598
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,319
devil

1599
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:41,760
it's like okay well

1600
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:43,140
a lifetime of work getting people out of

1601
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,819
wheelchairs

1602
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,859
saving lives

1603
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:48,240
bringing information to people so they

1604
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:51,839
can heal

1605
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:54,980
and then choose whatever religion they

1606
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,980
want to choose in their life

1607
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:01,880
it's not easy to partake in a religion

1608
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:05,460
or religious belief system or anything

1609
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:07,619
if you're so sick

1610
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,760
or not here

1611
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:13,619
my job is to make sure that everybody

1612
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,720
gets healthy

1613
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:18,599
heals

1614
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:22,020
get strong and they can believe in

1615
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:25,640
anything they want to believe in

1616
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,640
what I've always told Christians

1617
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,700
is

1618
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,460
what about profits out there

1619
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,079
Christians believe in Prophets

1620
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,640
I do know that

1621
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,200
that's something that Christians believe

1622
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,079
in

1623
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:43,619
and if you look into the medical medium

1624
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:47,059
books you'll find there is

1625
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:47,059
a message always

1626
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:52,140
from the scripture down here so you can

1627
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,319
look and find it

1628
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:57,960
I'm going to do a show

1629
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:59,640
about Christianity at some point in the

1630
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,319
medical meeting podcast I just haven't

1631
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,540
had the chance I have all eight of your

1632
01:05:01,319 --> 01:05:05,819
books I love them

1633
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:09,380
amazing

1634
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:09,380
William Miller it's Bryce

1635
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,780
Cold Light spring says it seems prophets

1636
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,579
only existed in biblical times

1637
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:20,040
but I can't see the rest of the comment

1638
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:22,980
oh there it is which is kind of weird

1639
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:25,440
Trisha Marie with a Christian background

1640
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:28,400
all of this makes complete and perfect

1641
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,400
sense to me

1642
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,720
I think a lot of Christians use medical

1643
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:35,339
meme information

1644
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:37,140
I really do

1645
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:39,540
I know there's some that just they can't

1646
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,520
get around they can't get around it and

1647
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:43,079
they're like I just can't look at those

1648
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,940
books or something and I still have

1649
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,180
respect for everybody in them it's all

1650
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,180

Melissa Davis as a Christian I have no

1696
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:41,280
trouble believing that Spirit would

1697
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,839
choose a strong person to relay an

1698
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,539
important message

1699
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:47,220

1700
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:49,799
you that that's exactly factual

1701
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,099
everything you just said about me is

1702
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:56,700

1703
01:07:53,099 --> 01:08:01,260

1704
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:03,780

Oliver and Kate Hudson's podcast I

1706
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,960
talked about a little bit about that and

1707
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:09,480
Oliver

1708
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,400
Ollie said you know like there it is

1709
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,400
there it is that's why you were picked

1710
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,760
anyway

1711
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,699

maybe someday it'll be in a museum

1714
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:28,259
anyway you guys

1715
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,239
um the point is this I didn't want to

1716
01:08:28,259 --> 01:08:31,980
make it the Anthony Williams Show out

1717
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,779
there and I can go and do all that stuff

1718
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,460
I can fill my entire schedule I just

1719
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:37,319
want to say this I can fill my entire

1720
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:42,420
schedule

1721
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:44,640
with TV appearances podcast appearances

1722
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:48,239
TV series

1723
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:51,660
all of it I can hop on a plane and fly

1724
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:54,000
around everywhere and be in every Studio

1725
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,620
to Kingdom Come

1726
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,020
I can

1727
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,880
and I can do that for years and talk

1728
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,799
about how I hear Spirit of compassion

1729
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,839
and talk about all of that but I'm going

1730
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:05,759
to make it the Anthony Williams Show and

1731
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:08,819
then these things will never be produced

1732
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,799
ever all these things won't be produced

1733
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:13,560
they just won't be made they won't be

1734
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:15,719
produced it won't be possible it just

1735
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:18,359
won't happen

1736
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,100
it just won't happen because this is the

1737
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:22,440
scripture right here and my job is to

1738
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,359
make sure I do this and try not to do so

1739
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:26,219
many appearances anywhere once in a

1740
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,120
while I'll break and do something I'd be

1741
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:29,120
like all right I'll do it

1742
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:36,239
let's cleanse the heel by the way

1743
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:38,339
you know I look at this book and I say

1744
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,500
thank you for turning so many lives

1745
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:43,259
around healing so many people and saving

1746
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,540
so many lives thank you because you've

1747
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:48,660
saved so many lives I say that to that

1748
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:51,120
book right there and I sit at my office

1749
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,920
desk and I say thank you for saving

1750
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,920
millions of lives around the planet to

1751
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,719
you too because without you so many

1752
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,880
people would have not gotten off of

1753
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:02,400
mattress Island I say thank you thank

1754
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,820
you thank you and I do I'm grateful

1755
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,820
that's why

1756
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:10,380
and then I'll say the soc thank you to

1757
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,960
even though you've hijacked my life and

1758
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,420
made my life very hard

1759
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,179
it makes sense all of it builds up

1760
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,260
builds a pond and doesn't contradict so

1761
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:21,420
that's the whole thing all the medical

1762
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:23,100
meaning books build and build upon each

1763
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:26,340
other with the new information coming in

1764
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:28,620
but never contradict

1765
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,760
medical me I just I just want to say

1766
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:32,640
this last thing I've said it before

1767
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:35,280
ready medical medium information is not

1768
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,679
common sense

1769
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:40,380
because none of the medical medium

1770
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,420
information was ever common

1771
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:45,900
originally

1772
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,820
it was unique original and brand new and

1773
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,980
then as it got out there and the

1774
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:52,560
millions of people partooking it and and

1775
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:54,420
spread that information around much of

1776
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,880
it became common

1777
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,560
meaning like common knowledge but

1778
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,260
medical meme information just makes

1779
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,659
sense it's not common sense

1780
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,000
by the way clean your books if you guys

1781
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:09,120
want if you get a dirty book

1782
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,880
from Amazon or somewhere because their

1783
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,980
conveyor belt got greasy

1784
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,900
because their conveyor belt got greasy

1785
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,540
put a little dish soap

1786
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,100
damp cloth not too wet you don't want to

1787
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:22,980
soak your book because then you're gonna

1788
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:25,320
have a wet book and you clean off your

1789
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:29,100
covers you they're all brand new when

1790
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:31,860
they leave the publishers

1791
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:34,739
right the printer and they leave the

1792
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,780
publisher they're pristine

1793
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:39,659
no odor

1794
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:42,000
no air fresheners no scented candles no

1795
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:44,940
perfumes no colognes no no whatever

1796
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,760
they're pristine and what happens is

1797
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:49,739
they go into like the Amazon places and

1798
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,900
what happens is the conveyor belts are

1799
01:11:49,739 --> 01:11:53,400
greasy they're all filled with grease

1800
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,780
because they have to grease The Wheels

1801
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,340
on the conveyors

1802
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,140
and then

1803
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:59,460
the books get thrown on the conveyor

1804
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,659
belt and you might get some grease you

1805
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,640
have to clean it off they'll come out

1806
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:05,520
beautiful you guys leave some reviews if

1807
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,040
you can I hate asking for reviews

1808
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,860
but it keeps the trolls like from

1809
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:12,540
getting ahead ones that did not purchase

1810
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,239
the books the ones that never read the

1811
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:17,760
books the ones that just don't like

1812
01:12:15,239 --> 01:12:19,500
medical medium because they don't like

1813
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,480
my face they don't like my voice they

1814
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,820
don't like what I'm doing whatever and

1815
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,380
look out for imposters yeah if you can

1816
