asleep

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,939

12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,619
so I hope you guys stick around for that

13
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,660
because it's really cool I haven't

14
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,600

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm trying my best I'm only human I'm

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,460
trying my best SOC gives me information

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,620
I put it in everywhere put it here there

18
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,899
write the podcast all that stuff I

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,760
publish it and there's so much and

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,760
there's things that I do for myself that

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,280
I've gotten into a routine doing that I

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,719
just kind of even forget to like teach

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,460
it out there because there's so many

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,079
other things I'm doing but I want to

25
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,260
show you this really cool technique that

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,300
I do every single night for my immune

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,760
system and so there's a spiritual

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,979
connection involved in my nighttime

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,020
routine that I want to tell you about

30
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,340
which is really cool so anyway I'm just

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,840
going to start right now with the subs

because this stuff is that incredible

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,040
and I want it to stick around so people

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,780
have the opportunity to actually have

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,400
this in their lives and I'm going to

come back from the hospital just now

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,820
that's not what this is this is my

55
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,380
pajamas so I didn't just come back from

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,979
the hospital right where's my hospital

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,319
tag so anyway no these are my pajamas

58
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,800
man so let's get started with this this

59
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,780
immune system that's what I'm talking

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,080
about right now and that's what's

61
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,239
connected spiritually to my nighttime

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,040
routine so I want to go into that a

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,420
little bit so let me just start right so

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,879
there's some cats call I'm going to pop

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,220
some in this little shot glass right so

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,099
here it is right nighttime routine

67
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,099
putting some cat's claw in cat's claw

68
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,140
right supports the immune system I'm

69
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:39,000
gonna put some propolis in here too

70
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,739
which is cool about Provost I like also

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,620
just putting it straight in the mouth

72
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,140
it's good for oral health which is

73
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,060
amazing about propolis too right and

74
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,940
supports the immune system

75
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,640
here's the zinc

76
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,800
right thing is with zinc and I've said

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,720
this over and over again I've said this

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,879
over and over again about the zinc okay

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,599
going all the way back

80
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,680
it's great for every aspect of our body

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:11,700
zinc is one of those essential minerals

82
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,280
that our entire body needs right one of

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,319
the essential minerals for health so

84
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,800
I've been saying that about saying man

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,739
going all the way back so right here

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,879
it's immune system right zinc propolis

87
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,440
cat's claw okay nettle leaf now nettle

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,599
Leaf is great for a lot of things like

89
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,220
urinary supports urinary tract but I

90
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,319
like it for immune system

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,239
so that's important right there

92
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,580
I got the nettle Leaf going right there

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,019
okay so that's an immune system shot

94
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,019
right there let me get a little bit of

95
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,140
water so I want to take this shot it's

96
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:50,480
part of my nighttime routine right here

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,480
so I'm gonna shoot this down now

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,120
here's how it goes

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,440
now I'm going to have dinner and stuff

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,420
I'll make some Dory rolls but I'm just

101
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,739
kind of like jostling things around a

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,580
little bit in my routine but I want to

103
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,340
tell you

104
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,540
what happens is has that entered my body

105
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,940
right now

106
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm connecting to it it's really

107
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:15,540
important so I'll tell you what happens

108
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,859
the minute that goes down and into me

109
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,540
right

110
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:21,540
I can feel it

111
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,900
because I like being in tuned

112
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,740
to the supplementation that I'm taking

113
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,759
that my body's receiving so I like to be

114
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,199
so in tuned that I like to Envision my

115
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,840
immune cells

116
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,759
right away when that stuff is going in

117
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,820
me because that's important right there

118
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,400
so my immune system right

119
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,940
so right when I take

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,720
that shot and I sent that down

121
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:55,380
I align it instantly to visualizing my

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,419
immune cells my white blood cells that's

123
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,520
important and then

124
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,259
I go about my business for the rest of

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,060
the night a little bit right winding

126
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,300
down I'm making my meal getting myself

127
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,560
ready but when I go to bed

128
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,320
when I go to bed and I hop in bed

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,440
right put the blanket over me

130
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,940
and I close my eyes I shut the light off

131
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,040
and close my eyes

132
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,840
I envision

133
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,699
a white blood cell

134
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,699
and I Envision that white blood cell

135
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,840
floating around

136
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,100
so this is the visualization I do right

137
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,880
so I'm seeing that white blood cell

138
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:42,600
floating around while I'm actually

139
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,820
getting ready to fall asleep

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
and I'm envisioning it right

141
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,820
and this is what I do every night for

142
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,400
years that's my immune system right

143
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,720
there now then

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,580
I connect to the immune

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,919
support

146
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,380
that I took

147
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,860
I connect to the propolis

148
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,240
I connect to the cat's claw I connect to

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,000
the zinc

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,479
I connect to the nettle leaf

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,840
right and I'm connecting to it and then

152
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:22,020
I'm seeing my white blood cells receive

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,960
that Incredible Gift

154
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,360
that incredible power

155
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,340
it's just

156
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,380
consuming it and I visualize this now

157
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,220
here's the incredible thing too and then

158
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,160
I visualize my white blood cells with my

159
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,520
eyes closed falling asleep with the

160
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,819
light off I envisualize right

161
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,900
I see the white blood cells gobbling up

162
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,020
toxins

163
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,600
gobbling up poisons and toxins that's

164
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,199
what I see I see it start to gobble up

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,860
those poisons and those toxins right

166
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:03,180
and that's what I do and I lay there and

167
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,740
I connect to my body and I connect to

168
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,740
the purity

169
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,039
of what I took

170
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,840
because I don't have to worry too about

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,220
stuff being in these supplements which

172
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm going to talk about stuff that

173
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,000
shouldn't be there so I don't have to

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
worry about that and I'm going to talk

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,020
about that in a second as well but this

176
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,599
visualization

177
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,400
and connects to the affirmations I also

178
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,979
say for myself like

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,780
my white blood cells I see them

180
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:36,360
I can see them floating across my vision

181
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,479
my eyes closed and I can see those white

182
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:43,979
blood cells gobbling things up that

183
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:46,500
should not be inside my body toxins and

184
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,360
poisons because we're exposed to so many

185
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,060
toxins and poisons out there so I'm

186
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,419
watching my white blood cells eat that

187
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,220
up as I'm falling asleep right and then

188
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,860
I talk to him I talk to my immune system

189
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,479
I talk to my immune cells and I tell my

190
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,180
white blood cells

191
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,720
that they're doing an amazing job and I

192
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,840
say in an affirmation way I go

193
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,900

nothing gets in your way you can you can

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,979
gobble up digest and eat up

201
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:37,800
and completely destroy toxins and

202
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,899
poisons and I know you're doing that and

203
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,779
I do the affirmations with my immune

204
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,399
system which is really powerful and the

205
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,140
affirmations with the immune system is

206
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,399
really powerful

207
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,480
watching those immune cells across my

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,220
eyes

209
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,500
gobbling up

210
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,120
all the different toxins and poisons and

211
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,580
I talked to my immune cells and I see

212
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,180
did I feed you guys

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,160
right and then I Envision that my immune

214
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,040
system can speak

215
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,360
and they're saying yes you gave us what

216
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,360
we needed

217
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,440
which is really powerful really powerful

218
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,300
right there so what I do is I the Lee my

219
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,300
nighttime routine changes

220
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,700
it shifts right now this is it for now

221
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,740
but then it shifts different

222
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,560
supplementation different times

223
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,480
different seasons different stress in my

224
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,100

00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,720
of stress I work 22 hour days 20 hour

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,680
days 18 hour days

229
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,899
I worked 24-hour days sometimes which is

230
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,060
not really a great idea either but I do

231
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,040
it I got deadlines I got

232
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,860
responsibilities there are lots of

233
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,300
people relying on me so what what I do

234
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,899
because someone might say oh you do a

235
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:01,019
lot for your nighttime routine yeah and

236
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:03,779
I have tremendous responsibility I have

237
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,459
people relying on me I got the world

238
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,240
relying on me for getting the

239
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:11,160
information from SOC out to everybody so

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,839
that information's there and that's

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,760
always a fight and a struggle to get

242
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,740
that out there in the world because the

243
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,240
world it's how it is it's hard to get

244
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,240
information out there right it's a lot

245
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,980
of work and so all of that there's a lot

246
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,440
of responsibilities plus personal life

247
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,380
stuff right that everybody has

248
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
and so with that it changes and it Ebbs

249
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,820
and flows

250
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,019
but right now what I'm doing supporting

251
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,760
my immune system is one of the things

252
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,200
I'm doing right what I love about the

253
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,860
propolis

254
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,560
the energy propolis right is it has up

255
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,380
to over 50 percent

256
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,200
of the polyphenols right

257
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,519
after polyphenols are in the propolis

258
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
which is incredible one of them is

259
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,140
quercetin so that's actually an

260
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,660
acropolis which I really love right

261
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,600
Central it's essential in my opinion

262
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:03,540
right I take it for antioxidant support

263
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,600
I take it for my immune system and

264
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,579
here's what's cool no propylene glycol

265
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,019
in here and that's going to lead me to

266
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,839
something I want to tell you guys which

267
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:17,180
is really incredible but no propylene

268
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:20,160
glycol in here and they do a specialized

269
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,740
specialized process which is amazing a

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
pic like which is incredible what they

271
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,240
do as far as the pro unique

272
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,459
um unique purification process which

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,860
doesn't exist anywhere else from what

274
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,320
I've heard so it's really amazing their

275
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,500
stuff so I want to talk about

276
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,140
some cool things with this now four

277
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,720
reasons why support

278
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,519
the vimergy company right and four

279
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
reasons why I fully endorsed them and

280
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,560
working with them I got to tell you

281
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,060
one is and you be the judge to this

282
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,500
okay right one is

283
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,640
label requirements

284
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,680
just so you know label requirements for

285
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,920
supplement companies

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,640
does not require the supplement company

287
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,420
right to list or disclose

288
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,700
all the ingredients inside the bottle

289
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,680
I'll repeat myself right there

290
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,839
label requirements right for supplement

291
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,660
companies don't require

292
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,399
all the ingredients in the product to be

293
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,019
disclosed

294
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,720
just so you know

295
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,160
keep it in mind they can have a small

296
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,860
percentage

297
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,279
of ingredients in this supplementation

298
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,860
out there that they don't disclose

299
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,459
that you don't know about like flow

300
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,000
agents things like flow agents

301
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,980
exactly and other ingredients Bemidji

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,980
they vowed

303
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,500
okay they would never do that they would

304
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,079
never put

305
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,240
undisclosed hidden ingredients are

306
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:02,100
hidden flow agents or anything like that

307
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,139
in their products that alone right there

308
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,120
because I've never seen that anywhere

309
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,279
else in my opinion when my in my life

310
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,540
I've never seen it that right there is

311
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:16,380
like drop the mic it's drop the mic

312
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:19,260
because I'm about connecting to the

313
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,860
stuff I consume spiritually emotionally

314
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:26,100
that's what I'm about right and so when

315
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,600
people who know me like really dear dear

316
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,220
family members or friends they know that

317
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
it's all about like that spiritual

318
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,980
connection with everything I do right so

319
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,639
it's all about the purification too okay

320
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:41,279
so when I take something for my immune

321
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,320
for immune support right when I do that

322
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,820
and I'm envisioning that white blood

323
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,120
cell

324
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,399
on connecting to the Purity factor of

325
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,260
what I put in my body too

326
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,019
I'm connecting to the fact that there's

327
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,959
no flow agents there's no hidden

328
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:00,839
ingredients that are not being disclosed

329
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,240
right and so that's what I'm connecting

330
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,860
to when I take the memory stuff so it's

331
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,040
like you know what it's high time just

332
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,079
full endorsement boom I stand behind the

333
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,019
company I want people in the world to be

334
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,380
able to have the opportunity to have the

335
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:18,120
same opportunity that I have which is

336
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,760
knowing I'm getting that pureness inside

337
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,579
my body and then connecting to that

338
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,360
pureness which is which is critical for

339
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,620
me

340
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,720
right

341
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,540
I need to know there isn't something

342
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,399
hidden there isn't something tricky

343
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,260
going on even if it's legal even it's

344
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,660
legal because label requirements they

345
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,820
legally make it so you can hide and

346
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,100
disclose you don't you can hide and not

347
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:46,440
disclose certain stuff small percentage

348
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:48,899
but vimoji goes above legal requirements

349
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,180
and they don't put anything like that in

350
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,920
there that's hidden in small percentages

351
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,899
and they always disclose everything

352
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,060
that's in there that's incredible so

353
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,639
that's one thing by the way so be the

354
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,180
judge on this next one okay

355
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,639

that's insane when I think about it

372
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,420
because

373
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,339
I've seen a lot of supplementation out

374
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,360
there in the world all right from what

375
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,079

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,060
no maltodextrin maltodextrin is almost

378
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,820
virtually almost in almost everything

379
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,279
virtually almost in everything

380
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,680
Healthcare and people don't know that no

381
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,920

382
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,139

out there in one way form or another

385
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,100
even if it says like organic natural

386
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,380
flavors or natural flavors or whatever

387
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,060
right no artificial flavors in it no

388
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,519
titanium dioxide that's the second thing

389
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,339
be the judge on that one but let me tell

390
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,040

391
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,220

maltodextrin in there and all these

406
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,679
things and then I I is a Consciousness

407
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,880
kind of level so what happens is when

408
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,900
people say what do you do in your

409
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,220
personal life well I'm doing my

410
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,100
nighttime routine I'm showing you guys

411
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,380
but I'm telling you something that I

412
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,120
don't talk to people about it's it's

413
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,980
kind of private to me in my life

414
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,380
absolutely but I wanted to tell you is

415
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,080
there's a spiritual connection I do with

416
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,020
everything in my life and there is a

417
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,360
soul connection and a Consciousness I

418
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,299
have to connect with to my soul about

419
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,980
purify application and Purity and things

420
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,320
like that and so if I'm going to put

421
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,620
something in my body in my own my own

422
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,140
body and how I feel I and recommend it

423
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,120
to a family friend or anybody

424
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,100
that's the second big thing where it's

425
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,080
like oh my God that's incredible that

426
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,700
that's not going to be in here which is

427
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,980
unbelievable now here's the third third

428
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
incredible thing right very cheap

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,580
okay our third party independently

431
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,140
tested not just

432
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,919
in-house

433
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,960
third party independently tested that's

434
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,720
the kind of Integrity that alone is

435
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,539
insane and here's the fourth right here

436
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,820
's the fourth which I find just as big

437
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,580
as the other ones right here okay about

438
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,140
the vimergy products

439
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,700
the fourth is

440
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,400
if you want to start a supplement

441
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,360
company you can choose the lower quality

442
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,460
stuff

443
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,380
for price point I don't know if you guys

444
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,960
heard of anything like this but this is

445
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,600
how it goes you can choose the lower

446
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,179
quality right you can choose the lower

447
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,440
quality cilantro product that's at the

448
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,900
bottom tier

449
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,539
or you can choose a little higher that's

450
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,039
this level product mean the quality or

451
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,720
you can choose a higher level quality

452
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,340
it's going to cost more but you can

453
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,919
choose if your supplement company the

454
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,679
another level but if you're some you can

455
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,320
even go higher and Bemidji goes

456
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,200
to the best sources to the highest

457
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,480
quality sources they can possibly find

458
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:10,260
regardless of the cost

459
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,340
they go to the top tier regardless of

460
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,380
the cost

461
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,780
if that doesn't blow my mind I don't

462
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,000
know what does or what doesn't and you

463
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,940
be the judge and jury man you be the

464
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,380
judge and jury on that so anyway

465
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,179
connecting to

466
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:29,700
my body right having that connection my

467
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,720
Consciousness my soul my spirit my

468
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,940
physical body I need to know it's pure

469
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,539
because I could feel it if I put

470
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:42,480
something that's not so pure or not pure

471
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:44,700
in my body I'll take it right off

472
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,559
I'll pick it right off

473
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,419
and that's the thing with me and that's

474
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,520
how I've always been and people wonder

475
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,740
why do you stand behind Imaging so much

476
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,539
why do you always because of that reason

477
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,580
that's one of the big reasons right

478
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,020
there outside of all of them right so

479
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,000
immune system stuff let's go a little

480
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,820
bit more into that so back to the immune

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,740
system so what I do is I take vitamin C

482
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,200
closer to bed is what I do right so I

483
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,679
take a little bit of vitamin C

484
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,000
okay that's the micro C right there okay

485
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,919
if you guys just came on here I'm

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
talking about how I support Bemidji

487
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,100
fully endorse them working with them and

488
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,960
I'm talking about like the wise too

489
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,000
about what that connection is like why

490
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,160
why would I

491
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,299
because when I think about that

492
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,179
connection spiritually and everything

493
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:31,799
about it so when I do the visualization

494
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,280
technique

495
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,780
with my white blood cells at night and

496
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm falling asleep and the lights are

497
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,919
out and I'm seeing

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,140
my white blood cells now if you're

499
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,880
somebody that has floaters in your eyes

500
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,799
right you've got floaters you got you

501
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
got spots and when you close your eyes

502
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,980
or even when they're open and you see

503
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,140
them right but you close your eyes

504
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,960
because the doctor friend was telling me

505
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,640
how he has these white spots that float

506
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,679
around when he closes his eyes right eye

507
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,299
floaters right so he was asking me

508
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,640
questions about that a doctor friend of

509
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:04,679
mine and I said if you have those for

510
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,960
now before you can work on getting

511
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,520
Rhythm if you have those for now when

512
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,660
you're going to bed and you shut your

513
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
eyes he goes well that's when I see him

514
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,419
I go to bed at night I shut my eyes and

515
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,280
the eye floaters are all swimming around

516
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,260
I said Envision that they're not eye

517
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,760
floaters Envision that they're your

518
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,679
white blood cells

519
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,260
that's your that's your white blood

520
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,360
cells Envision that see those little

521
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,100
floaters as your white blood cells

522
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,900
that's them right there your immune

523
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,940
cells all floating around since that's

524
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,039
incredible he said that's incredible and

525
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,440
he's doing it he's doing he says it's a

526
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,380
life changer game changer for him right

527
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,299
so I love this technique of seeing the

528
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,520
white blood cell and then I think about

529
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:45,120
the vitamin C

530
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:49,380
vitamin C supports a healthy immune

531
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,799
system vitamin C right it's hot it's

532
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,780
high in antioxidants right vitamin C

533
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,860
okay

534
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,780
right supports the skin it supports the

535
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,559
skin so you have to think about that

536
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,500
right

537
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:07,559
so if micro C is supporting the skin

538
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,120
it's supporting right your immune your

539
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,380
immune system healthy immune system

540
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,880
supports healthy immune system when

541
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,280
you're thinking about you're thinking of

542
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,159
white blood cell the white count

543
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,659
in that Vision spiritually when you're

544
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,440
falling asleep

545
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,500
and I fall asleep to my immune cells

546
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,419
receiving that vitamin C

547
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,840
gaining strength in my mind

548
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:33,419
Consciousness in my visual and

549
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,000
affirmation abilities just like you have

550
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,039
those and I see it gobbling up that

551
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,400
vitamin C and then I see those white

552
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:44,340
blood cells gobbling up anything that I

553
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,600
want them to gobble up anything that I'm

554
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,280
thinking about well I had a little

555
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,020
exposure got into some different toxins

556
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,659
then I'm seeing my white blood cells go

557
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,419
and grab those toxins and Gobble those

558
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,200
toxins up and that's what I do right

559
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,900
there

560
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,020
and that's a really big one for me of

561
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,179
what I do every day okay so

562
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,299
um I I there's so many reasons why I

563
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,900
love Energy Products just hear me out if

564
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,120
you have a second about this beverage

565
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,500
never uses tablets you know you guys

566
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,820
know tablets

567
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,240
tablets

568
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,559
tablets right because tablets have

569
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,760
glazes

570
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,740
fillers titanium dioxide colors Bemidji

571
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,360
uses capsules if they're not just using

572
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,059
liquids pure liquids you're using

573
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,600
capsules to get away from the tablet

574
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,940
that's how advanced they are it's almost

575
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,360
like whoa how can you how far can you go

576
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,059
really you know so anyway with vitamin C

577
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,520
which is really cool right there's

578
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,980
there's vitamin C out there but there's

579
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,200
ascorbic acid now personally in my

580
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,360
opinion from what I've seen people go

581
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,640
through with vitamin C and ascorbic acid

582
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,740
I've seen it bother people's stomachs

583
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,600
that's what I've seen I've talked to a

584
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,179
lot of doctors over the years and I've

585
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,659
had doctors tell me that their patients

586
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:07,440
stomachs were being bothered by ascorbic

587
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:10,140
acid vitamin C right and vimergy doesn't

588
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,240
use all that straight ascorbic acid so

589
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,919
that's really just awesome all in its

590
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
own so

591
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,580
I give you a quick rundown a couple

592
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,159
other things I have right here all right

593
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,500
so uh let me get some

594
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,559
get a little water in here

595
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm gonna take some other things too

596
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,679
right first of all I'm going to take a

597
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,080
couple of capsules right here

598
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,179
uh micro C

599
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,720
m

600
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:39,120
set those down okay

601
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,520
and then um

602
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,500
so the whole thing with like the

603
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,179
spiritual connection matters to me so I

604
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,159
think about that with everything I take

605
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,799
so then when I take

606
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,679
some curcumin right

607
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:57,900
I think about the same thing I connect

608
00:24:52,679 --> 00:25:00,179
to the turmeric rhizome right the root I

609
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:04,559
connect to it right there that's what I

610
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:09,120
do I like to I like to visualize

611
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:12,240
okay that I'm actually sending a message

612
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,299
to the farm where it came out of I like

613
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,679
to connect to the Earth it came out of I

614
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,980
like to make that spiritual connection

615
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,320
that Soul connection to that Purity

616
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,720
right the one thing right here

617
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,299
which is amazing about the curcumin

618
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,159
which I like when I take it right is

619
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,840
there's no black pepper in there because

620
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,700
in my opinion black pepper is an

621
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,020
irritant because you see people they're

622
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,900
like well there's black pepper in my

623
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,460
curcue bin right and but meanwhile you

624
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,440
know I got all kinds of problems my

625
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,820
digestive out there you'll hear that out

626
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,320
there I've seen it before I've had

627
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,820
doctor friends tell me this patients

628
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,320
have all kinds of Crohn's colitis and

629
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,120
all these different conditions they're

630
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,100
patients right and the doctor would be

631
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,659
telling me like they're on a curcumin

632
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,460
everything like that that'd be like as a

633
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,720
black pepper in that one like yeah they

634
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,820
said there's lots of black pepper in

635
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,400
there it's like you know in my opinion

636
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,100
you know tell a doctor friend that my

637
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,020
opinion for sure taking not having a

638
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,120
black pepper is good because it's an

639
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,559
irritant right and Verma G doesn't do

640
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,140
the whole black pepper thing which is

641
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,700
really cool right

642
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,500
curcumin turmeric

643
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,720
and that's there's a combination of both

644
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,880
in here the whole turmeric and also the

645
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,559
curcumin in this one great for the

646
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,000
immune system to support the immune

647
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,419
system so take one of these down

648
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,620
nighttime routine mm-hmm

649
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,460
okay

650
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,980
now I take Goldenseal

651
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,539
all the time right so I take it every

652
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,059
single night for my nighttime routine

653
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:38,760
golden seal speaks for itself it always

654
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:40,380
has it just speaks for itself right

655
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,539
there right

656
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,520
and of course you know the vibration the

657
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:48,299
frequency and that's another thing right

658
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,240
I can hold supplements

659
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:53,279
hold them in my hands you know

660
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,940
and I can feel the frequency and the

661
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,279
vibration within the supplementation and

662
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,260
and you you may have that too you may

663
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,980
have that ability too you may have that

664
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,799
same ability right to actually be able

665
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,740
to feel that vibration

666
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:12,419
to feel that energetic connection so

667
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,760
that's what I do with my supplements

668
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:17,279
I've had people hand me supplementation

669
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,260
right in my hand and be like this and

670
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,720
like no no it's great it's great I would

671
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:25,559
hold it and instantly going right up my

672
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,659
arm boom into my into my body into my

673
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,760
system right up to my neurons I can feel

674
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:33,000
the vibration the frequency I can

675
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,299
connect to that spiritual nature to that

676
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,580
product and I can be like no no way give

677
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:41,640
me another one to try oh I could feel it

678
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,799
and feel that that sensation the

679
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,360
difference between the spiritual nature

680
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,400
the difference between the purification

681
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,559
the energy and the frequency I can feel

682
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,480
it right and that's what I can do and

683
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:53,279
that's the difference like pure cilantro

684
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,059
right

685
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,340
I can feel it in the cilantro okay

686
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,679
and that's that's you know just like

687
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,039
that I can feel it in here and it should

688
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,860
feel the same way as pure and the

689
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,919
frequency to that plant I should feel

690
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,360
the same way when I hold

691
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,659
right there

692
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,940
right when I hold that or I hold the

693
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:19,799
propolis which is an insane frequency

694
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,480
for me right there so that's another one

695
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,520
right there I want to talk about that

696
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,220
for a second right

697
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,200
I should feel the same frequency

698
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,760
when you're feeling that living plant

699
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,640
right out of your garden when you're

700
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,100
feeling that live plant these are the

701
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,679
things I think about on my my like

702
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,720
moment at night that five minutes I get

703
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,880
that eight minutes I get at night before

704
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,580
bed these are the things I have to think

705
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,520
about all the time right it's that kind

706
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,840
of thing for my own life and so now I

707
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,159
want to just talk to you guys about my

708
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,440
nighttime routine but I want to tell you

709
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,720
it's not just about what I take it's

710
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,779
about everything that goes into it and

711
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,419
everything that goes about it like the

712
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:03,120
propolis the connection to the quality

713
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:05,580
of that propolis

714
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,480
which is incredible the quality that

715
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,940
they have like you can check

716
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,980
themergy.com and you check it out and

717
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,900
you can talk to them you'll hear they'll

718
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,120
tell you about how what's really going

719
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,400
on with this propolis right anyway I

720
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,520
could feel that I know that frequency

721
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,860
that vibration and that connection and

722
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,059
it's the same thing as like the gold

723
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,120
seal but I'm going to take some gold and

724
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,320
seal now because I take gold and seal

725
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,299
um

726
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,760
and here's the thing with Goldenseal

727
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,860
you'll know it when you taste it too

728
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,299
when it enters your body if you're

729
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,600
spiritually connected if you're

730
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:42,059
connected even if look even if maybe

731
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,440
your connection is buried

732
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:47,520
right

733
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,779
maybe it's buried but other things in

734
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,159
your life but it's still there

735
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,740
Underneath It All

736
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,919
that frequency that connection that

737
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,480
vibration your spiritual connection your

738
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,980
Consciousness right connecting to your

739
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,039
subconsciousness connection to your soul

740
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,720
right all of that could be suppressed

741
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,640
you could be somebody where it's

742
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,159
suppressed

743
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,740
but you still have it in you

744
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,919
but it's hard to use it

745
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,500
when you have products that aren't pure

746
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,080
right so when you're using products that

747
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,820
aren't pure it's hard to decipher and

748
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,220
weed through and navigate through those

749
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,260
products so if you have this vibration

750
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,720
the spiritual connection this energetic

751
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,120
connection you have the intuitive power

752
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,500
inside of you but it's suppressed and

753
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,779
it's buried

754
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,039
and you're then with some junky products

755
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,360
or some products that are low quality

756
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,100
and all this that have natural flavors

757
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,559
and all this other stuff in it right

758
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,840
you may not be able to fish through that

759
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,020
to navigate through that yet in your

760
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,399
life because it's suppressed right or

761
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,840
you may be somebody where it's not

762
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,779
suppressed and you have that that

763
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,700
intuition spot on not just intuition but

764
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,380
your frequency your vibration everything

765
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,779
is just on you're spiritually connected

766
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,760
all of it's on right so then you know

767
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,620
and that's when you know when you have

768
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,380
also a good goal until that's how I do

769
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:09,240
it too it's like okay well then yeah

770
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:11,880
um and you can feel it go down right

771
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,880
same thing with propolis right

772
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,440
I've tried every propolis almost every

773
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,880
single propolis I could ever get my

774
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,480
hands on out there because I've always

775
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,340
been a propolis fiend because of soc

776
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,299
telling me propolis is so important

777
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,299
right

778
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:28,200
and so good so I've tried so many and so

779
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,600
many

780
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,520
that say they're alcohol free but still

781
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,080
have propylene glycol in it it's so

782
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,440
confusing like the whole thing is

783
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,840
confusing and that's a thing like that's

784
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,399
what you you don't have to disclose the

785
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,380
tiniest bit of stuff that's out there

786
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,480
for so many reasons for so many people

787
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,020
out there but the point is is that this

788
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,000
right here I mean you know when you

789
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,220
actually use it the difference if you've

790
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,020
used other propolises you know the

791
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,600
difference right you know the difference

792
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,220
it's like when when you get when you get

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,559
that hit

794
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,460
and you taste it and the thing is is

795
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,580
this

796
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,159
that I connect to that that's my

797
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,140
nighttime routine it's knowing all these

798
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,240
things right and connecting to it which

799
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,039
is really really it's fun too in the

800
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,620
sense because you it's something that

801
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,020
it's just it feels so good

802
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,840
a licorice

803
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:25,500
so I've been taking licorice forever

804
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,020
it's just one of those herbs right that

805
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,840
I've been taking forever so I just I'm

806
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,740
I've Loved licorice from when I was a

807
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,539
child

808
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,000
I take it it's part of my nighttime

809
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:38,760
routine because I've been taking it my

810
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,740
whole life and I just love it and I've

811
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,020
had to deal with low quality licorice's

812
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,480
when I was younger I had to deal with

813
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,640
low quality licorice products I had to

814
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,200
deal with licorice types of candy that

815
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,240
weren't the fake candy but the real

816
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,340
licorice candy right I've had to deal

817
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,960
with those I've had to deal with all the

818
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,279
different forms of licorice licorice

819
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,340
powders

820
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:01,980
where I've had some bad licorice powders

821
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,080
out there throughout the years 20 30

822
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,279
years ago trying different licorice's

823
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,140
I've had licorice where there was

824
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,200
alcohol in it lots of alcohol in the

825
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,080
licorice all these things and I waited

826
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,320
like a lifetime for a company to step it

827
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,620
up to actually step it up into gear

828
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,500
and make a licorice that I can feel good

829
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,260
about taking for myself and recommend a

830
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,640
friend a loved one anybody and

831
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,960
especially someone with chronic illness

832
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,880
right out there in the world knowing

833
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,279
that when they go to their doctor they

834
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,840
say hey to their doctor hey Dr MD can I

835
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,220
take this licorice knowing that the

836
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
doctor might be like whoa that stuff

837
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,659
looks good but

838
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,140
the point is my whole life I've been

839
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:45,899
waiting for like a licorice that stood

840
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,720
apart that stands apart

841
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:49,980
and no no junk in it of all these

842
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,200
different kinds of things like you know

843
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,779
the whole bit and that's the key right

844
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,919
there like high quality so I take

845
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,080
licorice

846
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,779
myself I've been taking it my whole life

847
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,940
I love the taste of Licorice and when

848
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:05,640

849
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,099

taste right that vibration that

853
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,000
frequency because of herbs

854
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,460

921
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,740
there's a reason why you're using

922
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,240
stimulants there's a reason why and it's

923
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,940
not your fault

924
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,740
it's not your fault you're not the

925
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,540
reason why you're a mommy that might be

926
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,220
on all this caffeine while breastfeeding

927
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,200
or you're you're somebody that's on all

928
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,760
this caffeine or you're a runner and you

929
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,320
know you're an actual Runner out there

930
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,820
and you run races and you do all these

931
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,079
things and you're jacked up on all these

932
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,520
energy drinks and caffeine and

933
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,380
everything else that has done I'm not

934
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,020
saying any of that's bad bad I'm just

935
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,839
saying that I choose not to do it

936
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,920
I choose to stay off of all the

937
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,599
stimulants

938
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,140
that's what I do in my personal life

939
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:20,280
that's how I am so stimulant free but

940
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:24,660
then I want to rely on Nature's real

941
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,839
natural natural right energetic the

942
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:30,660
vibration of nature things that are that

943
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,900
are important for our bodies and our

944
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,359
bodies needs right the more our body

945
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,599
utilizes things right and so you know I

946
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:40,980
like a pure B12 like this is the

947
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,700
adenosilcobalamin methylcobalamin the

948
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,700
right balance

949
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,980
right so that's the one right there

950
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,599
so anyway you guys

951
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,740
just run through some of these things

952
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,839
right there

953
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,220
but I don't do caffeine and if you're

954
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:59,099
doing caffeine I don't judge you because

955
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,140
you might be stuck doing the caffeine

956
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:04,020
because you're trying to survive that's

957
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:06,300
what I mean I don't judge you I don't

958
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,099
right because I know that you might be

959
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,599
tired you might be fatigued you might be

960
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,160
having problems you might be like

961
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,599
energetically down you might be

962
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,640
struggling you might have stress you

963
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,320
might have losses you might have all

964
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,540
these different things and in the

965
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
caffeine is pushing you through and I

966
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,560
will never ever

967
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,960
ever doubt you

968
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,579
for who you are and why you have to use

969
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,660
a stimulant to survive and push through

970
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,700
you don't think I don't have friends

971
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,320
that have really hard situations where

972
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,960
they've had to start the stimulants all

973
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,460
the way from childhood you know so yeah

974
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,619
I totally get it

975
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,720
I'm all about of course getting you know

976
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,160
getting healthier healthier strong

977
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,200
strengths you don't need stimulants but

978
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,160
whatever that's another talk on another

979
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,300
day anyway what I love about the B12 is

980
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,800
no natural flavors

981
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,619
no flavors

982
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,359
in there if you guys just got on here

983
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,800
talking about why I support them regime

984
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,480
talking about my nighttime routine if

985
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,099
you just got on now I fully endorse

986
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,099
Bemidji because it's about high time

987
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:07,500
because I want them to be out there I

988
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:09,420
need people to know there are

989
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,040
opportunities where there is really

990
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,440
incredible stuff out there and I don't

991
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,079
want that to disappear someday you know

992
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,960
I want to give my full support and

993
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,579
pledge my full support to a company

994
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,800
that's actually doing things that I

995
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,180
haven't seen anybody do out there the

996
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
four incredible things I talked about

997
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,540
earlier so if you just got here now

998
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,300
watch us from the beginning and you'll

999
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,760
hear the four incredible things where it

1000
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,980
is mind-blowing to what the company does

1001
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,320
and the difference and how it works and

1002
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:39,180
when you hear those you be the judge and

1003
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,520
I'm telling you right now it's like it's

1004
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,740
it's mind-blowing really okay so I just

1005
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,380
want to say that right a little later

1006
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,900
after dinner I'll show you how I take my

1007
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,420
wind down supplements if you guys just

1008
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,859
got here after dinner which I'm gonna

1009
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,460
make some food I'm going to talk about

1010
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:59,579
my winding down supplementation which

1011
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,640
I'm going to show you I take and what I

1012
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,220
visualize and what I see and all of it

1013
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,960
so I'm excited about that right there so

1014
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,520
and the thing is I didn't even talk

1015
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,780
about these wind down supplements but

1016
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,700
we'll talk about them in a little bit

1017
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,180
and I'm excited about that so I'm going

1018
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,940
to make some noise right here

1019
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,300
so I like Nori's at night because it's

1020
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,820
light I don't want a lump of lead I

1021
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,640
don't want a big hunk of bacon or a pork

1022
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:28,859
chop in my gullet what I'm trying to

1023
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,780
fall asleep you know what I mean like I

1024
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,640
don't want that happening you know I

1025
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,839
mean let's look if you if you want to do

1026
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,060
that if you want to have pork chops

1027
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,520
before bed I'm just totally right I get

1028
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:41,880
it 100 that's fine but I like something

1029
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,520
lighter and it changes for me too it

1030
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,579
changes this isn't the like only thing I

1031
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,740
have every single night it's not that I

1032
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:51,480
just have you know it's not that I just

1033
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,579
have this right here where I'm having

1034
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,640
Nori rolls and that's only it and that's

1035
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,440
all so I eat a lot of different things

1036
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,780
you guys have known throughout all the

1037
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,560
time so let me just get a blade out here

1038
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,300
all right so first of all I'm gonna chop

1039
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,940
up a few things let me chop up a pepper

1040
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,980
really quick I love Peppers right I love

1041
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,980
all different kinds of peppers too okay

1042
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,320
so this is a bell pepper right

1043
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,540
so so what I'm doing is I'm cutting some

1044
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,460
slices of bell pepper right here okay so

1045
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,599
I'm going to cut a few slices

1046
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,599
real quick here

1047
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,900
all right

1048
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,000
and then

1049
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm going to line this into the Nori

1050
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,460
right here if you can see this right

1051
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,460
there

1052
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:38,760
okay this is really fresh and this is a

1053
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,220
live and that's another thing too I like

1054
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,300
doing raw dinners not like cooked

1055
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,460
dinners too

1056
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,619
I like cooked dinners okay don't get me

1057
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,020
wrong but I also like raw dinners

1058
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:50,280
because of the frequency all of it you

1059
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:53,400
know everything about it here's an

1060
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,440
orange right here I'm gonna moisten that

1061
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,880
I'm gonna moisten this in a second I'm

1062
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,619
just not going to moisten it yet because

1063
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,020
if you moisten it too early what happens

1064
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,020
is all of a sudden it just shrivels up

1065
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,119
it gets all wet it falls apart right

1066
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,619
and so that's important to know right

1067
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,680
there

1068
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,680
um

1069
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,820
let's go a little bit more on this let's

1070
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:17,220
do it so let's get some Tomatoes going

1071
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:20,099
so I got red bell not red but I got

1072
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,420
sorry red cherry tomatoes here I also

1073
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,000
have these other

1074
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,220
larger cherry tomatoes right so I'm

1075
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,920
cutting these up a little bit I'm gonna

1076
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,500
put some nice fresh tomatoes in this

1077
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,320
roll up right there you can make these

1078
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:36,900
as fat as you want you can make them

1079
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,339
as skinny as you as skinny as you know

1080
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,740
you want with these two like you can

1081
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:44,240
make these rollers real big you can make

1082
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:48,900
these roll ups really

1083
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:53,040
thin you can do either or I love this as

1084
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:56,220
a nighttime meal because of the fact

1085
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,579
that it's all living right so I like

1086
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,339
knowing that the food is all alive now

1087
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:04,079
if you know like medical medium recipes

1088
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:07,680
and everything you know we do lots of

1089
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,560
cooked ones right we do we do um lots of

1090
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,420
raw ones you have the choices you

1091
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,400
they're there for you which is amazing

1092
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:16,800
that's what's incredible about it it's

1093
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,220
not one size fits all so that's the

1094
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,680
incredible thing about mm info it's not

1095
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,079
one size fits all and I'll give you an

1096
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,660
example this is just one of my nighttime

1097
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,700
routines right here this supplementation

1098
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,440
for what's happening in my life in the

1099
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,240
moment for what I'm going through what

1100
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm doing see that's why it's not one

1101
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,240
size fits off it was one size fits all

1102
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,260
then this would be the only thing

1103
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,140
forever

1104
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:41,880
but it's not it changes could change in

1105
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:44,160
two weeks it could change in a week it

1106
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,980
can change in like a month but it's

1107
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,980
never one size fits all because we

1108
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,300
change right what's happening around us

1109
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:53,280
changes

1110
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,780
which is really you know interesting

1111
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,720
right that's just life so I'm putting

1112
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,579
some onion right here okay I sliced it

1113
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,319
kind of thin

1114
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:03,180
so what I did

1115
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,980
sliced it kind of thin you guys see that

1116
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,540
right there okay

1117
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:09,180
so we got that

1118
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:11,640
now let's get a little bit of cilantro

1119
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,400
in here so what I do is you can couple

1120
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,240
of options you can cut the cilantro

1121
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,240
chop it up right

1122
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:24,359
recommend chopping it up if you want it

1123
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,760
in a roll up

1124
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,680
because the stems

1125
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,119
get a little bit problematic now I'm

1126
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,700
using which what you're seeing right

1127
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,680
here what you're noticing is I'm using

1128
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,200
the cilantro as a leafy green if you

1129
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,560
guys came on here just now I talked

1130
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,140
about some powerful reasons why I use

1131
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,839
the beverage supplements right and and

1132
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,880
I've been and now you know like my God

1133
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,400
the stuff is so incredible for what

1134
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,280
they're doing the connection that I have

1135
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,440
with them spiritually and emotionally

1136
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,720
and the vibrations and the frequencies

1137
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,640
everything I talked about right

1138
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,560
it's amazing and I love to make a

1139
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,760
connection to my food too and that's

1140
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,440
what we're talking about here so I'm

1141
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,420
putting a little onion in here

1142
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,720
right there right

1143
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,940
there we go and well I like to connect

1144
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,700
to the food I'm making so I think about

1145
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,859
the onions I think about the power

1146
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,200
onions have right because onions are

1147
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:22,079
incredible for the immune system onions

1148
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,940
are an herb and I like to remember that

1149
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,740
see a lot of people forget that onions

1150
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,300
or herbs and they don't make that

1151
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,400
connections it's important to make that

1152
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,619
connection because you're looking at

1153
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,760
herbal medicine with an onion that's

1154
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:35,220
what you're looking at you're looking at

1155
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,260
herbal medicine with an onion so I like

1156
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:39,180
having that connection to an onion like

1157
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,380
that right which is important to me so

1158
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,740
I'm going to put a little bit of this

1159
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,359
orange and think about what it took for

1160
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,400
this orange to grow so my nighttime

1161
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,619
routine is about all these things this

1162
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,319
is it right here it's about thinking

1163
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:54,300
about this orange and then psychically

1164
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,619
trying to connect to where this orange

1165
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,200
came from

1166
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:02,040
what tree it came off of

1167
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,599
if I sit there in a meditation just for

1168
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,540
one or two minutes

1169
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,099
I can connect to the tree even if I

1170
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:10,319
don't know where the tree really is but

1171
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,060
I can connect to I can transport that

1172
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,800
connection right that frequency and

1173
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,300
connect to that frequency continuity I

1174
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,940
can make continuity between the orange

1175
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,240
and my hand and to the tree it came from

1176
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,579
and I love to do that at night when I'm

1177
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,260
making you know food when I'm eating the

1178
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,540
food I'm putting a couple of drops on

1179
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,520
here on the sheet

1180
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,380
and I'm gonna be making a dipping sauce

1181
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,339
any second so I'm just going to roll

1182
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,560
this up

1183
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:37,920
and then I'm gonna make a nice dipping

1184
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,900
sauce now the dipping sauce is hot you

1185
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,880
may not like hot stuff then keep the

1186
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,099
heat out and that's okay so that's a

1187
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,180
Nori roll right there that's a on the

1188
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:49,920
thinner side okay all right that's on

1189
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,900
the thinner side right there let me just

1190
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,480
give you a little close-up on that Nori

1191
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,220
roll on a nice plate so you can see that

1192
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,859
close-up okay there it is wow it's

1193
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,599
amazing great focus on that I love it so

1194
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:03,900
that's the Nori roll right there that's

1195
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:06,240
a thin one it's alive it's fresh it's

1196
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,460
living it's got the orange squeezed

1197
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,079
orange right to moisten it it's ready

1198
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,060
let's make a dipping sauce and then

1199
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,940
we'll make a couple more rolls

1200
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,020
pumped up about it I really am dipping

1201
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,359
sauce

1202
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,579
it's gonna be an orange dipping sauce

1203
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:23,880
right

1204
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:24,660
don't throw around glass balls

1205
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,660
yeah

1206
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,940
so you know here it is cut the orange

1207
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,760
squeeze the orange

1208
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,619
right in I mean even

1209
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,839
grab a little bit of a strainer really

1210
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,520
quick squeeze that through so I'm

1211
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,400
catching the seeds to make life easy

1212
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,579
right here while we're live

1213
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,880
while we're live and doing this

1214
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:49,260
so I'm making this orange juice dipping

1215
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,440
sauce

1216
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:55,319
which I just absolutely adore because

1217
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,079
I've had it so many times in my life and

1218
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:01,020
I love it because it's so fresh it's so

1219
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,140
alive and I think about the vitamin C

1220
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,839
that's in that orange juice right

1221
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:09,180
you know right that Sailors on the ocean

1222
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:12,480
you heard this I talked about this in

1223
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:15,839
early podcasts Sailors on the ocean if

1224
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,760
they didn't have a lime or a lemon or an

1225
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,740
orange and they were out there on the

1226
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,940
water too long

1227
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:27,119
the men would get scurvy right that

1228
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,839
their immune systems would fall apart

1229
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,440
they would just lose their vitality

1230
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:36,480
right they were they could not exist on

1231
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,940
jerky because that's what they had they

1232
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,579
had jerkies what they had right so it

1233
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:44,400
was only jerky that's all they had they

1234
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:46,740
were chewing that jerky and then

1235
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,780
they would lose

1236
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:53,339
their health

1237
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:56,280
because they did not have that vitamin C

1238
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:57,900
which was critical so we're making a

1239
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,420
dipping sauce right

1240
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,859
that's looking good right there

1241
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:05,099
all right

1242
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:06,720
so in this dipping sauce I'm gonna put a

1243
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:09,119
little bit of honey in this dipping

1244
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,980
sauce let's go

1245
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,740
you guys know how I feel about honey

1246
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:18,359
right another thing I like to connect

1247
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:20,400
you right there is the honey now I put a

1248
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,859
decent amount in there because I'm

1249
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,119
making this dipping sauce hot that's the

1250
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:26,119
way I like it right

1251
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:31,140
and

1252
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,940
that's the way I really like it let me

1253
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,920
mix this up right there to begin with so

1254
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,180
I have the

1255
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,400
um

1256
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,640
I got the honey in here with the orange

1257
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,560
juice let me just mix this up right

1258
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,560
there you go

1259
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:50,880
get that moving in there

1260
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:53,760
so this is a sweet and hot sauce

1261
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,619
I love it at night it's got the glucose

1262
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,859
from the orange juice it's got the

1263
00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:00,900
glucose incredible glucose from the raw

1264
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:02,700
honey which is incredible on its own

1265
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,540
right you're talking about the glucose

1266
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,780
and then you're talking about

1267
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,520
phytochemical compounds in the honey you

1268
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,380
guys probably heard my podcast right the

1269
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,300
raw honey podcast episode

1270
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,800
Right medical meeting podcasts at Apple

1271
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,960
podcast

1272
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,220
okay so I don't know if you've if you've

1273

1274
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:22,440
all right mixing that up a little bit

1275
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:25,700
now I need the heat

1276
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,700
so I need some peppers

1277
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,599

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,220
wait

1470
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,599

1471
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:02,220
oh my God

1472
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:04,700
hold on I'm just gonna torture myself

1473
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,700
one more time

1474
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,680
okay

1475
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:13,099
that is hot that's really hot let me

1476
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,099
tell you something

1477
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:17,540
delegate your sinuses to run

1478
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,540
um

1479
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:24,140
that's medicine right there

1480
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:24,140
that's all I could say that's medicine

1481
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,460
um

1482
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:32,960
just so you know

1483
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:32,960
I grew these Peppers right

1484
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,660
should I grew these peppers

1485
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:42,299
amazing cayennes I love growing my own

1486
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,980
peppers hot peppers and then I love

1487
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:47,280
connecting with them they're grown for

1488
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:49,700
me right they're grown for what my body

1489
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,200
needs because a plant can actually

1490
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,180
detect what your body needs when you're

1491
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,040
growing it yourself so you're sitting

1492
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,140
here you're watering it

1493
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,280
you grab a couple of caterpillars off

1494
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,859
the plant

1495
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,140
you you pluck a couple of leaves that

1496
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:06,000
are kind of like a little dried up and

1497
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,799
you just you nurture that plant you take

1498
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,960
care of that plant and that plant knows

1499
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:11,640
you it knows you it knows you're going

1500
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,260
to consume the food it knows you're in

1501
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,839
touch with it it knows who you are

1502
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:18,059
plants know who we are when we're

1503
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,980
nurturing that plant that plant's

1504
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,680
receiving that nurturing it's receiving

1505
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,240
that information

1506
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,740
it's receiving that vibration that

1507
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,000
frequency it's receiving all that and

1508
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,500
then we're connecting that's how it

1509
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,280
works I'm gonna have one more of these

1510
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:35,660
and I'm gonna do my time T real quick

1511
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,660
remember one more if you guys

1512
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:41,660
come on

1513
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,660
what's insane

1514
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,980
hmm

1515
00:59:44,819 --> 00:59:49,920
I usually go back to work after there

1516
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:51,359
but since I'm not working

1517
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,220
since I'm not working tonight I'm just

1518
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,319
talking to you guys which is really fun

1519
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,119
I'm going to show you my sleeping

1520
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:59,160
routine really quick but let's just make

1521
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,260
some time tea really quick got a cup

1522
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,839
right here boom

1523
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,440
need some time got some time right here

1524
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,299
time that came out of my garden right

1525
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,579
I'm going to put this time right in that

1526
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:13,380
cup that's how I'm going to do it

1527
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:14,880
okay

1528
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,640
now you can do a couple different things

1529
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,200
if you want honey in here

1530
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,640
I can put a little honey in here if you

1531
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,260
want honey in your time tea take the

1532
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,960
time out first right

1533
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:26,460
put the honey in

1534
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,140
okay

1535
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,020
nice

1536
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:33,480
I think someone said way too much honey

1537
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:37,400
someone just complained

1538
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,400
instead I used way too much honey

1539
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:43,200
SOC just told me somebody's freaking out

1540
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:46,020
about how much honey I just used

1541
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,000
well I'm sorry I hope I didn't offend

1542
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,440
you

1543
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,540
listen to my last one of my last

1544
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,859
podcasts that I just did like the raw

1545
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,720
honey podcast

1546
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:56,460
check it out when you can listen to it

1547
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,540
and and recommended podcast at Apple

1548
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,160
podcast check it out when you get a

1549
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,440
chance anyway I put the honey in here

1550
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:03,960
let's get the hot water in

1551
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,819
nice

1552
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,980
I know someone's upset about how much

1553
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:09,119
honey I put in I'm not trying to get you

1554
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,099
upset

1555
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,900
I want you happy

1556
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,579
and I just want to put a little bit more

1557
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:18,500
honey in there not to make you upset

1558
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:18,500
don't get upset stop getting upset

1559
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:25,380
I'm going to mix that honey up in that

1560
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,260
because that's glucose right there for

1561
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:31,140
my brain If you hear the Honey episode

1562
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,839
you'll know what I'm talking about right

1563
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:36,720
I don't run on caffeine I don't run on

1564
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:39,119
stimulants I run on glucose because my

1565
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,920
neurons need the glucose they need it

1566
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,799
because they're firing like crazy

1567
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:47,220
because of all the because of all the

1568
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:51,240
information I have to receive from SOC I

1569
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:53,040
have a very unfun job of receiving that

1570
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,740
information and then trying to put that

1571
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:58,619
information into words as a messenger

1572
01:01:55,740 --> 01:02:00,480
for everybody else I got some incredible

1573
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:02,700
time tea going right there take a look

1574
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,839
close like that and you can take a look

1575
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:08,240
this way too

1576
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,240
right here I'm gonna sip it

1577
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:12,480
oh my God so delicious too so let's talk

1578
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,099
about the winding down part of my

1579
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,200
routine my nighttime routine where I'm

1580
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,940
winding down because God knows I need to

1581
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,440
kind of that winding down moment because

1582
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:21,900
so much is going on so much information

1583
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,880
is going on so I start with lemon balm

1584
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:27,000
right there so make sure I get my lemon

1585
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,040
balm in me okay it's a commentative

1586
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,720
that's what I love about it right and

1587
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,819
when it's high quality in my opinion man

1588
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,859
when it's pure like this there's a whole

1589
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:37,079
different frequency so it's a

1590
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:39,839
commentative right it's for the nerves

1591
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:41,720
for stress relaxation so I like to send

1592
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:44,579
that down

1593
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:47,220
boom that's down right there okay so

1594
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,960
let's get some Gaba going

1595
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:52,339
how about that

1596
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,339
a little bit of Gaba going

1597
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,520
right

1598
01:02:54,599 --> 01:03:02,240
so here we are

1599
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:05,339
Gaba counters excess brain stimulation

1600
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,740
so think about that I mean in your life

1601
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:08,819
how much excess brain stimulation do you

1602
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,079
have

1603
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:12,359
you know ask your doctor what's right

1604
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,720
for you whatever but I have a lot of

1605
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:17,280
excess brain stimulation too much from

1606
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,680
everything that's going on from hearing

1607
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,240
SOC from living my life having all the

1608
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,760
responsibilities from doing all the work

1609
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:25,500
right so a lot of stimulation right

1610
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,260
there

1611
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,000
hmm

1612
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:32,339
send that Gaba down right there next

1613
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,040
magnesium

1614
01:03:32,339 --> 01:03:37,500
right helps with muscles that's the

1615
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:39,599
whole thing too magnesium helps with

1616
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,420
muscles

1617
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:46,520
okay I love it for the nervous system

1618
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:46,520
too it's another thing too all right

1619
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:54,720
magnesium Down the Hatch and then

1620
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,280
right before I go to bed this is how I

1621
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,839
do it okay you ask your doctor what's

1622
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,740
right for you and all that but how I do

1623
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:05,480
it is I take my melatonin right before I

1624
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:05,480
turn off the light and go to bed

1625
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,380
foreign
