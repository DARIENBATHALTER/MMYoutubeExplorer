condition you're far from from

generates a whole bunch of love and at

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,120

22
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:15,080

the potato has caused a lot of Rifts

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,320
they fry them in oil and turn them into

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,560
chips scaring people to never eat them

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,380

are really

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,519
good do you think they're like a th000

50
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,760
calories no they're not 1,000 calories

51
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,000
pH I was kind of getting worried right

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,319
there for a minute what 2500

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,159
calories they're that bad it's all

54
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,120
starch uh I'll just work out tomorrow

55
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,120
more it doesn't matter I'll do extra

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,200
workout this is my cheat day anyway I'm

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,360
going to enjoy it and not feel guilty

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,879
it's all about

59
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,120
balance in some ways what you just heard

60
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:10,400
here wasn't a cheat day if it was just

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,640
the potato but while everybody's focus

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:18,120
on the carb aspect they're missing the

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:21,400
most important concern there is the oil

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,280
that's the cheat day part it's not the

65
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:29,040
potato it's the fat on the potato and

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,760
that's where the bad calories are doing

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,920
the extra work out the next day is only

68
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:39,000
to clean up the oil mess not the carb

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,680
mess the oil slick mess carbs on their

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,360
own they're safe carbs with oils and

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:51,400
fats are a problem any carb with oil and

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,079
fat is what the real concern should be

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,799
these days the potato always gets to

74
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,599
blame it always has in recent decades

75
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,560
and probably always will

76
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,680
mostly because the health world is a

77
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:10,840
pile of guessing games Hit or Miss hit

78
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,439
or miss miss hit hit Miss got it there

79
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,640
nope didn't work that might work uh

80
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,400
maybe that'll work later no it didn't

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,000
try again hit Miss again guessing game

82
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,040
There You Go Round the Corner Round the

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,919
Bend never ends guessing game when

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,600

alternative medicine had to offer every

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,360
approach and someone tells you hey just

90
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,000

like that'll fix it after all the

96
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,039
doctors and all the years I've been sick

97
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,520
just see what works for me that's that's

98
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,960
how to do it that's how you're doing it

99
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
so that's how you're getting better so

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,320

never sick and you're telling me that um

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,120
don't we all just have human bodies and

103
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
when we're really sick there should be

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,199
an answer out there just try something

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,840
and see if that works isn't that like a

106
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,199
guessing game and within the world of

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,600
guessing games one of the things that

108
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,560
takes the blame is potato like must be

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,240
the potato did you take that out of your

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,560
diet cuz that could be causing all your

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,160
problems in the guessing game world

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,680
that's how it works when it comes to

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,800
having a health symptom or condition and

114
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,919
trying to find relief in the guessing

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,120
game world or hit or miss World this

116
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,039
could happen if you got acne the potato

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,080
did it if you have a weight problem the

118
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,960
potato did it there are countless

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,440
mistakes in the Health Arena what's good

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,680
what's bad is that good is that bad is

121
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,639
that bad yeah that's good no that's bad

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,919
and a lot of innocent bystanders got

123
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,160
mauled because of it the potato was just

124
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,319
sitting there mining its own business

125
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,919
and we grabbed it shoved it in a big gun

126
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,039
and shot it 300 M an hour across a field

127
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,360
and when it hit somebody in the head and

128
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,000
nearly killed them it was the potato's

129
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,680
fault not the dude who shoved it in the

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,840
potato gun and shot it it's the potato's

131
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,680
fault Let's Pretend something let's do

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
some make believe Let's Pretend There's

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,360
millions of people in the world that are

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,520
sick struggling and suffering with

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,759
countless symptoms and they've been to

136
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,240
all these different doctors exhausted

137
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,199
all resources looked at every scientific

138
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,639
study about their illness that they can

139
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,360
find and they were still sick with no

140
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,800
answers oh wait that's not make believe

141
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,360
there's no pretending that because

142
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,479
that's true it's reality okay okay no

143
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,720
pretending there's millions of people

144
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,360
sick no one knows why yes they got a

145
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,440
label for their disease or symptom like

146
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,280
fibromyalgia neurological Lyme Hashim

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,599
modus thyroiditis but still no one knows

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,599
the cause the true cause so it's a

149
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,639
random Blame Game a pick and choose

150
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,759
that's how it's done and since no one

151
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,039
knows why people are sick with chronic

152
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,360
illness we need a Fall Guy or as many

153
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,479
Fall Guys as we can find or produce or

154
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,080
get or just get somewhere find somewhere

155
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:36,599
or whatever and someone a Fall Guy was

156
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,440
thrown in the mix and a mistake was made

157
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,879
that's how all the theories of mistakes

158
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,960
are made or created because when there

159
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,039
aren't any answers to why someone's

160
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,159
suffering one mistake two mistake three

161
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:53,159
mistake four occurs one potato two

162
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:56,720
potato three potato four um one potato

163
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:00,800
two potato three potato four one potato

164
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,599
two potato what wait wait a minute

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,560
potato that's why everybody's sick right

166
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,440
now it's like the makers of the health

167
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,159
theories and mistakes stumble across the

168
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,919
reasons in a children's rhyme or hearing

169
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,960
something out there or finding something

170
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:21,000
because really you're grasping at straws

171
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,599
when you don't know why people are sick

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,240
excuse me excuse me is that potato on my

173
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:32,200
dish I can't eat that can you remove it

174
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,719
please what no it's cooked fine I just

175
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,039
can't eat it why uh it's cuz it's a

176
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:42,039
night shade um what's a

177
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,000
Nightshade not really sure but it sounds

178
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,519
really scary it sounds shady and my

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,200
health Guru told me to avoid it I think

180
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,240
it means they grow at night or they give

181
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,680
a lot of shade I really don't know I'm

182
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,360

191
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,560
mistakes are made every day and the

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,560
potato gets thrown in the PO of mistakes

193
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,320
when potato took the hit more than 20

194
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,000
years ago as being a problem no one was

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,200

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000

shouldn't have had those hash browns

212
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,480
just now what was I thinking what gets

213
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
overlooked along with so many things is

214
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,800
the butter

215
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:39,560
the milk cream sour cream oils lard

216
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,120
cheese bacon vinegar Mayo egg and gluten

217
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,800
nitrates and

218
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,480
antibiotics these get ignored if you're

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,120
convinced it's the potato or a doctor or

220
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,399
practitioner got sold on the potato bill

221
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,160
of goods or read something in some

222
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,360
article or in a meeting at a convention

223
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,240
that potato was bad then you get nervous

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,360
and you avoid it there's no science that

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,560
can prove or ever proved that potato was

226
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,600
a problem or caused a problem and very

227
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,399
few people eat a potato by itself

228
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,200
without a dressing or a condiment or

229
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,120
foods like Dairy and gluten with it do

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,160
you know anybody who just eats Potato by

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,040
itself or with lettuce no oil no butter

232
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,279
no milk no cheese do you know anybody

233
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,160
just eating potato with none of that oh

234
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:34,240
you do you know somebody who ordered

235
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,480
just fries and only fries but wait did

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,000
you miss something they were fried in

237
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,839
oil or lard or he had some ketchup with

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,760
vinegar in it which doesn't help either

239
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,240
a person who isn't well has bigger

240
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,760
problems than a fake problem like the

241
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,639
potato it's a classic case of bait and

242
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,560
switch the cheese is fine the potato's

243
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:59,360
bad look over here the Butter's safe hey

244
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,200
the Butter's fine the potato potato's

245
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,320
dangerous hey over here the milk is good

246
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,639
but the potato's bad it's real simple

247
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,720
butter will set you up for a future

248
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,560
heart attack anyone who's somebody in

249
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,320
health telling you that butter is good

250
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,199
on anything or even in your coffee is

251
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
unaware and somehow missed the heart

252
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,720
attack memo the most important thing to

253
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,399
understand about food is what food can

254
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,480
cause a problem and why does it cause a

255
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,399
problem well you think the an are out

256
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,639
there avoid gluten process food fried

257
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,560
food you heard all of this it seems like

258
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,480
all the answers are out there already

259
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,480
there's nothing to know that's new so

260
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,839
when they say that food will cause

261
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,519
inflammation what food and why how how

262
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,440
does the food cause the inflammation

263
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,920
because there's no study or science that

264
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,680
determine white gluten causes a problem

265
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,079
no one knows it's all theories the

266
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,040
theory is not a proven factual

267
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:08,079
guaranteed answer that's why it's called

268
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,440
a theory inflammation caused by a food

269
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
is a theory science can't see what

270
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,600
happens when you choose something

271
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,079
swallow it and then monitor it with an

272
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,320
actual scope and computer and visualize

273
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,199
right in front of their eyes your cells

274
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,320
getting inflamed it hasn't happened and

275
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:27,160
it never will here's one for you why

276
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,839
would one person be able to eat whatever

277
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,600
they want and feel great while another

278
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,839
person never feels good and foods like

279
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,079
gluten make them feel worse but if it

280
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,000
was the food itself then no one would

281
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:46,000
get away with eating it one person's

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,680
inflamed one person's not if a food

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,079
causes inflammation then it's going to

284
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,440
cause inflammation in everyone but it

285
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,079
doesn't theories become sales pitches

286
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,800
someone's going to sales pitch you on

287
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,440
eltin Theory probably sell you a few

288
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,320
supplements too someone's going to sales

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,000
pitch you on a Nightshade Theory maybe

290
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,759
someone's going to pitch you on the

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,880
butter in your drink Theory or butter in

292
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:14,160
your water doesn't matter how much it

293
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,120
defies Common Sense the thing is some of

294
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,560
the theory makers don't even believe in

295
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,279
their own theories but they do believe

296
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,880
one thing the people are gullible and

297
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:27,720
will buy into these theories but what

298
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,279
they don't realize is is that people

299
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,360
aren't G

300
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,240
people are trusting there's a big

301
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,040
difference and these Theory makers take

302
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,920
advantage of trusting people and treat

303
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,360
them like they were chickens or cattle

304
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,519
any chance to cash out on a theory make

305
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:48,199
a brand out of it maybe make a lot of

306
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,279
money a theory that defies Common Sense

307
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,279
someone's going to do it people like to

308
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,720
gamble you like to gamble right gambling

309
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,480
is great who cares if you leave a

310
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,560
gambling place with only your box on

311
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,199
barefooted trying to call for a car

312
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,560
service because you gambled your car

313
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,720
away but you realize you don't have your

314
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,040
phone it's gone too lost in the bet so

315
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,079
let's gamble with your health on a

316
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,759
theory potatoes are bad you ready to

317
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,040
roll the dice is it going to come up

318
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,399
snake eyes are you going to roll a seven

319
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,279
who's got the Joker card you think your

320
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,199
cards will fall on a 21 you think that

321
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,839
little ball spinning around and around

322
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,759
and around is going to land on that high

323
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,720
number you got to watch out because the

324
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,519
potato is about to drop down a straight

325
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,959
flush and you want to be on the side of

326
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,199
the winner unless the brainwashing you

327
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,040
underwent stops you what brainwashing am

328
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:50,440
I talking about it's a Nightshade it's

329
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,519
got lectins It's too high in carbs

330
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,800
voiding nutrition make you gain weight

331
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,759
it's a white food that kind of

332
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
brainwashing and manipulating I'm not

333
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,199
talking about everybody who hears

334
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,560
something and tells someone something

335
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,160
else who tells somebody something else

336
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,680
because they heard something from

337
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,079
someone else who heard something from

338
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,720
somebody else who told somebody else I'm

339
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:14,839
talking about the people who make a

340
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,560
career out of playing guessing games

341
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,000
with People's Health the theory makers

342
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,120
why does it matter because it stops you

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,480
from eating a food that can help you who

344
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,199
cares well if you're someone who's

345
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,600
living their life a mattress in couch

346
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,920
Island and is really struggling to get

347
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,560
through their day everything counts they

348
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,680
don't have time energy money to waste on

349
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:41,600
another bad idea little things matter it

350
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,920
could be make our break in recovery so

351
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,399
being told you should fear a food that

352
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,199
could actually help you will only set

353
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,920
you back and not help you move forward

354
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,880
does a potato cause inflammation no it's

355
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,079
the foods that are eaten with a potato

356
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,720
that cause a problem they still don't

357
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:03,279
cause inflammation either but the milk

358
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:06,280
cheese butter corn oil and cream feed

359
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,480
viruses and bacteria inside our body and

360
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,439
then these bugs create the inflammation

361
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,480
they eat food they like and then

362
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,480
eliminate the food go to bathroom inside

363
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,000
your body we become the pathogens toilet

364
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,720
and this is really toxic they release

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,240
what I termed viral

366
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,320
neurotoxins these neurotoxins can cause

367
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,520
inflammation viruses and bacteria IA can

368
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,640
also burrow themselves into organs and

369
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,039
glands creating more inflammation so

370
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
it's not even the milk cheese butter and

371
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,919
gluten that causes inflammation when you

372
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,520
grab that milk carton of milk you pour

373
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,440
your glasses of milk there and you grab

374
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,440
it and you start sending it

375
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,360
down all your bugs in there are just

376
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,960
going like yeah yeah yeah there it is

377
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,640
there it is they start feeding on it and

378
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,159
eating it and that's how it goes and

379
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,720
that's what the problem is the bugs that

380
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,559
are inside of us are drinking the milk

381
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,080
that's why you could be somebody who's

382
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,280
95 years old anywhere around the world

383
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,320
or in some country somewhere and

384
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,280
drinking milk and everybody knows

385
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,679
they're drinking milk they're 95 years

386
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,440
old they feel okay they're living their

387
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,320
life everybody's like look how old you

388
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,080
are this is amazing and what do you do

389
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,159
it's like drinking milk well they don't

390
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,919
have the bugs and then when a

391
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:27,000
20-year-old drinks a glass of milk all

392
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,520
of a sudden the eczema the psoriasis an

393
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,799
acne breakout occurs stomach cramps

394
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,000
diarrhea bloating all happens and they

395
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:38,280
remove the milk and dairy things start

396
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,120
to get better and better and better

397
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,039
because they have the bugs so when that

398
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,320
person sends that milk down and drinks

399
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,280
it the bugs are drinking it at the same

400
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,039
time but guess what the potato doesn't

401
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,200
feed any viruses or bacteria but the

402
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:58,360
butter on the potato feeds the viruses

403
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,120
and bacteria potato starves viruses and

404
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,760
bacteria starves the bugs put butter on

405
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,000
the potato now we have a problem it's

406
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,600
like one is fighting the other the

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,679
potato is antiviral and the butter is

408
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,919
proviral and then we got eggs eggs feed

409
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,520
viruses and bacteria potatoes don't eat

410
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,760
eggs with their fried potatoes in the

411
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,840
morning you got a conflict of interest

412
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,400
one food is trying to save you one food

413
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,880
is not potatoes are a Nightshade what

414
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,280
does that mean the theory is that night

415
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,600
shade that are edible possess an

416
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,159
alkaloid that alkaloid could be

417
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,039
irritating to some people causing

418
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,880
inflammation what no one is told is that

419
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,960
they're looking at the alkaloid that the

420
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,919
leaves and stems of The Nightshade

421
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,400
plants have that you don't eat they're

422
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,360
looking at the potato leaves and stems

423
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,120
the tomato leaves and stems that's where

424
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,120
the alkaloid resides the alkaloid in the

425
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,400
tomato and potato is the normal edible

426
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,280
alkaloid different from the alkaloid in

427
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,120
the leaves and stems it's the normal

428
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,799
alkaloid in potato that's equal to the

429
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,559
alkaloid in lettuce raspberries Swiss

430
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,640
Shard Lamb's quarters blackberries

431
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,360
artichoke zucchini and every other

432
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,080
edible plant food certain people that

433
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,320
are considered sensitive to night shades

434
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,080
like potato have other problems that has

435
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,080
nothing to do with the potato there are

436
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,000
other things in their diet causing the

437
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,880
trouble that's feeding the root causes

438
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,919
of their symptoms and conditions the

439
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,320
problem is people eat the potato with

440
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,120
other things or they eat the potato

441
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,720
cooked wrong fried in oil baked with

442
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,520
cheese and cream mashed with butter and

443
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,720
milk baked or fried as a chip with bad

444
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,320
oil or combined with a bunch of fat

445
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,320
potato and meat potato and chicken

446
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,880
potato and pork potato and eggs potato

447
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,559
and oil potato and tofu which leads us

448
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,960
to another problem a diabetic nightmare

449
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,880
carbohydrates and fat combined causing

450
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:06,559
insulin resistance any carbohydrates and

451
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,520
fats combined causes insulin resistance

452
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,720
and the potato gets to blame the

453
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,320
carbohydrate looks like the culprit the

454
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,480
bad guy but what's really happening is

455
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,480
the fat is getting in the way of

456
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,640
insulin's job to send a message to your

457
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,279
cells to open up wide and then guide the

458
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,080
sugar into the cells so they get the

459
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:30,480
food they need and the fat gets in the

460
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,679
way and blocks it forget potato stick

461
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,120
any carbohydrate in the pitcher and the

462
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,080
exact same thing happens rice and

463
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,799
chicken the chicken fat blocks the carb

464
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,200
the sugar from the rice from entering

465
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:45,760
your cells pork and beans pork and rice

466
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,559
same thing happens there too quinoa and

467
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,720
oil oatmeal and peanut butter turkey

468
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:55,200
sandwich with meat and bread pasta and

469
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:59,440
butter the carb is always blamed as the

470
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,159
A1C Rises or hypogly lmia occurs or

471
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,400
hypoglycemia comes on but really it's

472
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,559
just a fat insulin isn't produced to dry

473
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,039
fat into your cells your cells aren't

474
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:14,240
Reliant upon fat they rely on sugar

475
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,600
glucose to survive so we can function

476
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,960
blood sugar means everything without

477
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,520
blood sugar we can't function they're

478
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,720
not testing your blood fat the fat

479
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,960
doesn't keep you alive it's not what's

480
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,200
important here it's not letting you

481
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,159
function on a day-to-day basis if it

482
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,559
drops down or you don't have fat in your

483
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,039
diet you feel great but without blood

484
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,039
sugar you're going to hit the wall or

485
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,559
the ground insulin isn't created for fat

486
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,240
it's created for sugar but the fat you

487
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:47,000
eat that enters your bloodstream stops

488
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,559
the glucose from entering cells it stays

489
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,799
in your bloodstream trapping the sugar

490
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:55,440
and driving up your A1C but the potato

491
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,559
gets the blame you know how you reverse

492
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,760
type 2 diabetes and drop your a 1 C and

493
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:05,760
put type 2 diabetes behind you and heal

494
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,720
you remove the fats and bring in lots of

495
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,320
potatoes Everything Changes insulin

496
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,480
resistance is gone I've seen it happen

497
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,320
thousands of times over the years this

498
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,360
isn't a theory it's been proven

499
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,520
successfully I taught a lot of doctors

500
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,120
how to do it for their patients let's

501
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,480
talk about weight and the potato will

502
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,080
make you fat Theory you're eating that

503
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,799
baked potato those french fries potato

504
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,799
chips cheesy potatoes mashed potatoes

505
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,760
you're going to gain weight put on

506
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,480
unwanted pounds that's what we're told

507
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,600
and it's all you hear or this is all you

508
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,000
hear carbs carbs carbs whoa too many

509
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,039
carbs lots of carbs but you won't hear

510
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,120
this fat fat look out for the fat the

511
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,880
butter the oil look out for the cream

512
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,720
the cheese look out for the milk you

513
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,080
won't hear that no one's going to say

514
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,120
whoa there's a lot of fat on those fries

515
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,960
whoa look at that grease everywhere that

516
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,919
oil look at the fat on those chips or

517
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,600
the fatty milk and cheese and butter and

518
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,760
the cheesy potatoes the mashed potatoes

519
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,760
like look out for that or the sour cream

520
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,640
on the baked potato no one blames any of

521
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,600
that instead they're just like carbs

522
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,880
carbs car carbs carbs it defies common

523
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,120
sense and you know what's funny it

524
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,760
defies reality what do you mean just

525
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,039
carbs these are fat bombs majority of

526
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,200
calories are coming from the fat and

527
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,120
combine the fat with the carb and then

528
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,880
blame the weight on the carb that's like

529
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,799
shooting the potato gun shooting that

530
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,679
Spud 300 mph across the field hitting

531
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:40,559
somebody in the head and blaming the

532
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,279
Spud and not the dude that shot him and

533
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,520
then getting off the ground dusting

534
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,039
yourself off and rubbing your head and

535
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,840
looking at the potato on the ground and

536
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:52,000
saying stupid potato all you'll ever

537
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,159
hear is the French fry as a carb not a

538
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,039
word about the oil like it doesn't exist

539
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:00,320
throw cheese on those fries and pretend

540
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,600
it doesn't exist it's all carbs there's

541
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,919
no cheese on there throw ranch or sour

542
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,200
cream on those fries or a potato and

543
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,679
pretend it doesn't exist there's no

544
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,840
Ranch on there there's no Ranch there's

545
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,640
no cheese no sour cream it just doesn't

546
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,039
exist we live in a pretend world when it

547
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,000
comes down to some of these things we

548
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,559
eat you're eating potato chips your

549
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,679
hands are smeared with grease all over

550
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,919
the place and you need a napkin to wipe

551
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,720
it you got grease all over your face

552
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,279
grease prints are on the glass of water

553
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
or something you're drinking

554
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:34,000
and you think it's a carb they tricked a

555
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,039
lot of people with that one it's the fat

556
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,399
that puts on the weight clogs up the

557
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,039
liver overburn it slows everything down

558
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,320
your liver can't store any more of it so

559
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:47,039
now the fat gathers all around your body

560
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,320
you better exercise you're told anyway

561
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,840
burn off those carbs but really you're

562
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,480
trying to burn off the fat meanwhile

563
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,360
you're on your treadmill and you're

564
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,200
thinking I got to burn off all this

565
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,080
sugar but it's the oil the but butter

566
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,559
sour cream the cheese the milk they're

567
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,399
the weight gainers I get it I get it you

568
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:07,440
know somebody who can eat whatever they

569
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:08,880
want all the cheese they want all the

570
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,720
pizza they want they don't gain any

571
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,440
weight not yet when their liver gets

572
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,080
maxed out they'll gain it down the road

573
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,559
everybody does as they get older weights

574
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,320
harder to keep off they're just lucky

575
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,760
they're not gaining it now people say

576
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,000
potatoes are a white food like processed

577
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:31,640
flour just because they have a white

578
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,720
inside but wait a minute to start with

579
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,440
an inside of a potato isn't exactly

580
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,399
white unlike processed white flour the

581
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,640
potato is a little bit of a richer color

582
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:44,200
they missed that second of all the

583
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,679
potato has a skin that skin determines

584
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,320
the color of that food just like a big

585
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,159
cultivated blueberry has a clear whitish

586
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,720
Center just like an apple has a white

587
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,640
pulp just like zucchini and yellow

588
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,640
squash has a white center zucchini is

589
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,080
green it's a green food a blueberry is

590
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,960
blue it's a blue food a red apple is red

591
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,640
it's a red food red potato is red too

592
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,799
it's a red food brown potato is a brown

593
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,440
food yellow potato is a yellow food a

594
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,200
purple potato is a purple food all these

595
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,159
simple mistakes gives us a window into

596
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,720
the possibility of what else is

597
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,799
everybody wrong about in the healthfield

598
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,520
the list is massive we haven't even

599
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,159
scratched the surface of all the

600
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,360
screw-ups the potato is a whole food not

601
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,080
a processed white food you take the

602
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,840
potato you cook it it's a whole food

603
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,679
it's a long sustaining complex

604
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,360
carbohydrate that's

605
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,000
satiating but before we talk about its

606
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,480
benefits we still got some more fish to

607
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,760
fry and some dice to roll if you heard

608
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,840
about lectins in your potato there's

609
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,480
something to know there's lectins in a

610
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,320
potato yeah just like there's lectins in

611
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,480
every single plant food there is that

612
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,919
you you eat and they're all created

613
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,679
equal unless someone spouts out an

614
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:06,840
opinion or theory that there's bad

615
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,399
lectin in a potato or tomato because

616
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,720
they're deciding they don't like those

617
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,480
and most likely because they bought into

618
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,080
an earlier theory that tomatoes and

619
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,559
potatoes cause problems cuz they're the

620
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,919
night shades oh wait you might be

621
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,360
someone that thinks well there's too

622
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:25,840
many eltin in a potato then versus

623
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,519
something else well if lectin were so

624
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,159
bad then why have so many people healed

625
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,039
eating potatoes and healed from

626
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:38,279
debilitating diseases somebody in the

627
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,880
field of Health stab the potato and use

628
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,159
lectins as the knife in the irony

629
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,799
lectins don't cause any problems they're

630
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,559
not the reason anyone has a symptom or a

631
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,440
condition on any level when you don't

632
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,559
know why people are sick we come up with

633
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,039
the most blatantly ridiculous unfounded

634
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,960
guesses we pull them straight out of our

635
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:02,279
behind and smear it on everyone

636
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,600
thousands and thousands of people healed

637
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:07,279
from debilitating diseases while eating

638
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,880
lectins and the lectin propagandists

639
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,600
pretend no one ever healed while eating

640
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,679
a tomato a potato or a lectin so what's

641
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,200
good about potato a lot let's start with

642
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:21,440
zinc it's a precious mineral that's not

643
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,760
in our food today a critical Trace

644
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,760
mineral needed to keep our immune system

645
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,760
strong and to fight pathogens there's

646
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,440
not a lot of zinc in Foods the soil

647
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,000
doesn't have zinc like it used to have

648
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,640
in the old days it's depleted so where's

649
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,600
the zinc when it comes to potato it's in

650
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,559
the skin the skin of the potato is high

651
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,519
in essential trace minerals it's a

652
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,919
protective sheath around the potato

653
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:50,000
around the pulp the trace minerals grow

654
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:53,039
into the skin the zinc helps to protect

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,120
us when we consume a potato it adds to a

656
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,080
protective shield our own immune system

657
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,600
when food science and research looks

658
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,960
into the nutritional value of a potato

659
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,480
they sample a larger portion from the

660
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,960
center of the potato and a smaller

661
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,559
portion of the skin or in many cases

662
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,000
remove the skin altoe discard it and

663
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:18,039
just test the skinless potato hey Frank

664
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,320
uh today we're testing potatoes look see

665
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:24,440
the sheet of paper it says uh you need

666
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,640
one potato peeler okay uh Frank you see

667
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,679
the potato peeler over there uh they say

668
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,880
remove the skin of the potato uh they

669
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,360
want a carbohydrate count and protein

670
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,080
count and fat count and to look for some

671
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,279
vitamins okay U just peeling the potato

672
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,200
here ow almost cut my finger with that

673
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,120
peeler um Frank what do we do with all

674
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:53,240
the Skins just throw them out meanwhile

675
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,919
the zinc is in the skin and it helps to

676
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,600
protect us zinc is an essential weapon

677
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,639
against viruses because viruses cause

678
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,919
autoimmune and much of the chronic

679
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:05,919
illness we're faced with today and the

680
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,240
zinc in a potato is not just bi aailable

681
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,279
but it's hyper absorbable which means

682
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,760
your immune cells absorb it quickly

683
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,320
instantly that matters when fighting an

684
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,360
infection that's a make or break it

685
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,799
matters if a bacteria and a wound is

686
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,399
going to spread quickly or not the zinc

687
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,919
enters cells easily because it attaches

688
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,440
to the glucose inside the potato the

689
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,399
potato has its own delivery system

690
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,080
meaning it's like ordering a pizza and

691
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,480
having it delivered to the house the

692
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,799
pizza place has its own delivery system

693
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,080
the glucose and the potato is the car

694
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,760
with the guy in it the zinc is the pizza

695
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,240
in his hand bringing it right to your

696
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,639
front door of your cells if you're

697
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,240
someone with trigeminal neuralgia jaw

698
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:52,760
pain neck pain back pain Bells paly

699
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,519
frozen shoulder fatigue burning skin

700
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:59,000
rashes migraines dizziness eye floaters

701
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,440
ringing in the years if you're someone

702
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,120
with fibromyalgia Lyme disease

703
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,720
rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis

704
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:10,600
lupus pots enal syndrome endometriosis

705
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,880
PCOS and these are just some then you're

706
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,480
dealing with viruses in the herpes

707
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:22,519
family Epstein bar shingles virus hhv6

708
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:25,000
hhv7 sedom virus simplex 1 Simplex 2 and

709
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,039
you know what's needed to battle that Li

710
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,480
scene and it helps to SL slow them down

711
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:35,080
so your immune system can help defend

712
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:38,360
you and potato has Eline so let's talk

713
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:40,399
glucose sugar the carb everything that

714
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,360
we're all complaining about sugar it's

715
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,360
got carbs it's bad it's got what is that

716
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,880
Sugar carbohydrates that's bad stuff

717
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,240
well guess what potatoes possess the

718
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,919
right kind of it the right kind of

719
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,440
carbohydrate one that's received by our

720
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,159
intestinal tract as if it was Mother's

721
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,039
Milk good bacteria our intestinal tract

722
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,960
feed off of glucose from potatoes it

723
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,960
nourishes them it keeps them strong a

724
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,799
complex carbohydrate that grows

725
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,360
underground specifically potato has a

726
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,000
correlation to good bacteria potatoes

727
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,000
never see the light they're in the earth

728
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,399
while growing and many varieties of the

729
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,120
more potent good bacteria never see the

730
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,480
light either they grow deep within our

731
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,080
gut soil born microorganisms cluster

732
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,279
around potatoes as they grow in the

733
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,399
earth these soil born microorganisms

734
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,399
feed off of natural sugars being

735
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:39,159
released from the potato skins as they

736
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,080
expand during the growing process under

737
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,799
the Earth the potatoes sweat as they

738
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,200
grow they release water during droughts

739
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,639
and dry times these soil born

740
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,200
microorganisms feed off of this drink

741
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,279
the water they have a similarity to some

742
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,039
of our good bacteria that resides in our

743
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:00,200
gut it's a food they both have a

744
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,880
connection to the glucose and potatoes

745
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,240
the sugar is critical for restoring the

746
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,839
nervous system any neurological symptom

747
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,720
and condition means the nerves are

748
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:17,879
inflamed and a need to be fueled up and

749
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,200
restored anxiety depression ticks spasms

750
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,560
aches pains these are just some

751
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,040
neurological symptoms and conditions and

752
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,159
glucose and potato is restorative so

753
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,720
let's talk about the digestive system

754
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,879
from food poisoning to colitis potatoes

755
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,159
have brought back a lot of people from

756
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,119
living hell with their suffering one of

757
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,720
my favorite tools pieces of knowledge is

758
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,599
mono eating potatoes when in difficult

759
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,839
Health

760
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,440
situations I've seen just eating

761
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:50,079
potatoes for breakfast lunch and dinner

762
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,399
along with celery juice some lemon water

763
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,079
some lettu uses here and there I've seen

764
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:00,359
it bring back people from Crohn's

765
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:04,400
colitis sibo Celiac IBS ulcers acid

766
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:07,480
reflux hives gastritis gastroparesis

767
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,040
diarrhea cramping I've seen it recover

768
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,000
people from post food poisoning where

769
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,480
nothing else would one reason is because

770
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,880
potatoes are so soothing on the

771
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,079
digestive tract and nerves especially

772
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,359
dealing with colitis where there are

773
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,800
large pockets of inflamed tissue within

774
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,520
the colon which is unknowingly caused by

775
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,520
the shingles virus knowing these medical

776
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,680
me tools has helped save a lot of people

777
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,280
with their colitis and potatoes sue the

778
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,760
lining of the colon they don't aggravate

779
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,400
the lining it's not an aggressive food

780
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,240
it's a gentle food so let's talk about a

781
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,680
few other conditions many people get

782
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,400
diagnosed with sibo these days it's

783
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,240
bacteria in the small intestinal tract

784
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,800
but what kind of bacteria that's the

785
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,440
question right there medical communities

786
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,560
they don't know it's just like you got

787
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,400
sibo overgrowth the bacteria that's

788
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,280
what's happening down there but what

789
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,560
kind it's strep to coctus that's what

790
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,400
people don't know that's a dominating

791
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,480
bacteria inside people's guts and strep

792
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:16,160
likes to eat it likes to eat all kinds

793
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:20,480
of foods cheese eggs milk butter right

794
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,000
but strep doesn't like potatoes so when

795
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,079
you eat a potato it goes down the Chute

796
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the tiny stringy fibers inside potato

797
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,960
grab on to strep bacteria and wind them

798
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,920
up balls them up and pulls them out of

799
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,359
the gut irritable bowel syndrome IBS

800
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,839
also caused by strepto coctus bacteria

801
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,440
the bacteria slowly eats away at the

802
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,440
colon lining and then tiny formations of

803
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,839
scar tissue occur potatoes are soothing

804
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,960
to the lining help feed the cells in the

805
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,400
lining wall and as it's doing that it

806
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,160
grabs onto bacteria it removes it out of

807
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,480
the colon let's talk about ulcers in the

808
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:05,359
stomach dadum small intestinal tract

809
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,240
colon ulcers are caused by bacteria and

810
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,119
viruses the canker stur virus which is a

811
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,920
herpes family virus creates ulcers the

812
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,359
lysine and potato helps to slow down and

813
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,440
stop the canker sore virus allowing the

814
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:22,480
ulcer to heal other ulcers are caused by

815
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,040
strepto octus and eoli potatoes bind on

816
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,000
to exposed bacteria as the potato moves

817
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,040
over the ulcers helping to drive the

818
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,200
bacteria out of the gut most varieties

819
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,000
of strep are antibiotic resistant or

820
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,720
partially immune to antibiotics but

821
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,480
strap and other types of bacteria cannot

822
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,319
become immune to what potato has to

823
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,560
offer have you ever had food poisoning

824
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,119
it hits you out of nowhere sometimes 12

825
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,079
to 24 hours after you've been exposed

826
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:53,920
after you've consume the food that had

827
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,040
bacteria in it or a mutated

828
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:03,640
microorganism or a food born toxin

829
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:05,599
Ow o oh my stomach hurts why is it like

830
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,520
this what did I

831
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,359
eat I had those nachos and I ordered

832
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:16,200
some fish oh my God I'm in so much pain

833
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:18,160
I I can't even talk I I'm nauseous it's

834
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,720
in the center of my gut like the pit of

835
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,680
my gut I got to get to the bathroom no I

836
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,160
need to get to the bed and lay there oh

837
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,440
I got to get to the bathroom we've all

838
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,440
been there before it's a brutal

839
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,440
experience sometimes even dangerous very

840
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,440
dangerous you have your meal hours later

841
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,040
you're feeling kind of sick and then it

842
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,480
hits you you get a little nauseous then

843
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,119
you get that terrible pain in your

844
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,839
stomach so uncomfortable could even go

845
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,200
straight to a point where you're just in

846
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,000
gnawing pain some throw up or have

847
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,839
diarrhea others have both could last a

848
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
day a week hard to get fluids down I

849
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,680
always tell people to sip coconut water

850
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,040
when coming out of a bat of food

851
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,839
poisoning but a lot of people have an

852
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,640
uneasy stomach for days after sometimes

853
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,920
a week after sometimes more than a week

854
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,880
sometimes months and any food tends to

855
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,480
not settle right or feel like it's not

856
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,760
digesting and pain gas bloating can

857
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,040
happen every day and potato on its own

858
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,480
is a powerful way to recover from post

859
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,599
food poisoning I've helped many do it

860
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,560
over the last 35 years sometimes it's

861
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,800
the only food it feels gentle enough but

862
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,040
satiating enough but gives you something

863
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,240
back so you can gain your strength

864
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,240
here's something to think about where's

865
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,880
your protein people worry about that all

866
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,319
the time what food you're eating where

867
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,079
you getting your protein every single

868
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:46,599
day potato it's not seen or viewed as a

869
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,880
food with protein in it meanwhile it

870
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,800
does have protein it's the quality of

871
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,160
protein that matters and it's

872
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,560
bioavailability the protein and potato

873
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,480
can be assimilated easy and broken down

874
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,920
easy another thing to think about is

875
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,640
trace minerals potatoes are packed with

876
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,280
them anyone that says potatoes are just

877
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,200
a ball of empty carbs void of nutrients

878
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,960
and minerals is unaware of the truth

879
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,400
potatoes grow underground they absorb

880
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,920
trace minerals potatoes are not going to

881
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,599
be considered as a superfood there's no

882
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,200
get-rich scheme with potato farming and

883
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,720
you can't fluff potatoes up and package

884
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,760
them up as a fancy new herb from the

885
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,880
Amazon or special ryome that has magical

886
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,480
powers in healing or superfood the

887
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,720
minute you say potato everybody's eyes

888
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,920
glaze over it's the ultimate food wait

889
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,200
no the ultimate taken for granted

890
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,319
healing food there's not a magical

891
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,160
special Majestic vibe that comes off a

892
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:54,520
potato nothing Sparkles when someone

893
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,920
says try some potatoes that'll help you

894
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,240
okay so the best way to eat potatoes to

895
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,000
get the best healing support from them

896
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,560
is steamed I know people love to bake

897
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,400
potatoes and fry them however you choose

898
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,760
to eat them keep them oilfree try not to

899
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,000
have them with fats don't have them with

900
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,280
chicken meat fish eggs other animal

901
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,040
products like cheese milk butter yogurt

902
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,680
cream or sour cream if you choose to eat

903
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,040
any of these Foods just don't eat potato

904
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:26,839
with them make it a potato night have it

905
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:30,000
by itself try to avoid eating coconut

906
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:32,560
oil olive oil avocado nut and Seed

907
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,839
Butters with potatoes but if you do

908
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,560
they're the best and the least
