1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
today we're talking about chemicals

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,180
we're talking about sea trails

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,180
um

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,019
we're also talking in code

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,019
major code today

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,220
big topic today

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,800
we're also in day four with day in four

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,320
day four day five which stays at six day

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,939
three we got 20 days ahead of us we're

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,260
day four of the medical medium brain

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,200
shot therapy

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,940
cleanse challenge I got brain saver here

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,940
we're gonna be talking about some sea

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,680
trails and some chemical stuff

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,100
it's going to be a really interesting

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,840
talk I hope you guys hang out for it

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,700
you see a bunch of ingredients here

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,600
because we're going to be making

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,120
the sea Trails

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,920
exposure shot

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,360
but you might be thinking I'm not

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,360
exposed to Sea Trails

23
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,260
so you think

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:12,540
but everybody is everybody is on this

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:15,799
planet is exposed to the Sea Trails I

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,299
can promise you that mark my words

27
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,680
everybody's exposed to the seashells but

28
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,420
we're talking and remember we're talking

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,420
some kind of code but we're gonna be

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,100
reading about sea trails in this brain

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,979
saver book

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,900
so we got to be you know cool about that

33
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,840
what you see right here is some lemons

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,860
you see some kale really actually nice

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,360
kale too like whoa that's really nice

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,040
kale

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,420
and then we got some asparagus right

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,799
there we got some brussels sprouts some

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,840
brussels sprouts don't look that good

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,360
because I had to peel them back and peel

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,560
them back they were like in some bad

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,479
shape

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,640
I got some chives and a little bit of

44
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,520
green onions scallions which you'll use

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,460
I got some cilantro

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,680
and I got some celery right here

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,259
so those are my ingredients I got my

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
shot glasses right here this is day four

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,860
of the medical medium brain shot therapy

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,099
cleanse challenge that's a mouthful say

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,959
that three times in a row really fast

52
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,280
anyway you guys coming on because we're

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,440
gonna be talking about some serious

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,239
chemical crap and it's gonna be really

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,680
fun so I want everybody to come on or

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
whoever's coming on because we're going

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,280
to talk about this

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,120
because I want to drop a few bombs

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,440
c h e m I'm gonna do some cheerleading

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,500
stuff right

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,300
give me a c give me an H give me an e

62
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,840
give me an m

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,400
give me a t give me an R give me an a i

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,580
l s

65
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,580
foreign

66
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,959
does AI know what does it spell

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,959
all right

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,620
stop messing around

69
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,459
we got we got some work to do okay all

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,940
right

71
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:07,260
we're here we're talking about chemicals

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,940
on the brain man chemicals

73
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,500
we're talking about some serious crap

74
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,319
and I'm not kidding about this all right

75
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,720
let me just start reading forget this

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,640
start reading I'll read anything

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,680
add a brain saver

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,819
I'm gonna just start on page 220 let's

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,819
go in there for a little bit

80
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,180
when we speak of chemicals we are

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
speaking of any kind of chemical created

82
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,920
by the chemical industry

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,260
whether we know that chemical exists

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,739
inside a product or not

85
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,239
chemical companies are Exempted for the

86
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:43,260
most part

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,080
from full disclosure in labeling

88
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,940
they have free reign in the creation and

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,040
use of their chemicals because they

90
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,260
produce so many different chemicals for

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,760
so many different Industries they got

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,099
free reign

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,099
this is just interesting in general but

94
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,959
wait do you guys hear about sea trails

95
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,959
wait do you hear about that

96
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,239
this is a fun day

97
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,900
there's no proper regulatory system

98
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,500
designed to monitor Safeguard calculate

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,180
and keep track chemicals

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,519
it would take rebuilding the entire

101
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,460
chemical industry and Beyond

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,840
so what did that just say that just said

103
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,600
that

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,840
chemical industry

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,040
worldwide has full reign

106
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,040
create whatever they want

107
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,860
without really being cataloged properly

108
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:43,080
or monitored or understood

109
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,199
thousand check this out this is really

110
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,860
cool thousands of chemicals are churned

111
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,860
out daily

112
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,880
thousands of new chemicals are churned

113
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,280
out daily by the way

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,560
so they get thrown into extremely large

115
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,979
categories instead of individually

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,100
tested for safety so so many chemicals

117
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,259
are turned out at once then instead of

118
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,380
each chemical

119
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:14,000
being tested for safety

120
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,000
they just throw them in batches

121
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,560
you can have 10 000 chemicals in one

122
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,780
category and have that category deemed

123
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,199
safe by an authority think about that

124
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,199
right there

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,340
we got to be in code today man

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,900
there's nobody talks about that stuff

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,660
but I can't help it you can have 10 000

128
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,100
chemicals in one category and have that

129
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,320
category deemed safe by an authority

130
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,780
think about this beretti ten thousand

131
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,240
individual chemicals that were never

132
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,419
tested

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,900
the effects on human nature and nature

134
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,900
nature

135
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,979
wildlife

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,020
more than 5 000 of them are

137
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,940
life-threatening in large dosages while

138
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,860
the other four thousand plus chemicals

139
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,639
may not cause immediate obvious health

140
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,220
effects within the first decade of use

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,080
yet with continual exposure will

142
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,060
contribute to diseases symptoms and

143
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,020
conditions as the years

144
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,020
tick by

145
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,880
there's such a vast array of chemicals

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,319
in production for these domestic Invader

147
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,100
products

148
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,020
thousands upon thousands of chemicals

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,319
once these chemicals enter our body

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:38,940
through our nose through our mouth

151
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,280
through our lungs right or skin

152
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,800
they can saturate any aspect of the

153
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,220
brain whether deep in the inner core of

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,900
the brain stem or

155
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,900
just in any lobe

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,500
inside the hemispheres or the cerebral

157
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,780
cortex

158
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,000
some domestic Invaders are petrochemical

159
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,800
derived when they settle into the brain

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,419
domestic Invader products often end up

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
deeper in the brain's grooves than other

162
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,819
petrochemicals domestic Invader

163
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,080
chemicals are created to have radio

164
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,940
sorry radical absorption abilities and

165
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,800
the brain is vulnerable and easy to

166
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,800
invade so I'm just talking about how our

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,120
brain can saturate get saturated by a

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,880
tremendous amount of chemicals so the

169
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,919
chemical industry creates thousands upon

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,240
thousands upon thousands of chemicals

171
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,660
constantly

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,060
but each chemical itself is never tested

173
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,060
as far as any kind of damages on

174
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,460
Wildlife or human nature

175
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,620
and but what they do is they batch the

176
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,259
chemicals so chem the chemical industry

177
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,580
batches the chemicals purposely

178
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,340
so they don't have to go through any

179
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,919
kind of regulatory system right

180
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,880
say batcho

181
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,880
I mean that's crazy

182
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,259
different chemicals do different things

183
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,940
there's no wall up that stops certain

184
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,160
chemicals from entering any part of the

185
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,180
brain they go past the blood-brain

186
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,280
barrier oh no no medical medium you

187
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,620
don't know anything about the brain

188
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,620
the blood-brain barrier stops everything

189
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,500
from going in it

190
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,419
it's a barrier medical medium I can't

191
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,639
tell you how many times I heard that

192
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,500
the blood-brain barrier it stops

193
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,819
everything bad from getting into your

194
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,259
brain

195
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,800
so you don't know anything medical

196
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,800
medium

197
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,479
this raises one of the foundational

198
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,700
problems those chemicals these chemicals

199
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,640
aren't brain tested so none of these

200
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,039
chemicals are brain tested they're not

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,020
they don't take a human being they used

202
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,279
to by the way they used to do this but

203
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,700
they didn't really look at the brand

204
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,940
back in the 1920s they used to

205
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,620
like experiment

206
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,260
on humans

207
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,480
and they would just have a ton of deadly

208
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,339
chemicals dropped on their head

209
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,060
and inhaled and on their skin and see

210
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,060
what happens then

211
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,339
Sophie Nordstrom says yet each

212
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,040
individual chemical is constantly tested

213
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:23,820
on animals in every country

214
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,800
I know that chemicals are tested on

215
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,320
animals but not each individual chemical

216
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,720
it's impossible

217
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,339
so that's something to know we're

218
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,580
talking about

219
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,580
millions of chemicals Millions created

220
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,160
each year by chemical companies chemical

221
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,980
Industries right around the world and

222
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,140
known a fraction of those very small

223
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,760
amount are tested on animals and they do

224
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,100
test on animals out there in the world

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,140
the diffraction

226
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,240
the chemical company's chemical

227
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,580
Industries are really the ones that are

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,000
testing chemicals on animals it's

229
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,240
product companies that did a lot of the

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,920
testing on animals

231
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,300
and so they don't even know from their

232
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,040
tests what's really happening in the

233
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,200
long term anyway when they do test on

234
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,660
animals

235
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,519
yes there's been a lot of tests on

236
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,740
animals and still is

237
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,540
in the industries in many of the

238
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,339
industries that aren't even chemical

239
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,260
based in their testing on animals we

240
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,200
know that right

241
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,880
horrific and horrifying all of it

242
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
this raises one of the foundational

243
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,660
problems these chemicals aren't brain

244
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
tested it's not like the chemical

245
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,279
industry knows what these chemicals can

246
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,260
do inside the human brain or how they

247
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,420
can penetrate the human brain so nobody

248
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,760
knows how these chemicals actually

249
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,279
penetrate the human brain there's no

250
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,480
Authority overlooking this either by the

251
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,360
way

252
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,740
I mean that's insane if the chemical

253
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,779
doesn't burn the hair off your arm

254
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,360
then it goes to the next stage of

255
00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,240
testing for use no one's monitoring any

256
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,700
of these chemicals entering the brain

257
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,800
with current medical tools it's not even

258
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,019
possible to monitor the full scope of

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,180
these chemicals effects on the brain we

260
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,880
can't just cut open someone's brain

261
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,860
remove a portion and look for these

262
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,240
chemicals so the industry's ultimate

263
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,220
protection is that they're creating

264
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,740
chemicals which affects the brain and

265
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,820
can't be measured or monitored so keep

266
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,100
this in mind

267
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,480
and I'm on page 221 we're just reading a

268
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,620
little bit about chemicals before we

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:32,040
move on with this topic but keep in mind

270
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,440
they can't even test on human brains you

271
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,380
can't even test on a human brain because

272
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,660
you have to cut the person's brain open

273
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,399
to look inside and even if you cut the

274
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,220
person's brain open to look inside

275
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,480
you're still not going to see the

276
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,540
chemicals

277
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,820
so this is completely experimental on

278
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,120
the planet what the chemical industry

279
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,120
does

280
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,640
meanwhile chemical industry domestic

281
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,740
Invaders can create immune system

282
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,720
weaknesses that allow brain diseases to

283
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,880
take root feed viruses and fuel the

284
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,860
creation of tumors these domestic

285
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,380
Invaders also contain traces of toxic

286
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,480
heavy metals and you know by now what

287
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,100
those can do to your brain If You're

288
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,700
Reading brain saver and brain saver

289
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,700
protocols

290
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,320
and experiment on humankind

291
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,600
it's no if you guys just got on here

292
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,779
we're talking about sea trails

293
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,180
sea Trails sea trails

294
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,320
and we're making the Sea Trail exposure

295
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,360
shot and we're day four of the medical

296
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,640
meme Branch out therapy

encounter and use these products all the

299
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,140
time there's a lot of products out there

300
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,720
that are saturated and dangerous

301
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,399
chemicals people don't even realize

302
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,240

have chosen here

319
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,959
it's no secret that we encounter and use

320
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,000
these products all the time what's

321
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,920
hidden is what their ingredients do to

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,399
us humankind is one big chemical

323
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,680
industry experiment right now

324
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,600
how many dangerous chemicals can a

325
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,519
person sop up in their lifetime before

326
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,019
it becomes apparent that it's hindering

327
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:48,000
their health and well-being and even

328
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,720
injuring them

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,820
it's almost like a joke or a prank

330
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,740
how far can the chemical industry push

331
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,660
the envelope before it's blatantly

332
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,120
obvious

333
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,720
the key to chemical industry domestic

334
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,880
Warfare is to slip every day items

335
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,980
through the door and never have the

336
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,779
finger pointed at whatever evil is

337
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,200
slipping through that door it's the

338
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:14,820
ultimate Con on humankind

339
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,240
that's incredible

340
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,620
it's unbelievable right

341
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,720
right

342
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,000
Danielle says you're the best changed my

343
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,880
life and my kids incredible

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,279
I'm so glad you're here

345
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,760
Lorena L tried the pathogen exposure

346
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,519
shot today really liked it garlic also

347
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,139
added wow

348
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,700
all right you guys we're going to move

349
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,160
on we're gonna read a little bit more I

350
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,360
want to go to the next part okay so

351
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,100
right now

352
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,100
and I am looking for the next part

353
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,940
I think uh

354
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,740
look for page two

355
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,680
come on let's get through this

356
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,079
oh yeah

357
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,860
foreign

358
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,300
so let's read a little bit here in this

359
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,860
next part you guys if you want to know

360
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,940
where I am

361
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,860
because I don't know where I am right

362
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:22,380
now where am I

363
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,420
I am in the brain saver book

364
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,860
okay we're gonna be making the sea

365
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:29,000
Trails exposure shot but I'm talking

366
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,000
about sea Trails a little bit

367
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
there are 100

368
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,639
thousands of chemicals used in our

369
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,800
Industries every day

370
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:41,339
they're put in our food

371
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,820
they're put in our cleaning supplies

372
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:47,399
they're used in every thing that's

373
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:50,100
manufactured many of these chemicals

374
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,860
are so toxic that if the human body were

375
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,839
dipped into a vat of these chemicals it

376
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,839
would be a very quick death

377
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,060
under storage containers these chemicals

378
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,760
carry the death warning

379
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,760
the death warning on these storage

380
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:16,100
containers of these chemicals

381
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,100
a skull and crossbones

382
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,760
and every single chemical that's

383
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,620
manufactured for industrial use equals

384
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,839
thousands upon thousands of gallons of

385
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,279
waste check that out every single

386
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,500
chemical and there's hundreds and

387
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,199
hundreds of thousands of them every

388
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,480
single chemical used for industrial use

389
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,699
leaves by product

390
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,100
that people have no idea to the level

391
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:44,040
what page Melvin Knight asks on YouTube

392
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:48,360
page 234

393
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,579
page 234 the paragraph starts

394
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,920
at there are hundreds of thousands of

395
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,600
chemicals used

396
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,060
in our Industries

397
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,360
so check this out every single chemical

398
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,519
that's manufactured for industrial use

399
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,620
equals this is insane thousands upon

400
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,620
thousands of gallons of waste

401
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,660
from the chemicals Inception to the

402
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,240
chemicals released in the marketplace

403
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:17,459
thousands upon thousands of byproduct

404
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,380
gallons the amount of byproduct that

405
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,600
results from perfecting that one

406
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,959
chemical far surpasses anyone's

407
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,120
imagination

408
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,280
millions of gallons can be produced of

409
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:34,040
byproduct waste as they're perfecting

410
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,040
one single chemical for industrial use

411
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,760
but you guys know where I'm going right

412
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,799
you guys know where I'm heading do you

413
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,799
guys know the inside info right here of

414
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,080
like to where I'm heading for real like

415
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,539
the inside

416
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,960
right info

417
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:54,919
you guys you guys get it right

418
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,020
in the old days Industries

419
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,679
just dumped chemical waste right into

420
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,679
rivers

421
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,419
in the old days

422
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,520
it was dumped into rivers right

423
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,140
you know that

424
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,480
the chemical industry just dumped it

425
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,740
into rivers in the old days you hear

426
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,160
what I'm going now

427
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:22,380
in the old days

428
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:25,280
mm6123 on IG they say sea Trails cause

429
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,280
Morgellons

430
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,160
they're actually

431
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,640
repeating medical medium information

432
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,559
that was put out there years ago

433
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,380
and you're repeating it back to Medical

434
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,400
medium which is always like a trip for

435
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,919
me

436
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,160
it's always I plant seeds over the

437
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,360
decades and when the seeds come back

438
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,360
it's always like a trip

439
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,299
that is soc's information

440
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,580
all right so ready

441
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,380
in the old days Industries just dumped

442
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,059
chemical waste right into rivers we know

443
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,500
that right into oceans we know that

444
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,640
right chemicals were just dumped into

445
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
oceans

446
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,120
the old days you guys hear what I'm

447
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,460
saying though the old days not today the

448
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,340
old days

449
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,919
and chemicals were dumped in and on the

450
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,360
land right in the old days in and on the

451
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,940
land

452
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,460
the chemical industry cannot dump into

453
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,179
our lakes in waterways and oceans to the

454
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,179
same degree anymore

455
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,360
by the way I put out a sea Trails

456
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,360
podcast a few years ago

457
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,679
get ready for this point right here

458
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,919
seriously

459
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,919
this is like this is on freaking

460
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,919
believable

461
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,240
in the old days all the chemicals were

462
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,179
dumped into the rivers the ocean the

463
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,039
land right and lakes

464
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,080
but the chemical industry is producing

465
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,080
more chemicals now than they ever did

466
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,299
before the chemical industry is

467
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,580
producing more than ever before in our

468
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:08,220
history

469
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,799
there's billions of more people on the

470
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,880
planet now there's that much more

471
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,880
industry now

472
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:22,080
there's that much byproduct produced by

473
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,080
all the chemical Industries

474
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:27,840
but yet it's not in the Lakes it's not

475
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:29,280
being dumped in the ocean anymore it's

476
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,860
not picked up there wouldn't be an ocean

477
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,600
left because there's that much chemical

478
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,100
created do you guys see where I'm

479
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,299
heading you guys know what I'm talking

480
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,340
about right

481
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,559
it can't be dumped in a river anymore it

482
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,600
would end the river's life if it was

483
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,100
dumped in a river it would destroy an

484
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,960
entire River now there's that much

485
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,120
chemical being produced the industry is

486
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,740
producing but in the old days there was

487
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,240
not a lot of chemical being produced in

488
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,860
the old days and it was just dumped

489
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,380
straight into rivers until finally they

490
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,640
said they knew they had to stop

491
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,700
let's see

492
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,700
the chemical industry cannot leach into

493
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,980
our land to the same degree anymore

494
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,799
with more chemicals being produced than

495
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,980
ever before where does all the chemical

496
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,220
waste go can you answer that question

497
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,740
for me can you guys answer the question

498
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,140
for me that should be the number one

499
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,840
question on the planet Earth right now

500
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,740
everybody says oh environment

501
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,220
environment environment climate climate

502
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,440
environment environment everybody's like

503
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,299
gotta save the oceans everybody's like

504
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,460
gotta save the oceans gotta Save the

505
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,620
Fish that's what everybody's saying

506
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,500
gotta save the bees the bees they're

507
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,720
gonna die the bees environment

508
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,260
the number one question that should be

509
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,260
asked

510
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,960
where does all the chemical waste go

511
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,880
if it's not being dumped inside or on

512
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,679
the land and it's not being dumped in

513
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,900
the rivers anymore and it's not being

514
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,539
dumped in the ocean anymore and it's not

515
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,880
being dumped in The Lakes anymore

516
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:05,039
but yet there's more chemical waste

517
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,780
created now than ever before in history

518
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,419
with the most chemicals made in

519
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:13,380
byproduct made ever before in history

520
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:17,480
then where does the chemical go is there

521
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,480
a genius out there that knows that

522
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,260
and by the way people that knows the

523
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,940
chemical Industries having anything to

524
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,740
do with sea Trails until a couple years

525
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,059
ago when I released the original piece

526
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,659
of information nobody knew in the

527
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,659
chemtrail world

528
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,659
try to say as fast as possible and hopes

529
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,940
that it blips by

530
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:37,940
by the way happy birthday Michelle L

531
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,960
Michelle L happy birthday because I know

532
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,700
it's your birthday today

533
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,200
it's a blessing to have you on this

534
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,039
planet it's a blessing to have you in

535
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,039
the medical immune community

536
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,860
truly

537
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,039
with more chemicals being produced than

538
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,840
ever before in history where does all

539
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,720
the chemical waste go

540
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,419
there's too much chemical byproduct and

541
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,960
no place to store it and release it

542
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:15,539
you can't store the chemical byproduct

543
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,240
the industry is producing billions of

544
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,940
gallons across the world the planet but

545
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,100
there's no place to store it they can't

546
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,260
dump it into the river so where does it

547
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,799
go

548
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,140
it can't be recycled

549
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,900
it's not like a plastic bottle you threw

550
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:39,080
in the recycle bin

551
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:41,400
and so this is the chemical industry

552
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,380
since the chemical industry cannot

553
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,260
dispose of their wasted the ways they

554
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,380
once did which was the rivers the Lakes

555
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:54,559
and the land and the ocean

556
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,559
now chemicals are being

557
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,140
I don't know they're just out there you

558
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,200
guys who want to do do you guys play

559
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:05,000
with paper planes at all

560
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,000
you guys ever make paper planes

561
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,400
anyway

562
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,490
[Laughter]

563
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,780
foreign

564
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,520
anyway

565
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,679
sea trails are composed of very top of

566
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,320
every toxin possible that the chemical

567
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,059
industry creates this includes toxic

568
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,520
heavy metals such as mercury and copper

569
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,200
it also includes old outdated Antiquated

570
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,080
chemical storage bins that have been

571
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,000
backlogged in storage for decades

572
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,640
chemical waste that has sat in tanks for

573
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,679
60 70

574
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,200
and 50 years I don't know why I want the

575
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,360
080 or even 100 years

576
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,679
It's a combination of chemicals both old

577
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,679
and new being placed in

578
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,140
[Music]

579
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,720
and dumped

580
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:54,059
it's just a theory

581
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,659
doesn't mean any of it's true I'm just

582
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,659
having fun

583
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,820
you know it's crazy right now because

584
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,080
everybody's worried about this planet

585
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,059
they're worried about the Earth they're

586
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,620
worried about the environment they're

587
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,679
worried about whatever climate they're

588
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,539
worried about all this stuff and

589
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,200
literally

590
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:20,120
one of the most diabolical situations

591
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,840
that can ever exist in in any history

592
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,539
anywhere

593
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,179
on this planet in any time frame is

594
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:29,580
happening now and it's like the craziest

595
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:34,320
thing when you think about it right so

596
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:37,020
everybody is just exposed so it's fear

597
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,000
of compassion did was because we can't

598
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:44,940
avoid this exposure it's not

599
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,400
avoidable the exposure

600
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,220
right

601
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,700
because we can't avoid it we have to

602
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,520
protect yourself so empowerment occurs

603
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,520
right it's important to empower

604
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,960
ourselves and our families and our

605
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
children and everything else

606
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,320
so

607
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:11,580
and you got like you got all the

608
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:15,240
different concerns about the environment

609
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,799
but this brain shot therapy is here to

610
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,080
help that's the whole point because we

611
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,600
can't avoid exposure it's not possible

612
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,100
unless you don't want to go outside if

613
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,740
you don't want to go outside but that's

614
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,659
the thing inside too we're exposed

615
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,779
because the air outside is the air we

616
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:32,400
breathe inside inevitably or you would

617
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,520
just

618
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,940
lose oxygen inside your home

619
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,179
wherever you live so everything that we

620
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,940
breathe in inside our home is air that's

621
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,820
coming inevitably from outside so we do

622
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,380
get we do get exposed so we're all

623
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,720
exposed

624
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,360
the entire planet is exposed right

625
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,740
everybody on the planet so it's not

626
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,740
about being afraid

627
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,260
and just so you know to make things

628
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,880
clear because there's a billion of

629
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,679
questions if you have questions you can

630
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,539
see in detail about what I'm talking

631
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,580
about in brain saver if you don't have

632
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:10,620
the brand saver book you won't have

633
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,020
those details because I can't drop all

634
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,120
the details over here

635
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,919
foreign

636
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,659
it's not the passage your commercial

637
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,220
flights you know

638
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,500
that a bunch of people are flying on

639
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,659
that's not what it is but their details

640
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,940
are in here which are really interesting

641
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,679
really interesting to know but the point

642
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,679
is is we don't have control

643
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:38,159
over like this exposure nobody does but

644
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,440
you have control to be aware and then

645
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,360
do something about it if there's

646
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,039
something available and the whole point

647
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,799
of what Spirit of compassion did was

648
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,620
Spirit compassion

649
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:53,960
want it to have something available

650
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:53,960
there was a synergistic combination

651
00:28:54,179 --> 00:29:01,919
that works just right

652
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:05,100
for overall that type of aerosol

653
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,039
right so what Spirit of compassion said

654
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,100
it takes a little bit of celery a little

655
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,380
bit of cilantro a little bit of of

656
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:15,360
chives a little bit of Brussels

657
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,220
a little bit of asparagus a little bit

658
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,539
of kale and a little bit of lemon it's

659
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:25,020
that exact chemical combination meaning

660
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:29,039
food chemical meaning phytochemical

661
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:32,640
compounds in food that exact combination

662
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,279
that has an ability to help us Purge

663
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,299
to help us Purge

664
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:42,500
a well-rounded amount of aerosol you see

665
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:46,860
the difference right there because it's

666
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:51,539
released in an aerosol fashion

667
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:53,419
so it takes a certain combination to

668
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,760
help with this

669
00:29:53,419 --> 00:30:00,480
to actually help the body Purge

670
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,460
chemical warfare that's in an aerosol

671
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,520
form

672
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,020
so Spirit of compassion wanted to offer

673
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,659
something because

674
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,059
there's there's nothing we can do about

675
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,580
the exposure there's nothing anybody's

676
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:16,260
going to do about the exposure

677
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,080
it's just

678
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,120
the way it works

679
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,460
but we can do something to empower

680
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,940
ourselves and protect ourselves very

681
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,940
interesting

682
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,860
we live in a world where we're being

683
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,500
taught to Fear the Future of our climate

684
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,260
at the same time there's a terrifying

685
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,799
reality that's being ignored

686
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,080
which is the unprecedented high level of

687
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,360
dangerous chemical contamination and

688
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:50,360
saturation being released

689
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,360
within our sight onto our children

690
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,039
I can't keep on reading too much of this

691
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:00,779
though there's too many hot spots in it

692
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:02,279
let's just figure this out we'll do some

693
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,960
other stuff we'll actually do the shot

694
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,220
and everything else I'm excited let me

695
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,260
see if there's something else I can try

696
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,919
to I'm trying to pick and choose what I

697
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,919
could read out here

698
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,340
oh here's the part that's really cool

699
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,380
an IG

700
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,899
clean up your diet that's your handle

701
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,960
that's cool I've heard people saying it

702
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:23,820
would cost a fortune the fly planes just

703
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,799
to dump that how should I respond to

704
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,799
that

705
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,440
you gotta definitely read

706
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,760
this because I talk about how that

707
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,760
happens and why and all that

708
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,240
and just so you know

709
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,200
it's easy and can be done

710
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,580
did you ever hear about thousands of

711
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,899
birds falling out of the sky you guys

712
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,340
ever hear that with thousands of birds

713
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,000
are falling in this guy like thousands

714
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,580
like ten thousands an entire migration

715
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,740
down on the ground right

716
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,740
that's from a migration of birds

717
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:06,539
I know it's not like you know it would

718
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,399
be migration sparrows or migration right

719
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,399
Robin's a migration of like

720
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,640
so that's from a migration of birds

721
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,640
running into a very thick patch

722
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,080
so that's from a migration of birds

723
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,840
running

724
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,840
from a very thick Pack patch right

725
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,960
butter

726
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,520
being poisoned in the sky and falling to

727
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,039
their death it happens all over the

728
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,159
planet in places you can't see we only

729
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,740
recognize it when it happens you guys

730
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,899
we only recognize it

731
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,380
when it happens in it where it's in a

732
00:32:54,899 --> 00:33:01,919
visible place like in a city a village a

733
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,220
town on the streets in the Town Center

734
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,919
you don't see it when the patch they the

735
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,860
birds hit happens in the woods somewhere

736
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,860
in the mountains just so so much wastage

737
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,760
Spirit of compassion told me that there

738
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,299
isn't going to be Birds someday and this

739
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,299
is the reason

740
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,880
check this out right

741
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:30,179
algae blooms and chemical clusters in

742
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,640
oceans and lakes are from

743
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:34,559
that as well

744
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,480
causing schools of choked out fish and

745
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,460
other sea life to wash up on the shore

746
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,880
and people don't realize it it's from

747
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,880
that

748
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,600
I don't know I just thought it was a fun

749
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,019
topic that's all to talk about

750
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,860
and I thought I would put the Sea Trail

751
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,659
exposure shot into the mix of the 20 day

752
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,880
um brain shot therapy cleanse challenge

753
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:03,080
because we're so exposed so I just

754
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,080
thought it would be a great idea

755
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,919
but they'll just tell you it's all your

756
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,300
genes and your body attacking itself is

757
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,220
what they'll tell you out there like

758
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,740
it's all your genes and maybe it's all

759
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,659
the birds genes too

760
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,740
millions and millions of birds falling

761
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,659
to their death

762
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,659
it's all the birds genes now right

763
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,780
sorry let's

764
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,060
let's get into it

765
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,859
it's not the pathogens and toxins it's

766
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,659
not the pathogens going around and the

767
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:33,859
toxins that we're up against no it's not

768
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,859
that it's our genes

769
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,859
but the part I think that bugs me the

770
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,780
most

771
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,700
I think one of the parts that like

772
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,560
really gets on my nerves like the most

773
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,300
when I really think about it

774
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,399
is

775
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,899
the fact that

776
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,899
we know what's happening

777
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,820
and everybody who has power in the world

778
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,680
knows it's happening

779
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,680
but it just keeps on happening

780
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,820
but yet we're supposed to worry about

781
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,660
other things

782
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,760
right Sarah says doesn't the Bible talk

783
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,480
about the ocean turning red yes it does

784
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,480
indeed

785
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,320
yeah and the red tide

786
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,079
all right come on let's lighten it up

787
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,660
let's move on let's make the shot

788
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,280
lighten things up a little bit

789
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,420
so what we're doing is we're protecting

790
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,540
our brain

791
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:38,520
from these chemicals now you don't have

792
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,440
to do this shot every single day but

793
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,540
it's a great shot to do periodically

794
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,880
like I'll do it for a couple of days

795
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,500
then I'll wait after a while do it for

796
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,020
another couple of days it's just an

797
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,660
incredible option

798
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,940
listen

799
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,060
I don't want anybody to be like worried

800
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:00,480
or upset right because we have the tools

801
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:03,119
and we have the power in our own lives

802
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,460
we can take care of ourselves right we

803
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,320
can do things we can we can get medals

804
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,440
out we can do heavy metal detox

805
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,079
protocols right we can do incredible

806
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,940
tools we can do celery juice we have so

807
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,839
many options to take care of ourselves

808
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,180
and clean it up in our own bodies and

809
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,560
own minds and that's the incredible part

810
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,599
about it all

811
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,160
and I didn't even talk about the scary

812
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,060
stuff about it so I hope people aren't

813
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,300
upset

814
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:33,300
if you want the scary stuff

815
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,880
read the brain saver book

816
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,720
or go to Medical medium podcast to Apple

817
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:43,339
podcast and listen to the episode the

818
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,339
episode was a couple of years ago

819
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,940
okay so I really like this shot

820
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,619
I'm not a big fan of the taste of the

821
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,480
shot the taste of the shots not so bad

822
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,640
some of these shots they're hard to get

823
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,520
down because they're not designed for

824
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,500
flavors they're not designed for your

825
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,119
flavor palette they're not designed for

826
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,119
that that's not what it's about right

827
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,099
honestly I wouldn't you know what if you

828
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,180
have air fresheners pumping in your

829
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,000
house

830
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:18,000
that can be worse because it's directly

831
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,800
directly in your face every second so

832
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,660
what I recommend if you want to be

833
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,000
empowered on any of the chemical warfare

834
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,099
you take out your air fresheners and you

835
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,560
throw them out you pull them out of the

836
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,320
walls and get them from under the sinks

837
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,780
and you throw them out first things

838
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,119
first is the air fresheners that is one

839
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,940
of the domestic chemical warfares of our

840
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:40,740
time right the other thing is right you

841
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:44,099
gotta be careful about cleaning products

842
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:47,040
another thing too is detergents

843
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,140
right with all those scented stuff all

844
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,240
the fragrances all the scents I've been

845
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,280
telling talking about this for years I

846
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,260
remember three years ago three and a

847
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,420
half years ago I think it almost four

848
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:00,060
years ago now I was talking about how

849
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,280
bad perfume colognes air fresheners and

850
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,740
scented candles were and then then

851
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,940
literally a bunch of people try to

852
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,380
cancel me

853
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,140
because

854
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,520
they thought it was the stupidest thing

855
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,920
to be talking about when there was

856
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,260
something else going on in the world and

857
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,859
they were like why is this guy talking

858
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,780
about air fresheners and scented candles

859
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:23,460
and they were trying to like rip me down

860
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,320
over that and I'm still gonna talk about

861
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,760
it and now you hear people talking about

862
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,859
it now you'll see an influence out there

863
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,359
yeah don't don't work don't do the

864
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,500
fragrances oh where did you get that

865
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,599
info

866
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,240
when you stop using a lot of the super

867
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,680
toxic chemical products right and you

868
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,300
stop buying those chemicals with all

869
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,260
those fragrances that they're selling

870
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,200
out there

871
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:47,579
they produce less of them

872
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,140
so yes the power is in our hands to stop

873
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,780
the industry

874
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,660
from possibly creating more chemicals

875
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,720
The Big Industry Giants in the world on

876
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,400
the planet so it's true you know that's

877
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,740
one way that could really hurt the

878
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,099
chemical industry if people

879
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,500
stop buying everything

880
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,859
that sent it like that air fresheners

881
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,020
fragrances chemicals perfumes clones all

882
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:14,880
that stuff has stuff in it bad chemicals

883
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,339
right and because of that they'll

884
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,660
produce less

885
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:20,579
but the air fresheners and their

886
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,740
fragrances the bad chemical stuff has

887
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,599
gotten so much more toxic than it ever

888
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,480
was before 10 years ago and ever was

889
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,300
before 20 years ago so we're up against

890
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,800
chemicals now that are so toxic in all

891
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,839
the fragrances it's like nothing

892
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,000
anybody's ever seen so the chemical

893
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,940
industry is creating fragrances that are

894
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,800
so horrific at this point and yeah

895
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,599
people stop using them and stop

896
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,619
purchasing them you better believe they

897
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,619
don't produce them anymore

898
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:52,500
they're creating chemical sense and

899
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,960
fragrances that actually stick around

900
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,780
forever

901
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,180
A Thousand Years could go by in a home

902
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:03,540
that's been doused

903
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,640
by a tremendous amount of fragrance

904
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,560
if it preserved a thousand years later

905
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,940
and they opened up that home A Thousand

906
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,099
Years Later you would smell that

907
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,440
chemical

908
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,920
you're creating chemicals that won't go

909
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,020
away but what you can do is you can stop

910
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,780
taking in the new stuff like you can

911
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,760
pull it out of your walls throw out the

912
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,440
candles that are scented get it out so

913
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,460
you're not constantly bringing more and

914
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,040
more more

915
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,619
meanwhile the scream about climate

916
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,460
change meanwhile no one's talking about

917
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:34,460
fragrances

918
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,460
chemical Industries producing trillions

919
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:43,440
of gallons of wasted chemicals that are

920
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,420
just waste

921
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,859
they're not talking about dryer sheets

922
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,720
they're not talking about any of that

923
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:51,619
they're not talking about sea trails

924
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,619
should not talk about nothing

925
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,220
all right let's make the shot

926
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:04,140
Muhammad said guys listen to me I have

927
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,839
followed the medical medium diet and I

928
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,060
am healing from Vitiligo it works it

929
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:10,920
really does what I what I really love

930
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,900
about the medical medium information for

931
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,859
Vitiligo is it's the only information

932
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:20,900
that's how Vitiligo in anyone

933
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:20,900
for years and years and years now

934
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,920
don't worry the media the media won't

935
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,200
cover that the media won't talk about

936
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,540
reversing a Vitiligo with medical medium

937
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,339
information which is like a miracle they

938
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,960
won't cover that but instead they'll

939
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:36,900
just do hip pieces after hit pieces

940
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,839
whatever or some other smack will be

941
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,180
talked about me but yet Vitiligo can't

942
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,980
be healed they can't be healed out there

943
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,099
but yet it can

944
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,099
like mm info is reversing it in so many

945
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,560
people like I I see it out there

946
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,160
it's really special

947
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,339
God bless you by the way

948
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,339
all right

949
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,180
I'm gonna put some kale in here quarter

950
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,560
cup of tightly packed kale

951
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,359
but I just want to talk about it it

952
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,680
starts with frozen wild blueberries I

953
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,900
don't have Frozen wild blueberries today

954
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,880
so I have wild blueberry juice today is

955
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,680
what I have so I'm gonna use that so you

956
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,839
can have the option of using different

957
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,540
wild blueberry

958
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,820
um you know sources so I'm just saying

959
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,880
put wild blueberries the key for this

960
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,240
one a regular blueberry won't do it so a

961
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,020
regular regular confident blueberry does

962
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:34,320
not have enough anthocyanin to or

963
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,300
phytochemical compounds to mix in with

964
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,359
all these others to make something

965
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,220
happen Nano chemicals are really really

966
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,079
tiny these are Nano chemicals we're

967
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,980
talking about septo chemicals the acto

968
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,200
chemicals they're so tiny it's insane

969
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,400
that's what kind of chemicals we're even

970
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,560
talking about

971
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,540
so yeah so wild blueberries the one of

972
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,880
choice not the cultivated blueberry with

973
00:42:54,540 --> 00:43:00,060
the big the big bluebird

974
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,880
Brett Winters where does the nanotech in

975
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:05,400
the sky come from

976
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,800
Fred wouldn't you did you just come in

977
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,780
we're talking about it

978
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,579
oh maybe you're saying where does it you

979
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,079
know where it comes from up in the sky

980
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,700
you're wondering where it comes from

981
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,040
it's chemicals

982
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,500
right and byproduct for the waste I was

983
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,660
talking about from the industries

984
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,579
if that was your question all right so

985
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,200
on the wild blueberry front that's

986
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:28,500
that's key but I'm gonna add the wild

987
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,880
blueberry juice after right but if you

988
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,619
have your wild blueberries like frozen

989
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,000
wild boobers you can use that now and

990
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:35,339
dump them in the first so I'm giving you

991
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,859
a chance to do that

992
00:43:35,339 --> 00:43:39,480
the next one would be kale so a quarter

993
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:42,380
cup technically packed kale so I'm gonna

994
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,380
drop some kale in here

995
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:48,079
nice

996
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,579
it's not a quarter cup though

997
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,339
if that was tightly packed that would

998
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,200
that would definitely be probably a

999
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,579
little over a quarter cup on that one

1000
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,119
right there but yeah

1001
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:07,980
quarter lemon peel let me get a lemon

1002
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,099
I get a lemon right here first of all

1003
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,140
I'm gonna peel it back if you don't mind

1004
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,900
I was supposed to probably do that

1005
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,700
earlier but

1006
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,099
so I'm peeling the lemon you don't have

1007
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,839
to peel it perfectly but this is the

1008
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:24,780
next thing by the way this is the MN

1009
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,460
1500 it's on sale right now the mm-900

1010
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,040
is on sale too you guys know I work with

1011
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,619
the magnets incredible products

1012
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,420
I call them the medicine machine they

1013
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,400
save people money because they squeeze

1014
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,700
more juice out of stuff

1015
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,920
and they can handle real juicing

1016
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,079
medical medium Community juices like no

1017
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,480
other community in the world like it's

1018
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,319
it's unbelievable

1019
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,319
to the degree

1020
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:52,220
quarter lemon going down in there

1021
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,780
half cup tightly packed cilantro

1022
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:02,000
everybody

1023
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,000
half cup tightly packed cilantro

1024
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,280
let's get that in there

1025
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,040
tightly packed that's going to do it

1026
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,040
there that's incredible

1027
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:28,680
quarter cup tightly packed chives I got

1028
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,520
scallions and chives right here you can

1029
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,520
use either or

1030
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:36,540
if you have chives just use chives but

1031
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,700
I'm using a combination so I can show

1032
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,140
you guys in case you guys are like maybe

1033
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,640
someone's freaking out they're like I

1034
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:46,819
don't have chives I only have scallions

1035
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,819
foreign

1036
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,800
brussels sprouts now these brussels

1037
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,500
sprouts are so tiny I had to peel them

1038
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,780
back so I'm probably gonna put four in

1039
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,680
here

1040
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:07,680
because

1041
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,720
they really equal four or five of these

1042
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,720
will equal two good sized ones right

1043
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,180
there we go

1044
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,460
this has a high compression which is

1045
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,560
incredible this stuff is coming out dry

1046
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,480
that's what you want with the juicer and

1047
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,560
then the mn1500 does that

1048
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,619
in 900. two raw medium stocks

1049
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,200
of asparagus send you on through these

1050
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,300
are little ones so I'm gonna add

1051
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,040
I mean these are really small

1052
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,180
these are Spears

1053
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,180
you can call them Spears

1054
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,440
I'm gonna add those in

1055
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,339
half a stalk of celery is next

1056
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,240
we'll use this this is actually a short

1057
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,240
one and it's kind of tight and broken

1058
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,680
it's a celery stalk

1059
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,680
here we go

1060
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,220
that's my shot right there

1061
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,119
amazing

1062
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,119
I'm excited

1063
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm letting it just trickle out a little

1064
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,380
bit more

1065
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,819
and then I'm adding a little bit of

1066
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,440
blueberry juice in the end of mine

1067
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:24,060
because you might have added the wild

1068
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,119
blueberries the Frozen wild blueberry

1069
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:30,800
ones right beforehand

1070
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm adding a little after

1071
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,040
incredible

1072
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:40,220
I got a little screen here let's not

1073
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,220
knock over the blueberry juice

1074
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,700
amazing

1075
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,040
okay then I'm gonna add a little bit of

1076
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,940
blueberry juice to here too

1077
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,940
just a little bit

1078
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,319
that is the chemtrail exposure shot

1079
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,319
right there

1080
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,020
okay

1081
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,700
the music we didn't do a half time

1082
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,400
what was I thinking

1083
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,500
maybe we could do the robot down

1084
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,819
half time

1085
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,940
this is it you have your shot did you do

1086
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:34,619
yours already

1087
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:37,920
[Music]

1088
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:39,420
what's incredible about this okay is

1089
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,099
that no one would know that it's a

1090
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,500
combination of phytochemical compounds

1091
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:46,079
that are grown on this Earth we have

1092
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,660
medicine now think about this

1093
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,359
please think about this one point from

1094
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:54,020
Spirit of compassion if we have the

1095
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:57,720
ability to create chemical warfare

1096
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:59,760
domestic chemical warfare chemicals from

1097
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,460
the chemical industry on this planet

1098
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,859
that destroys life and the environment

1099
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,579
in which we live it if we have that

1100
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:10,859
ability as human beings to create

1101
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:14,160
dangerous concoctions of chemicals then

1102
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:16,500
surely if it comes from this planet that

1103
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,660
means the chemicals that are dangerous

1104
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,300
and lethal and problematic if they come

1105
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:23,099
from this planet then surely we have

1106
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,119
something from this planet that can help

1107
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,940
us

1108
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:31,980
and it's the food that's grown on this

1109
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:34,500
planet has mystery mystery

1110
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,060
powers

1111
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,819
to help us

1112
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,980
phytochemical compounds

1113
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,920
when they're mixed together

1114
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,300
just like chemicals dangerous chemicals

1115
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,579
in science

1116
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,920
have an effect

1117
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:51,240
and so in food when these phytochemical

1118
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,680
compounds

1119
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:58,500
are actually mingling with each other

1120
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,119
they ignite and something occurs fear of

1121
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,760
compassion

say about them is the fact that they do

1206
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:10,800
that and they make them affordable for

1207
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,780
