[188.04 - 191.36] it was around 7 8 years old somewhere
[189.52 - 193.00] around there 7 8 n years old in that
[191.36 - 195.20] realm I had a couple of you know couple
[193.00 - 198.20] of things hit me and one was why should
[195.20 - 201.28] I care why should I care about anybody
[198.20 - 202.88] why should I even care why bother you
[201.28 - 204.36] know that's that's what was hitting me
[202.88 - 206.32] and I was telling spirit because I was
[204.36 - 208.32] already talking to Spirit since Age 4
[206.32 - 211.40] and I was saying to Spirit why do I have
[208.32 - 213.20] to care who car cares about everybody
[211.40 - 215.76] being sick or what's wrong with them or
[213.20 - 220.40] what's going on why do I even need to
[215.76 - 222.44] care you know and and I'm 8 years old
[220.40 - 226.44] what does it matter and spirit said you
[222.44 - 229.72] have to care you have to know that now
[226.44 - 231.24] you have to care about others and what
[229.72 - 232.88] they're going through and what's
[231.24 - 234.20] happening in their lives and what
[232.88 - 236.12] they're suffering from and what they're
[234.20 - 239.68] struggling from what they've been
[236.12 - 242.52] through you have to care it matters
[239.68 - 244.92] matters it matters the work you do down
[242.52 - 247.44] here matters and you have to care and I
[244.92 - 250.60] clicked on the care button I said all
[247.44 - 252.32] right I said okay I clicked it on I
[250.60 - 254.56] clicked it on I mean it was there
[252.32 - 256.48] already but I was getting IR irritable
[254.56 - 258.44] because I was a child that was hearing a
[256.48 - 260.92] voice perfectly clear which was spirit
[258.44 - 262.72] and spirit was telling me everything and
[260.92 - 264.76] it was really hard to deal with so and
[262.72 - 267.40] it seeing every every illness in people
[264.76 - 268.72] and you name it and you know seeing
[267.40 - 269.92] people that have brain tumors seeing
[268.72 - 271.32] people that have all kinds of different
[269.92 - 272.72] problems it was you know always coming
[271.32 - 275.64] through people that had cancer it was
[272.72 - 277.36] always coming through and and I was like
[275.64 - 279.96] you know what I I I don't want to care
[277.36 - 282.92] anymore this is just too much and spirit
[279.96 - 285.32] said you have to care and so when it
[282.92 - 288.16] comes down to the unforgiving for which
[285.32 - 291.44] we're talking about today you
[288.16 - 294.84] guys it's important to know what is in
[291.44 - 297.36] our way what is in your way what is in
[294.84 - 300.12] your way of healing okay and what's in
[297.36 - 301.56] all of our ways of healing like in in
[300.12 - 305.32] the way and so we're going to talk about
[301.56 - 306.84] all that um hey you know um go to
[305.32 - 308.32] Medical medium.com if you ever get a

[318.52 - 321.36] so if you get a chance get down there
[319.88 - 323.24] we're doing the light blast it's when
[321.36 - 324.68] Spirit sends light literally from heaven
[323.24 - 326.16] right on down on the crown of
[324.68 - 329.16] everybody's head and it rushes through
[326.16 - 331.84] their body and it's a rush it's a rush
[329.16 - 335.96] and I say right after it after the light
[331.84 - 338.96] blast I say no operating heavy machinery
[335.96 - 341.28] for a few minutes after that light blast
[338.96 - 343.48] because it is really intense it's there
[341.28 - 345.76] to ignite the healing process to lift
[343.48 - 348.00] people up to ignite the healing process
[345.76 - 349.88] what it does is it that light rushes
[348.00 - 352.44] through the body and builds up the
[349.88 - 354.76] immune system it builds up the immune
[352.44 - 358.32] system the lymphocytes the basophils the
[354.76 - 360.36] monocytes the neutrophils the platelets
[358.32 - 361.80] it just goes through the body and it
[360.36 - 363.64] starts to get rid of any kind of
[361.80 - 366.80] Darkness any kind of bugs in people's
[363.64 - 369.44] bodies and toxins and it helps to ignite
[366.80 - 371.12] the it's the ignition of healing and

[543.32 - 547.76] thing and so stay tuned it started with
[545.84 - 549.44] a gift at ag4 for me I diagnosed my
[547.76 - 551.00] grandmother of lung cancer and spirit I
[549.44 - 552.28] heard spirit for the first time I woke
[551.00 - 555.08] up that morning and heard Spirit
[552.28 - 556.40] perfectly clear in my ear and I've been
[555.08 - 559.28] doing this ever
[556.40 - 561.96] since so anyway look and as I've always
[559.28 - 565.32] said before we don't have 10 or 20 or 30
[561.96 - 568.40] years to wait for answers so let's start
[565.32 - 571.08] the healing now let's learn how to
[568.40 - 574.56] protect our ourselves from the
[571.08 - 577.40] unforgiving four yeah you heard me the
[574.56 - 581.36] unforgiving four so we're on it so what
[577.40 - 584.32] is what is this the unforgiving for what
[581.36 - 586.96] what am I talking about I mean some of
[584.32 - 589.24] you might know already I've hinted I've
[586.96 - 591.40] talked about it you know I've said
[589.24 - 593.16] something about it I think I've even put
[591.40 - 596.16] some stuff about out there maybe in the
[593.16 - 598.20] newsletter or something so you know you
[596.16 - 600.88] Pro some of you probably gotten you know
[598.20 - 603.76] that but you know a lot of you may not
[600.88 - 607.84] have heard about the unforgiving for the
[603.76 - 612.80] unforgiving for is what Spirit calls
[607.84 - 614.68] this group of things that get in our way
[612.80 - 619.68] they interfere with our
[614.68 - 622.40] lives they poison us they poison us they
[619.68 - 626.48] inhibit us from healing they stop us
[622.40 - 629.12] from healing or try to and they wreak
[626.48 - 630.84] havoc and they're basically a threat
[629.12 - 632.40] they basically a deception a threat a
[630.84 - 636.12] deceptive threat you know you know
[632.40 - 640.44] here's the deal you know when we grow up
[636.12 - 643.00] when we grow up it's all about you know
[640.44 - 645.24] it's all about safety when we're a child
[643.00 - 646.44] it's all about safety your parents hold
[645.24 - 647.72] your hand I talked about this before
[646.44 - 650.00] they hold your hand before you cross the
[647.72 - 652.52] street right I mean that's that's the
[650.00 - 654.36] that's the goal in school there's these
[652.52 - 657.32] different monitors in school they look
[654.36 - 658.76] after you there's playground monitors
[657.32 - 660.40] there's you know or whatever there's
[658.76 - 662.56] just you know and now there's security
[660.40 - 664.96] in schools and when you start getting
[662.56 - 666.56] older and then you get insurance you
[664.96 - 667.96] know you get car insurance you get all
[666.56 - 669.92] the differ insurances you're always
[667.96 - 673.24] trying to protect yourself you're always
[669.92 - 677.84] doing all these things it's all about
[673.24 - 680.64] protection on so many levels we
[677.84 - 681.68] inherently talk about and we know about
[680.64 - 684.56] in our
[681.68 - 688.12] lives but what about and these are all
[684.56 - 692.24] things we can see protecting ourselves
[688.12 - 694.00] from any thing we can see so if a bus is
[692.24 - 696.72] going down the road and we don't want to
[694.00 - 700.88] get in the way of it we move
[696.72 - 703.28] away okay or or our our parent or
[700.88 - 706.12] Guardian pulls us away from that bus so
[703.28 - 708.68] we don't get hit all
[706.12 - 710.28] right or you know angels are trying to
[708.68 - 713.00] protect us all the time too and they
[710.28 - 714.76] might even if they have a chance can
[713.00 - 717.44] pull us away from a
[714.76 - 721.12] tragedy but it's always things we can
[717.44 - 723.28] see you can see see it all you know you
[721.12 - 724.80] got to be careful you got to be careful
[723.28 - 727.24] if you're going swimming that you're not
[724.80 - 731.12] in a in a you know too rough of a water
[727.24 - 735.36] patch or Too Deep whatever it is it's
[731.12 - 738.20] things we can see no matter what but
[735.36 - 740.44] what about the things you can't see what
[738.20 - 744.52] about the things we don't hear about
[740.44 - 748.36] talk about much because or talk about it
[744.52 - 750.44] all because you can't see it what about
[748.36 - 752.72] those things
[750.44 - 755.40] well they exist and that's what we're
[752.72 - 757.32] covering that's what we're covering
[755.40 - 759.12] because it's all about what you see in
[757.32 - 762.20] this world it's all about got to see it
[759.12 - 764.80] to believe it got to see
[762.20 - 766.12] it got to see it to believe it you know
[764.80 - 768.40] I'm not going to believe it unless I see
[766.12 - 771.20] it right it's all about it's all
[768.40 - 773.32] about it's all about what you can see
[771.20 - 776.96] I'll see it if I I'll believe it if I
[773.32 - 778.36] see it right is that what happens well
[776.96 - 780.56] what you know there's a funny thing it
[778.36 - 783.44] just reminds at me that's what happens
[780.56 - 785.52] when people come to the event and they
[783.44 - 787.84] never seen what I've done before what
[785.52 - 790.00] Spirit does before I can't take any
[787.84 - 791.44] credit for it that's what Spirit does
[790.00 - 793.12] I've learned my lesson I tried to take
[791.44 - 795.08] credit for it years ago you heard the
[793.12 - 796.76] story you heard the story many times I
[795.08 - 799.32] even told a story in my book in a
[796.76 - 801.68] medical medium book the first book and
[799.32 - 803.92] um you know I can't take any of the
[801.68 - 806.52] credit I've learned my lesson I've
[803.92 - 810.16] learned it well but you know when when
[806.52 - 813.72] people go to the live event and and they
[810.16 - 816.44] see me do my work on the stage where
[813.72 - 818.84] Spirit or our work spirit and I our work
[816.44 - 820.60] where spirit's telling me what's going
[818.84 - 822.04] on with each person and what's wrong
[820.60 - 824.96] with them and what's inside what kind of
[822.04 - 826.60] illness they're dealing with you name it
[824.96 - 828.12] and spirit's doing it for me and I'm
[826.60 - 829.72] doing that and then people who have gone
[828.12 - 831.12] there that maybe never seen or heard
[829.72 - 832.44] about this but they go they they hear
[831.12 - 836.00] about the event and they
[832.44 - 837.84] come and they walk out and they're like
[836.00 - 839.96] I don't know how he did that I don't
[837.84 - 843.20] know how it was possible possible but
[839.96 - 844.88] yes I I believe it because I've seen it
[843.20 - 847.72] and so that's the kind of world we live
[844.88 - 849.16] in and and that's fine there's nothing
[847.72 - 852.84] wrong with that because we we like to
[849.16 - 855.28] see things in order to believe them and
[852.84 - 858.16] and the problem is with mystery illness
[855.28 - 862.84] you guys with mystery illness the
[858.16 - 866.88] problem is is that we can't see
[862.84 - 868.92] it we can't see it so when you're sick
[866.88 - 871.56] you get told hey you know you're fine
[868.92 - 873.80] you look fine yeah you're laying in your
[871.56 - 875.92] bed you're catatonic but you look fine
[873.80 - 877.96] and you're probably making it up because
[875.92 - 880.56] we can't see it the doctor can't see it
[877.96 - 883.96] on the blood test no one can see it no
[880.56 - 886.80] one cares because they can't see it so
[883.96 - 890.52] um you just go off on your Merry way
[886.80 - 892.28] Faker you faker right that's who I've
[890.52 - 894.88] heard people tell me they've been called
[892.28 - 896.44] fakers oh that makes me so upset that's
[894.88 - 898.76] why I got to laugh about it because if I
[896.44 - 900.68] don't I'm going to just be so you know
[898.76 - 903.56] disheartened by it and it's saddened by
[900.68 - 906.08] it and and I'm already it's already
[903.56 - 909.36] saddening as it is because when I hear
[906.08 - 912.84] it I get like welled up in inside and I
[909.36 - 916.56] get emotional about it because it breaks
[912.84 - 919.20] my heart if someone's called a faker
[916.56 - 920.64] when they're really sick and the world's
[919.20 - 923.72] getting a little better we're getting
[920.64 - 925.36] we're finally getting to a place you
[923.72 - 928.00] know the internet and a lot of
[925.36 - 929.84] practitioners are are you know are
[928.00 - 931.44] looking out
[929.84 - 933.16] practitioners are are looking out for
[931.44 - 934.44] people more and all these different
[933.16 - 935.68] things are happening we're finally
[934.44 - 940.04] getting to a
[935.68 - 943.88] point where you know we're not told
[940.04 - 945.96] we're faking it anymore in many aspects
[943.88 - 947.84] of medicine but that's not entirely true
[945.96 - 950.68] because there's still there's still some
[947.84 - 952.68] leftovers um and you know and that's the
[950.68 - 955.68] whole thing the process of of Planet
[952.68 - 957.16] stress is you know it just if someone
[955.68 - 959.36] doesn't experience it themselves they
[957.16 - 961.72] think it doesn't exist
[959.36 - 964.48] if they don't experience it themselves
[961.72 - 968.16] they think it doesn't exist that's
[964.48 - 970.04] planet Earth that's planet Earth here on
[968.16 - 971.60] planet Earth I'm sorry to say and I'm
[970.04 - 974.64] sure you know and you sure you lived it
[971.60 - 977.84] I sure you seen it I'm sure you name
[974.64 - 980.84] it if someone doesn't see it then they
[977.84 - 983.96] don't believe it you get called a faker
[980.84 - 985.56] cuz you're sick um you know mommies that
[983.96 - 987.36] can't get out of bed and take care of
[985.56 - 989.36] their kids there you know they can't
[987.36 - 991.48] find anything on the test
[989.36 - 993.68] and then the problem is is even if they
[991.48 - 995.32] go to a good doctor and the doctor says
[993.68 - 996.52] yeah you're sick so they get validated
[995.32 - 999.04] they get validated with the wrong
[996.52 - 1000.72] illness in the wrong direction that's
[999.04 - 1002.16] still happening and we're trying to
[1000.72 - 1003.08] change that at the medical Medium show
[1002.16 - 1006.00] and the books and everything we're
[1003.08 - 1008.76] trying to change that so but the bottom
[1006.00 - 1011.24] line is it's a see it to believe it
[1008.76 - 1015.04] world right
[1011.24 - 1019.64] so if there's this unforgiving
[1015.04 - 1020.88] for no one sees it then who's going to
[1019.64 - 1024.72] believe
[1020.88 - 1026.68] it and then we just get these different
[1024.72 - 1028.64] tags and labels and I want to go I want
[1026.68 - 1031.68] to go over a couple of things I've done
[1028.64 - 1034.28] this before but it applies here so much
[1031.68 - 1035.88] that I can't not do it and just ignore
[1034.28 - 1039.12] it but
[1035.88 - 1040.96] autoimmune autoimmune being told we have
[1039.12 - 1042.24] autoimmune because medical research and
[1040.96 - 1044.56] medical science doesn't know what's
[1042.24 - 1045.68] causing your symptoms or your illness is
[1044.56 - 1047.84] a
[1045.68 - 1049.40] tragedy telling us that our body's
[1047.84 - 1050.68] attacking and this is the first time you
[1049.40 - 1052.64] logged on to this you don't know
[1050.68 - 1054.64] anything about me you better believe it
[1052.64 - 1056.44] you better know right now and I'm just
[1054.64 - 1058.60] saying this for your own health and
[1056.44 - 1061.56] wellbeing and your friends and your
[1058.60 - 1064.12] families your body doesn't attack itself
[1061.56 - 1066.36] you have to trust me on this and I even
[1064.12 - 1068.24] hate saying trust me on this because
[1066.36 - 1070.08] we're not even allowed to say this in
[1068.24 - 1071.92] this world right now because there's a
[1070.08 - 1073.80] whole thing going on out there if you
[1071.92 - 1075.44] say trust me then people are like oh
[1073.80 - 1077.52] I've heard that don't want to trust but
[1075.44 - 1079.60] you better trust me because I'm telling
[1077.52 - 1082.64] you right now you're body does not
[1079.60 - 1085.48] attack itself it stands behind you it
[1082.64 - 1087.64] works for you it won't hurt you it's
[1085.48 - 1090.04] there helping you and medical research
[1087.64 - 1092.40] and medical science has no clue about
[1090.04 - 1094.16] this yet including alternative medicine
[1092.40 - 1097.08] the best alternative medicine books
[1094.16 - 1098.92] about autoimmune literally are rags and
[1097.08 - 1102.56] need to be thrown in the garbage because
[1098.92 - 1104.56] they say the the foundation is still
[1102.56 - 1107.84] your body is attacking itself they
[1104.56 - 1110.68] haven't even left that simple you know
[1107.84 - 1113.96] mistake or that great mistake they
[1110.68 - 1115.60] haven't even left the great mistake yet
[1113.96 - 1116.56] of knowing that your body is not
[1115.60 - 1119.00] attacking
[1116.56 - 1121.64] itself okay and I'm giving you that
[1119.00 - 1123.12] information now because it's important
[1121.64 - 1125.56] because we're going into the unforgiving
[1123.12 - 1127.96] four and there's four big things that
[1125.56 - 1130.76] are causing the problems and in
[1127.96 - 1132.68] completely tricking out the medical
[1130.76 - 1137.08] research and Medical Science World so
[1132.68 - 1140.20] they turn the whole thing around on you
[1137.08 - 1144.84] telling you that your body is attacking
[1140.20 - 1146.68] itself when it's not okay do you see why
[1144.84 - 1148.84] I'm so serious about this did you put
[1146.68 - 1150.32] your seat bels on you better put your
[1148.84 - 1153.56] seat bels on and you better not be
[1150.32 - 1156.12] driving an antique a 1960 you know
[1153.56 - 1159.40] Cadillac that Cadillac that has no or
[1156.12 - 1161.92] 1955 Buick or something that doesn't
[1159.40 - 1163.40] have a headrest on the back like the old
[1161.92 - 1165.00] days so when you got hit from behind
[1163.40 - 1167.00] your head wrenched back and you broke
[1165.00 - 1170.40] your neck on one little bumper bumper
[1167.00 - 1172.92] you know one little fender bender so no
[1170.40 - 1176.08] antiques make sure you're in make sure
[1172.92 - 1178.48] you're in some safe cars but just you
[1176.08 - 1179.88] got to know something you got to know
[1178.48 - 1183.76] something your body doesn't attack
[1179.88 - 1186.76] itself it's not there going against you
[1183.76 - 1189.24] it's because the unforgiving
[1186.76 - 1193.52] for is on our
[1189.24 - 1196.28] butts okay it's on our butts and it's
[1193.52 - 1197.72] interfering with our lives and it's
[1196.28 - 1200.20] tricking out medical research and
[1197.72 - 1203.20] medical science sence so that they put
[1200.20 - 1204.84] the blame on you it's so critical to
[1203.20 - 1207.48] know this we're going to get into these
[1204.84 - 1209.92] unforgiving for just but you have to
[1207.48 - 1211.60] have the foundation you have to have a
[1209.92 - 1214.24] foundation and the problem is in
[1211.60 - 1216.80] alternative medicine I like conventional
[1214.24 - 1221.00] medicine I like alternative medicine but
[1216.80 - 1224.84] I work for you so I don't take
[1221.00 - 1227.64] sides and I don't fall into to their
[1224.84 - 1229.44] false belief systems like the body
[1227.64 - 1231.24] attacking itself because I have Spirit
[1229.44 - 1234.64] telling me what's really going on with
[1231.24 - 1236.96] people because we work for you that's
[1234.64 - 1239.40] who I work for I get up in the morning
[1236.96 - 1241.04] and you know what I work for God but God
[1239.40 - 1242.40] says if you're going to work for me
[1241.04 - 1244.28] guess who you're going to be helping
[1242.40 - 1248.20] you're going to be helping everybody
[1244.28 - 1250.24] else so technically yes I'm helping you
[1248.20 - 1253.32] I'm working for you and I got to watch
[1250.24 - 1254.96] your back if I don't watch your back
[1253.32 - 1256.24] then you know then what then you're
[1254.96 - 1260.72] going to think your body's attacking
[1256.24 - 1264.48] itself that's what so it's important to
[1260.72 - 1266.20] know that research and science hasn't
[1264.48 - 1269.16] discovered what's causing problems and
[1266.20 - 1272.48] then alternative medicine you know God
[1269.16 - 1274.32] loving God loving absolutely thank God
[1272.48 - 1275.84] for any of our doctors alternative andc
[1274.32 - 1279.64] conventional medicine but alternative
[1275.84 - 1282.24] medicine some of the best trendy you
[1279.64 - 1284.56] know lit you know literature that's out
[1282.24 - 1287.80] there books that are out there is still
[1284.56 - 1290.72] antiques it they're still it's old time
[1287.80 - 1294.12] it's still old I don't care what fancy
[1290.72 - 1295.88] talk is in there about gut biome and
[1294.12 - 1298.92] about you know about you know the whole
[1295.88 - 1301.24] thing with um probiotics and about you
[1298.92 - 1302.32] know um about mot toxins I don't care
[1301.24 - 1305.00] what's in
[1302.32 - 1306.84] there if they still think your body's
[1305.00 - 1309.44] attacking itself and those are just
[1306.84 - 1312.72] triggers then it's it's
[1309.44 - 1315.20] behind because I'm going to give you
[1312.72 - 1318.96] today what's causing all our trouble
[1315.20 - 1320.04] another thing is mystery illness
[1318.96 - 1323.32] we're
[1320.04 - 1326.52] told that all your different ailments
[1323.32 - 1329.40] your symptoms your conditions are not
[1326.52 - 1332.24] mystery we're told that they're not
[1329.40 - 1333.76] mystery that they've been figured out if
[1332.24 - 1337.60] they've been figured out then why are we
[1333.76 - 1341.28] still sick why are 300 million Americans
[1337.60 - 1342.56] with symptoms and sick right now if we
[1341.28 - 1346.12] figured it
[1342.56 - 1348.52] out so they deem mystery illness just
[1346.12 - 1350.92] for like a handful of rare cases once a
[1348.52 - 1353.32] year once every three years you know
[1350.92 - 1356.16] like just a few people fell down with a
[1353.32 - 1357.92] fever somewhere and or some children
[1356.16 - 1359.72] were sick and because of some you know
[1357.92 - 1361.08] polluted pond water or something and
[1359.72 - 1362.04] it's just okay it's a mystery illness
[1361.08 - 1363.28] we're trying to figure it out they're
[1362.04 - 1365.84] trying to troubleshoot it here's the
[1363.28 - 1366.96] thing it's all mystery that's chronic
[1365.84 - 1370.96] illness
[1366.96 - 1373.96] related and what's behind all the
[1370.96 - 1376.28] mystery are the unforgiving for once
[1373.96 - 1379.04] again I'm going back to that cuz that's
[1376.28 - 1381.24] what we're on today
[1379.04 - 1383.24] and then it's all in your head it's
[1381.24 - 1385.36] another thing like you created it it's
[1383.24 - 1386.40] your fault you did it you you manifested
[1385.36 - 1389.72] your
[1386.40 - 1392.44] illness you know that's not true that's
[1389.72 - 1394.12] not true don't believe that either
[1392.44 - 1398.24] you're a good person you didn't created
[1394.12 - 1401.20] it the UN the unforgiving for is what
[1398.24 - 1403.00] creates it so you need to know that
[1401.20 - 1405.84] that's so important to
[1403.00 - 1408.32] know okay it doesn't mean we can't be
[1405.84 - 1410.44] our own trigger sometimes when we get
[1408.32 - 1412.20] hit with things and you know we get
[1410.44 - 1414.20] breakups in relationships and it hurts
[1412.20 - 1416.20] our heart so bad and we're so upset
[1414.20 - 1417.96] that's a trigger it's an emotional
[1416.20 - 1419.60] trigger but where we have to be able to
[1417.96 - 1422.64] experience emotion we have to be able to
[1419.60 - 1424.40] feel emotion so we can't be blamed for
[1422.64 - 1427.04] feeling emotion and having it kind of
[1424.40 - 1430.16] weaken us a little bit because that's
[1427.04 - 1431.72] just life the idea is to be able to have
[1430.16 - 1434.68] feel all the emotion you want whether
[1431.72 - 1437.44] it's good or bad and survive it and the
[1434.68 - 1440.60] unforgiving for is responsible for why
[1437.44 - 1442.20] we have a hard time why we're triggered
[1440.60 - 1444.32] by more things because the unforgiving
[1442.20 - 1446.08] four is behind it all so when you go
[1444.32 - 1447.60] through a hard time you can feel sick
[1446.08 - 1449.24] afterwards and then we blame ourselves
[1447.60 - 1451.88] when it's not
[1449.24 - 1455.68] ourselves because it's the unforgiving
[1451.88 - 1457.36] for see how it works very important and
[1455.68 - 1462.84] then here's a big one I just have to
[1457.36 - 1466.28] tell you genetics genes we're told it's
[1462.84 - 1468.00] our genes we're told it's your genes now
[1466.28 - 1469.36] that's why you're sick it's it's your
[1468.00 - 1473.36] jeans you got faulty jeans you're a
[1469.36 - 1476.52] faulty person that's demented cuz it's
[1473.36 - 1479.12] not accurate and it's destructive and
[1476.52 - 1482.40] poisonous these things are like weeds
[1479.12 - 1483.92] they're like weeds of poison in a
[1482.40 - 1487.04] beautiful garden and these are like
[1483.92 - 1489.08] weeds of poison that are taking over and
[1487.04 - 1491.28] they're going to hurt you because it's
[1489.08 - 1493.36] not genetics that is why you're sick or
[1491.28 - 1496.60] feeling sick research and science
[1493.36 - 1499.44] doesn't know it's the unforgiving
[1496.60 - 1502.08] for and and that's what it is not
[1499.44 - 1506.16] genetics our genes didn't go bad in the
[1502.08 - 1508.56] last 20 years that's why literally alone
[1506.16 - 1510.68] half the US is more sick than than
[1508.56 - 1512.20] meaning a whole half more of the US is
[1510.68 - 1513.88] more sick than it was 20 years ago no
[1512.20 - 1516.60] wondering 300 million Americans with
[1513.88 - 1518.00] symptoms that didn't exist years ago I
[1516.60 - 1520.32] promise you that didn't
[1518.00 - 1522.64] exist the American dream was you lived
[1520.32 - 1525.08] your life you did this you did that
[1522.64 - 1526.40] here's you got older here's what you did
[1525.08 - 1528.12] and sure you can have health problems
[1526.40 - 1530.16] along the way they always existed but
[1528.12 - 1532.64] nothing like they are today we're
[1530.16 - 1535.96] struggling young and younger and younger
[1532.64 - 1538.48] and younger and it's not genetics it's
[1535.96 - 1542.60] the unforgiving
[1538.48 - 1545.20] for so let's talk about that part now
[1542.60 - 1549.08] let's talk about it the first part of
[1545.20 - 1551.40] the unforgiving for is the viral
[1549.08 - 1553.40] explosion the viral
[1551.40 - 1556.72] explosion
[1553.40 - 1560.08] viruses understand the viruses have been
[1556.72 - 1563.24] in our way especially in the last 100
[1560.08 - 1566.52] years but now in the last 30 years in
[1563.24 - 1569.76] our way like never before in
[1566.52 - 1571.64] history they're in our way just take the
[1569.76 - 1574.72] Epstein bar virus which for the first
[1571.64 - 1577.32] time ever I brought to everybody's
[1574.72 - 1579.96] attention about what the Epstein bar
[1577.32 - 1581.72] does what symptoms it creates that alone
[1579.96 - 1583.76] from fibromyalgia chronic fatigue
[1581.72 - 1585.16] syndrome multiple sclerosis rheumatoid
[1583.76 - 1586.56] arthritis these are all varieties of
[1585.16 - 1590.12] Epstein bar and different varieties of
[1586.56 - 1593.68] Epstein bar tingles and numbness um
[1590.12 - 1597.76] blurry eyes brain fog uh ringing the
[1593.68 - 1600.36] ears vertigo dizziness aches and pains
[1597.76 - 1602.20] severe fatigue it's all Epstein bar
[1600.36 - 1604.52] related Hashimoto
[1602.20 - 1605.40] thyroiditis and the list goes on and on
[1604.52 - 1608.88] and
[1605.40 - 1611.64] on all from Epstein bar varieties alone
[1608.88 - 1613.20] that are exploding and you're becoming
[1611.64 - 1614.84] the expert and you're healing from them
[1613.20 - 1616.68] cuz we're helping everybody we're we're
[1614.84 - 1618.12] teaching everybody and we're helping
[1616.68 - 1621.20] everybody so everybody every body learns
[1618.12 - 1622.72] from it we all get better together and
[1621.20 - 1624.76] then there's other viruses too there's
[1622.72 - 1627.36] the shingles family that causes all the
[1624.76 - 1630.44] other stuff going on burning mouth
[1627.36 - 1633.56] burning tongue syndrome you know I'm
[1630.44 - 1636.24] burning you know vaginal area burning
[1633.56 - 1640.32] legs burning feet neuropathy in the feet
[1636.24 - 1643.40] and legs ciona trigeminal neuropathy
[1640.32 - 1647.64] trigeminal nerve problems all these
[1643.40 - 1651.08] things are shingles Bells Palsy um
[1647.64 - 1652.52] droopy eyes droopy you know all of that
[1651.08 - 1655.00] is the shingles
[1652.52 - 1657.20] virus and and the shingles does even
[1655.00 - 1659.32] more but the these are the things that
[1657.20 - 1663.56] I'm talking about and then there's other
[1659.32 - 1666.84] viruses too like hhv6 hhv7 HH the
[1663.56 - 1669.80] Undiscovered hhv 9 10 11 12 that Spirit
[1666.84 - 1672.28] knows about and they're in our way they
[1669.80 - 1674.80] create different types of heart problems
[1672.28 - 1676.44] uh myocarditis endocarditis kidney
[1674.80 - 1678.92] problems kidney failure all the
[1676.44 - 1681.72] different problems and these viruses
[1678.92 - 1684.64] exist it's part of the unforgiving for
[1681.72 - 1687.56] and everybody wants to ignore them and
[1684.64 - 1691.00] now that we're also bringing it to light
[1687.56 - 1693.00] um some some leaders are taking the
[1691.00 - 1694.92] information Spirit brought and they're
[1693.00 - 1697.04] using it for their own game for you know
[1694.92 - 1698.68] a claim and notoriety but skewing the
[1697.04 - 1700.64] information so it ends up not helping
[1698.68 - 1703.68] people anyway so thank God I have you
[1700.64 - 1705.48] guys behind me because you guys are
[1703.68 - 1708.00] taking the information and I and trust
[1705.48 - 1709.48] in you and I trust that you guys you
[1708.00 - 1711.08] know know the source and I trust that
[1709.48 - 1712.56] you guys know it's never been talked
[1711.08 - 1714.48] about out there and I trust that you
[1712.56 - 1716.48] guys know you know how to spread the
[1714.48 - 1718.32] information wisely and help others
[1716.48 - 1720.48] whenever you can over the years and over
[1718.32 - 1723.16] the time and I thank you for it and I
[1720.48 - 1725.80] thank you for it okay because you guys
[1723.16 - 1730.52] are the real deal the real
[1725.80 - 1732.92] deal so here's the deal we got the viral
[1730.52 - 1735.04] explosion there's always been bacteria
[1732.92 - 1736.60] bacteria causes problems we talk about
[1735.04 - 1738.40] that in the different shows we talked
[1736.60 - 1739.92] about in the stret show we talk about it
[1738.40 - 1741.84] in you know the STP aaka show we talk
[1739.92 - 1744.48] about it in the different shows that
[1741.84 - 1747.00] bacteria is a problem we know that but
[1744.48 - 1748.68] the viral explosion is why we're dealing
[1747.00 - 1750.52] what we're dealing it's why mommies lay
[1748.68 - 1753.12] in bed and can't function and they got
[1750.52 - 1755.20] three kids they can't feed and you know
[1753.12 - 1757.60] it's it's literally like that kind of
[1755.20 - 1758.92] thing all the time out there now it's
[1757.60 - 1760.48] why we got the fatigue we got the
[1758.92 - 1762.92] mysterious weight gain it's why we have
[1760.48 - 1764.36] the thyroid problems and it's why people
[1762.92 - 1766.48] are got the brain fog and the memory
[1764.36 - 1768.84] loss and they're just having difficult
[1766.48 - 1770.40] times and they have all the different
[1768.84 - 1773.28] neurological symptoms it's a viral
[1770.40 - 1775.24] explosion so and what we're about is
[1773.28 - 1777.20] about cleaning that up and getting that
[1775.24 - 1780.12] better in life-changing Foods I talk
[1777.20 - 1783.88] about the unforgiving for in detail and
[1780.12 - 1786.68] I talk about all the foods to help
[1783.88 - 1789.16] eradicate the unforgiving for in your
[1786.68 - 1790.36] life so when you go through there and
[1789.16 - 1792.80] what I meant you're not going to be
[1790.36 - 1794.96] disappointed when you go through there
[1792.80 - 1795.88] you're going to see the unforgiving for
[1794.96 - 1798.00] in
[1795.88 - 1799.16] detail and then
[1798.00 - 1802.68] you're going to know how to get rid of
[1799.16 - 1804.44] the unforgiving for throughout that book
[1802.68 - 1806.56] so that you can protect your family and

[1813.64 - 1820.76] happy about it the next part of the
[1815.80 - 1822.60] unforgiving for the next part is
[1820.76 - 1825.44] radiation
[1822.60 - 1828.76] radiation we're not looking at radiation
[1825.44 - 1832.16] we ignore it we ignore it distance is
[1828.76 - 1833.56] falling out of the sky and that's okay
[1832.16 - 1834.92] same with the viruses you have to
[1833.56 - 1836.92] understand all this is okay because we
[1834.92 - 1840.36] got answers we got ways to protect
[1836.92 - 1843.36] ourselves we got ways to heal now if I
[1840.36 - 1844.80] just try to play the positive crap talk
[1843.36 - 1847.48] where that this stuff doesn't really
[1844.80 - 1849.32] exist and I just want to talk about hey

[1851.52 - 1856.44] truth not tell you really what's going
[1853.64 - 1858.04] on not tell you what's happening that
[1856.44 - 1859.60] would be the worst that would be

[1875.04 - 1880.12] with me while I talk about radiation a
[1876.64 - 1883.20] little bit it's fallen out of the sky
[1880.12 - 1884.84] okay from literally World War II never
[1883.20 - 1886.28] mind Fukushima which is falling out of
[1884.84 - 1888.88] the sky because of Fukushima 2o it's
[1886.28 - 1891.40] starting to you name it Chernobyl you
[1888.88 - 1894.88] name it it's been falling out of the
[1891.40 - 1898.28] sky and it still is and it's in her way
[1894.88 - 1902.08] and it's not just that our forefathers
[1898.28 - 1905.40] our family like our past
[1902.08 - 1907.36] relatives that we come from were
[1905.40 - 1910.00] saturated in radiation as well during
[1907.36 - 1911.92] the first x-rays during the first the
[1910.00 - 1914.44] birth of the x-rays when we were like oh
[1911.92 - 1918.12] my God this is exciting hop in front of
[1914.44 - 1919.76] this machine get completely radiated
[1918.12 - 1923.24] from head to toe where you see a
[1919.76 - 1925.12] complete skeleton you know you see a
[1923.24 - 1927.04] complete skeleton up against the the
[1925.12 - 1928.80] screen the flat screen that's in front
[1927.04 - 1930.84] of the person and you just just slam
[1928.80 - 1933.48] them with tons of
[1930.84 - 1936.80] radiation and women were getting
[1933.48 - 1938.48] radiation treatments to their faces and
[1936.80 - 1939.92] they were getting radiation severe
[1938.48 - 1941.68] radiation Burns because they were
[1939.92 - 1945.20] getting radiation treatments and the old
[1941.68 - 1947.36] Dental the old dental work the radiation
[1945.20 - 1951.24] it's shot right into everybody's neck
[1947.36 - 1953.76] and head it was all in the past but the
[1951.24 - 1957.32] problem is it gets passed down cuz it
[1953.76 - 1960.04] lasts a million years and it's in our
[1957.32 - 1962.80] forefathers then we we're conceived
[1960.04 - 1965.08] we're birthed we have it it's just down
[1962.80 - 1967.32] the line from all the way back down the
[1965.08 - 1969.88] line since radiation was even figured
[1967.32 - 1971.28] out and discovered now we could just
[1969.88 - 1972.76] ignore it and forget about it and not
[1971.28 - 1975.52] realize it's breaking down our immune
[1972.76 - 1977.12] system and we're going to fix it there's
[1975.52 - 1978.36] people that come to me like and say I
[1977.12 - 1980.12] been to every doctor I've Been
[1978.36 - 1982.32] Everywhere why is my immune system still
[1980.12 - 1983.56] breaking down I've seen everybody I've
[1982.32 - 1985.64] paid
[1983.56 - 1987.64] $500,000 a half a million dollars to
[1985.64 - 1992.12] travel around the globe and around the
[1987.64 - 1994.12] world to try to fix my immune system and
[1992.12 - 1996.12] it hasn't
[1994.12 - 1998.72] happened and spirit would be like you
[1996.12 - 2001.72] you got some radiation because your
[1998.72 - 2005.08] forefathers were saturated with it and
[2001.72 - 2007.80] died early because of it and like oh my
[2005.08 - 2010.68] God yeah but we can fix it we can get it
[2007.80 - 2014.08] out we can get it out with the right
[2010.68 - 2015.68] Foods the power of the foods can get it
[2014.08 - 2016.68] out if you know what you're using and
[2015.68 - 2019.76] know what you're
[2016.68 - 2024.72] doing we can get it out of the
[2019.76 - 2028.08] body it's that simple but it takes a
[2024.72 - 2030.44] little bit of work takes a little bit of
[2028.08 - 2032.84] food it takes a little bit of time a
[2030.44 - 2034.92] little bit of energy but you can do it
[2032.84 - 2037.04] but the radiation is falling out of the
[2034.92 - 2039.16] sky it's definitely hindering us it's
[2037.04 - 2041.12] landing on our food sources and that's
[2039.16 - 2043.68] okay because food gets rid of it and can
[2041.12 - 2045.84] cancel it out the right kind of foods
[2043.68 - 2047.92] can get rid of it and cancel it out we
[2045.84 - 2052.24] can pull old radiation out of us that's
[2047.92 - 2054.76] been in there for for a century from our
[2052.24 - 2059.24] forefathers and it can be
[2054.76 - 2061.60] done okay that's part of the unforgiving
[2059.24 - 2063.84] for next part of the unforgiving for
[2061.60 - 2066.96] toxic heavy
[2063.84 - 2069.56] metals yeah toxic heavy metals Mercury
[2066.96 - 2072.88] we have mercury in us that's a thousand
[2069.56 - 2076.64] years old that's been mined out of Minds
[2072.88 - 2080.40] thousand years ago and it stays in our
[2076.64 - 2082.44] line it's not genetics everybody I'm
[2080.40 - 2084.08] sorry to say it I don't mean to break
[2082.44 - 2085.76] the hearts of the leaders that are
[2084.08 - 2087.48] taking the genetic movement where they
[2085.76 - 2090.60] are and the leaders that think that all
[2087.48 - 2093.44] of our problems are genes I'm sorry that
[2090.60 - 2096.96] all their funding and all their hard
[2093.44 - 2099.28] work is not for the right thing I'm
[2096.96 - 2102.00] sorry that's not my fault so I just have
[2099.28 - 2104.24] to tell you the truth I can't protect
[2102.00 - 2108.40] them I have to protect
[2104.24 - 2111.56] you and it's not jeans it's Mercury
[2108.40 - 2113.84] passed down generation after generation
[2111.56 - 2115.52] hundreds of years of Mercury from when
[2113.84 - 2117.44] our forefathers were drinking Mercury
[2115.52 - 2119.08] Elixir just in the 1800s when all the
[2117.44 - 2120.56] medical universities were closing down
[2119.08 - 2121.68] because nobody went to doctors anymore
[2120.56 - 2124.80] in the
[2121.68 - 2127.80] 1850s and the 1840s and the
[2124.80 - 2129.20] 1860s no one went to doctors anymore
[2127.80 - 2131.00] they went for they went that's how
[2129.20 - 2133.48] alternative healers were birthed they
[2131.00 - 2137.80] were birthed out of the Mercury the
[2133.48 - 2139.00] Mercury uh bomb of the uh 19th century
[2137.80 - 2140.84] when the me when the conventional
[2139.00 - 2142.60] medical world just gave you a big glass
[2140.84 - 2144.00] of mercury when you went to the doctor's
[2142.60 - 2145.80] office didn't matter who you were when
[2144.00 - 2149.76] you left the doctor's office you were
[2145.80 - 2151.80] raving you were raging mad Insanity
[2149.76 - 2154.00] occurred you went home and your life was
[2151.80 - 2155.88] over your family's life was over if you
[2154.00 - 2157.16] were a working father and and you were
[2155.88 - 2158.84] dependent on and you went went to the
[2157.16 - 2161.00] doctor and drank a big glass of mercury
[2158.84 - 2161.72] solution came home your wife would be
[2161.00 - 2163.64] just
[2161.72 - 2165.36] mortified and that was it you weren't
[2163.64 - 2167.24] going to work the next day bills weren't
[2165.36 - 2169.52] paid families crashed and that happened
[2167.24 - 2171.28] because of the Mercury Elixir we still
[2169.52 - 2173.20] have that in our bloodline it's not
[2171.28 - 2176.32] genetics we got the Mercury in our
[2173.20 - 2178.44] bloodline see how it works sometimes
[2176.32 - 2181.12] going all the way back hundreds of years
[2178.44 - 2183.56] all the way back going hundreds of years
[2181.12 - 2185.12] Mercury all dating back to the Mercury
[2183.56 - 2186.88] man and it's Mercury it's just
[2185.12 - 2188.20] everywhere it's in our water it's it's
[2186.88 - 2191.20] just you mean it's in the ocean it's
[2188.20 - 2194.52] just everywhere it's all over the place
[2191.20 - 2196.36] so the point is is that that Mercury's
[2194.52 - 2198.60] responsible for so many things
[2196.36 - 2200.60] depression Mercury responsible for
[2198.60 - 2202.60] anxiety it feeds Epstein bar it feeds
[2200.60 - 2205.32] the viral explosion they work together
[2202.60 - 2207.84] the heavy metals and I'm all toxic heavy
[2205.32 - 2209.88] metals and they feed the viral explosion
[2207.84 - 2212.04] working together to help take us down
[2209.88 - 2213.88] but guess what it won't take us down I'm
[2212.04 - 2216.48] telling you my friend I'm telling you
[2213.88 - 2218.96] folks it won't take us down because we
[2216.48 - 2220.24] have have a way to fight it clean it out
[2218.96 - 2221.88] I talked about the Frozen wild
[2220.24 - 2223.52] blueberries removes heavy metals I talk
[2221.88 - 2226.84] about the heavy metal detox check out my
[2223.52 - 2229.44] heavy metal detox check it out it's in
[2226.84 - 2231.96] book one the heavy metal detox from
[2229.44 - 2233.44] Spirit to remove that heavy metal out of
[2231.96 - 2235.44] your system so you can get rid of your
[2233.44 - 2238.16] symptoms that correlate with the viral
[2235.44 - 2239.08] explosion you can get rid of that out of
[2238.16 - 2241.08] your
[2239.08 - 2242.64] body okay and and I'm going to give you
[2241.08 - 2244.20] some tips first of all if you get heavy
[2242.64 - 2245.68] metal tested and it shows really low
[2244.20 - 2247.16] doesn't mean it's not really high cuz
[2245.68 - 2248.76] they can't test inside your nervous
[2247.16 - 2251.00] system they can't test to see how much
[2248.76 - 2253.76] mercury you have in your nervous system
[2251.00 - 2255.80] this is a mistake made all the time you
[2253.76 - 2257.12] know Spirit told one person that I know
[2255.80 - 2258.64] a while back Spirit told one person
[2257.12 - 2260.92] you're really high in heavy metal you're
[2258.64 - 2263.04] high in mercury that's why you're you're
[2260.92 - 2264.60] feeling like you're feeling and they're
[2263.04 - 2268.12] like well I don't believe you because I
[2264.60 - 2271.12] had a test and the test said I was low
[2268.12 - 2273.40] first of all the test for heavy metals
[2271.12 - 2276.04] is not even accurate because it cannot
[2273.40 - 2278.60] test how much heavy metal it's inside
[2276.04 - 2280.84] deep in organ or inside the central
[2278.60 - 2283.24] nervous system or inside your brain it
[2280.84 - 2285.56] can only test if you've been freshly
[2283.24 - 2287.36] exposed to heavy metal in the
[2285.56 - 2290.12] bloodstream that means you would have
[2287.36 - 2292.88] had to eat a can of tuna the day you got
[2290.12 - 2295.40] the blood test so the can of tuna would
[2292.88 - 2297.68] leech the mercury into your bloodstream
[2295.40 - 2299.48] the day of your blood test or the day
[2297.68 - 2302.96] before your blood test to show up a
[2299.48 - 2305.72] little bit of mercury a little
[2302.96 - 2307.04] bit and nobody knows that information
[2305.72 - 2309.56] but you know it now
[2307.04 - 2312.00] you know it now because of spirit and
[2309.56 - 2314.60] that's how it works so we get the toxic
[2312.00 - 2317.20] heavy metals they go inside our liver
[2314.60 - 2320.52] they're inside our brain they're deep in
[2317.20 - 2323.68] our system and Mercury is a big big
[2320.52 - 2326.28] piece of it all never mind the alloy the
[2323.68 - 2330.84] alloy that occurs you guys what happens
[2326.28 - 2334.28] is when they make steel they mix it with
[2330.84 - 2337.04] Metals when they make when they make a
[2334.28 - 2339.88] bicycle they have an alloy different
[2337.04 - 2342.48] varieties of metals to make the bike
[2339.88 - 2345.48] lighter and stronger it's called an
[2342.48 - 2347.12] alloy right when we get these Alloys
[2345.48 - 2349.36] inside our brain in our body I talked
[2347.12 - 2351.96] about it in the brain health show we get
[2349.36 - 2355.00] these Alloys they're a mix of metals
[2351.96 - 2357.88] disturbing our function giving us a low
[2355.00 - 2360.84] quality of life giving us
[2357.88 - 2363.32] symptoms and even some
[2360.84 - 2367.16] conditions and this is the the the
[2363.32 - 2369.76] movement of mean this is the Wrath
[2367.16 - 2371.40] of the toxic heavy metals part of the
[2369.76 - 2373.92] unforgiving
[2371.40 - 2376.68] for and once you start taking these
[2373.92 - 2378.20] things out with the foods you need once
[2376.68 - 2380.24] you start taking them out with the foods
[2378.20 - 2381.88] you need and you start taking the
[2380.24 - 2384.36] radiation out with the foods you need
[2381.88 - 2386.64] radiation that's not even yours not even
[2384.36 - 2389.84] yours and you end up owning it when it's
[2386.64 - 2392.16] not even yours it's pushed on you same
[2389.84 - 2394.76] with the toxic heavy metals toxic heavy
[2392.16 - 2398.12] metals from the past that's not even
[2394.76 - 2400.84] yours it's somebody else is all the way
[2398.12 - 2403.76] back and it's not even
[2400.84 - 2408.44] yours okay and we get these things and
[2403.76 - 2410.92] we have them and it's time it's time to
[2408.44 - 2413.04] get them out of our body and out of our
[2410.92 - 2414.48] system so we can get rid of the
[2413.04 - 2416.68] unforgiving
[2414.48 - 2418.44] four we're going to recap a little bit
[2416.68 - 2420.80] cuz we still got one more to go still
[2418.44 - 2422.44] got one more unforgiving four to go
[2420.80 - 2425.36] we're going to recap a little bit we got
[2422.44 - 2427.16] the viral explosion all the upstein bars
[2425.36 - 2428.88] I was the first to break to the table
[2427.16 - 2431.76] that there's over 60 varieties of
[2428.88 - 2434.64] Epstein bar in six different groups and
[2431.76 - 2437.56] they date all the way back to the late
[2434.64 - 2439.88] 1890s and they've mutated they've grown
[2437.56 - 2441.64] in different strains that's what we're
[2439.88 - 2443.48] up against and you are cleaning it out
[2441.64 - 2446.64] and you're kicking but because you're
[2443.48 - 2448.32] getting rid of those viruses right now I
[2446.64 - 2449.72] got people all over the world getting
[2448.32 - 2451.80] rid of their viruses getting rid of
[2449.72 - 2454.32] their Epstein bar and they're gaining
[2451.80 - 2456.08] they're getting their life back and you
[2454.32 - 2458.64] can too and you're already doing it
[2456.08 - 2461.76] you're you're already working on it and
[2458.64 - 2464.28] so it's the foods that that starve out
[2461.76 - 2466.40] the viral explosion get rid of it help
[2464.28 - 2468.84] clean it out you name it we talked about
[2466.40 - 2470.56] that on the Epstein bar webinar recently
[2468.84 - 2472.60] we talked about that on the Epstein bar
[2470.56 - 2475.00] show and that's what we're doing and
[2472.60 - 2476.48] then we got the radiation the radiation
[2475.00 - 2478.12] going all the way back we since World
[2476.48 - 2480.00] War II it's falling out of the sky we're
[2478.12 - 2481.60] getting rid of that too out of our
[2480.00 - 2482.96] bodies all the different you know
[2481.60 - 2485.28] radiation that was passed on from the
[2482.96 - 2488.56] forefathers getting it from old x-rays
[2485.28 - 2490.44] and everything we're getting rid of that
[2488.56 - 2491.96] and then the toxic heavy metals we
[2490.44 - 2496.28] talked about that just now let's talk
[2491.96 - 2498.08] about the number four of the unforgiving
[2496.28 - 2501.40] for it's
[2498.08 - 2506.52] DDT would you believe it
[2501.40 - 2509.24] DDT why would DDT even be possible isn't
[2506.52 - 2512.96] that something from the past isn't that
[2509.24 - 2515.40] over with isn't that done right I mean
[2512.96 - 2518.72] is DDT like you don't hear about it
[2515.40 - 2522.64] anymore right right I know you don't
[2518.72 - 2524.96] hear about it anymore and it's DDT where
[2522.64 - 2527.16] is it what's it doing it's first of all
[2524.96 - 2530.08] it's not gone and there's other
[2527.16 - 2532.24] pesticides and herbicides and fungicides
[2530.08 - 2535.24] and insecticides that are its cousins
[2532.24 - 2537.56] that are here every day being sprayed
[2535.24 - 2540.64] everywhere else but even DDT itself is
[2537.56 - 2544.44] not gone it's not gone what of the most
[2540.64 - 2547.16] evst chemicals of all time one of them
[2544.44 - 2550.04] and it's still being put on
[2547.16 - 2552.20] food it's still being sprayed in all
[2550.04 - 2556.56] kinds of different countries around the
[2552.20 - 2559.84] world and it's still in the air it's
[2556.56 - 2564.08] still in the air it's still in our water
[2559.84 - 2568.00] it's still in our ocean it's still
[2564.08 - 2572.24] everywhere and it's in our way the worst
[2568.00 - 2573.84] part about DDT it's Everlasting you guys
[2572.24 - 2576.72] it's
[2573.84 - 2580.68] Everlasting we it comes from our for
[2576.72 - 2584.92] forefathers our family of in the past
[2580.68 - 2587.92] our families would eat it sleep in it
[2584.92 - 2590.48] breathe it bathe in it we were washed
[2587.92 - 2592.16] down in it Parks were washed down hosed
[2590.48 - 2594.72] while all of the children were just
[2592.16 - 2597.48] saturated in it and sued up in it and
[2594.72 - 2599.56] rolling around in it it was sprayed on
[2597.48 - 2602.76] food it was considered a nutritional
[2599.56 - 2604.36] supplement it was in every Garden around
[2602.76 - 2606.76] everyone's
[2604.36 - 2609.48] house and it killed all practically
[2606.76 - 2612.32] every single bald eagle in this
[2609.48 - 2614.96] country okay and it's done worse than
[2612.32 - 2616.88] that it's done terrible things and it
[2614.96 - 2618.52] sits inside people inside their livers
[2616.88 - 2620.68] and it's passed on to generation and
[2618.52 - 2622.64] generation and we still have it in US
[2620.68 - 2625.40] hey look I'm not going to I'm not going
[2622.64 - 2626.72] to cookie cut this and just pretend this
[2625.40 - 2629.20] is just a you know a cute little
[2626.72 - 2631.60] positive talk show about how this and
[2629.20 - 2633.24] that you know like I know it's getting
[2631.60 - 2634.68] done out there and I get it I respect it
[2633.24 - 2636.60] but I'm saying I'm not going to hold
[2634.68 - 2639.88] this back from you I got to help protect
[2636.60 - 2641.96] you and help look out for you and so you
[2639.88 - 2643.24] can get the DDT out of your liver you
[2641.96 - 2645.24] can get it out of there so it's not
[2643.24 - 2648.40] giving you exmos orasis so it's not
[2645.24 - 2649.76] causing problems so you can get it out
[2648.40 - 2653.44] of you so it's not breaking down the
[2649.76 - 2654.52] immune system and we can do that and
[2653.44 - 2656.12] that's what I talk about in the book
[2654.52 - 2658.96] especially life changing foods to 50
[2656.12 - 2661.16] foods and I Mark which ones take out DDT
[2658.96 - 2662.96] which ones take out DDT and eliminate it
[2661.16 - 2665.08] and pull it out and extract it from our
[2662.96 - 2667.60] livers DDT that you don't even get I
[2665.08 - 2669.12] mean DDT that's from the past that's
[2667.60 - 2670.96] literally from your
[2669.12 - 2673.32] grandfather or
[2670.96 - 2676.16] great-grandfather playing with it in the
[2673.32 - 2678.24] garden or or just getting it all over
[2676.16 - 2680.00] him because it was sprayed in every
[2678.24 - 2681.72] neighborhood every neighborhood in the
[2680.00 - 2684.72] streets they used to wash the streets
[2681.72 - 2686.80] down with it wash the streets down with
[2684.72 - 2689.40] it literally it didn't matter if you
[2686.80 - 2691.96] were walking on the street as it
[2689.40 - 2694.80] happened it was a movement of
[2691.96 - 2696.88] destruction of the worst way it's one of
[2694.80 - 2699.92] the worst unforgiving for but hidden
[2696.88 - 2701.32] away it's in it's in the closet you go
[2699.92 - 2702.64] to the doctor's office you got all these
[2701.32 - 2704.56] symptoms no one's going to know they're
[2702.64 - 2707.04] going to blame it on your jeans why not
[2704.56 - 2712.00] it's the easy way out blame it on
[2707.04 - 2714.76] you I mean hey look I'm not blaming
[2712.00 - 2719.36] you I'm not blaming
[2714.76 - 2722.52] you okay cuz it's not your fault it's
[2719.36 - 2725.40] not your fault here's the problem though
[2722.52 - 2727.24] you know our youth is coming up and they
[2725.40 - 2729.20] just they know know they don't know
[2727.24 - 2730.72] anything about any of this they have no
[2729.20 - 2733.72] clue about the viral explosion they have
[2730.72 - 2735.24] no clue about how Epstein bar Works they
[2733.72 - 2736.72] have no clue about any of this and then
[2735.24 - 2738.84] they go to then they go to different you
[2736.72 - 2740.12] know practitioner schools and Doctor
[2738.84 - 2742.48] schools and everything and they come out
[2740.12 - 2744.36] of it and they still don't know it's not
[2742.48 - 2746.16] nothing bad everybody's trying
[2744.36 - 2747.76] everybody's working on it and then and
[2746.16 - 2750.08] then our youth in general our children
[2747.76 - 2755.16] grow up and they they just they just
[2750.08 - 2759.36] don't know so we have to look out for
[2755.16 - 2761.84] everybody and ourselves it can't just be
[2759.36 - 2763.52] you it can't be about me me me me me you
[2761.84 - 2767.20] know when I was putting out the first
[2763.52 - 2769.32] book medical medium someone said to me
[2767.20 - 2773.16] hey you're going to be an author
[2769.32 - 2776.40] now you know it's going to it's it it's
[2773.16 - 2779.64] all about you okay it's not about me
[2776.40 - 2781.80] it's not about me what are you saying
[2779.64 - 2783.48] it's it's about everybody else and
[2781.80 - 2786.32] getting them better and I stand behind
[2783.48 - 2790.44] that I still do I still do
[2786.32 - 2792.64] and it's about you guys that's what it's
[2790.44 - 2794.40] about it's not about me I said you know
[2792.64 - 2797.20] what I'm changing the rules I said to
[2794.40 - 2798.68] this person I'm changing the rules it's
[2797.20 - 2800.84] not going to be about me in my life it's
[2798.68 - 2802.52] not going to be about me in my life I'm
[2800.84 - 2804.32] changing the rules it's about everybody
[2802.52 - 2805.96] else for real but for real it's about
[2804.32 - 2809.16] everyone else and it's not being cookie
[2805.96 - 2811.32] cuted it's not going to be held back
[2809.16 - 2812.92] it's not going to be ignored I'm going
[2811.32 - 2814.08] to make sure people get better hell high
[2812.92 - 2815.36] water I don't care what it takes I'm
[2814.08 - 2817.92] going to make sure people get better I
[2815.36 - 2820.16] don't care What It
[2817.92 - 2823.56] Takes we're going to do
[2820.16 - 2825.88] it so DDT is one of the ones that snuck
[2823.56 - 2827.52] up on us along the way and we can get it
[2825.88 - 2829.44] out of our system and the pesticides
[2827.52 - 2832.40] today and the its cousins the pesticides
[2829.44 - 2836.12] insecticides herbicides rodenticides
[2832.40 - 2839.76] fungicides you know those are in our way
[2836.12 - 2843.08] too and they add into it and we can pull
[2839.76 - 2844.52] all that out with the right foods with
[2843.08 - 2846.72] the right
[2844.52 - 2848.76] foods and and you know give you just a
[2846.72 - 2850.92] rundown it's why celery juice is so
[2848.76 - 2852.44] powerful the mineral salts in it bind on
[2850.92 - 2855.48] to these poisons and help remove it out
[2852.44 - 2857.28] of the liver you know I you know I heard
[2855.48 - 2858.56] the other day someone else said because

[3032.76 - 3037.80] of them is the right kind of zinc till
[3034.92 - 3040.40] this day even the most advanced book
[3037.80 - 3042.12] coming out on thyroid or anything else
[3040.40 - 3044.20] coming out literally this year that's
[3042.12 - 3046.48] still that's just coming out this year
[3044.20 - 3048.24] and early next year still doesn't even
[3046.48 - 3050.52] know about the real zinc yet the one
[3048.24 - 3053.08] that helps stop the viral explosion the
[3050.52 - 3054.44] Epstein bars still doesn't even know the
[3053.08 - 3059.52] right zinc
[3054.44 - 3061.00] yet so you have to understand it's about
[3059.52 - 3063.60] watching your back for real and
[3061.00 - 3067.28] protecting you making sure we're getting
[3063.60 - 3070.56] you better and getting you moved forward
[3067.28 - 3073.28] so seaweeds the Atlantic coast seaweeds
[3070.56 - 3075.48] I like at I like the main lantic Co sea
[3073.28 - 3077.16] vegetables and you know here's another
[3075.48 - 3080.28] thing too you can't worry about what's
[3077.16 - 3083.00] in a seaweed especially the main Coast
[3080.28 - 3085.00] seaweeds because there's not enough of
[3083.00 - 3087.04] the problems in it there's not enough
[3085.00 - 3088.56] heavy metal in the seaweed in fact what
[3087.04 - 3093.04] happens is when you eat the seaweed like
[3088.56 - 3096.16] the dolls it removes more heavy metal in
[3093.04 - 3098.84] fact any trace of ocean metal that could
[3096.16 - 3101.28] be in a seaweed like douls stays in
[3098.84 - 3103.12] douls never leaves it until it leaves
[3101.28 - 3105.80] your body in fact what happens is a
[3103.12 - 3108.24] miracle happens the seaweed absorbs more
[3105.80 - 3111.32] and more of it out of your own body
[3108.24 - 3114.00] pulls it all in one you know one group
[3111.32 - 3115.48] out of the body in case someone's ready
[3114.00 - 3117.84] to had you know another question that
[3115.48 - 3119.52] came up actually was you know how do
[3117.84 - 3120.84] seaweed work if it's in our ocean well
[3119.52 - 3122.20] I'll tell you how it works it holds on
[3120.84 - 3124.12] to whatever what was in it and then it
[3122.20 - 3126.80] takes out double triple quadruple more
[3124.12 - 3128.48] right out of the body and we pull the
[3126.80 - 3133.08] heavy metals out of our
[3128.48 - 3134.52] body so we got that we got the seaweeds
[3133.08 - 3136.84] we got and and I talk about that in
[3134.52 - 3140.32] life-changing Foods too that's another
[3136.84 - 3142.44] way of getting rid of things spirulina
[3140.32 - 3144.64] make sure you're taking your spirulina
[3142.44 - 3145.88] that pulls out toxic heavy metals it
[3144.64 - 3148.12] helps pull out
[3145.88 - 3150.88] radiation and it does help pull out a
[3148.12 - 3153.64] little bit of DDT get the hne spirulina
[3150.88 - 3155.12] that's another Inc incredible tool but
[3153.64 - 3157.00] when you go through everything you're
[3155.12 - 3163.20] going to see all the different things
[3157.00 - 3166.28] all the different um foods and herbs and
[3163.20 - 3168.00] other information to help get rid of the
[3166.28 - 3172.12] unforgiving
