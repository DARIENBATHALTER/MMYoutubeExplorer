[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.56] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.20] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.56 - 49.44] Williams we're talking about
[47.20 - 51.48] chumming and before you think about it
[49.44 - 55.04] and you're like what is chumming just
[51.48 - 57.12] know a lot of people do it they do it
[55.04 - 60.08] every single day they don't realize
[57.12 - 62.52] they're doing it but they're doing it so
[60.08 - 64.88] why should I care about chumming or why
[62.52 - 67.96] should all of us care about chumming
[64.88 - 70.64] because it leads to chronic illness it
[67.96 - 72.60] speeds up chronic illness it brings us
[70.64 - 76.56] into chronic illness
[72.60 - 79.96] flares the world is getting sick and
[76.56 - 83.12] sicker because the world doesn't realize
[79.96 - 86.28] it but they're chumming get ready for
[83.12 - 88.48] this ride I say fasten your seat bels
[86.28 - 90.36] for sure grab yourself a cup of tea if
[88.48 - 92.36] you need to some herbal tea but I'm
[90.36 - 94.72] telling you now this is going to be a
[92.36 - 94.72] wild
[95.60 - 100.96] ride what a nice day out here in the
[98.04 - 103.64] water yeah we're almost at a destination
[100.96 - 105.64] all right the boat slowing down good
[103.64 - 108.12] good good good all right I say we do an
[105.64 - 111.24] inventory let's do that inventory now
[108.12 - 115.28] get the barrels out you got them okay
[111.24 - 121.24] you got your notepad there okay fish
[115.28 - 123.72] guts check okay fish guts great p pig
[121.24 - 126.60] heads you can't find them it's not
[123.72 - 129.36] Barrel there pig heads oh you got them
[126.60 - 132.68] great check cow
[129.36 - 136.64] guts cow guts yeah we got a barrel of
[132.68 - 138.00] cow guts that's it right there great
[136.64 - 140.12] fish
[138.00 - 141.92] guts you don't know which one that is
[140.12 - 144.76] you think that was the cow guts no
[141.92 - 146.96] that's that's the fish guts Barrel okay
[144.76 - 149.44] check pigs
[146.96 - 150.92] blood that's the barrel filled of pigs
[149.44 - 153.44] blood
[150.92 - 157.96] yep okay good
[153.44 - 159.80] check fish heads all right that's easy
[157.96 - 161.20] just open up the cap on that Barrel see
[159.80 - 162.24] all the fish heads right there there all
[161.20 - 165.24] kinds of fish
[162.24 - 168.28] heads Perfect all right get the barrel
[165.24 - 169.96] ready bring it to the back of the boat
[168.28 - 172.04] you got everything rigged you got your
[169.96 - 174.96] fishing poles got your
[172.04 - 178.92] Harpoon all right let's do this dump
[174.96 - 181.72] that Barrel over okay oh just watch it
[178.92 - 185.24] you splashed it on me
[181.72 - 188.36] okay great I just love
[185.24 - 191.56] chumming this is the best
[188.36 - 195.00] part so when we're chumming out there in
[191.56 - 197.88] the water and we're fishing we're trying
[195.00 - 201.20] to get sharks or any kind of other
[197.88 - 205.12] creature that actually loves the smell
[201.20 - 206.52] of blood loves the taste of fish Parts
[205.12 - 208.56] when we're chumming we're trying to
[206.52 - 210.44] catch something same thing with trying
[208.56 - 213.76] to catch crab
[210.44 - 216.76] people who crab put bait in the
[213.76 - 219.24] Trap The Crab Trap same thing with
[216.76 - 221.44] lobsters you put bait in the lobster
[219.24 - 225.04] trap because you're trying to catch
[221.44 - 227.52] something and get them what people don't
[225.04 - 230.52] realize is they're chumming every single
[227.52 - 232.28] day they're chumming inside their body
[230.52 - 235.36] but the difference is they're not
[232.28 - 237.56] chumming so they can capture something
[235.36 - 240.24] they're not chumming inside their body
[237.56 - 243.52] so they can catch something and remove
[240.24 - 246.76] it they're chumming every single day not
[243.52 - 250.92] realizing it they're chumming to fatten
[246.76 - 253.56] things up to feed something to feed some
[250.92 - 257.12] type of creature but it's really not a
[253.56 - 260.24] creature it's a virus it's a pathogen
[257.12 - 262.04] it's bacteria they're chumming every day
[260.24 - 262.88] and they're fattening up the viruses and
[262.04 - 265.40] the
[262.88 - 267.92] bacteria public medical research and
[265.40 - 270.44] science you know what that is that's
[267.92 - 272.76] stuff you see every day art articles out
[270.44 - 274.32] there studies out there or so-called
[272.76 - 276.00] studies cuz a lot of the stuff in the
[274.32 - 278.08] study really doesn't match the article
[276.00 - 281.44] and so forth but you see a lot of stuff
[278.08 - 283.80] out there public medical research and
[281.44 - 286.12] science it's doctors it's medical
[283.80 - 289.56] schools that's public medical research
[286.12 - 291.68] and science well public medical research
[289.56 - 296.16] and science still to this day does not
[291.68 - 298.60] know viruses actually eat they're hungry
[296.16 - 302.92] they love the feed on food they also
[298.60 - 305.80] don't know that viruses are a cell a
[302.92 - 307.88] viral cell it's still in debate public
[305.80 - 313.16] medical research and science thinks it's
[307.88 - 315.68] like a strand of something maybe RNA or
[313.16 - 317.80] something else they'll just make up
[315.68 - 321.00] something too as the years go by to just
[317.80 - 323.36] kind of go along with The Strand or the
[321.00 - 326.60] fact that it's not living or the fact
[323.36 - 328.28] that's not alive or doesn't eat public
[326.60 - 330.84] medical research and science till this
[328.28 - 333.20] day doesn't know what classified medical
[330.84 - 338.92] research and science knows and what is
[333.20 - 340.84] that bugs eat viruses eat public medical
[338.92 - 343.20] research and science believes that
[340.84 - 345.72] viruses are really just genetic
[343.20 - 348.64] information what that means is they're
[345.72 - 351.36] not alive they're not really real
[348.64 - 353.88] they're not a viral cell so to speak
[351.36 - 358.28] that's living they're just this
[353.88 - 361.56] mysterious piece of DNA or RNA a strand
[358.28 - 365.00] of something wrapped up in a tiny ball
[361.56 - 367.12] in some situations basically just
[365.00 - 369.96] something that doesn't really exist but
[367.12 - 372.56] exists how can it do anything how can it
[369.96 - 375.36] be a problem when it's not even real or
[372.56 - 378.88] living classified medical research and
[375.36 - 382.00] science they are wiser they know
[378.88 - 384.00] something different and they laugh at
[382.00 - 386.20] their colleagues the ones in public
[384.00 - 389.60] medical research and science because
[386.20 - 391.16] they know they're in the dark you see
[389.60 - 394.04] it's not that public medical research
[391.16 - 395.96] and science has been in the dark it's
[394.04 - 400.12] just that they've been in the dark for
[395.96 - 402.76] over a 100 years well over 100 years now
[400.12 - 405.16] not just a year or 10 years or in the
[402.76 - 409.08] dark on one thing they've been in the
[405.16 - 411.64] dark about pathogens for over a hundred
[409.08 - 414.68] years classified medical research and
[411.64 - 418.96] science learned a long time ago that
[414.68 - 422.72] viruses other pathogens feed they need
[418.96 - 425.96] feeding to stay alive to keep them alive
[422.72 - 428.88] in a lab to keep them under the
[425.96 - 433.00] microscope they can't just exist and not
[428.88 - 435.60] be fed they can't be supported and still
[433.00 - 437.76] viewed tested and looked at and
[435.60 - 440.96] monitored classified medical research
[437.76 - 443.28] and science learned this a long time ago
[440.96 - 445.68] when they discovered bugs when they saw
[443.28 - 449.28] it under the microscope they saw it in
[445.68 - 450.52] someone's blood they tried to preserve
[449.28 - 453.40] those those
[450.52 - 456.40] organisms they try to preserve those
[453.40 - 459.68] pathogens so they could study them look
[456.40 - 463.04] at them find out what makes them tick
[459.68 - 465.60] they subjected the bugs they saw viruses
[463.04 - 468.44] bacteria to a lot of different things
[465.60 - 471.72] they noticed what would not keep the bug
[468.44 - 474.20] around where the bug would just die and
[471.72 - 478.08] be useless and no longer something they
[474.20 - 481.60] can view or monitor or watch or grow
[478.08 - 485.92] they used Mercury and realized Mercury
[481.60 - 489.08] was a preservative it preserved the bugs
[485.92 - 494.08] kept them alive kept them around but
[489.08 - 496.08] they didn't know how or why it happened
[494.08 - 498.16] they tried a lot of different foods to
[496.08 - 501.24] keep the bugs going to try to
[498.16 - 504.68] proliferate them grow them get them to
[501.24 - 508.76] multiply and there was one food they saw
[504.68 - 510.28] an unusual outcome real productivity and
[508.76 - 513.84] it was egg
[510.28 - 516.52] the egg became the number one food for
[513.84 - 518.16] pathogens and bugs to keep them alive in
[516.52 - 520.92] the classified medical research and
[518.16 - 524.92] science labs and what they discovered
[520.92 - 528.44] was the viruses would feed would fuel
[524.92 - 531.16] themselves with that egg they would eat
[528.44 - 534.92] the egg it kept them alive but more than
[531.16 - 537.84] keeping them alive it kept them growing
[534.92 - 541.80] rapidly so classified medical research
[537.84 - 545.20] and science start at the assembly line
[541.80 - 547.68] the actual pathogen assembly line you're
[545.20 - 549.96] sick today because of what they did over
[547.68 - 553.44] a 100 years ago because of that assembly
[549.96 - 556.16] line that's why you're sick today
[553.44 - 558.68] because you have a bug that they created
[556.16 - 560.72] over a 100 years ago that's why
[558.68 - 562.88] everybody is sick today that's why they
[560.72 - 566.12] have all the chronic fatigue syndrome
[562.88 - 568.40] and the seratic arthritis and the ra and
[566.12 - 569.88] the Ms and so many other different
[568.40 - 572.12] conditions and symptoms
[569.88 - 574.12] it's because of classified medical
[572.12 - 576.64] research and Science and what they did
[574.12 - 579.72] over a hundred years ago creating the
[576.64 - 582.40] bug assembly line classified medical
[579.72 - 585.76] research and science wanted everybody to
[582.40 - 589.08] be sick down the road they wanted people
[585.76 - 593.04] to die and be maimed and be chronically
[589.08 - 594.76] ill forever that was the plan and they
[593.04 - 597.16] wanted public medical research and
[594.76 - 599.00] science to not have a clue and to look
[597.16 - 600.76] like idiots like they did all these
[599.00 - 602.80] decades when someone came to the
[600.76 - 605.24] doctor's office and they didn't know why
[602.80 - 607.96] they were sick classified medical
[605.24 - 611.16] research and science grew viruses docile
[607.96 - 614.20] viruses ones that weren't really a big
[611.16 - 616.96] problem they grew them they reshaped
[614.20 - 619.68] them they mutated them they made them
[616.96 - 622.56] aggressive they fed them they starved
[619.68 - 625.44] them they made them hungry again and
[622.56 - 627.84] they created monsters and they took
[625.44 - 629.96] those pathogenic monsters and they put
[627.84 - 632.40] it in animals they they watched the
[629.96 - 635.16] animals live their life they watched for
[632.40 - 637.60] symptoms and conditions and the animals
[635.16 - 641.20] that showed symptoms conditions and
[637.60 - 644.40] disease they then remov those viruses
[641.20 - 647.56] out of those animals and then stuck them
[644.40 - 649.80] back into other animals and fed them
[647.56 - 652.24] again by feeding the animals what they
[649.80 - 654.92] wanted to feed them they were raising
[652.24 - 657.96] bugs and eggs and they were raising bugs
[654.92 - 660.76] in animals and then back in eggs back
[657.96 - 663.92] into animals back into eggs back into
[660.76 - 665.88] animals until they found animals that
[663.92 - 669.08] were getting really sick and really
[665.88 - 671.28] diseased as the leading animals they
[669.08 - 674.40] were taking the bugs from again they
[671.28 - 676.72] wanted aggressive bugs bugs that did
[674.40 - 680.40] destruction created even long-term
[676.72 - 682.60] sickness created even death at this time
[680.40 - 685.44] over 100 years ago public medical
[682.60 - 688.52] research in science were churning out
[685.44 - 690.76] doctors the doctors were studying
[688.52 - 693.52] patients trying to heal them of their
[690.76 - 696.24] sickness and at the same moment
[693.52 - 699.28] classified medical research and science
[696.24 - 702.24] was playing in biological
[699.28 - 704.24] warfare the past is always forgotten
[702.24 - 705.88] right now social media is all about the
[704.24 - 708.16] present moment it's all about what's
[705.88 - 710.88] happening in the moment not about how we
[708.16 - 713.36] got here how did we get here in this
[710.88 - 715.92] position now classified medical research
[713.36 - 718.88] and science were doing biological
[715.92 - 721.68] warfare well over a 100 years ago they
[718.88 - 724.40] were developing monsters that they
[721.68 - 726.48] planned on getting into humans to make
[724.40 - 729.20] the chronic illness world what it is
[726.48 - 730.64] today and a big part of how classified
[729.20 - 733.60] medical research and science
[730.64 - 737.48] accomplished this was they used animals
[733.60 - 740.60] to Chum they were chumming inside
[737.48 - 743.76] animals once they found out what a
[740.60 - 746.64] pathogen a virus Lov to eat like eggs
[743.76 - 750.00] for example they would feed the eggs to
[746.64 - 751.84] an animal they plac the new virus in
[750.00 - 754.08] once they were chumming chumming with
[751.84 - 756.92] the food that the viruses love to eat
[754.08 - 759.28] and the pathogens love to feed on once
[756.92 - 761.24] they were chumming they would draw blood
[759.28 - 763.76] and they would see an increase of
[761.24 - 767.04] pathogenic material they would see an
[763.76 - 769.20] increase of viral cells once they
[767.04 - 772.16] discovered all the foods that viruses
[769.20 - 774.84] would love to eat and fed on and fuel
[772.16 - 776.84] themselves with then they knew they had
[774.84 - 779.72] something here so then when they
[776.84 - 782.44] released all of these man ufactured
[779.72 - 785.24] viruses out there in the world they knew
[782.44 - 787.44] they're going to be fed move us forward
[785.24 - 789.24] over 100 years and people are feeding
[787.44 - 791.92] their bugs they're feeding their
[789.24 - 794.24] pathogens their viruses their bacteria
[791.92 - 796.76] they're chumming every single day
[794.24 - 798.48] they're chumming for bugs the difference
[796.76 - 800.28] they're not chumming to catch the bug
[798.48 - 803.04] and get it out of the body they're
[800.28 - 806.24] chumming to feed the bug to get the bug
[803.04 - 808.12] stronger to move bugs around the body to
[806.24 - 811.24] get them hungrier for different foods
[808.12 - 814.12] that they love and to make it so they
[811.24 - 816.64] grow at a rapid
[814.12 - 818.68] Pace look at the pig blood what look
[816.64 - 819.68] what happens when it hits the water
[818.68 - 823.60] anything
[819.68 - 827.80] yet who what was that who shark fin here
[823.60 - 830.04] it comes whoa whoa it just took that pig
[827.80 - 833.92] head right
[830.04 - 837.92] down oh my got another one who we got
[833.92 - 840.80] sharks now lots of sharks whoa okay get
[837.92 - 845.44] get the get the spear get the spear gun
[840.80 - 846.88] ready who look look out whoa okay okay
[845.44 - 848.60] just you got the fishing rods out just
[846.88 - 849.80] in case something else is hungry too you
[848.60 - 851.60] never know what you're going to catch
[849.80 - 854.20] right here all right put the fish guts
[851.60 - 856.88] out put the cow guts out put it all out
[854.20 - 859.52] just keep on dumping it in it's like a
[856.88 - 861.12] Feeding Frenzy oh look at that one whoa
[859.52 - 863.20] look out all right all right all right
[861.12 - 864.64] watch out watch out that one almost got
[863.20 - 866.24] you just coming out of the water there
[864.64 - 869.56] just be careful dumping
[866.24 - 871.64] that people have viruses in them they
[869.56 - 874.48] get them from their families their
[871.64 - 876.80] parents pass down from generation to
[874.48 - 880.52] generation that's why the whole genetic
[876.80 - 882.32] thing with oh well I have a person in my
[880.52 - 885.40] family that has the disease so I'm going
[882.32 - 887.92] to have the disease my father had this
[885.40 - 890.24] illness and symptoms so I have it or
[887.92 - 892.12] maybe it skips a generation and then
[890.24 - 894.76] someone else has it in a family line but
[892.12 - 896.84] it's getting passed down passed down but
[894.76 - 900.00] what people don't realize it's viruses
[896.84 - 903.12] and pathogens going back well over a 100
[900.00 - 906.16] years being passed down generation to
[903.12 - 908.68] generation and so these viruses live in
[906.16 - 910.68] our bodies they're there they're sitting
[908.68 - 914.60] dormant many times inside people's
[910.68 - 916.68] livers in their spleen in other organs
[914.60 - 919.00] the liver does hold a lot of different
[916.68 - 922.08] pathogens they could be sleeping it's
[919.00 - 924.64] called dorcy they're dormant they're
[922.08 - 928.12] actually not awakened they're sitting
[924.64 - 931.12] there cells and they're incubating
[928.12 - 934.44] they're alive they're staying preserved
[931.12 - 937.96] but then they can be awakened things can
[934.44 - 941.32] awaken them like chumming when we're
[937.96 - 944.96] chumming when we're consuming foods that
[941.32 - 947.72] awaken these bugs get them out of dorcy
[944.96 - 950.44] sometimes we can eat foods that can sit
[947.72 - 953.60] there and Float around them for years
[950.44 - 957.56] but then one day the bug starts
[953.60 - 960.48] Awakening and it sniffs the chum and it
[957.56 - 963.92] goes for it I want it goes forward it
[960.48 - 966.68] gets an appetite it starts to grow it
[963.92 - 969.60] produces more viral cells and more viral
[966.68 - 971.40] cells and more viral cell toxins and
[969.60 - 973.28] then the chumming takes it to a level
[971.40 - 976.72] where now we're getting
[973.28 - 979.36] sick another thing is catching a bug
[976.72 - 981.76] recently from someone catching a bug
[979.36 - 984.40] from a shopping Carriage the handles on
[981.76 - 988.04] it rubbing your eye catching a bug from
[984.40 - 989.84] a door knob a toilet seat catching a bug
[988.04 - 993.08] from just bodily fluids from somebody
[989.84 - 996.60] else getting new bugs new bugs with
[993.08 - 999.20] appetites new bugs that were feeding in
[996.60 - 1001.84] somebody else's body so somebody else
[999.20 - 1004.52] was chumming they were putting Chum
[1001.84 - 1007.52] inside their body all the time feeding
[1004.52 - 1009.80] those bugs those bugs are used to their
[1007.52 - 1013.04] Chum and as those bugs are sitting
[1009.80 - 1015.24] inside of you looking for food they're
[1013.04 - 1018.28] looking for food they were raised on
[1015.24 - 1020.36] food they like and enjoy so you might be
[1018.28 - 1022.56] somebody that contracted or picked up
[1020.36 - 1025.32] bugs from somebody else or some other
[1022.56 - 1028.20] way and you got these new bugs new
[1025.32 - 1030.52] viruses inside of you they're used to
[1028.20 - 1032.76] somebody else's Chum when they're
[1030.52 - 1035.44] chumming now they're hungry and they
[1032.76 - 1038.20] want the food they were used to so they
[1035.44 - 1041.84] start giving craving messages to the
[1038.20 - 1044.20] person to the new host craving messages
[1041.84 - 1047.04] they want the food they were used to
[1044.20 - 1049.80] that they ate every day this is when
[1047.04 - 1052.40] someone that doesn't eat a lot of eggs
[1049.80 - 1055.00] ends up liking a lot of eggs and eating
[1052.40 - 1057.32] them more they don't usually eat eggs
[1055.00 - 1060.48] they eat them maybe once a month maybe
[1057.32 - 1063.32] once every few weeks maybe once every
[1060.48 - 1065.36] few months but all of a sudden after
[1063.32 - 1067.96] being in a relationship for a while
[1065.36 - 1071.04] being with somebody they contracted bugs
[1067.96 - 1072.72] from or some other Avenue those bugs are
[1071.04 - 1074.88] hungry and they want the food somebody
[1072.72 - 1077.32] else used to eat all the time so then
[1074.88 - 1080.96] the bug starts sending messages
[1077.32 - 1084.24] information leeches out of the bugs they
[1080.96 - 1087.32] excrete hungry hormones those hungry
[1084.24 - 1089.32] hormones float around get to the brain
[1087.32 - 1091.92] and trip up the hunger
[1089.32 - 1093.88] senses somebody that didn't eat a lot of
[1091.92 - 1096.36] eggs and they might have had their own
[1093.88 - 1098.76] bugs in them too but maybe those bugs
[1096.36 - 1101.28] weren't really tuned into eggs and that
[1098.76 - 1103.60] person really wasn't a big egg eater but
[1101.28 - 1105.92] now the new bugs they're getting real
[1103.60 - 1107.88] hungry fast so they're sending those
[1105.92 - 1110.68] signals and then the person's like I'm
[1107.88 - 1113.40] in the mood for eggs now there's a few
[1110.68 - 1115.56] different ways to catch pathogens bugs
[1113.40 - 1117.96] viruses one is blood
[1115.56 - 1119.80] transfusions that's a very popular way
[1117.96 - 1121.04] if someone gets a blood transfusion
[1119.80 - 1122.72] there's a good chance they going to pick
[1121.04 - 1126.48] up a few different new bugs in their
[1122.72 - 1129.32] system another one is public bathrooms
[1126.48 - 1131.80] being careless in them another one is
[1129.32 - 1135.32] shopping handles door knobs that's
[1131.80 - 1138.84] another one too but sex is a big one
[1135.32 - 1141.76] bodily fluid shared during sex out of
[1138.84 - 1144.52] all these ways of getting pathogens sex
[1141.76 - 1147.32] is the most popular it's the most
[1144.52 - 1150.80] popular way and most common way to get a
[1147.32 - 1155.88] pathogen so much so the pathogens rely
[1150.80 - 1157.56] on it viruses and bacteria rely on sex
[1155.88 - 1161.40] viruses have
[1157.56 - 1165.28] information they retain information for
[1161.40 - 1168.16] bugs to be living on past that host
[1165.28 - 1170.72] viruses want bugs out of the host into
[1168.16 - 1174.76] another host host that's one of viruses
[1170.72 - 1177.80] and pathogens goals is to send pathogens
[1174.76 - 1180.88] viruses bugs to another person and then
[1177.80 - 1183.88] to another person that's
[1180.88 - 1186.40] Survival that's the way the virus can be
[1183.88 - 1189.68] guaranteed it's kind is going to survive
[1186.40 - 1192.76] and live beyond that person that host or
[1189.68 - 1195.56] that virus it's a pathogen survival
[1192.76 - 1198.20] mechanism so when people have sex
[1195.56 - 1200.72] intercourse or share bodily fluids it's
[1198.20 - 1203.64] one of the great ways to guarantee that
[1200.72 - 1206.60] survival so when there's a new host with
[1203.64 - 1210.04] new viral cells in them we have to feed
[1206.60 - 1215.20] them now the number one food after
[1210.04 - 1218.68] having sex of any kind are eggs people
[1215.20 - 1220.56] make eggs they do it the next morning or
[1218.68 - 1223.56] they do it late that night or early
[1220.56 - 1225.44] morning or it's the next meal they eat
[1223.56 - 1228.20] but they always have scrambled eggs and
[1225.44 - 1229.92] maybe nowadays one person might have
[1228.20 - 1232.24] something else else they make themselves
[1229.92 - 1235.40] some type of protein smoothie another
[1232.24 - 1237.56] person will do something else but mostly
[1235.40 - 1241.20] and most of the time there's eggs
[1237.56 - 1246.16] involved scrambled eggs top of the list
[1241.20 - 1249.08] it's a postex food it is a feeder it's
[1246.16 - 1253.68] the ultimate chummer chumming it's to
[1249.08 - 1257.52] feed the new viral cells the new viral
[1253.68 - 1259.72] eggs the new viruses it's to feed them
[1257.52 - 1261.76] to make sure they get a strong start and
[1259.72 - 1262.96] they can root and they can have the
[1261.76 - 1265.48] strength to
[1262.96 - 1268.96] travel one of the reasons why people
[1265.48 - 1271.28] fight so hard to defend their eggs is
[1268.96 - 1274.36] because their eggs are keeping the bugs
[1271.28 - 1277.20] happy they're keeping them solid they're
[1274.36 - 1279.08] keeping them strong a lot of people out
[1277.20 - 1281.08] there who have been sick with all kinds
[1279.08 - 1284.04] of different symptoms all kinds of
[1281.08 - 1286.64] different issues fight for their eggs
[1284.04 - 1288.72] like nobody's business and then there's
[1286.64 - 1290.44] people that aren't really sick yet but
[1288.72 - 1293.04] the bugs are dormant and they're there
[1290.44 - 1296.20] and they still need that food to feed
[1293.04 - 1298.16] them to keep them going cuz dormy
[1296.20 - 1299.80] doesn't mean they're totally asleep it
[1298.16 - 1302.04] means they're still feeding but they're
[1299.80 - 1302.92] staying lowkey waiting for a day to make
[1302.04 - 1306.32] their
[1302.92 - 1310.64] break people fight for their eggs like
[1306.32 - 1313.72] no other they will go to the next level
[1310.64 - 1316.28] they will do anything they need to do so
[1313.72 - 1318.40] someone lays off of them about their
[1316.28 - 1320.32] eggs you could tell them to stay away
[1318.40 - 1321.88] from from meat they'll be fine with that
[1320.32 - 1323.52] they'll go through their phases you
[1321.88 - 1325.20] could tell them to stay away from Beans
[1323.52 - 1328.04] they'll go through their phases you can
[1325.20 - 1330.56] tell them to stay away from dairy milk
[1328.04 - 1332.24] butter they'll go through their phases
[1330.56 - 1334.24] and they'll stay away from it they'll
[1332.24 - 1337.60] try it you tell them to stay away from
[1334.24 - 1340.52] eggs and it's a fight it's
[1337.60 - 1342.60] Fierce you can mention hey go off a
[1340.52 - 1344.08] gluten that would be a good idea and
[1342.60 - 1345.96] they would be like you're right you're
[1344.08 - 1347.36] right I should stay away from gluten
[1345.96 - 1349.40] it's not good that I'm getting all this
[1347.36 - 1351.64] gluten in me but then then you tell them
[1349.40 - 1354.56] stay away from eggs and they'll look at
[1351.64 - 1357.00] you and they'll get angry they'll hate
[1354.56 - 1359.44] you one of the first things they'll say
[1357.00 - 1362.08] is what do I eat then what am I going to
[1359.44 - 1364.60] eat I have nothing to eat now what am I
[1362.08 - 1368.28] going to do to replace my eggs what can
[1364.60 - 1371.24] I get what can I eat tell me now I
[1368.28 - 1373.96] learned long ago that eggs were a tough
[1371.24 - 1376.60] one for people that getting them off of
[1373.96 - 1378.76] eggs could be almost impossible no
[1376.60 - 1382.20] matter how sick they were they going to
[1378.76 - 1386.64] have 100 symptoms and when you bring up
[1382.20 - 1389.04] the eggs they freeze up eggs are scary
[1386.64 - 1391.32] removing them for so many people and I
[1389.04 - 1393.12] knew this I knew that there's
[1391.32 - 1395.88] possibilities of keeping the eggs in
[1393.12 - 1397.76] there if we need to do other things and
[1395.88 - 1401.76] keep on moving forward until their Free
[1397.76 - 1403.76] Will got strong enough to realize whoa
[1401.76 - 1406.08] I'm feeling better CU of this maybe if I
[1403.76 - 1409.00] take out the eggs I could really move
[1406.08 - 1411.96] forward almost 25 years ago
[1409.00 - 1415.08] my wife and I started an organic store
[1411.96 - 1418.36] it was the first organic and wild food
[1415.08 - 1420.36] store in the United States and back then
[1418.36 - 1423.04] there wasn't such thing there wasn't
[1420.36 - 1426.16] just an all organic health food store
[1423.04 - 1428.60] with wild Foods included instead it was
[1426.16 - 1428.60] mostly
[1438.40 - 1443.76] prod departments had very few options
[1441.48 - 1447.16] that were organic even in the best
[1443.76 - 1449.80] stores around in our prodest department
[1447.16 - 1452.92] was the first organic produce department
[1449.80 - 1456.08] the first one to have 100% organic
[1452.92 - 1459.24] produce in it the store was the first of
[1456.08 - 1461.68] its kind the other thing we did was we
[1459.24 - 1464.20] never put a markup on the organic
[1461.68 - 1467.32] produce the produce department was at
[1464.20 - 1469.28] Cost it's whatever we spent and then
[1467.32 - 1472.08] that's what we would charge
[1469.28 - 1475.28] we wanted people to be able to afford
[1472.08 - 1476.68] organic produce now downstairs on the
[1475.28 - 1480.60] other side of the building that the
[1476.68 - 1482.96] store was in I had my office it was the
[1480.60 - 1486.76] medical medium office and people
[1482.96 - 1488.68] worldwide came to see me in that office
[1486.76 - 1490.76] people traveled from all the different
[1488.68 - 1493.20] countries in the world they traveled
[1490.76 - 1496.88] from around the United States to see me
[1493.20 - 1498.92] in person in that office to find answers
[1496.88 - 1502.36] and to have me work and help help their
[1498.92 - 1505.32] doctors with discoveries to what was
[1502.36 - 1507.80] wrong after somebody's appointment we
[1505.32 - 1509.56] would go upstairs to the store and
[1507.80 - 1512.04] people would want to get things they
[1509.56 - 1514.96] needed to help them heal so we would
[1512.04 - 1518.28] walk around we would go into the produce
[1514.96 - 1520.08] department and people would learn about
[1518.28 - 1522.92] organic produce for the first time in
[1520.08 - 1525.36] their life many of them and they would
[1522.92 - 1527.60] know what foods were good for them they
[1525.36 - 1530.96] would learn for the first time what to
[1527.60 - 1534.32] eat to help them heal and what they
[1530.96 - 1537.32] would ask all the time was can I eat
[1534.32 - 1540.28] eggs can I still have eggs in my diet
[1537.32 - 1541.36] and I would say of course you can but CU
[1540.28 - 1543.68] you're suffering with all these
[1541.36 - 1546.52] different conditions it's best not to
[1543.68 - 1549.16] use those eggs to feed all the bugs the
[1546.52 - 1551.20] very things behind your symptoms a lot
[1549.16 - 1554.44] of people would panic and they would ask
[1551.20 - 1556.72] me can you get eggs in the store can you
[1554.44 - 1559.68] get organic eggs in the store since the
[1556.72 - 1562.80] store's organic and I said yes so we
[1559.68 - 1565.12] stocked eggs in the store for people so
[1562.80 - 1567.40] we stocked the best eggs you can find at
[1565.12 - 1569.56] the time in the store for people so they
[1567.40 - 1571.48] had an option and like I've always said
[1569.56 - 1573.96] and still till this day if you're going
[1571.48 - 1576.48] to eat eggs eat the best ones you can
[1573.96 - 1578.40] find if you raise them in your backyard
[1576.48 - 1581.28] that's the ones you eat they're the best
[1578.40 - 1584.08] ones you can find and there were local
[1581.28 - 1586.72] small farms that were raising chickens
[1584.08 - 1588.68] they were free range organic they were
[1586.72 - 1591.08] feeding these chickens all or organic
[1588.68 - 1593.36] food they would come to us and say will
[1591.08 - 1595.36] you take our eggs will you stock them in
[1593.36 - 1597.60] the store so people can get them and we
[1595.36 - 1599.76] said yes of course because these are the
[1597.60 - 1605.24] best eggs that are out there that we can
[1599.76 - 1607.32] find local fresh free range organic eggs
[1605.24 - 1609.80] because as I always said before I'm not
[1607.32 - 1611.92] the food police I'm not telling you
[1609.80 - 1614.40] don't eat this and don't eat that I'm
[1611.92 - 1616.84] telling you if you have a pathogen or a
[1614.40 - 1618.88] bug you're unwell and sick you have
[1616.84 - 1621.32] these options just just like in the
[1618.88 - 1623.32] medical medium anti-bug cleanse you can
[1621.32 - 1626.28] pick your level if you need to keep eggs
[1623.32 - 1628.20] in for now you keep eggs in for now you
[1626.28 - 1630.08] can customize it for yourself you can
[1628.20 - 1631.84] take the information and use it in the
[1630.08 - 1633.96] way you need to use it and then
[1631.84 - 1636.00] eventually you can go to another level
[1633.96 - 1638.96] and say okay I'm ready to get rid of
[1636.00 - 1641.60] eggs for now every day at the store we
[1638.96 - 1643.36] would get requests they would phone in
[1641.60 - 1645.88] they would show up at the store people
[1643.36 - 1647.84] wanted eggs so we would get the best
[1645.88 - 1650.40] eggs for them because they were going to
[1647.84 - 1653.28] getg eggs somewhere else anyway and get
[1650.40 - 1655.64] a bad egg we wanted to at least offer
[1653.28 - 1657.24] them something they were hungry for
[1655.64 - 1659.48] something they wanted something they
[1657.24 - 1660.28] cared about Good Health they wanted the
[1659.48 - 1663.28] best
[1660.28 - 1665.68] eggs Spirit of compassion and I always
[1663.28 - 1668.84] believe knowledge is power true
[1665.68 - 1672.40] knowledge the truth is power it's
[1668.84 - 1674.72] empowering so I put a sign next to the
[1672.40 - 1677.68] eggs I put a sign right on the
[1674.72 - 1678.88] refrigerator and it said eat at your own
[1677.68 - 1682.16] risk
[1678.88 - 1684.72] eggs feed pathogens they feed viruses
[1682.16 - 1686.76] and bacteria inside the body if you're
[1684.72 - 1690.28] someone struggling with an illness or a
[1686.76 - 1693.52] symptom beware this could actually bring
[1690.28 - 1696.32] it about cause a future flare and take
[1693.52 - 1698.72] you to a place of poor health some
[1696.32 - 1701.08] people were confused by this they did
[1698.72 - 1703.84] not know what this meant remember this
[1701.08 - 1706.16] is 25 years ago keep in mind now people
[1703.84 - 1707.72] don't know what this means today and
[1706.16 - 1709.60] there are a lot of people out there that
[1707.72 - 1712.36] don't even believe in viruses today at
[1709.60 - 1715.08] all even after covid and this was the
[1712.36 - 1717.64] Dark Ages this was 25 years ago in the
[1715.08 - 1719.84] health movement where were you 25 years
[1717.64 - 1721.80] ago there are lots of different doctors
[1719.84 - 1723.88] now on social media that are like 30
[1721.80 - 1726.64] years old they were 5 years old when
[1723.88 - 1729.28] this was going on there are influencers
[1726.64 - 1731.08] now and podcast doctors and health
[1729.28 - 1733.68] people on social that were in
[1731.08 - 1736.16] kindergarten when this was happening or
[1733.68 - 1738.72] not even born yet so let's get back to
[1736.16 - 1741.36] the sign that was posted on the fridge
[1738.72 - 1743.08] in the store where the eggs were a
[1741.36 - 1745.16] couple people were really worried they
[1743.08 - 1747.64] didn't know what it meant they didn't
[1745.16 - 1749.76] understand pathogens or eggs with
[1747.64 - 1751.80] pathogens or anything of the sort so
[1749.76 - 1754.68] somebody thought maybe the eggs in the
[1751.80 - 1757.00] refrigerator actually have salmonella
[1754.68 - 1759.00] one day our store manager was over by
[1757.00 - 1761.80] the egg Department over there and was
[1759.00 - 1763.44] standing there talking to somebody the
[1761.80 - 1765.84] person they were talking to was a state
[1763.44 - 1768.28] official as a health inspector he was
[1765.84 - 1771.52] reading the sign and asking questions
[1768.28 - 1774.64] about it our manager explained the whole
[1771.52 - 1777.80] thing about what it meant he laughed and
[1774.64 - 1780.20] he walked out for decades I've been a
[1777.80 - 1782.80] messenger a messenger of information
[1780.20 - 1786.24] that's life-changing it's changed Health
[1782.80 - 1789.12] itself out there I put up with a lot and
[1786.24 - 1792.28] over the years eggs has been a big one
[1789.12 - 1794.64] I've taken a lot of because of eggs
[1792.28 - 1797.68] and remember I think I said this all the
[1794.64 - 1799.00] way back many many years ago publicly
[1797.68 - 1801.76] that egg eggs were my favorite when I
[1799.00 - 1804.48] was a kid and that my dream was to have
[1801.76 - 1806.64] an egg Shack a restaurant a little egg
[1804.48 - 1809.00] Shack where I made eggs in all kinds of
[1806.64 - 1812.44] different ways for people sunyside up
[1809.00 - 1815.08] poached fried scrambled omelets
[1812.44 - 1817.76] everything I thought it was the greatest
[1815.08 - 1820.20] but messaging the truth about chronic
[1817.76 - 1822.76] illness is the most important getting
[1820.20 - 1825.40] people better recovering them getting
[1822.76 - 1828.12] their lives back getting them out of
[1825.40 - 1831.64] wheelchairs getting them back to life
[1828.12 - 1834.72] back to work moving them forward healing
[1831.64 - 1837.44] them it's the most important thing keep
[1834.72 - 1841.72] in mind that 25 years ago that wasn't a
[1837.44 - 1843.72] medical medium only store this was a
[1841.72 - 1846.64] health food store that was servicing not
[1843.72 - 1850.04] only the area but around the whole state
[1846.64 - 1853.20] and Beyond it was a grocery store but an
[1850.04 - 1855.56] organic health food market grocery store
[1853.20 - 1858.76] and that means it was for everybody who
[1855.56 - 1860.08] needed something it wasn't a iCal medium
[1858.76 - 1863.00] only
[1860.08 - 1865.64] store I want you to know I understand
[1863.00 - 1867.88] how hard it is it's not easy when you
[1865.64 - 1870.16] love a food or have an attachment to a
[1867.88 - 1872.12] food especially since it could go back
[1870.16 - 1874.44] to when you were a child when your
[1872.12 - 1876.92] mother made you eggs your grandfather
[1874.44 - 1879.20] made you eggs maybe a time where you
[1876.92 - 1881.80] actually had eggs with somebody that you
[1879.20 - 1885.52] love and care about eggs get attached to
[1881.80 - 1888.80] our soul soul experiences these are
[1885.52 - 1892.08] loving experiences more experien es of
[1888.80 - 1894.24] comfort and it's a comfort food and I'm
[1892.08 - 1896.92] not judging anyone and I've never been
[1894.24 - 1899.72] hard on anyone about eggs I've only been
[1896.92 - 1901.48] a messenger about the information of
[1899.72 - 1904.64] what classified medical research and
[1901.48 - 1907.64] science has done to our eggs and how
[1904.64 - 1909.72] they manipulated them and how they fed
[1907.64 - 1912.28] them to pathogens and got those
[1909.72 - 1914.60] pathogens to become little monsters and
[1912.28 - 1917.04] then they released those little monsters
[1914.60 - 1918.36] onto the public over time so that people
[1917.04 - 1920.68] would contract
[1918.36 - 1923.00] those very little monsters and those
[1920.68 - 1925.40] little pathogens those viruses those
[1923.00 - 1928.52] bacteria those monsters they're now
[1925.40 - 1931.20] feeding on Chum just like the classified
[1928.52 - 1933.56] medical research and science want it to
[1931.20 - 1936.56] happen they wanted people to be
[1933.56 - 1939.24] oblivious and just eat whatever and feed
[1936.56 - 1941.40] the bugs but eggs aren't the only food
[1939.24 - 1944.48] classified medical research and science
[1941.40 - 1948.04] fed to bugs they fed dairy products to
[1944.48 - 1951.72] bugs they fed gluten to bugs they fed
[1948.04 - 1954.12] corn to bugs they fed soy to bugs milk
[1951.72 - 1956.88] cheese and butter and then there's toxic
[1954.12 - 1959.32] heavy metals they fed bugs toxic heavy
[1956.88 - 1961.60] metals they mixed the metals in with the
[1959.32 - 1964.16] favorite foods the bugs loved they mixed
[1961.60 - 1967.48] Metals in with eggs with milk with
[1964.16 - 1970.80] cheese with butter with gluten the goal
[1967.48 - 1973.40] was for people to Chum their bugs so
[1970.80 - 1975.60] anytime somebody ate some of these Foods
[1973.40 - 1978.48] these very foods that were fed to these
[1975.60 - 1981.00] pathogens long long ago and any time
[1978.48 - 1983.36] somebody ate them they were chumming
[1981.00 - 1985.24] chumming their bugs that means bugs that
[1983.36 - 1988.32] were sitting inside of them were getting
[1985.24 - 1990.92] fed so someday they can rise up and
[1988.32 - 1993.88] cause a problem the last thing someone
[1990.92 - 1995.36] needs is a Feeding Frenzy especially if
[1993.88 - 1998.44] they're already sick with chronic
[1995.36 - 2001.52] illness they weren't told what to avoid
[1998.44 - 2003.60] they weren't taught so they didn't know
[2001.52 - 2005.64] and they don't know and classified
[2003.60 - 2008.84] medical research and science will never
[2005.64 - 2012.64] say a word they want people to not know
[2008.84 - 2015.28] they want people to feed their
[2012.64 - 2017.32] bugs sharks are splashing around
[2015.28 - 2020.36] everywhere oh my god oh look at that big
[2017.32 - 2023.76] one look how huge it is wait a minute
[2020.36 - 2027.36] watch out watch out oh the shark just B

[2027.36 - 2033.84] are we going to do he's gushing blood
[2031.00 - 2036.96] everywhere this was a bad idea I guess
[2033.84 - 2038.88] he's just used his Chum I don't know
[2036.96 - 2042.16] wait a minute don't throw in you're
[2038.88 - 2045.00] trying to use him as Chum now too I mean
[2042.16 - 2046.96] it's a doggy dog

[2046.96 - 2053.12] evil it's
[2049.00 - 2058.04] sick classified medicine games played on
[2053.12 - 2059.36] the people who fall for the tricks doing
[2058.04 - 2063.56] bad to
[2059.36 - 2065.40] humankind instead of good and allowing
[2063.56 - 2070.04] the Holy Light to
[2065.40 - 2074.40] shine the papete teers at the top so
[2070.04 - 2079.64] many of them now control the gov control
[2074.40 - 2083.68] apps control the Ops so much doing wrong
[2079.64 - 2087.40] will they ever stop it's on purpose to
[2083.68 - 2090.92] break down the mind and hurt the future
[2087.40 - 2094.44] billions of lives causing them to fold
[2090.92 - 2097.32] early in life destroying
[2094.44 - 2098.44] Bloodlines listen up there's so much
[2097.32 - 2103.00] more to
[2098.44 - 2106.48] unwind Sinister bastards they are look
[2103.00 - 2110.36] how far they go to let the monsters out
[2106.48 - 2113.40] in the park to pray on the masses
[2110.36 - 2116.92] setting traps so the innocent beings get
[2113.40 - 2117.96] sicker fastest they only want hopeless
[2116.92 - 2120.80] Health
[2117.96 - 2123.36] disasters and the influencers are
[2120.80 - 2126.04] helping the darkness and doing Evil's
[2123.36 - 2128.84] bidding to make it go even
[2126.04 - 2132.60] faster they don't know it but they're
[2128.84 - 2133.48] working for the dark lord beazel buug
[2132.60 - 2137.00] the
[2133.48 - 2139.52] master over a 100 years ago they grew
[2137.00 - 2140.92] pathogens in an egg and they took the
[2139.52 - 2144.48] baby chick's
[2140.92 - 2147.72] Soul the bugs ate the undeveloped
[2144.48 - 2151.44] protein and gained a permanent worldwide
[2147.72 - 2154.32] role after enough bugs were cuddled and
[2151.44 - 2156.32] collected they placed them in vials and
[2154.32 - 2157.84] found different ways to get people
[2156.32 - 2162.04] infected
[2157.84 - 2165.80] the true battle of chronic illness and
[2162.04 - 2168.32] what really happened will stay hidden in
