00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
on here and made mango ice cream

190
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,759
basically mango sorbet which is really

191
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,440
incredible right so i'm excited about

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,240
this in fact

193
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
i would love some

194
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,759
amazing incredible

195
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,199
add some applesauce right here so let's

196
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,199
move on let's make some more things

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,839
so i got my applesauce

198
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,279
i'm just not going to have pork chops

199
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
with it okay so i'm not going to make

200
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,200
pork chops

201
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,519
that's not a wise thing to do is to have

202
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,120
pork chops

203
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,720
pork chops and applesauce you don't want

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,160
to put those that's a terrible

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
combination you won't have the

206
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
applesauce you don't want to have the

207
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
pork chops

208
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,640
all right

209
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
unless you want a heart attack if you

210
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,839
want a heart attack have the pork

211
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,920
it's like if we want a heart attack we

212
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,720
have the pork and then we can get a

213
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,240
heart attack down the road

214
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
if you don't want a heart attack stay

215
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,320
away from the pork

216
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
kathy why does some produce smell like

217
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,279
perfume lately

218
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,480
kathy

219
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,560
because everybody's wearing perfume

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
and they're going and they're in the

221
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,080
store and they go in there fresh in the

222
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
morning and they got their perfume all

223
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,320
over them and they're touching

224
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,560
everything and they're wiping perfume on

225
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
everything that's why including people

226
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,640
who work in the grocery store they're

227
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
loaded with perfume

228
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,959
every now and then i get a checkout

229
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
person right check out persons loaded

230
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,440
with perfume and they get perfume on

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,920
every single item so that by time you

232
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
got your bags and you go in your car you

233
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920

252
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
perfume stuff the worst

253
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
here's the funny thing they're making

254
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
air fresheners now that activate

255
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,320
when you

256
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,120
touch them

257
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,519
so that they smell for centuries like

258
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,600
they smell forever they make air

259
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,880

260
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,040

so this is the celery end cap i'm gonna

406
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,759
put a little more cilantro in there

407
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,959
all right

408
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,959
put another celery stick in there

409
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,600
making celery cilantro juice

410
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
good to see you guys

411
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,079
so we're doing

412
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
making a little bit of cilantro

413
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
celery juice so let's do this now

414
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:52,320
this is a leafy green but it's an herb

415
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,800
celery is an herb what you're witnessing

416
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
right now is herbal medicine

417
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,959
so you're witnessing herbal medicine

418
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
right here

419
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,120
that's what this is so you have to keep

420
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
that in mind

421
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,120
when you're doing this you're making

422
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,799
herbal medicine

423
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,439
when you're combining now here's how it

424
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,079
works celery juice is best on its own

425
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,160
for celery to do what it does right

426
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,799
so we're making instead of different

427
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,000
kind of herbal juice we're doing a

428
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,439
cilantro juice and we're adding

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,959
celery as a carrier

430
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,760
that's what we're doing

431
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,960
so we're making a cilantro juice

432
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,960
but adding celery as a carrier

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,240
we're doing a different kind of herbal

434
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,039
medicine technique with this juicer this

435
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,039
is what we're doing

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,840
right

437
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,280
adding a little bit of a lot of cilantro

438
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,280
we're making a very strong

439
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
pretty interesting

440
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,080
there we go

441
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,080
we have very wet cilantro

442
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,520
okay

443
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
all right so here we go

444
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,480
so we have a really really potent

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,880
very potent juice right here okay you're

446
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,840
looking at a cilantro

447
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
celery juice now the pulp in in the mmm

448
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,400
1500

449
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,120
is much drier than other juicers out

450
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,520
there and the reason why this rope is

451
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,320
dryer is because it has that end cap on

452
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
it that that you know saves us money

453
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
because you get to squeeze so much juice

454
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,679
out there so this is the mm-1500

455
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,200
check it out link is in the description

456
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,400
you guys link is in the profile so

457
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,280
that's the that's the rope right here

458
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,520
and

459
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,919
it's drier

460
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,840
than other juicers

461
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,760
that pulp is nice and dry and that's the

462
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,480
whole point it's not soaking wet down

463
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,400
here where you have juice in your pulp

464
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,880
dish right you know that's the problem

465
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,480
because what happens is in other juicers

466
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,280
when you take the pulp out i want to

467
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,840
show you this in other juicers you see

468
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
juice at the bottom right you don't see

469
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,320
juice at the bottom see i took the pulp

470
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,880
out you're not looking at juice see i'm

471
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,000
not pouring juice that's just pulp fiber

472
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,480
there i'm not pouring juice out of my

473
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,720
container and see what happens is with

474
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,559
the other juicers out there you end up

475
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
pouring juice

476
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
out of your your pulp container you see

477
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
that and i'm trying to show you guys in

478
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,799
the close-up you guys on tick tock and

479
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
telegram you might not be able to see as

480
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,200
good right so that's the difference so

481
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,799
what i love about the mm

482
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,440
1500

483
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,679
and of course the 900 you're not doing

484
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,679
that

485
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,480
all right so we have a really potent

486
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,760
juice on our hands right now

487
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,720

488
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,720

going to strain it

490
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
right here

491
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,840

492
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,840

there

496
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,679
so i'm just showing this juice really

497
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120

499
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,360

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,840
you're somebody with some kind of gastro

561
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,360
pro you have gastric problems you've got

562
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,559
intestinal tract problems maybe you're

563
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,840
somebody with all kinds of issues with

564
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,400
um intestinal issues inflammation maybe

565
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,320
you got celiac crohn's colitis ibs

566
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,720
whatever is happening there or maybe you

567
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,120
just have cramps and gastritis and

568
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,000
problems the pea hummus is a much easier

569
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,799
food than bean hummus

570
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
so pea hummus is easier on the system

571
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,640
than bean hummus easier in the system

572
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,520
than chickpeas and garbanzo beans

573
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,039
and black beans that's hard for a lot of

574
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,799
people and they have gastric distress

575
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,080

637
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,520

639
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,520
hummus i'm going to put some garlic in

640
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,000
here

641
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
this way everybody thinks i smell really

642
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,440
bad

643
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,760
from garlic breath really bad garlic

644
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,760
breath

645
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,120
if you eat garlic in the household make

646
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
sure you like somehow sneak some garlic

647
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,919
in the other people's foods

648
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,919
so that they won't know that you smell

649
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,320
like garlic really bad they won't know

650
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,440
it because they are smelling their own

651
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,600
garlic

652
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,000
from their own breath so then they can't

653
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,559
smell it off of you so you actually have

654
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
to kind of like slip garlic in anybody's

655
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,400

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,400
deposits in our brain that's what msg

935
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
does and then we short circuit later on

936
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,720
and when you get an mri when you're 50

937
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
60 years old and the doctor says we

938
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,960
don't know what we see we see something

939
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,280
in your brain and that's an msg deposit

940
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,200
because it builds up inside the brain

941
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,960
and it stays there forever so

942
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,960
in when it comes down to nut milks every

943
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,599
time i'm in the store i'm just looking

944
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,440

987

991
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,000
cashew butter

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,640
all right

993
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,599
guys making cashew butter

994
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,280
so these are just lightly rinsed they're

995
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,560
not soaked when you make your nut

996
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,800
butters don't soak them

997
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,240
don't soak your nuts when you're making

998
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,240
your nut butters

999
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
okay

1000
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,560
so i'm trying to keep consistency

1001
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,880
dropping them in

1002
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,800
so i can get these beautiful

1003
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,200
see those beautiful pieces of nut butter

1004
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,200
there now listen this is critical to

1005
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,319
know

1006
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,599
nut butters in the store no matter how

1007
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,680
organic or healthy they are they add oil

1008
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,160
oil that's not even from the nuts

1009
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,880
they're using it could be the same type

1010
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,800
of like nut oil but it's not even from

1011
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,640
the nuts that they use it's like you

1012
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,000
have a nut oil from a different part of

1013
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,760
the planet some cheap nut oil and then

1014
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,640
you have the nuts that you use and then

1015
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,640
they mix it it's almost like it's it's

1016
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,880
kind of almost like dark

1017
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,599
when you think about it it's not a great

1018
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,520
practice so what i like doing is real

1019
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:25,680
nut butters are not supposed to be

1020
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,839
filled with oil and grease

1021
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,440
this is really important to know i'm

1022
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,440
just being honest here about how it

1023
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,000
works in the industry the only problem

1024
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,359
is if i make fun or not make fun if i

1025
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,160
point out

1026
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,880
problems in the nut butter industry

1027
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,640
then i'll have more

1028
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,760
people in the industry that hate on

1029
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,680
medical medium what's interesting it's

1030
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,280
is what happens is when you point all

1031
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,839
the stuff out

1032
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,920
people like to protect their interests

1033
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,480
and everything and then they just like

1034
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,040
send out the dogs man

1035
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,920
they send out the dogs i can't tell you

1036
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,560
how

1037
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,560
much crap i have to deal with

1038
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,079
do you write on the package which oil

1039
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,560
they add do they write in the package no

1040
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,560
they don't

1041
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,599
they don't

1042
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,960
they don't have to

1043
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,160
food in food and drug administration

1044
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,920
whatever all the different they don't

1045
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,720
have to

1046
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,160
okay so that's that's the cashew butter

1047
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,960
right here so let me just show you right

1048
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,880
here

1049
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,960
that's the cashew butter it comes out

1050
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,040
and these these beautiful like cheese

1051
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,160
sticks right

1052
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,160
so

1053
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,560
i'm just trying to say to you guys which

1054
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:36,319
is really important that even if they

1055
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:39,200
add cashew oil it's not even the same

1056
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,760
oil from the cashews they used so even

1057
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,880
if a nut butter company says we use the

1058
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,119
finest cashews sourced on the planet

1059
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,839
like we use the finest cashews there

1060
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,720
ever was on the planet in our homemade

1061
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,800
farms cashew butter and they have a cute

1062
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,000
little picture on their cashew thing and

1063
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,560
you're in the store you're in whole

1064
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,760
foods or somewhere and you buy it

1065
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,400
just so you know the cashew oil that

1066
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,119
they put in there is not the cashews

1067
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,280
they use they used a cheaper oil

1068
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,359
somewhere else that was on another place

1069
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,599
that they bought bulk and they mixed it

1070
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,680
in that's why you get all that oil in

1071
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,640
your nut butters so you have all that

1072
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,240
oil in there that's just it's like

1073
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,760
some crooked going down so

1074
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,040
and i'm not trying

1075
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,640
i'm sure i'm going to get now you know

1076
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,240
going to get more heat

1077
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,520
but

1078
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,839
it's like you either protect the

1079
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,599
chronically ill or you protect yourself

1080
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,200
protect a chronic allele or protect

1081
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,480
yourself what i notice people do out

1082
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,000
there in the health industry all the

1083
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,280
gurus they protect themselves they don't

1084
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,359
give up about the chronic leel

1085
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,720
all the people in all the gurus you see

1086
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,839
i could name them

1087
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,839
it's like doctor

1088
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,640
all these guys they don't give up

1089
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,319
about anybody

1090
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,119
they don't they care about their bank

1091
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:07,040
accounts and their popularity and their

1092
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,520
advertisements

1093
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,560
that's all they give up about

1094
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,359
and then

1095
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,520
when it comes down to like so with

1096
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,520
medical medium if anybody's new here if

1097
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,480
you want to sum up medical medium in

1098
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,480
just one sentence

1099
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,880
if you want to i don't know if we can

1100
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,480
but if you wanted to

1101
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,960
he cares about the chronically ill and

1102
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,720
doesn't care about himself

1103
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,359
unfortunately i guess maybe that's

1104
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,800
really bad that's bad

1105
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,560
it's like

1106
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,079
the plumber's toilet doesn't work

1107
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,640
but the plumber makes sure that

1108
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,480
everybody else's toilet works but the

1109
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,040
plumber's toilet doesn't work so the

1110
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,839
plumber's wife has a clogged up toilet

1111
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,880
right

1112
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,640
well

1113
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,880
i don't know or whatever it's like

1114
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,960
medical medium doesn't care about

1115
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,640
you know himself

in the jar that's the whole point you

1133
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,079
can press them down in the jar so you

1134
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,560

1135
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,160

i still run into people that don't know

1223
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,640

00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,119
is the number that actually that the

1341
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,480
light

1342
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,359
depends on

1343
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,440
in order to battle evil

1344
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,680
i'm just telling you right now one one

1345
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,599
one only means three three is the

1346
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,760
beginning of something but it doesn't

1347
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,079
mean it's that powerful

1348
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,760
one four four

1349
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,520
okay

1350
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,480
is a nine

1351
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,240
but one four four is a holy number

1352
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,319
and it works only for the light and

1353
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,280
that's used as a tool to battle darkness

1354
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,280
but nobody knows that

1355
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,920
but

1356
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,599
how are they going to know that

1357
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,200

information but they'll take it now and

1360
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,960

1361
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,640
