[0.00 - 3.04] okay the medical media morning cleanse
[1.44 - 5.60] challenge
[3.04 - 7.04] and hope you guys are hanging in there
[5.60 - 8.24] keeping the fats out in the morning at
[7.04 - 10.24] least right
[8.24 - 12.08] so you can cleanse because you can't
[10.24 - 13.44] cleanse you can't get rid of it you
[12.08 - 15.12] can't get rid of the poisons you can't
[13.44 - 17.52] get rid of toxins
[15.12 - 19.44] you can't get rid of anything unless you
[17.52 - 21.60] keep the fats out in the morning and
[19.44 - 23.52] then when you bring in the powerful
[21.60 - 25.04] healing tools
[23.52 - 27.84] like the celery juice and the lemon
[25.04 - 28.48] water then you're really getting the
[27.84 - 31.44] stuff
[28.48 - 32.88] out and then you're de-aging your
[31.44 - 37.28] anti-aging for
[32.88 - 40.80] real not some bogus anti-aging
[37.28 - 44.00] theoretical supplement from some scammer
[40.80 - 46.24] and some you know whatever
[44.00 - 48.00] infomercial out there mlm companies
[46.24 - 49.92] saying here's an anti-aging
[48.00 - 51.20] supplement and everybody's eating their
[49.92 - 54.72] bacon in the morning
[51.20 - 57.04] and taking their anti-aging supplement
[54.72 - 58.00] it's not like that this is the real deal
[57.04 - 59.28] that's what this stuff is
[58.00 - 61.36] good to see you guys are live on tick
[59.28 - 63.28] tock live on youtube live on facebook
[61.36 - 64.88] lava clubhouse
[63.28 - 66.72] excited that we're here i'm making the
[64.88 - 69.20] potato skillet
[66.72 - 71.44] because you can do a fat free potato
[69.20 - 75.28] skillet it's like hash browns
[71.44 - 79.36] with no insulin resistance going
[75.28 - 81.84] on you guys gonna talk about salicylates
[79.36 - 82.96] have you heard about salicylate some
[81.84 - 85.44] people say
[82.96 - 87.44] i'm really sick you know and it's
[85.44 - 89.52] because it salicylates
[87.44 - 90.56] salicylates in food so i'm trying to
[89.52 - 92.64] stay away from
[90.56 - 94.96] all these different foods because the
[92.64 - 95.76] salicylates it's like that's how people
[94.96 - 97.68] get
[95.76 - 99.44] tricked out there by trends that
[97.68 - 100.40] actually don't make any sense whatsoever
[99.44 - 101.84] and don't exist
[100.40 - 103.60] the reason why someone's got chronic
[101.84 - 106.00] sinusitis
[103.60 - 108.08] and they got phlegm in their lungs and
[106.00 - 110.24] they don't feel good and there's there
[108.08 - 111.76] they got utis and stomach problems and
[110.24 - 113.44] digestive problems and bloat and all
[111.76 - 116.56] this other stuff
[113.44 - 118.32] is not because of salicylates not
[116.56 - 120.48] because of oxalates not because of
[118.32 - 123.76] lectins and that's the trick it's like
[120.48 - 126.24] come out with the next bs thing so we
[123.76 - 128.24] can infomercial the crap out of people
[126.24 - 129.92] and mlm the crap out of people
[128.24 - 131.44] and make sure they buy our lectin
[129.92 - 132.48] supplements make sure they buy our
[131.44 - 134.08] salicylates
[132.48 - 136.16] salicylate supplements make sure they
[134.08 - 138.00] buy oxalate supplements
[136.16 - 139.36] make sure they buy all this garbage and
[138.00 - 141.20] stay sick
[139.36 - 142.72] it's the greatest scam and that's the
[141.20 - 145.44] true snake oil
[142.72 - 147.12] in the industry out there collagen
[145.44 - 148.88] that's another snake oil in this
[147.12 - 151.76] industry so there's tons of that real
[148.88 - 153.44] snake oil out there like real snake oil
[151.76 - 156.24] salicylate supplements lectin
[153.44 - 157.36] supplements collagen supplements right
[156.24 - 159.60] and so that's what you guys have
[157.36 - 161.12] probably already been around or you know
[159.60 - 163.76] been around the merry-go-round with
[161.12 - 165.76] right you guys good to see you guys

[179.44 - 182.96] skillet let me get the pan hot too
[182.08 - 184.32] because
[182.96 - 186.32] i know that some of you guys are like
[184.32 - 187.52] what am i going to eat the heavy metal
[186.32 - 189.04] detox smoothie
[187.52 - 190.80] for sure you know and that's what people
[189.04 - 192.32] should be doing yeah they should be
[190.80 - 193.60] doing a live rescue smoothie
[192.32 - 195.92] they should be doing the heavy metal
[193.60 - 198.00] detox smoothie but you know they're used
[195.92 - 199.44] to eating eggs every morning you know
[198.00 - 202.40] so it's like everybody's used to
[199.44 - 204.48] cracking open those eggs it's like okay
[202.40 - 206.72] you want them scrambled you want them
[204.48 - 209.92] fried you want the poached eggs
[206.72 - 212.80] wants a french toast right you want
[209.92 - 214.00] uh you want an omelette right so
[212.80 - 215.68] everybody wakes up in the morning it's
[214.00 - 216.72] like you know what old habit let's get
[215.68 - 220.56] the omelets going
[216.72 - 222.56] let's crack you know what maybe i should
[220.56 - 227.12] maybe i should crack an egg open and get
[222.56 - 228.56] it in the pan but that's a comfort food
[227.12 - 230.16] and it's comfort food that keeps us sick
[228.56 - 231.52] we don't realize that when we stay sick
[230.16 - 233.28] we stay sick with it so we're going to
[231.52 - 235.04] do instead the potato skillet without
[233.28 - 237.20] the insulin resistance

[372.40 - 376.32] potato skillet if you just came
[373.76 - 377.52] on we're talking about salicylates
[376.32 - 380.64] oxalates
[377.52 - 381.68] lectins talk about collagen a little bit
[380.64 - 384.40] too
[381.68 - 385.36] the scams in the system out there the
[384.40 - 388.40] scams
[385.36 - 389.84] yeah make make the investors you guys
[388.40 - 391.60] know how it works by the way you guys
[389.84 - 394.08] know how it works
[391.60 - 395.68] you got to have all this money right you
[394.08 - 397.12] gotta have all this money
[395.68 - 399.28] and then you get a bunch of investors
[397.12 - 401.04] that have all this money you buy into
[399.28 - 401.68] something like some kind of collagen
[401.04 - 405.20] product
[401.68 - 406.80] okay and then you put it out there
[405.20 - 409.20] and hopes that you know you market it
[406.80 - 410.80] and advertise it in hopes that everybody
[409.20 - 412.96] buys into it same thing with like the
[410.80 - 413.68] lectins you said all everybody buys into
[412.96 - 416.96] it and then you run
[413.68 - 419.68] ads 24 7 on your lectin supplement
[416.96 - 421.60] on your collagen supplement 24 so you
[419.68 - 423.12] run these ads everywhere and everybody
[421.60 - 424.88] and then it just becomes everything it's
[423.12 - 426.48] in every podcast everybody's using it's
[424.88 - 428.32] on every tv commercial right
[426.48 - 429.92] it's in every show it's everywhere it's
[428.32 - 432.96] like college and college and collagen

[432.96 - 437.92] lemon water hot
[434.32 - 440.80] okay you can do lemon water hot
[437.92 - 442.40] but it's not gonna flush it has to be
[440.80 - 445.44] alive
[442.40 - 447.52] it has to be alive when it comes down to
[445.44 - 449.60] lemon water doing what it needs to do
[447.52 - 452.32] the cleansing action that it needs to do
[449.60 - 455.68] it has to be alive
[452.32 - 457.92] it can't be dead it can't
[455.68 - 460.24] die that's what happens this lemon right
[457.92 - 462.96] now that came off of a tree
[460.24 - 464.48] is still alive it has living water
[462.96 - 466.96] inside of it

[475.68 - 481.76] it creates that flushing power

[528.86 - 532.16] [Music]
[530.24 - 533.36] anyway good to see you guys so glad
[532.16 - 536.80] you're coming on
[533.36 - 538.56] awesome just got some lemon water there
[536.80 - 540.16] you can do a whole lemon you can do a
[538.56 - 541.68] half a lemon just giving you some tips
[540.16 - 543.52] right now you guys
[541.68 - 545.20] whole lemon you can you can have half a
[543.52 - 547.36] lemon and
[545.20 - 549.20] that's okay and worst case scenario if
[547.36 - 550.64] you do a quarter lemon you can have a
[549.20 - 554.40] quarter lemon
[550.64 - 556.80] the morning cleanse has no fats in it
[554.40 - 558.72] do you know how we get the diabetes we
[556.80 - 559.28] get the type 2 diabetes because our
[558.72 - 562.32] liver
[559.28 - 563.68] gets blown out it gets weaker and weaker
[562.32 - 566.96] and weaker and weaker
[563.68 - 569.60] our liver gets blown out
[566.96 - 570.88] it gets weaker and weaker and weaker
[569.60 - 573.76] that's our liver right there
[570.88 - 575.44] okay there it is that's our gallbladder
[573.76 - 577.44] that's a liver
[575.44 - 580.16] and we weaken our liver it gets
[577.44 - 582.88] intoxicated it gets sludgy it gets
[580.16 - 584.88] burdened by fats all that eggs that you
[582.88 - 586.88] had all those years for breakfast
[584.88 - 588.24] burdens it and burns it and then all the
[586.88 - 590.48] fats you do every day because
[588.24 - 594.08] everybody's on milk cheese eggs butter
[590.48 - 596.56] bacon ham bologna
[594.08 - 597.92] talked to a friend the other day and my
[596.56 - 599.92] friend was like you know i've eaten so
[597.92 - 603.60] much baloney over my lifetime
[599.92 - 604.88] like i get it i mean people eat a lot of
[603.60 - 608.08] baloney
[604.88 - 610.16] they do right you know and so
[608.08 - 612.48] but what it does to the liver is just
[610.16 - 615.36] terrible it weakens it beats it down
[612.48 - 615.92] slows it down makes it sluggish over
[615.36 - 618.08] time
[615.92 - 620.16] stagnant sluggish once it starts
[618.08 - 620.72] happening the pancreas starts weakening
[620.16 - 622.64] too
[620.72 - 624.00] another thing too when you dump fats in
[622.64 - 625.36] you all day long because that's what
[624.00 - 626.88] everybody's doing they're dumping fats
[625.36 - 628.32] in them all day long the pancreas
[626.88 - 631.52] weakens
[628.32 - 632.80] the pancreas weakens it does i just saw
[631.52 - 636.48] on tic toc bologna
[632.80 - 637.92] right and when the pancreas weakens it's
[636.48 - 639.84] another reason why we're getting the
[637.92 - 641.52] boobs getting set up for type 2.
[639.84 - 643.36] so type 2 works in this way your liver
[641.52 - 645.28] starts getting beaten down
[643.36 - 648.40] your liver can't produce the bile it
[645.28 - 649.76] needs so your bile can't break down the
[648.40 - 651.28] fats as much
[649.76 - 653.20] more fats are in your bloodstream
[651.28 - 655.04] because your your liver is weakening
[653.20 - 656.80] because of the fats and more fats are in
[655.04 - 658.88] your bloodstream now and guess what
[656.80 - 661.60] guess what happens you guys your
[658.88 - 664.00] pancreas has to release more insulin
[661.60 - 665.12] because there's more fat in your
[664.00 - 667.36] bloodstream
[665.12 - 668.88] so your pancreas has to release more
[667.36 - 672.84] insulin more insulin
[668.88 - 675.60] eventually your credit card gets used
[672.84 - 676.72] up your pancreas and i've been saying
[675.60 - 678.16] this for years if you heard some of my
[676.72 - 679.60] early radio shows and even before that

[768.64 - 772.24] it i know it's hard either way we get
[770.24 - 775.04] into habits we get into patterns we get
[772.24 - 778.48] into comfort foods we get into emotional
[775.04 - 779.52] emotional patterns is where we get into
[778.48 - 781.44] two
[779.52 - 783.92] but it gives you a chance to kind of you
[781.44 - 785.60] know lower the grass-fed beef or
[783.92 - 787.92] lower the beef whatever kind of beef
[785.60 - 789.60] you're eating you know lower the eggs or
[787.92 - 792.00] hopefully get rid of the eggs lower the
[789.60 - 794.08] chicken right that's one thing there too
[792.00 - 795.84] and it helps and the same thing with
[794.08 - 797.36] butter right
[795.84 - 801.68] you're not gonna see me put butter in
[797.36 - 803.12] this pan i'm gonna cook right now
[801.68 - 804.88] you're not going to see me put butter in
[803.12 - 806.32] the pan just letting you know
[804.88 - 808.56] you're not i'm not going to put butter
[806.32 - 810.96] in the pan
[808.56 - 812.88] i don't want a heart attack i don't want
[810.96 - 815.12] a future heart attack
[812.88 - 816.88] okay anybody in the health scene that's
[815.12 - 819.36] promoting butter is just
[816.88 - 821.52] somebody who's oblivious to the
[819.36 - 824.00] heart-stopping power of butter
[821.52 - 824.56] you know i heard one time someone says
[824.00 - 827.44] nah
[824.56 - 829.20] butter has healing power i'm like that's
[827.44 - 831.28] a head scratcher to me because butter
[829.20 - 835.12] has got heart stopping power
[831.28 - 835.12] that's heart stopping power
[836.64 - 840.00] that butter builds up in your heart
[838.24 - 842.32] builds up in your arteries you guys
[840.00 - 846.40] that's what it does it builds up in your
[842.32 - 846.40] arteries it folds up in your heart
[846.48 - 853.28] the butter builds up in here look
[850.16 - 854.32] right in there inside your heart the
[853.28 - 857.12] butter builds up
[854.32 - 858.80] in the valves over time that's what the
[857.12 - 860.64] butter does
[858.80 - 863.36] it's got to keep you butter free
[860.64 - 866.48] courtney mma butterfree right
[863.36 - 869.12] radical fats we get in trouble maybe
[866.48 - 873.28] you're not doing butter maybe you're hip
[869.12 - 876.64] are you a hipster are you hip
[873.28 - 877.60] are you doing the coconut oil you found
[876.64 - 880.80] like the new way
[877.60 - 881.92] coconut oil still is gonna it's still
[880.80 - 886.00] gonna build up
[881.92 - 888.32] in the arteries and veins over time
[886.00 - 890.08] if too much fat's in your diet it's
[888.32 - 892.80] still going to build up in your heart
[890.08 - 895.36] and arteries and veins over time
[892.80 - 896.88] keep that in mind even the healthy fats
[895.36 - 901.36] you use them sparingly
[896.88 - 904.56] you use them carefully you respect them
[901.36 - 906.00] people have no respect for fats laura
[904.56 - 909.52] says why doesn't it melt
[906.00 - 914.00] in our bodies and flush out
[909.52 - 916.64] well laura really good question
[914.00 - 918.48] so fat has to be dispersed it has to
[916.64 - 919.44] break down inside her body so it has to
[918.48 - 921.76] be dispersed
[919.44 - 922.88] and it gets dispersed right here so this
[921.76 - 925.28] is how it goes
[922.88 - 925.92] okay put the i'm going gonna put the
[925.28 - 929.04] liver back
[925.92 - 930.64] inside this this guy right here for some
[929.04 - 932.48] reason this guy's stomach is acting
[930.64 - 934.72] weird over here
[932.48 - 934.72] so
[936.08 - 941.20] when you eat the fats your liver has to
[939.92 - 945.44] produce something
[941.20 - 948.88] that's really really astringent
[945.44 - 951.92] right and that's your bile that bile
[948.88 - 953.04] has to break down the butter that's its
[951.92 - 956.80] role that's its
[953.04 - 958.80] job it has to break it down okay
[956.80 - 960.32] so when you're having that butter on
[958.80 - 962.00] your grilled cheese sandwiches you just
[960.32 - 964.72] cooked your grilled cheese
[962.00 - 967.44] right and you got you you put butter in
[964.72 - 970.24] the pan right
[967.44 - 972.40] you did all that that butter has to
[970.24 - 974.32] break down that cheese has to break down
[972.40 - 977.44] too so how is it going to break down
[974.32 - 980.16] the heat of your body isn't enough
[977.44 - 982.48] so the heat of your body is not enough
[980.16 - 985.68] to break those fats down
[982.48 - 987.04] you need more than that you need a
[985.68 - 990.56] dissolver
[987.04 - 993.84] so your bile is a fat dissolver
[990.56 - 997.84] right you got another fat dissolver
[993.84 - 997.84] it's your adrenaline
[998.24 - 1002.64] adrenaline is a is a fat thinner it's a
[1001.44 - 1004.48] blood thinner so
[1002.64 - 1006.16] these are your adrenals right here the
[1004.48 - 1007.92] more fat you put in your body
[1006.16 - 1010.00] the more adrenaline you're going to have
[1007.92 - 1011.84] to use then your hormones start
[1010.00 - 1013.04] to go out of whack as the years go on
[1011.84 - 1016.32] because you've been burning out your
[1013.04 - 1018.32] adrenals by using it for fats
[1016.32 - 1020.16] so you're using your adrenals for fats
[1018.32 - 1022.08] all these years
[1020.16 - 1023.60] and then they start to break down and
[1022.08 - 1026.96] guess what your adrenals re
[1023.60 - 1028.96] your adrenals produce reproductive
[1026.96 - 1034.00] hormones
[1028.96 - 1038.64] they also produce feel good hormones
[1034.00 - 1042.00] adrenals are a hormone producer
[1038.64 - 1045.20] your liver is a hormone producer
[1042.00 - 1048.56] so our hormone systems break down
[1045.20 - 1050.40] because we fat them to death
[1048.56 - 1052.00] we fatter adrenals to death because they
[1050.40 - 1053.92] have to actually create something so
[1052.00 - 1055.12] corrosive that it dissolves fat in the
[1053.92 - 1058.00] bloodstream and then
[1055.12 - 1060.56] and then we have to push the liver
[1058.00 - 1062.56] beyond its limits to to create enough
[1060.56 - 1065.28] bile to break down and dissolve fat
[1062.56 - 1067.60] too so we're doing all this and we're
[1065.28 - 1068.56] wearing ourselves down we're wearing
[1067.60 - 1070.32] ourselves down
[1068.56 - 1071.84] there's just a couple of things right
[1070.32 - 1074.08] here i mean we can go into this
[1071.84 - 1077.20] all day on how fat works but i gotta
[1074.08 - 1080.56] make some food for you guys too
[1077.20 - 1084.32] lemons don't ruin teeth
[1080.56 - 1087.36] they don't ruin teeth
[1084.32 - 1090.48] if they did i don't think i'd have a
[1087.36 - 1091.60] tooth left i don't think i would have
[1090.48 - 1094.48] one left
[1091.60 - 1095.28] because you got to understand something
[1094.48 - 1098.32] i've eaten
[1095.28 - 1099.36] lemons for years and decades suck on
[1098.32 - 1101.52] them
[1099.36 - 1102.64] i actually do the lemon water every
[1101.52 - 1105.52] single day
[1102.64 - 1107.28] like lemon is in my life every day all
[1105.52 - 1109.36] day long one way or another
[1107.28 - 1111.36] and i don't have the whole veneers thing
[1109.36 - 1112.80] i don't have implants i don't my teeth
[1111.36 - 1114.08] aren't all drilled i don't have all
[1112.80 - 1116.32] these problems i don't have
[1114.08 - 1117.68] abscesses i don't have gum disease i
[1116.32 - 1121.44] don't have cavities i don't have
[1117.68 - 1124.08] i don't have um bridges i don't have
[1121.44 - 1125.12] dentures i don't need to get the veneers
[1124.08 - 1126.80] i don't need to get off
[1125.12 - 1128.24] so all implants don't like i said no
[1126.80 - 1131.20] root canals right
[1128.24 - 1133.04] and one reason right is making sure
[1131.20 - 1135.04] mineralized leafy greens you're doing
[1133.04 - 1136.16] all that stuff another reason is lemons
[1135.04 - 1138.56] keep your teeth
[1136.16 - 1139.68] they keep your teeth i don't do vinegar
[1138.56 - 1143.52] i don't do
[1139.68 - 1145.68] vinegars i don't do and i'm not 25 30
[1143.52 - 1147.12] years old i know 25 30 year old people
[1145.68 - 1150.40] that just you know
[1147.12 - 1151.60] 25 30 year old uh you know and they're
[1150.40 - 1152.56] and they're just their teeth are just
[1151.60 - 1155.60] all falling apart
[1152.56 - 1156.64] falling out right i'm not spraying
[1155.60 - 1159.44] chicken
[1156.64 - 1160.40] and the reason why i've kept my teeth in
[1159.44 - 1162.64] check
[1160.40 - 1165.52] is no vinegar keeping the vinegar
[1162.64 - 1169.04] vinegar's the teeth destroyer
[1165.52 - 1172.56] caffeine is the teeth destroyer right
[1169.04 - 1175.92] caffeine industry they're if if they
[1172.56 - 1178.32] actually did not exist you wouldn't
[1175.92 - 1178.88] believe the dental industry would be
[1178.32 - 1182.08] like
[1178.88 - 1184.00] they would be lost they would be lost
[1182.08 - 1186.64] you know the dental industry is like it
[1184.00 - 1188.88] is because of all the caffeine
[1186.64 - 1190.80] you know and the vinegar too i mean the
[1188.88 - 1192.40] vinegar is the ultimate teeth destroyer
[1190.80 - 1193.84] caffeine's the ultimate teeth breaker
[1192.40 - 1196.16] downer and destroyer
[1193.84 - 1198.48] as time goes on that's what it does you
[1196.16 - 1200.32] lose your calcium in your teeth and you
[1198.48 - 1200.96] bring your calcium back with the lemon
[1200.32 - 1202.32] water

[1245.28 - 1251.76] one the cold sore and the fever blister
[1248.72 - 1253.92] mary fox then why did lemon water have a
[1251.76 - 1255.44] wearing effect on my teeth when i drank
[1253.92 - 1258.64] it for several months
[1255.44 - 1260.08] i did use to drink cacao drinks and eat
[1258.64 - 1262.40] things with vinegar
[1260.08 - 1263.68] is sauerkraut good for you okay so
[1262.40 - 1266.80] here's how it works
[1263.68 - 1269.20] teeth are a time capsule okay
[1266.80 - 1270.24] if you do vinegar there's going to be
[1269.20 - 1272.40] this moment where
[1270.24 - 1274.96] everything finally gets pushed over the
[1272.40 - 1277.20] edge and your teeth just fall apart
[1274.96 - 1279.52] that's just how it works you can do this
[1277.20 - 1280.80] someone can be 25 years old do vinegar
[1279.52 - 1283.04] their teeth aren't going to fall apart
[1280.80 - 1285.92] in two months not it
[1283.04 - 1289.12] they're going to be 32 years old and
[1285.92 - 1291.36] it's just going to start falling apart
[1289.12 - 1293.84] and if they could have rolled up they
[1291.36 - 1297.04] could have rode in a hot air balloon
[1293.84 - 1298.16] the day the dentist said your teeth are
[1297.04 - 1299.68] falling apart
[1298.16 - 1301.76] and it would have been the hot air
[1299.68 - 1303.52] balloon they floated in with friends
[1301.76 - 1304.88] that caused the problem you see how it
[1303.52 - 1306.80] works
[1304.88 - 1308.64] they could have taken a boat ride on a
[1306.80 - 1310.56] lake
[1308.64 - 1312.16] and then it was around the time their
[1310.56 - 1313.92] teeth just crumbled and you can just say
[1312.16 - 1315.04] what was the boat ride i haven't been in
[1313.92 - 1317.28] a lake i haven't
[1315.04 - 1318.32] been i haven't been in a boat ride for a
[1317.28 - 1321.04] long time
[1318.32 - 1322.40] it's easy to blend you can start coconut
[1321.04 - 1324.32] oil for the first time in your life
[1322.40 - 1324.96] where i'm doing oil pulling now and your
[1324.32 - 1327.76] teeth just
[1324.96 - 1329.68] fall apart in one month it's not because
[1327.76 - 1332.96] coconut oil coconut pulling
[1329.68 - 1334.64] you know oil pulling did it
[1332.96 - 1336.32] even though it causes gum disease oil
[1334.64 - 1338.96] pulling does cause cause
[1336.32 - 1340.24] long term it does cause gum disease the
[1338.96 - 1341.92] point is is
[1340.24 - 1343.60] it's like but you're gonna think it was
[1341.92 - 1345.12] the oil pulling that did it in that
[1343.60 - 1346.96] month you just started the oil pulling
[1345.12 - 1348.88] meanwhile it's all the vinegar you did
[1346.96 - 1350.00] in caffeine you did in cacao and
[1348.88 - 1352.80] chocolate
[1350.00 - 1354.00] by the way the oil pulling it coats

[2028.80 - 2034.40] spot on you know the reason why i got to
[2032.16 - 2036.00] stop the juicer for a second okay
[2034.40 - 2038.32] because here here's what's interesting
[2036.00 - 2038.32] all right
[2039.04 - 2044.32] you know what you can't live free from
[2042.56 - 2046.48] live without you can't live without
[2044.32 - 2050.08] glucose you know why you die
[2046.48 - 2053.52] really quick you die really fast
[2050.08 - 2055.92] that's why and
[2053.52 - 2057.60] if you don't get glucose to the brain in
[2055.92 - 2058.72] under 10 seconds your brain tissue
[2057.60 - 2063.12] starts to die
[2058.72 - 2064.80] in under five seconds it starts to die
[2063.12 - 2066.80] when diabetics get low blood sugar they
[2064.80 - 2068.64] hit the floor
[2066.80 - 2070.64] i can't say how many stories i heard
[2068.64 - 2074.56] from doctors and other people
[2070.64 - 2076.24] all through the years including myself
[2074.56 - 2079.28] by saving somebody's life with a little
[2076.24 - 2082.32] orange juice i happen to have on hand
[2079.28 - 2089.28] okay a type 1 diabetic on the floor
[2082.32 - 2092.08] about to go into a diabetic coma
[2089.28 - 2094.16] i had to actually take my orange juice
[2092.08 - 2095.28] and get it into the mouth of the diet of
[2094.16 - 2098.00] the diabetic
[2095.28 - 2100.88] while they were still coherent and still
[2098.00 - 2100.88] able to swallow
[2101.36 - 2108.16] glucose we can't live without
[2105.52 - 2109.76] fat you can take all the fat away you
[2108.16 - 2112.16] can still live to be whatever age you're
[2109.76 - 2112.16] gonna be
[2112.32 - 2117.28] you take the fat out it's okay
[2115.36 - 2119.52] look if it's too much keep the fats in
[2117.28 - 2120.56] just do do other steps medical medium
[2119.52 - 2123.36] steps

[2179.44 - 2184.72] bloodstream
[2180.48 - 2184.72] the more oxygen your brain loses
[2185.12 - 2188.16] the more fat in your bloodstream every
[2186.88 - 2191.12] day the less oxygen
[2188.16 - 2191.12] inside your brain
[2192.24 - 2200.16] that's how it works notice they measure

[2261.44 - 2266.64] buys into it
[2262.57 - 2270.56] [Music]
[2266.64 - 2273.04] because people are suckers
[2270.56 - 2275.12] they should check the blood fat levels
[2273.04 - 2276.96] and see how dangerous they are
[2275.12 - 2278.88] and see why someone's probably gonna
[2276.96 - 2282.56] have a heart attack
[2278.88 - 2282.88] but they don't and all that fat builds
[2282.56 - 2285.92] up

[2321.36 - 2328.08] nurse check the patients
[2324.80 - 2331.60] check the patient's blood fat
[2328.08 - 2333.12] oh we can't how come oh it's
[2331.60 - 2335.36] medical research and science doesn't
[2333.12 - 2338.48] know about the blood fat

[2374.49 - 2382.24] [Music]
[2377.44 - 2385.04] seaweed here stop making sense
[2382.24 - 2385.04] mm critics
[2388.48 - 2391.96] they're supposed to be checking for
[2389.92 - 2393.76] blood fat you guys
[2391.96 - 2395.20] [Music]
[2393.76 - 2396.64] but they don't they check for blood
[2395.20 - 2397.28] sugar because yes blood sugar is
[2396.64 - 2398.72] critical
[2397.28 - 2400.16] they're also supposed to be checking
[2398.72 - 2401.28] blood fat that's really what they're
[2400.16 - 2402.72] supposed to be checking because when you
[2401.28 - 2404.80] check the blood fat then you can find
[2402.72 - 2406.88] out the insulin resistance for real
[2404.80 - 2411.76] then you can find out that there's a
[2406.88 - 2413.84] pandemic of insulin resistance
[2411.76 - 2415.60] it's the high fats not letting the sugar
[2413.84 - 2417.76] into your cells how many times
[2415.60 - 2418.88] times have i mentioned that so high fats
[2417.76 - 2422.08] not letting sugar
[2418.88 - 2426.40] into the cells that's how it works
[2422.08 - 2426.40] that's what creates high blood sugar
[2426.48 - 2432.08] talked about that all the time you guys
[2428.13 - 2434.72] [Music]
[2432.08 - 2439.84] so i got um it looks like a little stir
[2434.72 - 2439.84] fry going but i'm doing

[2460.48 - 2464.84] life to do an oil slick
[2462.64 - 2466.32] because we're taught to do oil and
[2464.84 - 2469.44] everything

[2507.20 - 2510.24] itself
[2508.40 - 2511.76] it's the only way medical medium
[2510.24 - 2513.68] information is taught it
[2511.76 - 2515.84] but leave it up to an influence or to
[2513.68 - 2518.40] squeeze lemon in it

[2518.40 - 2522.56] yoga class

[2522.56 - 2526.56] class you got to put lemon in it
[2524.24 - 2528.32] so that nobody at the yoga class gets
[2526.56 - 2529.84] one benefit from their celery juice

[2908.48 - 2911.60] cleanse and i'm going to reiterate this
[2910.32 - 2913.28] if you guys are okay with this
[2911.60 - 2914.96] i know i burn your ears out some of you
[2913.28 - 2917.52] but i'm just gonna let you know
[2914.96 - 2918.96] you can't cleanse the body ever unless
[2917.52 - 2921.28] you're fat free
[2918.96 - 2922.56] at least in the morning you won't be
[2921.28 - 2925.20] able to cleanse even partial
[2922.56 - 2927.36] toxins out it's not gonna happen it's
[2925.20 - 2928.96] not gonna happen
[2927.36 - 2932.00] going to keep your toxins you're going
[2928.96 - 2933.04] to own them you know that whole phrase
[2932.00 - 2935.68] you guys we're about to talk about
[2933.04 - 2938.72] fructose intolerance um
[2935.68 - 2941.20] salicylic salicylic acid uh
[2938.72 - 2944.16] you know intolerance histamine hives
[2941.20 - 2944.16] we'll talk about that
[2944.72 - 2951.76] salicylates talk about salicylates
[2948.96 - 2951.76] we'll talk about that
[2954.48 - 2956.96] because you can easily be tricked you
[2955.92 - 2958.16] don't know why you're sick you're
[2956.96 - 2959.52] walking around you don't know why you're
[2958.16 - 2960.80] sick you're going to doctor to doctor
[2959.52 - 2964.08] you don't know why you're sick
[2960.80 - 2966.64] nobody knows why you're sick and
[2964.08 - 2967.92] someone's often says salicylates
[2966.64 - 2970.72] salicylates
[2967.92 - 2971.36] what's that salicylate or maybe you're
[2970.72 - 2973.68] maybe
[2971.36 - 2974.72] you're the lucky one that stumbled
[2973.68 - 2977.52] across somebody saying
[2974.72 - 2977.92] oxalates oxalates is that my problem
[2977.52 - 2979.52] whoa
[2977.92 - 2981.20] i didn't know it it's oxalates all this
[2979.52 - 2983.60] time or you know
[2981.20 - 2984.96] that those paid for campaigns like
[2983.60 - 2986.56] collecting campaigns
[2984.96 - 2988.16] so you can sell electing supplements
[2986.56 - 2989.12] like wait a minute i'm sick because of
[2988.16 - 2992.56] lectins
[2989.12 - 2994.00] first of all countless people are
[2992.56 - 2995.36] healing on medical medium information
[2994.00 - 2995.84] and they don't even think about the word
[2995.36 - 2997.04] lectin
[2995.84 - 2999.44] because lectins have nothing to do with
[2997.04 - 3001.28] healing or not but once you get down
[2999.44 - 3002.64] that road you're stuck you're stuck in
[3001.28 - 3005.20] that road man
[3002.64 - 3007.04] that road of misinformation the reason
[3005.20 - 3008.80] why we get the bloating the hives the
[3007.04 - 3009.92] histamines raise up and the fructose
[3008.80 - 3014.08] intolerance
[3009.92 - 3015.60] and um we get these we get these issues
[3014.08 - 3017.28] because the liver gets stagnant and
[3015.60 - 3020.32] sluggish it gets
[3017.28 - 3023.44] funky it gets gross it gets
[3020.32 - 3026.16] yucky inside that liver the liver gets
[3023.44 - 3029.60] yucky and bad inside of there that's
[3026.16 - 3029.60] what happens yucky and bad
[3029.68 - 3034.48] no one's getting fructose intolerant you
[3032.24 - 3037.60] can't be fructose intolerant that's just
[3034.48 - 3039.76] a fancy name for insulin resistance
[3037.60 - 3041.12] right you guys that's just a fancy name
[3039.76 - 3043.44] for insulin resistance
[3041.12 - 3046.56] you can't become fructose intolerant
[3043.44 - 3050.16] it's not possible on any level
[3046.56 - 3055.60] you can't be fructose intolerant
[3050.16 - 3060.32] but not cane sugar intolerant see
[3055.60 - 3060.32] you can't be you can't be
[3060.60 - 3064.56] carbohydrate intolerant
[3064.64 - 3068.08] with it just being a fructose you can't
[3067.60 - 3071.76] just be
[3068.08 - 3074.48] fructose intolerant it means you're
[3071.76 - 3075.44] all carbohydrate sugars and all
[3074.48 - 3078.00] intolerant
[3075.44 - 3080.96] but no one's intolerant of the basic
[3078.00 - 3084.88] needs your brain needs or you die
[3080.96 - 3086.64] okay so the the foundation of your
[3084.88 - 3090.00] existence is blood
[3086.64 - 3092.16] sugar you die without it you die without
[3090.00 - 3094.08] blood without your blood having sugar in
[3092.16 - 3096.56] it so you mean to tell me people are
[3094.08 - 3098.48] fructose intolerant
[3096.56 - 3100.56] first of all that's telling them they're
[3098.48 - 3103.60] sugar intolerant
[3100.56 - 3105.20] if you're sugar intolerant it's
[3103.60 - 3108.00] impossible
[3105.20 - 3108.72] your body is born and bred for thousands
[3108.00 - 3111.44] of years
[3108.72 - 3112.48] millions of years humans humans existed
[3111.44 - 3113.92] you existed in this
[3112.48 - 3115.68] if you want to believe they existed in
[3113.92 - 3118.80] this universe
[3115.68 - 3120.96] for millions of years okay
[3118.80 - 3122.48] say you just believe humans existed for
[3120.96 - 3124.08] ten thousand years
[3122.48 - 3125.76] on earth say you're somebody that just
[3124.08 - 3128.24] believes it's ten thousand years humans
[3125.76 - 3130.08] only existed on earth
[3128.24 - 3133.44] say you're somebody that believes humans
[3130.08 - 3136.84] existed for a million years
[3133.44 - 3138.48] for 10 million years whatever you
[3136.84 - 3142.24] believe
[3138.48 - 3147.84] the human body needs glucose
[3142.24 - 3147.84] in order to run to function to thrive
[3148.48 - 3156.24] no one's fructose intolerant
[3152.00 - 3158.80] that's a scam that test isn't even real
[3156.24 - 3160.88] it means you're all sugar intolerant no
[3158.80 - 3163.52] one's sugar intolerant because you need
[3160.88 - 3163.52] glucose
[3163.76 - 3166.80] but what they're not saying is you got
[3165.28 - 3170.48] insulin resistance
[3166.80 - 3171.44] it's a it's like a back-handed backwoods
[3170.48 - 3175.04] way
[3171.44 - 3175.04] of saying you're insulin resistant
[3177.68 - 3185.28] salicylate intolerance
[3181.52 - 3186.00] is really also something that's kind of
[3185.28 - 3190.40] made up
[3186.00 - 3192.88] no one's salicylate intolerant no one's
[3190.40 - 3194.00] no one's glucose intolerant no one's
[3192.88 - 3197.68] salicylate
[3194.00 - 3198.96] intolerant there's foods where
[3197.68 - 3201.52] salicylates are in
[3198.96 - 3202.80] foods those foods are healing foods it's
[3201.52 - 3205.04] how you get better
[3202.80 - 3205.92] so your symptoms go away it's like

[4036.48 - 4040.56] be cautious about the fruit fear being
[4039.28 - 4042.96] created by
[4040.56 - 4044.16] the practitioners out there that have
[4042.96 - 4046.88] misinformation
[4044.16 - 4048.48] because it started out as a as a total
[4046.88 - 4050.80] attack on fruit
[4048.48 - 4053.68] originally by the upper echelon of the
[4050.80 - 4053.68] medical industry
[4054.40 - 4057.68] and then they put plants out there to
[4056.48 - 4061.44] spread it
[4057.68 - 4062.72] long ago you want the banana ripe but
[4061.44 - 4064.16] you don't want it over ripe because you
[4062.72 - 4065.76] don't want it fermented but you don't
[4064.16 - 4067.28] want it under ripe you want you don't
[4065.76 - 4069.52] want the banana under ripe
[4067.28 - 4070.40] you don't want the banana over ripe keep
[4069.52 - 4073.52] that in mind
[4070.40 - 4075.28] really good tips right there you don't
[4073.52 - 4077.28] want the banana overripe you don't want
[4075.28 - 4079.52] the banana under ripe

[4081.04 - 4084.24] fermented food
[4082.64 - 4086.64] don't like it at all for a lot of
[4084.24 - 4086.64] reasons
[4089.44 - 4096.00] overripe gets you in trouble when it's
[4093.28 - 4096.32] over over ripe you don't want the banana
[4096.00 - 4098.40] so
[4096.32 - 4100.72] over ripe you don't want the skin so
[4098.40 - 4102.80] brown and the bananas mushy
[4100.72 - 4104.08] you don't want to do that because then
[4102.80 - 4106.56] it's just it's just it's starting to
[4104.08 - 4106.56] ferment
[4110.48 - 4115.04] you don't want to do that i get hungry

[4144.88 - 4149.04] salt and you want a little in there
[4147.12 - 4150.72] as long as you're fat free that's a

[4164.72 - 4167.60] water right
[4165.68 - 4169.60] and you can then save this for lunch and
[4167.60 - 4171.52] then have a fat free lunch and go a
[4169.60 - 4172.88] little bit longer fat free how amazing
[4171.52 - 4175.84] is that
[4172.88 - 4177.68] there's thousands of combinations
[4175.84 - 4178.88] thousands of combinations to heal and
[4177.68 - 4181.28] medical medium books
[4178.88 - 4183.52] and information just so you know it's
[4181.28 - 4184.56] all here there's no one medical medium

[4505.52 - 4509.44] healing
[4506.80 - 4510.96] vinegar will stop some body from healing
[4509.44 - 4513.68] i'm telling you right now that's the
[4510.96 - 4513.68] dish right there
[4516.96 - 4520.24] the vinegar goes down goes in the body
[4519.76 - 4522.48] boom
[4520.24 - 4524.88] you stopped from healing you're not
[4522.48 - 4526.64] healing anymore you're not healing
[4524.88 - 4529.04] your blood turns to acid you have
[4526.64 - 4530.88] kombucha tea goes inside the body
[4529.04 - 4532.24] boom you're not healing anymore your
[4530.88 - 4534.48] blood turns acid

[4534.48 - 4537.60] acid
[4535.44 - 4539.04] your healing slows down your healing
[4537.60 - 4540.56] stops

[4540.56 - 4544.64] there okay
[4542.48 - 4546.16] and i'm keeping people from getting a
[4544.64 - 4547.76] lot of lot worse and
[4546.16 - 4549.28] and when you're when you're a detective
[4547.76 - 4550.56] for people you help them from getting a
[4549.28 - 4552.48] lot worse you're actually helping them
[4550.56 - 4554.24] you're saving their butt you're at least
[4552.48 - 4557.44] helping to slow it down
[4554.24 - 4558.00] for them you know when you when people
[4557.44 - 4559.28] are doing
[4558.00 - 4560.48] you're doing stuff they're doing
[4559.28 - 4561.52] nutritional yeast they're doing the
[4560.48 - 4563.52] vinegar
[4561.52 - 4566.64] doing the kombucha tea they're doing
[4563.52 - 4568.80] their chocolate boom you stop peeling
[4566.64 - 4569.68] you can't heal tank and chocolate you
[4568.80 - 4572.00] can't
[4569.68 - 4574.88] you can't heal all the way tanking that
[4572.00 - 4577.52] chocolate it's not gonna happen
[4574.88 - 4579.28] it's not gonna happen you have to keep
[4577.52 - 4580.00] these things out if you wanna go all the
[4579.28 - 4582.72] way i'm not
[4580.00 - 4583.36] shaming anybody i'm not judging anybody
[4582.72 - 4587.28] that's not
[4583.36 - 4588.88] at all what it is is if you want to go
[4587.28 - 4590.32] the mile you actually want to heal all
[4588.88 - 4591.92] the way if you're really tired of being
[4590.32 - 4593.68] sick we got to go a little bit further
[4591.92 - 4597.20] because moderation doesn't fix
[4593.68 - 4600.00] us it doesn't fix us at all
[4597.20 - 4600.72] it doesn't fix us moderation gets us in
[4600.00 - 4603.44] trouble
[4600.72 - 4603.84] then we can't heal and then we're stuck
[4603.44 - 4605.92] right
[4603.84 - 4607.52] the problem is if you're not so sick you
[4605.92 - 4609.44] can dabble with all the out
[4607.52 - 4610.40] there you can dabble with all the trends
[4609.44 - 4612.24] you can dabble
[4610.40 - 4614.16] you can dabble if you're not so sick you
[4612.24 - 4615.68] can dabble with it all if you're not so
[4614.16 - 4617.68] sick you can dabble with it all
[4615.68 - 4619.36] you can just play around oh i got all my
[4617.68 - 4621.44] stuff here i'm not so sick

[4623.68 - 4627.36] i could have coconut oil every single
[4625.28 - 4629.52] day i could eat almonds all day long
[4627.36 - 4630.56] i can have fish i could have chicken i
[4629.52 - 4632.88] could have lots of
[4630.56 - 4633.76] lots of stuff because i'm not i'm not

[4647.04 - 4651.76] know
[4648.16 - 4653.76] not so sick that's how it works

[4653.76 - 4656.40] could screw around with that
[4654.96 - 4657.76] because i'm not so sick i could play
[4656.40 - 4658.48] around with a keto diet because i'm not
[4657.76 - 4660.08] so sick
[4658.48 - 4661.68] i could play around with another no
[4660.08 - 4664.08] processed food diet
[4661.68 - 4666.00] because you're not so sick you can mess
[4664.08 - 4666.48] around mess around mess around until one
[4666.00 - 4669.20] day
[4666.48 - 4670.64] you fall off the cliff and now your head
[4669.20 - 4672.40] is so screwed up from all the
[4670.64 - 4674.64] misinformation out there you ain't got a
[4672.40 - 4677.68] chance in hell to get better
[4674.64 - 4678.00] until you buckle down until you buckle
[4677.68 - 4680.00] down
[4678.00 - 4681.36] you don't have a chance in hell to get
[4680.00 - 4683.52] better when you go
[4681.36 - 4685.84] too far and get too sick because the
[4683.52 - 4687.76] trends get in the way
[4685.84 - 4689.36] and then the pathogens and toxins if you
[4687.76 - 4690.16] don't know about the pathogens and
[4689.36 - 4692.72] toxins
[4690.16 - 4694.08] if you don't know about those if you
[4692.72 - 4695.36] don't know how to get them out of the
[4694.08 - 4696.88] body if you don't know how to get the
[4695.36 - 4698.48] metals out of the body if you don't know
[4696.88 - 4700.72] what to do what to avoid
[4698.48 - 4702.56] what kind of foods to avoid if you don't
[4700.72 - 4705.12] know about the troublemakers
[4702.56 - 4706.96] if you don't know about all this it's
[4705.12 - 4708.56] gonna be hard to get better
[4706.96 - 4710.48] when you're not so sick you could play
[4708.56 - 4712.24] around in it i'll go do this i'll go
