1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,800
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,759
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,480
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,480
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,920
secrets about health much of which is

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,880
ahead of what's out there now as I've

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,199
always said who is 10 or 20 or 30 years

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,439
to wait for answers to their illnesses

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,359
to their

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,160
symptoms and life is precious I mean you

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,800
know that uh I know that you know that

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,560
we know that there's no time to spare so

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,760
let's let get into the healing now

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,600
Today's Show is part two of the

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,960
addiction series we can call it a series

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,280
I guess but it's part two okay so and

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
that means if you're you know into the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,800
show I mean you you need to you need to

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
get the other show or or or listen to

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,399
the other show is what I'm saying got to

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,320
go back if you missed it last week but

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,600
this is part two of addiction the reason

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,920
why it's part two is because even though

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,760
we did practically a full hour on

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,960
information about addictions and and

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,840
being addicted and in the whole bit even

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,320
though we did that um there's so much to

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,080
cover there really is to do it justice

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:15,360
look any show I've ever done probably

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,759
needs four shows four shows for that

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
topic and I do one show and they say hey

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,840
look we're going to do another one

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,720
another day down the road and it's true

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,560
because I I have done started to do a

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,200
couple of shows and and getting into

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,159
them more uh topics that we've done in

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,079
the older shows and getting into getting

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,759
into it more with more information about

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,040
it all so that's true but addiction is

41
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:40,680
the kind of thing where it just felt

42
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,840
look I I feel the addiction of wanting

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,119
to get part two done of getting the

44
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,360
information out now and not

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,159
waiting uh um four months or six months

46
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,159
or eight months or a year something like

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
that whatever it is you know hey it's

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,240
like an addiction to do this show no I'm

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000
just kidding there but you know what I

50
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,560
mean I have to get this done so we have

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,240
that information in our hands because

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,759
when it comes down to addiction it's no

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,840
joke I mean look the smallest addictions

54
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,879
and I said this before in the in in the

55
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,920
last show the smallest ones can be

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,560
really hard and there's a lot of

57
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,800
different small ones but there's some

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,560
really heavy duty big ones and there's

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,440
nothing wrong with you know catching the

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,000
small ones seeing seeing them sometimes

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,920
for what they are because it can stop us

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,440
from getting into a big one you know

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,200
some of the things that I offer um in

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,760
the last show and this show help us

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,239
battle you know and get help us battle

66
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,319
that addiction or it's going to help us

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,959
break away from not getting in trouble

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,400
deeper into an addiction that's a whole

69
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,440
another thing because here's here's the

70
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,080
here's how it works with addictions it

71
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,080
takes everything you got anything you

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,440
can get everywhere you can get it

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,800
percentage wise 5% support here 5%

74
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,360
support here 5% support here because it

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,519
matters it could stop you from going

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,319
back to a drug

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,879
rehab and it it can it can because if

78
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,640
you don't have that support the problem

79
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,560
is when we're deep into addictions or we

80
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,280
have small addictions whatever it could

81
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,720
be there's this breaking point and we

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,400
just break we're just like okay that's

83
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,120
it you know that's that's the point I've

84
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,200
seen it for years for with people and

85
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,640
they break and they fall victim you know

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,159
they fall into it and if there was just

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,400
5% more of support in this area or this

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,480
area or something they're eating that

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
could

90
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,519
actually you know throw off that

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
addiction just enough where they have

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,120
enough Inner Strength or spiritually

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,080
speaking just enough spiritually just

94
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,640
there for them a little bit of spiritual

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,480
wisdom something that gives the other 8%

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,319
other 2% other 9% and stops The Fallout

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,319
and stops The Fallout so from the nasty

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,519
happening where oh my God now back into

99
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,959
this whole addictive behavior again and

100
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,680
I can't seem to swim out of it every

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,840
little bit counts in part one I covered

102
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,560
a lot of stuff on on these two big

103
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,040
groups one is

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,959
adrenaline okay and the other one

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,560
glucose the reason why when you're aware

106
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,040
of glucose deficiencies and I talked

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,280
about that part one when you're aware of

108
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,560
glucose deficiencies you can literally

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,199
stop yourself from falling into whatever

110
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,000
addiction you might be heading into

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,160
whatever might be and if you're aware of

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,080
how adrenaline plays the role or plays a

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,039
role into addiction you can be aware of

114
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,919
it and be like whoa wait a minute I'm

115
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,520
getting an adrenaline high right now and

116
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,199
that adrenaline high is leading me to oh

117
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,479
G to grab some drug or grab that alcohol

118
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:55,840
or grab that candy whatever it may be so

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,600

have a we have some of those too and

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
there's nothing wrong with that because

148
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,919
if you only have two seconds and you're

149
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
flipping through social media and you're

150
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,560

155
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,800
getting better what's going on with the

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,479
you know the medical medium books how

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,319
people are into the medical medium books

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,000
and how they're changing people's lives

159
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,560
you might be one of them you might know

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,400
just by you know hearing this and being

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
like hey I'm one of them and if you're

162
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,639
not there yet you'll get there one step

163
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
at a time well actually it's three steps

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,680
up to two steps back okay three steps up

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,160
two steps back that means that's the

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,599
healing process because when you're

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
healing your body's doing all kinds of

168
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,160
miraculous things all kinds of

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,759

energies are happening within the body

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
and your immune systems recalibrating

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,639
constantly as you defeat defeat the

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,759
Epstein bar viruses you beat down some

175
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,479
kind of bacteria as you beat down some

176
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,319
other toxin or some other viral

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,800
component and that's how the body

mysteriously Works always remember

that's a three steps up two steps back

180
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,199
um a little bit about me I was given a

present wasn't given that kind it was

184
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,199
wrapped with a bow and it was had paper

185
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,240
and it was for my birthday no it was

186
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,319
given a gift um from God um of of

187
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,160
hearing a voice perfectly clear someone

188
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:33,919
said to me well are you hearing God no

189
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm not um I wish I was you've read my

190
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,319
first book I wanted to talk to God so

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,960
bad and hear God but instead I was

192
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,120
hearing what um what has been introduced

193
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,479
to me since a child as Spirit of the

194
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,440
most high and spirit I call Spirit was

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,800
speaking to me at age four told me my

196
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,520
grandmother had lung cancer when nobody

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,400
knew and and ever since then it's it was

198
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,280
every single day after that I had the

199
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,360
sight to see and hear what was happening

200
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,199
with People's Health but in in book one

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
in the first chapter origins of the

202
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,560
medical medium I talk about you know my

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,000
struggle with hearing the voice and

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,840
wanting to cut out that voice get

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,560
getting rid of that voice because I hear

206
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,720
it from the outside of the body not the

207
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,840
in in inside so I have no control the

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,080
voice is just always there as if

209
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,360
someone's talking to you uh perfectly

210
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,720
clear and hearing that voice you know

211
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,319
was always telling me what people's

212
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,919
struggles and their conditions and

213
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,760
what's happening with what's going on in

214
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,839
their Li lives and it was tiring it was

215
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,880
tiring as a child and I could honestly

216
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,279
say sometimes it still beats me down to

217
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,440
today so I I stay out of crowds as much

218
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,279
as I can but what I will tell you though

219
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,920
is I wanted to talk directly to God I

220
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,760
you know I I wanted to cut out the

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
middleman which was spirit and I wanted

222
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,560
God to speak to me and hear God

223
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,760
perfectly clear and you know and even

224
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,079
though I was told by spirit that the

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,399
gift obviously came from God I couldn't

226
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:06,800
hear God and that was really difficult

227
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,920
really difficult I'm telling telling you

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,399
a little bit about my gift um because a

229
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,880
well first of all I don't really talk

230
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,680
about it that much or go into detail too

231
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,480
many times but I'm talking because look

232
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,720
you know when we're in addictions and

233
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,440
we're deep into addictions and we feel

234
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,680
hopeless and we feel lost oh I realize

235
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,000
having a voice talk to you could be a

236
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,760
great way to pull you out of it and

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,480
that's true and that's true and I and

238
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,160
and but with when it comes down to

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,079
addictions having information can

240
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,079
replace sometimes not having that voice

241
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,839
so I might have been given a gift that

242
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,320
tells me hey don't eat that Anthony

243
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,839
don't do this it doesn't mean I I won't

244
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,920
though I've been known to to especially

245
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,360
as a child known to go against spirit

246
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,839
and do what I wanted to do you know make

247
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,279
my way espe ly through a teenager and um

248
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,920
but but regardless you know I still have

249
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,279
that voice that says don't do that

250
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,720
that's stupid

251
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,600
don't don't do that that's not g to help

252
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:19,040
you and but what happens is that uh when

253
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,360
we when we go through life we don't have

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,839
that voice it's hard to get it so we

255
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,200
seek it through counselors and you know

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,600
helpers in different ways and and you

257
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,560
know spiritual support in different ways

258
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
and we we seek it in these different

259
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,519
ways and you know it can be re really

260
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,320
helpful and you know and and so much but

261
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,480
but more than that because a lot of

262
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,240
people they they tend to you know they

263
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,240
tend to shy away from um help with their

264
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,680
addictions we know that they tend to

265
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
turn away from it I you might know you

266
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,800
might have done that you might have

267
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,040
known someone who who's done that and

268
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,160
you know when it happens sometimes

269
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:04,040
information you hear from other sources

270
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,600
and in other books or any sources can

271
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,880
can stick and resonate and hold and hold

272
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:16,440
true and that information kind of

273
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:19,800
replaces that inability to hear a voice

274
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,480
perfectly clear in the ear like I do and

275
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,839
so that's why this is important this is

276
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,560
really important to know information to

277
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,480
be armed with it to have a shield of

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,399
with it a shield of it

279
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,680
to to protect you to help protect you no

280
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,839
matter what no matter what illness as

281
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,079
well illness disease symptom whatever's

282
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,680
happening whatever diagnosis you've had

283
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,720
regardless it's good to have information

284
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,720
it can sometimes and many times be that

285
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,839
freeing moment be that

286
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,160
voice and it matters you know and look

287
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,920
I've been getting I've been the

288
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,519
messenger of information from Spirit and

289
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,360
providing that for everybody so so we

290
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,399
can all get a a a piece of spirit the

291
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,440
the spirit that I hear you know we all

292
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,959
have spirit in us we all have you know

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,440
we all have that that will to survive we

294
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,920
all have connection spiritually in

295
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,360
different ways and we all have our

296
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:23,360
connection to God but in the way I hear

297
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:25,880
it I like to offer that in any way I can

298
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,240
um the healing path is one way the radio

299
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,560
shows are another and the books of

300
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,360
course and anything I can do

301
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,399
um for everybody so so that's what it's

302
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,440
about so that's why we're here so I want

303
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,120
to go now into we're going to go now

304
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,279
into the whole heaviness of this the

305
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,320
lightness of it you name it that's where

306
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:48,440
we're starting now um so that's the plan

307
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,279
okay so I talked about adrenaline a lot

308
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,440
in the last show in part one and but

309
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:58,000
what I didn't Express or tell you is

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:03,440
that adrenaline itself is highly

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,279
addictive it is a drug it is such a drug

312
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,760
and so when we do things that are

313
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,680
adrenaline induced we get just as

314
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,040
addicted and sometimes more addicted to

315
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:22,240
the adren adrenaline

316
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,800
surges more so than the substance more

317
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,920
so than the candy more so than the

318
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,199
alcohol more so than the cigarettes more

319
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,279
so than the coffee coffee

320
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:35,639
yeah that's right coffee all right more

321
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,440
so than you know the

322
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,040
chocolate and I'm going to talk about

323
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
chocolate in a positive way a little bit

324
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,120
too not in just a negative way by saying

325
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,880
look you know it could be a an addiction

326
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,000
I just know so many people with nervous

327
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,519
system issues neurological symptoms and

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,480
neurological problems that if they eat

329
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,959
chocolate they get they literally

330
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,320
they're shaking they're shaking cuz

331
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,920
chocolate is is so neuro based I mean

332
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,519
it's B basically it's basically got some

333
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,000
neurotoxins in it as many health

334
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,199
benefits as it has in it it's got

335
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,480
neurotoxins in it I always say look if

336
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,079
you're really healthy and you feel great

337
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
and you don't have any confusion and you

338
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,880
don't have any brain fog and you don't

339
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,120
have any neurological shakes and you

340
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,279
don't have any Tremors and you don't

341
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,240
have any neurological pains and aches

342
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,759
and pains and stuff you could yeah I eat

343
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,079
chocolate it's got some health benefits

344
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:29,199
I'm sure packed in there but if you're

345
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,759
anywhere neurologically speaking at all

346
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,759
I would probably stay away from it now

347
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,800
the one thing I like about chocolate is

348
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,279
um for real addicts that are on opiates

349
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,959
and they're they're stuck you know

350
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,519
they're they're stuck on oxies or

351
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,160
they're see with a prescription or

352
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,680
whether that's street drugs or whatever

353
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,560
it is and they're really in deep and

354
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,759
whatever kind of drugs they're doing um

355
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,680
you know prescription nonprescription

356
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:59,560
whatever is going on um what happens is

357
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,040
chocolate can be really helpful it could

358
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:05,199
be one of that 5% 5% tool that I'm

359
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,079
talking about CU you need all these

360
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:13,320
different percentages that 5% tool to

361
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:17,440
actually stop you from caving on an

362
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,079
opioid caving on you know a drug caving

363
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,160
on a you know street drug pharmaceutical

364
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,959
whatever and of course you need the

365
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
rehab when you're in when you're in on

366
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,320
the drugs really heavy you need the

367
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
rehabs we know that you need to seek out

368
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,000
rehab you need to seek out support you

369
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
need family members supporting you we

370
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,680
know the whole thing you guys know about

371
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,920
it probably through experiences or just

372
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,480
anything you've read or learned or seen

373
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,480
even on television but and and you know

374
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,040
I've seen I've seen people I've worked

375
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,920
with people in some dire situations and

376
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,759
a secret one of the secret weapons if

377
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,120
someone's actually dry you know they're

378
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:53,519
actually dry they're off the wagget I

379
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,880
mean they're on the wagon however you

380
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
want to say and they're

381
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,680
clean chocolate can be helpful

382
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:06,440
periodically it can be a way to curve or

383
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,480
or stop someone from going onto back

384
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,959
onto a a heavy drug or heavy addiction

385
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,560
so that's the one positive thing I

386
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,720
really like about chocolate I remember

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:21,399
back 25 years ago in my office 25 years

388
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,839
ago in my office okay I had a stack of

389
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,680
chocolate bars the dark stuff you know

390
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,160
just it had sugar in it had the cane

391
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,399
sugar was like 69% or something or 70%

392
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,160
right caca the whole bid and it was

393
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,040
wasn't a raw chocolate it was a cooked

394
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,839
chocolate it was a bar all right and I

395
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,000
had these bars because Spirit taught me

396
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,880
that these chocolate bars can save

397
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
someone's life if it's the right person

398
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,560
at the right time that's what I was told

399
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,319
by spirit all right so those chocolate

400
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,759
bars were off limits to all the sick

401
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,079
people that came into my office to see

402
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,519
me every day 25 years ago okay that were

403
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,199
lined up and I mean they were lined up I

404
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,360
was working seven days a week s days a

405
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:07,400
week and I was working for free by the

406
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,959
way free I never charged I never charged

407
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,120
until a dear close friend said you're

408
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,880
going to starve to death okay I had no

409
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,640
car insurance I lost my car because I

410
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,720
wouldn't charge I had to live in the

411
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,640
office and I refused to charge but I was

412
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,799
dissolving because I couldn't even get

413
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,520
food or pay a bill and I

414
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,360
remember so you know 25 years ago I had

415
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,760
people lined up and they were coming in

416
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,600
droves and if if anybody had a symptom

417
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,840
that was neurological in any way whether

418
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,600
it's depression or anxiety or aches and

419
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,840
pains the whole bit those big stack of

420
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,720
chocolate bars they were off limit off

421
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
limits that's right because that was

422
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,000
just going to neurotoxic break them down

423
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
make them sicker eventually even if they

424
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,480
got a high off of it and they felt a

425
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,159
little better but let me tell you

426
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,919
something okay I remember a

427
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,000
19-year-old uh boy came in with his

428
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,720
mother and father all right and he was

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,480
addicted to street drugs he was addicted

430
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,799
to you know some kind of oxy or

431
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
something like that I don't know what it

432
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,280
was back then I think but it was

433
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,919
definitely an opioid it was it could

434
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,120
have been you know could have been one

435
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,320
of it was one of those and he was

436
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,880
addicted severely they went in and out

437
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,440
of rehab in and out of rehab constantly

438
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,640
the whole bit and he wasn't he wasn't

439
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,200
surviving this they came in out of

440
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,799
despera trity all right and spirit said

441
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,679
immediately the chocolate bars the

442
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,480
chocolate bars I said

443
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,000
ah these were big they weren't like the

444
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
kind you get in the you know the health

445
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,200
food store they you know the ones that

446
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,559
are only like 6 inches or 8 inches long

447
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,600
this was the big one it was like a foot

448
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,559
long kind of like the foot long hot

449
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,080
dogs you know it was like six or eight

450
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,080
inches you know wide or whatever it was

451
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,679
one of these and it was high quality

452
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,000
stuff and and you know had them stacked

453
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,360
I pulled the chocolate bar off the off

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
the thing and I said this is going to be

455
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,159
your weapon that's what I said I said

456
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,440
spirit says this is going to be your

457
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,600
weapon and the parents looked at me and

458
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,400
they said we're open to it because we're

459
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,240
desperate we've we've been through hell

460
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,559
and back we're losing our lives because

461
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,799
of this and because our son is losing

462
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:29,600
his life and he said yeah I said I said

463
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,559
you're you're you're you're weaning down

464
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,679
off your drugs you know you're working

465
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:35,919
with your your doctors on that you're

466
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,919
working on that whole thing I said but I

467
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,159
want you I want when you feel like

468
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,039
you're going insane and you're and

469
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,840
you're really struggling through that

470
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,480
weaning process at different times I

471
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,159
want you to start eating a hunk of this

472
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,280
chocolate and I don't mean like a little

473
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,880
bite I mean a hunk of this

474
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,000
chocolate you know I remember he he

475
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,840
looked at me I said look have a little

476
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,480
piece now I opened it up broke off a

477
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,919
piece and he and he was eating and he

478
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,799
said this is really good this is really

479
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,799
good and he smiled and his and and his

480
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,960
parents said it was the first time he

481
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,039
smiled in years couldn't even get a

482
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,600
smile out of him the first time he

483
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:16,240
smiled his name was Cole so Cole started

484
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,360
eating a piece and he smiled and he

485
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,960
looked at me and he said you know what

486
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,039
this this this can work I said you feel

487
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
it can work he said this can work and

488
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,400
the parents said I've never heard him

489
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,159
even say anything like that ever

490
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,320
throughout this whole Str process and he

491
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:37,720
said this could work and guess what it

492
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:41,080
did he was clean in fact he literally

493
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:44,480
weaned off rapidly off of the off the uh

494
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,440
the opioids with with the doctor rapidly

495
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,360
okay not only that but he was knowing

496
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,320
how to self-medicate with the chocolate

497
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,960
he was free from it his drug addiction

498
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,640
in 3 weeks three weeks never touched it

499
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,000
again again how do I know I stayed in

500
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,640
contact with them for years years after

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,679
that one reason why is because they

502
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,480
helped me out too is the parents said

503
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,960
why are you in this office here with you

504
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:18,279
know not able to eat not able to do

505
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,440
anything you helped us for free and they

506
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,080
were like we're just going to give you

507
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,520
some little donations here at the start

508
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,520
just so you can get some car insurance

509
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,880
just so you could drive I said well

510
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,880
driving doesn't really work for me that

511
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,919
great anyway because I hear Spirit as

512
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,559
I'm going down the street and spirit's

513
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,919
telling me as I'm at a stoplight what's

514
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,960
wrong with everybody in the left side of

515
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,200
me and the right side of me or in front

516
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,240
of me so you know but either way you

517
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,559
know so it was one of these things where

518
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,720
they said well you're going to have to

519
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:44,279
you're going to have to get something

520
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,400
something donations or something for

521
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,440
what you're doing and so you know it

522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,880
kind of moved forward in my life from

523
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,120
there that's just just filling in that

524
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:57,520
blank if you're curious but the point is

525
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,200
is Cole survived he survived Spirit told

526
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:05,720
me when he walked in he wasn't going to

527
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:10,720
make it if if if they left that day

528
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:14,640
unsatisfied or confused or uncertain or

529
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,840
not wanting to comply or whatever okay

530
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,080
spirit said he's not going to make it I

531
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,640
had that hanging over my head and this

532
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,760
is 25 years ago had it hanging over my

533
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,279
head like a lot of things that hung over

534
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,640
my head with knowing too much but the

535
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,360
point is

536
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,679
is that chocolate saved his life saved

537
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,159
his life so as much as you see I don't

538
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
really talk about chocolate too much I

539
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,000
have one recipe in life-changing Foods

540
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,480
where there's a little bit chocolate

541
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,799
involved I think it's a pomegranate

542
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,600
recipe I don't know if you guys know it

543
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,520
and stuff like that and fine I think you

544
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,360
know I support it it's okay I have it in

545
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,039
the book but I'm saying if you know if

546
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,919
you really feel sick and you got a lot

547
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,039
of problems keep it minimum don't do a

548
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,559
lot of it you could do like the

549
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,279
pomegranate recipe or something or do

550
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,880
something once in a while don't tank it

551
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,520
every day or don't have it you know like

552
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,720
five times a week but addiction wise for

553
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,360
espcially coming off the heavy stuff

554
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,320
they heavy drugs the stuff that seems

555
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,080
inconceivable to break for so many

556
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,840
reasons more than one two three four

557
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,840
five reasons so many the chocolate can

558
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,679
be a savior in certain situation you see

559
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,960
that's my love hate with it but I'm just

560
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,279
letting you know that's why you know

561
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,159
certain things that's why people say to

562
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,600
me hey don't you love don't you love uh

563
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,840
don't you love this diet don't you love

564
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,240
this diet don't you love this diet it's

565
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,159
like yeah but if you got something wrong

566
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,600
with you not going to be good if you you

567
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,000
know if you got a kidney disease you

568
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,120
should not be eating steak or you will

569
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,919
die early bottom line bottom line I was

570
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,120
taught that by Spirit if you got a

571
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,279
kidney disease you got a kidney issue

572
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,039
you should not eat chicken or steak or

573
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:51,520
any Animal product you have to be 100%

574
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:54,760
plant-based if you have a kidney problem

575
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,919
on any level you have to be 100%

576
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,360
plant-based or you will may you may not

577
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,640
not make it with a kidney disease bad

578
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,720
kidney disease you have to back down the

579
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,400
animal products with kidney diseases

580
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Spirit taught me that a long time ago so

581
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,760
it's not about what diet to choose it's

582
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
what's right when you're dealing with

583
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,720
stuff if you're suffering from viral

584
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,080
issues like Epstein bar anything like

585
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,559
that you don't want to feed the virus

586
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,919
why do you think I always say don't have

587
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,400
eggs don't have dairy don't have eggs

588
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,679
don't have dairy because you'll feed a

589
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,600
virus and stay sick because it's not

590
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,159
because I hate eggs that much you guys

591
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,840
know my history I wanted to run an egg

592
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:31,799
Shack when I was a child you know flip

593
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,240
flipping you know flipping omelets all

594
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,600
right but you know my dream never came

595
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,240
true I had to stick with this instead so

596
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,640
the bottom line is is that you know it's

597
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,440
about what's right for you at the time

598
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,440
and whether I you know like chocolate or

599
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,080
not at the time I knew when to take that

600
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,679
bar off the shelf for Cole to save his

601
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,480
life his spirit said that will be

602
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,600
medicine for his situation um so a

603
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,320
little bit about that just just know you

604
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,360
guys hanging in there get your feet seat

605
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,279
bels on I don't even think you even put

606
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:08,039
your seat bels on yet we got a little

607
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,360
ways to go um so addictions to Salt

608
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,919
isn't that interesting do you know

609
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,720
anybody that's like hey I'm addicted to

610
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,440
Salt I got this salt thing where can't

611
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,600
get enough salt can't get enough salt

612
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,720
okay because the reason why is because

613
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,360
neurotransmitters run on sodium this

614
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,760
doesn't mean you got to go and start

615
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,840
tanking down salt every day this doesn't

616
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,520
mean I just gave you the salt Freedom

617
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,360
key all right that's not what that means

618
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,799
I don't mind a little Himalayan rock

619
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,760
salt or Mountain salt or something like

620
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,600
that that's on your food or high quality

621
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,440
sea salt I get it you know Salt's okay

622
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,840
and and it is okay the neurotransmitters

623
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,240
which are talked about in part one which

624
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,720
get get interference from heavy metals

625
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,240
which cause like bulimia which cause

626
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
like anorexia you know things like that

627
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,360
those the heavy metals that get in the

628
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,279
way of like like the whole B addiction

629
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,760
that whole you know feeling like that I

630
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,320
talked about feeling that you have to

631
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,320
relieve yourself of every content in

632
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:09,200
your stomach the minute you eat because

633
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,360
what's happening there is that what

634
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,480
starts that what starts something like

635
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,640
that is the toxic heavy metals in the

636
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,559
brain Mercury being the number one so

637
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,440
when Mercury interferes with

638
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:22,039
neurotransmitters in in a certain part

639
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,760
of the brain it actually causes a

640
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:28,799
bulimic condition and then even if those

641
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,080
heavy metals are removed or something

642
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,919
Alters where you outgrow it brain tissue

643
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,760
develops you know say you're in your

644
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,200
youth you're you're a teenager and

645
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,200
you're having bulimia or something like

646
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,520
that volic condition what happens is

647
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,200
that even if your brain tissue outows

648
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,320
heavy metal and you get by you bypass

649
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,480
that you're going to be addicted to your

650
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,279
own adrenaline the reason why the

651
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,240
vomiting thing is so hard to break with

652
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,640
the Bing conditions the reason why is

653
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,440
back to what I was saying before the

654
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,360
adrenaline itself the adrenaline surge

655
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,880
you get before you vomit you can get

656
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,880
addicted to it's euphoric I talked about

657
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,159
in part one it's absolutely euphoric and

658
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:10,159
because it's euphoric it's like a a drug

659
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,720
all in its own in fact a powerful drug

660
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,279
never underestimate the power of this

661
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,120
drug The Surge of adrenaline that occurs

662
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,720
and so our addiction to Adrenaline can

663
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,039
happen with so many different illnesses

664
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,679
and I know some of you are thinking oh

665
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,559
that's well that's sounds crazy you know

666
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,960
I know someone who's who's who's bulimic

667
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,600
and it's because they were abused or

668
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,640
were yeah no of course but but it's but

669
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,399
that's a trigger the abuse is a trigger

670
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,000
you know a mental thing going on work

671
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,799
you're under mental abuse and whatever

672
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,360
it could be your sexually Abus abused

673
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,440
anything going on yeah that's that's a

674
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,399
severe trigger which then causes that

675
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,600
that neurological problem which you you

676
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:52,000
you you vomit but the adrenaline itself

677
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,039
afterwards becomes the weapon it becomes

678
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,559
the addiction and that's why people

679
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,279
struggle with that it's it's the same

680
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,279
thing with uh varieties of anorexia what

681
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,039
happens is there's an adrenaline surgent

682
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,159
occurs when you look at food especially

683
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,919
if you have if you've been abused about

684
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,039
food or something has happened about

685
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,519
food and you know you're sitting at a

686
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:13,640
table and food gets put in front of you

687
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,760
your adrenaline starts surging and that

688
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,159
adrenaline becomes your food becomes the

689
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,200
drug so you don't need to eat so you

690
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,919
literally lose your appetite immediately

691
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,279
because adrenaline is surging through

692
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,760
your system at a high rate and no one

693
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,200
talks about this this is information

694
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,799
that's never been out there anywhere it

695
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,960
doesn't exist it's like most of the

696
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,480
information that that we talk about on

697
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,720
the show so if your first time on the

698
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,360
show realize you're going to hear stuff

699
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,480
you're never going to hear anybody else

700
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,279
anywhere else um and uh and there's a

701
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,640
reason for that lots of reasons if you

702
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,559
don't know anything about me look into

703
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,360
me um and uh so so okay so I wanted to

704
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,320
cover that a little bit deeper such a

705
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,600
serious situation and and so the key is

706
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,720
is when

707
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,240
someone's um getting older and they

708
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,480
realize they got the the condition where

709
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,960
the Bic or anorexic anorexic condition

710
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,279
of any kind what happens is and I say

711
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,000
any kind because there's different

712
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:08,039
varieties there's no there's no one

713
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,880
variety of these so many different

714
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:13,679
varieties for for many reasons knowing

715
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,279
knowing that there's an adrenaline

716
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,880
addiction can save someone's life can

717
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,559
save someone's life remember how I said

718
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,159
at the beginning here you may not have

719
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,120
the this the voice that I hear perfectly

720
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:28,279
clear on the outside of the ear in real

721
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,640
time you may not have that option okay

722
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,519
because it just doesn't exist you may

723
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,799
not have the option so how about getting

724
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,399
the information from that voice that can

725
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,240
save your life or save someone's life or

726
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,880
somebody you know it it matters that's

727
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,840
what I was saying earlier so so the deal

728
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,880
is is that back to mineral salts with

729
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,840
this mineral salts play a role in in

730
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,600
Breaking adrenaline addictions so so

731
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,240
what happens is we get people that are

732
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,880
addicted to Salt because they're using

733
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,840
the adrenals too much and doesn't mean

734
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
they have

735
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,200
something like

736
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,480
anorexia or they have lmia or they have

737
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,240
um you know they're addicted to

738
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,480
something else whatever it it just means

739
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,679
that if they have that salt thing going

740
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,440
on they could get more addict addictive

741
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,440
in different ways for different reasons

742
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,679
the assault addiction is a sign that

743
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,000
your body's craving your

744
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,519
neurotransmitters are craving lots and

745
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,519
lots of mineral

746
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,399
salts and mineral salts do protect the

747
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:29,159
adrenals in ways that are unbelievable

748
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,600
so it's it's it's about the big time a

749
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,960
big part of the adrenals why do you

750
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,320
think I offer the adrenal snacks the

751
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,600
adrenal snacks a celery stick right and

752
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,679
so that's why we offer those adrenal

753
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,519
snacks like celery stick one date so

754
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,360
it's potassium in the date it's

755
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,880
micromineral sodiums in the celery

756
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,159
combined to the

757
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,799
neurotransmitter okay but not only to

758
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:55,080
the neurotransmitter to the

759
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,559
adrenal and um and they protect us

760
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,639
protecting our adrenals is a big part of

761
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,480
breaking addictions cuz when you don't

762
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:05,360
protect the adrenals the addictions can

763
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,240
come on like a like a lion like a tiger

764
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,639
like like a monster tigers and lions are

765
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,880
monsters you know what I mean like a

766
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,440
Monster can just come on like that and

767
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,000
so we have to protect we have to so back

768
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:23,360
to eating every hour hour and a half

769
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,880
small meals if we can eating small meals

770
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,720
small meals and they matter um these

771
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,639
little snacks all through the day celery

772
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:38,480
stick uh date okay um some berries uh

773
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:40,799
cucumber sizes um you know anything like

774
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,440
that I could you could look up all my my

775
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,360
my snacks that that I offer in so many

776
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,639
different ways including the blog and

777
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:52,880
everything um so mineral salts are

778
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:55,799
needed someone has the salt addiction

779
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,639
they're desperately needing mineral

780
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,080
salts to the brain into the

781
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:03,799
adrenals all right where can you get

782
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,320
those mineral salts too spinach leafy

783
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:07,919
greens spinach especially spinach celery

784
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,360
especially celery which is an herb but

785
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,840
spinach leafy green the sodium content

786
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,440
in spinach is the kind that really works

787
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,519
versus getting the hit from that that

788
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,360
Himalayan salt or or that fake salt in

789
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:27,919
junk food you know or road salt in junk

790
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:30,720
junk food those don't really cut

791
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,919
meaning they don't get to the neuron

792
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,840
they don't get to that neuron where the

793
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,000
electrical pulse impulse runs through it

794
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,159
like I explained part one and so so it's

795
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,639
always important to understand that um

796
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,039
you need real mineral salts from the

797
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:48,919
celery by the way the mineral salts and

798
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,799
celery are undiscovered before you all

799
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:54,200
of a sudden say oh we know sodium is in

800
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:56,840
in celery it's salty it's it's science

801
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,440
already has it no science doesn't sorry

802
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,480
they don't okay they know there's sodium

803
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,639
in celery they don't know it's comprised

804
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,240
of micromineral salt different sodiums

805
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,080
different variety of sodiums that aren't

806
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,679
even labeled listed in science and

807
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,200
research under the lab because nobody

808
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,000
cares no one wants to learn meaning and

809
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,440
no one it's there's not like tons of

810
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,600
funding going in to figure out what's

811
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,000
inside celery I promise you that there

812
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,159
isn't hundreds of millions of dollars

813
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,120
going into celery all right to figure

814
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,760
out what's in it all right but it's got

815
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,000
these micromineral salts comprise

816
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,440
subgroups com I even talk about it in

817
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,039
life-changing Foods a little bit um so

818
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,080
pick up life-changing foods you can even

819
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,399
get more obviously more

820
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,240
information um so all right let's go

821
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,799
let's keep on going through this so

822
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,960
sodium addiction because your

823
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,919
neurotransmitters need the salt your

824
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,720
adrenals need the salt well the

825
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:51,320
micromineral salts okay and then sugar

826
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,519
addiction because your brain needs the

827
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,679
glucose and your liver needs the glucose

828
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,799
all right and so we're going to cross

829
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,399
that threshold a little bit more today

830
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,760
on the sugar

831
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,320
addiction how do you stay addicted to

832
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,159
Sugar you meaning addicted to bad sugar

833
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,200
how do you stay addicted to bad sugar by

834
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,960
having bad fat mixed with it ice cream

835
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,639
that right there will will make sure

836
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,320
that no glucose gets to your brain and

837
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,240
liver you'll starve your brain and liver

838
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,320
and because of the fats in the ice cream

839
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,119
will stop that sugar that glucose from

840
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,240
getting into the brain and the liver see

841
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,119
what happens is the wrong fats and too

842
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,639
much

843
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,240
fat stops sugar from going to where it

844
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,639
needs to go into cells into muscles into

845
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,839
the heart into the brain into the liver

846
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,960
no one talks about that out there it's

847
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,000
like it's like disheartening it's all

848
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,679
about high fat high fat high fat high

849
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,679
fat no sugar high fat no sugar that's

850
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,520
ridiculous in a million ways I can't

851
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,520
even tell you guys I'm not talking about

852
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,480
um you know Silly lowfat diets I'm

853
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,079
talking about the right kind of fats the

854
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,320
right amounts depending on what's going

855
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,880
on with you depending on what's

856
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,760
Happening and if you got a sugar

857
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,800
addiction if you need you know if if you

858
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,280
feel like you you're on sweets all the

859
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,359
time you're missing glycogen and glucose

860
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,920
to the brain you're missing which which

861
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,040
all this leads to addictions sugar

862
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,079
addictions because you want more and

863
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,119
more of the bad sugar cuz the sugar

864
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,520
won't go in the right place so you going

865
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,520
more and more Donuts more and more

866
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,880
uh cookies more and more danishes more

867
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,200
and more Bagels more and more I don't

868
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
know whatever just whatever what kind of

869
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,599
what kind of candy do you guys like kind

870
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,680
of sugar do you guys like it's got to be

871
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,160
switched over to dates it's got to be

872
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,119
switched over to fruits it's got to be

873
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,119
switched over to raw honey sugars that

874
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,920
are the healthy sugars okay the healthy

875
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,720
sugars for sure maybe some Fuji apples

876
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,960
maybe some braver and apples uh maybe

877
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,520
some galala apples um you know maybe

878
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,720
some arom apples if you can find them

879
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,960
somewhere in an orchard somewhere else

880
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,960
at the end of the year but but the point

881
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,079
is is that the right kind of sugar can

882
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,280
get to the brain and stop sugar

883
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,920
addictions but it needs to make sure

884
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,160
that you're not eating the wrong kind of

885
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,760
fats too high in fat that you're not

886
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,520
like filled with with with nothing but

887
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,960
too many uh of the wrong omegas the

888
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,680
Omega-3s are really important and

889
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,760
getting them in the right sources are

890
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,760
critical when it comes down to making

891
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,720
sure sugar absorbs the correct way so

892
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,200
let's go over some of the right fats

893
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,040
hemp seeds that's the right kind of fat

894
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,880
but you don't want a whole full bag of

895
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,000
hemp seeds a day cuz then it's going to

896
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,319
be so much fat or you don't want a big

897
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,319
container of hemp butter it's going to

898
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:48,359
be so much fat it's going to stop the

899
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:50,359
right kind of sugar from getting to the

900
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,520
brain and restoring the brain so you

901
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,920
don't fall into any kind of addiction I

902
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,200
don't care what the addiction is you

903
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,599
could fall into it you see and making

904
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,240
sure the right kind of sugar gets into

905
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,560
the liver that then what I mean by Sugar

906
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,480
I mean glucose sto restoring glycogen

907
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,599
deposits restoring carbohydrate deposits

908
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,839
in the brain and in in the liver now I'm

909
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,960
touching upon a lot of this in this

910
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:15,760
little area because I know on part one

911
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,880
when I said the brain is made out of

912
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,960
carbohydrates I meant it it is but

913
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,319
there's going to be a lot there's going

914
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,200
to be an anger Fest because of that

915
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,160
because right now there's misinformation

916
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:30,880
the brain is all fat the whole thing on

917
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,800
the brain being filled with fat is is

918
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,160
complete misinformation and a total

919
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,160
misconception there are micro deposits

920
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,520
of fats in the brain that are Omega-3s

921
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,920
but here's the thing not just

922
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,319
Omega-3s okay

923
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,760
oils that aren't even on record one of

924
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,240
the oils on record in the brain is

925
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,200
swalling okay that's one of the oils on

926
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,160
record in science and research that's in

927
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:04,000
the brain is squalling all right that's

928
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:06,280
a micro that's a micro fat micro fat the

929
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,720
brain isn't made of fat or filled with

930
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:14,800
fat it's got these really tiny

931
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:17,240
little micro omegas hidden in certain

932
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,480
areas of the brain undiscovered by

933
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,520
science and research squalene is one of

934
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,920
them but that is discovered that is

935
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,280
discovered by science and research thank

936
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,480
God okay because it gives us hope but

937
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,520
there's all kinds of subgroups of these

938
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,440
Omega-3s guess where you get them

939
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,920
watermelon seeds when you eat your

940
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,079
watermelon you bite your seed and you

941
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,599
chew it up that's where you get it you

942
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:46,160
ready hem seeds all right and you ready

943
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,760
butterleaf lettuce butterleaf

944
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,960
lettuce in butterleaf lettuce there's

945
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,800
these micro fats and the there's these

946
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Omega-3s that that do go to the brain

947
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,960
it's not a hunk of fat or it's not fats

948
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,599
it's different it's like a micro Omega

949
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,640
that's got a viscosity that's so thin

950
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,119
that it won't even constitute as a fat

951
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,400
or seem it or or be like it and it's not

952
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,000
a lot of it not a lot of it even really

953
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,839
small amounts that get into the brain

954
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,839
all right and blackberry seeds the seeds

955
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,480
of a Blackberry tomato seeds when you

956
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:29,319
eat your tomato there's seeds in the

957
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,480
tomato that seed has an omega-3

958
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:32,839
undocumented by research in science by

959
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,760
food research and Science and any kind

960
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:36,720
of research in science and that's the

961
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,359
kind that goes to the brain in said

962
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,319
people are loading up on all this bad

963
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:42,119
fat all kinds of crappy fat everywhere

964
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,280
and I'm just talking about fried grease

965
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,640
and all that I'm talking about what

966
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,400
people think is healthy fat they got it

967
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
stacked to the brim they're being told

968
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,880
it's healthy and they're losing the

969
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,280
glucose reserves in their brain and it

970
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,839
could set you up for some serious

971
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,079
Alzheimer's but not just that addictions

972
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,480
if you're trying to break any kind of

973
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,440
addiction

974
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,400

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,280
so I'm giving you detailed information

976
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,599
so that you're not leaving here confused

knowing what's what's right yeah and I

982
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,079
have the right to say that because of my

983
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,359
source other than that I wouldn't have

984
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,960
the right to say that I'd be just

985
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,640
swimming on the internet looking for

986
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,760
misinformation being like well I don't

987
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,280
know I guess I'll follow this but I'm

988
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,040
lucky I'm blessed and that blessing that

989
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,400
I have I want to share with you bottom

990
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,280
line so you understand so what that

991
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,520
means is that so whether you're you know

992
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,240
eating a meat eating diet or just a

993
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,280
straight vegetarian diet or vegan diet

994
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,000
whatever it is keep the fats low for

995
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,960
bringing more butter lettuce mashe MH I

996
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,160
talked about it in the last episode um

997
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,560
get some watermelon seeds you know

998
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,119
they're out there you can buy them and

999
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,599
eat them you know have them in the

1000
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,319
watermelon some hemp seeds sesame seeds

1001
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,760
have a little bit of it you some sesame

1002
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,920
seeds some tahini make sure these are

1003
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,599
mixed in whatever diet You' got so if

1004
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,200
you're eating turkey make sure you also

1005
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,720
have some of these things mixed in if

1006
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,560
you're not eating any kind of animal

1007
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,480
product make sure you got you know these

1008
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,480
in there which you probably most likely

1009
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,720
do because you got more room for it but

1010
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,839
so that's and and what does this play

1011
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,400
like a role in where and how I'll tell

1012
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,000
you it plays a role by halting

1013
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,359
addictions when you get enough glucose

1014
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,119
to the brain and and the liver your

1015
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,319
liver is not going to be starving for it

1016
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,160
your brain's not going to be starving

1017
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:34,960
for it and you're not going to go into

1018
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,079
deep into addictions of all kinds and

1019
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,640
you're also going to have protection

1020
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,520
against adrenaline surges that can get

1021
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,160
you addicted to anything addicted to

1022
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,880
literally

1023
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,920
anything okay very important to know

1024
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,000
very important to know and you don't

1025
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,319
want to be addicted to Danger okay I I I

1026
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,680
I recently told a story about when I was

1027
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,280
in my childhood on my street and

1028
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,599
everybody looked at me because they knew

1029
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,920
I would do things a little bit more

1030
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,200
daring because I heard a voice and the

1031
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,800
voice The Voice made me kind of what

1032
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,839
would be um you know not unstop

1033
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:14,599
stoppable but indestructible or whatever

1034
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,599
it is and you know I was considered

1035
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,680
superhero in my childhood because of

1036
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,559
what the voice would say like like

1037
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,240
diagnosing uh a friend's mom of diabetes

1038
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,559
or whatever it was and and what what

1039
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,960
happened is because that I also felt

1040
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,599
like I can do anything so I would do

1041
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,760
things that were dared devilish dared

1042
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,839
devilish but I found during those

1043
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,160
Daredevil causes um going against Spirit

1044
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,520
of course I found that the adrenaline

1045
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,400
ride in it D like Daredevil anything

1046
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,079
jumping on a bungee cord I mean with a

1047
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,319
bungee cord attached to you which I've

1048
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:53,000
never done but anything like that you

1049
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,160
can get addicted to Adrenaline and then

1050
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,440
okay fine what does that mean that means

1051
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,480
you might all of a sudden SE drinking

1052
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,640
too much coffee and never be able to

1053
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,480
break it you might be you might be you

1054
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,680
know um you know doing some kind of uh

1055
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,760
amphetamine that's prescription you

1056
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,559
can't break it you might be able to you

1057
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,680
might not be able to break a sugar bad

1058
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:14,559
sugar diet you might not not even to

1059
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,720
break a whatever and so whatever that is

1060
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,240
cigarettes and so forth I want to tell

1061
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,960
you a little cigarette pack trick

1062
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,800
cigarette I call it the cigarette pack

1063
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,880
trick I think I might even talked about

1064
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,839
in one of the episodes possibly going uh

1065
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,800
going all the way back last here maybe

1066
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:32,160
maybe longer um one way to to to can

1067
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,480
give you some information on how to

1068
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,319
break cigarettes first of all the reason

1069
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,880
why you're smoking cigarettes is because

1070
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,000
cigarettes activate adrenaline they shut

1071
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,760
off your

1072
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,200
appetite um they they you know you ever

1073
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,480
hear about hey when people get off of

1074
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,480
cigarettes they get off the nicotine

1075
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,280
they start eating more have you been

1076
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,960
through that in your life that's because

1077
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,640
um the adrenaline surges are calming

1078
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,920
down you're not you're not getting that

1079
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,160
adrenaline amped up

1080
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,760
so one way and here another reason why

1081
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,920
people get addicted to smoking isn't

1082
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,920
just because of nicotine being a drug um

1083
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,160
it's

1084
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,359
because cigarettes make you alkaline for

1085
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:14,960
a quick second a hot second they make

1086
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:17,640
you alkaline so for like 30 seconds you

1087
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:20,359
get an alkaline hit you get alkaline

1088
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,640
like it's this this this super sonic

1089
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:25,599
wave of bam you're

1090
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,960
alkaline and that happens when you smoke

1091
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,520
cigarettes

1092
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,520
and then it goes o way acidic so you

1093
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,240
need another you need another cigarette

1094
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,920
and boom to get the alkaline hit then

1095
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,200
you go way acidic then boom you get the

1096
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,800
alkaline hit then you go away acidic and

1097
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,319
um because the coal that's

1098
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:49,200
burning when when it's in

1099
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:52,200
between of being fresh tobacco and then

1100
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,040
burnt tobacco a chemical compound

1101
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,559
develops in between that nobody knows

1102
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,359
about once again undiscovered by

1103
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:02,359
research science that becomes so

1104
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,440
alkaline so alkaline it's off the chart

1105
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,960
it's this one split

1106
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,720
0.00000000 Point whatever 1% of time

1107
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,040
that this chemical ignites but it

1108
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,839
ignites between the fresh tobacco and

1109
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,640
the burning tobacco and right when it

1110
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:21,960
poofs right when it ignites right there

1111
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,400
you end up getting it into the system

1112
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,319
and it is more powerful than 10 million

1113
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
tons of nicotine that's being you know

1114
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,520
that's being exagger exag I'm

1115
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,559
exaggerating on that of course whatever

1116
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,319
um but it's so amped up and it gives you

1117
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,680
an alkaline hit to the

1118
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,599
brain not into the lung to the brain

1119
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,920
right away and that's out what you're

1120
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,520
hooked on nobody knows nobody know they

1121
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,160
think it's nicotine nicotine is just an

1122
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:53,680
aspect of it it's this alkaline hit

1123
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,599
that's what it is and so so when you

1124
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,760
know when that's occurring it's hard to

1125
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,000
break break it also you got the

1126
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,480
adrenaline rush cuz every time you go

1127
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,680
into your pack of cigarettes and you're

1128
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,599
about to pull out a smoke a Sig your

1129
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,520
adrenaline starts running and if it's

1130
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,960
held back from you a little longer your

1131
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,920
adrenaline runs more and if you can't

1132
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,200
get to your break time at work go

1133
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,839
outside and you know wherever you're

1134
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,200
working whether it's you know a store or

1135
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,559
factory or whatever you do in your life

1136
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,200
whatever and you want to get a break or

1137
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,319
you work in a hotel and you want to step

1138
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,480
out in the back of the hotel or a

1139
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:29,000
restaurant you want to get a cigarette

1140
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,640
and you miss that break and you got to

1141
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,680
wait for the next break your adrenaline

1142
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,760
starts running more and more and more

1143
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,280
and you won't even want food your

1144
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,480
adrenaline's pumping through your veins

1145
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,200
remember I told you about the two big

1146
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,960
groups in part one if you haven't heard

1147
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,440
part one you got to hear part one you

1148
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,760
got to find part one I'm I'm I'm asking

1149
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,240
you find part

1150
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,040
one after this after this one um so what

1151
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,240
happens is that two groups is that group

1152
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:59,280
is adrenaline the other one's glucose so

1153
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,040
you're sitting there and you're waiting

1154
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,559
and adrenaline's running more and more

1155
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,480
as soon as you get that cigarette out

1156
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,040
your adrenaline's fired up and running

1157
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,760
and then you get the hit and then boom

1158
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,400
you're alkaline for 30 seconds that's

1159
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,119
what happens of course you'll have also

1160
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,200
a nicotine with TR withdrawal off of

1161
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,280
nicotine that is real but it's only part

1162
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,559
of it you guys part of it so what's a

1163
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,960
good cigarette trick here's what you got

1164
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,400
to do here's where I like chocolate once

1165
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,119
again good old chocolate Spirit taught

1166
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,160
me this trick for people okay all right

1167
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,079
so you got two packs of cigarettes you

1168
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,680
empty one of them so you empty one of

1169
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:37,800
the packs so it's empty well you should

1170
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,480
empty the other pack too because you're

1171
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,680
only going to put 10 cigarettes in that

1172
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,119
pack not 20 so you're going to put 10

1173
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,480
cigarettes back in that pack the other

1174
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:46,720
pack that you emptied completely you're

1175
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,599
going to fill with little pieces of

1176
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,079
chocolate the little pieces little

1177
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:52,839
pieces from the little chocolate bar not

1178
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,000
the big one I talked about earlier

1179
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:55,880
you're going to fill that with little

1180
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,760
pieces of chocolate you're going to

1181
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,200
stock it okay and what you're going to

1182
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,920
do is you're going to have every time

1183
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,240
you get that adrenaline surge that

1184
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,240
adrenaline surge is coming on like babbe

1185
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,240
that adrenaline surge is is coming on

1186
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,800
and and you know it and it's break time

1187
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,559
and you're about to have your cigarette

1188
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,920
or whatever it is you pull out a piece

1189
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:17,240
of chocolate out of the the empty pack

1190
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,599
that that was filled with chocolate

1191
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,480
pieces it even soaks up some of that

1192
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,839
nicotine believe it or not cuz nicotine

1193
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,119
is is

1194
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:27,720
aromatic and and soaks up some of that

1195
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,839
tobacco everything else so that the

1196
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,280
chocolate pieces and if you do this

1197
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,440
ahead of time your chocolate pieces will

1198
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,240
soak up a good aroma of cigarettes by

1199
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,599
the way so you pop one or two little

1200
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,880
pieces in your

1201
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,400
mouth and you don't chew them up and

1202
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,200
swallow them right away you leave them

1203
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,839
in your mouth as long as they can until

1204
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,200
they melt until they take their time

1205
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:49,920
it's all the way to the bank you do that

1206
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,559
all right and then the next time you

1207
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,400
have a cigarette out of your 10 your 10

1208
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,720
cigarette pack and you break down you

1209
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,000
cut your cigarettes down in half you cut

1210
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,720
them down in half you could do five

1211
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,880
cigarettes you could be whatever daring

1212
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,720
level you think you are start at 15

1213
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,920
cigarettes whatever you might be doing

1214
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,480
and you keep both packs on you another

1215
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,760
secret weapon is never smoke

1216
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,880
inside smoke outside always smoke

1217
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,079
outside but that's not all only smoke

1218
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,640
when you're

1219
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,839
walking if you can try that one it's a

1220
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,160
Sure Shot way to quit only smoke while

1221
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,520
walking you'll take less drags and

1222
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,280
you'll get less you know addictive

1223
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,440
nicotine like we're talking about and

1224
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,079
other stuff going on it's all going to

1225
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,599
be calming down a bit because you're

1226
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,160
gonna be walking you're going to be

1227
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:40,559
walking off your smoking habit because

1228
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:43,640
it's hard to smoke while walking it's

1229
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,760
harder versus just standing there or

1230
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,480
being outside so that's another

1231
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,040
technique is you have to do the walking

1232
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,520
while smoking thing and what you can do

1233
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,359
is get more oxygen in you because you're

1234
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,280
walking and yeah so that's the other

1235
00:49:56,359 --> 00:50:00,520
trick plus with the the you know the

1236
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,599
packs so these are the two you know two

1237
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,119
very powerful ways you do them combined

1238
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,520

taking that

1242
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,520
walk and you're smoking less cigarette

1243
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,960
you're ad Dre adrenaline that's pumping

1244
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,440
you're not just standing there while

1245
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,400
adrenaline is pumping making you a

1246
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,000

1260
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,000
covered the mineral salts covered the

1261
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,799
sweet brain stuff a little bit very

1262
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,040
important cover the eating every two

1263
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,520
hours to hour and a half that can help

1264
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,400
stop any addiction any percentage you

1265
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,760
get out of the show any trick or any

1266
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,040
piece of information that's powerful

1267
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,680
okay it's powerful I'm going to go

1268
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:14,520
through one thing spiritually for just a

1269
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,119
few seconds there's also spiritual

1270
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:20,200
energy that's at hand with addictions

1271
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:23,680
okay you know I hate going into this

1272
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,079
land too much but we have angels and

1273
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,319
those angels are there for us and we

1274
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,559
need to call upon them and I don't hate

1275
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:31,200
going into the angel thing I love it we

1276
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:33,160
know because you know there's angel I

1277
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,680
have two Angel chapters in you know in

1278
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,240
my books I have an angel chapter in book

1279
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,760
one book two uh life-changing angels I

1280
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,880
just you know we just you guys know

1281
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,040
about now which are really incredible to

1282
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,960
have on your side especially even with

1283
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,839
with eating problems or

1284
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,040
anything but there's also negative

1285
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,240
energies out there there's just negative

1286
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:55,559
energy out there I'll just simplify it

1287
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,200
those negative energies love addictions

1288
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:02,240
love people that are trapped in

1289
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,440
addictions be aware that there's just

1290
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,000
psychic energy out there that there's

1291
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,920
psychic energy out there that that that

1292
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,599
just that just magnetically likes to be

1293
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,920
involved with

1294
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,640
addictions okay there's something that

1295
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,480
um that you know how the alcohol is

1296
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,160
called spirits you probably heard that

1297
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,960
before but guess who started that one I

1298
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,880
started that one 30 years ago 30 years

1299
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,839
ago I started that one that one came

1300
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,400
from me if you ever I always say there's

1301
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,520
stuff that has gone around and come

1302
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,160
around and it came from me real early on

1303
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,160
I could even prove that one I have that

1304
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,799
one in writing 30 years ago and what

1305
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,599
happens is that that whole Spirit thing

1306
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:42,000
involved with Spirits with alcohol why

1307
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,760
we call them Spirits or why they've been

1308
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
called spirits is for that reason

1309
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,640
because Spirits do or an energy does

1310
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,040
come around when we're trashing

1311
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,280
ourselves in any way possible whatever

1312
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,200
that might be I mean even if it's on the

1313
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,799
most mildest level so just be aware that

1314
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,160
you want to cut out that negativity you

1315
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:02,480
want to cut out those negative energies

1316
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,079
you don't want to let them feed off of

1317
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,799
your addictions too as well whatever

1318
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:09,000
that might be so I just wanted to pop

1319
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:13,319
