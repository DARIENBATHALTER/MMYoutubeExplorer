240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,240
and you can't bring your book one of

241
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,839

it could be for anybody if you want but

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,360
it's for people who have traveling a

246
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,680
long way possibly and they just can't

247
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,959
bring a book and so forth it's too much

248
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,440
on the travel or you forget at least you

249
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,480

253
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,760
and I'm going to be talking and yeah

254
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,399
this is this is like a once in lifetime

255
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,839
thing for sure I that's all I could say

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,120
and I've never done a book signing

257
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
before ever so I'm just saying right now

258
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,040
that's another thing too brenon says is

259
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,959

260
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,399

261
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,480
close yep I'm not going to say too much

262
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,320
but it is definitely very exciting and

263
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,399

266
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,399
possible there will be because what

267
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,279
we're hearing and what little birdies

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,839
are telling us is some people are coming

269
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,600

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,639
people there and so this thing is

271
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,360

to be thirsty I'm going to be thirsty

278
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to probably grab a few of them

279
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,360
and tank them down and I'll just tank

280
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,360
them down in front of you guys because

281
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,120
that's probably what's going to happen

282
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,240
is you'll be seeing me tank them down

283
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,320
I'll show you how I drink them in person

284
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,800
in like real time in person I'll show

285
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,720
you how I drink them down

286
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,680
it's probably not the best way to do it

287
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,600
you know cuz I don't take my time I just

288
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,320
chug them okay we also have a camera

289
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,959
crew there interviewing the community on

290
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,000
their healing stories if you guys want

291
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,519
to do that make sure you sign up to get

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,079
more details which is really cool

293
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,279
there's so many cool things happening

294
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,959
anyway you guys I am pumped I am excited

295
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,519
so let's get on with it I want to talk

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,959
about some metals a little bit if you

297
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,800
guys don't mind it's critical to get

298
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,240
toxic heavy metals out of the body

299
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,160
that's why the heavy metal detox has

300
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,959
been so powerful and has helped people

301
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,160
move forward to such a degree and you

302
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:11,120
know it's

303
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,360
critical to remove metals because bugs

304
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,040
love Metals we're going to go into that

305
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,800
a little bit sound exciting it is

306
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,240
exciting understanding how it works like

307
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,519
when metals are in our body and they

308
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,000
enter our body every single day when

309
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,199
you're pumping gas at the at the gas

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,680
station metals are entering our lungs

311
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:36,160
and in our body you can smell them at

312
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,920
the gas station if you're driving an EV

313
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,040
uhhuh metals leeching from the battery

314
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,680
the 600 lb battery sitting underneath

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,600
your butt so metals are everywhere

316
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,000
doesn't matter if you got an EV it

317
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,160
doesn't matter if you're breathing in

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,680
the smog that's choking out of a car we

319
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,480
bring breathe in metals all the time we

320
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,040
inherit them from generations and

321
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,120
generations a people so we inherit these

322
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,320
Metals all the time and then we also

323
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,480
inherit pathogens as well we inherit

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,040
those that's a virus right there and

325
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,680
viruses love to eat metal so we're going

326
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,639
to go into that a little bit the whole

327
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,920
thing so let's cut into it and then when

328
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,000
that happens our immune system gets

329
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,440
burdened our immune system that's an

330
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,639
immune cell right there our immune

331
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,920
system gets burdened when we have too

332
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,760
many metals in us and pathogens are

333
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,120
feeding off of those metals so let's get

334
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,680
into it a little bit okay so let's

335
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,079
create a nice toxic heavy metal patch

336
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,560
right here a nice toxic heavy metal

337
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,320
patch right here one here okay we'll put

338
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,600
a few different ones around if you guys

339
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,440
don't mind all right you guys can see

340
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,160
that

341
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,040
right there we go and then we're going

342
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,079
to

343
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,680
put a pathogen a pathogen here we go

344
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,880
look we're going to put some spikes on

345
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,759
this pathogen how about that put some

346
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,839
spikes on this one too

347
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,800
all right we got some pathogens in the

348
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,160
bloodstream we got pathogens in the

349
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,759
organs we got them in the liver how

350
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,519
about that so we got some viruses right

351
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,079
here and then we also have different

352
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:15,560
kinds of pathogens too so let's do a

353
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,680
little bit of that here's a different

354
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,079
one okay all kinds of different bugs are

355
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,199
inside of everybody you want to know why

356
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,279
everybody's sick bugs and toxins what

357
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,639
are some of the toxins toxic heavy

358
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:33,839
metals bugs and toxins are why people

359
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,680
are sick it's bugs and toxins okay so we

360
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,279
got the pathogens we got all that these

361
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,720
are the toxic heavy metals I'm just

362
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,720
going to kind of circle them a little

363
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:46,000
bit okay lead Mercury aluminum cadmium

364
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,079
toxic Metals not even just heavy I call

365
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,639
them all Heavy because they do serious

366
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,480
damage on the body all right so we we

367
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:55,680
have that right there so what you're

368
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,839
looking at is a whole bunch of circles

369
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,199
whole bunch of different spots okay but

370
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,160
this is your body this whole thing is

371
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,880
your body right here okay your body is

372
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,279
this right here and inside your body you

373
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,440
got your organs and you can you got your

374
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:15,079
bloodstream you got your brain you got

375
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:18,000
everything so what happens all right so

376
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:21,079
toxic heavy metals break down over time

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,040
keep that in mind they break down over

378
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:27,279
time Metals shed so what you're seeing

379
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,920
right here coming out of deposits of

380
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,920
metals right what what you're seeing is

381
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,920
out gassing you're seeing oxidation some

382
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,160
metals oxidate in your brain and body

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,440
keep that in mind they oxidize in your

384
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,720
liver oxidize in your pancreas you know

385
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,880
how many people are getting pancreatic

386
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,880
cancer right now it's insane it's every

387
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,920
single day this person is diagnosed with

388
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,839
panc pancreatic cancer this person is

389
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,279
pancreatic cancer this person has a

390
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,319
pancreatic tumor this person has this

391
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,079
and that it's crazy to the to the degree

392
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,720
that is happening right now out there

393
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,440
okay this person is liver cancer this

394
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,839
person is colon cancer this person is

395
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:14,519
this and that and you guys know

396
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:18,880
pathogens are those cancer cells right

397
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:23,000
viral cells turn into cancer cells

398
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:27,319
that's how it works viral cells need

399
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,319
fuel to turn into cancer cells to turn

400
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:36,440
into disease creating cells just so you

401
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:39,279
know so Metals start to out gas out

402
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,800
pocket they start to oxidize so that's

403
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,480
what these Metals do so I'm putting a

404
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,759
little bit of a butterfly around all

405
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,360
these metal all these Metals right here

406
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:48,000
okay and you'll see you see that

407
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,199
butterfly around them that's what we

408
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,880
want to call it okay I'm putting a

409
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,360
little all of this is Metals breaking

410
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,680
down so we live our life we don't get

411
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,839
enough antioxidants that's right we

412
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,400
start to oxidize we get really acidic

413
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,720
and the acid starts to break down the

414
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,559
metals they start to outp poet they

415
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,319
start to break down those are the metals

416
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,880
right there and when they do that

417
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:22,919
they're leeching and when they're

418
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,559
leeching that junk and toxic crap coming

419
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:29,440
off of them are leeching into your

420
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,679
bloodstream and into organ tissue is if

421
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,440
it's your brain they're leeching into

422
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,520
your brain tissue right just keep that

423
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
in mind okay so that's your brain right

424
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,520
there if it's your brain they're

425
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,039
leeching into brain tissue if it's your

426
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,120
organs like your liver they're leeching

427
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,039
into liver tissue okay so there's liver

428
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,880
there's the brain right there so keep

429
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,000
your eye on those because they're all

430
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,919
part of it okay so now we got the bugs

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,200
we got the pathogens we got the viruses

432
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:07,919
the viruses that create cancer the

433
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,880
viruses that create all kinds of

434
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,880
inflammation takes a pathogen to create

435
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,840
inflammation critical to understand but

436
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
a pathogen needs to stay alive and a

437
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,480
pathogen needs to eat it has to eat to

438
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,000
stay it can't just

439
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,799
exist classified medical research and

440
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,320
science keeps pathogens alive in their

441
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,679
labs using

442
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,720
mercury classified medical research and

443
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,480
science uses Mercury to keep pathogens

444
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,480
alive it's a preservative to keep

445
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,559
pathogens nice and fat and happy and

446
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,559
alive so the

447
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:48,120
pathogen the pathogen can Thrive because

448
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,720
pathogens feed off of mercury public

449
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,120
medical research and science doesn't

450
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,960
know that Medical in medical medium

451
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,799
information published all the stuff on

452
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,640
how Mercury feeds pathogens feeds

453
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,960
viruses and so forth what happens is

454
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,240
pathogens eat the Mercury then they

455
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:08,600
release neurotoxins neurotoxins give you

456
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,200
all your different Vegas nerve symptoms

457
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,080
all your different cranial nerve

458
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,799
symptoms it makes you get ticks and

459
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,760
spasms aches and pains fatigue fatigue

460
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,799
where your legs are like sandbags your

461
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,240
arms are like sandbags you can't

462
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,280
function you get the brain fog you get

463
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,880
all kinds of bizarre depression you get

464
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,360
all kinds of bizarre sadness anxiety

465
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,480
through the roof panic attacks heart

466
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,640
arrhythmias that aren't heart problems

467
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,720
but instead they're like mysterious aibs

468
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,520
and everything all these toxins related

469
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,760
to pathogens from Metals right so

470
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:46,559
classified medical research and science

471
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,880
uses Mercury as a preservative to keep a

472
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,200
pathogen alive so they could study it

473
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,640
mess with it put it back out into the

474
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,520
environment in people some way some

475
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,440
shape some form so we can just kind of

476
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
all pass around every single bug

477
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,440
everybody could even imagine like the

478
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,919
herpes family simplex one Simplex 2 um

479
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,400
all the different herpes viruses

480
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,799
shingles Epstein bar hhv6 hhv7

481
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,240
undiscovered 10 through 16 and so forth

482
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,400
all this medical medum information you

483
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,280
guys know so here's how it works right

484
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,480
you got your Metals that's this right

485
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,880
here your metal Pockets they're

486
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,640
expanding they're in your liver they're

487
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,559
in your brain these metal pockets are

488
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,440
expanding they're in your liver in your

489
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,919
brain they're in your pancreas they're

490
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,200
in your spleen yep they are they're in

491
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:44,320
your colon lining how about that in your

492
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,000
colon lining right so these are pockets

493
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,679
of metal they're expanding and

494
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,640
outgassing let's go to viruses now let's

495
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:56,120
go to

496
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:59,480
bugs everybody has a virus in them

497
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,919
everybody has one if they're the one

498
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,360
person at this point on the planet that

499
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,679
doesn't have an Epstein

500
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,960
bar then they have a

501
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,960
shingles if it's the one person on this

502
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,960
planet that doesn't have a shingles

503
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,279
variety right then they have an

504
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,799
hhv6 if it's the one person that doesn't

505
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,600
have an hhv6 they got an

506
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,159
hsv1 they got the Simplex cold sore

507
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,360
fever blister

508
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:29,880
virus goes on and on and on everyone has

509
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,960
a bug in them

510
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,360
the key is how many bugs do they have in

511
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,960
them okay do they have three or four

512
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,159
varieties of epine bar that they picked

513
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,440
up along the way because they just did

514
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,600
do they have five Epstein bars do they

515
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,400
have three shingles do they have hhv6

516
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,880
ceglar virus what do they have in them

517
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,559
do they have three varieties of cold

518
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,240
sore viruses because a lot of people

519
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,640
they don't just have one cold sore virus

520
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,279
they don't know it but they have three

521
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,440
and then they'll have a canker sore

522
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,919
virus too which is also herpetic from

523
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,760
the herpetic family but it's not the

524
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,120
cold sore virus but they'll have the

525
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,880
canker sore kker stores will come out

526
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,720
all the time and so forth

527
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,400
right everyone has a bug I'm sorry to

528
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,480
say that it's just how many do they have

529
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,559
and which varieties do they have do they

530
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,840
have two shingles in an epscene bar do

531
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,720
they not have a shingles but they have

532
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,480
an hhv7 what do they have do they have

533
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,440
hsv1 okay so we're establishing that are

534
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,600
there bugs causing problems are there

535
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,039
bugs giving them aches and pains fatigue

536
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,919
all kinds of different brain fog all

537
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,320
kinds of different anxiety depression

538
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,840
are the bugs creating all these

539
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,320
different numbness feelings and tingles

540
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,159
is it giving them um ttis and ringing

541
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,799
the ears whooing in the ears popping in

542
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,000
the ears is it giving them tightness of

543
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,240
the chest tightness of the jaw pain in

544
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,919
the back of their head what is it doing

545
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,880
is it giving them vertigo and dizzy

546
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:48,360
balance issues are they dizzy are they

547
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,080
having problems did they have a bad

548
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,440
vertigo last year that is Epstein bar by

549
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,880
the way what are they having what are

550
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,360
they dealing with so that's the next

551
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:02,400
level and then we got

552
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,400
Metals metals and I'm not talking about

553
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,520
heavy

554
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,240
metal the music I'm talking about toxic

555
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,200
heavy metals and toxic Metals which

556
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,640
people also have they inherit it from

557
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,600
the family line Mercury all the way down

558
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,919
and so forth and we collect more and

559
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,919
more metal every single day like I said

560
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,640
you just go to the gas station stick the

561
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,600
gas pump in I took celery Force by the

562
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,760
way is it

563
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,919
showing is it showing cuz I'm like you

564
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,120
stick the gas pump in you breathe in

565
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,960
those gas fumes and those gas fumes have

566
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,840
metal in them you drive your EV around

567
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
you're like hey I don't have gas in the

568
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,559
car I'm doing good this way too and

569
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,200
you're breathing in and out gas over

570
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,039
time it's coming off the battery in the

571
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,679
car right regardless we're getting

572
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,640
Metals out of the sky in all of the sea

573
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,960
Trails we're getting Metals in

574
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,919
Pharmaceuticals that a lot of people

575
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,559
take I mean they take Pharmaceuticals

576
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,039
prescribed by their doctors for

577
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,000
different things they're getting metals

578
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,520
from there too it's just all part of

579
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,480
life here and then we get metals from

580
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,559
our food supply we get metals from all

581
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,000
kinds of different things and those

582
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,000
Metals sit inside of our organs they sit

583
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,159
inside of our liver they sit inside of

584
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,279
our brain that's where the metals sit

585
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,840
and then they pocket out they out gas

586
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,559
and eventually they spread now you can

587
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,400
get new metal exposures just say at the

588
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,880
gas pump or breathing in breathing in

589
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,600
fragrances colog perfumes you like the

590
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,919
smell smells so pretty it smells like

591
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,159
beautiful wild flowers in this beautiful

592
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,360
place I love the smell of this perfume

593
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,679
cologne and this air freshener that I

594
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,720
just sprayed on my couch filled with

595
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,240
Metals we breathe it in we smell it

596
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,640
we're smelling metals and they're

597
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,200
entering into our body we can't run from

598
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
it we can't hide it's everywhere right

599
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,640
of course we can pull our air freshener

600
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,039
out of the wall and toss it of course we

601
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
can pull something out of the wall and

602
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,600
toss it like that we can throw

603
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,279
detergents out and bring in you know

604
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,640
fragrance-free detergents in hopes that

605
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:05,320
we're actually bypassing a lot of them

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,880
we can do a lot of things we can avoid

607
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,840
fluoride at the

608
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,000
dentist we can avoid which is a

609
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,120
neurotoxin byproduct of aluminum we

610
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,640
could avoid that we can do some things

611
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,919
but either way we've had fluoride

612
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,960
treatments in the past maybe when you

613
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:25,600
were younger either way those Metals

614
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,600
build up and they out poock and then

615
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,880
Metals meet the road they meet the

616
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,480
pavement right here the metals meet the

617
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,039
virus see this Metals meet the virus now

618
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,039
here's what happens with viruses and

619
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,919
here's what goes on with viruses okay

620
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:44,919
Metals meet the

621
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,640
virus viruses are on the same frequency

622
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,960
as toxic heavy

623
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,200
metals same

624
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,640
frequency they're not

625
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,600
opposites okay pathogens like viruses

626
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:07,399
are on the same frequency as toxic heavy

627
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,960
metals they morph together is what they

628
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:13,399
do they bond so that's what they do they

629
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,679
bond and that's important to know the

630
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:21,559
metals Bond there's a b o n

631
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:26,240
d hope that's how you spell it Metals

632
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:29,960
bond together with pathogens they make a

633
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,200
connection So eventually pathogen gets

634
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,880
hungry it's looking for food and then it

635
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,200
finds it it starts to Feast on the toxic

636
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,840
heavy metal because we're all loaded

637
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,200
with Metals but how loaded are you how

638
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,720
loaded I get Metals in me every

639
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,080
day if I get Metals in me every day you

640
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,640
get Metals in you every day if I walk

641
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
outside and I'm breathing in a Sea Trail

642
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,919
and I'm getting Metals in how much crap

643
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,640
they're dumping on the out of the sky on

644
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,399
us every single day right now and then

645
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,640
you got you got regular crap being

646
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,840
dumped on us just just that alone from

647
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,360
all the all the fuel that's coming off

648
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,279
of planes I'm not even talking about sea

649
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,760
Trails just the fuel alone right so you

650
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:09,240
walk outside I'm walking outside I'm

651
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,760
breathing in toxic heavy metals you're

652
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,440
breathing in toxic heavy metals are you

653
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,159
in town are you breathing in that stuff

654
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,360

like whoa what is that I'm breathing in

658
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,600
metals you're breathing in metals that's

659
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,080
right but how many metals do you have do

660
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,039

is metals are

675
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,360
involved metals and the metals are

676
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,399
meeting the pavement baby the pavement

677
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,320
is the pathogen right they're meeting

678
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,159
the road they're meeting together

679
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,360
they're running into each other is

680
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,000
what's happening pathogens and metals

681
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,080
are running into each other so you got

682
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,440
Boom the pathogen sorry the metals Boom

683
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,480
the pathogen and they're doing this

684
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,480
they're meeting and when they're meeting

685
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,960
the pathogen is feasting so let's go

686
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,240

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,159
uses Mercury to preserve pathogens and

806
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,559
keep them alive by feeding the pathogen

807
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,840
while it's sitting there in the in the

808
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:18,480

either way but they're not sick yet but

873
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,440

885
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,040

combination the five key ingredients

899
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,040
that's what matters that's the heavy

900
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,079
metal detox and that's what we're

901
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,640
talking about okay pathogens and toxins

902
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:46,680
so we have we have pathogens we have the

903
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,359
bugs we have the metals and right there

904
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,079
it's that combination so what does the

905
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,240
pathogen do what does the virus do the

906
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,079
virus clings onto the metal the metal

907
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:00,720
clings onto the virus the metal sits on

908
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,920
the virus virus like this so the metal

909
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,640
sits on the

910
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:10,400
virus particles of the oxidation sit on

911
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,680
the virus just like this okay and then

912
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,160
the virus dissolves the particles

913
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:19,839
dissolves it absorbs it through the

914
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:22,079
membrane and feeds on it once a virus

915
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,720
has Metals in it and it's been feeding

916
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,319
on those metals and it's

917
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,240
absorbing those metals and bringing them

918
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:31,319
into into the virus you see this right

919
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,280
here the metals are clinging onto the

920
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,599
viral

921
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,920
wall a cell wall and they're being

922
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,119
absorbed right into the virus you see

923
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,839
that you guys once that

924
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:47,160
happens the virus gets fueled it gets

925
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:49,680
strength it awakens when it awakens it

926
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,280
becomes a beast depending on what kind

927
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,200
of virus you have it becomes a beast so

928
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,520
once those get in there the metals go in

929
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,800
it now the virus is awake and it's Fe

930
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,720
feeding once it's feeding it has to go

931
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,520
to the bathroom it has to go to the

932
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,359
bathroom it has to eliminate the virus

933
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,400
has to eliminate toxins now the more

934
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,160
fuel the virus gets which is the metals

935
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,200
the more fuel the virus gets which is

936
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,319
all those Metals the more bathroom is

937
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,359
produced the more

938
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:27,960
elimination is produced and when that

939
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:29,560
elimination leaves the virus now that

940
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,440
mercury that aluminum especially that

941
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,960
mercury aluminum the copper right the

942
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,200
lead the cadmium the

943
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,119
Arsenic right once that metal

944
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,720
leaves in a different form out of the

945
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:48,200
virus here it goes now those are

946
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,240
neurotoxins neurotoxic waste coming out

947
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,720
of those viruses epine bar herplex one

948
00:38:51,240 --> 00:39:00,319
herp Simplex 2 cytomegalo virus shingles

949
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,920
herpes hhv6 hhv7 this is all particles

950
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:04,960
being excreted from the virus now you

951
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,280
see this stuff right here it's coming

952
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,119
out and when that comes out it's going

953
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,119
into your bloodstream now now you're

954
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,160
getting aches and pains tingles and

955
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,280
numbness now you're getting vertigo now

956
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,839
you're getting more ttis now you're

957
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,520
getting more problems here it is the

958
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,280
elimination is

959
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,599
neurotoxins being eliminated from the

960
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:28,480
pathogen because the pathogen fed off of

961
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:32,119
the metals so what you have here now

962
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,760
is toxic waste coming from the pathogen

963
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:38,599
the virus that toxic waste is now

964
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,319
trouble what that toxic waste

965
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:44,359
is okay that's your headache that's your

966
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:46,040
tingles and numbness that's your ex and

967
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,400
pains if it's been ruled out that they

968
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,680
don't know why you have any of that at

969
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,839
the doctor's office if they find an

970
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,839
answer it's obvious but if you're

971
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,000
somebody that like really doesn't know

972
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,000
no one really has an answer mystery

973
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
chronic illness for many years

974
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,720
you're dealing with the metals and the

975
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,640
viruses the metals and the

976
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,880
viruses and those viruses are leeching

977
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,280
out all of that now it's spewing out all

978
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,240
that neurotoxin when that neurotoxin

979
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,280
comes out goes into your bloodstream and

980
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,040
guess where it ends up it ends up in

981
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,760
here that's right it ends up in your

982
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,000
liver guess where else it ends up as

983
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,319
brain fog in your brain it ends up in

984
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,520
your brain as brain fog start getting

985
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,680
getting symptoms why do I have brain fog

986
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,560
how come I'm losing my memory how come I

987
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,760
actually can't think anymore how come

988
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm like so fogged out that's the

989
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,680
neurotoxins leaving the pathogens the

990
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,640
viruses after the pathogens just

991
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,560
absorbed literally absorbed heavy metal

992
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,040
runoff in heavy metal particles right

993
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,000
here from all of this metal outgassing

994
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,240
and oxidizing you see it all all of that

995
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,040
and then the pathogen fed off of that

996
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,319
and it's releasing all those neurotoxins

997
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,640
those neurotoxins end up in the

998
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:04,319
bloodstream and here we go in your

999
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,720
bloodstream there it is right there in

1000
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,040
your organs in your bloodstream all of

1001
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:14,319
that neurotoxin and you're sick you got

1002
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,119
me cff you got chronic fatigue syndrome

1003
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,160
you got all kinds of different

1004
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,960
conditions you got pots right you got

1005
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,640
just so many different conditions that

1006
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,520
you can have ra and so forth and that's

1007
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,680
how it works okay all right

1008
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,880
see uh Mela over there on IG these

1009
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,800
changes have changed my life I was so

00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,000
okay the heavy metal detox the medical

1027
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,800
medium heavy metal

1028
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,400
detox it's been life-saving for so many

1029
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,200
people for so many years there was

1030
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,800
nothing out there when that was out

1031
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,400
there saving lives there was nothing out

1032
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,839
there the whole term heavy metal detox

1033
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,280
now is because of the medical medium

1034
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,800
information out there all these years

1035
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,240
putting heavy metals on the map and

1036
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,160
heavy metal detox on the map five key

1037
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,480
ingredients is the heavy metal detox you

1038
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,559
you can essentially have those in

1039
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,520
anything you want you can have those in

1040
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,800
a salad you can have those in some other

1041
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,599
in a smoothie Bowl you can have those

1042
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,520
five key ingredients in some other form

1043
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,599
or some other way throughout the course

1044
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,079
of the

1045
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,960
day but you got to have those five key

1046
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,760
ingredients I like them any way possible

1047
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,400
okay but Awan medical medium

1048
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,119
collaboration June 15th they're putting

1049
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,680
the heavy metal detox smoothie on the

1050
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,240
menu there which is insane

1051
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,359
I'm so excited about it in all 10 of

1052
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,880
their stores how incredible any proceeds

1053
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,520
that go to me go directly to charity

1054
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,359
back to the medical medum community all

1055
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,400
right and you have to understand

1056
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,480
something kation was dangerous years ago

1057
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,319
the one thing about Spirit of compassion

1058
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,000
about putting the heavy metal detox the

1059
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:51,520
five key ingredients to get Metals out

1060
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,559
of us so we can heal and move forward is

1061
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,800
because there were dangerous cation

1062
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,559
techniques and the information wasn't

1063
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,280
because they knew Metals caused any

1064
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:02,400
conditions they didn't think Metals

1065
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,440
caused conditions they didn't think they

1066
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,040
caused this or this or psoriasis or

1067
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,640
eczema or anything like that this

1068
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,960
medical medium information but they use

1069
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,400
cation for like when you drank lead

1070
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,839
water you know like lead water like

1071
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,359
you're you're drinking tap water and

1072
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,680
then the city declared an emergency and

1073
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,839
that tap water was loaded with lead and

1074
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,359
then what they would do is they would

1075
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,559
try to do kelation on the person and it

1076
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,960
was like that's all they had but I'm

1077
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:30,520
talking about mystery chronic illness

1078
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,400
and people suffering and struggling and

1079
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,119
heavy metals that whole thing people

1080
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,480
didn't know anything about that they

1081
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:38,000
just didn't and spirit of compassion put

1082
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
the heavy metal detox out there all

1083
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,200
these years saved so many lives it's an

1084
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,839
incredible incredible thing so I'm just

1085
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,079
