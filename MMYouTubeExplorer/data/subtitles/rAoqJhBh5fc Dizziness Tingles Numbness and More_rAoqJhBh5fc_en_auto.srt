the thing is is what people don't

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,120
what they don't get is that when you

start getting neurological symptoms

162
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,000
when you start getting the aches and

163
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479

164
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,759

down and you feel weakness in the limbs

170
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,039

all through your body and you know what

177
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,759
i find is that people don't get it

178
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
unless they've been in your shoes

179
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
they don't understand unless they've

180
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
been there with you you know and it's

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,160
hard

182
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
for a lot of people who don't know what

183
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
this feels like they don't know about

184
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,000
the tightness in the chest and

185
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
the panic attacks and your arms go numb

186
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,880
and your

187
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
pinkies start to hurt and you get the

188
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080

189
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,080

357
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,440
in their shoes because you feel it and

how do i start getting rid of some of

511
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,000
these symptoms how do i start

512
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,120
getting some of these symptoms to back

513
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,199
down and here's here's an important part

514
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,639
knowing what's causing these symptoms

515
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
and the trigger so i want to go into

516
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
that if you guys got a minute i want to

517
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,440
cover triggers

518
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
very important it's a lot of different

519
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
triggers out there i talk about the

520
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
trigger

521
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,759
foods foods that trigger

522
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,639
these symptoms more and more so i talk

523
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
about that

524
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
so i talk about foods triggering these

525
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,800
symptoms

526
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,880
i talk about different things also like

527
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
chemicals and pesticides and herbicides

528
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,040
they can trigger these symptoms

529
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,959
i talk about a lot of things that can

530
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,839
and that's important also emotional

531
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
hardships

532
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,240
i talk about betrayal and broken trust

533
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
and different struggles emotionally and

534
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,439
how that can trigger

535
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,199
our neurological symptoms a little bit

536
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
but it's not the cause but it can

537
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,640
definitely

538
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,000
trigger mold that's one right there so

539
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
mold can actually

540
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,079
trigger the the nervous system it can

541
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
trigger the nervous system because it

542
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,520
weakens the immune system so really

543
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
really intense mold problems can trigger

544
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,480
the immune system by

545
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
weakening it and then the neurological

546
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,760
symptoms could get worse i talk about

547
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
all these things but that's just some

548
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,679
stuff

549
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,320
i describe the symptoms all of that

550
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,160
tonya says where do i find this episode
