I healed my migraines and varicosa veins

133
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,280
you know the varicose veins thing is a

134
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,520
big deal I hear that a lot with the

135
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,639
cleansing the heel book and the

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,120
different cleanses in there I hear that

137
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:10,039
a lot with the 369 where varicose veins

138
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,840
back down they heal they start going

139
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:14,680
away spider veins back down and start

140
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,120
going away that's a big deal for a lot

141
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,199
of people like spider veins that that

142
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,319
that really bothers a lot of people

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,440
spider veins get like they get out of

144
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,599
control and they're all over the ankles

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,319
and they're all over the calf and

146
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,120
they're all over the shin and they're

147
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:30,759
all over the knee and the spider veins

148
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,599
or everything everywhere they show up

149
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:38,560
like spiders you know on somebody's

150
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:40,759
body to get rid of that without surgery

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,919
to get rid of varicose veins without

152
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,199
surgery I mean there's people that go

153
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,120
and they're just getting their their

154
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,520
legs cut open and they're doing you know

155
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,039
and then or they're doing electronic

156
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,199
surgeries where all this where that

157
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,759
whole thing is brutal and then all of a

158
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,440
sudden they all come back it's important

159
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,319
that we get toxins out of us it's

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
important that we cleanse the poison out

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,319
so that we can do some healing this

162
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,199
matters it really does getting your life

have what it takes sense over there 369

167
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,560
took away a lot of the patterns which

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,400
were so so

169
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,759
toxic duly noted duly noted that's a big

170
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,319
deal that's a really big deal deal this

171
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:36,800
matters to me okay this is why I do what

172
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,800
I do wake up in the morning I do it over

173
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
again I don't care I'll push through

174
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll fight for it I don't care about the

175
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,360
hassles and the hate or the jealousy

176
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,000
that's out there the sabotage or

177
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,960
whatever because nobody no the world

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,840

still got all those too but you're sick

312
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,760
and you're struggling if someone's sick

313
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
with chronic illness they have all that

314
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,399
plus

315
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,399
that you know I got a friend and my

316
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,440
friend was complaining and complaining

317
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,600
complaining about a bunch of things and

318
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
I'm like dude whatever you're

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,480
complaining about can you imagine if you

320
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
were sick with chronic illness and all

321
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,720
that because that's that's that's the

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,160
hard part right there is living with a

323
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,680
symptom or a condition and dealing with

324
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,639
all the stuff that everybody has to deal

325
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,959
with in life it's the combination of

326
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,800
both think about that that's really hard

327
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,120
for a lot of people a lot of people so

328
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,160

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,199
369 number one the only cleanse out

330
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,920

they just don't they don't meaning all

341
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,079
the makers and pushers of this stuff

342
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,800
they have no idea probably anyway but

343
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,040
even if they did have an idea I don't

344
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,000
think most of them would care just do my

345
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,880
cleanse just do my

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,360
cleanse and what happens is that these

347
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,800
cleanses here from above were designed

348
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,720
so your adrenals are saved but nobody

349
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,720

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,040
is the only cleanses that protect your

364
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,160
adrenals while you're

365
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,320
cleansing there's so much adrenal

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,880
information in the books I almost think

367
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,399
the books are just all adrenal

368
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,240
information

369
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,120
sometimes like

370
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:18,680
seriously like that's how much adrenal

371
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:22,199
information is in the books it's

372
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,560
insane so yeah what people don't realize

373
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,839
out there is with cleanses you drink a

374
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,759
whole B here's this is ridiculous if you

375
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,079
hear this if you hear about a cleanse

376
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,399
where you drink a whole bunch of olive

377
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,519
oil in the morning or something like

378
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,240
that run run

379
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,240
screaming run

380
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,680
screaming

381
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,519
seriously what a way to get yourself

382
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,360
sick wake up in the morning be like ah

383
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,199
I'm going to try to do this biohack

384
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,120
right here and maybe try to cleanse or

385
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,440
something I'm going to drink a glass of

386
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,480
olive oil and send it on down Run Run

387
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,480
for the hills man run for the from the

388
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,560
hills okay great way to mess up your

389
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,000
adrenals great way to screw up your

390
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,440
liver just great

391
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,319
way yeah yeah May they're

392
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,399
new yeah

393
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:14,319
so the whole point here is what I'm

394
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,040
trying to get at is these cleanses

395
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,040
actually protect and help even heal your

396
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,839
adrenals protect and even help heal your

397
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,519
adrenals so much

398
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
so when you actually restore your

399
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,680
adrenals after you're getting rid of all

400
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,199
the toxins and you're cleansing and

401
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,040
you're cleaning everything up and you

402
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,360
restore your

403
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,440
adrenals look

404
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
out because then if you go and you

405
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,079
change your

406
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,720
diet and you actually start bringing in

407
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,680
stuff you haven't eaten a long time

408
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,720
you're going to feel like a burst and

409
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,160
what that burst is your adrenals then

410
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,120
going explode explode

411
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,440
explode yeah well I've been doing

412
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,000
medical medium I got my symptoms down

413
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,279
I've been healing I've been doing mm and

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,839
what does that mean anyway we got to

415
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,399
talk about that a little bit too like

416
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
what do you mean you're doing mm like

417
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,880
seriously have you been just doing hmds

418
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,799
that would be amazing if you you're just

419
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
doing the celery juice are you doing a

420
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,000
monoc cleanse for a long time are you

421
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,679
doing all the supplement Protocols are

422
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
you picking and customizing your own

423
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,439
supplement protocol like what is it

424
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,679
you're doing there people every day out

425
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
there I hear it there I do medical

426
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,640
medium and then you all of a sudden see

427
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,160
they're posting something later on or

428
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,079
something and they're posting all this

429
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
other stuff it's terrible it's not even

430
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,799

431
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,960
for saying you do M but you're doing a

432
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,600
bunch of other stuff and it's not

433
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,440
working for you

434
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,799
but what happens is when people really

435
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:43,240
do medical medium they do right really

436
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,760
do it they're they they understand stay

437
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,799
away from the natural flavor stay away

438
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,640
from the canola oil okay keep the fats

439
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,039
low right do the cleanses periodically

440
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,039
if you want do a straight 369 you could

441
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,400
do it for life but do do it right and

442
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,360
they doing it what happens is is you

443
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,159
start cleaning up you start healing your

444
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,720
symptoms you start recovering you start

445
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,080
rebuilding yeah you start rebuilding and

446
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,799
recovering but then you're kind of like

447
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,799
on an even

448
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Keel and then you get off and you eat

449
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,280
big old greasy pizza with pepperoni on

450
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,200

451
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,240

464
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,840
for a while his medical mum information

465
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,799
is not about being anti-red meat you can

466
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,919
do the information do the protocols do

467
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,360
some healing do the hmds and still do

468
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,640
meat it's about making sure you do all

469
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,919
the right things and you're doing all

470
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,960
you know looking out but if you're doing

471
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,760
the cleanse and you're doing one of

472
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,200
these powerful cleanses like the 369 and

473
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,679
then you come off that cleanse and you

474
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,440
start eating red meat you're going to

475
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,080
get a burst you're going to be like oh

476
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,120
my God because what happened was during

477
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
the 369 you're restoring your adrenals

478
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,679
and they're getting stronger and

479
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,679
stronger and stronger and they're

480
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,600
healing you're bringing your adrenals

481
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,679
back and they're getting stronger

482
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,080
stronger and they're healing that's

483
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,080
what's happening and as your adrenals

484
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,280
are healing all you got to do is shove

485
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,360

beef red beef shove down some

487
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
chicken and then your adrenals are going

488
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,000
to go meaning they're going to release a

489
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,760
lot of

490
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,679

I get it a lot of people want that they

607
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,039

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,600
information from above the

613
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,600
369 right

614
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,880
there it isn't just more toxins than

615
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,880
ever before and I'm going to tell you

616
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,840
right now we used to worry about the

617
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,840
oceans the oceans are toxic the oceans

618
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,840
are toxic the oceans are toxic look out

619
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,000
look out they're toxic they're getting

620
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,799
more toxic there's mercury in the oceans

621
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,159
there's all kinds of you know dioxins

622
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,760
dioxins they all you know in the ocean

623
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:32,399
right glysophates in the ocean

624
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,120
everything's in the ocean it's all in

625
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,240
there pesticides in the ocean all these

626
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,279
things in the ocean

627
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,919
right human bodies are dirtier than the

628
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,600
oceans

629
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:48,840
now human bodies surface Sur surfing on

630
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:53,760
the big waves are dirtier than the big

631
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:57,240
waves yeah that's right that's right I

632
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,200
don't know about you guys but for me

633
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,760
when I think about that I'm like when I

634
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,640
think about that

635
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:09,240
seriously okay people swimming in the

636
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,000
ocean are more toxic than the

637
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,720
ocean yeah that's right they

638
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,600
are people swimming in the ocean and

639
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,880
their armpits sweating while they're

640
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,559
swimming they're out gassing with

641
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,880
flatulence in the

642
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,279
ocean their feet all kinds of fungus all

643
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,039
kinds of yeast around their toes there's

644
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,799
swimming in the

645
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:36,200
ocean like feet collect all kinds of

646
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:39,880
crap I

647
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,360
mean like the the whole thing with feet

648
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,320
right and the feet fetishes out there

649
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,799

657
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,320
there you know anyway them swimming in

658
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,559
the ocean people are more toxic than the

659
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,320
ocean now it used to be the other way

660
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,159
around where the oceans were just more

661
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,080
toxic they were more toxic they just

662
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:25,760
were Metals dioxins Mercury algae algae

663
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,720
blooms but people believe it or not are

664
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,360
even more toxic their livers are filled

665
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:34,120
with more garbage more junk more crap

666
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,760
their livers are really really toxic

667
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,440
that's the world we live in now people

668
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:44,480
are highly toxic and the irony is so

669
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,120
many of the biohacks are making them

670
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,600
more toxic which is

671
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,919
crazy crazy Pearl powder great way great

672
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,320
way to tear up the intestinal track also

673
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,799
add toxins it's like you know people

674
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
don't even realize that's just one thing

675
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,919
and everything else and what about the

676
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,880
protein craze here's what happens the

677
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,279
protein the protein

678
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,919
demon the protein

679
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,159
demon is literally going

680
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,919
to

681
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,720
destroy destroy the brains of so many

682
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,799
people so they never heal so they never

683
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,559
heal yeah there's a new upcoming wave of

684
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,600
sick young people and they're being

685
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:32,000
conditioned on the protein scam

686
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,279
conditioned on the protein scam all you

687
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,080
see on social is protein protein protein

688
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,159
proteins everything that's all it's all

689
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,399
you see on social is people screaming

690
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,039
about protein it is by far one of the

691
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,600
stupidest things I've ever seen hands

692
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:49,240
down one of those and I would actually

693
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,440
be one of those people too if I didn't

694
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,120
know if I didn't have Spirit of

695
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,039
compassion I would easily be if I was

696
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,200
into health I wasn't into Health when I

697
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:00,000
was when I was a kid Spirit of

698
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,440
compassion made me and made me be into

699
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,360
health I wouldn't be into it I

700
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,360
wouldn't no way no way no way even

701
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,240
though these are the most unbelievable

702
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,200
medical Bibles out there in the world

703
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,679
that have turned people's lives around

704
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,320
it wouldn't have been what I wanted to

705
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,559
do I was you know pushed into it forced

706
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,799
into it by Spirit of compassion but the

707
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:25,600
protein thing I would be a sucker for

708
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,080
that one too easily easily I'd be like

709
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,480

protein demon it is insane to the degree

722
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,200

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,440
the right things I eat a couple healthy

735
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,480
things they're worried about protein you

736
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,240
look at their feed three months later go

737
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,440
in their feed back a year ago they were

738
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,559
crazed about protein the whole point is

739
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,120
everybody is it is literally literally

740
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:36,039

ridiculous stupidity the protein

743
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,720
problem everybody gets enough protein

744
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,559
everybody's been getting enough protein

745
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,880
unless unless you live somewhere and

746
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,600
you're like poor and you're eating

747
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:57,639
dirt and you're you're just like digging

748
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,399
and looking for a worm which is high in

749
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,639
prote

750
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:05,320
unless you're

751
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:07,399
like like all you have is white rice

752
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,200
that's not brown rice it's just white

753
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:12,000
rice it's been processed just totally

754
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,039
processed unless you're living somewhere

755
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,960
and you're in a hut somewhere and you're

756
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,000
only you've only been given just white

757
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,159
rice meaning the center of the the

758
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,080
center of the grain stripped stripped of

759
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,480
anything right bleached and stripped and

760
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,360
that's the only thing you've been given

761
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,320
I I mean you might get you might get

762
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,519
protein deficient over time you

763
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,000
might nobody's protein deficient nobody

764
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,320
has protein

765
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,080
deficiencies nobody

766
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,159
does you don't unless you're being starv

767
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,799
to death and what you're being starved

768
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:53,080
on doesn't

769
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,159
have even one amino

770
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,480
acid nobody nobody's deficient of

771
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,679
protein but you'll see people are sick

772
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,480
sick and dying people are dying and

773
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:07,080
they're on tons of

774
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,919
protein I know there's a there's a guy

775
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,639
on social that's been screaming about

776
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,159
things like protein and everything else

777
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,039
and protein and all this stuff and the

778
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,240
guy's blood letting himself because he

779
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,480
has he has a condition and he's blood

780
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,320
letting himself because he has a

781
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,559
condition so he's bloodletting himself

782
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,399
the protein didn't fix him the protein

783
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,679
didn't fix the guy

784
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,720
the is literally blood letting himself

785
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,600
and his protein protein and everything

786
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,840
else about protein wasn't the answer for

787
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,799
the guy the guy's in the health scene

788
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,559
and he's bloodletting himself he's

789
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,639
teaching people how to bloodlet real

790
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:46,320
smart real smart the point I'm trying to

791
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,559
say is how come the protein didn't fix

792
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,559
you

793
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,200
man Josh I gained over 50 pounds of

794
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,159
muscle on lowfat low protein plant-based

795
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,679
medical medium um thank you for saying

796
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:00,960
medical medium because there's

797
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:03,399
plant-based but it's

798
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,799
different there's plant-based and it's

799
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:09,639
different okay you can be like doing

800
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,360
like what you call keto or something and

801
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:14,000
but you could be doing medical medium

802
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,399
style so you can heal and say you know

803
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,720
it's good to have the medical medium

804
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,960
there when it applies when it applies

805
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,880
Fazio over there on YouTube I survive

806

information I mean I remember was it 4

years ago or something like that people

813
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,279
screaming that I wasn't spiritual or

814
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,039
something like that oh no I I only hear

815
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,760
a voice The Voice put talks about the

816
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,360
soul in the books um the voice talks

817
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,840
about the golden rope I mean I don't

818
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,240
know what to say as a messenger I'm just

819

doing the best I can but remember there

820
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,039
was like there was like a moment in time

821
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,760
where people like he's not spiritual

822
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:03,120
he's not

823
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,679
spiritual and and I was scratching my

824
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,200
head saying the spirit of compassion

825
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:10,560
like did we do something wrong because I

826
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,879
don't know I I thought I put spiritual

827
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,879
information in the books that you told

828
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,359
me

829
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,159
about Erica you're laughing out loud

830
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,760
laugh out loud out loud

831
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,599
so the protein thing is insane watch it

832
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,879
grow it's going to grow into a massive

833
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,480
monster conditioning people and and it's

834
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,399
going to be the Takeover it's the next

835
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,359
takeover it's protein you're going to

836
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,599
see 10 more stupid drinks you know out

837
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,159
there on ad running ads about proteins

838
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:39,879
in it you're going to see more protein

839
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,919
talk than ever before you're just going

840
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,320
to see and hear about protein left and

841
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,520
right you know CLA says you're the most

842
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,200
spiritual I'm honored and you know and

843
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,200
in spirit of

844
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,839
compassion the the amount of protein

845
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,079
talk that you guys are going to be up

846
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:58,760
against pretty soon it's going to be

847
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,920
unbelievable but everybody gets protein

848
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:08,079
you eat one bean you eat you eat hummus

849
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,720
you eat an ounce sure an ounce of

850
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,520
steak whatever it's everywhere you eat a

851
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:18,160
nut you eat a leaf of spinach you want

852
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,040
protein protein that's actually

853
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,280
assimilable you want protein that

854
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,160
actually absorbs do the medical medium

855
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,880
spinach soup because it's it's the

856
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,680
protein that actually goes into into to

857
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,680
the body and gets utilized and broken

858
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:37,320
down what about spirulina what about

859
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,480
spirulina spirulina is is is one of the

860
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,760
most

861
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,599
bioavailable protein

862
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,440
sources most bioavailable protein Source

863
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,280
barleygrass juice powder is one of the

864
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,079
most bioavailable protein sources you

865
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,680
know why I don't scream about protein

866
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:56,119
medical medium information you get

867
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,680
plenty of protein you get the best

868
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,520
proteins you get the best best proteins

869
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,599
I'm sorry but you do medical medium

870
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,640
information you get the best

871
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:07,920
proteins I mean I if I'm annoying

872
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,520
anybody just you know you could say so I

873
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,119
don't know what to say but it's true you

874
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,839
get the most bioavailable protein from

875
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:18,560
the sparina the barley grass cheese but

876
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,359
are you kidding that's just two things

877
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,960
the spinach soup all the leafy greens

878
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,359
nobody talked about leafy greens medical

879
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,640
medium

880
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,119
information I mean I'm just saying

881
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,160
medical medium information didn't create

882
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,119
and grow a leafy green leafy greens

883
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,100
aren't here because of me no because of

884
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,319
the spirit of compassion no they're

885
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,680
[Music]

886
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:44,520
not God's seeds you know God seed seeded

887
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,119
the planet the leafy greens

888
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,880
okay but people were eating like the

889
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,560
hygienic movement was eating just

890
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:57,599
iceberg lettuce it was eating iceberg

891
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,599
lettuce right iceberg lettuce

892
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,920
and now they're attacking leafy greens

893
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,800
this is the hilarious part right here we

894
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,400
need leafy greens we need leafy herb

895
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,200
greens like parsley and

896
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,440
cilantro and now they're attacking

897
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,680
it it's like that one idiot that keeps

898
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,680
on running ads 24/7 to the medical

899
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,640
medium Community him and his

900
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,000

cilantro they keep on talking bad about

904
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:31,319
spir Lina they didn't even know what

905
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,720
spirina was years

906
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,280
ago they were probably like balloon

907
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
sales people or something like that

908
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,880

964
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:06,680
people that's how it works God creates

965
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:10,319
people right that create chemical

00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,160
factories to kill people

967
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:16,839
right God creates the ability for us

968
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,440
to manufacture machines and make

969
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,400
machines and poison the oceans but God

970
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,359
also puts things out there to recover

971
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,319
people to get their lives back like

972
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,520
parsley and

973
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,880
cilantro and leafy

974
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,680

sparina things that actually can bring

977
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:46,000
us back and that's the miracle that's

978
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,839
the miracle we got to pick and choose

979
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,800
the things that actually work you know

981
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
actually

982
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,480

00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:35,720
don't have enough of that there enough

1095
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,319
glucose because when you do a milk

1096
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:40,160
cleanse you you got fat in there the

1097
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,280
glucose doesn't get to the

1098
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,559
brain it just doesn't the fat blocks it

1099
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,359
just doesn't get to the brain so when

1100
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:51,119
you try to do a milk cleanse the fat

1101
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:53,839
blocks it see how it works that's how it

1102
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,119
works you can't let the glucose be

1103
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,599
blocked so the medical medium cleanses a

1104
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,480
369 cleanse doesn't stop the glucose

1105
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,160
from getting to the brain if you're

1106
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,599
going to cleanse you need sugar you need

1107
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,480
glucose to do the cleanse critical you

1108
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:12,520
don't need table sugar you don't need

1109
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,319
gobs and gobs of table sugar that that's

1110
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,319
nothing to do with

1111
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,440
it I love that love the whole carnivore

1112
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,240
thing now it's just like I

1113
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,280
predicted I mean you want to know

1114
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,240
prophecy you see this every now every

1115
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,680
now like prophecy this prophecy that out

1116
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,680
there prophecy

1117
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,559
is years ago me me saying that the

1118
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,400
carnivore guys the ones that were all

1119
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:35,079
just meat only meat only meat only and

1120
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,800
then raw meat raw meat and then meat

1121
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,960
cooked meat and cooked meat remember the

1122
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,119
pro what I said I said a bunch of times

1123
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,839
they're going to hit the wall and

1124
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:43,359
they're going to start adding lemon then

1125
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,200
they're going to start adding honey then

1126
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,640
they're going to start adding berries

1127
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,079
now they're just on a keto diet and

1128
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,640
they're calling it carnivore prophecy

1129
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,640
came true came

1130
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,680
true the reason why I'm talking about it

1131
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,400
kills the adrenals you want to do just

1132
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,720
all meat only and only meat you're going

1133
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,960
to kill your adrenals because your

1134
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,559
adrenals have to push adrenaline to your

1135
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,200
system to try to keep your body floating

1136
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,160
through all that fat all that overt

1137
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,680
fat think about it if you're going to be

1138
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:18,280
on meat only you're going to be on a

1139
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,440
high overt fat diet 247 so your adrenals

1140
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:22,240
are just going to suffer they're going

1141
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,880
to suffer Marie you remember Marie you

1142
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,160
remember YouTube you can't believe you

1143
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,240
remember this is years ago what the heck

1144
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,440
Allison I remember you said I remember

1145
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:37,400
you said fat was evil what are we

1146
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,400
saying you know the thing went

1147
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,760
listen

1148
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:45,720
so the prophecy was they'd all be kind

1149
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,720
of hit in the wall five years later four

1150
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,440
years later they all are and then you'll

1151
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,880
get a new person starting up right a

1152
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,680
brand new person some trainer or

1153
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,520
something like that I'm on Carnivore I'm

1154
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,520
going to try it I'm on all meat great

1155
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,680
you take your crowd down there you take

1156
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,440
your crowd down to hell with

1157
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:06,680
you you take them down and whoever

1158
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,000
survives six months later and a year

1159
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,760
later because you know what's going to

1160
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,480
happen you might break your carnivore

1161
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,680
diet for in a month later but you're not

1162
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,880
going to tell your crowd you're going to

1163
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,640
keep that a secret but you're going to

1164
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,960
have people in your crowd that won't

1165
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,079
they won't lie and they won't break it

1166
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,200
and there's going to be people in your

1167
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,559
crowd that are going to do it and

1168
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,599
they're going to be hitting the walls

1169
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:23,920
and those are the people that turn

1170
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,000
around and say I did carnivore and

1171
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,680
almost killed me because they did

1172
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,079
carnivore the way the other person was

1173
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:35,480
saying they were doing it but they

1174
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,480
weren't that happens all the time you

1175
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:40,640
know lra says 144 do you have more

1176
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,599
prophecies yes lots of them I also know

1177
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,359
why they're doing you know the whole I'm

1178
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:47,319
actually the only one unfortunately that

1179
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:49,640
knows why they're doing the uh the Drone

1180
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:50,920
thing but I don't want to say it because

1181
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,520
when you're the only one that knows what

1182
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,359
they're really doing but no one else is

1183
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,119
talking about it expect people with

1184
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:59,280
black suits coming to your door and I

1185
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,400
don't think it's going to help any of

1186
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,359
us anyway Ross Adams says how are they

1187
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,680
losing weight on

1188
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,480
Carnivore they lose weight on Carnivore

1189
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,960
okay all right because they they mono

1190
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,520
they're mono eating and they left

1191
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,680
whatever they were doing like they were

1192
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,520

and work out more and then all of a

1244
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
sudden they start getting tired in the

1245
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,200
brain because they got no glucose

1246
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,720
anymore Trace mineral salts are gone

1247
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,200
glucose is gone and now they got to

1248
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,319
change their carnivore diet and they got

1249
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,040
to they got a break and they break on

1250
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:18,640
the honey that's why the carnivore diet

1251
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,839
isn't the carnivore diet anymore

1252
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,680
everybody just keeps the name carnivore

1253
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,559
it that should be outlawed if it's not

1254
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,240
the carnivore diet anymore why is it

1255
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,440
still called carnivore somebody should

1256
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,640
say

1257
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,040
something it's not carnivore diet

1258
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,520
anymore when you add honey and now

1259
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,040
Honey's in it the carnivore diet was

1260
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,079
meat only but okay let's keep the name

1261
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,520
carnivore and then add honey now they're

1262
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,119
adding honey because it's the only way

1263
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,599
they can keep their brain working so

1264
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,520
they don't bump into the wall it's the

1265
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,960
only way they can keep their their head

1266
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,280
space working function after a year a

1267
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,920

1269
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,040
when you hit the wall because you got no

questioning myself because

1433
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,559
there's a reason why I don't release the

1434
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,559
spiritual information that I'm releasing

1435
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:37,280
in this book there's a reason

1436
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:39,079
why it's it changes all it breaks all

1437
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,760
paradigms and so what happens is when

00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:43,960

1439
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,359

00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,559
me like what happens when someone dies

for this Wellness reset

1649
01:07:00,279 --> 01:07:03,839
cleans think about

1650
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:08,960
that when somebody's talking crap about

1651
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:12,559
me maybe you can say you know

1652
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,559
what I mean what the

1653
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:20,599
heck the thing is with me is like you

1654
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:22,920
know I got a thick skin but I'm worried

1655
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:25,559
about other people losing their way so

1656
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:28,079
they can't heal it's my always my always

1657
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,880
always concern it's always my concern

1658
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,039
it's people not being able to make their

1659
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,319
way to their healing process cuz they

1660
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:37,160
get thed you know by whatever a li or

1661
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:39,680
misinformation and then they lost their

1662
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,240
chance to heal how crazy is that that

1663
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,200

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,639
right without Spirit of compassion and

1805
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,639
this information you see in front of you

1806
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:36,639
like cleanse to heal and everything else

1807
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:39,320
I I I don't know what would happened I

1808
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,719
got a good idea a really good idea what

1809
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:43,360
would

1810
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:47,800
happened but it

1811
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:50,800
healed I healed it using my free will

1812
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:53,159
listening to Spirit of

1813
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,600
compassion and using Spirit of

1814
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:58,159
compassion's information

1815
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,480
yeah and I remember I me I uttered it a

1816
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,760
little bit it slipped out a little bit

1817
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,560
the other day where I said something

1818
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,040
about it I read a comment I don't know

1819
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,760
if it was on YouTube or Instagram

1820
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,480
something like someone said he's the big

1821
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,320
medical medium he's never supposed to

1822
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,199
have a problem that's very suspicious

1823
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:13,320
that he had to heal a lung problem and

1824
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:15,600
it took a year to do it he must have

1825
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,280
been he I don't know if I trust his

1826
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,280
stuff now are you

1827
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:22,600
kidding it's a good chance I should have

1828
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:24,960
been dead after that years later with

1829
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,440
lung damage like that I healed it you

1830
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,679
using Spirit of compassion's information

1831
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:30,639
it was

1832
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,920
severe totally 100% healed but the point

1833
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:35,600
is and it healed within a

1834
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:38,080
year and yeah I had a doctor friend who

1835
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,800
was like are you on this thing I'm like

1836
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:43,080
yeah I'm doing it he was like people

1837
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:45,000
don't heal from that I'm like yeah I

1838
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:47,480

compassion's

1841
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:56,159
information you know so yeah it works

like for a decade bed bound I lost my

1937
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,760
20s that breaks my heart and so much

1938
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:15,920
excruciating pain daily I just finished

1939
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,120

December we're in January Andrea that's

1943
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,880
mind-blowing mind-blowing okay I'm so

1944
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,320
sorry you were bedbound through your all

1945
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,040
through your 20s and you you know and

1946
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,520
you lost your 20s with sickness like

1947
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,360
that and so happy you're doing the

1948
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:40,800
backbacks that is amazing I'm proud of

1949
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:40,800
you just incredible incredible for

1950
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,679
real I'm choked

1951
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,239
up I think the hardest part the hardest

1952
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:52,719
part is knowing that you guys have

1953
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:54,199
suffered and many of you are still

1954
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:55,840
suffering and you're suffering now and

1955
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:57,320
it's hard and you're just starting your

1956
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,040
you know Journey or your journey needs

1957
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:03,199
to take more time because the problem is

1958
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:06,000
even when you kill off a pathogen you

1959
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:08,440
you know annihilate an epscene bar virus

1960
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,719
right the problem is you can pick up

1961
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,480
another one somehow and then have to go

1962
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,840
back and do it again and clean it up

1963
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:16,320
right another problem just say you

1964
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,360
annihilate your viral issue your

1965
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,159
shingles your epscene bar you annihilate

1966
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:23,760
something and you clean it up right okay

1967
01:21:21,159 --> 01:21:25,920
but the neurotoxins are still left over

1968
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,159
in the liver and take a year or two to

1969
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,159
clean out because neurotoxins from the

1970
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:32,280
virus are toxic just as toxic as the

1971
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,560
virus itself so you're trying to clean

1972
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:36,800
up the neurotoxins and so your nerves

1973
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,400
are still short circuiting right and it

1974
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,080
takes time and now you're two years into

1975
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,440
it three years into it and now you're

1976
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,639
finally healing but you don't know you

1977
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:47,840
might not know to keep on the journey

1978
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:50,000
because you don't know it's hard it's

1979
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,840
hard when you know you have the viral

1980
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,199
stuff you have the Mercury you have the

1981
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,480
neurotoxins you have the metals you have

1982
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:57,320
other things that might have happened in

1983
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:59,480

2032
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,760
emotions that are trapped with

2033
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,639

2038
01:23:53,440 --> 01:24:00,719
trapped trapped in the fat

2163
01:29:32,119 --> 01:29:40,000
spiritual

2164
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:40,000
book so when's and where's and what's

2165
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:45,320
but look a lot of people ask me a lot of

2166
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,199
questions I've seen you guys ask me a

2167
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:49,119
lot of questions over the years I

2168
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:51,080
answered

2169
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:54,080
them I don't know if it's to my

2170
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:56,679
detriment or not but I answered them so

2171
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,880
so when you do get your hands on this

2172
01:29:56,679 --> 01:30:02,520
and you read

2173
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:08,880
it or listen to it or whatever it is

2174
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:08,880
um just take one page at a time

2175
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,159
process all right you

2176
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:19,400
guys oh Jasmine do you wear earplugs to

2177
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,400
not hear

2178
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,639
Spirit I've played a lot of loud music

2179
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:29,880
I've tried the earplug

2180
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:32,760
you know but it got me into some

2181
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,760
situations by wearing

2182
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,760
earplugs

2183
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:42,239
so the problem is if I try to wear ear

2184
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,080
plugs to block out Spirit of compassion

2185
01:30:42,239 --> 01:30:49,159
then I might not hear something I need

2186
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:51,560
to hear Spirit of compassion tell me and

2187
01:30:49,159 --> 01:30:54,040
I've gotten into that jam a couple of

2188
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:57,040
times one that was

2189
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,040
grave

2190
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:02,159
and freaking

2191
01:30:59,239 --> 01:31:04,239
grave yeah yeah and that was from

2192
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,639
plugging my ears and not wanting to hear

2193
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:07,280
Spirit of

2194
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:11,080
compassion

2195
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:14,320
