[50.96 - 56.64] your heavy metal detox how incredible is
[53.08 - 58.80] that Cravings shifter shot why is this
[56.64 - 60.56] important because people in cleanses end
[58.80 - 62.24] up blowing their cleans
[60.56 - 63.36] have you been on a cleanse before do you
[62.24 - 64.92] know what that's like where all of a
[63.36 - 67.16] sudden you can't help it anymore you're
[64.92 - 69.64] like and you start grabbing food and

[75.04 - 80.44] shot indeed spice squash soup squash is
[78.04 - 82.60] healing it's hearty and healing it
[80.44 - 84.36] brings glucose to the brain so that

[84.36 - 89.28] the whole point cleanses hurt the brain
[87.64 - 91.04] out there people do all kinds of
[89.28 - 93.12] cleanses but it's it's not fortifying
[91.04 - 95.36] it's not restoring brain cells it's not
[93.12 - 97.88] restoring gal cells it's not restoring
[95.36 - 100.36] neurons and what you have here is a
[97.88 - 102.92] cleanse that helps do that so you can
[100.36 - 104.72] cleanse and heal and give your body what
