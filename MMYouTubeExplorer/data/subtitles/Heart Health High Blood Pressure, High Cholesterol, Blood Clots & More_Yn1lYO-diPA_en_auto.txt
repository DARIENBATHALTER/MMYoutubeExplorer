[532.96 - 537.92] did butter come in as being healthy
[535.76 - 540.24] that's one thing right there like where
[537.92 - 542.24] did butter come in right
[540.24 - 544.40] so you know where did
[542.24 - 547.20] where did these things kind of come in
[544.40 - 548.48] like eggs like heart healthy stamps on
[547.20 - 550.16] eggs
[548.48 - 552.48] that's a tricky one right there it's
[550.16 - 554.16] like heart-healthy stamps that are on
[552.48 - 556.80] the egg cartons it's like
[554.16 - 558.72] heart healthy heart healthy good for you
[556.80 - 560.88] right and you know so what happens is
[558.72 - 562.80] we're totally in the realm of eating
[560.88 - 564.64] foods to
[562.80 - 567.12] possibly
[564.64 - 568.96] cuddle our condition to get our heart
[567.12 - 570.64] attack down the road well that's what's
[568.96 - 572.32] really you know that's what's really
[570.64 - 574.08] crazy out there how it works so let's go
[572.32 - 576.00] into it of how what happens with the
[574.08 - 578.24] heart how does that work so here's the
[576.00 - 578.24] deal
[579.44 - 583.84] your heart
[581.92 - 585.36] okay
[583.84 - 587.44] right
[585.36 - 588.64] is a muscle machine
[587.44 - 592.64] right
[588.64 - 594.48] its job though is to pump your blood
[592.64 - 597.60] we know that
[594.48 - 600.24] but there's something we don't know
[597.60 - 601.52] it's not supposed to pump
[600.24 - 605.36] blood
[601.52 - 606.80] really high in fat
[605.36 - 610.08] yes
[606.80 - 613.20] it's not supposed to pump blood
[610.08 - 615.20] really high in fat
[613.20 - 618.08] that's what it's not supposed to do
[615.20 - 620.96] because what happens is your liver
[618.08 - 622.48] starts to become a fatty liver because
[620.96 - 623.52] of butter
[622.48 - 624.64] eggs
[623.52 - 626.16] pork
[624.64 - 628.72] all of that and
[626.16 - 630.72] your liver starts to become a fatty
[628.72 - 634.40] liver so here's what happens your
[630.72 - 637.84] heart's job is to pump blood
[634.40 - 640.56] out of your liver
[637.84 - 641.76] your liver is a filter
[640.56 - 643.28] okay
[641.76 - 645.36] i don't know what kind of system you got
[643.28 - 646.40] do you have an air filter system and
[645.36 - 649.68] your
[646.40 - 651.68] hot water heater system your oil burner
[649.68 - 653.52] maybe maybe your apartment building has
[651.68 - 655.60] a big old oil burner down the basement
[653.52 - 659.68] nobody knows about and there's a filter
[655.60 - 662.24] on there and the filter gets dirty
[659.68 - 664.56] your air conditioning has a filter on it
[662.24 - 668.64] there's filters on everything
[664.56 - 671.04] so when the fan is pumping it's sucking
[668.64 - 673.36] air through the filter and as the filter
[671.04 - 676.72] gets clogged you can go and change the
[673.36 - 679.36] filter you can be like you know what
[676.72 - 682.88] i can go change the filter
[679.36 - 685.12] you can't change your liver you can't go
[682.88 - 687.36] you can't change your liver your liver
[685.12 - 689.28] is the filter your liver is the filter
[687.36 - 691.44] you can't go and just say i'm just gonna
[689.28 - 692.96] go change the filter out of my liver i'm
[691.44 - 694.32] just gonna go change the filter out of
[692.96 - 695.60] it of course you're doing medical medium
[694.32 - 696.88] stuff and you're cleaning your liver and
[695.60 - 697.68] you're cleansing all that you can do
[696.88 - 698.96] that
[697.68 - 700.96] but
[698.96 - 702.88] what happens is that filter starts
[700.96 - 704.80] getting clogged up with fat
[702.88 - 707.44] too much dairy
[704.80 - 708.40] milk cheese butter
[707.44 - 709.92] eggs
[708.40 - 712.64] more cheese
[709.92 - 714.24] vegan cheese
[712.64 - 717.84] regular cheese
[714.24 - 719.28] nuts seeds right and it's okay if you
[717.84 - 720.64] want to have a little bit of nuts you
[719.28 - 722.00] want to have a little bit of seeds and
[720.64 - 724.08] nut butters you might have some coconut
[722.00 - 727.44] oil you want some olive oil
[724.08 - 730.56] but it starts to get tired the liver
[727.44 - 733.28] gets tired all the fat starts to bog
[730.56 - 735.36] down the liver and the liver then
[733.28 - 737.28] starts to get tired starts to get
[735.36 - 738.32] clogged
[737.28 - 740.24] and then
[738.32 - 741.60] the heart
[740.24 - 743.20] has to now
[741.60 - 744.80] work harder
[743.20 - 747.36] a hard job
[744.80 - 748.72] is to pump the blood
[747.36 - 751.04] from the liver
[748.72 - 752.80] if your liver is clean and there's not a
[751.04 - 755.36] lot of fat in the liver
[752.80 - 756.88] your blood can pump easy
[755.36 - 759.36] you know easier
[756.88 - 764.16] to the to the heart so the heart's job
[759.36 - 766.08] is to pull the blood from the liver
[764.16 - 768.32] up to it
[766.08 - 768.32] right
[768.64 - 774.00] but then we
[770.48 - 777.04] make our blood so thick
[774.00 - 780.56] like a thick milkshake
[777.04 - 783.28] we turn our blood into a thick milkshake
[780.56 - 784.88] our blood is dehydrated
[783.28 - 787.12] it's thick
[784.88 - 790.00] it becomes congested
[787.12 - 792.88] our blood becomes dirty and i talk about
[790.00 - 794.72] that in the medical medium books right
[792.88 - 797.20] the blood becomes congested or blood
[794.72 - 799.44] becomes dirty blood becomes thick
[797.20 - 800.88] right i talk about that liver rescue
[799.44 - 801.84] cleanse the heel
[800.88 - 804.80] okay
[801.84 - 807.12] and then the heart gets tired
[804.80 - 810.00] years go by
[807.12 - 812.16] and the heart is due it's hearts i don't
[810.00 - 813.84] care if you're exercising that's great
[812.16 - 815.28] you can be working out how many guys are
[813.84 - 817.60] working out they're like i've been
[815.28 - 819.84] working out for 10 years i'm now 45
[817.60 - 822.72] years old and i know my routine and i
[819.84 - 824.24] got my workouts and i could do this
[822.72 - 825.68] but
[824.24 - 827.04] they're just sitting in there on their
[825.68 - 828.72] couch
[827.04 - 830.72] they're sitting on their couch with
[828.72 - 832.72] their family and they're like hey honey
[830.72 - 834.08] can you go can you go answer them can
[832.72 - 836.96] you get my phone
[834.08 - 836.96] oh my god my arm
[837.76 - 840.56] they go down
[839.04 - 842.56] every day
[840.56 - 844.08] people in their 45 people they're 47
[842.56 - 845.60] people they're 50 people who are working
[844.08 - 846.40] out people are riding bikes people are
[845.60 - 848.96] doing
[846.40 - 850.40] cardiovascular work and what happens is
[848.96 - 853.20] that the heart
[850.40 - 854.64] it gets tired as the years go by and the
[853.20 - 855.84] years go by
[854.64 - 858.64] so the heart
[855.84 - 861.92] it has this limitation on it it's not
[858.64 - 864.64] just clogged arteries and clogged veins
[861.92 - 867.36] and clogged valves
[864.64 - 869.12] it's not just clogged ventricles
[867.36 - 871.04] it's not just clogged ventricles it's
[869.12 - 872.88] not just clogged arteries it's not just
[871.04 - 875.92] clogged valves right
[872.88 - 877.44] it's more than that it's dirty blood
[875.92 - 879.36] michelle l says check out the dirty
[877.44 - 881.28] blood podcast medical lean podcast at

[885.36 - 889.44] you can go to
[886.72 - 891.28] you can go to a big conference
[889.44 - 893.28] all the medical doctors in the world
[891.28 - 896.08] there that know about heart health they
[893.28 - 898.48] won't talk about this they don't know it
[896.08 - 900.56] this is the way life is right r rose
[898.48 - 902.96] says i got the sickest when i was doing
[900.56 - 906.48] high fat high protein
[902.96 - 908.08] yeah it bogs the heart down
[906.48 - 909.52] i'm not saying you can't if you're an
[908.08 - 910.88] animal protein person i'm not saying you
[909.52 - 912.24] can't have a piece of chicken you can't
[910.88 - 914.00] have a piece of grass-fed beef i'm not
[912.24 - 915.04] saying you can't have
[914.00 - 917.04] you know
[915.04 - 919.52] a piece of fish
[917.04 - 921.04] but we overdo it if you're a vegan and
[919.52 - 922.80] plant-based i'm not saying you can't
[921.04 - 924.40] have walnuts
[922.80 - 925.28] i got some walnuts in the cupboard over
[924.40 - 926.48] here
[925.28 - 927.52] i'm not saying you can't have some
[926.48 - 929.92] walnuts
[927.52 - 932.32] you can't have some nut butter right
[929.92 - 934.08] but we overdo it and we over do it and
[932.32 - 935.52] sometimes when we need to do clean up
[934.08 - 938.64] and clean that filter and clean that
[935.52 - 940.32] liver filter up we can't clean it up
[938.64 - 941.76] because we're running so much fat
[940.32 - 943.68] through there
[941.76 - 944.72] we're running so much fat through there
[943.68 - 946.00] okay
[944.72 - 948.16] and then
[946.00 - 950.96] we get too many poisons built up inside
[948.16 - 952.24] our liver and too many poisons built up
[950.96 - 954.72] inside
[952.24 - 956.48] our organs and then we get the viral
[954.72 - 958.88] issues and then all of a sudden we got
[956.48 - 961.20] the viral issues right
[958.88 - 962.40] the viral issues
[961.20 - 963.92] and then we're sick we get the
[962.40 - 965.68] fibromyalgia the chronic fatigue
[963.92 - 967.76] syndrome the aches and pains the
[965.68 - 971.36] dizziness the vertigo we get the tingles
[967.76 - 973.36] and numbness we get the we get the um
[971.36 - 975.28] brain fog
[973.36 - 977.12] we get all these different things right
[975.28 - 979.44] we get the eye floaters we get the you
[977.12 - 981.04] know we get the the vertigo like i said
[979.44 - 983.92] we get all of that
[981.04 - 986.64] trigeminal neuralgia neck pain back pain
[983.92 - 988.08] ear pain jaw pain right knee pain our
[986.64 - 989.60] knees start blowing out everything
[988.08 - 990.88] starts blowing out we start going
[989.60 - 992.24] downhill
[990.88 - 994.88] because we get all that viral
[992.24 - 998.48] inflammation in there too
[994.88 - 999.52] but one thing's for certain
[998.48 - 1001.60] right now
[999.52 - 1003.36] we're accelerating into
[1001.60 - 1004.88] heart attacks
[1003.36 - 1006.32] blood clots
[1004.88 - 1008.48] strokes
[1006.32 - 1011.36] clogged arteries
[1008.48 - 1013.92] heart problems
[1011.36 - 1015.84] we're in a place where heart failure
[1013.92 - 1018.08] we're in a place where that's
[1015.84 - 1019.68] more so than ever before in our history
[1018.08 - 1021.52] and it's only getting worse and worse
[1019.68 - 1023.52] and worse so let's talk about this for a
[1021.52 - 1027.04] little bit
[1023.52 - 1027.04] so when you eat a stick of butter
[1027.36 - 1031.76] it goes into your bloodstream
[1029.92 - 1033.04] a hunk of that butter goes into your
[1031.76 - 1034.32] bloodstream
[1033.04 - 1036.16] now
[1034.32 - 1037.36] if you like grass-fed butter don't get
[1036.16 - 1040.08] mad
[1037.36 - 1041.44] i i i'm gonna say that you know what
[1040.08 - 1043.92] if you eat
[1041.44 - 1045.84] a block of vegan cheese
[1043.92 - 1047.76] i'm gonna say the same thing
[1045.84 - 1049.44] a block of vegan cheese
[1047.76 - 1051.12] the difference is with butter it feeds
[1049.44 - 1052.40] bugs and that's another story we're on
[1051.12 - 1053.92] cardiovascular
[1052.40 - 1056.00] but you know feeding bugs is another
[1053.92 - 1059.28] story butter does feed all the pathogens
[1056.00 - 1061.28] right when you eat a stick of butter
[1059.28 - 1063.04] okay you guys see this
[1061.28 - 1065.12] tik tok you can't surprise see it tell
[1063.04 - 1068.00] her eat a stick of butter and that
[1065.12 - 1070.00] butter goes down into the stomach
[1068.00 - 1071.44] right now that butter's in the stomach
[1070.00 - 1073.04] right here
[1071.44 - 1074.96] okay
[1073.04 - 1078.88] then that butter
[1074.96 - 1078.88] goes into the to the duodenum
[1079.12 - 1082.40] and then
[1080.40 - 1085.68] that butter starts to get dispersed by
[1082.40 - 1089.60] your bile from your liver
[1085.68 - 1090.96] and as your bile is breaking down
[1089.60 - 1093.28] the butter
[1090.96 - 1095.92] fat
[1093.28 - 1098.32] okay dissolving it
[1095.92 - 1100.96] it's now getting dispersed and going up
[1098.32 - 1103.20] your veins
[1100.96 - 1105.92] now it's going up to veins that are
[1103.20 - 1107.60] attached to your duodenum and your small
[1105.92 - 1109.28] intestinal tract
[1107.60 - 1113.04] those veins
[1109.28 - 1113.04] are sucking the butter up
[1113.36 - 1117.84] and who's doing all the work
[1116.40 - 1119.92] your heart
[1117.84 - 1121.28] your heart you guys on tick tock
[1119.92 - 1124.40] that's who's doing all the work on
[1121.28 - 1125.28] telegram your heart
[1124.40 - 1127.04] okay
[1125.28 - 1130.08] so now your heart's
[1127.04 - 1134.24] trying to suck the butter
[1130.08 - 1136.56] up through your hepatic portal highway
[1134.24 - 1139.84] which is your veins
[1136.56 - 1141.92] attached to your small intestinal tract
[1139.84 - 1142.96] and your heart's trying to pull that
[1141.92 - 1146.08] butter
[1142.96 - 1148.72] up through that intestinal tract
[1146.08 - 1150.64] and up the veins
[1148.72 - 1153.84] into your liver
[1150.64 - 1156.64] so now the stick of butter
[1153.84 - 1156.64] is in your liver
[1156.80 - 1159.76] okay
[1157.60 - 1163.04] as the years go by
[1159.76 - 1165.20] butter gets trapped in that liver
[1163.04 - 1168.88] now you don't know it even if you didn't
[1165.20 - 1170.40] get a diagnosis you got a fatty liver
[1168.88 - 1171.92] and then
[1170.40 - 1174.16] okay
[1171.92 - 1176.96] your heart
[1174.16 - 1178.40] is getting tired
[1176.96 - 1180.72] and now you're getting high blood
[1178.40 - 1182.00] pressure
[1180.72 - 1184.08] now you're getting
[1182.00 - 1185.36] high blood pressure
[1184.08 - 1187.60] you don't have to get high blood
[1185.36 - 1189.28] pressure for this to happen
[1187.60 - 1192.80] this can happen and then you get high
[1189.28 - 1194.56] blood pressure later later later
[1192.80 - 1198.00] it's like people who say my
[1194.56 - 1200.96] great-grandmother ate butter
[1198.00 - 1202.24] her whole life and she's 90 years old

[1368.08 - 1371.52] he doesn't know anything about your
[1369.44 - 1372.72] health history he left a comment saying
[1371.52 - 1375.36] that you're 90 and you've been eating
[1372.72 - 1377.28] butter your whole life and you're fine
[1375.36 - 1378.96] all right i gotta go like i know there's
[1377.28 - 1380.32] more i'm gonna call you back after the
[1378.96 - 1385.32] show
[1380.32 - 1385.32] okay i'll call you back after the show
[1388.32 - 1392.88] michelle l says they don't care to ask
[1390.64 - 1394.48] so the point is is where i'm going with
[1392.88 - 1396.56] all of this right
[1394.48 - 1399.12] so what people don't realize is that
[1396.56 - 1401.28] their heart is doing double time
[1399.12 - 1403.28] and heart health is really being
[1401.28 - 1404.48] cautious to how much
[1403.28 - 1406.48] grease
[1404.48 - 1408.40] whatever we're greasing our wheels with
[1406.48 - 1410.40] goes in our body if that's butter if
[1408.40 - 1411.76] that's anything else april tap says my
[1410.40 - 1413.52] parents keep saying their high blood
[1411.76 - 1416.56] pressure is hereditary they won't listen
[1413.52 - 1418.56] to me to the true cause
[1416.56 - 1421.04] anyone can get rid of their mystery high
[1418.56 - 1422.88] blood pressure anyone can get rid of
[1421.04 - 1425.12] their mystery hot blood blood that is
[1422.88 - 1426.96] one thing you can get rid of you do the
[1425.12 - 1428.88] right things you can get rid of mystery
[1426.96 - 1431.76] of high blood pressure i can't tell you
[1428.88 - 1432.96] how many people i've talked to were able
[1431.76 - 1434.88] to just get rid of their high blood
[1432.96 - 1436.88] pressure and it's gone boom it's gone
[1434.88 - 1439.28] like gone that's it
[1436.88 - 1442.84] and my grandmother fed me sticks of
[1439.28 - 1445.12] butter as a baby oh avis
[1442.84 - 1448.08] right and that's what causes the
[1445.12 - 1449.52] fluctuating high blood pressure right
[1448.08 - 1452.56] it's a liver
[1449.52 - 1453.36] that's getting too much fat stored up in
[1452.56 - 1454.64] it
[1453.36 - 1457.20] and a heart
[1454.64 - 1458.64] that's trying to regulate
[1457.20 - 1461.04] so it's a heart that's trying to
[1458.64 - 1463.12] regulate so fluctuating fluctuating
[1461.04 - 1464.88] mysterious high blood pressure
[1463.12 - 1466.64] even if it's like for one month and then
[1464.88 - 1468.16] one month it's off one month it's on
[1466.64 - 1470.56] three months it's on three months it's
[1468.16 - 1474.08] off it's on it's off right it's
[1470.56 - 1475.76] fluctuating right sunrood says love your
[1474.08 - 1477.28] live shows i'm so honored you're here
[1475.76 - 1480.72] truly okay
[1477.28 - 1484.24] that fluctuating blood pressure
[1480.72 - 1485.60] is the heart trying to regulate
[1484.24 - 1487.52] it's the heart trying to regulate so
[1485.60 - 1490.16] it's the vagus nerves
[1487.52 - 1492.24] it's messages coming from your brain
[1490.16 - 1494.08] sending them down your brain stem
[1492.24 - 1496.00] sending them down the vagus nerves
[1494.08 - 1498.08] sending them to the heart
[1496.00 - 1500.32] and and trying to help the heart
[1498.08 - 1502.96] regulate why the heart is trying to
[1500.32 - 1506.96] struggle if the heart is actually trying
[1502.96 - 1508.96] to to regulate with your vagus nerves
[1506.96 - 1510.80] there's so much fat in the bloodstream
[1508.96 - 1513.84] and fat inside the liver every single
[1510.80 - 1515.44] day that the gas has to be put on so you
[1513.84 - 1517.92] get these messages from the brain so
[1515.44 - 1521.20] what happens is
[1517.92 - 1523.84] you get messages from the brain
[1521.20 - 1525.36] going down the vagus nerves heading to
[1523.84 - 1527.44] your heart
[1525.36 - 1529.92] telling your heart put on the brakes
[1527.44 - 1531.84] step on the gas put on the brakes step
[1529.92 - 1533.36] on the gas put on the brakes step on the
[1531.84 - 1534.64] gas put on the brakes that's what's
[1533.36 - 1537.44] happening
[1534.64 - 1539.84] because the liver is clogged and getting
[1537.44 - 1542.32] clogged every day with a fatty liver
[1539.84 - 1544.00] because of so much of that butter and so
[1542.32 - 1545.44] much of that grease and so much of those
[1544.00 - 1547.12] nut butters too
[1545.44 - 1549.12] nut butters
[1547.12 - 1550.72] yeah too much nut butters this is
[1549.12 - 1553.12] medical medium information just letting
[1550.72 - 1554.80] everybody know
[1553.12 - 1556.56] can't go to a hard conference and hear
[1554.80 - 1558.88] this stuff
[1556.56 - 1560.80] right we can't i can't go anywhere and
[1558.88 - 1563.12] hear this stuff but this is so important
[1560.80 - 1564.56] michelle says it makes so much sense i'm
[1563.12 - 1566.32] honored to hear it
[1564.56 - 1568.24] really happy you're here
[1566.32 - 1570.24] so yeah in in
[1568.24 - 1572.48] so what we're dealing with is mysterious
[1570.24 - 1575.60] high blood pressure it's one thing
[1572.48 - 1577.60] let's talk about strokes
[1575.60 - 1580.48] okay
[1577.60 - 1581.92] strokes happen for a couple of reasons
[1580.48 - 1584.88] one is
[1581.92 - 1586.08] the veins in the arteries the tiny
[1584.88 - 1587.92] arteries
[1586.08 - 1589.28] tiny arteries see that see the arteries
[1587.92 - 1592.24] right there
[1589.28 - 1594.56] blood vessels and small arteries see all
[1592.24 - 1596.72] the small arteries right
[1594.56 - 1598.88] they start getting
[1596.72 - 1601.84] clogged up
[1598.88 - 1604.00] they start narrowing everything starts
[1601.84 - 1606.24] to narrow okay
[1604.00 - 1608.40] but that doesn't mean you're gonna get a
[1606.24 - 1612.32] stroke ever you can
[1608.40 - 1614.56] live your life without a stroke
[1612.32 - 1616.08] and you can have narrowing in all the
[1614.56 - 1618.00] arteries and all the little tiny
[1616.08 - 1619.76] arteries right in blood vessels you can
[1618.00 - 1621.52] have those you could have those but
[1619.76 - 1624.24] here's what does the stroke
[1621.52 - 1624.24] invaders
[1624.64 - 1630.56] invaders right here
[1627.84 - 1631.76] clusters of viruses clusters of
[1630.56 - 1635.36] pathogens
[1631.76 - 1638.08] clusters of pathogens viruses and toxins
[1635.36 - 1641.20] clusters of these
[1638.08 - 1644.16] they have to find their way through
[1641.20 - 1646.08] all the narrowed arteries
[1644.16 - 1649.92] viruses tend to
[1646.08 - 1651.44] become cluster clumps
[1649.92 - 1652.84] cluster
[1651.44 - 1655.68] beep
[1652.84 - 1657.12] bleep that's what they become cluster
[1655.68 - 1660.16] bleeps
[1657.12 - 1660.16] what happened is
[1660.56 - 1664.32] your white blood cells
[1663.20 - 1667.12] okay
[1664.32 - 1669.68] want to kill the viruses
[1667.12 - 1672.56] so they jump on the viruses
[1669.68 - 1675.52] to try to stop the viruses
[1672.56 - 1679.36] but if you got too many narrowings
[1675.52 - 1681.60] in all the different blood vessels
[1679.36 - 1683.68] too many narrowings
[1681.60 - 1686.32] what happens is when the your immune
[1683.68 - 1688.64] system tries to do its job and jump on
[1686.32 - 1691.12] the virus
[1688.64 - 1692.64] it clumps up and then you got like a big
[1691.12 - 1695.68] clump
[1692.64 - 1698.40] of bugs and viruses and everything right
[1695.68 - 1700.88] and immune cells everything's just
[1698.40 - 1703.20] battling each other and that clump
[1700.88 - 1705.92] just starts to get bigger and bigger and
[1703.20 - 1708.96] that clump is now traveling through
[1705.92 - 1710.72] narrowed passageways and then it gets to
[1708.96 - 1712.64] the brain
[1710.72 - 1715.76] when it gets to the brain
[1712.64 - 1720.00] when that cluster of pathogens and
[1715.76 - 1720.00] immune cells get to the brain
[1720.16 - 1725.36] everything starts to get smaller and
[1722.56 - 1726.40] smaller but the clump is bigger and
[1725.36 - 1728.88] bigger
[1726.40 - 1732.64] finally it blocks
[1728.88 - 1732.64] a blood vessel completely
[1732.72 - 1736.64] but it wouldn't have happened
[1735.52 - 1739.04] if
[1736.64 - 1741.44] your whole life you didn't have your
[1739.04 - 1743.36] bloodstream filled with a ton of fat
[1741.44 - 1745.28] your liver filled the fat
[1743.36 - 1746.88] and the arteries filled with fat this is
[1745.28 - 1748.08] advanced medical medium information if
[1746.88 - 1749.68] you heard it here you heard it here
[1748.08 - 1752.48] first
[1749.68 - 1755.84] just so you know smokey mountain smoking
[1752.48 - 1755.84] mountain paradise good to see you guys
[1756.24 - 1759.60] so
[1757.76 - 1762.32] what happens is that we can do something
[1759.60 - 1763.44] about it right we can protect ourselves
[1762.32 - 1764.64] okay
[1763.44 - 1766.88] so
[1764.64 - 1768.40] right now people are overloaded with
[1766.88 - 1769.36] toxins
[1768.40 - 1772.08] and
[1769.36 - 1772.08] toxins
[1772.24 - 1777.52] also when they're really foreign toxins
[1775.84 - 1779.84] demand
[1777.52 - 1781.68] your immune cells to jump on those too
[1779.84 - 1783.12] right now people are getting foreign
[1781.68 - 1785.04] toxins
[1783.12 - 1787.20] lots of them
[1785.04 - 1789.68] and the foreign toxins from everywhere
[1787.20 - 1790.96] all places air fresheners scented
[1789.68 - 1793.36] candles
[1790.96 - 1794.40] just everywhere to pharmaceuticals like
[1793.36 - 1796.80] everywhere just people are getting
[1794.40 - 1798.56] foreign toxins through everything the
[1796.80 - 1800.00] antibiotics there's foreign toxins in
[1798.56 - 1802.88] that there's 40 foreign toxins in
[1800.00 - 1805.28] everything right so all this stuff
[1802.88 - 1807.04] right centicams clones perfumes
[1805.28 - 1809.20] laundry detergents fabric softeners
[1807.04 - 1811.76] cleaning supplies like all this stuff
[1809.20 - 1813.52] foreign foreign toxins and and your
[1811.76 - 1815.12] immune cells have to eat up those
[1813.52 - 1816.96] foreign toxins so when you have a
[1815.12 - 1819.76] foreign toxin so let's get some toxins
[1816.96 - 1822.88] see if we can find some of that right
[1819.76 - 1826.40] when you get some foreign toxins okay
[1822.88 - 1829.76] let's say you're doing some fish oil
[1826.40 - 1830.48] so there's mercury in fish oil
[1829.76 - 1832.40] so
[1830.48 - 1833.92] that's a foreign toxin so say you're
[1832.40 - 1836.16] taking your fish oil every day and you
[1833.92 - 1839.84] think you're helping yourself
[1836.16 - 1839.84] here's your fish oil right
[1840.16 - 1844.64] the mercury in there
[1842.40 - 1846.48] gets eaten up by your immune system so
[1844.64 - 1848.84] your white blood cells are trying to eat
[1846.48 - 1851.52] up that mercury to protect you
[1848.84 - 1854.16] okay and when it when it's eating up all
[1851.52 - 1855.60] these forward toxins constantly
[1854.16 - 1858.72] constantly
[1855.60 - 1860.16] it can clump it can cluster around all
[1858.72 - 1863.12] the toxins
[1860.16 - 1865.76] and that cluster can find a narrowing
[1863.12 - 1867.44] somewhere in the brain or brain stem
[1865.76 - 1869.28] anywhere it could find a narrowing
[1867.44 - 1871.28] anywhere and that's where we get in
[1869.28 - 1873.60] trouble right there
[1871.28 - 1875.68] and then boom we've got a stroke
[1873.60 - 1876.56] there's no evidence whatsoever to back
[1875.68 - 1879.92] up
[1876.56 - 1881.76] in any medical literature
[1879.92 - 1884.24] or studies
[1881.76 - 1886.00] yeah i mean there's no evidence to back
[1884.24 - 1888.24] up what there's no evidence to back up
[1886.00 - 1890.80] this information
[1888.24 - 1893.20] because you heard it from here first
[1890.80 - 1894.56] and then science takes it later i mean
[1893.20 - 1896.48] like they always do with medical mean
[1894.56 - 1899.20] information look if you're if you're
[1896.48 - 1901.28] here to really learn something i'll just
[1899.20 - 1903.44] fill you in right now okay medical
[1901.28 - 1904.80] medium information is the first
[1903.44 - 1906.88] to bring epstein-barr causing
[1904.80 - 1909.76] hashimoto's thyroiditis ra and
[1906.88 - 1912.16] fibromyalgia right advanced information
[1909.76 - 1914.16] science took it after the fact it was
[1912.16 - 1916.08] published by medical medium medical
[1914.16 - 1918.16] medium also
[1916.08 - 1921.76] brought reactivated epstein-barr being
[1918.16 - 1924.40] long plagued so the long plant the long
[1921.76 - 1926.72] plague the long-haul plague right
[1924.40 - 1929.36] so the long-haul plague now doctors are
[1926.72 - 1930.80] saying it's reactivated epstein-barr
[1929.36 - 1932.72] that was medical medium information
[1930.80 - 1934.64] public for published first
[1932.72 - 1936.24] the long-haul pandemic
[1934.64 - 1937.92] so you might be sitting here saying
[1936.24 - 1939.60] there's no substantiation behind your
[1937.92 - 1941.28] stuff then tell science research to stop
[1939.60 - 1943.84] taking all my stuff
[1941.28 - 1945.92] dude call up science and research and
[1943.84 - 1947.68] tell them to stop poaching all of
[1945.92 - 1949.36] medical medium stuff
[1947.68 - 1950.96] okay why don't you do that for me once
[1949.36 - 1952.40] you go somewhere else
[1950.96 - 1954.64] i'd like you here though once you go
[1952.40 - 1957.20] somewhere else and tell them to stop
[1954.64 - 1959.04] taking medical medium information please
[1957.20 - 1961.44] or cite it
[1959.04 - 1963.52] back to where it originates
[1961.44 - 1965.36] right so that's just a couple of things
[1963.52 - 1966.32] i've been going on all day about that
[1965.36 - 1968.56] right
[1966.32 - 1969.92] okay this is funny
[1968.56 - 1971.92] medical medium
[1969.92 - 1973.92] right talks about celery juice does for
[1971.92 - 1975.60] everybody and now
[1973.92 - 1977.68] all of a sudden
[1975.60 - 1980.56] it's being picked up
[1977.68 - 1982.08] by some of the biggest like industries
[1980.56 - 1984.24] in the world now and they're all gonna
[1982.08 - 1985.04] be putting out celery juice
[1984.24 - 1986.22] right
[1985.04 - 1987.36] i guess uh
[1986.22 - 1988.96] [Music]
[1987.36 - 1990.16] what does that tell you right there and
[1988.96 - 1991.44] they're gonna be spouting out all its
[1990.16 - 1992.96] benefits
[1991.44 - 1994.08] much of what medical medium put out
[1992.96 - 1995.12] first
[1994.08 - 1997.36] anyway
[1995.12 - 1999.20] but that's another show let's not talk
[1997.36 - 2001.44] about all that stuff right now let's
[1999.20 - 2004.00] talk about how to heal and how to
[2001.44 - 2006.56] protect ourselves
[2004.00 - 2009.60] this isn't complicated
[2006.56 - 2013.28] none of this is complicated
[2009.60 - 2016.72] just gotta lower down your fats
[2013.28 - 2018.48] if you're a pork eater stop eating pork
[2016.72 - 2020.32] that's all
[2018.48 - 2021.44] keep with chicken stay with chicken and
[2020.32 - 2024.08] turkey
[2021.44 - 2025.44] but lower your chicken and turkey just
[2024.08 - 2026.56] lower it
[2025.44 - 2028.80] okay
[2026.56 - 2032.88] if you're if you're a bambi eater if
[2028.80 - 2036.32] you're a deer eater if you like deer
[2032.88 - 2036.32] lower your amount of deer
[2036.40 - 2041.36] if you like venison
[2038.64 - 2044.08] lower your amount of venison
[2041.36 - 2045.44] don't eat a lot of venison
[2044.08 - 2047.52] right
[2045.44 - 2048.80] if you like
[2047.52 - 2051.52] i don't know how many of you guys are
[2048.80 - 2054.64] eating reindeer right now
[2051.52 - 2054.64] if you like cow
[2056.48 - 2062.16] if you like cow lower your amount of cow
[2060.80 - 2064.56] right a friend of mine said one mean
[2062.16 - 2065.92] grass-fed beef i'm like
[2064.56 - 2067.60] you're eating cow right you're eating
[2065.92 - 2069.44] cow i said how's it go cow what do you
[2067.60 - 2070.80] mean i'm eating cow
[2069.44 - 2072.40] what are you talking about that's crazy
[2070.80 - 2073.60] i'm not eating cow
[2072.40 - 2075.12] i said
[2073.60 - 2076.16] don't you have a grasp of beef he's like
[2075.12 - 2077.84] yeah
[2076.16 - 2079.92] i said you're eating cow
[2077.84 - 2081.28] how's it going because i'm not eating
[2079.92 - 2083.44] cow
[2081.28 - 2085.84] i said you're eating cow
[2083.44 - 2088.40] anyway the point is if you're eating cow
[2085.84 - 2089.28] lower the amount of cow you're eating
[2088.40 - 2091.92] right
[2089.28 - 2093.92] lower the amount
[2091.92 - 2095.44] if you're eating nut butters lower the
[2093.92 - 2097.76] amount of nut butters if you're eating
[2095.44 - 2100.32] avocado bring them down a little bit
[2097.76 - 2102.16] don't do three avocados every single day
[2100.32 - 2103.92] somebody could be doing two avocados and
[2102.16 - 2106.16] they have chicken and they have coconut
[2103.92 - 2108.24] oil and they have you know what i mean
[2106.16 - 2110.72] give the body a break that's what i'm
[2108.24 - 2114.40] talking about so the whole point is is
[2110.72 - 2116.72] give your body a break learn how to
[2114.40 - 2118.24] bring it down a little bit
[2116.72 - 2121.20] cold white spring says some people don't
[2118.24 - 2122.88] even know that meat is muscle
[2121.20 - 2126.08] some people
[2122.88 - 2128.40] how about almost everybody
[2126.08 - 2130.40] but that's a really good point how about
[2128.40 - 2133.04] almost everybody so when it comes down
[2130.40 - 2135.20] to cardiovascular cardiovascular health
[2133.04 - 2136.64] okay keep in mind
[2135.20 - 2138.80] and i love it when somebody says there's
[2136.64 - 2139.52] no substantiated evidence to back this
[2138.80 - 2141.84] up
[2139.52 - 2143.44] three years later where'd the person go
[2141.84 - 2145.68] where'd the guy go who was doing his
[2143.44 - 2148.00] keto diet and exercising he's 41 years
[2145.68 - 2150.16] old oh he died
[2148.00 - 2152.48] what heart attack
[2150.16 - 2155.20] i can't tell you how many guys are dying
[2152.48 - 2156.72] right now women too how many dudes are
[2155.20 - 2158.56] going down
[2156.72 - 2161.04] how many dudes you guys
[2158.56 - 2163.04] it's crazy actually how many dudes are
[2161.04 - 2164.64] getting the the myocarditis how many
[2163.04 - 2166.32] dudes are getting the endocarditis how
[2164.64 - 2167.84] many how many days are getting the heart
[2166.32 - 2169.60] attacks how many dudes are getting like
[2167.84 - 2170.80] angina until they get a heart attack how
[2169.60 - 2172.80] many guys are getting the cloned
[2170.80 - 2175.44] arteries it's crazy
[2172.80 - 2175.44] how much
[2175.60 - 2181.36] should dogs so okay it's a question nika
[2178.24 - 2183.68] yeah should dogs eat meat every day
[2181.36 - 2186.32] dogs should not be vegan
[2183.68 - 2188.80] a dog's intestinal tract is this long
[2186.32 - 2189.60] let me show you okay
[2188.80 - 2192.56] so
[2189.60 - 2194.64] so dogs should not be eat dogs should
[2192.56 - 2196.80] not be vegan they should get some fruits
[2194.64 - 2199.28] and vegetables dogs should get wild
[2196.80 - 2200.96] foods fruits and vegetables they should
[2199.28 - 2203.36] but that's a dog's intestinal tract
[2200.96 - 2203.36] right there
[2203.60 - 2206.96] okay
[2205.12 - 2209.20] that's a human's intestinal tract right
[2206.96 - 2209.20] there
[2209.44 - 2212.48] that's a dog's intestinal tract
[2210.80 - 2214.64] basically right there i mean not not
[2212.48 - 2216.32] totally it's more than this but
[2214.64 - 2220.88] basically that's what it is
[2216.32 - 2222.80] and so yeah dogs are dogs are carnivore
[2220.88 - 2224.16] but i'm not anti-animal protein medical
[2222.80 - 2225.60] medium information supports animal
[2224.16 - 2227.20] protein eaters because you can still
[2225.60 - 2229.20] heal on medical medium information while
[2227.20 - 2230.80] eating animal protein and you can still
[2229.20 - 2232.16] eat you can still be vegan and
[2230.80 - 2235.44] plant-based and you know some people
[2232.16 - 2236.48] think of anti-plant-based anti-vegan
[2235.44 - 2238.32] because they're confused because they
[2236.48 - 2239.68] don't understand i never took a side of
[2238.32 - 2241.84] an aisle they're wondering why how come
[2239.68 - 2243.12] i never took a side of the aisle in the
[2241.84 - 2244.08] health realm you're either one or the
[2243.12 - 2246.00] other
[2244.08 - 2248.16] any speakers in health anybody they're
[2246.00 - 2249.44] either vegan or they're animal protein
[2248.16 - 2250.96] if you want to if you want to know about
[2249.44 - 2252.72] oxalates
[2250.96 - 2254.40] fear of faith says what are we supposed
[2252.72 - 2256.72] to eat already don't eat vegetables
[2254.40 - 2258.96] because histamine carbs oxalates
[2256.72 - 2263.20] salicylic acid acid so watch the
[2258.96 - 2263.20] oxalates episode on rumble
[2264.08 - 2267.60] so i would watch that in rumble you guys
