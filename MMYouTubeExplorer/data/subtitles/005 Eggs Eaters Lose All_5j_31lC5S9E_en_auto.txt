[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're
[14.48 - 21.40] one of them whether you're dealing with
[17.56 - 25.88] anxiety depression endometriosis acne
[21.40 - 28.44] eczema autoimmune thyroid lime brain fog
[25.88 - 31.20] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.20 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 46.16] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 46.16] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[48.12 - 54.76] William hey everybody we're talking
[50.88 - 57.64] about eggs and why eaters lose all and
[54.76 - 60.24] don't win anything I got nothing against
[57.64 - 63.80] eggs that's not what it is I'm just the
[60.24 - 67.68] messenger of something no one wants to
[63.80 - 71.04] believe the truth on how eggs were
[67.68 - 75.40] weaponized and used against us and when
[71.04 - 77.92] you hear how you will never look at eggs
[75.40 - 81.48] the same
[77.92 - 83.72] again the one question all these years
[81.48 - 88.00] everyone who knows me personally has
[83.72 - 91.68] asked me is what do I know and how much
[88.00 - 93.92] do I know give me the SK scary stuff aw
[91.68 - 96.92] so you guys are my friends I'm going to
[93.92 - 99.68] fill you in on what I know on what
[96.92 - 103.40] Spirit of compassion told me many years
[99.68 - 106.28] ago when I was younger about guess what
[103.40 - 109.28] eggs like so many secrets of the health
[106.28 - 111.96] industry you won't find this information
[109.28 - 115.64] out there anywhere else so let me take
[111.96 - 118.84] you back to the 1920s to when pathology
[115.64 - 122.08] was expanding the search for what causes
[118.84 - 125.12] disease truly began and even though
[122.08 - 127.60] medicine was in its infancy there was a
[125.12 - 131.92] private group in the pharmaceutical and
[127.60 - 135.08] medical world that no one was aware of
[131.92 - 137.76] it involved investors and interests and
[135.08 - 141.24] a think tank and they were focused on
[137.76 - 142.72] something that would lead us to how sick
[141.24 - 146.36] we are
[142.72 - 149.28] today and why we are getting sicker than
[146.36 - 152.24] ever before this mysterious group of
[149.28 - 153.96] people were learning about bugs not the
[152.24 - 156.48] ones that fly around
[153.96 - 158.28] like and you know and other little
[156.48 - 161.00] insect sounds and everything else not
[158.28 - 164.64] the mosquitoes not those kind of bugs
[161.00 - 168.08] they were focused on other bugs
[164.64 - 172.44] pathogens and realizing how dangerous
[168.08 - 175.44] they can be catching them harboring them
[172.44 - 178.24] holding them hostage these little
[175.44 - 181.44] pathogens and what pathogens am I
[178.24 - 184.92] talking about virus uses and
[181.44 - 188.76] bacteria and they're realizing that they
[184.92 - 192.72] may be able to use these bugs but in
[188.76 - 195.40] order to make more pathogens more bugs
[192.72 - 198.80] cuz how can you use them if you can't
[195.40 - 201.84] keep on recreating them the Private
[198.80 - 204.08] Industry needed to figure out how to
[201.84 - 205.84] grow them it's like anything you grow
[204.08 - 207.68] it's like if you want to grow something
[205.84 - 209.80] you just got to learn how to grow it
[207.68 - 212.08] right you want to grow a garden you want
[209.80 - 213.96] grow some tomato plants you want to grow
[212.08 - 216.96] more Tomatoes got to figure out how to
[213.96 - 221.20] do it well they had to figure out how to
[216.96 - 224.72] farm these bugs so it was bug farming
[221.20 - 228.60] and even then they knew viruses and
[224.72 - 231.40] bacteria needed something to sustain
[228.60 - 233.92] itself needed a food you know how like
[231.40 - 237.80] you're hungry are you hungry right now
[233.92 - 241.92] and we need food to sustain ourselves
[237.80 - 244.52] well they knew something with these bugs
[241.92 - 246.96] that they needed something like we
[244.52 - 248.88] needed something cuz they were like well
[246.96 - 251.08] bugs need something well we need
[248.88 - 254.24] something everybody needs something the
[251.08 - 257.88] Private Industry also knew that all
[254.24 - 261.92] viruses and bacteria were alive The
[257.88 - 265.44] Details Matter here the Private Industry
[261.92 - 268.84] knew viruses and bacteria were alive not
[265.44 - 273.12] the public one because everybody has
[268.84 - 277.24] been told all these years and now the
[273.12 - 281.04] viruses are not really alive and all
[277.24 - 283.20] viruses and bacteria don't eat food they
[281.04 - 285.24] just don't eat that's what we're told
[283.20 - 288.28] too all these years like why would a
[285.24 - 292.04] virus or bacteria actually eat
[288.28 - 294.16] like like why would it eat and spirit of
[292.04 - 297.92] compassion has been the only source
[294.16 - 300.08] saying for decades now that bugs eat to
[297.92 - 303.04] stay alive
[300.08 - 306.08] because the truth is the Private
[303.04 - 308.36] Industry has always known this you have
[306.08 - 310.72] to understand something everything you
[308.36 - 314.48] know about science and research in
[310.72 - 317.60] health is controlled or they only let
[314.48 - 320.84] certain information out of the gate
[317.60 - 323.56] there's so much classified classified
[320.84 - 325.56] research and science see the difference
[323.56 - 327.96] all the medical information and research
[325.56 - 330.12] and Science in the health industry both
[327.96 - 334.08] conventional and Alterna ative even
[330.12 - 338.36] today is controlled and someone doesn't
[334.08 - 343.00] want you to know that bugs like viruses
[338.36 - 345.80] and bacteria eat food to stay alive
[343.00 - 348.00] because someone's going to get in
[345.80 - 351.36] trouble down the road if that just keeps
[348.00 - 353.84] on going and going yes they are alive
[351.36 - 356.36] and yes they eat so the industry needed
[353.84 - 358.16] to find a food like we need a food how
[356.36 - 360.16] are we going to keep these bugs alive
[358.16 - 362.80] what are we going to do they need a fuel
[360.16 - 365.96] source something that bugs would feed on
[362.80 - 368.52] pathogens would feed on the goal was to
[365.96 - 371.56] keep bugs alive outside of the human
[368.52 - 373.64] body and allow them to grow in the lab
[371.56 - 376.48] Farm them you know like farm- raised
[373.64 - 378.84] fish you got them wild in the ocean you
[376.48 - 380.88] know like wild caught fish wild fish
[378.84 - 383.96] right and you got them wild in the
[380.88 - 386.72] streams but they Farm the fish so they
[383.96 - 388.48] Farm the salmon you know how do you farm
[386.72 - 390.88] them and keep them growing and then just
[388.48 - 392.76] feed them and find a food they like well
[390.88 - 395.68] the industry needed a perfect
[392.76 - 399.52] environment and tried everything they
[395.68 - 403.20] tried sugar to feed bugs and pathogens
[399.52 - 406.20] and guess what it didn't work because
[403.20 - 409.08] viruses and bacteria don't eat sugar
[406.20 - 413.28] they found sugar did the opposite how
[409.08 - 415.60] weird is that Sugar inhibited the growth
[413.28 - 418.16] of these pathogens they couldn't go
[415.60 - 421.04] anywhere or develop or proliferate with
[418.16 - 424.36] sugar so then the industry tried various
[421.04 - 426.36] animal products they tried meat think
[424.36 - 430.08] about that one for a second did that
[426.36 - 433.48] work see that wasn't the winning ticket
[430.08 - 436.24] either it didn't work animal meat would
[433.48 - 437.80] not feed the bugs cuz I'm sure some of
[436.24 - 439.00] you plant basers out there like yeah
[437.80 - 440.84] that's what's doing it probably that's
[439.00 - 443.28] what's doing it you know they
[440.84 - 447.84] systematically went through every food
[443.28 - 451.24] and stumbl across just one how weird is
[447.84 - 454.60] this just one what they learned was that
[451.24 - 456.96] when they examined an egg a fresh egg
[454.60 - 461.32] they noticed that on the outside of the
[456.96 - 463.84] shell bacteria was capable of living the
[461.32 - 466.40] bacteria could live and survive on the
[463.84 - 468.36] outside of an egg you ever hear of like
[466.40 - 470.68] salmonella being on like the outside of
[468.36 - 474.04] eggs you know over the years like whoa
[470.68 - 476.56] there's a recall from 10 Farms out there
[474.04 - 477.96] and we need all the eggs all destroyed
[476.56 - 479.92] that are in the grocery stores because
[477.96 - 482.24] there's a salmonella outbreak break and
[479.92 - 484.60] it's on the eggs it's on the eggshells
[482.24 - 487.80] like well why is the salmonella still
[484.60 - 489.84] alive why is it still alive the eggs
[487.80 - 492.08] well it's been days and days and days
[489.84 - 494.44] later they've been packed they've been
[492.08 - 496.20] shipped they've been on trucks tractor
[494.44 - 498.08] trailers they've been on highways for
[496.20 - 500.40] three straight days then they get into a
[498.08 - 502.16] store they're not even packed out yet
[500.40 - 504.12] they're sitting in the back of the the
[502.16 - 506.92] you know the refrigerator section of the
[504.12 - 509.36] grocery store and then a produce manager
[506.92 - 510.80] or a dairy manager comes out he like
[509.36 - 513.68] okay let's get these eggs on the Shelf
[510.80 - 516.96] this is like 10 days later how is
[513.68 - 520.32] Salmonella capable of living on that egg
[516.96 - 523.04] all this time later but check this out
[520.32 - 525.68] okay I talked to an egg farmer and he
[523.04 - 529.92] said well the process is kind of like
[525.68 - 532.08] this Anthony you got to collect the eggs
[529.92 - 534.28] they got to go in the cartons they got
[532.08 - 537.08] to get on a truck they got to be at a
[534.28 - 539.40] waiting area a transition place a
[537.08 - 542.20] station then they're back on another
[539.40 - 546.48] truck then they're driving across the
[542.20 - 548.40] country then they get to the store and
[546.48 - 550.08] now they're in the cold section of the
[548.40 - 553.68] store in the back in the warehouse of
[550.08 - 556.20] the store and then all the Egg Farmers
[553.68 - 558.68] have to call all the stores and yell at
[556.20 - 561.20] them and say can you hurry up and get
[558.68 - 563.08] the eggs on the shelf and then all the
[561.20 - 565.16] stores say we haven't sold our other
[563.08 - 567.04] eggs yet and it's still in the shelf
[565.16 - 569.96] life date the freshness date is still
[567.04 - 572.92] good and we want to sell those out
[569.96 - 575.28] and the Farms are like wait a minute
[572.92 - 577.40] here just hurry up and get them out and
[575.28 - 579.56] so now it's another week in the back of
[577.40 - 581.56] the store and then finally when they
[579.56 - 583.48] sell all the eggs they get the other
[581.56 - 586.04] eggs out they put them on the Shelf
[583.48 - 589.16] we're talking two weeks sometimes we're
[586.04 - 591.52] talking three weeks so Egg Farmers they
[589.16 - 594.40] actually have to put a longer shelf life
[591.52 - 596.40] date on the carton and then here's the
[594.40 - 599.20] funny part then you go to the
[596.40 - 600.60] store oo I like these eggs oh I like
[599.20 - 602.56] these eggs too let me get those okay I'm
[600.60 - 604.32] at the checkout I'm getting my eggs let
[602.56 - 605.92] me go home putting them in the fridge
[604.32 - 608.40] they're nice and fresh there's a good
[605.92 - 611.04] date on them but you don't eat them that
[608.40 - 612.84] day not all of them sometimes people
[611.04 - 615.12] leave eggs in the fridge they're like
[612.84 - 618.04] there in the fridge for like a week
[615.12 - 620.08] that's another week and maybe even more
[618.04 - 622.16] and guess what when there's a salmonella
[620.08 - 624.96] breakout they're like throw out your
[622.16 - 627.08] eggs everybody throw out your eggs
[624.96 - 629.68] meanwhile those eggs are already a month
[627.08 - 633.40] away from when they were hatched I mean
[629.68 - 636.20] laid you guys know what I mean so now
[633.40 - 639.32] before this discovery that bacteria can
[636.20 - 643.88] stay alive on the outside of an egg they
[639.32 - 646.12] kept bugs alive in human blood now this
[643.88 - 649.56] Private Industry many many years ago
[646.12 - 653.00] they tried animal blood and noticed
[649.56 - 656.00] pathogens bugs could not live or Thrive
[653.00 - 659.12] longterm viruses and bacteria they
[656.00 - 662.88] couldn't proliferate or colonize in
[659.12 - 665.84] animal blood easy now remember animal
[662.88 - 669.52] blood on its own I'm talking about human
[665.84 - 672.16] blood on its own not inside the host
[669.52 - 676.24] they found human blood was the only
[672.16 - 679.68] blood that would sustain these bugs and
[676.24 - 682.20] keep the pathogens alive enough so they
[679.68 - 684.80] kept these early pathogens alive using
[682.20 - 686.72] human blood keeping the temperature
[684.80 - 689.04] adequate so it's like let's get a
[686.72 - 690.40] patient in here let's steal some blood
[689.04 - 692.28] let's keep that blood in the
[690.40 - 695.96] refrigerator let's make sure we take
[692.28 - 698.60] some out then let's keep the temperature
[695.96 - 700.80] adequate let's keep the bugs in there
[698.60 - 703.00] let's see how long they can live let's
[700.80 - 705.80] let's analyze them let's see if we can
[703.00 - 707.96] keep them growing enough to stay alive
[705.80 - 709.52] but they won't proliferate and they were
[707.96 - 713.28] in this Jam like how are we going to
[709.52 - 716.64] farm this stuff like how are we going to
[713.28 - 718.24] make these pathogens live longer and
[716.64 - 722.16] isn't that funny because shouldn't you
[718.24 - 725.00] want pathogen not to live like hm we got
[722.16 - 726.60] a plague right now right do we want that
[725.00 - 729.68] virus that's going around right now
[726.60 - 732.08] scaring everybody do we want it to live
[729.68 - 734.24] like do we want all these bugs to live
[732.08 - 736.92] well that's the deal this private
[734.24 - 739.12] industry was about growing and farming
[736.92 - 742.16] bugs and it's going to take us to some
[739.12 - 744.68] other talk later but because they
[742.16 - 747.76] realize humans had a percentage of
[744.68 - 750.80] something inside their blood already
[747.76 - 752.12] that was keeping these bugs at least in
[750.80 - 756.08] a
[752.12 - 759.96] hypnotic state so what was that a
[756.08 - 763.04] percentage of mercury people patients
[759.96 - 766.20] had a percentage of mercury inside their
[763.04 - 770.36] blood and that mercury was keeping the
[766.20 - 774.08] bugs in this hypnotic living state so
[770.36 - 778.64] they can analyze them study them try to
[774.08 - 782.36] keep them alive preserve them sustain
[778.64 - 785.08] them them Mercury was used in almost
[782.36 - 788.16] every aspect of medicine back in the
[785.08 - 791.56] 1920s and a little bit before that too
[788.16 - 793.84] they wanted more they wanted more bugs
[791.56 - 796.76] they needed them to thrive they needed
[793.84 - 800.84] them to grow and colonize and Mercury
[796.76 - 804.24] was preserving them and keeping them
[800.84 - 807.76] alive and sustaining them in that
[804.24 - 811.04] hypnotic State and even partially
[807.76 - 813.16] feeding them but it wasn't enough and
[811.04 - 817.36] they didn't know how like how can we
[813.16 - 821.84] grow more bugs until one patient's blood
[817.36 - 826.64] not only kept the bugs alive it exploded
[821.84 - 828.64] them it exploded them they noticed quick
[826.64 - 831.00] colonizations they were able to watch
[828.64 - 834.04] viruses reproduce
[831.00 - 837.76] rapidly they were able to analyze
[834.04 - 840.88] pathogens recreating themselves in large
[837.76 - 843.40] numbers oh my God it was that kind of
[840.88 - 847.16] moment they're like what was in this
[843.40 - 849.88] person's blood what was in it that did
[847.16 - 852.48] this so they analyzed what the patient
[849.88 - 853.96] was eating so sir um we got to talk to
[852.48 - 856.24] you about what you were eating and what
[853.96 - 858.64] you're eating and stuff why well we just
[856.24 - 861.24] need that information we need to know
[858.64 - 864.52] well okay here's my diet I eat eggs in
[861.24 - 865.40] the morning and um I eat eggs for lunch
[864.52 - 869.28] in the
[865.40 - 872.84] afternoon and I eat eggs for dinner
[869.28 - 876.52] and before I go to bed I eat another
[872.84 - 878.48] egg and they noticed that this patient
[876.52 - 882.64] their diet was
[878.48 - 884.76] 95% eggs and this patient had a lot of
[882.64 - 887.04] their own Chicken cops so a lot of
[884.76 - 889.84] Chicken Shacks on their property and
[887.04 - 894.44] they ate eggs and this is right around
[889.84 - 898.20] the 1920s early 1920s so they were like
[894.44 - 901.24] wait a minute here so they noticed when
[898.20 - 904.36] another other patients blood wasn't
[901.24 - 908.48] allowing pathogens to survive at all
[904.36 - 910.64] their diet comprised of no eggs so now
[908.48 - 913.28] they're like okay we got something here
[910.64 - 915.56] this patient eats no eggs their blood
[913.28 - 918.00] isn't helping at all like the pathogens
[915.56 - 919.60] are just staying hypnotic with the
[918.00 - 921.52] Mercury for a little while inside the
[919.60 - 926.48] blood but then they just die off
[921.52 - 928.76] eventually but this guy's blood is
[926.48 - 930.96] allowing pathogens to thrive right in
[928.76 - 933.48] front of them as if it was a magical
[930.96 - 937.32] magical experience like a miracle was
[933.48 - 940.52] happening and that's what they noticed
[937.32 - 944.64] so but there was the potential for mild
[940.52 - 946.44] growth if someone ate some eggs so then
[944.64 - 949.36] they brought people in were like listen
[946.44 - 953.28] we want you to eat eggs for breakfast
[949.36 - 955.32] only every day s days a week and let's
[953.28 - 956.84] take your blood so then they take their
[955.32 - 959.76] blood and they noticed the pathogens
[956.84 - 961.64] were alive and doing a little bit better
[959.76 - 963.68] and even growing a little bit so then
[961.64 - 966.32] they would tell a patient well we want
[963.68 - 968.84] you to eat eggs for morning and eggs for
[966.32 - 971.08] afternoon but don't eat them for dinner
[968.84 - 974.32] and they took blood and they noticed the
[971.08 - 975.84] pathogens were colonizing even more and
[974.32 - 978.20] then they went back to that other guy
[975.84 - 980.24] and they said we need some more blood
[978.20 - 983.56] and that guy was like sure and they
[980.24 - 988.12] noticed oh my God this is exploding so
[983.56 - 991.60] then they requested all their patients
[988.12 - 993.16] to be eating eggs three times a day and
[991.60 - 995.20] they were even more than that they'd say
[993.16 - 997.08] eat them as much as you like can you
[995.20 - 999.40] imagine some patients were like I'm
[997.08 - 1001.12] getting sick of eggs here I'm getting
[999.40 - 1003.00] sick of eggs right here they said well
[1001.12 - 1004.80] you can eat some other things in between
[1003.00 - 1008.68] you could still eat some other foods but
[1004.80 - 1011.84] eat eggs three times a day and the goal
[1008.68 - 1015.80] was two eggs three times a day that was
[1011.84 - 1018.68] the amount they wanted now this is
[1015.80 - 1022.00] interesting because a lot of people they
[1018.68 - 1024.60] would eat two eggs three times a day but
[1022.00 - 1026.28] some people would eat less eggs some
[1024.60 - 1028.48] people would eat a little more but what
[1026.28 - 1031.32] they noticed out of everything that no
[1028.48 - 1033.72] matter what if eggs were a big part of
[1031.32 - 1037.56] the person's diet the bugs would grow
[1033.72 - 1040.56] quicker no matter what so this led to
[1037.56 - 1044.48] the discovery of a food that was going
[1040.56 - 1046.72] to change history in chronic illness
[1044.48 - 1051.04] you're probably thinking wait in a good
[1046.72 - 1052.88] way or a bad way well let's just say
[1051.04 - 1054.84] hang in there cuz you're going to know
[1052.88 - 1058.32] we're going to talk about it instead of
[1054.84 - 1061.60] using a patient's blood they went for
[1058.32 - 1064.72] the egg itself and that's when they
[1061.60 - 1068.32] realized that when they took a virus or
[1064.72 - 1072.00] bacteria that was in a patient's blood
[1068.32 - 1075.96] and now placed it on the outside of an
[1072.00 - 1078.68] eggshell the virus and bacteria was able
[1075.96 - 1081.24] to survive they started connect Con in
[1078.68 - 1085.00] the dots so what's the next phase what
[1081.24 - 1086.56] is it it was to cut the top of the egg
[1085.00 - 1090.04] off the
[1086.56 - 1092.68] eggshell and cut the top of an eggshell
[1090.04 - 1095.00] that was fresh from a fresh egg keep the
[1092.68 - 1099.40] temperature of the egg at the right
[1095.00 - 1103.48] level and then insert the bacteria and
[1099.40 - 1107.32] viruses into the egg and of course add a
[1103.48 - 1111.04] little nutmeg and cinnamon actually
[1107.32 - 1113.80] no add a tiny bit of mercury what else
[1111.04 - 1115.12] would the medical industry be adding and
[1113.80 - 1118.24] that's what they did they put a little
[1115.12 - 1120.72] bit of mercury inside the egg with the
[1118.24 - 1124.08] virus and bacteria it's a brilliant
[1120.72 - 1126.80] brilliant Discovery and and scheme and
[1124.08 - 1130.96] then what would happen they reproduced
[1126.80 - 1135.08] and colonized rapidly viruses bacteria
[1130.96 - 1136.88] the farm raising happened boom they got
[1135.08 - 1140.08] it does this remind you guys of
[1136.88 - 1142.80] something why are we told to not leave
[1140.08 - 1145.48] that egg salad with the Mayo
[1142.80 - 1148.56] unrefrigerated in the sun too long at a
[1145.48 - 1152.68] picnic or a party right like why are we
[1148.56 - 1155.20] told well because bacteria will find it
[1152.68 - 1157.68] and colonized on the eggs and in the
[1155.20 - 1161.08] Mayo which contains eggs in the egg
[1157.68 - 1164.32] salad and then food poisoning commences
[1161.08 - 1168.48] here we come so let me spell this out
[1164.32 - 1173.08] for you the classified industry took
[1168.48 - 1177.36] your favorite food used it in labs to
[1173.08 - 1180.56] breed viruses and bacteria farming Farm
[1177.36 - 1184.00] raising them creating many different
[1180.56 - 1188.48] strains and mutations that weren't out
[1184.00 - 1191.40] yet in human nature and somehow somehow
[1188.48 - 1193.44] these pathogens got out of the labs and
[1191.40 - 1196.76] into people I don't know how that
[1193.44 - 1199.08] happened um that they just walked out of
[1196.76 - 1201.32] the lab you know the virus is just got
[1199.08 - 1203.12] off the they got out of the pre petri
[1201.32 - 1204.88] dish they got out of the egg they
[1203.12 - 1207.32] crawled out and they just walked drawn
[1204.88 - 1209.16] out hey I'm putting on my shoes got my
[1207.32 - 1210.12] coat got my umbrella we're all heading
[1209.16 - 1214.56] out of the
[1210.12 - 1217.80] labs yeah how do they get out okay and
[1214.56 - 1220.88] this led to the early explosion of
[1217.80 - 1223.56] chronic illness in the 1940s and 1950s
[1220.88 - 1226.68] when women were filing in to their
[1223.56 - 1230.76] doctor's offices with symptoms never
[1226.68 - 1232.96] seen before in our history by 1950 this
[1230.76 - 1235.44] was happening what does this have to do
[1232.96 - 1238.64] with you who cares this is boring who
[1235.44 - 1241.52] cares it's why you're sick now you got a
[1238.64 - 1244.76] symptom it's why you're sick now you got
[1241.52 - 1248.64] eczema it's why you're sick what does
[1244.76 - 1250.68] this have to do with your acne a lot
[1248.64 - 1253.36] that miserable acne that people have
[1250.68 - 1255.88] where they're so upset and they're so I
[1253.36 - 1258.76] mean traumatized by it and it can really
[1255.88 - 1262.32] affect somebody's life on a deep level
[1258.76 - 1266.36] emotionally mentally physically and that
[1262.32 - 1270.32] acne wouldn't be there if it wasn't for
[1266.36 - 1273.40] this this is why you have struggled with
[1270.32 - 1276.56] acne this is the classified private
[1273.40 - 1279.28] industry's fault going all the way back
[1276.56 - 1282.44] it's why you're suffering today it's why
[1279.28 - 1284.76] your bloating is happening because of
[1282.44 - 1287.76] this it's why your endometriosis is
[1284.76 - 1289.44] happening your body pain your fatigue
[1287.76 - 1293.76] and every other condition you can think
[1289.44 - 1298.88] of everything now hm get ready for this
[1293.76 - 1303.12] one the industry wanted us sick the bugs
[1298.88 - 1307.60] just didn't walk on out no they needed
[1303.12 - 1311.68] us sick it was important they created
[1307.60 - 1314.48] illnesses by using bugs now the public
[1311.68 - 1317.08] industry public medical industry public
[1314.48 - 1318.56] research and science public industries
[1317.08 - 1320.64] of all
[1318.56 - 1322.76] they don't know this people work for
[1320.64 - 1324.80] them everything's happy good you go to
[1322.76 - 1326.28] the office whatever you go to the lab
[1324.80 - 1327.56] they don't know this is going on they
[1326.28 - 1329.76] didn't know that this is where it
[1327.56 - 1331.76] started this is the classified stuff
[1329.76 - 1336.28] going all the way back you're not
[1331.76 - 1339.48] supposed to know this so that's what fed
[1336.28 - 1342.28] the industry it kept them fat and happy
[1339.48 - 1345.32] people being sick was the bread and
[1342.28 - 1348.60] butter and bacon and we were fried in a
[1345.32 - 1351.60] pan and our favorite food the egg
[1348.60 - 1355.88] an old survival food that helped Keep Us
[1351.60 - 1360.04] Alive during hard times was used against
[1355.88 - 1363.20] us was used against you was used against
[1360.04 - 1367.16] your children was used against everybody
[1363.20 - 1370.76] you know and it's still being used
[1367.16 - 1374.36] against us unknowingly today we eat the
[1370.76 - 1378.20] egg we feed our bugs we eventually get
[1374.36 - 1381.28] sick if we collect more bugs we feed
[1378.20 - 1385.64] those bugs and we get sicker the
[1381.28 - 1389.28] industry keeps on raising bugs new ones
[1385.64 - 1394.96] and old ones they catalog them secretly
[1389.28 - 1398.52] classifying them they categorize them
[1394.96 - 1400.40] in different strains different
[1398.52 - 1403.24] categories different
[1400.40 - 1404.84] mutations and then they feed them eggs
[1403.24 - 1407.00] while they're doing it they feed them
[1404.84 - 1409.04] eggs while they're doing it and then
[1407.00 - 1412.92] they let them out of the game
[1409.04 - 1416.48] meaning they release them to the public
[1412.92 - 1419.32] mhm they do and we get more bugs because
[1416.48 - 1422.40] of it and then we eat eggs and we keep
[1419.32 - 1425.20] the bugs alive and then we get
[1422.40 - 1428.80] sicker and if you are lucky and you're
[1425.20 - 1432.16] someone with very few bugs or not the
[1428.80 - 1434.52] aggressive strains or aggressive
[1432.16 - 1436.04] mutations you can eat a lot of eggs and
[1434.52 - 1437.28] get away with it for quite a while
[1436.04 - 1439.08] especially if you're eating other good
[1437.28 - 1441.56] foods or taking care of yourself you can
[1439.08 - 1445.12] kind of keep that balance but if you're
[1441.56 - 1449.08] somebody with lime disease neurological
[1445.12 - 1452.28] lime brain fog Hashimoto thyroiditis
[1449.08 - 1456.52] rheumatoid arthritis do you have that
[1452.28 - 1460.76] eczema psoriasis endometriosis fibroids
[1456.52 - 1462.12] cysts lupus Ms ey floaters are you
[1460.76 - 1463.52] somebody with eye floaters so many
[1462.12 - 1467.20] people have so many different kinds of
[1463.52 - 1470.76] ey floaters right eczema psoriasis I
[1467.20 - 1473.52] said that before Vitiligo depression
[1470.76 - 1476.92] crippling anxiety so many people are
[1473.52 - 1479.72] suffering from just debilitating anxiety
[1476.92 - 1482.48] body pain neck pain back pain
[1479.72 - 1484.76] fibromyalgia burning skin Tinkles and
[1482.48 - 1487.76] numbness hives how many people have
[1484.76 - 1491.72] hives out there mystery rashes
[1487.76 - 1495.40] dermatitis Scleroderma rosacea Crohn's
[1491.72 - 1497.96] citis cold sores yeah cold sores
[1495.40 - 1501.16] H guess where those cold sores came from
[1497.96 - 1503.88] from they were raised in eggs going all
[1501.16 - 1507.36] the way back a 100 years and they were
[1503.88 - 1509.88] let out of the gate so your misery with
[1507.36 - 1513.16] cold sores which is herpes simplex one
[1509.88 - 1515.96] lives on and lives on and then we pass
[1513.16 - 1518.32] it on to somebody else and it lives on
[1515.96 - 1520.96] they did this and they used the egg to
[1518.32 - 1525.00] do it it was the only way it could be
[1520.96 - 1528.44] done and then there's sibo and Celiac
[1525.00 - 1531.04] migraines or any autoimmune condition
[1528.44 - 1533.24] you want to avoid eggs if you have any
[1531.04 - 1535.08] of these symptoms or conditions you
[1533.24 - 1538.48] might be saying to yourself I don't eat
[1535.08 - 1541.12] eggs or I don't eat many of them first
[1538.48 - 1543.72] of all you probably eat more eggs than
[1541.12 - 1546.44] you realize throughout your life did you
[1543.72 - 1550.08] ever eat mayonnaise or thousand island
[1546.44 - 1553.16] dressing or animal style fries or animal
[1550.08 - 1556.64] style Burgers pastries cakes cookies
[1553.16 - 1560.24] donuts many different breads or rolls
[1556.64 - 1562.36] did you ever eat pasta and pizza crust
[1560.24 - 1564.92] did you ever have cookie dough there are
[1562.36 - 1566.36] so many foods that have egg in it and
[1564.92 - 1568.04] you might be someone that's like well I
[1566.36 - 1571.56] haven't had a food with egg in it in a
[1568.04 - 1574.84] long time but it sits inside the liver
[1571.56 - 1578.96] for a lifetime residue unless you
[1574.84 - 1582.52] cleanse it out and if you got bugs it'll
[1578.96 - 1586.64] feed off that residue and the bugs will
[1582.52 - 1589.36] have a field day so enough anyway to
[1586.64 - 1592.24] feed these symptoms and conditions even
[1589.36 - 1595.64] when you're off eggs for a while let's
[1592.24 - 1599.12] talk about this what the industry did by
[1595.64 - 1601.48] raising pathogens on your favorite food
[1599.12 - 1603.68] so that when you eat an egg and
[1601.48 - 1606.52] gradually worsen your condition without
[1603.68 - 1609.44] realizing it is
[1606.52 - 1611.40] Despicable and it happens to everybody
[1609.44 - 1613.76] and you eventually get something no
[1611.40 - 1616.92] matter what everybody gets something
[1613.76 - 1619.28] thyroid symptoms at age 40 migraines
[1616.92 - 1623.68] headaches weight gain it the list goes
[1619.28 - 1625.56] on and fatigue hot flashes body pain
[1623.68 - 1630.28] eczema or other skin conditions like I
[1625.56 - 1633.52] said acne now why would eggs play a role
[1630.28 - 1636.92] because these conditions are caused by
[1633.52 - 1639.88] viruses like Epstein bar and shingles
[1636.92 - 1641.32] it's medical medium information that I
[1639.88 - 1643.28] brought out there all through these
[1641.32 - 1644.84] years and doctors are learning about it
[1643.28 - 1647.96] every day and they're helping their
[1644.84 - 1650.76] patients so herpes simplex which is cold
[1647.96 - 1654.56] sorce the fever blister okay herpes
[1650.76 - 1658.48] simplex 1 2 hhv6
[1654.56 - 1661.20] hhv7 undiscovered hhv 10 through 16
[1658.48 - 1664.76] right Epstein bar and over 60 varieties
[1661.20 - 1667.12] of Epstein bar and mutations shingles
[1664.76 - 1670.36] over 30 varieties of shingles and
[1667.12 - 1673.00] mutations strepto coctus bacteria which
[1670.36 - 1674.80] has hundreds of strains undiscovered and
[1673.00 - 1676.72] over 50 different groups that's
[1674.80 - 1680.52] undiscovered that were raised in the
[1676.72 - 1682.84] labs by by the industry so what's in an
[1680.52 - 1687.00] egg that these bugs like to eat let's go
[1682.84 - 1690.36] there next all right protein and enzymes
[1687.00 - 1693.16] but hey Protein that's why you're eating
[1690.36 - 1695.88] eggs yay that's the whole point and
[1693.16 - 1699.32] enzymes can't be bad right the protein
[1695.88 - 1702.40] in an egg is attached to enzymes that
[1699.32 - 1705.16] viruses can easily absorb through their
[1702.40 - 1707.88] membrane because the proteins are not
[1705.16 - 1711.28] mature they are in their development
[1707.88 - 1714.32] phase so the enzymes are attached to the
[1711.28 - 1717.68] protein a unique process that only
[1714.32 - 1719.88] happens in an egg there are a large
[1717.68 - 1722.40] amount of enzymes in a chicken egg
[1719.88 - 1725.32] because the chick has not formed yet so
[1722.40 - 1728.76] the proteins are unstable and the
[1725.32 - 1731.84] enzymes help keep the protein stabilized
[1728.76 - 1734.24] also the bugs feed off of hormones
[1731.84 - 1736.04] natural occurring hormones in the egg
[1734.24 - 1738.28] itself so if you're thinking hey wait a
[1736.04 - 1742.84] minute I'm safe I I could do my organic
[1738.28 - 1745.76] egg or I can do my backyard raised eggs
[1742.84 - 1749.52] but no the egg is a unique ball of
[1745.76 - 1752.08] hormones all eggs even organic eggs are
[1749.52 - 1753.96] so H what happens when you eat an egg
[1752.08 - 1755.52] let's go into that next how is it going
[1753.96 - 1757.60] to feed a virus like how's that even
[1755.52 - 1759.32] going to happen or a bacteria inside of
[1757.60 - 1763.44] you you chew the
[1759.32 - 1766.24] egg Yum Yum Yum you swallow it it enters
[1763.44 - 1770.92] your small intestinal tract if there's
[1766.24 - 1773.12] some hpy l in there right that HP Lori
[1770.92 - 1774.60] is going to have a field day it's going
[1773.12 - 1776.60] to have a picnic it's going to have a
[1774.60 - 1778.44] nice brunch if there's some strep to
[1776.60 - 1780.24] coctus in there you're thinking I don't
[1778.44 - 1783.72] have strep wa what's he even talking
[1780.24 - 1787.44] about this is ridiculous uh sibo H
[1783.72 - 1789.72] that's strepto coctus um UTI bladder
[1787.44 - 1793.88] infections yeast infections kidney
[1789.72 - 1796.60] infections chronic sinusitus um sty
[1793.88 - 1798.36] let's see the list goes on yeah people
[1796.60 - 1800.00] have strup tock this all in their system
[1798.36 - 1803.68] did you have strep throat a long time
[1800.00 - 1805.04] ago because it's still in us if you have
[1803.68 - 1807.60] a little bit of strep in your gut
[1805.04 - 1810.48] because everybody does you can be
[1807.60 - 1812.72] somebody with a small amount of bugs so
[1810.48 - 1815.88] it's a small Feeding Frenzy that goes on
[1812.72 - 1817.36] inside your gut and or inside your liver
[1815.88 - 1821.28] or inside your bloodstream or anywhere
[1817.36 - 1823.60] else eventually when the egg travels but
[1821.28 - 1825.92] you can be somebody though with a large
[1823.60 - 1827.84] Feeding Frenzy going on inside of you
[1825.92 - 1830.48] and you have a lot of symptoms and
[1827.84 - 1834.56] there's a lot going on with your health
[1830.48 - 1837.48] and the bugs get little bits of the egg
[1834.56 - 1839.64] the bacteria absorbs the egg through its
[1837.48 - 1841.00] membrane the outer membrane that
[1839.64 - 1843.64] protects the
[1841.00 - 1846.64] bacteria over time you start getting
[1843.64 - 1849.20] some bloating or digestive issues down
[1846.64 - 1851.40] the road and you land yourself a sibo
[1849.20 - 1854.96] diagnosis which most women are getting
[1851.40 - 1856.32] at this point in time and a lot of men a
[1854.96 - 1860.16] lot of men are getting that sibo
[1856.32 - 1862.52] diagnosis as the egg travels through
[1860.16 - 1866.88] your intestinal tract the egg is pretty
[1862.52 - 1869.24] much like a gluey Goo now it's being
[1866.88 - 1872.56] absorbed through the intestinal tract up
[1869.24 - 1875.28] into the hepatic portal vein heading to
[1872.56 - 1879.48] the liver so now the eggs traveling up
[1875.28 - 1882.20] to the liver inside everyone's liver are
[1879.48 - 1883.76] where most of the bugs are at plus
[1882.20 - 1885.96] toxins
[1883.76 - 1888.24] petrochemicals pesticides herbicides
[1885.96 - 1890.92] fungicides toxic Metals Mercury lead
[1888.24 - 1893.76] aluminum cadmium copper just list goes
[1890.92 - 1895.68] on the list goes on okay but there's
[1893.76 - 1897.20] bugs in there cuz bugs like being in
[1895.68 - 1901.48] there too cuz remember what I was
[1897.20 - 1905.20] telling you before Mercury feeds bugs
[1901.48 - 1907.88] just enough well the Private Industry
[1905.20 - 1911.32] the classified part figured that out
[1907.88 - 1913.12] long ago so our liver has that too in
[1911.32 - 1916.96] there so bugs like the bee in there they
[1913.12 - 1918.84] love that spot but that spot egg gets in
[1916.96 - 1921.16] there there too and that's where it's
[1918.84 - 1924.24] like more fun the eggs coming up into
[1921.16 - 1927.16] the liver here it comes and some people
[1924.24 - 1929.44] have more eggs going on inside the liver
[1927.16 - 1931.84] building up some people have more things
[1929.44 - 1934.84] in the liver but here's the thing some
[1931.84 - 1937.36] people have more bugs inside their liver
[1934.84 - 1939.56] that's where it gets a little sketchy
[1937.36 - 1941.60] like one Epstein bar two Epstein bar
[1939.56 - 1943.68] three Epstein bar like one potato two
[1941.60 - 1945.08] potato three potato they'll have all
[1943.68 - 1946.60] kinds of different bugs in there they'll
[1945.08 - 1948.40] have a Simplex in there if they've ever
[1946.60 - 1950.96] had a cold s in their life well that
[1948.40 - 1953.28] Simplex lives in the liver if they ever
[1950.96 - 1954.72] haded shingles or maybe they have
[1953.28 - 1958.00] shingles and don't know it because they
[1954.72 - 1961.44] have back pain or jaw pain trigeminal
[1958.00 - 1964.48] neuralgia or anything else going on but
[1961.44 - 1966.40] the point is these bugs are in the liver
[1964.48 - 1968.40] and that's where the party happens
[1966.40 - 1970.48] that's the camp out that's the
[1968.40 - 1972.88] campground that's the fair that's the
[1970.48 - 1975.52] county fair it's happening in the liver
[1972.88 - 1977.16] with all these bugs somebody will have a
[1975.52 - 1979.28] couple different varieties of bugs
[1977.16 - 1981.20] couple other different varieties of bugs
[1979.28 - 1983.04] and some people just might have one or
[1981.20 - 1985.60] two and they haven't really done much
[1983.04 - 1987.52] yet but as the immune system drops over
[1985.60 - 1989.84] time you're under stress your
[1987.52 - 1991.60] adrenaline's pumping life isn't easy
[1989.84 - 1993.92] you're not eating good you're eating
[1991.60 - 1995.48] more eggs than other Foods some other
[1993.92 - 1998.64] things are happening then that bug can
[1995.48 - 2002.32] grow and take advantage of that egg
[1998.64 - 2005.08] inside the liver and they love the liver
[2002.32 - 2008.96] because that's where most of the food is
[2005.08 - 2013.24] so as the eggs enter the liver another
[2008.96 - 2017.80] Feeding Frenzy occurs that gooey glue
[2013.24 - 2020.24] Trails up to that liver okay and the
[2017.80 - 2021.80] viruses they don't have a mouth so
[2020.24 - 2023.48] they're not eating like they're not
[2021.80 - 2024.84] sitting down at a dinner table and they
[2023.48 - 2026.84] got a fork and a knife and they're just
[2024.84 - 2029.16] eating their food like that I know so
[2026.84 - 2031.24] you know or they're not like an insect
[2029.16 - 2033.16] an insect that's eating somehow or
[2031.24 - 2036.28] drinking some kind of water off of a
[2033.16 - 2040.00] leaf you know somewhere that's not it at
[2036.28 - 2043.48] all viruses absorb Trace particles of
[2040.00 - 2045.88] the egg through their membranes and this
[2043.48 - 2048.16] is how science and research get the best
[2045.88 - 2051.16] of us they even get the best of the
[2048.16 - 2053.84] smartest people out there in health
[2051.16 - 2055.80] because we think about well viruses must
[2053.84 - 2058.64] have a mouth they must chew they must
[2055.80 - 2060.72] eat that can't happen it's impossible so
[2058.64 - 2065.28] viruses don't eat science of research
[2060.72 - 2068.16] knows that they can dumb us down by
[2065.28 - 2070.64] saying viruses don't eat you know
[2068.16 - 2072.88] because they can keep us like that
[2070.64 - 2074.28] because in our minds in people's minds
[2072.88 - 2076.68] cuz I talk to people all the time I talk
[2074.28 - 2078.24] to doctors and they're like viruses eat
[2076.68 - 2080.24] they're like what do they have a mouth
[2078.24 - 2082.28] they don't have a mouth they don't start
[2080.24 - 2084.12] chewing their food I've heard that from
[2082.28 - 2086.88] doctors and I'm not talking about
[2084.12 - 2091.28] inexperienced doctors either I'm talking
[2086.88 - 2093.68] about renowned experts in their field
[2091.28 - 2096.36] like the real thing like 30 years
[2093.68 - 2099.00] experience 40 years experience seeing
[2096.36 - 2101.24] all kinds of people droves coming into
[2099.00 - 2105.28] their offices for years they've studied
[2101.24 - 2107.68] in all different fields of medicine and
[2105.28 - 2111.12] they can easily get tricked by this one
[2107.68 - 2113.92] because human nature is to think
[2111.12 - 2116.16] that if something eats it's got to eat
[2113.92 - 2117.64] Chomp Chomp Chomp it's got to like eat
[2116.16 - 2121.00] something and that's where they get us
[2117.64 - 2123.24] in their grips the industry because we
[2121.00 - 2127.92] just instantly think an animal or an
[2123.24 - 2129.68] insect has a mouth and just eats and so
[2127.92 - 2132.20] what we need to know something about
[2129.68 - 2134.76] this is that viruses and bacteria not
[2132.20 - 2138.92] only eat but they
[2134.76 - 2141.20] eliminate poison so they excrete poison
[2138.92 - 2144.28] because what goes in has to come out
[2141.20 - 2147.56] it's like anybody that eats really right
[2144.28 - 2150.24] but viruses and pathogens absorb the
[2147.56 - 2153.96] food through their membrane and then
[2150.24 - 2157.32] release poisons and toxins through the
[2153.96 - 2160.92] membrane out so that's how it's done and
[2157.32 - 2163.52] this waste matter is highly toxic it
[2160.92 - 2166.64] builds up in the liver over time makes
[2163.52 - 2168.12] your liver stagnant sluggish and then
[2166.64 - 2171.08] you get the heart
[2168.12 - 2173.48] palpitations you get the weight starts
[2171.08 - 2176.20] coming on the hot flashes the night
[2173.48 - 2178.92] sweats you get a little bit of energy
[2176.20 - 2180.80] loss digestion system doesn't work good
[2178.92 - 2184.92] anymore all these different things
[2180.80 - 2186.92] happen the viruses feed off of the goo
[2184.92 - 2189.28] that's sitting inside the liver over
[2186.92 - 2192.92] time and then you're like wait a minute
[2189.28 - 2195.76] I exercise I take care of myself and
[2192.92 - 2197.64] wait I got this pound on me this extra
[2195.76 - 2200.68] pound when do I have an extra pound or
[2197.64 - 2203.16] two more why is weight coming on easier
[2200.68 - 2205.16] now like it doesn't make sense is it
[2203.16 - 2208.04] because I'm aging is it because I'm
[2205.16 - 2212.00] getting older and the pounds are coming
[2208.04 - 2213.68] on it makes somebody gain weight to
[2212.00 - 2216.40] people who feel like they would never
[2213.68 - 2218.40] gain a pound ever in their life and they
[2216.40 - 2221.16] start start gaining weight and some
[2218.40 - 2224.20] people gain that weight so early in life
[2221.16 - 2226.84] in their 20s and teens and it just
[2224.20 - 2228.96] happens because the liver gets maxed out
[2226.84 - 2231.92] easy and it gets filled up with all
[2228.96 - 2233.60] these toxins and bugs the very thing
[2231.92 - 2236.12] viruses and bacteria you guys know what
[2233.60 - 2240.40] I'm talking about and as each year goes
[2236.12 - 2243.44] by in your life in anyone's life a new
[2240.40 - 2246.68] symptom or condition can develop or an
[2243.44 - 2249.76] old symptom can come back and go and
[2246.68 - 2251.92] come back and next thing you know it
[2249.76 - 2254.88] your acne is back next thing you know it
[2251.92 - 2257.84] you have acne for the first time or
[2254.88 - 2260.80] eczema for the first time or psoriasis
[2257.84 - 2263.28] or like I said before like weight is
[2260.80 - 2266.96] gaining now and it's like why is the
[2263.28 - 2270.40] weight coming on and or migraines or
[2266.96 - 2271.68] floaters in the eyes or any kind of body
[2270.40 - 2274.96] pain
[2271.68 - 2277.24] fatigue and that's because the bugs are
[2274.96 - 2280.92] starting to live their life inside of
[2277.24 - 2282.92] our bodies and we're feeding these bugs
[2280.92 - 2285.48] as we're living our life as each year
[2282.92 - 2287.28] goes by but look look look the process
[2285.48 - 2289.16] of developing symptoms and conditions
[2287.28 - 2291.60] depends on a lot of factors I'm not
[2289.16 - 2294.92] saying eggs are the sole reason out
[2291.60 - 2297.52] there why everybody's sick it is one of
[2294.92 - 2300.20] the sole reasons of how viruses and
[2297.52 - 2303.48] bacteria started and were released into
[2300.20 - 2306.64] the world but there's all these other
[2303.48 - 2309.92] factors that allows the viruses to turn
[2306.64 - 2312.04] into a sickness and eating eggs yes
[2309.92 - 2314.12] that's one of them but there's other
[2312.04 - 2317.72] things too it depends on what bug
[2314.12 - 2320.56] somebody has is it aggressive is it
[2317.72 - 2323.88] severe what kind of strain is is it what
[2320.56 - 2326.20] kind of mutation is it what variety or
[2323.88 - 2327.88] how weaken somebody's immune system is
[2326.20 - 2330.28] it's important to keep our immune system
[2327.88 - 2333.56] strong you guys it's so important I talk
[2330.28 - 2336.80] about that for over 35 years but we
[2333.56 - 2339.36] weaken our immune systems because life
[2336.80 - 2341.72] is not easy here and it can happen to
[2339.36 - 2344.68] any of us at any time we go through
[2341.72 - 2348.52] emotional struggles that's a trigger we
[2344.68 - 2351.80] go through hardships we get exposed to
[2348.52 - 2354.20] pesticides and toxic heavy metals and
[2351.80 - 2357.64] herbicides and all kinds of other things
[2354.20 - 2360.68] too but it all depends on how many good
[2357.64 - 2363.16] things you're doing for yourself what
[2360.68 - 2365.80] tools are you using for yourself for
[2363.16 - 2368.32] example are you doing the celery juice
[2365.80 - 2371.48] because that's a tool to help clean up
[2368.32 - 2374.64] the mess to help clean up the liver get
[2371.48 - 2377.92] bugs out cuz the celery juice helps to
[2374.64 - 2379.88] kill off bugs by destroying the membrane
[2377.92 - 2383.08] that they use to even eat Foods they
[2379.88 - 2386.20] like like eggs see so while bugs are
[2383.08 - 2388.68] making mess inside of you all kinds of
[2386.20 - 2391.52] messes you're working on cleaning up the
[2388.68 - 2393.88] mess too at the same time so what tools
[2391.52 - 2395.92] are you using and then it falls into
[2393.88 - 2397.80] this whole thing check this out okay
[2395.92 - 2400.04] like you're doing a tool that's good for
[2397.80 - 2402.08] you you're using something that's good
[2400.04 - 2406.04] like celery juice but you're still
[2402.08 - 2409.84] eating eggs on your avocado toast see
[2406.04 - 2413.20] and yeah you can still get acne or maybe
[2409.84 - 2416.20] not acne as bad because your celery
[2413.20 - 2419.08] juice is keeping things at Bay so you
[2416.20 - 2421.28] can do things that are helping while
[2419.08 - 2423.16] you're doing things that are hurting
[2421.28 - 2425.44] look it's not your fault that you might
[2423.16 - 2429.48] be doing something that's hurting they
[2425.44 - 2433.00] ruined our eggs they did they destroyed
[2429.48 - 2435.24] our eggs made them a problem it's not
[2433.00 - 2437.60] like I got something against eggs and
[2435.24 - 2439.68] you're doing something terrible far from
[2437.60 - 2442.60] it you're trying to eat you're trying to
[2439.68 - 2444.96] survive trying to live your life and I'm
[2442.60 - 2447.48] trying to help you and trying to make
[2444.96 - 2450.20] sure you have the info so you can
[2447.48 - 2452.96] protect yourself so the industry doesn't
[2450.20 - 2455.52] win you know the darkness the darkness
[2452.96 - 2458.20] that the that's involved the game they
[2455.52 - 2460.64] play they created the bugs they made a
[2458.20 - 2463.24] world of sickness they make trillions of
[2460.64 - 2466.52] dollars as the years come and the
[2463.24 - 2468.56] centuries go by and you don't have to be
[2466.52 - 2472.32] a part of that entirely you be like you
[2468.56 - 2474.60] know what I can keep my eggs out but say
[2472.32 - 2476.56] you want to keep your eggs in what tools
[2474.60 - 2479.64] are you doing are you doing some celery
[2476.56 - 2484.88] juice are you eating good overall are
[2479.64 - 2486.96] you bringing in herbs wild foods are you
[2484.88 - 2488.44] building up your immune system
[2486.96 - 2492.44] do you know how to take care of yourself
[2488.44 - 2494.84] cleanse the liver everything matters but
[2492.44 - 2497.40] acne can sneak up on anybody when you're
[2494.84 - 2500.56] still doing things that can feed the
[2497.40 - 2501.52] bugs like eating the eggs this reminds
[2500.56 - 2504.40] me of
[2501.52 - 2506.68] cocaine like the binging out that
[2504.40 - 2508.32] happened well happens today people are
[2506.68 - 2511.28] on cocaine every day but it reminds me
[2508.32 - 2514.76] of the late 70s and early 80s and mid
[2511.28 - 2517.04] 80s there was this trend and and I've
[2514.76 - 2518.40] talked to a doctor about this and he was
[2517.04 - 2520.88] talking to me about it he said you know
[2518.40 - 2523.24] what's funny he goes this trend was
[2520.88 - 2524.68] crazy back then it was like happening he
[2523.24 - 2528.48] had patients come into the office that
[2524.68 - 2530.64] were cocaine addicts and um so what
[2528.48 - 2532.48] happened was people were snorting
[2530.64 - 2535.04] cocaine for 3 days straight they didn't
[2532.48 - 2537.88] eat anything they didn't drink anything
[2535.04 - 2539.36] like they do now but they weren't taking
[2537.88 - 2541.28] care of themselves of course you just go
[2539.36 - 2543.76] on a binge and you just stay awake you
[2541.28 - 2545.92] don't sleep a wink and you just do it
[2543.76 - 2550.36] for 3 days until you crash and you burn
[2545.92 - 2553.08] out you sleep and then you wake up and
[2550.36 - 2556.00] then you look around and you head to the
[2553.08 - 2559.04] health food store or to some store that
[2556.00 - 2560.88] sells a bottle of vitamin C doesn't
[2559.04 - 2563.88] matter junkiest stuff on the planet just

[2589.24 - 2596.40] you burn you go to sleep you wake up
[2593.48 - 2598.92] you're like what and then you're back at
[2596.40 - 2601.28] the store for more vitamin C that's what
[2598.92 - 2604.52] it was that's what it was about sound
[2601.28 - 2607.44] familiar you're eating pretty good no
[2604.52 - 2610.08] processed foods your ex exercizing no
[2607.44 - 2614.68] gluten you're staying hydrated drinking
[2610.08 - 2617.56] more water and you have a cheat day or a
[2614.68 - 2621.24] binge weekend and you're eating whatever
[2617.56 - 2622.84] and now comes Monday you're trying to
[2621.24 - 2625.12] work it out in the gym you're doing
[2622.84 - 2627.24] extra exercises you're drinking lots of
[2625.12 - 2628.60] water you're trying to flush your system
[2627.24 - 2631.52] you're trying to look into some kind of
[2628.60 - 2632.96] neat little trendy cleanse out there and
[2631.52 - 2634.20] you're gluten-free for a little bit
[2632.96 - 2636.36] longer you're staying away from the
[2634.20 - 2638.00] chocolate cake or some kind of cake and
[2636.36 - 2640.76] then you do it again and you have your
[2638.00 - 2644.64] cheat weekend again right but here's the
[2640.76 - 2645.64] difference with eggs you don't know it's
[2644.64 - 2647.96] a
[2645.64 - 2651.12] problem you have no
[2647.96 - 2654.00] idea nobody's going to tell you it's
[2651.12 - 2657.04] classified information you're hearing it
[2654.00 - 2659.08] for the first time in your life here on
[2657.04 - 2661.76] this podcast or unless you read the
[2659.08 - 2665.00] medical medium books
[2661.76 - 2668.56] so that's the difference what is the
[2665.00 - 2672.44] difference it's stealth it's classified
[2668.56 - 2676.04] it's there to mess your life up and you
[2672.44 - 2677.96] don't know it's bad so you're eating the
[2676.04 - 2680.04] eggs You Got the Whole Foods you got the
[2677.96 - 2682.48] eggs you got this good diet going on you
[2680.04 - 2684.72] got your egg on the avocado toast you
[2682.48 - 2686.92] got your egg your scrambled eggs in the
[2684.72 - 2688.52] morning without your toast because you
[2686.92 - 2690.68] don't want then the carbs so you're just
[2688.52 - 2693.44] doing plain old straight scrambled eggs
[2690.68 - 2695.32] with maybe a vegetable or an omelette
[2693.44 - 2697.72] right and you don't know it that the
[2695.32 - 2700.64] eggs are bad mad cuz the classified
[2697.72 - 2703.60] industry ruined them on you and no one
[2700.64 - 2706.28] told you and then you don't even get a
[2703.60 - 2708.96] choice like the cocaine addict does cuz
[2706.28 - 2711.64] the cocaine addict knows that cocaine is
[2708.96 - 2713.72] bad for them they know it they're not
[2711.64 - 2715.88] like oh this stuff is so good for me let
[2713.72 - 2718.52] me snort another line like this stuff is
[2715.88 - 2720.80] so good for me no they know it's bad
[2718.52 - 2723.36] they're just stuck in the addiction
[2720.80 - 2725.28] right but they get at least a chance
[2723.36 - 2727.60] when they wake up out of that addiction
[2725.28 - 2729.40] for a second to take care of themselves
[2727.60 - 2732.16] a little bit like maybe take some
[2729.40 - 2735.36] vitamin C but you don't get that chance
[2732.16 - 2738.44] so you can't even counter your egg
[2735.36 - 2741.12] addiction that nobody told you was a
[2738.44 - 2745.00] problem so you don't even get the choice
[2741.12 - 2747.32] unless you counter it by accident like
[2745.00 - 2750.16] you're doing your celery juice as a tool
[2747.32 - 2751.68] or you're eating good in other ways or
[2750.16 - 2754.16] you're taking care of yourself or you're
[2751.68 - 2756.48] getting a lot of sleep like whatever it
[2754.16 - 2759.32] is you're countering it
[2756.48 - 2764.04] and you're countering it by accident but
[2759.32 - 2767.16] you know the scoop now eaters lose all
[2764.04 - 2770.84] that's a scoop a classified industry
[2767.16 - 2774.32] took your egg used it raised all these
[2770.84 - 2778.88] pathogens created a world of sickness
[2774.32 - 2781.52] pain and suffering with your egg okay
[2778.88 - 2783.52] now you know like millions of other
[2781.52 - 2786.72] people know the truth from medical
[2783.52 - 2790.36] medium information that eggs are a
[2786.72 - 2792.84] problem now now you have the choice to
[2790.36 - 2794.88] do what a cocaine addict does take
[2792.84 - 2797.88] vitamin C in between binging but your
[2794.88 - 2799.80] choice is like hey I can actually do
[2797.88 - 2801.68] some more celery juice take care of
[2799.80 - 2804.56] myself better if I really want to keep
[2801.68 - 2808.92] my eggs around at least you have a
[2804.56 - 2812.00] choice but as time goes by and the eggs
[2808.92 - 2814.52] build up inside the liver and we have
[2812.00 - 2816.68] different relationships we spread more
[2814.52 - 2820.16] bugs around pass more bugs around we go
[2816.68 - 2821.96] into restaurants I've had people tell me
[2820.16 - 2823.88] that they find Band-Aids in their salads
[2821.96 - 2826.48] in some of the finest restaurants
[2823.88 - 2827.88] because chefs cut their fingers people
[2826.48 - 2830.24] who are working in the industry cut
[2827.88 - 2832.48] their fingers they got Band-Aids on and
[2830.24 - 2834.84] we collect more bugs we collect them
[2832.48 - 2837.36] from public bathrooms we collect them
[2834.84 - 2841.76] from all kinds of different ways so as
[2837.36 - 2845.36] time goes on the scale tips and it's not
[2841.76 - 2848.92] about juggling it anymore the scale tips
[2845.36 - 2852.64] all of sudden the bad outweighs the good
[2848.92 - 2854.36] it's not 5050 kind of ebing and flowing
[2852.64 - 2856.64] where you're getting a symptom here or a
[2854.36 - 2858.84] symptom there or you're feeling pretty
[2856.64 - 2860.08] good and all is well but you're kind of
[2858.84 - 2861.96] doing some good things for yourself
[2860.08 - 2863.84] you're gluten-free you might drink some
[2861.96 - 2867.36] celery juice you might try something
[2863.84 - 2869.48] else and no processed foods you're
[2867.36 - 2870.92] eating a few other good foods you're
[2869.48 - 2874.32] taking care of yourself getting more
[2870.92 - 2876.96] sleep but the scale tips we collect all
[2874.32 - 2879.68] these new bugs we we live our life we
[2876.96 - 2881.92] get more toxic our liver gets filled up
[2879.68 - 2885.88] with more poisons and toxins we collect
[2881.92 - 2888.96] more toxic heavy metals and then boom
[2885.88 - 2891.36] someone breaks up with us betrayal our
[2888.96 - 2894.44] adrenals are running we're in fight or
[2891.36 - 2896.36] flight our immune systems lowering we
[2894.44 - 2899.44] have some kind of relationship break up
[2896.36 - 2903.52] or a divorce somebody cheats on us or
[2899.44 - 2906.56] broken trust and that's there and the
[2903.52 - 2910.56] scale is tipping and the eggs are still
[2906.56 - 2913.48] in there they're still there and as more
[2910.56 - 2915.20] and more cheat days happen you can't
[2913.48 - 2918.96] kind of have your cheat days anymore
[2915.20 - 2921.84] like that's not an option you need to do
[2918.96 - 2924.52] more because as you're going through
[2921.84 - 2926.48] life the scale is so tipped you're
[2924.52 - 2930.04] starting to get a little bit of eczema
[2926.48 - 2932.40] now more bloating maybe your
[2930.04 - 2934.40] reproductive system isn't functioning
[2932.40 - 2936.76] quite like it should and you get a cyst
[2934.40 - 2940.52] for the first time in your life maybe
[2936.76 - 2943.84] hypothyroid maybe that happens and the
[2940.52 - 2947.36] scale gets tipped too far but if the
[2943.84 - 2949.72] eggs are still there you have a choice
[2947.36 - 2953.84] you can take them out you can get rid of
[2949.72 - 2956.56] them and at least Levy the playing field
[2953.84 - 2958.08] again bring in some more tools and you
[2956.56 - 2960.36] guys get the tools from the medical
[2958.08 - 2963.44] medium info so you can deal with your
[2960.36 - 2965.76] heart PPS your fatigue your anxiety and
[2963.44 - 2967.32] depression and your hair falling out and
[2965.76 - 2970.00] the bloating and the thyroid problems
[2967.32 - 2971.60] but what if what if here's somebody else
[2970.00 - 2973.84] the millions of people out there that
[2971.60 - 2976.08] don't have these tools and even know
[2973.84 - 2978.40] that the egg is not a good thing and
[2976.08 - 2980.68] it's not helping them they just start
[2978.40 - 2982.44] their doctor Journey it's always good to
[2980.68 - 2984.40] have a doctor of course and you have to
[2982.44 - 2986.48] have those doctors and there are a lot
[2984.40 - 2989.28] of doctors now using medical medium
[2986.48 - 2991.44] information and they they'll even say
[2989.28 - 2993.48] we're medical medium friendly Clinic we
[2991.44 - 2996.56] medical medium friendly doctor
[2993.48 - 2999.40] offices but the doctor journey is the
[2996.56 - 3002.88] thing that then millions of people go on
[2999.40 - 3005.32] they look for answers just like the
[3002.88 - 3008.40] millions of people that have done it
[3005.32 - 3012.44] before them over the last 70 years or
[3008.40 - 3015.36] more that got in trouble with their
[3012.44 - 3018.00] health because the classified Private
[3015.36 - 3020.92] Industry created the world of chronic
[3018.00 - 3023.40] illness and sickness and it's been a
[3020.92 - 3025.76] mess ever since so you're on this doctor

[3060.00 - 3065.36] cleanses on its own or something like
[3062.28 - 3068.60] that and then tells you to eat
[3065.36 - 3070.28] eggs you go to your chiropractor and

[3073.00 - 3076.28] your diet too something that never did
[3074.72 - 3079.48] in the past that's something that
[3076.28 - 3081.80] developed in the last 20 years and
[3079.48 - 3083.84] they'll tell you to go eat eggs you go
[3081.80 - 3085.56] to your acupuncturist your acupuncturist
[3083.84 - 3086.80] doesn't know what's wrong with you

[3086.80 - 3089.68] chronic illness and doesn't know why
[3088.68 - 3092.32] you're suffering from all these
[3089.68 - 3094.84] different symptoms but they'll tell you
[3092.32 - 3097.36] to eat eggs you talk to your health
[3094.84 - 3099.88] coach your trainer they don't know
[3097.36 - 3101.56] what's wrong with you but they'll tell
[3099.88 - 3104.52] you to go eat eggs as well and get
[3101.56 - 3108.40] plenty of protein and whether you're
[3104.52 - 3110.04] sick or you're not sick at all whether
[3108.40 - 3114.32] you're somebody who's just partially
[3110.04 - 3118.36] sick or you're not sick yet you get told
[3114.32 - 3120.56] to eat eggs look check this out okay
[3118.36 - 3123.00] public science and research medical
[3120.56 - 3124.84] science and research doesn't know why
[3123.00 - 3126.92] anybody's sick yet why do you think the
[3124.84 - 3128.36] theory of autoimmune is out there where
[3126.92 - 3130.36] they tell you your body's attacking
[3128.36 - 3133.04] itself which isn't true it's a theory
[3130.36 - 3135.56] was never proven and why do you think
[3133.04 - 3138.32] they say autoimmune is also cause
[3135.56 - 3141.40] unknown because science and research in
[3138.32 - 3146.00] the public Arena doesn't know why
[3141.40 - 3148.60] anyone's sick all right but classifi
[3146.00 - 3150.40] Private Industry that started the
[3148.60 - 3153.28] sickness the epidemic of the world
[3150.40 - 3156.04] sickness as we got today they know why
[3153.28 - 3159.16] you're sick the private classified
[3156.04 - 3161.76] industry they know why you're sick they
[3159.16 - 3163.60] started the whole mess they're the
[3161.76 - 3166.52] reason why the epidemic of chronic
[3163.60 - 3170.88] illness exists today they're the ones
[3166.52 - 3172.52] that created it but what's crazy is the
[3170.88 - 3174.12] public science of research and medical
[3172.52 - 3175.40] science of research all the experts and
[3174.12 - 3176.64] so forth they don't know why why
[3175.40 - 3179.16] anybody's sick they don't know why
[3176.64 - 3182.16] someone has eczema or lupus or what
[3179.16 - 3184.92] causes it and we can play that game all
[3182.16 - 3188.32] day long I think you get the picture
[3184.92 - 3190.48] though and a label is not the cause
[3188.32 - 3192.52] that's just to shut you up they still
[3190.48 - 3194.60] don't know why you're sick like with
[3192.52 - 3196.84] eczema it's like here's a cream good
[3194.60 - 3200.44] luck see you later that's what they'll
[3196.84 - 3202.32] say right and with everybody being such
[3200.44 - 3204.12] experts like the public science of
[3202.32 - 3205.84] research and medical science research
[3204.12 - 3208.04] all the medical community
[3205.84 - 3210.60] everybody thinking they're literally an
[3208.04 - 3213.36] expert in health science research
[3210.60 - 3215.72] studies all of it and what do they do
[3213.36 - 3218.52] when you get sick they tell you to eat
[3215.72 - 3221.52] eggs what about egg whites or home
[3218.52 - 3223.28] raised chicken eggs can you do those you
[3221.52 - 3226.72] know I got a friend who has a chicken
[3223.28 - 3228.84] shed and she lets out all the chickens
[3226.72 - 3231.56] and she tells me it's really healing and
[3228.84 - 3233.52] therapeutic they just go all squawking
[3231.56 - 3236.16] they go out they're pecking they're all
[3233.52 - 3237.88] out and about they're all over her yard
[3236.16 - 3240.40] she has a little fence going around the
[3237.88 - 3242.32] yard and she tells me Anthony they're
[3240.40 - 3245.52] eating insects they're eating seeds
[3242.32 - 3247.60] they're eating bugs they're eating grass
[3245.52 - 3249.36] they're eating leaves and she tells me
[3247.60 - 3252.24] all this stuff and then she'll throw her
[3249.36 - 3254.52] scraps that she has you know her
[3252.24 - 3256.08] vegetable scraps and she'll and her
[3254.52 - 3258.20] fruit scraps and she'll throw them out
[3256.08 - 3260.76] there and the chickens are all pecking
[3258.20 - 3264.52] through it she says it's the best thing
[3260.76 - 3265.68] ever but she's got neurological lime and
[3264.52 - 3267.76] she
[3265.68 - 3269.76] finally gave in she was like you know
[3267.76 - 3273.24] what I finally gave in I got the
[3269.76 - 3275.96] neurological lime I contacted you and
[3273.24 - 3279.56] you told me to get off the eggs and it
[3275.96 - 3282.52] broke her heart her heart was just
[3279.56 - 3285.36] broken from that and took a while to get
[3282.52 - 3287.52] past it now she just collects all the
[3285.36 - 3289.12] eggs which is still therapeutic and she
[3287.52 - 3292.00] gives them to her neighbor who has
[3289.12 - 3293.48] neurological lime but she gives them to
[3292.00 - 3295.24] her neighbor because her neighbor said
[3293.48 - 3297.00] she's not going to ever quit eggs she
[3295.24 - 3298.88] loves them and she's not going to give
[3297.00 - 3300.68] it up no matter what kind of Lyme
[3298.88 - 3302.28] disease symptoms She's suffering from so
[3300.68 - 3304.00] she brings them over to her neighbor cuz
[3302.28 - 3306.40] her neighbor's going to buy eggs anyway
[3304.00 - 3308.72] and these are the best eggs because they
[3306.40 - 3311.96] ruined our eggs it doesn't matter if
[3308.72 - 3314.84] they're organic or free range or
[3311.96 - 3318.24] homegrown or from the best place on the
[3314.84 - 3320.40] planet that was taken away from us no
[3318.24 - 3322.12] matter what that's the hard part about
[3320.40 - 3325.20] all of this because the eggs will still
[3322.12 - 3327.28] feed the bugs in our bodies that to
[3325.20 - 3329.52] create all of our sicknesses and I get
[3327.28 - 3331.16] it you might be somebody that's like you
[3329.52 - 3333.40] know what I don't have bugs I just got
[3331.16 - 3336.24] to like something's a little off like my
[3333.40 - 3338.92] microbiome or maybe my adrenals or
[3336.24 - 3341.48] hormones are off or my digestion is off
[3338.92 - 3343.44] or I'm allergic to gluten or something
[3341.48 - 3344.88] and I got a great practitioner or a
[3343.44 - 3346.52] doctor and they're just telling me these
[3344.88 - 3350.20] things I get it if you're in that place
[3346.52 - 3352.04] in life I totally respect that and but
[3350.20 - 3354.60] what happens though when you've seen
[3352.04 - 3356.44] your 10th doctor and you're losing the
[3354.60 - 3361.04] quality of of your life and the fatigue
[3356.44 - 3363.92] is so bad and your skin disorder is so
[3361.04 - 3366.08] hard on you and everything else then you
[3363.92 - 3368.20] just get to a point in your life after 5
[3366.08 - 3369.76] years of this or 10 years of this or
[3368.20 - 3372.52] maybe just a year of this where it's
[3369.76 - 3375.88] like okay what's wrong I need an answer
[3372.52 - 3378.24] because I've been there i' done that
[3375.88 - 3380.92] I've I've been around I'm
[3378.24 - 3383.20] seasoned what is the answer and then
[3380.92 - 3386.64] then it's like what okay wait a minute
[3383.20 - 3389.00] pathogens okay toxic heavy metals and
[3386.64 - 3391.28] what are the triggers because with
[3389.00 - 3394.40] people you can go down the road like
[3391.28 - 3396.40] everybody else and symptoms may come
[3394.40 - 3399.12] later you could be somebody that's
[3396.40 - 3401.24] exercising and you're not sick right now
[3399.12 - 3403.60] and all seems to be okay and then a
[3401.24 - 3406.00] divorce it's a crash and then your
[3403.60 - 3409.20] immune system crashes your adrenals are
[3406.00 - 3413.36] FL flooding or a bad breakup or you get
[3409.20 - 3415.64] cheated on or betrayal or a loss of a
[3413.36 - 3417.84] loved one or even
[3415.64 - 3419.92] childbirth that can lower the immune
[3417.84 - 3422.12] system I've talked about that before
[3419.92 - 3424.72] it's why so many moms get Hashimoto
[3422.12 - 3429.08] thyroiditis 3 months after they deliver
[3424.72 - 3432.48] a baby or they give birth and all these
[3429.08 - 3434.68] things can happen so heartache alone
[3432.48 - 3437.80] getting stabbed in the back is
[3434.68 - 3442.00] devastating surges that adrenaline
[3437.80 - 3446.04] lowers the immune system and the problem
[3442.00 - 3448.52] can develop months down the road and
[3446.04 - 3450.36] then there's other levels of stress too
[3448.52 - 3452.84] like a lot of levels of stress that we
[3450.36 - 3455.44] deal with and bugs can take ADV
[3452.84 - 3459.52] advantage of that when the immune system
[3455.44 - 3462.76] drops it's like when a woman gives birth
[3459.52 - 3466.12] her immune system is protecting the baby
[3462.76 - 3469.24] not the mom the baby and so because of
[3466.12 - 3471.08] that her immune system 50% of it during
[3469.24 - 3473.88] her pregnancy has been taking care of
[3471.08 - 3476.84] the child the other 50% is taking care
[3473.88 - 3480.20] of her but but things can happen because
[3476.84 - 3481.28] of that and then child birth itself it's
[3480.20 - 3484.56] over
[3481.28 - 3487.80] 90% of the immune system is taking care
[3484.56 - 3490.00] of the baby to protect the child and
[3487.80 - 3491.84] that's why if a mom has something going
[3490.00 - 3494.96] on then all of a sudden the fatigue
[3491.84 - 3497.08] happens the hair loss happens um
[3494.96 - 3500.00] anything can happen after child birth
[3497.08 - 3502.96] it's it's well known women develop a lot
[3500.00 - 3505.32] of symptoms that reoccur later including
[3502.96 - 3508.12] severe depression anxiety
[3505.32 - 3510.56] but what's not known is why all these
[3508.12 - 3512.60] symptoms happened after child birth and
[3510.56 - 3514.76] months later after child birth research
[3512.60 - 3518.04] and science doesn't know why any of that
[3514.76 - 3520.40] happened and what the causes are and
[3518.04 - 3522.48] because and they don't know also about
[3520.40 - 3525.56] the immune system dropping during
[3522.48 - 3528.40] pregnancy and when giving birth and that
[3525.56 - 3530.56] every little bit counts for support with
[3528.40 - 3532.76] the immune system when you're pregnant
[3530.56 - 3534.76] and after giving birth but they don't
[3532.76 - 3537.00] know that part so then it becomes a
[3534.76 - 3539.60] mystery it's like okay your thyroid
[3537.00 - 3542.76] problems your hypothyroidism your hair
[3539.60 - 3546.44] falling out your migraines your aches
[3542.76 - 3548.04] and pains your fatigue and all of it we
[3546.44 - 3552.04] don't know why it's happening you just
[3548.04 - 3553.68] got autoimmune or maybe it's genetic
[3552.04 - 3556.36] maybe it's genes and they just start
[3553.68 - 3558.84] going down that road and but they don't
[3556.36 - 3560.80] know also what to do to protect you
[3558.84 - 3562.40] instead it'll be the opposite and
[3560.80 - 3564.92] they'll say well you need to rebuild
[3562.40 - 3566.64] after that pregnancy you need to rebuild
[3564.92 - 3570.16] after giving birth you should be eating
[3566.64 - 3572.08] lots of eggs so keep the eggs in there
[3570.16 - 3574.20] and that's recommended to every pregnant
[3572.08 - 3576.16] woman who's either pregnant or after
[3574.20 - 3578.44] they give birth it's the first thing
[3576.16 - 3580.68] that every health professional does or
[3578.44 - 3582.16] the second thing or the third thing is
[3580.68 - 3585.92] what are you eating are you eating your
[3582.16 - 3588.28] eggs so and at the same time the immune
[3585.92 - 3590.48] system is dropping the eggs are feeding
[3588.28 - 3592.68] more bugs nobody knows that's why all of
[3590.48 - 3594.40] a sudden someone has chronic fatigue
[3592.68 - 3596.56] syndrome and then we're back to this
[3594.40 - 3599.64] whole whole thing of nobody knowing and
[3596.56 - 3602.00] it's really sad look I understand if
[3599.64 - 3604.76] someone can't let go of their eggs it's
[3602.00 - 3606.92] a survival food for a lot of people now
[3604.76 - 3608.72] I got people friends that' be like look
[3606.92 - 3612.96] you can help me with anything don't
[3608.72 - 3617.24] touch my eggs Don't Go Near them it's my
[3612.96 - 3619.76] lifeblood it's my religion don't touch
[3617.24 - 3621.56] it like I've heard that by from friends
[3619.76 - 3623.48] I've heard that from even professionals
[3621.56 - 3625.96] that have reached out doctors that reach
[3623.48 - 3628.16] out for help and they're like why am I
[3625.96 - 3630.40] sick aw and they'll be like look I want
[3628.16 - 3632.56] you to do this do this do this and then
[3630.40 - 3635.56] eggs and they're like what all a sudden
[3632.56 - 3640.12] eggs like no way you can't go there and
[3635.56 - 3642.96] I get it completely you know and try to
[3640.12 - 3644.52] be kind of open to somebody else too
[3642.96 - 3646.08] when you give this information out to
[3644.52 - 3648.32] them like when you tell them look stay
[3646.08 - 3650.40] away from eggs cuz you might get the
[3648.32 - 3651.96] same kind of flak you might get hit with
[3650.40 - 3653.64] the same kind of stuff keep a mind you
[3651.96 - 3656.96] know keep your mind open and also be
[3653.64 - 3659.24] cautious like tread carefully because
[3656.96 - 3662.64] you wouldn't believe the kind of trouble
[3659.24 - 3665.56] I get about the egg thing and wasn't
[3662.64 - 3667.68] even my fault I didn't ruin the eggs the
[3665.56 - 3670.60] industry did you guys know you know
[3667.68 - 3674.00] what's funny you know what's funny if no
[3670.60 - 3676.20] one knows why you're sick then how does
[3674.00 - 3679.36] anyone know eggs are actually good for
[3676.20 - 3682.20] you if no one knows how to keep us from
[3679.36 - 3684.20] getting sick then why are eggs so good
[3682.20 - 3685.76] for us there's all these anti-aging
[3684.20 - 3687.96] people people out there they like
[3685.76 - 3689.52] anti-aging live longer but they make
[3687.96 - 3692.08] sure that you're on this balanced diet
[3689.52 - 3694.24] and you got your eggs in that diet too
[3692.08 - 3696.12] but the eggs aren't going to keep you
[3694.24 - 3698.44] living longer when you got all these
[3696.12 - 3701.60] bugs making you sicker and giving you
[3698.44 - 3704.32] diseases and conditions including cancer
[3701.60 - 3706.84] and all kinds of other things so it's
[3704.32 - 3708.76] not one of those longevity Foods so
[3706.84 - 3711.08] let's talk about science the science end
[3708.76 - 3712.64] of things right in your mind you might
[3711.08 - 3714.68] be somebody that's like well what about
[3712.64 - 3717.80] the evidence that eggs are really
[3714.68 - 3720.92] healthy for us okay what about that well
[3717.80 - 3722.84] it's funny because paid for science
[3720.92 - 3726.24] talking about eggs being that good for
[3722.84 - 3728.36] us doesn't know why anybody's sick
[3726.24 - 3731.12] that's incredible right or how about
[3728.36 - 3733.36] this paid for Science and
[3731.12 - 3734.52] studies not only doesn't know why
[3733.36 - 3739.12] anybody's
[3734.52 - 3742.32] sick but doesn't know classified private
[3739.12 - 3745.88] evil industry from the past ruined the
[3742.32 - 3747.72] eggs raised all the bugs that is sick so
[3745.88 - 3750.48] here they are talking about protein
[3747.72 - 3752.20] Source number one protein Source there's
[3750.48 - 3754.88] nothing wrong with eggs at all they're
[3752.20 - 3757.68] the perfect food that's the consensus
[3754.88 - 3758.72] they got the Omega-3s they got vitamins
[3757.68 - 3762.92] they got
[3758.72 - 3765.40] nutrients and that's what they'll do and
[3762.92 - 3768.60] it's all paid for studies what you won't
[3765.40 - 3770.84] find you won't find a paid for study or
[3768.60 - 3772.72] a bunch of paid for studies that
[3770.84 - 3775.44] actually talk about why eggs are really
[3772.72 - 3778.48] not good for you and here's the other
[3775.44 - 3779.96] problem nobody knows in science land
[3778.48 - 3783.08] science and research land or medical
[3779.96 - 3786.68] science research land in public Arena
[3783.08 - 3789.84] not classified public Arena knows that
[3786.68 - 3792.00] those eggs will feed bugs so if that
[3789.84 - 3795.12] study ever happened on a public level it
[3792.00 - 3797.52] would be shut down faster than you could
[3795.12 - 3800.96] think it would a bomb would blow up in
[3797.52 - 3804.44] the place literally lab coats would be
[3800.96 - 3806.20] flying everywhere it would be a disaster
[3804.44 - 3809.20] that's what would happen if there was an
[3806.20 - 3811.32] actual study where they were discovering
[3809.20 - 3813.76] eggs actually feed the bugs keeping
[3811.32 - 3816.36] everybody sick and this stuff got out
[3813.76 - 3818.28] there forget it they don't want that
[3816.36 - 3821.32] chicken out of the chicken shed running
[3818.28 - 3823.64] down the street telling the truth about
[3821.32 - 3827.16] what they did to the eggs and why
[3823.64 - 3830.40] everybody's sick they'll never ever ever
[3827.16 - 3832.84] tell you that your bugs that are causing
[3830.40 - 3835.60] your sickness were because they raised
[3832.84 - 3837.92] them for decades in last abs and let
[3835.60 - 3839.92] them out they don't want that chicken
[3837.92 - 3844.16] out of the shed they don't want nobody
[3839.92 - 3846.88] knowing why you're sick they just don't
[3844.16 - 3849.20] and look they'll never tell you that the
[3846.88 - 3851.84] eggs you eat feed the bugs they raised
[3849.20 - 3854.52] in Labs no one will tell you it's the
[3851.84 - 3858.64] Wild Wild West when you get sick and
[3854.52 - 3860.88] that's how they love it they love that
[3858.64 - 3863.20] not the good people working for the good
[3860.88 - 3864.92] science of research and for the good
[3863.20 - 3866.40] meaning the good in pensions all the
[3864.92 - 3868.08] different health professionals that they
[3866.40 - 3870.32] got their heart in it and they want to
[3868.08 - 3873.32] heal people I'm not talking about that
[3870.32 - 3876.16] I'm talking about the classified Private
[3873.32 - 3879.20] Industry that started this epidemic of
[3876.16 - 3881.40] illness including what we're faced with
[3879.20 - 3882.92] today you're on your own when you get
[3881.40 - 3886.56] sick that's what
[3882.92 - 3889.72] happens and if you don't think so you'll
[3886.56 - 3892.20] realize that after you're fourth doctor
[3889.72 - 3893.64] that you're on your own and maybe you're
[3892.20 - 3895.52] someone that's not really sick or you
[3893.64 - 3898.84] got just a couple little symptoms and
[3895.52 - 3901.08] you're young and microbiome is an
[3898.84 - 3903.00] example of making you kind of like
[3901.08 - 3905.16] thinking well everything's good candida
[3903.00 - 3908.12] I could deal with that um a little bit
[3905.16 - 3911.84] of a hormone imbalance digestion is off
[3908.12 - 3914.40] a little bit but man when you get sick
[3911.84 - 3916.96] sick and that eczema is getting really
[3914.40 - 3919.72] bad and your fatigue is getting worse
[3916.96 - 3922.00] and your brain fogs taking over and you
[3919.72 - 3924.28] got these unexplainable symptoms and
[3922.00 - 3927.00] you're on your third neurologist and you
[3924.28 - 3929.32] did all the testing and spent all this
[3927.00 - 3933.40] money and you got this neurological
[3929.32 - 3936.40] fatigue your anxiety's crippling then
[3933.40 - 3939.48] you want answers and they're not going
[3936.40 - 3940.92] to tell you why everybody's sick and
[3939.48 - 3943.64] they're just going to tell you you
[3940.92 - 3946.28] should be eating your eggs of course no
[3943.64 - 3948.56] processed foods don't do processed foods
[3946.28 - 3951.60] you know but that's not enough that's
[3948.56 - 3953.80] not an answer and guess what plant-based
[3951.60 - 3955.12] is not enough either because I know it's
[3953.80 - 3957.64] some of you guys might be thinking that
[3955.12 - 3960.36] are plant-based like o I'm off the hook
[3957.64 - 3963.92] I'm off the hook man I don't eat eggs
[3960.36 - 3967.24] but the problem is plant basers always
[3963.92 - 3969.96] run back to eggs it's the first thing
[3967.24 - 3973.28] they run to when they get a symptom or
[3969.96 - 3975.80] they have a tooth problem cavity or an
[3973.28 - 3978.04] ache and a pain and then boom they're
[3975.80 - 3979.48] done with a plant-based diet they still
[3978.04 - 3981.68] keep some of to some of the tools that
[3979.48 - 3983.32] are in a plant-based diet like some of
[3981.68 - 3986.00] the philosophy that's in a plant-based
[3983.32 - 3988.68] diet the keep something but they'll
[3986.00 - 3990.80] bring eggs in as their first food or
[3988.68 - 3993.00] cheese they'll bring eggs or cheese
[3990.80 - 3995.68] they'll hit the dairy I get it I totally
[3993.00 - 3999.00] get it but being plant-based is not
[3995.68 - 4001.24] enough because there's also residue from
[3999.00 - 4003.36] years of eating eggs still inside the
[4001.24 - 4005.88] liver and if you're not cleansing or
[4003.36 - 4008.56] learning how to cleanse that out of your
[4005.88 - 4010.68] liver to begin with you can still get
[4008.56 - 4012.68] your first symptoms or your second
[4010.68 - 4015.28] symptoms or third symptoms or a new
[4012.68 - 4017.44] round of them while you're plant-based
[4015.28 - 4021.20] unless you know why you got sick to
[4017.44 - 4024.24] begin with paleo carnivore that's not an
[4021.20 - 4026.56] answer fod map food combining clean
[4024.24 - 4029.36] eating random supplements and no
[4026.56 - 4032.16] processed foods are not enough and
[4029.36 - 4034.48] they're not answers medical M
[4032.16 - 4037.36] information is about answers yes getting
[4034.48 - 4040.12] rid of eggs is one of the options one of
[4037.36 - 4044.40] the choices you can make that can really
[4040.12 - 4045.92] help and if you've been to 10 doctors
[4044.40 - 4048.56] you're still going to be told to eat
[4045.92 - 4051.28] eggs maybe your plant-based doctor might
[4048.56 - 4053.40] be like no no eggs plant-based is the
[4051.28 - 4056.28] way to go but I've seen plant-based
[4053.40 - 4059.20] doctors get sick for the first time or
[4056.28 - 4061.52] for the third time and something doesn't
[4059.20 - 4064.48] feel right and they're off eating eggs
[4061.52 - 4066.96] they actually go get eggs themselves
[4064.48 - 4070.36] many people on a plant-based diet start
[4066.96 - 4073.12] just eating eggs again and they won't
[4070.36 - 4075.36] rip eggs apart too bad it's so funny
[4073.12 - 4078.52] I've noticed in a plant-based movement
[4075.36 - 4081.56] that eggs are coveted they're actually
[4078.52 - 4083.72] coveted because you never know when
[4081.56 - 4086.88] you're going to need to run back to them
[4083.72 - 4089.48] so when the symptoms get the best of you
[4086.88 - 4094.20] the first animal product you run to is
[4089.48 - 4096.04] those eggs and hey look that's okay it's
[4094.20 - 4098.32] like you get a little scared and you're
[4096.04 - 4101.72] like oh my God maybe eggs are something
[4098.32 - 4104.32] I need when the crap hits the fan it's
[4101.72 - 4106.76] the first place you go it's one of those
[4104.32 - 4108.76] Foods in the back of your mind that you
[4106.76 - 4111.92] can lean on when things get
[4108.76 - 4114.24] uncomfortable there's a law about eggs
[4111.92 - 4116.76] you don't mess with them it's the best
[4114.24 - 4118.88] food on the planet for you hands down
[4116.76 - 4121.36] that's what everybody's told you know
[4118.88 - 4124.44] what's a sick joke they raise viruses in
[4121.36 - 4127.16] a lab on eggs the viruses cause
[4124.44 - 4130.00] reproductive system diseases in women
[4127.16 - 4132.12] and then you tell women to eat eggs for
[4130.00 - 4134.60] their health which keeps feeding their
[4132.12 - 4138.24] viruses and making the reproductive
[4134.60 - 4142.12] system conditions worse it's really
[4138.24 - 4144.52] really evil look let's face it no one's
[4142.12 - 4147.68] allowed to talk bad about eggs it hits
[4144.52 - 4149.84] the emotional core it's a comfort food
[4147.68 - 4151.96] and considered a health food people
[4149.84 - 4154.44] start putting their hardboiled eggs over
[4151.96 - 4157.36] easy poached eggs on their salads they
[4154.44 - 4160.16] make egg sandwiches and burritos avocado
[4157.36 - 4161.28] toast with eggs I see it all the time
[4160.16 - 4163.36] there's people out there and they're
[4161.28 - 4165.28] like making their avocado toast and then
[4163.36 - 4167.60] all of a sudden here comes a fried egg
[4165.28 - 4169.24] out of nowhere and it gets put on top
[4167.60 - 4171.56] it's like wait a minute wait wait you
[4169.24 - 4173.60] didn't have to do that oh what and then
[4171.56 - 4175.08] or scrambled eggs I see that too you got
[4173.60 - 4176.76] avocado toast going on and all of a
[4175.08 - 4180.20] sudden now there's a scrambled egg on
[4176.76 - 4183.64] top and problem is with that then the
[4180.20 - 4186.32] acne comes 3 months later or 2 months
[4183.64 - 4187.80] later and nobody knows why it's like
[4186.32 - 4190.84] wait a minute why am I getting a new
[4187.80 - 4195.00] bout of acne or why am I getting acne at
[4190.84 - 4197.64] all is it hormones no it's it's the eggs
[4195.00 - 4199.08] it was feeding something inside of you
[4197.64 - 4201.36] and you're not going to blame the eggs
[4199.08 - 4203.44] ever even if you knew the truth
[4201.36 - 4206.08] sometimes people still won't go there
[4203.44 - 4207.84] it's like okay I know the truth but
[4206.08 - 4210.40] there's no way I'm going there the
[4207.84 - 4212.76] classified industry loves how we love
[4210.40 - 4215.04] our eggs that's the first thing they
[4212.76 - 4218.36] also love how we don't know what they
[4215.04 - 4221.40] did to our eggs they want us to marry
[4218.36 - 4223.76] those eggs till death do us part that's
[4221.40 - 4226.88] what they want it's like an insurance
[4223.76 - 4230.12] policy to guarantee we all get sick
[4226.88 - 4232.68] someday they want our bugs to be fed did
[4230.12 - 4233.84] you hear that that was the plan and then
[4232.68 - 4236.24] sell
[4233.84 - 4239.16] Pharmaceuticals keep people sick for
[4236.24 - 4241.72] also other reasons too reasons that
[4239.16 - 4243.76] aren't so great and it feeds the
[4241.72 - 4246.48] industry and the industry's favorite
[4243.76 - 4249.32] thing of all is that not only do we not
[4246.48 - 4252.96] have a clue but we treat eggs like it's
[4249.32 - 4255.96] the air we breathe we never question it
[4252.96 - 4257.88] it's going to go on on forever and ever
[4255.96 - 4260.12] and ever did you ever see that movie
[4257.88 - 4262.36] Invasion of the Body Snatchers it's an
[4260.12 - 4264.72] old movie from many years ago they leave
[4262.36 - 4267.08] a pod by your bed that looks like a
[4264.72 - 4268.88] cabbage so when you get sleepy and
[4267.08 - 4271.64] you're ready to go to bed you're getting
[4268.88 - 4275.16] all comfy and you're tired and then you
[4271.64 - 4278.72] start falling asleep okay your body gets
[4275.16 - 4281.00] taken over by a replica of yourself but
[4278.72 - 4284.20] the difference is you end up mindless
[4281.00 - 4286.64] your body was snatched and you do as
[4284.20 - 4289.12] they say well this egg thing is kind of
[4286.64 - 4291.40] like that we mindlessly eat our eggs and
[4289.12 - 4293.12] we shut up about them okay don't say
[4291.40 - 4295.16] nothing bad because you'll get your
[4293.12 - 4296.80] grandpa upset especially if he's making
[4295.16 - 4299.88] his eggs in the morning he's going to
[4296.80 - 4302.36] start yelling trust me he will you'll
[4299.88 - 4304.84] get your mom upset too she'll start
[4302.36 - 4306.84] yelling look it happened to me I was 7
[4304.84 - 4308.92] years old Spirit of compassion said you
[4306.84 - 4310.36] know hold off those eggs and I was like
[4308.92 - 4314.04] well I don't want to have that this
[4310.36 - 4316.20] morning she was like what and it just
[4314.04 - 4318.60] went out of control look you'll get your
[4316.20 - 4321.84] best friend upset I got a friend who
[4318.60 - 4324.36] yelled at another friend and freaked out
[4321.84 - 4327.00] because the other friend didn't want any
[4324.36 - 4329.00] eggs I mean and then or you'll just get
[4327.00 - 4331.08] this whole thing where somebody be like
[4329.00 - 4333.40] what do you mean you don't like eggs
[4331.08 - 4334.76] everybody likes eggs uh you got allergic
[4333.40 - 4337.04] are you allergic to eggs or you got an
[4334.76 - 4340.32] allergy or something people just freak
[4337.04 - 4343.96] out cuz they've all been body snatched
[4340.32 - 4346.60] even our families they're taking over by
[4343.96 - 4349.68] the body snatcher pod and you're the
[4346.60 - 4352.52] only one left but if you complain and
[4349.68 - 4354.60] say you don't want your eggs and you
[4352.52 - 4357.84] tell them that those eggs are bad for
[4354.60 - 4360.40] you then they'll leave a pod by your bed
[4357.84 - 4362.24] and you'll get snatched you'll eat the
[4360.40 - 4366.48] eggs for the rest of your life and
[4362.24 - 4368.76] you'll be eating eggs all the time look
[4366.48 - 4370.92] I get it no one wants to know they got
[4368.76 - 4372.60] bugs in them no one wants to know that
[4370.92 - 4374.96] they're feeding their bugs with their
[4372.60 - 4376.84] favorite food when you think about that
[4374.96 - 4378.64] it's really annoying it's like okay wait
[4376.84 - 4381.24] a minute here that's my favorite comfort
[4378.64 - 4382.60] food or that's my favorite food but I
[4381.24 - 4384.32] don't tell everybody it's my favorite
[4382.60 - 4386.60] food cuz some people be like I don't
[4384.32 - 4388.88] really like eggs yeah they do when you
[4386.60 - 4390.68] learn the truth about eggs that's
[4388.88 - 4394.00] already helped millions of people
[4390.68 - 4397.56] worldwide the medical medium information
[4394.00 - 4400.32] people who were so sick and they needed
[4397.56 - 4402.72] every Advantage they could get and it
[4400.32 - 4405.84] counts when you're really sick and when
[4402.72 - 4408.96] they rid the eggs from their diet it
[4405.84 - 4412.16] changed their lives it gave them that
[4408.96 - 4414.84] edge see I get it if you're not that
[4412.16 - 4416.64] sick no one wants to know you got a bug
[4414.84 - 4418.72] and no one wants to know you're feeding
[4416.64 - 4421.48] your bugs especially if it's your
[4418.72 - 4424.12] favorite food you'd rather think maybe
[4421.48 - 4426.80] my hormones are off or adrenals are a
[4424.12 - 4431.04] little bit problematic or my gut balance
[4426.80 - 4432.80] is off or poor digestion or leaky gut or
[4431.04 - 4436.52] got autoimmune or something but if you
[4432.80 - 4439.84] get sick enough and it finally hits you
[4436.52 - 4443.56] something's wrong and we need to get it
[4439.84 - 4446.24] better getting rid of eggs is a good
[4443.56 - 4449.60] start a really good
[4446.24 - 4453.08] start they took a survival food the
[4449.60 - 4455.84] innocent egg that we relied upon
[4453.08 - 4460.04] utilized and needed for hundreds of
[4455.84 - 4462.76] years and turn this food the egg against
[4460.04 - 4465.52] us without our permission taking
[4462.76 - 4469.56] something precious and meaningful that
[4465.52 - 4472.28] was ours and weaponized it and raised
[4469.56 - 4475.56] the very pathogens that are responsible
[4472.28 - 4478.20] for sickness today without us knowing
[4475.56 - 4481.08] without us seeing and without us getting
[4478.20 - 4484.64] a chance to stand up for ourselves and
[4481.08 - 4487.56] make a choice to protect our egg and be
[4484.64 - 4490.80] able to decide for ourselves what is
[4487.56 - 4493.48] right as we walk our path we want things
[4490.80 - 4496.04] to be as they are not something else
[4493.48 - 4499.04] that we know nothing about there's a
[4496.04 - 4501.80] feeling that overcomes us all every time
[4499.04 - 4504.20] we're in a store you remember it right
[4501.80 - 4506.44] as you're grabbing a dozen eggs or more
[4504.20 - 4509.24] there's an emotional attachment as we
[4506.44 - 4511.76] open the carton hatch an automatic
[4509.24 - 4514.52] button in us to make sure each one is
[4511.76 - 4516.96] perfect and not one of them is cracked
[4514.52 - 4519.56] we learn this from the beginning of our
[4516.96 - 4521.72] life it's part of a deep emotional
[4519.56 - 4524.20] connection before we're taught to
[4521.72 - 4526.92] scramble or fry
[4524.20 - 4529.76] they took a legendary food from us
[4526.92 - 4532.68] surrounded by life-saving Glory they
[4529.76 - 4535.76] snatched it away from us all and created
[4532.68 - 4537.84] a forever lasting gory leading to
[4535.76 - 4540.48] sickness of millions of people but
[4537.84 - 4543.00] you're not supposed to know that story
[4540.48 - 4546.04] the egg was used to take the breath away
[4543.00 - 4549.00] of so many who did no wrong it caused a
[4546.04 - 4551.60] historical neurological problem and some
[4549.00 - 4554.40] ended up in the iron lung as the
[4551.60 - 4556.64] innocent people stared at at the mirror
[4554.40 - 4559.68] they couldn't go anywhere they were
[4556.64 - 4562.44] filled with Terror they no longer could
[4559.68 - 4564.64] look up and see the church St unless
[4562.44 - 4565.36] they were looking down at the floor in
[4564.64 - 4568.80] the
[4565.36 - 4572.48] mirror how did this happen and what was
[4568.80 - 4575.84] the way the truth is that men in the lab
[4572.48 - 4579.04] coats opened the egg research and
[4575.84 - 4582.92] science turned against this overnight in
[4579.04 - 4586.04] just one day what does it matter and
[4582.92 - 4588.60] there eyes it was six of one half dozen
[4586.04 - 4590.76] of the other and who cared if each of
[4588.60 - 4593.76] the eggs they opened up were from a
[4590.76 - 4597.88] different hand mother what they did to
[4593.76 - 4600.56] us and our eggs is surreal shows us once
[4597.88 - 4603.76] again that the spiritual war both around
[4600.56 - 4606.64] us and above us is real and that
[4603.76 - 4609.88] Darkness runs man and the industries and
[4606.64 - 4612.60] tries to decide how we receive our pain
[4609.88 - 4615.24] and our suffering but this doesn't have
[4612.60 - 4618.08] to be our Our Fate we have our own free
[4615.24 - 4620.80] will to take control over our health and
[4618.08 - 4623.40] not throw it all away because they know
[4620.80 - 4626.16] nothing we can make our own decisions
[4623.40 - 4629.28] and choices as we learn how to overcome
[4626.16 - 4632.76] and beat them at their own game and as
[4629.28 - 4636.24] we battle Darkness on our own terms not
[4632.76 - 4639.00] their terms they're not the same using
[4636.24 - 4642.52] the tools and the knowledge and the
[4639.00 - 4643.56] inside truth from way above we can see
[4642.52 - 4646.40] the light
[4643.56 - 4648.32] and decide our own outcome that can make
