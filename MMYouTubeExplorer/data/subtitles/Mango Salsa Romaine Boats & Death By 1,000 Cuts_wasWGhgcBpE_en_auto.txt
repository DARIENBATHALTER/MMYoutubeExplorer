[155.28 - 159.04] guys are coming on
[156.72 - 160.16] this is great i'm anthony i went to the
[159.04 - 162.40] doctor yesterday and
[160.16 - 163.36] asked for half vials and the doctor
[162.40 - 166.16] looked at me
[163.36 - 167.12] and said we don't do half [ __ ] but yet
[166.16 - 169.12] but yet
[167.12 - 170.32] you know what's crazy austin is there's
[169.12 - 172.08] a lot of people saying they're asking
[170.32 - 174.72] their doctors can can you do half
[172.08 - 176.32] vials and they're saying no problem and
[174.72 - 177.60] a lot of phlebotomists now are saying
[176.32 - 179.44] hey no problem
[177.60 - 181.44] and it's really difficult when they do
[179.44 - 182.64] that because yeah of course you can do
[181.44 - 184.72] half files right
[182.64 - 186.72] of course there's the half files out
[184.72 - 189.04] there of course in
[186.72 - 189.76] because if anybody just got on here
[189.04 - 192.48] right
[189.76 - 194.48] this you know this episode that the
[192.48 - 195.92] episode is medical mean podcast at apple
[194.48 - 198.72] podcast i talk about blood draw
[195.92 - 201.36] bloodletting and vampirism and
[198.72 - 202.40] i talk about too much blood is taken
[201.36 - 206.72] which you lose
[202.40 - 210.56] your cbc cbc you were good to me
[206.72 - 211.60] but now bye bye bb see you later cbc
[210.56 - 213.04] gone gone
[211.60 - 215.12] and that's what they do they remove
[213.04 - 219.12] remove remove they remove
[215.12 - 221.44] um and and when they remove
[219.12 - 222.72] you're you're losing that immune system
[221.44 - 224.00] a little bit a little bit a little bit a
[222.72 - 225.36] little bit and then a lot more of it a
[224.00 - 226.64] lot more of it and the bone marrow has
[225.36 - 229.92] to kill itself
[226.64 - 233.20] to actually try to restore and recreate
[229.92 - 235.84] and recreate um uh
[233.20 - 237.84] the you know recreate the immune system
[235.84 - 241.28] and then we get in trouble
[237.84 - 242.72] so the bottom line is um you know
[241.28 - 244.16] i in the episode if you guys want to
[242.72 - 245.44] know i talk about how you ask your
[244.16 - 247.28] doctor for half files ask your
[245.44 - 249.68] phlebotomist do have files
[247.28 - 251.60] the lab will take quarter vials we've
[249.68 - 254.16] had rns on instagram
[251.60 - 255.12] come on and say that yeah we take
[254.16 - 256.88] quarter vials
[255.12 - 258.32] at our lab you know we'll take half
[256.88 - 260.48] files um
[258.32 - 261.68] so yeah it's really important to know
[260.48 - 265.28] the stuff uh
[261.68 - 268.24] so we're making mango salsa remain boats
[265.28 - 270.48] all right and we're talking about what
[268.24 - 272.16] you know austin asked for half files
[270.48 - 273.84] it's it's not easy you know it's not
[272.16 - 277.12] easy when that happens i i've
[273.84 - 277.76] i've deborah hi anthony not feeling my
[277.12 - 279.44] best today
[277.76 - 280.80] so if the doctor doesn't take look if
[279.44 - 282.08] it's if it was me right
[280.80 - 283.44] listen to your doctor always listen to
[282.08 - 283.92] your doctor all you guys but if it was
[283.44 - 286.56] me
[283.92 - 288.00] like me what i would do is be like okay
[286.56 - 288.88] well you take full vials you don't take
[288.00 - 290.88] half files
[288.88 - 292.72] all right well then you know i'm gonna
[290.88 - 296.08] give you two to three vials
[292.72 - 298.00] that's what i would do um i'll give you
[296.08 - 300.56] two to three vials if you only take full
[298.00 - 303.76] vials i'll give you two full vials
[300.56 - 305.84] uh three full vials the most um
[303.76 - 307.20] listen to the podcast and all that for
[305.84 - 309.04] sure
[307.20 - 311.36] deborah hi anthony not feeling my best
[309.04 - 314.88] today oh no
[311.36 - 317.52] no you know i mean that's not good
[314.88 - 317.52] that's not good
[317.84 - 327.28] deborah you having one of those days
[322.84 - 330.00] yeah yeah you know it's three steps up
[327.28 - 330.80] two steps back down right so three steps
[330.00 - 334.08] up
[330.80 - 337.20] and then two steps back down right
[334.08 - 338.00] but what happens is when you start
[337.20 - 340.32] feeling a little better
[338.00 - 341.44] on your three steps up you start doing
[340.32 - 343.84] more
[341.44 - 344.80] and what spirit of compassion has always
[343.84 - 346.32] told me is when
[344.80 - 348.32] and then people start doing a little bit
[346.32 - 350.72] more than they normally do but they
[348.32 - 352.56] but but you know it's hard to tell but
[350.72 - 353.92] you do a little bit more and
[352.56 - 356.00] then you feel like you get kicked back
[353.92 - 357.68] down again and
[356.00 - 359.52] but then you're down again down again
[357.68 - 361.44] for a little bit and then you go back up
[359.52 - 362.80] but then you go back up a step a little
[361.44 - 364.88] higher
[362.80 - 366.00] and you know and there's this process
[364.88 - 369.04] you're climbing a slaughter you're
[366.00 - 371.60] three steps up two steps back
[369.04 - 373.36] right three steps up and that's how
[371.60 - 374.64] healing works in the body and there's
[373.36 - 377.36] nothing more
[374.64 - 377.76] there's nothing more you know as far as
[377.36 - 380.48] like
[377.76 - 381.92] feels disappointing when you feel like
[380.48 - 384.16] you're going back a little bit
[381.92 - 386.00] or you're having one of those days or a
[384.16 - 387.12] few days where you're like i just don't
[386.00 - 389.68] feel good
[387.12 - 391.12] you know i don't feel good and it's
[389.68 - 394.00] really hard endeavor just
[391.12 - 394.40] just hang in there hang in there because
[394.00 - 395.60] when
[394.40 - 397.20] when you're when you're when you're
[395.60 - 398.40] working on your healing process your
[397.20 - 400.80] body loves you
[398.40 - 403.28] it loves you unconditionally it knows
[400.80 - 403.92] you're working with it our bodies know
[403.28 - 407.12] their
[403.92 - 409.20] our bodies know that we're working as a
[407.12 - 411.12] team with our body and our body loves us
[409.20 - 414.72] for it and is looking out for us
[411.12 - 414.72] so just hang in there okay
[415.04 - 420.24] um anthony how do we take the shots
[418.80 - 423.44] let's talk about it
[420.24 - 425.84] um so here's what i do okay
[423.44 - 427.76] i mean in the morning if if i don't get
[425.84 - 429.84] my celery juice done yet
[427.76 - 430.88] you know i mean it happens things are
[429.84 - 432.72] going crazy
[430.88 - 434.80] because the celery juice is a powerful
[432.72 - 437.60] healing tool we know that right
[434.80 - 439.36] but i'm using for my friends and family
[437.60 - 440.88] the wild blueberry juice is a powerful
[439.36 - 443.04] tool too so it's one you know it's one
[440.88 - 445.92] of those things i just love tools
[443.04 - 446.32] you know and it matters so what i do is
[445.92 - 448.40] um
[446.32 - 449.60] in the morning if if for some reason i
[448.40 - 452.88] didn't have my
[449.60 - 453.60] celery juice yet right and i'm in a
[452.88 - 458.00] place where
[453.60 - 459.36] um where the the morning's coming on
[458.00 - 460.80] it's getting late you know it's getting
[459.36 - 461.76] late in the morning late in the day and
[460.80 - 463.76] i'm like whoa
[461.76 - 466.08] or lately we're late morning now i'll
[463.76 - 469.04] make sure i get a couple of shots in
[466.08 - 470.16] um sometimes i'll do them early in the
[469.04 - 473.76] morning too
[470.16 - 475.52] right so what i do is
[473.76 - 478.00] i actually get in touch with the energy
[475.52 - 480.40] here with what's in here so that's how
[478.00 - 481.28] i do it right and i didn't tell you guys
[480.40 - 484.80] because
[481.28 - 485.20] um i had i i've had moments in my life
[484.80 - 489.36] right
[485.20 - 492.80] that i've been blessed to sit in a wild
[489.36 - 495.36] blueberry field and it's something that
[492.80 - 496.08] i can't even tell you right because the
[495.36 - 498.56] plants are
[496.08 - 499.68] thousands of years old and thousands of
[498.56 - 501.60] years old
[499.68 - 503.12] and they've been doing their thing every
[501.60 - 505.12] single year they come up out of the
[503.12 - 505.76] ground you can't kill these things
[505.12 - 507.92] they're
[505.76 - 510.32] they're so potent and powerful in my
[507.92 - 511.20] opinion it's like adaptogenic times 10
[510.32 - 514.32] right
[511.20 - 516.72] and so i've had the experience of
[514.32 - 518.16] knowing what it's like to cut to lay in
[516.72 - 520.96] the field and meditate
[518.16 - 521.68] to meditate in wild blueberry fields
[520.96 - 524.40] where i'm just
[521.68 - 525.36] laying in them and you can feel the
[524.40 - 527.20] energy you've got
[525.36 - 528.96] the earth and the blueberries are all
[527.20 - 530.88] around you and they're coming up
[528.96 - 532.08] around your arms and it's it's
[530.88 - 535.28] incredible yeah you turn
[532.08 - 537.20] blue and you got to pick the clothes you
[535.28 - 537.92] want to wear that day if you do it
[537.20 - 540.08] because
[537.92 - 541.92] those things are going to be blue
[540.08 - 543.76] they're just going to be blue right
[541.92 - 545.76] and uh because you're laying on those
[543.76 - 546.16] berries you're crushing those berries
[545.76 - 548.48] right
[546.16 - 550.08] and i've been there and you don't have
[548.48 - 553.12] to have that experience right
[550.08 - 554.96] because it's in the bottle
[553.12 - 556.96] what we're not that's how i think about
[554.96 - 559.36] it you know it's in the bottle
[556.96 - 560.16] and so i do this little meditation
[559.36 - 562.56] around
[560.16 - 563.36] um the wild blueberry juice is what i do
[562.56 - 566.08] and it's
[563.36 - 567.12] i sit i sit quietly for a moment right
[566.08 - 570.24] and you can lay down
[567.12 - 572.24] too but i sit quietly in a spot and i
[570.24 - 573.76] close my eyes or i'll lean back in a
[572.24 - 577.20] nice comfy chair
[573.76 - 578.48] um or lay down on the floor or on the
[577.20 - 581.20] couch or something
[578.48 - 583.20] and i'll think about the power these
[581.20 - 584.88] wild blueberry plants have being around
[583.20 - 588.08] for thousands of years and
[584.88 - 589.20] how they feed all the animals they feed
[588.08 - 593.36] the deer
[589.20 - 596.00] they feed the moose they feed the bears
[593.36 - 598.00] they feed the foxes right and i think
[596.00 - 600.08] about all that and i think about
[598.00 - 601.84] like all the hungry animals that when
[600.08 - 603.04] these blueberries start coming up these
[601.84 - 604.80] wild blueberries this isn't
[603.04 - 606.24] this isn't cultivated blueberry the wild
[604.80 - 609.20] blueberries when they're coming up
[606.24 - 610.96] in the fields i think about the foxes
[609.20 - 612.72] going through the field right
[610.96 - 614.56] and they're hungry because it's not easy
[612.72 - 615.76] to get food for for wild animals it's
[614.56 - 618.00] not easy at all
[615.76 - 619.44] the foxes will just sit in the field and
[618.00 - 621.20] they'll eat and i'll remember this and
[619.44 - 622.80] i'll be thinking about this right
[621.20 - 625.36] and if you haven't experienced it it's
[622.80 - 628.48] okay you can just think about it and
[625.36 - 630.40] and so what happens is that um that's
[628.48 - 632.80] how i get in touch
[630.40 - 634.16] with the wild blueberry the energy of it
[632.80 - 636.88] and that's part of
[634.16 - 637.44] how i take the shots okay uh which is
[636.88 - 638.88] really
[637.44 - 641.04] really big part of it so then of course
[638.88 - 644.16] i open up the bottle
[641.04 - 647.68] right and i think about the color
[644.16 - 650.40] and i'm there's you can't juice
[647.68 - 651.36] a cultivated blueberry and get that
[650.40 - 653.60] color
[651.36 - 655.44] it's not gonna happen you know and from
[653.60 - 656.88] what i've seen in my opinion and what
[655.44 - 657.44] i've seen and what i believe because
[656.88 - 660.16] i've
[657.44 - 662.40] juiced myself so like regular cultivated
[660.16 - 664.80] blueberries have juiced everything right
[662.40 - 665.68] and so i think about the color and
[664.80 - 669.36] where's that what
[665.68 - 672.00] what is that color like what that's
[669.36 - 672.56] the power color right that's what that
[672.00 - 675.92] is
[672.56 - 678.64] so i connect like my mind and body
[675.92 - 679.60] to what the reality is of what i'm
[678.64 - 681.52] seeing
[679.60 - 683.36] so that my immune system so everything
[681.52 - 685.52] in my body is starting to like
[683.36 - 686.40] resonate to be like whoa are we gonna
[685.52 - 688.72] receive
[686.40 - 690.48] that color those pigments like are we
[688.72 - 692.88] going to receive those pigments
[690.48 - 694.40] so that's what i do you guys can do
[692.88 - 694.80] something different if you like and you
[694.40 - 696.64] can do
[694.80 - 698.48] any you don't have to do any of this you
[696.64 - 701.44] can just take your shot
[698.48 - 702.24] but i'm just saying so and then i pour
[701.44 - 704.88] the shot
[702.24 - 707.20] with all of this in mind so i connect my
[704.88 - 710.24] body to what this really is
[707.20 - 712.48] and you know and i and i really kind of
[710.24 - 713.44] sing a blessing is what i do because i'm
[712.48 - 716.08] like well
[713.44 - 716.88] you know how how is it possible when i
[716.08 - 718.40] was younger
[716.88 - 720.16] and i think about those blueberries in
[718.40 - 723.68] the field that they're so
[720.16 - 726.32] hard to harvest and to
[723.68 - 726.88] bring to a market as it is never mind
[726.32 - 728.96] actually
[726.88 - 730.24] having that juice and this is all part
[728.96 - 732.48] of how i take the shots you know and
[730.24 - 732.48] then i
[734.08 - 738.16] send it down like a tequila but i've
[736.88 - 742.48] never had tequila
[738.16 - 742.88] so anyway as i do a shot every single
[742.48 - 745.04] day
[742.88 - 746.40] some days i'll take two shots and there
[745.04 - 746.96] are days where i take three shots and
[746.40 - 750.08] i'm like
[746.96 - 750.08] you know but because
[753.52 - 760.08] huh hello
[756.72 - 763.76] what's going on huh
[760.08 - 766.88] um how come wyman's isn't organic
[763.76 - 768.08] do they use pesticides so i can answer
[766.88 - 771.36] that
[768.08 - 772.88] okay so wyman's is a wild food it's a
[771.36 - 776.40] wild food
[772.88 - 778.00] and so wild blueberries they take care
[776.40 - 781.12] of themselves
[778.00 - 782.24] for almost all of of what they need they
[781.12 - 786.80] take care of themselves
[782.24 - 789.12] and a cultivated blueberry you have to
[786.80 - 791.04] whether it's organic a cultivated
[789.12 - 793.28] blueberry whether it's organic
[791.04 - 794.16] or it's conventional it has to be
[793.28 - 797.44] sprayed
[794.16 - 799.60] three times a week so the organic water
[797.44 - 802.64] the organic blueberries
[799.60 - 804.72] they have to be sprayed the organic
[802.64 - 806.08] the cultivated organic blueberries have
[804.72 - 808.80] to be sprayed spray spray
[806.08 - 810.08] the cultivated blueberry whether it's
[808.80 - 812.88] conventional
[810.08 - 815.52] it has to be sprayed spray spray right
[812.88 - 816.48] so and the thing is with sprays and you
[815.52 - 818.64] have to realize
[816.48 - 820.64] that sprays are a catch-22 so the
[818.64 - 822.16] organic sprays are a catch-22 and i
[820.64 - 824.24] talked about
[822.16 - 826.24] how what's in those things but what
[824.24 - 827.76] wyman's does is because the crops take
[826.24 - 830.32] care of themselves
[827.76 - 832.08] they can pick and choose where they they
[830.32 - 833.04] spray and they don't use pollinator
[832.08 - 836.08] killers
[833.04 - 838.48] and so it's only a part of a crop
[836.08 - 840.08] certain time of year or one year and a
[838.48 - 841.28] year to go by and they don't do it all
[840.08 - 842.64] another year could go by and they don't
[841.28 - 844.56] don't do it all
[842.64 - 845.84] and they're barry's got the zero
[844.56 - 847.60] pesticide residue
[845.84 - 849.20] because of this because a wild food
[847.60 - 851.12] sustains itself and takes care of itself
[849.20 - 854.40] the thing is with wild foods that
[851.12 - 856.96] are really important wild foods like the
[854.40 - 860.48] wild blueberries are better than
[856.96 - 863.44] um organic so that's another thing too
[860.48 - 865.28] so wild food is better than organic so
[863.44 - 867.28] that keep that in mind
[865.28 - 868.40] and so it's incredible about this food
[867.28 - 870.56] is because
[868.40 - 871.84] the plants protect themselves to such a
[870.56 - 874.40] degree
[871.84 - 875.84] they that you don't have to be spraying
[874.40 - 877.28] spraying spraying spraying spring
[875.84 - 880.08] springs brain because that's it
[877.28 - 881.76] and that's what's incredible about it so
[880.08 - 883.44] if you get like a fly that comes from
[881.76 - 884.64] south america and it's once every couple
[883.44 - 887.28] of years and it gets bad at
[884.64 - 888.48] one little area of a crop or something
[887.28 - 889.28] and then they got to spray but they
[888.48 - 891.60] don't use the
[889.28 - 892.40] pollinator killers and now vegetables
[891.60 - 894.24] are different
[892.40 - 897.12] the conventional vegetable conventional
[894.24 - 899.92] vegetables conventional fruits
[897.12 - 902.00] they get sprayed three four times a week
[899.92 - 904.48] with pollinator killers
[902.00 - 905.76] and really bad sprays just three four
[904.48 - 908.32] times a week
[905.76 - 908.88] whole entire different thing and uh but
[908.32 - 913.84] anyway
[908.88 - 921.36] some info there how do you get it
[913.84 - 921.36] um so you can go to shop.wymans.com so
[923.72 - 927.84] shop.wymanswymans.com
[925.20 - 929.44] so that's where you can go making a
[927.84 - 931.20] mango salsa romaine
[929.44 - 933.12] boats so that's a little bit on how i
[931.20 - 935.92] take my shots
[933.12 - 937.68] and we're in this we got the mangoes we
[935.92 - 938.72] got the tomatoes we got the lettuce
[937.68 - 940.64] we're gonna do this we're talking about
[938.72 - 943.52] death by a thousand cuts
[940.64 - 945.12] and so and what i love about death by a
[943.52 - 945.44] thousand cuts is there's things you can
[945.12 - 947.76] do
[945.44 - 949.44] to slow down the cuts or stop the cuts
[947.76 - 950.96] or reverse the cuts
[949.44 - 952.88] you know and that's important too
[950.96 - 955.44] because we're doing all these things
[952.88 - 958.48] that aren't so good okay we're doing our
[955.44 - 962.48] colognes and perfumes right
[958.48 - 962.48] we got our colognes we got our perfumes
[962.56 - 966.08] and that one that one's just brutal
[964.96 - 968.64] right there
[966.08 - 970.72] you guys that one's bad too i mean this
[968.64 - 972.96] stuff is so harsh but this stuff lowers
[970.72 - 975.12] the immune system so clones perfumes
[972.96 - 977.28] lowers the immune system that's a cut
[975.12 - 978.96] you just got cut that's how it works
[977.28 - 980.00] right so you got that right there maybe
[978.96 - 982.40] you're doing tuna
[980.00 - 984.40] in a can right you got the metal from
[982.40 - 986.64] the can you got the merkur from tuna
[984.40 - 988.16] the mercury that's a couple of cuts
[986.64 - 991.44] right there okay
[988.16 - 994.24] and that's important too um
[991.44 - 995.12] yeah and that you know it's it's
[994.24 - 998.08] important to know
[995.12 - 999.36] right so we got that and wondering what
[998.08 - 1002.16] other cuts are you doing right
[999.36 - 1003.20] are you doing some eggs yeah death by a
[1002.16 - 1005.60] thousand cuts
[1003.20 - 1007.84] it's no joke because what happens with
[1005.60 - 1008.72] eggs is they feed all the bugs that keep
[1007.84 - 1010.24] people sick
[1008.72 - 1011.92] you're sick with a symptom you got
[1010.24 - 1012.80] different symptoms you got different
[1011.92 - 1015.28] conditions
[1012.80 - 1016.56] i talk about the pathogens involved for
[1015.28 - 1018.56] those symptoms and conditions and then
[1016.56 - 1020.88] we're eating eggs and then eggs
[1018.56 - 1022.08] so i didn't ruin anybody's eggs they
[1020.88 - 1025.76] were ruined before
[1022.08 - 1027.20] really important to know so um
[1025.76 - 1029.04] these are all just a couple of cuts
[1027.20 - 1031.28] right here
[1029.04 - 1032.56] right then you got your you're drinking
[1031.28 - 1034.08] out of your cans
[1032.56 - 1036.08] throughout your life you're drinking out
[1034.08 - 1037.60] here soda cans you drink even your
[1036.08 - 1039.92] healthier
[1037.60 - 1040.96] beverages and soft drinks like i'm at
[1039.92 - 1043.28] the store and
[1040.96 - 1044.96] hey this one says organic and it's in a
[1043.28 - 1048.16] can this one says

[1048.16 - 1051.60] it's in a can
[1049.04 - 1053.36] right this one's you know blah blah blah
[1051.60 - 1055.12] but what happens is that
[1053.36 - 1056.88] you're doing the aluminum that's another
[1055.12 - 1058.80] cut but they add up and they add up and
[1056.88 - 1059.44] they add up and they add up and they add
[1058.80 - 1061.44] up
[1059.44 - 1063.60] and that's what happens lunella says
[1061.44 - 1065.36] foraging for wild foods
[1063.60 - 1067.12] should be should be the new grocery
[1065.36 - 1068.16] shopping that would be incredible it'd
[1067.12 - 1069.92] be absolutely amazing
[1068.16 - 1071.52] anyway you guys with the wild wyman's

[1195.92 - 1200.72] going to scoop them out
[1198.56 - 1202.48] danielle says not sure i agree with the
[1200.72 - 1204.80] eggs lots of health people
[1202.48 - 1206.24] nutritionists etc recommend eggs to
[1204.80 - 1208.00] healthy protein
[1206.24 - 1210.80] it's so frustrating when all the
[1208.00 - 1214.96] information is so conflicting
[1210.80 - 1214.96] uh yeah no i
[1219.28 - 1225.20] hello yeah yeah
[1222.56 - 1227.68] now i heard what danielle said uh-huh i
[1225.20 - 1229.84] get it because everybody's talking eggs
[1227.68 - 1231.60] yeah they thought lots of things were
[1229.84 - 1233.12] healthy throughout the years
[1231.60 - 1234.80] uh-huh they thought lobotomies were
[1233.12 - 1237.84] healthy yeah
[1234.80 - 1240.96] every health professional every
[1237.84 - 1243.44] dietitian every doctor
[1240.96 - 1244.88] every professional every psychiatrist
[1243.44 - 1248.00] every therapist believe
[1244.88 - 1251.60] that removing the front of the
[1248.00 - 1252.40] brain from a young girl because she had
[1251.60 - 1255.84] anxiety
[1252.40 - 1258.88] was the best way to fix her yeah yeah
[1255.84 - 1262.24] it was it was it was always like that
[1258.88 - 1264.96] hundreds of thousands of of girls
[1262.24 - 1265.60] young women their the front of the brain
[1264.96 - 1268.48] was
[1265.60 - 1269.44] torn off yeah they had a probe go up
[1268.48 - 1272.40] their nostril
[1269.44 - 1272.40] right to the front of brain
[1272.80 - 1279.36] yeah this isn't funny because
[1276.72 - 1280.88] it happened and it's real every health
[1279.36 - 1283.36] professional
[1280.88 - 1284.48] thought it was the correct protocol and
[1283.36 - 1288.16] procedure
[1284.48 - 1289.92] yeah exactly for sure
[1288.16 - 1291.36] i know people protect their eggs because
[1289.92 - 1292.88] every health professional believes that
[1291.36 - 1295.04] they're good for us
[1292.88 - 1297.04] but i i think what people don't realize
[1295.04 - 1300.40] is that
[1297.04 - 1303.68] so i think what people don't realize
[1300.40 - 1306.96] is that sorry guys hold on a second
[1303.68 - 1310.56] sorry i think that people they don't
[1306.96 - 1310.56] realize a couple of things here that
[1311.52 - 1315.12] basically what happens is that here's
[1313.36 - 1317.44] how it works with eggs okay
[1315.12 - 1318.24] don't worry i hold on there's a call
[1317.44 - 1320.56] coming in
[1318.24 - 1323.44] oh i'm in between calls right here hold

[1347.20 - 1351.20] didn't hear anything
[1348.00 - 1353.44] yeah i took a sick day today yeah am i
[1351.20 - 1356.72] really home
[1353.44 - 1357.52] yeah i'm really home i am i didn't take
[1356.72 - 1359.52] the eggs
[1357.52 - 1363.04] you're gonna fire me i've been working
[1359.52 - 1363.04] at the egg factory for a long time
[1369.92 - 1376.16] [ __ ] guys guys be quiet guys be quiet
[1374.64 - 1377.76] no no i was just talking to a friend of
[1376.16 - 1378.40] mine yeah dropped me off some chicken
[1377.76 - 1382.56] soup
[1378.40 - 1384.80] i mean dropping off some some soup
[1382.56 - 1385.68] yeah no anyway no i didn't steal the
[1384.80 - 1388.40] eggs
[1385.68 - 1389.68] okay so just kind of leave me alone all
[1388.40 - 1391.68] right i got another call on the other
[1389.68 - 1395.28] line
[1391.68 - 1397.36] hello well see what you don't know
[1395.28 - 1398.56] is that everybody that's sick with
[1397.36 - 1400.24] chronic fatigue syndrome and
[1398.56 - 1401.52] fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis and
[1400.24 - 1402.72] so many other different diseases and
[1401.52 - 1405.04] conditions
[1402.72 - 1406.00] have bugs one of the bugs is called
[1405.04 - 1408.16] epstein-barr
[1406.00 - 1410.40] it was raised in the labs inside the
[1408.16 - 1413.92] eggs so what they did was
[1410.40 - 1415.04] they cut the top of the egg and they put
[1413.92 - 1416.56] the epstein bars
[1415.04 - 1418.16] and all the different pathogens in the
[1416.56 - 1420.56] egg and
[1418.16 - 1421.44] that's what they did and then we eat the
[1420.56 - 1424.16] eggs
[1421.44 - 1424.64] and we feed any bugs that are inside of
[1424.16 - 1427.20] us
[1424.64 - 1428.72] and that's how it works so the worst
[1427.20 - 1429.20] thing you could ever do is offer eggs
[1428.72 - 1431.68] for
[1429.20 - 1433.12] women with pcos and endometriosis it
[1431.68 - 1435.68] makes it worse
[1433.12 - 1436.96] if you have if you tell women with pcos
[1435.68 - 1438.40] to eat more eggs
[1436.96 - 1440.80] their androgen is going to get out of
[1438.40 - 1443.84] control it's not going to be fixable
[1440.80 - 1446.32] eggs are that that harmful
[1443.84 - 1446.96] for women when they're sick with chronic
[1446.32 - 1448.96] illness
[1446.96 - 1450.24] one of the medical medium tools was to
[1448.96 - 1452.00] remove eggs
[1450.24 - 1453.36] so that women can have a chance to heal
[1452.00 - 1455.12] different conditions
[1453.36 - 1456.48] so i get it i know that every health
[1455.12 - 1459.84] professional says that
[1456.48 - 1461.92] but just so you know that the lobotomies
[1459.84 - 1462.72] is just one out of hundreds of examples
[1461.92 - 1464.40] i can use
[1462.72 - 1466.16] where every health professional in the
[1464.40 - 1468.56] world agreed with it
[1466.16 - 1470.00] uh-huh yep now i got to put these guys
[1468.56 - 1472.64] down they're starting to get
[1470.00 - 1473.28] starting to get a little out of control
[1472.64 - 1475.92] oh okay
[1473.28 - 1478.56] i'll see you guys later i got to put
[1475.92 - 1478.56] these guys back
[1480.48 - 1483.84] all right we got to stop fooling around
[1481.92 - 1486.72] we we need to
[1483.84 - 1488.96] make these mango boats before it gets
[1486.72 - 1488.96] late
[1489.36 - 1492.96] kelly says doubtful it works like that
[1491.28 - 1496.48] you mean at the egg factory
[1492.96 - 1500.08] or or do you mean eggs
[1496.48 - 1500.96] actually it does work like that very
[1500.08 - 1503.52] important
[1500.96 - 1505.36] to know okay so i'm going to use another
[1503.52 - 1508.88] mango
[1505.36 - 1510.00] um it you got to listen to the egg pot
[1508.88 - 1511.92] podcast
[1510.00 - 1514.64] so what happened was all the different
[1511.92 - 1518.16] pathogens that we have today
[1514.64 - 1520.16] were raised in eggs okay and
[1518.16 - 1523.28] i'm going to give you a little 4-1-1
[1520.16 - 1523.28] about how it works
[1525.20 - 1530.48] the chronic illness is as bad as it is
[1528.80 - 1533.76] today because of this
[1530.48 - 1536.40] so there was no other food that would
[1533.76 - 1537.92] proliferate a pathogen in a controlled
[1536.40 - 1541.04] environment right
[1537.92 - 1543.76] so you couldn't inject a pathogen
[1541.04 - 1544.32] in an animal and then have control over
[1543.76 - 1546.64] it
[1544.32 - 1548.00] because the animal's immune system deer
[1546.64 - 1549.28] first flying everywhere so i'm gonna
[1548.00 - 1552.24] have deer for
[1549.28 - 1553.28] in my food but you can't control the
[1552.24 - 1555.12] environment so
[1553.28 - 1557.92] what happens with the medical industry
[1555.12 - 1560.96] the reason why they didn't use animals
[1557.92 - 1562.96] as the proliferator okay is because and
[1560.96 - 1564.72] i see a medical doctor's on too
[1562.96 - 1566.48] and you guys there's a lot of medical
[1564.72 - 1568.16] doctors that leave
[1566.48 - 1570.16] comments and just so you know they're
[1568.16 - 1572.32] blocked not by me
[1570.16 - 1573.92] but by facebook and instagram i'm
[1572.32 - 1576.32] letting you know okay
[1573.92 - 1577.28] um we've we've we've learned that
[1576.32 - 1579.60] recently
[1577.28 - 1580.40] that there are dozens and dozens of
[1579.60 - 1582.64] doctors
[1580.40 - 1584.00] and nurses that hey i'm a doctor and
[1582.64 - 1586.64] everything else and i never
[1584.00 - 1587.60] see their comment but i now have some
[1586.64 - 1589.60] friends
[1587.60 - 1591.44] that are going to be screen shooting
[1589.60 - 1592.00] them and all that stuff so they don't
[1591.44 - 1593.28] feel like
[1592.00 - 1595.84] i'm actually not answering their
[1593.28 - 1598.96] questions they always let dr fawn in
[1595.84 - 1602.08] which is amazing only eggs okay
[1598.96 - 1603.36] are eggplants amazing so um so here's
[1602.08 - 1605.12] the difference
[1603.36 - 1607.52] in they have to use the egg because the
[1605.12 - 1610.56] egg doesn't have its own immune system
[1607.52 - 1612.40] it doesn't so they used it as a living a
[1610.56 - 1615.04] living creature basically
[1612.40 - 1616.64] to in to inject pathogens so they can
[1615.04 - 1618.00] proliferate but the egg
[1616.64 - 1619.20] the reason why they proliferate in the
[1618.00 - 1620.48] egg because the egg doesn't have its own
[1619.20 - 1621.68] immune system and the proteins are
[1620.48 - 1623.20] undeveloped
[1621.68 - 1625.04] really important to know and that's the
[1623.20 - 1626.00] difference between surviving when you
[1625.04 - 1628.72] put a pathogen
[1626.00 - 1629.68] in an animal versus thriving they needed
[1628.72 - 1632.24] it to survive
[1629.68 - 1634.08] to thrive is what they needed it because
[1632.24 - 1635.76] when they injected them to animals
[1634.08 - 1638.08] the animal's immune system would take
[1635.76 - 1639.76] control over the pathogen and they would
[1638.08 - 1640.48] lose control over the pathogen you see
[1639.76 - 1642.32] how it works
[1640.48 - 1643.60] so what they do is they raise the
[1642.32 - 1645.68] pathogens in eggs
[1643.60 - 1654.08] then they injected those pathogens into
[1645.68 - 1656.80] animals for experimental
[1654.08 - 1657.44] hello why am i not making the mango
[1656.80 - 1659.92] salsa
[1657.44 - 1661.52] boats yet i don't know just kind of
[1659.92 - 1665.52] fooling around
[1661.52 - 1665.52] put down the deer all right
[1665.92 - 1669.92] all right guys that's the medical
[1667.60 - 1672.00] industry they don't want me
[1669.92 - 1674.00] talking about the pathogens inside the
[1672.00 - 1676.72] eggs and how everybody gets sick
[1674.00 - 1677.84] and uh huh it's ahead of the medical
[1676.72 - 1679.76] industry
[1677.84 - 1681.60] they want me to put the deer down and
[1679.76 - 1683.12] stop talking about what they do
[1681.60 - 1684.72] they want me to just make they want me
[1683.12 - 1687.92] to just be a food dummy
[1684.72 - 1689.36] mm-hmm yeah did you just say food dummy
[1687.92 - 1691.52] they want to be want me to be a food
[1689.36 - 1693.04] dummy you know like they just want me to
[1691.52 - 1694.08] talk about the health benefits of a
[1693.04 - 1698.08] tomato
[1694.08 - 1700.16] but only the science-based ones
[1698.08 - 1701.60] not even the real ones yeah they want me
[1700.16 - 1703.44] to just they want me to
[1701.60 - 1705.44] play around with food only and not tell
[1703.44 - 1707.20] you guys the truth about anything
[1705.44 - 1710.88] are you done i don't know how they got
[1707.20 - 1714.00] this number
[1710.88 - 1716.80] dr sherry green
[1714.00 - 1717.44] yep cruella dr sherry green good to see
[1716.80 - 1722.56] you
[1717.44 - 1722.56] amazing yeah all
[1723.76 - 1727.92] i'm right make some mangoes right here i
[1726.24 - 1729.12] got listen to the podcast the egg
[1727.92 - 1730.80] podcast seriously
[1729.12 - 1732.24] if you guys have any doubts listen to it
[1730.80 - 1732.88] medical mean podcasts at applecop
[1732.24 - 1735.28] podcast
[1732.88 - 1736.00] please listen to it if you can so i'm
[1735.28 - 1741.04] what i'm gonna do
[1736.00 - 1742.80] is i'm gonna um i'm making some mangoes
[1741.04 - 1745.04] mango pieces in here making a mango
[1742.80 - 1747.28] salsa and it's gonna be good
[1745.04 - 1747.28] okay
[1750.84 - 1756.16] teresa or the virus if it's in us
[1753.68 - 1758.00] and the eggs cooked would it be active
[1756.16 - 1758.96] well yeah the eggs could be cooked it's
[1758.00 - 1760.48] still an under
[1758.96 - 1762.56] underdeveloped protein and the
[1760.48 - 1765.76] underdeveloped protein is what the eggs
[1762.56 - 1767.28] was what sorry the pathogens know
[1765.76 - 1769.68] exist like that's what they've been feed
[1767.28 - 1773.12] on pathogens are
[1769.68 - 1776.72] a pathogen that's been raised
[1773.12 - 1779.12] never gets killed off right
[1776.72 - 1780.80] it gets in the people and then when it
[1779.12 - 1782.72] passes on to more people
[1780.80 - 1784.08] it still has all the information of how
[1782.72 - 1786.48] it was raised to begin with so it
[1784.08 - 1789.52] already knows that it eats eggs so
[1786.48 - 1790.40] and um yeah it's just what happens is
[1789.52 - 1792.24] i'm not
[1790.40 - 1793.84] i'm not anti-animal protein i'm not
[1792.24 - 1794.16] anti-vegan and plant-based you guys you
[1793.84 - 1796.08] guys
[1794.16 - 1797.52] aren't in uh you guys aren't at a vegan
[1796.08 - 1799.04] channel right now this is important to
[1797.52 - 1800.56] know you're not at a vegan channel where
[1799.04 - 1801.60] i'm gonna throw this vegan propaganda at
[1800.56 - 1803.60] you and you're not
[1801.60 - 1805.12] you're not at an animal protein channel
[1803.60 - 1805.60] or i'm just gonna throw all this vegan
[1805.12 - 1808.00] produce
[1805.60 - 1809.12] this bad vegan you know the the animal
[1808.00 - 1810.56] protein people
[1809.12 - 1811.84] tell all the mommies that they're
[1810.56 - 1812.72] starving their children feeding them
[1811.84 - 1816.32] lettuce
[1812.72 - 1817.68] and the you know the vegans and the
[1816.32 - 1819.28] plant-based people telling all the
[1817.68 - 1820.56] animal protein people that you
[1819.28 - 1822.16] you're soulless because you're killing
[1820.56 - 1822.48] animals and animals have souls and all
[1822.16 - 1824.72] this
[1822.48 - 1825.76] stuff i'm not into that i'm i'm into
[1824.72 - 1828.32] tools you're right
[1825.76 - 1829.04] i'm into tools like that's a tool right
[1828.32 - 1830.80] i'm into
[1829.04 - 1832.80] the three steps up two steps back three
[1830.80 - 1835.28] steps up then you're healed boom gone
[1832.80 - 1837.04] i'm into this everybody gets sick animal
[1835.28 - 1839.04] protein people get sick plant-based
[1837.04 - 1841.28] protein people get sick plant-based
[1839.04 - 1843.36] people get sick they both get sick
[1841.28 - 1845.12] and they both don't know what to do okay
[1843.36 - 1846.72] if your plant-based stay plant-based
[1845.12 - 1848.00] that's what i recommend if you're animal
[1846.72 - 1849.28] protein-based and that's what you love
[1848.00 - 1853.04] in all that you stay
[1849.28 - 1854.16] protein base you can you know but but
[1853.04 - 1856.72] you know it's important to know where
[1854.16 - 1858.72] you are right here someone might be like
[1856.72 - 1859.28] all right all right he's he's okay he's
[1858.72 - 1861.52] gonna
[1859.28 - 1862.64] he's all about just it's all vegan or
[1861.52 - 1865.52] something no
[1862.64 - 1867.60] but i i recommend if you're sick and you
[1865.52 - 1868.48] got symptoms and conditions i recommend
[1867.60 - 1870.64] as a
[1868.48 - 1871.60] animal protein person to avoid eggs and
[1870.64 - 1875.20] i recommend
[1871.60 - 1877.68] as a plant-based person to avoid
[1875.20 - 1879.04] going back to eggs because guess what
[1877.68 - 1882.32] plant-based people do
[1879.04 - 1886.96] here's what plant-based people do
[1882.32 - 1890.00] hello huh you've been plant-based
[1886.96 - 1892.56] really for what a year okay
[1890.00 - 1894.40] let's go how's it working for you you
[1892.56 - 1897.28] what's what's wrong
[1894.40 - 1898.80] you're all sudden got fatigued and your
[1897.28 - 1900.88] teeth are starting to have problems
[1898.80 - 1903.12] really you think it's really the
[1900.88 - 1905.52] plant-based thing
[1903.12 - 1907.12] you do you're eating eggs now and fish
[1905.52 - 1910.00] you're eating eggs and salmon
[1907.12 - 1911.68] so you went back to eggs okay all right
[1910.00 - 1913.04] i know a lot of vegan people run back to
[1911.68 - 1914.40] eggs a lot of plant-based people run
[1913.04 - 1916.00] back to eggs the first thing they run
[1914.40 - 1917.68] back to it's why a lot of plant-based
[1916.00 - 1918.88] people don't make fun of eggs
[1917.68 - 1921.36] they know it's a comfort food and they
[1918.88 - 1924.08] run back to it i know i know
[1921.36 - 1926.32] but are you sure it's the plant-based
[1924.08 - 1927.68] diet doing it or are you doing the
[1926.32 - 1929.60] plant-based diet
[1927.68 - 1931.20] wrong for what you need in your
[1929.60 - 1932.24] condition because that's what happens to
[1931.20 - 1934.24] animal protein people
[1932.24 - 1935.84] keto people run from this ray run for
[1934.24 - 1937.68] their lives from keto
[1935.84 - 1939.76] animal protein people who are eating all
[1937.68 - 1941.04] clean they all of a sudden get sick they
[1939.76 - 1942.40] don't know why they got sick and they
[1941.04 - 1943.04] get scared and they think they need to
[1942.40 - 1944.72] go vegan
[1943.04 - 1946.72] everybody's running across to the other
[1944.72 - 1949.68] side all the time i think
[1946.72 - 1950.24] it's more about tools it's more about
[1949.68 - 1953.60] tools
[1950.24 - 1956.24] yeah um yeah
[1953.60 - 1956.24] so there you go
[1956.96 - 1960.08] all right guys i gotta still make this
[1958.56 - 1964.16] mango salsa
[1960.08 - 1966.56] mango salsa coming our way
[1964.16 - 1966.56] um
[1967.36 - 1971.36] it's gonna be good knowing the cause of
[1969.36 - 1974.88] why you're sick is critical
[1971.36 - 1976.08] right that's critical that's the big one
[1974.88 - 1979.68] right there

[1990.08 - 1994.64] book real quick
[1992.56 - 1996.16] spirit of compassion has always said to
[1994.64 - 1998.64] me throughout the years of helping so
[1996.16 - 2002.48] many people heal that knowing the true
[1998.64 - 2006.48] cause knowing the true cause of
[2002.48 - 2008.08] why you're sick is half the battle one
[2006.48 - 2011.04] if you don't know the true cause of why
[2008.08 - 2013.44] you're sick we're gonna be in trouble
[2011.04 - 2014.88] i'll say it again if you don't if you
[2013.44 - 2017.92] don't know
[2014.88 - 2019.36] why you're sick we're gonna be throwing
[2017.92 - 2022.16] darts at barns
[2019.36 - 2022.72] guessing games running around trying to
[2022.16 - 2025.20] heal
[2022.72 - 2026.56] trying to fl this doctor that doctor we
[2025.20 - 2027.76] don't know what's going on that's what's
[2026.56 - 2030.80] gonna happen
[2027.76 - 2032.24] knowing why you're sick is critical or
[2030.80 - 2033.76] you're guessing games are happening and
[2032.24 - 2035.36] guess what happens to guessing games
[2033.76 - 2036.80] you might get a little better because
[2035.36 - 2038.32] you're cleaning up your diet
[2036.80 - 2039.60] right taking a few different random
[2038.32 - 2041.20] sorted supplements that maybe a
[2039.60 - 2044.32] practitioner has given you right
[2041.20 - 2046.00] but you end up sick again and again
[2044.32 - 2048.40] and again as time goes on then you're
[2046.00 - 2051.12] confused at 10 more doctor's offices
[2048.40 - 2052.56] that because unless you know why you're
[2051.12 - 2055.76] sick
[2052.56 - 2056.96] are you going to be able to do what you
[2055.76 - 2058.08] need to do and medical meme
[2056.96 - 2060.08] information is about a thousand
[2058.08 - 2060.96] protocols i call it basically instead of
[2060.08 - 2063.76] a thousand cuts
[2060.96 - 2065.76] it's a thousand ways to heal not a
[2063.76 - 2069.52] thousand ways to die
[2065.76 - 2070.96] right and so spirit of compassion has
[2069.52 - 2072.56] always said to me throughout the years
[2070.96 - 2074.00] helping so many people knowing the true
[2072.56 - 2075.52] cause of why you're sick is half the
[2074.00 - 2078.56] battle one you ready for this one

[2078.56 - 2082.96] do

[2090.24 - 2096.72] what to take and how to apply those
[2094.08 - 2097.20] tools is the other half battle one
[2096.72 - 2099.04] because

[2494.32 - 2496.80] good for you it's the last thing you
[2495.84 - 2498.88] need to hear
[2496.80 - 2500.08] here you are sick and you'll be told
[2498.88 - 2501.36] eggs are good for you
[2500.08 - 2504.16] maybe you're getting out maybe you're
[2501.36 - 2505.92] lacking protein how stupid is that one
[2504.16 - 2509.60] for so long now
[2505.92 - 2510.80] meanwhile science science also says that
[2509.60 - 2512.24] eggs are high in cholesterol and give
[2510.80 - 2514.40] you strokes and heart attack
[2512.24 - 2515.36] isn't that funny so who's right who's
[2514.40 - 2517.04] wrong
[2515.36 - 2518.40] what's science why are health
[2517.04 - 2520.08] professionals saying eggs are so good
[2518.40 - 2521.52] for you when science is actually saying
[2520.08 - 2522.88] they give you strokes and heart attack
[2521.52 - 2524.48] right
[2522.88 - 2525.60] and then science will come up out of
[2524.48 - 2526.88] nowhere and be like you know what
[2525.60 - 2527.76] actually you know eggs are good it's a
[2526.88 - 2529.52] good protein
[2527.76 - 2532.08] it's like which way you're gonna go man
[2529.52 - 2532.08] which way
[2534.84 - 2537.84] right
[2540.48 - 2551.12] doing some tomatoes in the salsa gonna
[2542.16 - 2553.44] do a little bit more
[2551.12 - 2555.52] i think the bottom line is when you get
[2553.44 - 2559.52] sick right
[2555.52 - 2563.12] all bets are off all bets are off
[2559.52 - 2564.96] that's it it's like man
[2563.12 - 2566.32] it's just about getting the information
[2564.96 - 2568.80] and getting better
[2566.32 - 2569.60] right isn't it amazing that you think
[2568.80 - 2571.44] people think that
[2569.60 - 2572.72] if you don't have a letter after your
[2571.44 - 2576.84] name
[2572.72 - 2579.84] anthony williams dsbb

[2589.92 - 2594.32] name health coach whatever if you don't
[2591.68 - 2598.00] have something after your name right
[2594.32 - 2599.52] then don't listen to that person right
[2598.00 - 2601.36] it doesn't matter how much experience
[2599.52 - 2602.88] they have how many doctors they
[2601.36 - 2604.88] they've helped over the years doesn't
[2602.88 - 2606.80] matter
[2604.88 - 2608.64] it doesn't matter of anything right
[2606.80 - 2610.08] doesn't matter the most powerful people
[2608.64 - 2611.84] in the world
[2610.08 - 2613.52] have reached out to you for the last 30
[2611.84 - 2615.76] years because they've had access to
[2613.52 - 2617.76] every single doctor there is
[2615.76 - 2619.76] and all the money in the world to go to
[2617.76 - 2621.04] every place fly around the world but yet
[2619.76 - 2623.76] they're
[2621.04 - 2625.28] at the medical mediums door right but
[2623.76 - 2627.20] that doesn't matter because i don't have
[2625.28 - 2630.24] any letters after
[2627.20 - 2631.76] after my name gotta have letters right
[2630.24 - 2634.64] letters mean everything like i couldn't
