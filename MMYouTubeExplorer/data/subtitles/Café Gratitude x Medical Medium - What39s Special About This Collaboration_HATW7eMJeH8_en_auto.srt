32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,960
medical medium recipes and he was like

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,320
spices no oils which you know really

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,520

68
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:40,040
processed you know sort of plant-based

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,959

74
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,000
guidelines that you're promoting out in

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,360
