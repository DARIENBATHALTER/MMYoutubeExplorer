00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,600
have you been doing each MDS all these

123
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,940
years have you been incorporating wild

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,380
blueberries into your life while

125
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,419
blueberries are different than

126
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,280
cultivated blueberries

127
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,139
so I want to run down a few things about

128
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,940
that too as we get going we're talking

129
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,400
about ancient food

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,800
ancient peoples

131
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,060
eating ancient food we're going to go

132
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,280
into that a little bit too that's

133
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,199
actually gonna going to be kind of fun I

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,780
think going into that so I'm going to

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,479
turn this waffle maker up a little bit

136
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,380
I'm gonna get it moving because I want

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,000
to get some waffles going so

138
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,400
here's what we're gonna do we're gonna

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,060
actually peel these are steamed potatoes

140
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,039
let's get these over here I got one big

141
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,560
bowl of steamed potatoes right there

142
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,340
look at that you guys

143
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:47,280
one big bowl of steamed potatoes really

144
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,860
excited about this Tyler says I felt

145
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,720
like I was glowing naturally High all

146
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,720
morning for my wild blueberry bowl last

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,900
night it gives me that feeling too like

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
it's just a natural high but when you

149
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,160
really break it down you're talking

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,720
about a food that has survived on this

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,660
planet for thousands and thousands of

152
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,259
years it has information in it survival

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,000
information it's an incredible resource

154
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,520
the wild blueberry so it's not like

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,280
having some cultivated blueberry which

156
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,020
doesn't give us that feeling and now it

157
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,900
never gave me that feeling of cultivated

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,039
blueberry so I'm gonna peel back some of

159
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,039
the skin

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,419
I'm going to peel back some of the skin

161
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,300
on

162
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,699
this potato these are steamed potatoes I

163
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,860
like doing it that way so you don't have

164
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,240
to take all the skin off you can you

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,639
know but I like doing it because you're

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,500
making waffles and you wanted a certain

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,300
texture

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,860
you know that's a great way to do it so

169
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,580
I'm going to put this right here in a

170
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,220
bowl

171
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm going to peel back the skin on a

172
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,580
bunch of them I'm going to make a few

173
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,520
different waffles which I'm actually

174
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,600
really excited about

175
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,600
so you know a lot of people would be

176
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,120
like paleo man ancient man what do they

177
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,520
eat they eat meat meat meat that's what

178
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,860
it was it was all about hunters hunters

179
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,500
and gatherers but mainly Hunters

180
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,600
surviving on meat and meat alone right

181
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,039
you hear that all the time you know and

182
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,020
then the vegans are like no they're

183
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,300
Gathering they're Gathering they were

184
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,500
surviving on Plants right you know and

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,380
you know there's always that big

186
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,099
argument right there always happening

187
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,080
you got the animal protein side of of

188
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,479
the health movement then you got the

189
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,940
vegan side of the health movement

190
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,580
you have that and then you know sad

191
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,620
enough vegans they get scared and they

192
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,620
run back to the animal protein movement

193
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,419
the animal protein movement they'll do

194
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,340
the same they'll run back the vegetarian

195
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,580
or vegan or something but that's another

196
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,099
story another talk for another day

197
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,199
but what did people eat well it depends

198
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,780
on what part of the planet they were on

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
to begin with that's one right there

200
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,639
that's one place to understand

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,639
and that determined also a decent amount

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,240
but one thing's for sure berries were

203
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,340
growing everywhere on the planet that

204
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,900
anything can grow so berries have always

205
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,380
been around now

206
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:12,419
wild blueberries have been here for a

207
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,479
very very long time

208
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:18,840
so now what did ancient people survive

209
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,220
on now to begin with hunting was not a

210
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,639
definitive

211
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,800
factor that kept people alive back in

212
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,680
the ancient days so keep that in mind

213
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,960
okay because you can the amount of

214
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,360
calories and I actually taught about

215
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,140
this for over 35 plus years the amount

216
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,099
of calories you needed in order to hunt

217
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:44,540
was unbelievable you can't just hunt on

218
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,040
no calories we're talking about

219
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:51,540
traveling it's not like you go outside

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,300
your door of your Hut or whatever your

221
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,040
your little shelter and then you hunt it

222
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,080
five feet away

223
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,480
especially if the what the weather was

224
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,640
doing hunting would take a tremendous

225
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
amount of traveling where the animals

226
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,560
were in order to hunt right and then it

227
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:15,300
took physical physical strength to hunt

228
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,700
and to rhyme right and to carry the

229
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,040
Beast back as well so if you're hunting

230
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,899
it took a lot of physical strength to

231
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,260
carry the Beast back

232
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:28,260
this took a lot of calories

233
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,220
important to know so ancient people

234
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,860
right if they relied only on Hunting it

235
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,740
would have not survived

236
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,580
just the way it works they would not

237
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,700
have survived if they were relying just

238
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,380
on hunting and hunting alone

239
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,000
so that's an important thing to

240
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,620
understand because a lot of people are

241
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,300
like no it was all hunting and it was

242
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,140
all meat

243
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,880
but that's not accurate so then there

244
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,640
were times where

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,380
hunting was really really scarce and

246
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,700
it's been like that on this planet over

247
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,800
and over again

248
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,600
so what did ancient people really

249
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,320
survive on well first of all there was

250
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,060
always somebody they used in the village

251
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,519
or community

252
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:20,100
to taste test poisonous plant species

253
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,440
first and foremost there was always

254
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,839
somebody that had to do the taste

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,140
testing

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,080
98 of all the mushrooms growing on this

257
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,220
planet throughout these centuries were

258
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,500
toxic

259
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,500
so there'd always be a taste tester to

260
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,380
discover which mushroom may not be toxic

261
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,440
in order to allow a mushroom to enter

262
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,399
into the diet of ancient you know

263
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,940
ancient human beings ancient people

264
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,940
so

265
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,740
keep that in mind same thing with

266
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,220
berries berries were taste were taste

267
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,320
tested along the way right now there's

268
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,800
berries with really really dangerous

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:07,560
alkaloids these alkaloids would kill you

270
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,560
really quickly and sometimes kill you

271
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,920
really really slowly so keep that in

272
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,320
mind too so when it came down to ancient

273
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,260
people and food it was a lot of Hit and

274
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,079
Miss trial and error and that's what it

275
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,959
was about for many many times for many

276
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,940
many years thousands upon thousands of

277
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,640
years it was like that

278
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,360
so that's something to

279
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,360
think about

280
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:37,980
so a lot of people died

281
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,140
trying to find their way into what was

282
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,779
safe in The Plant World to eat now

283
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,339
there's a lot of plant species that if

284
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:47,579
consumed

285
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:50,640
your liver would shut down

286
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:53,399
or your kidneys would shut down

287
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,500
a lot of plant species

288
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,480
so it made it very difficult for

289
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,540
survival

290
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,180
depending on the region too

291
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,519
so once this was figured out along the

292
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:09,019
way what was safe what wasn't and there

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,019
were still lots of trial by Era

294
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,839
certain things were established certain

295
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,720
berries were established too

296
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
and that's important to know

297
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,760
[Applause]

298
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,680
all right so I'm just cleaning up my

299
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,320
board a little bit I'm getting some

300
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,540
potato it's all set right here all

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,100
skinned down

302
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,019
so what I did was I took some of the

303
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,860
skins off right here good to see you

304
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,140
guys

305
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,579
I see that someone said Wyman's yep it's

306
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,779
Wyman's that's what it is it's the wild

307
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,660
blueberry juice

308
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,339
is what we're using right that's the

309
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,680
wild blueberry shots right there it's an

310
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,240
incredible product I work with Wyman's I

311
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,639
support them I want the stuff to stay

312
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,079
around it's an incredible resource what

313
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,200
it takes to get them out of the field

314
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:54,600
this ancient food and then to actually

315
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,139
press them and to get them in the bottle

316
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,019
and what I love is all it is is wild

317
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:06,920
blueberry juice and that's what I love

318
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,920

so nice

321
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,120
so nice

322
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,639
so these potatoes are already steamed

323
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,019
keep that in mind

324
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:25,680
I got the waffle iron heating up here

325
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:28,440
these potatoes are already steamed and

326
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,100
ready to go I am going to mash them

327
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,839
but I'm going to find my Masher

328
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,639
here they are

329
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,200
here it is and here's the potatoes so

330
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,959
let's go so I'm going to do a little bit

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
of potato mashing right now

332
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:44,279
now

333
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,019
ancient people ate a lot of shoots keep

334
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,200
that in mind

335
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,380
paolita says we can we can get wild

336
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,139
blueberry juice yes it's the Wyman's

337
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,899
wild blueberry juice right there

338
00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:01,160
where can you get it Wyman's link is in

339
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,160
the description link is in the profile

340
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,600
w-y-m-a-n-s.com wines.com

341
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,600
that's where you find it right there

342
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,260
so

343
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,839
shoots were something that ancient

344
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,440
people ate what was a shoot

345
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,899
well you got shoots You Got Roots you

346
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,440
got rhizomes

347
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:28,320
you got mushrooms you've got Twigs you

348
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,320
got fruit like berries

349
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,940
ancient figs

350
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,300
depending on the region and where you

351
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,820
are but all regions there was always

352
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,160
some type of shoot you can eat

353
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,380
hence like the asparagus the asparagus

354
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,480
is a derivative from an ancient food

355
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,060
from an ancient shoot

356
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,320
and then you got tubers it's another one

357
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,839
too

358
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,120
so in these ancient Foods

359
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,579
throughout the centuries a lot of people

360
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,620
died trying out different rhizomes

361
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:03,800
different tubers

362
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,800
different berries different shoots

363
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,920
to get here it was a long road for

364
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,079
ancient people

365
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,880
it's not something like we see now where

366
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,500
it's pretty easy we got we have a clear

367
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,399
understanding of what we can eat and

368
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,399
what we can't eat

369
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,839
and even today we eat things we're not

370
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,240
supposed to eat after all's been said

371
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
and done we still actually eat things

372
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,339
that we're not supposed to eat how crazy

373
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,180
is that things are actually not good for

374
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,380
us and we still do that now

375
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,880
when you really think about that that's

376
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,740
amazing

377
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,880
that's kind of funny so I'm mashing

378
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,380
these up you guys because I'm making

379
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,260
waffles then I'm going to make a wild

380
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,600
blueberry sauce it's in the book right

381
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,560
here the brain saver books just want to

382
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,300
show you

383
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,300
talking about ancient people but we're

384
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,180
also making that right there

385
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,639
excited about it check that out

386
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,639
it's gonna be fun also making a drink

387
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,740
honey orange wild blueberry refresher

388
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,660
how insane is that

389
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,880
it's gonna be really fun

390
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,100
okay so I'm giving these guys a good

391
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,860
Mash you don't want your waffles really

392
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,199
lumpy you don't have to puree them

393
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,600
that's not what you want to do you just

394
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,240
want to break them up a little bit and

395
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,339
mash them some potatoes are softer than

396
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,339
the others this one right here is a

397
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,160
really firm potato the waffle recipe is

398
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,720
in the book Brain saver I'm gonna be

399
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,980
reading out a brain saver it's in the

400
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,320
protocols book

401
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,880
so I'm excited

402
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,740
so let me just now she's a little bit

403
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,740
more gonna make some good waffles

404
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,620
so

405
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,420
what did ancient man eat well Ancient

406
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,600
Man didn't survive on meat and meat

407
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,600
alone

408
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,380
if that was

409
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,759
the only option very little survival

410
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,399
would happen

411
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,339
so would often would often would occur

412
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,160
is the drying of things

413
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:05,339
so the way we survived and got here

414
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,220
today it was from drying

415
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:10,799
trying everything and anything that's

416
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,559
what it was about

417
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:17,179
okay we're just about there here just

418
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,179
about there there we go

419
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,480
all right all right all right crashed

420
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,819
crash

421
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,500
but that's why I like being live

422
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,480
you know I wake up in the morning I'll

423
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,820
tell SOC you think I'll let like knock

424
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,679
stuff over today

425
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,059
so she's like trying not to I'm like no

426
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,580
let's hope I do

427
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,400
all right

428
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,720
so let's make some waffles

429
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,720
yeah oops

430
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,299
so I'm gonna actually make these into

431
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,580
like a little ball I'm gonna put them

432
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,600
into the waffle iron I'm gonna bring the

433
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,600
waffle iron up here

434
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:59,039
we are alive

435
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,320
all right now I don't want this too big

436
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,260
because if this is a small waffle maker

437
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,080
these waffles are like thin

438
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,080
if I make it too big

439
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,880
it's just gonna be like trouble so I'm

440
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,880
thinking that's probably it right there

441
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,600
yeah nice all right

442
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,600
see if we could drop something else

443
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,100
oh sorry about that

444
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,360
you're getting upset because I'm

445
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,460
knocking all this over and

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,520
everything

447
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,059
are you getting upset

448
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,059
okay

449
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,020
oh

450
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,039
foreign

451
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,980
this waffle iron is

452
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,980
getting hot

453
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:03,320
it's flip hot

454
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,320
all right we're gonna pop this in here

455
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,200
you guys it was just

456
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,520
if you just got here

457
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,780
day three of the wild blueberry

458
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,240
challenge

459
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,940
day three

460
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,940
magically appeared or some of these

461
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,539
all right I'm gonna throw this in here

462
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,780
I can't help it I like to throw stuff in

463
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,780
the air

464
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,700
let's just

465
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,380
turn this around in a second but first I

466
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,520
have to do this before I do that so I'm

467
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,780
going to show you guys I'm going to

468
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,240
knock this

469
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,440
together now I might have made this one

470
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,440
too big of a waffle

471
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,500
do you guys like waffles these are

472
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,900
potato waffles

473
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,179
they're more than gluten free they're

474
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,039
grain free for people that are really

475
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:11,360
worried about grains

476
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,360
they're grain free

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,760
if you listen to my alien podcast

478
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,980
you guys medical medium

479
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,820
podcasts at Apple podcast did you listen

480
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,820
to the alien episode

481
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,260
that's an interesting episode it's got

482
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,539
good information in there

483
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,160
it's actually really cool

484
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,419
all right I'm gonna see what I got here

485
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,419
I'm not gonna open this up yet

486
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,260
I'm just pushing it down a little bit I

487
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,640
put more

488
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,640
batter in that one

489
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,799
grab myself another hand towel

490
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,799
all right cool

491
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,799
so I'm going to make another two

492
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,620
we got a couple to do

493
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,640
so

494
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:12,140
let's get back to ancient people's talk

495
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,140
let's talk a little bit more

496
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,340
survival depended on drying things

497
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,799
bottom line

498
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,440
wild blueberries were picked

499
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,240
during season

500
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,799
and then dried

501
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,799
before winter approached

502
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,960
if it was climate that was still

503
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,659
somewhat tropical or subtropical winter

504
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,960
still approached Seasons still change in

505
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:46,440
subtropical conditions places

506
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,299
regardless wherever the berry was picked

507
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,860
they were dried now certain berries

508
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:53,700
don't dry good

509
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,919
so if it's a wild raspberry it's not a

510
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,000
great

511
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,820
drying Berry

512
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
not a great survival

513
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,460
tool but yet all berries were dried for

514
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,539
the most part but not only that other

515
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,539
things were dried too

516
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,940
that's how survival happens I'm just

517
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,940
getting another waffle ready

518
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:18,440
just rinsing my hands

519
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,940
if berries didn't exist on this planet

520
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:34,020
there's a good chance

521
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,140
we may not have made it this far

522
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,240
because ancient people had to rely on

523
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,080
drying berries in order to make it

524
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,080
through seasons

525
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:47,700
here's a dried Berry right here here's

526
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:49,440
the Wyman's whole dried wild berries

527
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,080
which is really cool too by the way

528
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,740
check it out what did it look like let

529
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,740
me open this up

530
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,140
I'm gonna move my waffle maker over

531
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,159
want to look at these wild dried berries

532
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,159
right here

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,740
so that's how survival really happened

534
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,340
right there branching people

535
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:28,440
it was drying things and then carrying

536
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,039
with you as you traveled all the dried

537
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,039
items

538
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,820
these are the dried Wild lubers

539
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,820
pretty awesome

540
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,360
Theresa says thank you for making these

541
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,419
videos I want to make these videos I

542
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,980
want you guys to have information

543
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:49,620
I want you to be able to watch these

544
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,419
again if you wanted to I like the recipe

545
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,740
videos and that's what this kind of is

546
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,220
in the end really I'm making some

547
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,220
waffles

548
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,059
I think I gotta make the sauce that I

549
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,919
have to do pretty soon have you guys

550
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:04,080
tried the wild blueberries have you

551
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,940
tried the wild blueberry juice what have

552
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,919
you experienced I know what I

553
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,400
experienced when I have it

554
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,460
host any real stories or anything else

555
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,080
or posts of any kind and I at Medical

556
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,000
medium or tag at Medical medium or

557
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,679
hashtag medical medium whatever do both

558
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,679
so I could see it and then repost it

559
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,720
guys don't mind right

560
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,419
getting a little tipsy that's why I'm

561
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,059
knocking everything over

562
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,760
Dr nesmet might show up later

563
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:37,760
wants to do an examination on hoot

564
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,080
ew's Bar and Grill is getting pretty

565
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,080

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,600
who's why you been so quiet

567
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,679
I'd never heard you so quiet it's the

568
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,539
craziest thing

569
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,539
Hoots usually making a lot of noise

570
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,500
okay I think I also need

571
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,880
[Music]

573
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,799
it's getting crazy in here I think I

574
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,840
need a glass of wine too because who

575
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,700
wants a glass of wine that's it you

576
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,220
don't know how to speak owl

I was gonna have the glass of wine but

586
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,820
apparently

587
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,020
glass of wine

588
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,700
all right let's get into it a little bit

589
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,140
I want to read a little bit out of brain

590
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,679
saver

591
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,679
perfect

592
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,659
all right

593
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,659
let's go you guys

594
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,440
waffle is not done yet

595
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,820
you guys you know

596
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,500
it's always like this at aw's kitchen

597
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:25,020
that's all I could say all right so I'm

598
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,760
on page 93 right here I got the brain

599
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,220
saver book have you checked out the

600
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,840
brain saver books anybody new here that

601
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,580
hasn't seen the brain saver books both

602
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,200
the protocols book and this one right

603
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,200
here there's two which is really one

604
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,240
it's a huge book originally publisher

605
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,880
couldn't publish it they couldn't do it

606
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,260
the printing was too hard became two

607
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,539
massive books filled with information

608
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,179
packed with information

609
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,100
and so these are the brain saver books

610
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,779
right here this is one of them a reading

611
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,400
out of it Amazon's selling them right

612
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,820
now get them for gifts for friends and

613
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,679
family you guys are 40 off right now

614
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,820
amazon.com us which is really incredible

615
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,880
and

616
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,919
I am happy about that so every day so

617
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,799
I'm reading page 93

618
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,740
so we'll get into it right now

619
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:13,140
everyday toxins and poisons inside the

620
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,659
brain are a large part of the brain's

621
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,620
limitations we experience so if someone

622
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:21,659
has a brain limitation of any kind

623
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,020
we're talking about toxins and poisons

624
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:29,100
inside our brain so if somebody has a

625
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:32,360
brain limitation of any kind

626
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,360
we're dealing with

627
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,460
some kind of toxin or poison that's

628
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,460
inside the brain

629
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,400
we experience so including emotional

630
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,260
limitations so if someone has emotional

631
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,779
limitations we got something that's

632
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,880
inside the brain that's in the way if we

633
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:53,940
have an emotional limitation

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,360
this is mind-blowing information to me

635
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,720
if an area of the brain is clouded

636
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,340
with an abundant level of poisons and

637
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,919
toxins

638
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,559
ranging from toxic heavy metals to

639
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,500
solvents to Plastics and other

640
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:12,539
petrochemicals to Pharmaceuticals

641
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,480
that have been there for 20 years 30

642
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:17,820
years to air fresheners

643
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,580
to fragrances descented candles which

644
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,940
get into the brain and beyond that area

645
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,799
of the brain that's clouded with these

646
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,679
brain betrayers

647
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,260
can almost go into a sleep mode

648
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,620
so what that means is if there's an area

649
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,380
of the brain filled with enough garbage

650
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,299
enough Pharmaceuticals enough toxins

651
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:42,299
enough poisons enough anything right

652
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:44,000
heavy metals petrochemicals all the

653
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,320
different stuff are up against chemicals

654
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,640
chemical solvents everything that we

655
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,620
breathe in every day everything we're

656
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,620
exposed to if there's an area in the

657
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:56,100
brain that's filled with enough of that

658
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:59,460
it can actually put that area of the

659
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,039
brain into sleep mode it dumbs that part

660
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,140
of the brain down and puts it into sleep

661
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,520
mode

662
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,980
it's incredible because you don't hear

663
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,960
that from research in science you don't

664
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,200
hear that from anywhere

665
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,240
it's just amazing information so this

666
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,260
doesn't mean we'll be sleeping so it

667
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,940
doesn't mean you're always going to be

668
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,580
sleeping just because you might have a

669
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,100
toxin or poison deep into the brain

670
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,539
someplace into this area where it's

671
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,919
actually putting that area into sleep

672
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:27,960
mode it doesn't mean that now you're

673
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,000
going to be sleeping

674
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,260
or that waffle smelling good at this

675
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,720
point

676
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,360
it means an area of our brain is not

677
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,799
functioning optimally so that means an

678
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,640
area of the brain is not functioning

679
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,000
good

680
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,260
so we'll rely more on other parts of our

681
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,100
brain

682
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,919
whoa see so when stuff gets gunked up

683
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:54,600
and junked up inside our brain we end up

684
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:57,659
relying on another part of our brain

685
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,000
that's less clouded and clogged up with

686
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,919
toxins it also means we'll be limited in

687
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,179
brain function you see a lot of people

688
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,740
out there they're struggling you've got

689
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,240
the brain fog they got all the different

690
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,179
brain conditions right they're

691
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,640
struggling because they're limited

692
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:14,960
because their brain is not functioning

693
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,960
the way it needs to function

694
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,620
in 10 years

695
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,360
you guys are going to see it

696
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,500
a lot of people's brains aren't going to

697
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,460
be working

698
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:28,140
five years now it's really kicking up

699
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,659
when emotional centers of the brain

700
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,640
become filled up and cladded with toxins

701
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:34,679
and poisons now that's the emotional

702
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,020
centers of the brain you guys that's an

703
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,720
entirely different area of the brain

704
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,880
we become more reliant on other parts of

705
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,760
our brain as a result we can become

706
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,740
limited in our emotional understanding

707
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,260
of others

708
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,880
that's when we can't really understand

709
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,820
others

710
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,100
because in our emotional center of the

711
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,100
brain there's some type of contamination

712
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,980
and that contamination can make it so we

713
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,179
can't be understanding on any level to

714
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,159
others

715
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:07,340
right do you ever hear those stories out

716
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:07,340
there

717
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,220
Waffle's still cooking do you ever hear

718
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,220
those stories out there

719
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,919
where it's like

720
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,740
the person to be like

721
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,260
my parents just don't understand me they

722
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,320
just don't get it or my stepdad doesn't

723
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,940
get it or you know somebody that my

724
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,880
stepmom doesn't get it

725
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,500
or my uncle doesn't get it my aunt

726
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,840
doesn't get it my brother doesn't get it

727
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,820
my sister doesn't get it and you ever

728
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,620
hear those stories out there it's like

729
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,120
you know the person's like going through

730
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,399
a lot they're struggling they're

731
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,460
suffering they've been through a lot but

732
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,980
for some reason siblings or family or

733
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,159
friends or best friends just don't get

734
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,100
it or understand at all what's going on

735
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,980
because that person that sibling that

736
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:58,559
Mom that Dad that the uncle that best

737
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,539
friend that partner whoever it is has

738
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,159
something clouding up that emotional

739
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,960
center of the brain you guys are reading

740
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,820
brain saver right now

741
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,039
which is Incredible Book to get to

742
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,380
people for the holidays and everything

743
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,159
both these books

744
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,159
two books

745
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,740
so we can become Limited in getting in

746
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,899
touch with our emotional state we can

747
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,179
become Limited in feeling and expressing

748
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:27,120
emotions Limited in harnessing emotions

749
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,640
too so if it happens to us it happens to

750
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,080
you it happens to anybody then all of a

751
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,840
sudden it's hard to even get in touch

752
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,720
with your own emotional state

753
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,000
you feel like you're always just lost in

754
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
that depersonalization kicks in too and

755
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,299
that's what happens when also

756
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,140
contaminants get into the emotional

757
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,140
centers of the brain

758
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,320
toxins and poisons clogging up the

759
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,419
emotional centers of our brain can also

760
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,820
mean that we become extremely emotional

761
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,740
without understanding why how about that

762
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,659
she ever meet anybody they get really

763
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,279
emotional they don't know why so now

764
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,539
they're going to somebody else to see

765
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,279
they're going to see a past life

766
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,140
regressionist now they're going to see a

767
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,640
therapist now they're going to see

768
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,080
somebody else now they're going they're

769
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,279
just like they're searching and

770
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,740
searching

771
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,539
because they don't understand why they

772
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,539
become extremely emotional and they

773
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:17,700
don't know why so they want answers

774
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:19,860
sometimes they get the answer that like

775
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,659
you know 300 years ago they were Queen

776
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,220
Victoria or queen somebody and they got

777
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:25,220
their heads chopped off and that's why

778
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,519
in a past life and that's why they're so

779
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,860
emotional because no one knows why

780
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,059
someone really is struggling emotionally

781
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,260
like that they don't know that inside

782
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,120
the brain

783
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,919
they got old Pharmaceuticals sitting in

784
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,240
there they got toxic heavy metal sitting

785
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,100
there they got all these other things

786
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,320
that are sitting inside the brain and

787
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,419
brain stem getting in the way nobody

788
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,120
knows so we got to come up with all

789
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:50,580
kinds of you know cool things I'm not

790
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,919
saying whatever I'm just saying that it

791
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:55,620
happens a lot

792
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,659
Reggie Natura says that was me before

793
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,000
medical medium

794
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,100
dreams can become very intense it's

795
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,320
another thing that happens too extremely

796
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:06,240
emotionally challenging where constant

797
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,639
dream After Dream After Dream evokes

798
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,500
emotions because the body is trying to

799
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,260
heal the emotional centers of the brain

800
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,179
so if you ever have struggling dreams it

801
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,339
depends on where all the toxins and the

802
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,020
poisons and everything is all inside the

803
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,879
brain and where and what part of the

804
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,800
emotional centers of the brain

805
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,800
but if you've ever had this

806
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,879
um there's there's a reason why that we

807
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,980
dream like we do because our body is

808
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,339
trying to out override it to do some

809
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,339
healing

810
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,080
so Ruth says there are people with

811
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,500
limited emotional intelligence

812
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,940
but seriously it is not always so

813
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,679
there's people with limited emotional

814
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,760
intelligence

815
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,220
everybody has Intelligence number one so

816
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,420
that's there

817
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,040
um that's not what you're saying that's

818
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,660
what I'm saying so your comment is there

819
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,119
are people with limited emotional

820
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,820
intelligence but seriously it is not

821
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,200
always about nutrition

822
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,960
but I know that's not always about

823
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,240
nutrition though it is talk though it is

824
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,640
toxic

825
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,160
we have many so toxic is what you mean

826
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,160
we have many paths that are connected

827
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,880
I'm not saying it's all about nutrition

828
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,780
medical medium information

829
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,640
is a vast amount of information so Ruth

830
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,599
what I what I recommend is you get the

831
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,760
books

832
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,099
did the brain saver books maybe cleanse

833
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,660
the heel tube maybe live a rescue and

834
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,320
learn about the incredible information

835
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,599
here including Soul information

836
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,140
including

837
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,579
you know other information too

838
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,500
but thank you for your comment and I'm

839
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,760
glad you're here I appreciate it and by

840
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,900
the way you're at the free Wild

841
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,940
blueberry

842
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,520
challenge were day three we're making

843
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,380
wild blueberries it's an incredible food

844
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,180
and you might want to get some wild

845
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,920
blueberries sign up for the challenge

846
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,660
too and you could actually get your free

847
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,980
grocery list and know what you need and

848
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,720
all that other stuff for it and you

849
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,820
could even re-watch the episodes at

850
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,160
medicalmedium.com

851
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,500
but what I recommend is getting some of

852
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,140
this inside of you so it gets to the

853
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,119
brain so then when you grab the medical

854
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,880
medium books Ruth

855
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,280
it'll help you actually open up so you

856
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,619
know what you're reading

857
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,760
Ruth says I think the information is

858
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:29,640
valid

859
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,760
well then guess what I am

860
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,560
I am proven wrong

861
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,000
and proven right

862
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,579
thank you

863
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,339
I'm proven both

864
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,380
proven wrong because I'm saying that you

865
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:46,440
need wild blueberry juice

866
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,220
and proven right because you said that

867
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,220
you like the information

868
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,200
um

869
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,780
Ruth I need some more wild blueberry

870
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,460
juice that's what I think

871
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,619
Brett Winters and by the way thank you

872
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,420
for your comment once again

873
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,400
Brett Winters aw what's the difference

874
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,320
between what you're talking about and

875
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,359
narcissism

876
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,980
what's the difference

877
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:14,040
well it all depends narcissism

878
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,660
is one aspect of how the brain works if

879
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,280
someone actually has problems but the

880
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,020
soul is always connected too because you

881
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,700
have four things going on so the problem

882
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,280
is with the brain and I talk about that

883
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,980
in the brain saver books

884
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,240
is you have your subconscious mind your

885
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,460
conscious mind

886
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,339
your physical brain and your soul they

887
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,900
all have to work together

888
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,079
in here

889
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,900
okay then that's critical to know

890
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,880
narcissism can be a blend of problems

891
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,560
so keep that in mind

892
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,720
and a narcissist

893
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,400
could also be a good person

894
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,880
so it doesn't mean they're a bad

895
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,920
narcissist versus a good narcissist so

896
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,060
keep that in mind too so all these

897
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,880
things matter

898
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,460
because that's about the soul

899
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,920
Soul subconscious mind conscious mind

900
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,140
and physical brain all these things

901
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,880
combine change everything

902
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,079
and then the Free Will changes

903
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,720
everything

904
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:13,260
amongst all of it you can have a very

905
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,599
evil narcissist out there

906
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,599
because they're free will

907
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,060
is allowing it or you can have someone

908
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,859
using their free will to be a good

909
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,380
narcissist

910
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:26,700
it's so vast the understanding and

911
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,740
what's happening

912
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,320
one thing for sure

913
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,560
if someone cleans up their brain

914
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,720
and they repair neuron damage

915
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,859
and they were already a bad narcissist

916
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:44,099
they might become a good narcissist

917
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:46,579
all right Free Will is the key Serena

918
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,579
said it

919
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:50,220
so

920
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,460
first of all I better get this waffle

921
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,440

00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:54,060
it's dairy free

938
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,060
what else is it it's grain free

939
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:59,220
it's a potato waffle

940
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,500
it looks amazing

941
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,320
and I can't wait to

942
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,660
eat it so

943
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,619
crispy and hot I'm gonna put that in the

944
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,240
place

945
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm gonna pop this in now

946
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,960
so let's make another

947
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,960
drop that down

948
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,380
squeeze it down you guys

949
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,560
right I mean isn't that waffle doesn't

950
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:27,900
it look good I can't wait to put the

951
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,700
wild blueberry sauce on it to be honest

952
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,880
I'm actually really looking forward to

953
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,880
it

954
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,980
guys I see people asking I do have a

955
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,320
supplements directory on medical

956
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,240
medium.com where I have kitchen tools as

957
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,240
well on medical medium.com check it out

958
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,440
foreign so I'm just kind of pushing this

959
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:52,099
down squeezing that waffle out so it

960
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,099
actually moves around

961
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:58,579
okay

962
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:58,579
place it back over here

963
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,200
just want more than one waffle

964
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,579
how's that look you guys see that on

965
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,579
there

966
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,700
all right

967
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,260
all right all right let's go back to the

968
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,680
book too you guys I'm reading out a

969
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:27,900
brain saver right here

970
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,960
I'm excited about these books have you

971
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,760
had a chance to find them over 100

972
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,160
recipes I'm making some of the recipes

973
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,920
the wild blueberry recipes in here as

974
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,660
you can see Wild blueberry is a big part

975
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,700
of the books

976
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,700
in some way shape or form because

977
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,060
of the power of the wild blueberry it's

978
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,500
really incredible food it's a wild food

979
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,000
and so I want to talk about this one

980
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,140
thing because people still bring this up

981
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,700
they say

982
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,460
wait a minute is the Wyman's wild

983
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,079
blueberry juice is it organic so let's

984
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,160
cover that for a couple of seconds too

985
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,160
because I did it the other day

986
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:09,180
so here's how it works with organic

987
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,060
farming

988
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,500
the crops can't protect themselves they

989
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,700
don't have the ability to protect

990
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,220
themselves

991
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,920
so they have to be sprayed constantly

992
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,680
so when it comes down to organic crops

993
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,980
they have to spray the crops many times

994
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,839
three times a week in many cases

995
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,780
so keep that in mind

996
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,040
so when it comes down to organic food

997
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,760
organic food has to be continually

998
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,500
sprayed in order for you to get

999
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,380
something out of it

1000
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,820
if they don't continually spray

1001
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,099
you're not going to get the food you

1002
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:47,160
want it's not going to look good it's

1003
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:51,060
not going to be good now organic crops

1004
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:54,359
are sprayed with nicotine and copper

1005
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,839
keep that in mind Copper's toxic

1006
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:00,119
they're not using a trace mineral Copper

1007
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,920
from a fruit or a vegetable that

1008
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,579
naturally has it happens to be there

1009
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,140
they're using industrialized copper in

1010
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:11,099
the organic sprays

1011
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,359
with nicotine and other things like MSG

1012
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:15,359
now

1013
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:17,760
when they spray organic crops

1014
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,619
they're spraying those crops with

1015
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,900
pollinator killers

1016
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,780
that means the bees get injured

1017
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,980
and other pollinators get injured

1018
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:28,140
so

1019
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,060
every time someone hits me with that

1020
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:35,280
hole why isn't this wild food organic

1021
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:36,599
and that's that's a problem why is it

1022
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,640
organic

1023
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,180
I said the other day don't give me that

1024
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,680
holier than whatever thing about that

1025
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,319
because you just don't know the

1026
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,380
information so it's important so let's

1027
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,060
step into it a little bit further

1028
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,660
so

1029
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,760
okay so wild blueberries

1030
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,920
or wild food

1031
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,319
tends to itself

1032
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:07,319
almost always that means

1033
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:09,839
bugs don't come and hurt the wild food

1034
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:11,579
because the wild food will hurt the bug

1035
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,700
keep that in mind

1036
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:17,579
if there ever is a situation where there

1037
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,640
is a bug affecting a certain part

1038
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,640
of a field somewhere then yeah Wyman's

1039
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,700
will use a spray but they won't use a

1040
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,960
pollinator killer and then they test

1041
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,000
their berries

1042
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,900
and they test them out and they find

1043
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,859
their zero percent pesticide residue but

1044
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:42,599
here's the thing organic farmers don't

1045
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:46,079
test their food for you as a consumer to

1046
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,819
make sure you don't have any nicotine in

1047
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,660
your organic produce

1048
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:54,060
MSG in your organic produce and copper

1049
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:58,140
they're not testing for that they're

1050
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,720
under the blanket term organic produce

1051
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:03,900
keep that in mind too

1052
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,760
and so and then some of the people which

1053
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,339
is really crazy some of the people that

1054
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,619
will actually complain and say well why

1055
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:12,839
does wild blueberry juice is not organic

1056
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,480
that same person

1057
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:17,640
eat at a restaurant two weeks ago and

1058
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,880
had conventional sprayed food

1059
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:24,119
that was sprayed though sprayed to

1060
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,099
not like a wild food that really rarely

1061
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,680
gets sprayed and they tested for zero

1062
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:30,359
percent pesticide right instead they're

1063
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,980
in a restaurant somewhere traveling

1064
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:34,319
they're sitting there on their high

1065
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,240
horse saying how oh oh why blueberries

1066
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,980
aren't organic and they're sitting there

1067
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,380
in some restaurant eating two or three

1068
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,660
items in their dish that was completely

1069
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:45,300
conventional and highly sprayed

1070
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,119
so keep that in mind too there's a big

1071
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:52,319
difference between organic and wild wild

1072
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:55,380
is a food above organic no matter what

1073
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:57,839
wild is above organic and that's the

1074
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,260
incredible part of it all

1075
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:04,680
but organic produce is sprayed three

1076
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:07,200
times a week with pollinator killers

1077
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,319
and that's not helping the bees

1078
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,000
lyman's doesn't hurt their bees

1079
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,160
keep that in mind

1080
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,920
and they spray only when they need to

1081
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,839
rarely depending and when they do they

1082
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,400
monitor it and they don't use a

1083
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,859
pollinator killer

1084
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,319
and that's absolutely incredible because

1085
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:28,140
it's a wild food and it takes care of

1086
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:31,140
itself so this is like a really

1087
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,900
important education on organic food when

1088
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,560
I go to the store right

1089
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:41,160
and I see some organic produce

1090
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:43,200
I buy the organic produce but I don't

1091
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,339
buy it ignorantly

1092
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,440
I don't buy it that way I buy it going

1093
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:52,500
that's probably got a load of copper and

1094
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,359
MSG on it that's probably got a load of

1095
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,339
nicotine on it

1096
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,440
and I'm gonna wash my organic produce

1097
00:46:56,339 --> 00:47:01,980
when I bring it home because I know it's

1098
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,200
got nicotine residue MSG residue and

1099
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,940
copper residue I don't have to worry

1100
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,220
about that when I'm drinking my wild

1101
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,500
goober juice it's like freedom because

1102
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,900
it's wild food but when I go to the

1103
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,480
store that's what I well that's what I

1104
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,880
see I see food because I have I see

1105
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,619
everything right because that's that's

1106
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:23,460
just who I am

1107
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:25,859
and so I don't have blinders on I I'm

1108
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:29,160
not allowed to have blinders on I have

1109
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:32,099
to see everything for what it is

1110
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,960
Janessa says I love when aw shines truth

1111
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,520
through the brainwashing exactly

1112
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,520
brainwashing

1113
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,440
organic fields are so heavily Laden in

1114
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,160
nicotine and copper it is almost

1115
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,780
disturbing and disgusting but yet I

1116
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,520
still choose organic food because

1117
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,880
organic's better than

1118
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,060
standard conventional

1119
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:57,660
cultivated conventional produce organic

1120
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:59,819
is better than that produce while food

1121
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:03,359
is different it's above all of them

1122
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:07,560
while food is above conventional produce

1123
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,540
and above organic produce it's above

1124
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,760
both of them

1125
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:14,160
and that's how it works

1126
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,839
really important to know because I know

1127
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,960
that people get they get on their holy

1128
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:21,780
horse and they're just like let's slay

1129
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,940
aw let's take them down because he

1130
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:26,099
doesn't know like what and they just

1131
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,839
want to take me down it's like oh all

1132
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:29,940
you're doing is just like

1133
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,220
being like ridiculous because you don't

1134
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,260
know what's going on and that's how it

1135
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:37,800
works

1136
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:41,599
and I'm gonna have a

1137
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,599
nice little shot right here

1138
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,440
all right

1139
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I'm gonna crack another bottle open

1140
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,220
while we're looking into stuff you guys

1141
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,599
I got I gotta start making a blueberry

1142
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,260
sausage a little bit but I want to make

1143
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,260
another waffle

1144
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,020
all right you guys

1145
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,280
all I have to do is take the time to

1146
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,660
fully explain it's hard to keep up with

1147
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,839
all the debunking

1148
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,720
I already worked 24 7.

1149
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,400
I'm already working 24 7 right trying to

1150
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,460
get out free information do everything I

1151
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,859
need to do and so it's hard to always

1152
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,160
try to teach and explain and debunk

1153
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:25,020
stuff misinformation it's so hard to

1154
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,780
constantly do that

1155
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:30,060
but what you'll notice is people get

1156
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,319
hurt along the way right they get hurt

1157
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,599
along the way

1158
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,319
because they'll get scared about Misty

1159
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,000
something they'll get some

1160
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,040
misinformation and then they lose a

1161
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,960
chance to even get what they need

1162
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,940
and I can't answer every you know

1163
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,900
everyone's

1164
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,900
you know attack

1165
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,200
I mean I can't tell you how many fake

1166
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:54,660
stories there are

1167
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,400
how much fake crap was made up about me

1168
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,119
out there

1169
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,819
and that's how Darkness works

1170
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,160
they're the ultimate just whatever

1171
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:07,859
and there's not enough time

1172
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,119
in my day or in my week to just battle

1173
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,540
all the

1174
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,319
silly stuff Ariel says calm down ew all

1175
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,060
right

1176
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,200
but calm down

1177
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,880
but yeah

1178
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,680
the thing is it's important to know

1179
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,660
because you know when I see that all the

1180
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,240
time like it's not organic it's like

1181
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,500

wild blueberry juice

1326
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,460

1327
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,940
just add it straight to this

1328
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,940

1354
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,140
holidays like even if it's just holding

1355
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,839

1356
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,339
right holding a glass of of

1357
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,319

1450
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:07,079

1451
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:09,619
I like more wild blueberry sauce the

it's not ladled in fat

1460
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:36,900
and I say that really because what

1461
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:40,140
happens is people combine all that fat

1462
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,359
on top of everything and in everything

1463
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:44,099
none of that's in here it's a potato

1464
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:45,960

01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:48,660

1468
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,640

1469
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:59,160

1470
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:03,480
