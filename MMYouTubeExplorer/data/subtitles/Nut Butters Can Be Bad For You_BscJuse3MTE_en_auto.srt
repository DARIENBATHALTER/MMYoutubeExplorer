are betraying people bottom line see

25
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,479
that peanut butter that oil is not from

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,960
those peanuts see that almond butter

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,880
that oil is not from those almonds you

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,759
can't see this is it isn't clear but

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,960
it's an unopen tahini and the oil on top

30
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,720
of that unopen tahini is not from those

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,799
seeds I hate to give you the hard truth

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,040
but it's not this is one of the best

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,840
lessons you guys can have because the

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,520
oils that are placed in all the nut

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,520
Butters declines your health this is a

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,520
tahini right

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,600
here

38
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:35,600
take a look that is straight oil and

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,960
that's not from your sesame seeds this

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,439
is part of why people can't heal they

41
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,159
think they're doing something good for

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,520
themselves but they don't heal this is

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,320
why vegans don't heal and they go back

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,880
to eating eggs this is why vegetarians

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,960
and people who are really mindful about

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,040
their health this is part of why they

47
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,079
don't heal it's simple things like this

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,200
that they don't know that is pure

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,600
straight oil but not from those sesame

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,880
seeds in all the tahini bottles and jars

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,880
that you you guys have is added oil that

52
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,880
comes from someplace else it's bulk

53
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,840
cheap lowgrade rancid oil it's in all

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
your nut Butters and your tahinis the

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,720
oil you're looking at is not from those

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,319
nuts or those seeds they're putting old

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,560
rancid oil that comes from bulk nuts

58
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:19,879
from around the planet it depreciates

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,200
your health it's not good for your heart

60
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,599
it's not good if you have chronic

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,160
illness people are eating all the peanut

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,879
butters all the almond butters all the

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,599
tahinis all the cashew Butters all the

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,000
hazelnut Butters and don't realize it

65
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,680
they're drinking oil that's declining

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,440
and taking down their health and they

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,440
don't even know it this is the death by

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,120
a th000 cuts and that's why it is

69
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,159
absolutely critical you learn how to

70
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,440
make a nut butter what is the point of

71
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,319
companies to put oil in their nut

72
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,640
Butters confused why they add it because

73
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,040
they use less nuts which cost the nut

74
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,760
butter companies a lot of money they use

75
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,560
less nuts but bring in cheap bulk oil

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,480
that cost them pennies pennies and then

77
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,640
they mark up the price of your nut

78
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,200
butter jar stick it on the Shelf at

79
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:10,519
Whole Foods or whatever food store and

80
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,760
you pay for ranet old oil you can't be

81
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,599
sure that they're just adding plain old

82
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,599
oil the oil could have garbage in it

83
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,280
crap in it it's bulk rancid old oils in

84
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,560
every nut butter out

85
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,080
there that's what nut butter is supposed

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,200
to look like right there mm1 1500 boom

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
why should we even care about all that

88
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,080
added oil I'll tell you why diminishes

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,080
your health lowers your immune system

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,560
burdens your liver and your heart heavy

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,200
on the liver and pancreas so what I'm

92
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,120
doing is putting it in these little jars

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
and then I put a lid on it you might be

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
able to see this on a closeup too it

95
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,280
looks really cool so I'm packing it down

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
with my hands my hands are clean I

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,040
wasn't out at the post office or at the

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,400
store or grocery store and I was opening

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,000
up all kinds of doors out there and had

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,560
my hands on the shopping cart and

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,159
carriages and now I'm putting my hands

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,640
in here so I can put all

103
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,439
those little buggies that I picked up

104
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,799
somewhere on my hands in here but no my

106
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,600
lid on

107
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,579
it boom when you make your own nut

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,840
