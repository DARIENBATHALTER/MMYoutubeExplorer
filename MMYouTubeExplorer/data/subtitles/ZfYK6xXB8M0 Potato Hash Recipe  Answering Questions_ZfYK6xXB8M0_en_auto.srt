this isn't the book itself but this is

248
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,240
my manuscript right here

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,680
um before i hand it in to the publisher

about epstein-barr

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,440
in the new book so i'm reading that

256
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,360
question right there

257
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
there's a depression chapter really

258
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,920
important one

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
migraines and headaches chapter thyroid

260
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,720
chapter

261
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,440
additional information there shingles

262
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,680
chapter and

263
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
like what happens is that people didn't

264
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
even know what shingles even cost like

265
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
what conditions

266
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,959
they just thought it was a rash and that

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
was it like a rash and that was all it

268
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,959
was

269
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,399
and shingles is a lot more than that

270
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,000
because shingles causes trigeminal

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,120
neuralgia now that's medical medium

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
information that's

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
that came from that book and and before

274
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
it colitis

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
anybody with colitis you know that's the

276
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,000
shingles virus that causes colitis

277
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
so that's something there that is

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
important to know

279
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
sciatic pain you know this whole sciatic

280
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
pain the nerve pain the back pain people

281
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
get

282
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
when they're just they're hurting

283
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
they've got the pain down the leg but

284
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
yet

285
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
but yet it shouldn't be causing them a

286
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,959
problem they don't have that much of a

287
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,760
problem with their disc or their lower

288
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
spine

289
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
and even when they get their lower spine

290
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
adjusted or chiropractor says the lower

291
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,760
spine looks good in all this stuff

292
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,279
it's it's still inflamed they can't walk

293
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,720
they got the worst sciatic pain that's

294
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,560
the shingles too so i broke the

295
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
information out about that

296
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,839
being shingles and i talk about the

297
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,640
different types of shingles and rashes

298
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,760
um so it's really really a power power

299
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,800
packed

300
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,920
book um multiple sclerosis i talk about

301
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
that too

302
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,800
and so when you get the new edition

303
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,880
revised and expanded

304
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,320
it's a game changer i put a whole

305
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
another book into this

306
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,160
it's really incredible so i want to talk

307
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,320
about lyme disease too a little bit

308
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,399
in a little bit right now i'm cooking

309
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,480
this up and

310
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,240
lyme disease is there's really a tragic

311
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,680
history with lyme disease

312
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:51,360
and i expose that tragic history

313
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,000
um and talk about how you know people

314
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,480
were

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
taken advantage of they dumped they

316
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,120
dumped antibiotics in people

317
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,920
just hundreds of thousands of people

318
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,160
back in the old

319
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,160
in the old days back 20 years ago 30

320
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,399
years ago they still do it now they just

321
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,680
pounded people with antibiotics made

322
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
their symptoms worse

323
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
pushed him into the worst neurological

324
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,399
lyme conditions

325
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,760
killed a few yeah killed a few

326
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,079
so the history of lyme is really great

327
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,440
it's terrible it's like the negligence

328
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
the mistakes made by

329
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
a lot of the old lyme doctors still

330
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,720
still being made with the new lyme

331
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,920
doctors

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,040
many of them and

333
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,880
the the wake

334
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,200
of hell and just just

335
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,200
negligence of people with lyme disease

336
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,959
being told it's bacterial

337
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,360
being convinced it's bacterial because

338
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,959
big pharma wants to sell the drugs

339
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,120
and has really destroyed a lot of lives

340
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,079
and i exposed it for the first time in

341
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,519
our history

342
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,959
medical medium book one and so um

343
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
that information is in here in the

344
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,279
revised and expanded

345
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
and i also release the truth about lyme

346
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,519
disease

347
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,519
how it's viral and

348
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,959
that original book medical medium book

349
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,680
one you guys

350
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,240

351
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,560
world it's the most popular health book

352
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,160
ever in history by the way so this book

353
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,040
right here is the most popular health

354
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,399
book

355
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,279
in all health history so um for years

356
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,000
running now

357
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,839
and because i expose the truth about

358
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
lyme disease how it's viral so what

359
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,480
happened though the power of that

360
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120
what it did was it forced the medical

361
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,680
communities it forced

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
uh science of research to have to take

363
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
lyme disease out of the bacterial

364
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,399
category

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
so just so you know even though there's

366
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,000
still some some

367
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,079
lyme doctors trying to test for still

368
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
some lyme doctors trying to test for uh

369
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,480
lyme bacteria

370
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,920
science and research above the lyme

371
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
doctors have moved it out of the

372
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,440
bacterial

373
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
category so big pharma doesn't think

374
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,000
it's

375
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,760
bacteria anymore they put it in

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
autoimmune and the reason why they did

377
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
that

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
is because of medical medium books and

379
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
information because so many doctors

380
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
follow medical medium books around the

381
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,399
world

382
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:17,279
so um i'm gonna put the lid on here

383
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,399
this is what i'm gonna do

384
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
cook that up a little bit i'm going to

385
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,720
make the heavy metal detox smoothie

386
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,399
what happens with people with lyme

387
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
disease is they'll have they'll be high

388
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,560
in toxic heavy metals

389
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,760
and that's a thing anybody with chronic

390
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,079
fatigue syndrome

391
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,839
lupus chronic fatigue syndrome lupus

392
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis they're

393
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,279
high in heavy metals

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
people with multiple sclerosis symptoms

395
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
neurological symptoms

396
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
high in toxic heavy metals and so metals

397
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
are a big

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,279
part of it it's not just pathogens like

399
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,320
viruses like

400
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,040
i've taught about all these years it's

401
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
um the combination of toxic heavy metals

402
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,959
and

403
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,800
pathogens um so that that's that's why

404
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
the heavy metal detox smoothie is so

405
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,480
critical and so important and that heavy

406
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,279
metal detox smoothie

407
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,279

i got that so wild blueberries are

416
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,399
really

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,240
an essential part of this smoothie

418
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,320
keep that in mind really really

419
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,199
important part of that smoothie

420
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
like really critical so we got that in

421
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,759
there that's one thing there

422
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,759
and i'm gonna put a couple of bananas in

423
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,199
there

424
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,560
that's what i'm gonna do so

425
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,399
you guys just got on here i was talking

426
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,440
about medical medium book one

427
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,320
but they're revised expanded

428
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,160
talking about toxic heavy metals this

429
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
information in this heavy metal detox

430
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,680
movie has healed people around the world

431
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,120
adhd autism focus and concentration

432
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,480
problems ocd

433
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,480
the medical medium book one

434
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,639
had the smoothie in there the heavy

435
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,160
metal detox smoothie so

436
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,320
ptsd that too so we got the bananas in

437
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,839
there we got the wild blueberries

438
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
and then i'm going to put some cilantro

439
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
in here too

440
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,560
because that's one of the key critical

441
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,720
pieces

442
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,399
now in order to get metals out of

443
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
somebody and get them get

444
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,880
metals out properly you got to have some

445
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
other critical key pieces so

446
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,560
a spirulina that's a must but what i've

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
learned

448
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
about products out there is that if you

449
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
don't

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
have the right kind of product the right

451
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,680
thing is not going to happen

452
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,519
that's just naturally what goes on so

453
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
this is a spirulina the only one i trust

454
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
right now on the market

455
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,560
it's the only one and i'm not sponsored

456
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,680
just so you know

457
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,279
so i'm not sponsored by the company um

458
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,600
but this is the spirulina so this is the

459
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,680
vibragi spirulina vias and victor i am

460
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,480
as in mary e-r-g-y

461
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,559
and this is critic a critical part

462
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,600
of getting the metals out corella

463
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,799
doesn't work

464
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,959
never did corella is toxic it's got

465
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,799
problems it doesn't remove metals

466
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,959
i recommend anybody who's doing corolla

467
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,280
in my personal opinion i would never do

468
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
it

469
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,839
i talked about that for years and not

470
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,959
just any spirulina

471
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,439
so what you'll see is i used to support

472
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,600
pacific spirulina because it was the

473
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,520
decent stuff that was out at the time

474
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,799
since then it's been a lot of years this

475
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,960
is the best stuff

476
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,000
that's out there now that just

477
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,240
completely

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,520
rolls over any other spirulina so it's

479
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,799
got to be in the

480
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,880
smoothie and it matters what kind

481
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,200
you can get a really bad spirulina

482
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,919
really cheap spirulina or a low quality

483
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,000
one

484
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
and then we get in trouble so that's a

485
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
whole other thing

486
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,000
um so i'm going to pop some of this

487
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,120
spirulina in here for a second then i

488
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
got to watch over the

489
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,679
stir fry there so i'm doing the heavy

490
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,160
metal detox smoothie while cooking a

491
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
recipe

492
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
just going to move this around so it

493
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,160
doesn't stick this is cooking up nice

494
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,200
right here i don't think you guys can

495
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,880
see

496
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,039
put the pan back on there we go um

497
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,640
so just talked about the spirulina

498
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,039
critical part of getting toxic heavy

499
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,760
metals out of the brain

500
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,120
out of the liver in my opinion and from

501
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,240
the information i got from spirit of

502
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,559
compassion

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,000
and the heavy metal detox smoothie has

504
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,640
really really

505
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,559
not just changed lives it's saved

506
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
countless lives at this point now around

507
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,520
the world it's becoming

508
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,320
a staple around the world um

509
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,120
and i talk about that in of course the

510
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,960
revised

511
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,400
and expanded medical meeting book one so

512
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
you know guys you know what's funny it'd

513
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,919
be different if none of that happened

514
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,919
it'd be different if lives weren't saved

515
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,360
if millions of lives weren't healed and

516
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
saved throughout the years with these

517
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,200
books and this

518
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,039
information and the smoothie and

519
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
everything else and then i'd be sitting

520
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,600
here like

521
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,120
other people in the health field toting

522
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,679
things in toting products and tote and

523
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,919
stuff but

524
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,280
no track record of of thousands and

525
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,280
thousands and tens of thousands and

526
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,320
hundreds of thousands of lives saved

527
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,240
no track record of that you know of skin

528
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,480
conditions getting better and

529
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,600
you know adhd completely disappearing

530
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
and you know

531
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,360
migraines disappearing and stuff and a

532
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
medical medium information has that

533
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,400
track record

534
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
and i'm actually really proud to say it

535
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
because

536
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,919
it's incredible because no other health

537
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,320
community or no other health communities

538
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
no other health authors have that track

539
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,760
record of that many people healed better

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,840
recovered

541
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,120
with the tools or anything and but what

542
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,880
they do is they take medical medium

543
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
information they take the tidbits

544
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
and they sprinkle other stuff around it

545
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,799
so they try to get people some results

546
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,039
by taking

547
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,039
mm info throughout the years this is the

548
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,320
barley grass juice powder

549
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,600
here's the here's another thing about

550
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,280
the barley grass cheese first this is

551
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,160
the vimergy barley grass juice powder v

552
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,360
is in victor i

553
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,000
am as in mary er gy

554
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,960
okay and same thing with the spirulina

555
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,760
so

556
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,440
now you can use a barley grass cheese

557
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,520
powder doesn't mean it's gonna work

558
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
and grab onto the metals it doesn't mean

559
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,120
it's going to help assist

560
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,120
getting the metals out keep that in mind

561
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,960
a lot of people use barley grass

562
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,400
doesn't work at all so that's something

563
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,280

565
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
it's barley grass cheese powder i just

566
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,280

barley grass juice better it's another

569
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,280
essential ingredient

570
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,159
to getting metals safely out you can't

571
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,440

572
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,080

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,240
metals

574
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,559
out with just cilantro by itself so much

575
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,679
just won't do the job

576
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,320
it has to be a certain blend of

577
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,120
ingredients i talk about so

578
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,919

so um so this is the dolls right here

586
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,240
that's another essential ingredient you

587
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
don't need a lot of it you can just do a

588
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
nice little strip

589
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,559
do anywhere from teaspoon to a

590
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,080
tablespoon okay

591
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,400
but i'm doing a couple strips in there

592
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
and that heavy metal detox smoothie

593
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,760
so i got that in there like i put the

594
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,320
cilantro in there you got the wild

595
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,640
blueberries in there okay and then

596
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,559
what i do is the wild blueberry powder

597
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
all right it's a vimergy wild blueberry

598
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
powder right there

599
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,360
and what i call this is blue gold is

600
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,880
what i call it

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,200
so i put that in there too additionally

602
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
now regular cultivator blueberries

603
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,520
cannot

604
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,960
remove metals cannot remove

605
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,039
metals i repeat a regular

606
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,440
it does even if it's organic a regular

607
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,640
blueberry that's organic

608
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,360
cultivated regular blueberry organic

609
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,120
will not assist in getting toxic heavy

610
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
metals out of the liver or the brain or

611
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,600
anywhere out of your body

612
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,520
it has to be a wild blueberry that gets

613
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,159
the metals out but

614
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,320
it needs also to have the company of the

615
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,039
cilantro in the same blend

616
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000

617
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,080

619
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,919

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,760
adhd metals play a role

861
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,279
and what people are doing with their

862
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
metals is they're getting them out of

863
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,080
their brain they're getting them out of

864
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,360
their liver

865
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,200
this is a big part of this book

866
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,880
originally just letting you know you

867
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,880
feel that onions trigger migraines

868
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:28,080
no but caffeine does i know that

869
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,360
caffeine triggers migraines um

870
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,440
that's a big one right there for

871
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,440

872
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,960
it's like i got a whole migraines

873
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,000
chapter in this book too

874
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,000
by the way and it all depends like so

875
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,480
is it you never had a migraine before

876
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,399
ever and then the onion causes it or it

877
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,600
gets triggered randomly with all kinds

878
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,360
of stuff like

879
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,960
you know stress triggering it and it

880
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,240
happens to be the day the onions are

881
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,799
happening or

882
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,880
something else trigger it or you know or

883
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,480
dehydrate it that triggers off migraines

884
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,519
i talk about how migraines get triggered

885
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,080
off

886
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,679
toxic heavy metals viruses cause

887
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,240
migraines i talked about that

888
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,679
and revised and expanded um book right

889
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,039
here the medical medium book

890
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,359
his link is in the description so you

891
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,639
get the right one chocolate's a migraine

892
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,159
creator

893
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,240
you can have chocolate two days ago and

894
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,800
have a migraine two days later

895
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,399
um and then what that migraine is is

896
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,760
chocolate withdrawal so it's caffeine

897
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,200
withdrawal from chocolate

898
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,800
so people don't realize is they go

899
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,200
through chocolate withdrawal

900
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,560
every other day every two three days and

901
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,879
they get triggered with all kinds of

902
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,879
stuff

903
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,159
they get triggered with everything so

904
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,639
that's important too

905
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,839
it's amazing that we're taught to eat

906
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,359
chocolate

907
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,839
and which is fine you could eat

908
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,000
chocolate all you want just know

909
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,280
that it's going to just create it's all

910
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,119
part of the addiction

911
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,560
you know it's it's really is the the

912
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:50,159
caffeine addiction this is almost done

913
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,520
and i'm about to plate it pretty soon

914
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,520
put a little parsley on top

915
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,720
if you're really hyper hyper

916
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,839
hypersensitive and you're cutting raw

917
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,240
onions

918
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,880
and the sulfur from the onion is so

919
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,200
cleansing

920
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,720
it's possible that could if you already

921
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,079
got migraines going going that you can

922
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,640

something going on from that but it's

924
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680
it's

925
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,920
not toxic but you know what triggers off

926
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
migraines really bad air fresheners

927
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,119

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,599
you can just put a couple of sprigs of

967
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,320
parsley on this if that's what you want

968
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,240

975
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,880
out of the 45 recipes

976
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,480

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
so you guys can see it hopefully you see

979
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
that

980
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,119
and

981
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,760
i'm hoping it kind of looks like that

982
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
right there

983
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,960
that's just look that's not what the

984
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,720
photo looks like in the in the real book

985
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,160
that you get this is just my manuscript

986
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,839
i'm just letting you know

987
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,839
that's what this is my manuscript so

988
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:07,359
this medical medium new edition

989
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:10,480
so and that's the recipe i just made

990
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,560
looks good does it look okay it's piping

991
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,119
hot i'll tell you that much right now

992
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:21,359
so you want to taste it i saw that um

993
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,640
so so cammy asks what candles are okay

994
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,800
it has to be a candle that has no

995
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,440
fragrances no fragrances

996
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,680
maybe a candle that maybe have an

997
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,320
essential oil of thyme or

998
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,240
a little bit essential oil or rosemary

999
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,000
essential oil of oregano

1000
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,839
that could be okay something like that

1001
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,920
but you but what happens is with

1002
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,680
essential oil candles they also put

1003
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,520
toxic stuff in it too so it says

1004
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,040
essential oils essential oil candles but

1005
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
it's also toxic they use toxic

1006
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,920
fragrances

1007
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,280
just keep in mind about that scented

1008
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,720
candles are probably one of the most

1009
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,480
destructive

1010
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,480
um to the body and it's crazy what

1011
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,839
happens is you'll see out there

1012
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,680
as you'll see perfumes colognes scented

1013
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,440
candles uh air fresheners are so

1014
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,920
toxic right and they're so toxic

1015
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,599
and at the same time there's all these

1016
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,359
people in the health field using them so

1017
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,440
you got all these people on instagram

1018
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
all these people on youtube and they're

1019
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,760
so health conscious and spiritually

1020
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,960
conscious

1021
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,560
and they're showing their health

1022
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,160
products and they're showing their like

1023
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,760
fresh meals or whatever they got

1024
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,680
whatever they're showing and eating

1025
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,440
and as they're doing that they're also

1026
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,400
burning scented candles in their house

1027
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,240
they're doing that

1028
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
they're they're they have air fresheners

1029
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,640
going on they got perfumes colognes

1030
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,320
all kinds of stuff like that and i know

1031
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,040
because a friend of mine

1032
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,640
um walked into their friend's house

1033
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,320
after not seeing him for a while with

1034
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,400
everything going on right now

1035
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,839
and went to go see him and this is a

1036
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,320
person that's an influencer out there

1037
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,200
doing stuff went to go see him and

1038
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,520
hit like a brick wall of just scented

1039
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,839
candles and all of that and it was so

1040
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,359
toxic like and that stuff is so

1041
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,079
dangerous so it seems like everybody's a

1042
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,760
health expert

1043
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,200
out there but they're burning their

1044
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,800
scented candles they're doing this

1045
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,000
they're doing that they're tanking their

1046
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
caffeine

1047
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,400
they're teaching other people how to use

1048
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,720
caffeine to get hooked on caffeine

1049
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,560
with the teas and the matcha tea and the

1050
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,839
addiction of all of it and the caffeine

1051
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,119
addiction and the coffee addiction

1052
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,240
coffee drinks and the chocolate

1053
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,160
addiction and

1054
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,920
it's like that's what that's how it

1055
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,280
works out there and

1056
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,359
sure you can burn all the scented

1057
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,640
candles you want i mean go ahead and you

1058
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,040
can do all the caffeine you want i'm

1059
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,960
just saying that these are troublemakers

1060
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,560
and then all the new clothing right now

1061
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,440
when you order new clothing any kind of

1062
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,319
new clothing

1063
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,720
it comes saturated there's very few

1064
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,200
articles of clothing that come

1065
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,720
without smell now it's saturated with

1066
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,359
fungicides perfumes

1067
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,800
colognes and people should start

1068
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,480
complaining because

1069
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,400
what the chemical companies are doing

1070
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,880
right now is they're bombarding everyone

1071
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,720
they're

1072
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
they're you know how you know women are

1073
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,599
worried about hormones

1074
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,520
one of the big hormone disruptors

1075
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,359
is all the chemicals and the scented

1076
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,560
candles the air fresheners

1077
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,440
the detergents the chemicals and fabric

1078
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,079
softeners

1079
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,400
the chemicals in all the new clothing

1080
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,119
are hormone destroyers they're just

1081
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
hormone

1082
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,400
destroyers so what women are falling

1083
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,839
victim to right now without knowing it

1084
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,319
they don't know this

1085
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,960
but they're being taught to like douse

1086
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,920
everything with

1087
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,040
perfume and clones stuff is highly toxic

1088
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,880
and

1089
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,079
actually throws all the hormones off in

1090
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,280
the body so then you got to go to the

1091
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,119
doctor and you got to get

1092
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,720
constantly get your hormones figured out

1093
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,160
and balanced and checked and

1094
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,319
meanwhile it's all this stuff just

1095
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,720
destroying you know the

1096
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,760
it's destroying the very glands that

1097
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,240
produce hormones in the body too so

1098
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,560
fabric softeners laundry detergents

1099
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,160
colognes perfumes scented candles

1100
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,319
this is a big deal and there's heavy

1101
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,560
metals in all of this stuff so

1102
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,400
that's why it's critical to be doing

1103
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,880
like the heavy metal detox movie

1104
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,160
and but you'll see people doing spinoffs

1105
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
they'll be like i'm doing a heavy metal

1106
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,599
detox smoothie they won't say a medical

1107
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,560
medium anymore and they'll be like

1108
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,599
i'm putting corella in here i'm putting

1109
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,960
this in there

1110
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,720
and it's not even going to help anybody

1111
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,920
has to be the right

1112
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,359
blend it's critical um

1113
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,480
has to be the right brent blend it has

1114
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,079
to be quick like i said if you're going

1115
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,040
to do the heavy metal detox smoothie if

1116
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,520
you want

1117
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,280
to be like looking out for yourself if

1118
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,720
you want to make sure you're protecting

1119
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,880
