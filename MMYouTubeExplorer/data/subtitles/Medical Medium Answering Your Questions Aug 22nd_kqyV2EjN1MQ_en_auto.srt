my real thoughts about coffee matcha tea

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,520
chocolate the caffeine industry the

38
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,840
caffeine this

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,720
industry just they really want to

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,119
control

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
people and that's their like that's

42
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,799
their mission

43
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,400
it's get people addicted get people

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,080
hooked and own their soul

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
that's what the caffeine industry wants

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
to do and i'm not talking about really

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,880
good heartache good intentioned

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
people who start up you know a coffee

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,840
shop

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
a coffee business um you know whatever

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,400
they want to sell a really good matcha

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,200
tea i'm

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,119
not talking about that that kind of

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
thing where it's that i'm talking about

55
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
the industry above them that gets

56
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
them addicted too it's it's an addiction

57
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
caffeine's a drug

58
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
okay it sounds harsh it's all good but

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,159
what happens is women get hair thinning

60
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,640
and it comes from years of caffeine not

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
every

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
not everybody the hair thinning can

63
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,759
happen for a few other reasons a couple

64
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,240
of other reasons but

65
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
but for the most part the caffeinated

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
beverages

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,760
the chocolate what it does is it beats

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,239
down women's adrenals and women

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
need their adrenals super strong for

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,840
pregnancies

71
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,720
for birthing babies for the reproductive

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
system

73
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,160
for the fact that they handle so much

74
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
and they do more do more

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,879
they do so much more than even men do in

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
so many cases women are actually

77
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
you know they have it much harder in

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
many ways um i mean i know women they

79
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,879
have

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,800
20 jobs i mean 20 jobs and

81
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
and they're doing 20 jobs from the

82
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
minute they wake up in the morning to

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,319
the minute they go to bed

84
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,760
they're raising children taking care of

85
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
their family they're working you know

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,920
two jobs they're doing all these things

87
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
combined

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,239
and the caffeine is kind of like it's a

89
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
scary thing because it burns out the

90
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,440
adrenals it gets

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,480
it actually starts to beat down the

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
adrenals

93
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,800
hormone blend the one that keeps hair on

94
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,239
women's heads

95
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,159
and and so you know caffeine is a big

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,400
part of that another thing it does it

97
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,480
causes chronic dehydration over time

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
it beats down the liver it breaks down

99
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
the liver it gets it weak it gets its

100
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
stagnant and sluggish

101
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,640
um and it causes adrenaline surges for

102
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
people to be in fight and flight every

103
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
day so that's that's the whole thing so

104
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,560
what do i think about coffee

105
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
if you're look if you've got nothing

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
going on there's no so you have no

107
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,280
symptoms you have nothing wrong

108
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,720
you feel great everything's good and you

109
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,760
want to do coffee drinks and you want to

110
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
do much tea and you want to eat

111
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
chocolate vine i mean

112
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,239
it's you know it's not that i'm like

113
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,159
freaking out or anything about it

114
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
it's just if you got fatigue if you have

115
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,599
symptoms if you got

116
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,879
some some brain fog if you have issues

117
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,799
of all kinds of different kinds let's

118
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
get down to the bottom of those issues

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,680
let's get down to the bottom of fatigue

120
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,319
and brain fog and anxiety and depression

121
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
and you know and but the chains of

122
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
addiction

123
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,560
or the the caffeine industry it's a

124
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
monster

125
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,480
that has shareholders at the top and

126
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,159
those shareholders want to make sure

127
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,760
every girl and every woman every

128
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,120
man too is addicted in every way

129
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,640
possible to caffeine that's the industry

130
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
they want them all hooked and they

131
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,120
wanted to own the person's soul

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,439
and they wanted to the caffeine industry

133
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,239
knows that if they can just control

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,519
women

135
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,199
on a caffeine addiction they got them

136
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
they're set they're set and they can

137
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,720
they can make trillions off of

138
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
off of caffeine you know caffeine from

139
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,520
there on out it's it's really

140
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,320
it's a really important topic um lisa

141
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,040
says coffee is my biggest obstacle

142
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,880
because it's it's it's a tough one it's

143
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,919
like it's it's an addiction

144
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,320
and i listen i don't blame you one bit

145
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,720
you need to know this like when when the

146
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,479
industries get us hooked on something

147
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,479
and they don't teach us otherwise and

148
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,919
they don't give us opportunities and

149
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,360
we don't get these opportunities to find

150
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,360
out what's going on with why we have

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
brain fog or why we got fatigue and why

152
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
we don't feel good

153
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
and the industries don't want us to know

154
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,440
how to fix those things they want us

155
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
hooked on that coffee so lisa it's not

156
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
like

157
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,039
it's not like it's your fault on any

158
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
level and plus it tastes good when you

159
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
put sugar in it

160
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,560
and you put you know you know if you put

161
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,400
sugar in coffee and you put whatever

162
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
soy cream or soy you would have soy

163
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
creamer or cream in it or whatever you

164
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,039
want to do

165
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,160
it tastes good right and so that's the

166
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
whole thing on its own

167
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
but but it's not your fault if it's your

168
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
biggest obstacle

169
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,840
you're a good person you didn't do

170
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,479
anything wrong not at all

171
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,639

that's not it that's not the people i'm

194
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
talking about above them

195
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,160
is this hierarchy is this evil giant

196
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,080
and that evil giant is downright

197
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,319
despicable and

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,039
that giant needs women especially women

199
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,880
hooked on coffee they want them hooked

200
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,319
on caffeine they want them hooked on

201
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
you know the teas they want them hooked

202
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,479
on everything and

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
it's really sad and they want to own

204
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
women's souls

205
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
and that's what that industry wants to

206
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
do i know this for a fact

207
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
this is what they do and um

208
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
and it's you know it's one of those

209
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,440
things

210
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
hey brandi you're awesome too um there

211
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
you know

212
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
so i briefly saw something you talked

213
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,680
about with the dangers of diatomaceous

214
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
earth by the way

215
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
so diastomace diatomaceous earth

216
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
particles

217
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,680
um and someone said i didn't know this

218
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,000
but i took it i took it for about two

219
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
weeks

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,240
straight as did my sister now we both

221
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
have issues with their joints being way

222
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
too loose and they feel like they could

223
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
easily just come out of their sockets

224
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,080
plus my knees start to feel like they're

225
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
tearing for no reason just

226
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
walking and standing makes them hard

227
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,160
start start to tear

228
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
um have to sometimes wear a knee brace

229
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,599
now shoulders hurt

230
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,680
and everything pops will this ever fully

231
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,160
heal is there something i can do

232
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
with the whole diatomaceous earth thing

233
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
and

234
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
and the side effects so that's

235
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,360
diatomaceous i've

236
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,400
i've i've been anti-diatomaceous earth

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,759
particles from the beginning um not a

238
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
big fan of it

239
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
from you know what i've seen and what

240
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,960
spirit of compassion some

241
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
say soc right spirit of compassion has

242
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,840
told me is

243
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,080
it's just not great for the immune

244
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,840
system not great for the immune system

245
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
and it's hard on the digestive tract so

246
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
it's those two things here so if you

247
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,960
have something going on like

248
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,000
an epstein barr and your sister has an

249
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,599
epstein bar

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
and you've got the sepsis bar sitting

251
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
inside of you and it's probably about to

252
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,879
come out and do its thing

253
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,400
and low-grade viral infection i talk

254
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
about you know and cleanse the heal when

255
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,199
people have the epstein bars they have

256
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
fibromyalgia and they have all these

257
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,840
other

258
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,039
you know joint pain and all these

259
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
different symptoms

260
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
and you take the diatomaceous earth

261
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
particles or you take you know what

262
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
however in what form or you breed them

263
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,919
in

264
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
it it it kind of it's hard on the immune

265
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,560
system

266
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,160
and when it's hard on the immune system

267
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,360
anything else can creep up

268
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,680
anything can creep up so um everybody

269
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,519
has a chance to heal everybody has an

270
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,039

that every now and then too

278
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
but yeah there's but but i just i always

lot of things the caffeine i tell them

283

the caffeine industry

306
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
it which is really sad is even when you

307
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
know you're addicted

308
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800

they're sucked into the madness

316
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,959
to the industries controlling them in

317
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,279

really find something out of that they

352
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
really like but i can talk about it here

353
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,800
on

354
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
what i know about it and what spirit of

355
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,160
compassion has taught me about it and

356
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,360
what i teach doctors about it too

357
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,440
is that what's happening is with with it

358
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,480
it's an adrenaline response is what

359
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,560
occurs so when you get stung by a bee

360
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,640
when you get stung by a bee on your leg

361
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
or on on your body somewhere and usually

362
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,680
with

363
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,160
uh with with b therapy when they do this

364
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,240
is

365
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
they you sting the thigh or you sting

366
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
the knee

367
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,639
and in the arm too but but what happens

368
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,279
is it prompts the adrenals

369
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
to flood so instantly your adrenals are

370
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,360
flooding and flooding and flooding it's

371
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,600
it's a it's a serious adrenal surge

372
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
when you get stung by a bee adrenaline

373
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,279
is pouring in

374
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,360
just from your adrenals okay and so when

375
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,160
that's happening you guys

376
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
what you do is you get steroid relief so

377
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,720
you're getting steroidal relief

378
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,040
so that's how the therapy works so when

379
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,279
you have neurological conditions

380
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,639
like any kind of neurological condition

381
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,000
you have aches and pains

382
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,320
tingles and numbness ticks and spasms

383
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,360
you know like you you know uh limb

384
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
weaknesses

385
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
you know people with multiple sclerosis

386
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,720
or they have ms or they have als or they

387
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
have other kind of condition whatever it

388
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
is

389
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,720
and they're doing the bee sting therapy

390
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,920
it's prompting their adrenals

391
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,800
their self-treating themselves with with

392
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,360
steroids

393
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
they're using their own steroid to treat

394
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,639
their condition now what i don't like

395
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,000
about this

396
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,120
is that the adrenaline is corrosive

397
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,639
and it's it's agitating so we have

398
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,639
somebody with multiple sclerosis or

399
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,560
somebody with a neurological condition

400
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,560
that the doctors don't know why they're

401
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
sick medical research and science

402
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
doesn't know why people are sick they

403
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
don't have answers

404
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,480
if you want to know why people are sick

405
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,839
well these autoimmune conditions you

406
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
get cleansing heal so you can read the

407
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,880
true causes medical medium information

408
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
this only source that has that

409
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,920
information out there

410
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,480
other than that everywhere else is just

411
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,160
a game of like a cryptic game of

412
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,480
nonsense but anyway the bottom line is

413
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,880
that when your adrenals are flooding

414
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
because you're doing bee sting therapy

415
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,480
you're self-treating using your own

416
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,600
adrenaline

417
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,120
as a rush as a steroid

418
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
and then what it does is it gives you

419
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
relief it's the same thing with

420
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
like the same thing with some other

421
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
things that occur now

422
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,360
um it could be a temporary fix but

423
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,040
you'll notice with neurological

424
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
conditions it's only temporary

425
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,199
it only the relief only lasts for an

426
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,920
hour or half a day

427
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,480
or a quarter of a day or a day or two

428
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,079
days

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
depending on how much adrenaline was

430
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
released and so if you had a lot of

431
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
adrenaline released

432
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,800
i noticed that bee sting therapy when

433
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,959
you first get it

434
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,720
gives you some relief because a lot of

435
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,760
adrenaline gets released but on your

436
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,720
10th therapy

437
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,720
or your 50th bee sting you don't get the

438
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,880
response is the same and you need more

439
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,440
bee stings and you need more bee stings

440
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,279
i'm not a fan of it i don't recommend it

441
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,600
i don't recommend bee sting therapy

442
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,040
i never did and i'm not a fan of it um

443
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
but that's that's what i know about it

444
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,760
if it helps

445
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,199
anna gosh i started to drink a little a

446
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,199
little of coffee again

447
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,720
and my alopecia started to get worse but

448
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,360
i didn't see the link i

449
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,560
you know it's incredible that you you

450
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
understand this now

451
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,760
because of the medical medium

452
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,040
information about that but that's what

453
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,079
it does it's it's the

454
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,240
the industry actually is training

455
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,279
women to be addicted to the to the

456
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
caffeine

457
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,800
the caffeine kills women's adrenals and

458
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
nobody cares

459
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
nobody cares and then you get these like

460
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
fake doctors that

461
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,360
that have their podcast and they're just

462
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
like oh yeah matcha tea is great it's

463
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
got healing benefits and it's got

464
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,040
oh you know it's like you know your

465
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,560
dummy you know it's like

466
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,800
you don't get it you want to keep women

467
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
addicted too and then they just burn out

468
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
their adrenals and then when it's

469
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,440
pregnancy time

470
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
you don't have it here's the here's what

471
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,199
caffeine does

472
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:16,320
caffeine um makes pregnancies

473
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,279
harder and makes birth burn giving birth

474
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
harder

475
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,519
because you blow out your adrenals early

476
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
on in your life

477
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,279
and then then you get pregnant and then

478
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
you have a baby

479
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
and you in in the giving birth process

480
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
is much harder because your adrenals are

481
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,959
maxed out

482
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,000
and sometimes shot from coffee and all

483
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,279
that and this is medical medium

484
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,800
information nowhere else is this

485
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,160
information like all the information on

486
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
here if you're new here it's all medical

487
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,720
medium information

488
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
it's not somewhere else it's not

489
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
somewhere at so-and-so's it's not

490
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
wherever

491
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,839
and if it is they took little tidbits

492
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,440
and didn't incite it back to medical

493
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,240
medium information

494
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,560
um cindy after eight years of whole

495
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,519
foods and clean eating

496
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
i cannot lose weight i need help losing

497
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,480

30 pounds to get me back to pre-baby

499
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800

and i have autoimmune issues please

501
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,000
please please help the first thing is

502
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
autoimmune issues you can go to the

503
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
autoimmune section and cleanse the heal

504
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,199
and you can see back there

505
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
and you can see there's a protocol you

506
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
could take that protocol to your doctor

507
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
or practitioner if you want or just work

508
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,800
with it if you want to do

509
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
and you'll see there are different

510
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
supplements what to do take it slow one

511
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
little thing at a time but what you

512
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,079
learn is what was your autoimmune

513
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
disease name

514
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,000
that a doctor gave you too and you can

515
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
just go straight into autoimmune or you

516
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
can find that name specifically in the

517
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,279
book

518
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
but the point is is that what they don't

519
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,399
know

520
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,360
is what's behind autoimmune is a viral

521
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,040
condition and

522
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
i talk to doctors about this all the

523
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,440
time and you know and i teach doctors

524
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
this information if it's classified

525
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
under autoimmune

526
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,040
that's a viral issue and where do

527
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,199
viruses go and where are they

528
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,160
throughout a person's lifetime inside

529
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,839
their liver

530
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,320
and their liver gets stagnant and

531
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
sluggish and has this viral these viral

532
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
issues in there

533
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
and then when it gets stagnant and

534
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,320
sluggish and you can eat clean

535
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,399
you can eat whole foods your whole life

536
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
but it's not fixing the problem what i

537
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
would

538
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,760
what i would do is i would look in i

539
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
would go to the library get the book for

540
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,919

recover

556
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
and clean things up and if you got the

557
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,160
autoimmune issue learn

558
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,799
what the causes of that issue learn what

559
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,679

is suffering from chronic headaches and

587
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600

with burning stabbing pain for

590
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,440

healing um

592
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
so when it comes to chronic headaches

593
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,039
you can

594
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
you can look at the headache section

595
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
right here so if you look at cleanse the

596
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
heel

597
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
what i like about cleanse the heel it's

598
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,840
so comprehensive

599
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,520
there's so much information to customize

600
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,240
protocols take the book to the doctor

601
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,679
to your pediatrician or to to you know

602
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
whoever your caregiver is for your

603
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,760
daughter to and show the book

604
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,960
but headaches um and migraines that

605
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,799
little section it talks about

606
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,760
supplements and dosages that's one thing

607
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,440
you can do

608
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
the other thing is you got all the

609
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,120
different cleanses

610
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,080
what i would do okay if she was my

611
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,960
daughter i would

612
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,120
i would be focused on toxic heavy metals

613
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,520
maybe do the heavy metal detox smoothie

614
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,520
heavy metal detox cleanse in here i

615
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,039
would consider that as a possibility i

616
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
would look at the headache section in

617
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
the back

618
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
and you don't have to jump right in you

619
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
can just do

620
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,200
16 ounces of celery juice in the morning

621
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,799
on an empty stomach every morning that's

622
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,760
all you have to do just start with that

623
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,240
some lemon water

624
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,919
and you take it from there slow and and

625
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,919
you can just take one step at a time

626
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,480
how can i speed up the healing so i

627
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,799
don't get bloated

628
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,919
at all anymore so what happens with the

629
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,520
bloating

630
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,720
um jubilee is that um

631
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,880
there's a couple things you're doing

632
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,840
like what are you doing like what are

633
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,039
your foods

634
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,320
you're staying away from the dairy

635
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,919
products staying away from the eggs

636
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
right staying away from the gluten those

637
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,159
three are so important

638
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,600
because bloating for many people and i

639
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,520
talk about it in the books

640
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,960
is the streptococcus bacteria that sits

641
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,480
inside the intestinal tract

642
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,000
okay and that coupled with low hcl so

643
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
the gastric glands get burned out

644
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,039
another thing back to the caffeine thing

645
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,159
for one second

646
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,919
well that's another thing all the

647
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
caffeine beverages do when the chocolate

648
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,880
does the caffeine

649
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,799
it burns out the stomach glands so then

650
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
you get bloating later on in life that's

651
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
another thing too so not only do women

652
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,080
get their hair loose

653
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,720
lost later on they get their adrenals

654
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,960
get shot

655
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,280
so they have difficulty giving birth

656
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
they get bloating later on down the road

657
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
i mean the caffeine industry just does a

658
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,200
number on women

659
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,679
it's it's despicable really

660
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,200
but you want to get the hcl the stomach

661
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,320
glands build up you want to get your

662
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
liver bile function

663
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,320
better it sounds like it's hard but no i

664
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
mean you can literally just take cleanse

665
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
of heal look at the liver section there

666
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,600
work on getting that going on there

667
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,840
um and

668
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,559
so ann margaret um oh my i am a clinical

669
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,919
nutritionist

amazing and i cannot believe what i am

671
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,840
seeing

672
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,919
all these questions on things don't work

673
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
on all these questions on things don't

674
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
work so many of this not

675
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,240
evidence-based folks be careful oh

676
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,760
really really good question right there

677
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,280
um so you know

678
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,039
did you do you don't think any of the

679
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
folks here went to two three four five

680
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,559
doctors

681
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,919
um doctors not just clinical

682
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,840
nutritionists but actual

683
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,960
specialists and neurologists and medical

684
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,799
doctors

685
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
that's one thing ann i wanna i wanna ask

686
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,200
you so i wanna ask you a couple

687
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
questions because

688
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,880
a lot of people most people the medical

689
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
medium community they've actually been

690
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
through

691
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,440
20 doctors and three specialists

692
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,039
three neurologists psychiatrists because

693
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
they get told to go to there for for

694
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
things

695
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,280
because their neurological symptoms are

696
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,720
driving them crazy and

697
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,559
all of that and they've seen also

698
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,440
nutritionists and they tried different

699
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,400
things and

700
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,679
i think that insults people so it's not

701
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
going to insult me

702
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,360
i like you saying that because it gives

703
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
me a chance to just talk about the topic

704
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,400
in general

705
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,760
and but you're insulting people who

706
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,919
they're not stupid so and um people

707
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
go to doctors and they've been to a lot

708
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,240
of doctors

709
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
and they're still stuck with all their

710
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,840
different symptoms and conditions

711
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
so and they're suffering and they're

712
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,159
struggling so i would say ann

713
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,039
have some respect and they've seen their

714
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,880
nutritionists

715
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,880
and they've seen their health coaches so

716
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,360
i would just say

717
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,559
consider them and maybe not just think

718
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,000
about yourself

719
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,000
and think about me kind of what i do is

720
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,360
i'm thinking about them so i'm thinking

721
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,799
of the person who's suffering with the

722
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
worst trigeminal neuralgia where they

723
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,159
want to kill themselves

724
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,520
okay i'm thinking about the 20 year old

725
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,799
who can't go to college

726
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,799
and can't even look at the computer

727
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
screen because she can't

728
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,400
see properly because she has brain fog

729
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,039
and blurry eyes

730
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
i worry about and fatigue and she's and

731
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,640
her mom

732
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,720
has taken her already to 20 doctors

733
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,080
i'm worried about them and i'm worried

734
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,520
about the people who have

735
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,880
you know who can't get into a car

736
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,480
because their anxiety is so bad they

737
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,120
have a seizure before they get to their

738
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,039
car

739
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,559
and they can't even leave the house um i

740
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
worry about the people that are going

741
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,280
through all this

742
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,559
and the thousand and and here's in the

743
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,240
thousands and thousands of people that

744
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,159
are going through this

745
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,760
so and what i would do is instead of

746
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,880
being concerned about

747
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,159
your credentials and my no credentials

748
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
okay because i never said it was a

749
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,240
doctor be concerned about all the people

750
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,200
that can't find answers in their

751
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,039
suffering and then be open-minded to the

752
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
thousands of healing stories

753
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,080
that medical medium information is

754
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,679
brought and

755
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
and think about the street cred if you

756
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,840
look at the gold level label on this

757
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,960
book

758
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,919
okay you won't see that gold label on

759
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,799
um other books in health and and if you

760
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
look at the gold

761
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,159
label it says millions of copies sold in

762
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,240
the medical medium series

763
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,240
worldwide millions of copies and

764
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,279
millions of people with the street cred

765
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,960
and have reported that millions have

766
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,799
been healing and healed of medical

767
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,279
medium books so

768
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,640
i i'm just saying i hope you're doing

769
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,159
good with your doing and the work you're

770
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,720
doing in your practice

771
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,159
but just so you know i'm about to sick

772
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,039
and the suffering and people who

773
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
can't get answers

774
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,000
kelsey would like help understanding why

775
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,279
i get debilitating panic attacks

776
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,240
randomly triggered by fear or not

777
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,480
um being able to sleep once i start a

778
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,039
panic attack then it's nearly impossible

779
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
to stop

780
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,720
without taking conventional

781
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,440
pharmaceuticals i've been healing with

782
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
mm for two years and i got the panic

783
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,760
attack

784
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,080
and i got the panic attack shortly after

785
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,440
trying the advanced 369

786
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,400
for two days was off b12 for two months

787
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,279
recently

788
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,919
maybe that could be related so a couple

789
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,120
of things too

790
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,880
so um you get debilitating panic attacks

791
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
they're triggered and and been nearly

792
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,400
impossible to stop without taking

793
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,080
conventional pharmaceuticals so

794
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,640
the thing is with panic attacks is

795
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,880
that's with panic attacks and anxiety

796
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,880
you get all that is your trigeminal

797
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
nerve stuff so phrenic nerves trigeminal

798
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,120
nerve you got your you got your um

799
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
trigeminal nerve you got your phrenic

800
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,880
nerves you got your vagus nerve

801
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,880
so all those nerves work together so

802
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,559
they're all part of panic attacks vagus

803
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,279
nerve is the big one for panic attacks

804
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,360
right there

805
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,919
all on its own and so what happens is

806
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,760
that nerves get inflamed

807
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,000
and they get hypersensitive and when

808
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,240
they get hypersensitive

809
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,919
then you know you can be susceptible to

810
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,679
a panic attack at any point

811
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,440
any time and and fear can trigger one

812
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,600
at any moment i know when people have

813
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,720
severe anxiety and they got

814
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,919
they got um they're very sensitive they

815
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
can have a panic attack

816
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,559
really easily anything can trigger it it

817
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,960
could even be trying something new

818
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,720
i've seen people try something new for

819
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,919
the first time no matter what that is

820
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
i've seen people say well i'm going to

821
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,679
try coconut oil but i never tried it

822
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,120
before let me try it they have a panic

823
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,679
attack as they're trying it

824
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,880
or someone who's trying something new or

825
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,320
someone who's trying even a new

826
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,120
pharmaceutical they have a panic attack

827
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,240
while they're trying a new

828
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,120
pharmaceutical

829
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,120
and what happens is when the vagus nerve

830
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,320
gets so

831
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,919
hypersensitive and you end up getting

832
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,919
ptsd because of it

833
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,000
so you end up getting the whole ptsd

834
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,919
issue then we we run

835
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240
into trouble so then it's like a vicious

836
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
cycle we got the hypersensitive nerves

837
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,799
the vagus nerve and phrenic nerves and

838
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
then

839
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,640
we have the ptsd associated with it

840
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,640
because then we get

841
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,559
we it just it turns into a vicious cycle

842
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
it's so hard for people and i'm so sorry

843
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,919
you're suffering with that and all that

844
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,440
so if you go into the book if you go

845
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,799
into medical medium you can take the

846
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
book to your doctor you'll see that

847
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,559
there's an anxiety section there

848
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,840
and that's a great place to start and

849
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,200
um and another thing too is

850
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,880
is that with anxiety you can also have a

851
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
low-grade viral infection with toxic

852
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
heavy metals

853
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,000
creating that inflammation with the

854
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
vagus turbine phrenic nerve so with the

855
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
vagus nerve and phrenic nerves you can

856
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
have

857
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
the toxic heavy metals mercury's the big

858
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,440
one so

859
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,360
mercury is definitely the big one with

860
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
anxiety that's a huge

861
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,720
huge piece of a lot of people's

862
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,720
anxieties

863
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,320
and then anxiety conditions and then the

864
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,039
other things low-grade virus is like the

865
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,960
epstein-barr

866
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,080
what happens is epstein-barr tends to

867
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,080
feed off of mercury

868
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,080
tends to release a neurotoxin the

869
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,480
neurotoxin floats around

870
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,240
it saturates itself on a nerve once it

871
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,159
saturates itself on a nerve like

872
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,919
like a vagus nerve or phrenic nerves

873
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,279
they get hypersensitive

874
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,039
and then we have a panic attack so if i

875
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,240
had anxiety i'd be in the anxiety

876
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,880
section i

877
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,760
there's so many ways to go about it what

878
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,080
i would do

879
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,840
is i would do the model eating cleanse

880
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,440
that's what i would do something really

881
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,640
simple because um when it's simple and

882
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,399
basic like that

883
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
and you keep your fats low and you're

884
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,799
doing the mono eating cleanse

885
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,720
like the potato monowing cleanse of the

886
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,200
celery juice and then you have

887
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,799
then you have the steamed potatoes and

888
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,559
then you have the smoothie and so forth

889
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,640
and the lemon water and

890
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,159
and when you do you know when you do

891
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,520
that kind of thing

892
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,159
when you're doing like the moderating

893
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,159
cleanse it's so easy and gentle on

894
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,240
sensitive nerves and that's what i would

895
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
recommend for myself if i had anxiety or

896
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,760
a friend or a loved one had that

897
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
go to your doctor ask them what they

898
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,320
think about the book

899
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,880
and and i don't know what you have been

900
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,960
doing for the last couple years or so

901
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,559
you know and what's happening so i don't

902
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,240
know like what what you've been up to in

903
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,159
the last two three years what you're

904
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,679
eating what you're not eating

905
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,360
all of these things play a role if you

906
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,440
do nutritional yeast that's it

907
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,440
that could really really build up in

908
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
your system with all that msg

909
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,880
create a lot of anxiety because the

910
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,960
nerves can't handle msg

911
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
um you could also you know there's also

912
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,399
different bugs we we

913
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,679
share and we pick up and and you know we

914
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,240
we just end up

915
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,000
in contact with that along the way but

916
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
what i but i what i would recommend with

917
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
anxiety you see the anxiety section

918
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,279
take a look at the supplements you can

919
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,919
customize it for yourself you can talk

920
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,159
to your

921
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
doctor about it too and a little bit at

922
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,039
a time

923
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,720
maybe do a mono eating cleanse 369

924
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,480
cleanse is still amazing for that of

925
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,880
course a lot of people heal

926
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,000
that from another thing too you know

927
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,600
when you're doing

928
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,320
something new did you know

929
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,440
it's coming out of it what are you going

930
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760
back to

931
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,720
to eating something to where you used to

932
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,039
eat are you

933
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,559
what are you doing forging ahead and all

934
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,679
these things matter i talk about it in

935
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,440
detail here

936
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,399
but for anxiety though i talk about what

937
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,360
supplements

938
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,799
what is that are really critical you can

939
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,840
customize your protocol

940
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,279
for it i talk about the heavy metals um

941
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,039
another thing too you can just do the

942
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,960
heavy metal detox cleanse

943
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,640
so that's another thing i was talking to

944
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,640
a doctor a couple of weeks ago

945
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,559
this doctor's all about anxiety just

946
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,120
nothing about anxiety just nothing else

947
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,640
all about anxiety panic attacks and

948
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,720
different rides of anxiety and

949
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
they're really intrigued and invested in

950
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
the medical medium information and they

951
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,559
want to learn

952
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,640
and they were saying you know what

953
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,240
what's really helping with my patients

954
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
they were telling me is the heavy metal

955
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,399
detox cleanse because i told this doctor

956
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,159
toxic heavy metals like mercury

957
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,000
are responsible for so many anxiety

958
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,080
cases and

959
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,840
his doctor said it's doing wonders for

960
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,520
so many different cases of anxiety and

961
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,799
panic and everything else so maybe that

962
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,799
would be helpful too information

963
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,279
okay here's the question here please i

964
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
pray you could talk about numbness in

965
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,039
body from insect bites like spiders

966
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,399
absolutely terrified um if you

967
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,559
did you have it a spider bite did you

968
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,000
have one i mean i know the black widow

969
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,640
can cause

970
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,240
full body paralysis if it's not taken

971
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,519
care of if you don't get emergency

972
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,519
medical attention

973
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,360
or or medical attention you know black

974
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,080
widow spider can be really annoying

975
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,200
and and cause that you know when you do

976
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,720
get bit over time

977
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,080
the brown will wreck loose is really

978
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,519
annoying too these these fighters are

979
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,640
annoying i mean were you diagnosed with

980
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,440
a spider bite

981
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,039
was it an official spider bite or are

982
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,799
you just getting numbness in the body

983
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,080
and nobody knows but you thought you had

984
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,880
a bite like there's so many different

985
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,640
avenues and

986
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
i'm not trying to insult you at all or

987
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
throw you off that's not it you might

988
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,120
have got you might even seen this by

989
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,440
spider bite you

990
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,559
and then and then the doctor said yes

991
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,880
you had a

992
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,799
a brown recluse spider by yes you had a

993
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,720
black widow spider bite yes you had a

994
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,760
wolf spider bite

995
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,000
so that's one thing there but spider

996
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,720
bites yeah they can be really annoying

997
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,799
they haven't they have a neurotoxic

998
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,279
effect so you get numbness

999
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,000
that could last for years or just last

1000
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,080
for the moment

1001
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
you get numbness because of neurotoxins

1002
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,559
because spider bite venom

1003
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,519
is neurotoxic to some degree in a lot of

1004
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,120
cases so

1005
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,640
meaning like to some people they're not

1006
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,159
that sensitive some people are more

1007
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
sensitive i've seen people get spider

1008
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,000
bites it's like it didn't even happen i

1009
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,679
i got a friend who can have a black

1010
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,679
widow bite their hand and

1011
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,440
they're just aggravated for a week and

1012
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,480
then it's gone but but no but it's

1013
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,000
serious stuff

1014
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,519
and but numbness you know it's

1015
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,039
no matter what the trigger was say it

1016
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,399
was a spider bite then i would go into

1017
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080

1019
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,320
because you got sensitive nerves i would

1020
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,600
go into neurological symptoms take a

1021
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
look talk to your doctor

1022
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,640
you can take a look at the different

1023
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,279
supplements to help with it

1024
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,080
maybe focus on the foods i would i would

1025

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,799
so you know this i don't michelle what's

1060
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,360
weird is i don't know why

1061
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,080
it's just some of the people don't know

1062
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,399
this that are

1063
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,919
professionals like how do they not know

1064
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
that like is it because they've never

1065
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,200
been sick yet and they just don't

1066
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,640
understand what it's like to be sick so

1067
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,279
they just believe

1068
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,960
in this very land tale that the answers

1069
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,919
are out there i don't know how they can

1070
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,520
do that

1071
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,440
you know you know the difference you

1072
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,440
know what it's like to be sick

1073
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,639
stay sick after 20 doctors and 20

1074
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,440
nutritionists

1075
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,399
and then not have answers until you find

1076
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,560
answers

1077
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,760
but you know what that's like it's the

1078
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,079
bubble people are in

1079
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,919
it's confusing me it still does um

1080
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,119
actually what helps with acid reflux um

1081
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,079
you know first of all i mean you can go

1082
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,800
really simple

1083
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,760
actually you can go so so gentle and

1084
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,679
simple you can

1085
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,159
you can go with eight ounces of celery

1086
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,000
juice just eight ounces of celery juice

1087
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,200
you can do aloe vera and i talk about

1088
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
that in here you can do a little bit

1089
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,240
maybe aloe

1090
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,520
water you can just do the aloe water

1091
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,919
where you blend a little bit of the

1092
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,159
inside gel to a fresh aloe leaf

1093
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,680
and i talk about that in here and you

1094
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,720
could do just a little aloe water each

1095
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,440
day and see what

1096
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,040
moves it because what happens is we get

1097
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,640
a little bacteria in our gut

1098
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,720
we get a little bit of that the old

1099
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,720
strep in our system everybody has it

1100
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,640
nobody doesn't have strep we all have it

1101
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,040
and a little bit of strep in my system

1102
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
and then you know and then the liver

1103
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
gets a little stagnant and sluggish even

1104
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,680
in younger people

1105
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,119
um stomach glands get get tired even in

1106
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
younger people all these different

1107
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,480
things

1108
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,160
but it's really simple as like okay let

1109
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,280
me just start out with maybe a little

1110
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
bit of celery juice

1111
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,440
eight ounces maybe start out with 16

1112
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,079
ounces which would be ideal

1113
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,760
every single morning 16 ounces of celery

1114
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,480
juice on an empty stomach

1115
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,000
and take it from there one day at a time

1116
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,040
and talk to your practitioner tell them

1117
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,520
what you're doing

1118
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,079
but that's something just to start with

god bless you i'm so happy i'm proud of

1135
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,400
you 17 years of going through hell and

1136
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,160
back i call it

1137
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,599
hell and back and i caught and now

1138
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,599
you're rising out of the ashes

1139
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,079
that's what that is exactly and what's

1140
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,520
strange youtube is that

1141
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,200
isn't that strange that but yet a couple

1142
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,480
of nutritionists or some dietitian or

1143
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,640
some other doc doesn't know

1144
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,839
like that exists they don't know that

1145
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,359
and that tells me they're just not

1146
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
experienced or something and they live

1147
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,880
in a bubble

1148
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,280
but exactly you've been through hell and

1149
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,640
back well that's the world i live in

1150
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,400
i live in the world of 35 years and even

1151
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
going back before that with my gift

1152
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,079
of receiving information spirit of

1153
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,040
compassion hearing his voice as of age

1154
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,960
four

1155
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,079
and knowing people suffer that when i

1156
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,800
was age six seven

1157
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,200
eight years old told people suffer every

1158
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,119
day

1159
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,480
from spirit of compassion told how many

1160
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,640
people are suffering

1161
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,920
and how they can't find answers and how

1162
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,520
they're on mattress island

1163
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,599
and some are losing their lives and

1164
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,720
nobody cares and how science research

1165
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,400
doesn't have answers

1166
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,160
i've been taught that by spirit of

1167
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,040
compassion since i was a child

1168
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,800
okay and so it's amazing someone just of

1169
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,040
course wants to discriminate against me

1170
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,040
and step on right on my face and walk on

1171
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,560
over all the people chronic and spit on

1172
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,640
all the people with chronic illness

1173

realize how hard it is for me

1188
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,079
i have to hear spirit of compassion as

1189
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,000
i'm sitting here talking to you guys so

1190
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,520
i'm hearing a voice here perfectly clear

1191
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,280
like someone's yelling in my ear or

1192
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,200
talking my ear loud i

1193
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,040
you know it's like having an earpod in

1194
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,400
of of of

1195
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,400
of a podcast or an earpod of music or

1196
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,079
something somebody talking and so i have

1197
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,040
to do that and read comments

1198
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
and deliver my information all combined

1199
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,960

1210
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,520

um so natasha

1216
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,079
help me prevent migraine during my

1217
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,079
period what can i do

1218
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,680
natasha i'd love to talk about that for

1219
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
a second because what happens is the

1220
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,960
reason why the migraines come

1221
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,160
during menstruation is because are

1222
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,280
not our because i'm a man but women's

1223
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,560
immune systems drop all women this isn't

1224
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,640
you but all women's immune systems drop

1225
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,560
eighty percent of their immune system

1226
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,920
goes to the reproductive system so when

1227
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,560
you have your period

1228
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,200
eighty percent of your immune system

1229
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,359
goes to your reproductive system

1230
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,880
to protect it that's that's and that's

1231
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,920
medical medium information it's it's not

1232
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
out there you can't google it or

1233
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,520
whatever nobody knows that

1234
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,040
20 of your immune system is left

1235
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,320
covering the rest of the body

1236
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,800
taking care of everything else in the

1237
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,640
body so that means if your

1238
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,839
uh migraines okay or are because of a

1239
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,359
little bit of strep that's in your

1240
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,200
system all these years a little bit of

1241
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,680
strep inside the sinuses

1242
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,280
um a little bit of epstein bar inside

1243
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,200
the liver or however or

1244
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,960
nerves are sensitive or a little bit of

1245
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
toxic heavy metals all of it that i talk

1246
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,119
about through migraines and things like

1247
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,119
that

1248
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,319
and sensitive nerves like vagus nerve

1249
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,680
frantic nerves

1250
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,800
trigeminal nerves and you get the

1251
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,319
headache you get them like the

1252
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,800
neurological migraines

1253
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,680
so when it happens that happens during

1254
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,280
menstruation

1255
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
and because and it could happen during

1256
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,280
ovulation a little bit too so it can

1257
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,119
happen there too because 40

1258
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,720
of a woman's immune system goes directly

1259
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
to the reproductive system during

1260
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,119
ovulation leaving

1261
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,599
only 60 percent everywhere else so it's

1262
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,839
it's

1263
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,359
because of that you're not when women go

1264
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,359
into their cycles and ovulation they're

1265
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,040
not running on 100 immune system

1266
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,880
and then anything they have that's what

1267
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,640
happens with women that's why acne

1268
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
breaks out that's streptococcus during

1269
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,400
cycles

1270
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,319
or shortly after cycles or so that's why

1271
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,000
when women have fatigue they get more

1272
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,599
fatigue during their cycles because

1273
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,280
they're dealing with something else

1274
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,359
and their immune system is going all the

1275
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,599
way to the reproductive system instead

1276
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,119
of watching everything else it's it's

1277
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,480
the difference between men and women

1278
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,160
it's one of the

1279
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,319
one of these differences between men and

1280
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,160
women men's immune systems just

1281
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,520
unless they burn themselves out their

1282
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,319
immune system stays

1283
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,760
just level it stays level it's it's so

1284
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,839
unfair to women women

1285
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,280
their immune system has to has to

1286
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,800
actually juggle

1287
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
and and take care of the reproductive

1288
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,720
system which is how life is going to

1289
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,880
move forward here in planet earth

1290
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:36,079
um um yeah so and

1291
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,440
um so what i would do is like when you

1292
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
look at the book take the book to your

1293
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,839
doctor

1294
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,520
with the migraines too you can take the

1295
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,200
book to your doctor you can look at the

1296
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,880
protocol for supplements in the back of

1297
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,160
the doctor for headaches and migraines

1298
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,280
you can look in the back

1299
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,640

1319
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,839
proud of you

1320
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,920
it's like you know what it is you like

1321
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,520
you you and you probably went to a lot

1322
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,319
of doctors for that acid reflux you

1323
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,240
probably went

1324
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,000
went through a lot and sometimes it

1325
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,440
takes time to heal some people

1326
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
shelly some people want to be healed in

1327
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,760
one week you know they want to be healed

1328
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,680
in one week

1329
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,319
but then they don't do enough of the

1330
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,839
protocols or customize it right like you

1331
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,560
did and

1332
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,560
it's amazing

1333
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:58,880
so i'm looking through more questions

1334
00:42:48,480 --> 00:43:02,319
you guys

1335
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,839
so staccata oh my goodness thank you for

1336
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,880
the period answer

1337
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,520
so for exa right suffered for

1338
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,800
a very long time with different things

1339
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,319
but that's what happens when you have

1340
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
your periods and then all these

1341
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,599
different problems happen and when your

1342
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,520
periods are coming

1343
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,800
everything feels worse because you have

1344
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,319
these other conditions

1345
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,079
and then the immune system can't be

1346
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,079
taken care of all that so it

1347
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,680
it goes to your cycle only and when it

1348
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,200
goes to your cycle only oh my god

1349
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,000
everything that you deal with

1350
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,960
rises up that's what i you know and i

1351
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,359
like trying to

1352
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,960
get people and women to work on their

1353
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,400
conditions get down to the bottom of

1354
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,599
their conditions so when their periods

1355
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,160
come they're not

1356
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,440
they're not mortified or scared or ptsd

1357
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,920
out that their period is going to come

1358
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,560
and cause

1359
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,560
more trouble

1360
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,520
folklore family you and spirit helped me

1361
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,359
recover from lung cancer

1362
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,960
bless your heart i'm proud of you you

1363
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,400
worked hard for it

1364
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,319
nothing um hi anthony my mom's nails are

1365
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,079
going brown and coming off do you know

1366
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,520
what this could be

1367
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,119
so um good question nothing

1368
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,040
what happens with fingernails they're a

1369
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,680
big indication of the liver

1370
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,240
so big indication of the liver so what

1371
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,640
would

1372
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,800
you know what would mom like to do would

1373
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,400
she do a little bit of celery juice

1374
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,240
you know it's funny with her with her

1375
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,200
mom's you know it's like

1376
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,720
it's like you know it's some moms out

1377
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,000
there they'll do everything and some

1378
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,520
will just be like well i'll do a little

1379
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,359
bit of celery juice now and i don't

1380
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,440
really want to do this but i'll try that

1381
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,880
i would consider a little bit of celery

1382
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,280
juice because instantly that's going to

1383
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,119
start going to the liver a little bit

1384
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,560
and i would consider you know some b12

1385
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,640
you know that's you know one thing i

1386
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,280
would consider but when it comes down to

1387
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,640
nails

1388
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,079
um and and she can go to the doctor she

1389
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,160
can take the information

1390
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,160
too so nothing she can go to the doctor

1391
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,760
she can take the information

1392
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,040
and see what the doctor wants to do or

1393
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,640
anything and you can look in the back of

1394
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,280
the different stuff back there

1395
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,400
but but foods are a great way to start

1396
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,880
and you can talk to the doc

1397
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,599
talk to your mom's doctor and find out

1398
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,280
what

1399
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,960
which you know find out what your doctor

1400
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,599
feels like for different things

1401
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,200
i know that's spinach and i talked to

1402
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,160
another doctor recently about nails and

1403
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,720
stuff

1404
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,319
i recommended spinach and spinach soups

1405
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,000
so you take raw spinach

1406
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,520
you put in a blender you make a spinach

1407
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
soup i talk about the recipes and all

1408
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,680
the medical medium books

1409
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,440
and the spinach soup really does help

1410
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,760
with that with the liver and the nails

1411
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,119
and

1412
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,119
coupled with a little bit of celery

1413
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,520
juice and you know

1414
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,200
aloe water lemon water these are just

1415
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,240
little basics and she can talk to her

1416
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,560
doctor about what she

1417
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,560
likes or not to do what the doctor likes

1418
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,880
carolyn says i bought all the books yay

1419
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,920
you're awesome thank you thank you you

1420
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,119
know because i know that if you're

1421
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,480
buying all the books then you're going

1422
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,160
to tell somebody else

1423
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,680

1424
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,960

you can help a family member you can

1426
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,480
help a friend

1427
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,680
and then it's all that matters it's like

1428
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,880
the people that are in your life and

1429
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,160

1435
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,400
brain fog i remember being like her in

1436
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,520
my 30s if i only knew this stuff

1437
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,520
and anna i know it's it's

1438
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,720
that's what happens it's like years go

1439
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,720
by and decades go by

1440
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,319
no one everybody forgets what happens

1441
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,599
you don't forget you know what you've

1442
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,440
been through in your life but

1443
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,440
i noticed that the younger people that

1444
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,640
aren't so sick and they don't know what

1445
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,240
everybody went through

1446
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,079
and they're just kind of experimenting

1447
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,800
for fun on all these fun things and

1448
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,839
doing their health channels i get it and

1449
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,880
but honestly i mean ever the history

1450
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,760
gets forgotten

1451
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,359
like history like just who cares if

1452
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,880
millions of people suffered from lyme

1453
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,520
disease many of them lost their lives

1454
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,160
because of bad

1455
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,960
treatments who cares if people suffered

1456
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,359
the worst

1457
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,079
endometriosis and and periods like all

someone will say well he likes celery

1467
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,560
juice for everything that's

1468
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,599
it's one of the medical medium tools and

1469
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,720
millions of people

1470
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,800
hundreds of millions of people are

1471
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,319
drinking celery juice now and there's a

1472
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,800
reason because it really does

1473
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,599
it is one of those incredible medical

1474
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,440
medium tools

that spirit of compassion brought here

1476
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,400

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,480
condition

1483
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,160
is i would be on low fats really low fat

1484
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,599
so if you're an animal protein person

1485
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,520
and you like animal protein

1486
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,839
maybe once a day only do animal protein

1487
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,359
once a day and i would

1488
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,520
i would do it at the end of the day i

1489
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:55,440
would never do eggs i would stay away

1490
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,400
from eggs i would stay away from

1491
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,200
dairy products completely butter milk

1492
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,839
cheese

1493
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,200
kefir yogurt i would get rid of if i had

1494
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,200
that condition

1495
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,040
and so and i would stay off of the

1496
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,640
caffeine if i had the condition if you

1497
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,839
possibly can so these are some of the

1498
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,520
things i would do i would stay off of

1499
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,480
fermented foods if i had that condition

1500
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,440
so i'm just giving you

1501
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,079
what to stay away from what to bring in

1502
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,040
um

1503
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,000

the spinach soups are great can you do

1508
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,480
that can you do the lemon water in the

1509

time i eat

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,160
so you must been dealing with uploading

1567
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,160
problem for years and years and years

1568
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,680
and what i would do to begin with is i

1569
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,599
would look and cleanse the heel

1570
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,040

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,800
specifically i mean but bloating go in

1578
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,599
the bloating section

1579
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
and take a look and you can start there

1580
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,040
but what i like to do for

1581
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,200
it's not about fruits and vegetables

1582
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,559
like raw fruits and vegetables

1583
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,000
is not an answer and i think there's a

1584
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,839
confusion out there

1585
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,040
people will say like american means raw

1586
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,000
fruits vegetables are fruits and

1587
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,599
vegetables it's like

1588
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,680
no medical medium is a thousand

1589
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,599
different protocols and

1590
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,920
customizing for the specific condition

1591
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,240
of what's going wrong so you're bloating

1592
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,119
what's going on with that bloating well

1593
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,960
find out what

1594
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,480
causes bloating so you read that in the

1595
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,240
back here and you find out what causes

1596
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,800
bloating to begin with okay

1597
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,240
and then um you learn that it's low

1598
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,800
hydrochloric acid

1599
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,319
so low hydrochloric acid from years ago

1600
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,800
from your whole life

1601
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,960
so your stomach glands just have not

1602
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,800
returned to the where they need to be

1603
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,640
yet they haven't got to that place of

1604
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,800
where they need to be the other can

1605
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,480
the other thing that happens is low bile

1606
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,640
reserves in your liver

1607
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,319
so you can be on only raw fruits and

1608
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,480
vegetables and leafy greens

1609
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,559
but are you doing fats are you burdening

1610
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,440
your liver how much avocado are you

1611
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,240
doing so

1612
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,920
really bad bloating cases and i teach

1613
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,920
doctors this all the time

1614
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,599
you want to get the liver back so you

1615
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,200
want to get the bile reserves back and

1616
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,000
one way of doing that is you drop the

1617
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,800
fats

1618
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,640
you drop the fats get those fats down

1619
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,240
and when you do that you drop you get

1620
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,359
rid of the nuts and seeds for a while

1621
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,480
you get rid of the

1622
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,160
avocado you get rid of the oils and if

1623
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,720
you're doing animal proteins get rid of

1624
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,559
the animal

1625
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,040
proteins for a while get rid of all the

1626
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,480
fats whether plant-based or animal-based

1627
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,160
whether you're a plant-based or animal

1628
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,839
baser and

1629
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,000
and what happens is you have all these

1630
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,920
old rotting proteins on lining the

1631
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,520
intestinal tract all these old rancid

1632
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,640
fats that have been there for years 10

1633
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,160
20 30 years

1634
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,319
they're on the inside you know the

1635
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,119
intestinal tract lining they need to

1636
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,880
finally get

1637
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,160
cleaned out and they will over time so

1638
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,839
it takes a little time

1639
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,359
then you build up your hydrochloric acid

1640
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,920
in your stomach land you build up your

1641
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,920
liver

1642
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,480
all these things matter you clean out

1643
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,720
bacteria that's hiding in the gut

1644
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,240
streptococcus hiding in all that and

1645
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,880
then you do you look at the book and you

1646
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
look hey

1647
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,160
you know what's going on the cause of

1648
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,119
bloating and then you look mono eating

1649
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
cleanse

1650
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,800
celery juice is something you bring in

1651
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,960
32 ounces once a day

1652
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,000
so fruits and vegetables is not enough

1653
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,240
that's all great

1654
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,839
and and raw fruits and vegetables is not

1655
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,200
enough that's the difference between if

1656
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,319
you find somebody on youtube and they're

1657
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,160
just a raw

1658
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,839
raw foodie or something and they're

1659
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,400
doing raw fruits vegetables and that's

1660
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,079
their thing

1661
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,000
that don't mean anything when you're

1662
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,960
sick what means when you're sick

1663
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,920
is what's wrong what's the answer to

1664
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,160
whatever you're doing

1665
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,119
and then how to use your fruits and

1666
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,319
vegetables

1667
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,520
how to use them as tools you know is the

1668
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:29,760
is the bloating severe bloating and and

1669
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,200
mono eating is something i look at when

1670
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,960
it's severe bloating so like

1671
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,440
gastroparesis severe bloating all these

1672
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,960
different

1673
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,480
conditions mono eating is really

1674
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,400
important so

1675
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,520
i hope that that helps in celery juice

1676
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,359
like 32 ounces

1677
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,640
every single morning you can do fruits

1678
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,240
and vegetables but if you're not doing

1679
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,680
32 ounces every single morning and

1680
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,400
you're aloe water

1681
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,000
and and doing and knowing what's wrong

1682
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,640
so you can do that say the monolithing

1683
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,319
cleanse

1684
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,760
see how all these things matter all the

1685
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,559
different ways you can heal and the

1686
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
different

1687
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,319
tools you can use and somebody could be

1688
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,920
like raw fruits and vegetables it

1689
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,680
doesn't mean anything

1690
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,119
but but i'm proud of you though that

1691
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,800
you're eating that clean

1692
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,400
it's just what i mean but it doesn't

1693
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
mean anything it means you have to know

1694
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,040
what's wrong

1695
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,960
then be able to customize it using

1696
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,440
healing tools the only place i've seen

1697
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,119

reactions

1726
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,880
whoa it's a question right there detox

1727
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,359
reactions i've been drinking celery

1728
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,200
juice

1729
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,799
for four weeks and it just had a nasty

1730
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,920
bat of shingles pop up

1731
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:17,280
can this happen not from celery juice um

1732
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,880
like there's people with shingles and

1733
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,000
they use celery just to get rid of

1734
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,720
shingles that's there's people

1735
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,400
out there that they they have conditions

1736
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,640
caused by the shingles

1737
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,400
so um if you weren't doing your celery

1738
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,119
juice the shingles were still coming

1739
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,720
um that's this is how it works it's just

1740
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,839
if you were doing

1741
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,640
if you were doing oil pulling for a

1742
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,079
month

1743
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,920
and you had your shingles it would be

1744
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,720
the oil pulling that caused it it's just

1745
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,880
a normal

1746
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,480
assist life it's like it's like that's

1747
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,839
how we think when we're trying something

1748
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,280
new or anything and it happens to be

1749
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,440
around a time when something's already

1750
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,960
out in order for shingles to come out

1751
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,440
it had been in the works for the last

1752
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,920
six months to a year so shingles doesn't

1753
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,880
just

1754
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,520
come out it's in the process of coming

1755
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,000
out so

1756
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,280
it's in the process it's usually you get

1757
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,680
it a year before

1758
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,040
you get it six months before and then

1759
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,720
it's in you

1760
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,400
and it stays in you until it

1761
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,680
proliferates and proliferates and then

1762
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,880
you have the rash

1763
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,720
so so um four weeks

1764
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,640
and the shingles coming out well it's

1765
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,760
more like four months and the shingles

1766
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,119
comes out

1767
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,119
so stacey what i would do is look into

1768
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,520
the shingle section here and jump on

1769
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,680
this

1770
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,040
because get the book out for free at the

1771
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,599
library

1772
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,359
jump on it in a sense where you want to

1773
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,880
take the protocols to your doctor

1774
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,480
that's in the shingles protocol so you

1775
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,319
can protect yourself from

1776
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,480
post shingles post shingles is the

1777
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:39,520
problem celery juice is helpful

1778
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,599
uh i i just i wouldn't i mean i wouldn't

1779
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,440
stop the seller issues

1780
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,880
but there's so many things you can do

1781
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,680
for your immune system and what else are

1782
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,599
you eating

1783
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,960
were you eating something else you're

1784
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,480
drinking celery just but were you eating

1785
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,599
something else that feeds shingles

1786
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,240
because aids

1787
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,440
because eggs feed shingles so it you

1788
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,599
know that's what happens with eggs

1789
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,200
they feed shingles and what they also do

1790
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,359
they feed all the different bugs

1791
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,480
so that's what they do so when it comes

1792
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,880
down dairy products

1793
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,359
feeds shingles you know eggs feed

1794
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,359
shingles

1795
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,040
so breezy hi i am wondering what to do

1796
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,280

1799
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,359
so all the years i mean 35 years of

1800
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,599
helping so many people

1801
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,920
and helping so many people to doctors

1802
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,680
doctors patients and so forth because i

1803
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,640

1804
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,680
symptoms guy

1805
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,720
that's what it was so um back going back

1806
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,480
35 years

1807
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,640
he's the bizarre symptom guys if you

1808
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,520
have a guy and what happens is doctors

1809
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,119
would be like

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,280
okay i know this guy um

1811
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,720

and let's see what spirit of compassion

1817
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,839
has to say and so spirit of compassion

1818
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,680
would give information to the doctor and

1819
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,400
what happens is with twitches and spasms

1820
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,920
and all that

1821
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,920

most part outside of some different

1823
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,599
viral issues and other things

1824
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,640
would be the toxic heavy metals so

1825
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,680
mercury

1826
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,319

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,920
well it's it's like this it's if that

1848
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,200
means

1849
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,640
here's how it works if you it

1850
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,960
okay if you stop your plant-based fats

1851
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,160
that'd be nuts seeds avocado and all

1852
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,640
that your most

1853
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,559
those are high-calorie foods you're most

1854
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,960
likely stopping those and not getting

1855
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,359
enough calories on the opposite end

1856
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,280
so here's how it goes so you're eating

1857
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,720
your plant-based diet

1858
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,960
you stop the highest calorie part of

1859
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,960
your diet which is the fats

1860
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,240
so you stop eating two avocados a day

1861
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,480
you stop eating uh

1862
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,760
you know handfuls of cashews you stop

1863
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,640
eating oils

1864
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,000
you stop those high calories okay once

1865
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,839
those are gone

1866
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
you're under calorie now without

1867
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,480
realizing so you don't know how to like

1868
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,680
all of a sudden bring in enough potatoes

1869
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,319
enough sweet potatoes winter squash

1870
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,280
enough bananas enough you know a few

1871
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,680
dates or

1872
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,799
you know and you have to also get in the

1873
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,000
mineral salts

1874
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:07,200
critical so you can't just go off

1875
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,480
of all these fats and then not get some

1876
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,240
mineral salts in

1877
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,240
you'll go under calories you won't get

1878
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,920
enough mineral salts plus you'll have

1879
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,319
fats in your system so here's how it

1880
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,079
works

1881
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,799
you've been eating your fats all your

1882
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,359
life the minute you stop your fats

1883
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,319
you know the fats don't go away they're

1884
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,680
in the liver

1885
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:25,839
they're in they're in the bloodstream

1886
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,520
for three straight days after that

1887
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,200
then they're in the bloodstream for

1888
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,760
quite a while because you start

1889
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,040
you start getting rid of toxic fat

1890
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,880
storages

1891
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,480
so then you get all of sudden you got

1892
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,280
still more fat going into the

1893
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,280
bloodstream

1894
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,280
so what it is is what i'm suggesting

1895
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,000
which is probably what's happening is

1896
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,319
you're going off your high calorie fats

1897
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,640
and

1898
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,079
you're under calorie for the moment and

1899
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,280
you're getting a swing because you're

1900
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,640
under calories so then you're getting a

1901
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,000
little bit of a blood sugar drop

1902
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,839
so you want to consider you want to make

1903
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,200
sure you're doing enough of the

1904
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,119
you know enough things like you're doing

1905
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,880
the celery juice for the mineral salts

1906
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,079
you're getting enough in your smoothie

1907
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,200
you're getting the wild blueberries

1908
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,760
you're getting the bananas in your

1909
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,599
smoothie

1910
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,760
you're doing the steamed potatoes and

1911
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,960
leafy greens and you're not

1912
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,119
like giving up calories

1913
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,960
and that's what happens to try that

1914
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,119
that's one angle right there it could be

1915
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,520
really helpful i love that food question

1916
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,240
um you know papaya banana more of that

1917
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,240
in there

1918
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,440
more the celery juice more of the

1919
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,520
lettuce is and you

1920
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,680
keep that balance while you're getting

1921
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,799
rid of that old fat storage and the fat

1922
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,559
that's been in your bloodstream

1923
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,240
for three days because it's still going

1924
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,440
to be in your bloodstream for days after

1925
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,880
you go off the fats so you're going to

1926
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,280
