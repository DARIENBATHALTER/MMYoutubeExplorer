[3.84 - 9.64] spiritual tools because it is ready for
[7.64 - 11.84] pre-order okay so check it out you could
[9.64 - 15.64] go to Amazon you could see it there you
[11.84 - 18.28] could go to Apple see it there and I
[15.64 - 20.52] just want to say this is that when you
[18.28 - 23.56] do hear what you're about to hear when
[20.52 - 25.92] you actually get a hold of the Angels
[23.56 - 29.40] demons and spiritual tools just know
[25.92 - 33.20] it's 7 and 1/2 hours 7 and 1/2 hours of
[29.40 - 35.60] information from above s so lots of
[33.20 - 37.64] questions I asked lots of questions that
[35.60 - 40.72] I thought about other people have asked
[37.64 - 43.20] me and what happens is it turns into the
[40.72 - 44.60] situation where you're saying okay but
[43.20 - 46.88] wait a minute how does it work with
[44.60 - 50.08] demons what happens with demons are
[46.88 - 51.84] demons even real what is a demon what
[50.08 - 54.40] does a demon
[51.84 - 58.68] do what happens to somebody's Soul when
[54.40 - 60.44] they pass where does it go what happens
[58.68 - 62.80] with that and the question is just roll
[60.44 - 64.40] into one question after another after
[62.80 - 65.80] another you if you don't know what I'm
[64.40 - 68.12] talking about I'm talking about angels
[65.80 - 71.00] demons and spiritual tools check it out
[68.12 - 73.48] on Amazon just type in medical medium
[71.00 - 76.96] Angels demons and spiritual Tools in
[73.48 - 79.56] Amazon Apple it's there too uh I think
[76.96 - 82.40] it's on Spotify I think it's there too
[79.56 - 86.24] but so what would happen is I'm like
[82.40 - 88.52] okay Spirit okay what is a demon like
[86.24 - 90.32] for real though people say this and
[88.52 - 93.80] people say that and people do this and
[90.32 - 95.96] people what is what's really what is
[93.80 - 98.08] what is a
[95.96 - 101.52] demon and
[98.08 - 103.68] so it's information that I think you got
[101.52 - 106.56] to be ready for you have to be ready for
[103.68 - 109.72] the information I'm going to be honest
[106.56 - 112.36] and you might want to like keyate it a
[109.72 - 116.56] little bit you might want to decant it a
[112.36 - 118.68] little bit you might want to increment
[116.56 - 120.96] it a little bit if that's even a word if
[118.68 - 123.76] any of those are words you might want to
[120.96 - 125.32] just kind of ease into it the seven and
[123.76 - 127.64] a half hours you might start with a half
[125.32 - 131.56] an hour you listen to that half an
[127.64 - 133.28] hour and then you go okay okay okay all
[131.56 - 136.24] right all right and then you back away
[133.28 - 139.72] from it because there's so much to
[136.24 - 143.36] digest because I actually have a
[139.72 - 145.88] source that understands what Angels what
[143.36 - 151.32] demons are what kind of spiritual tools
[145.88 - 155.48] to use and information about yes hell
[151.32 - 158.44] yes hell and other information too so
[155.48 - 161.68] when it's real information from above
[158.44 - 165.92] the game Changes Everything Changes it's
[161.68 - 168.24] not like oh theories and theorizing and
[165.92 - 170.72] theologists you know going into some
[168.24 - 172.72] scripture and you know looking into here
[170.72 - 175.04] and looking into here but this says this
[172.72 - 177.32] and this is that and then summary you
[175.04 - 181.80] know summarizing what they think it
[177.32 - 183.88] could be when you hear it from s so and
[181.80 - 186.20] you hear about demons and you hear about
[183.88 - 188.60] angels and you hear about things like
[186.20 - 191.96] hell and you hear about and then you
[188.60 - 194.40] hear what it really is and what's
[191.96 - 198.04] happening it's something that's a whole
[194.40 - 199.88] another level of understanding it's a
[198.04 - 202.20] whole another level of all kinds of
[199.88 - 204.28] stuff so I'm just saying this because

[349.28 - 355.60] freak accidents freak accidents you know
[353.24 - 358.04] when you ask Spirit of compassion like
[355.60 - 361.92] so all right so I'm afraid to
[358.04 - 364.00] ask right I'm afraid to ask Spirit but
[361.92 - 365.20] can you fill me in a little bit about
[364.00 - 367.80] freak
[365.20 - 371.84] accidents how does that work like how is
[367.80 - 375.16] it possible the craziest crap happens
[371.84 - 379.52] how's it possible a girl can be sitting
[375.16 - 381.56] on uh a rocky area in Thailand or
[379.52 - 383.24] something and you've got the water
[381.56 - 385.60] coming in the waves are coming in and
[383.24 - 387.88] the friends are all there and how you
[385.60 - 389.80] know how is it possible where all of a
[387.88 - 394.00] sudden just a wave comes and the
[389.80 - 397.04] person's gone or how's it
[394.00 - 399.24] possible with the freak accident thing
[397.04 - 400.88] like what is it is it really coincidence
[399.24 - 403.48] and I'm just asking Spirit I'm like
[400.88 - 406.36] Spirit like come on you know is it
[403.48 - 408.48] really coincidence what's a freak
[406.36 - 410.68] accident and it takes it all the way
[408.48 - 413.64] down to freak to begin with the whole
[410.68 - 415.40] freak word information about this from
[413.64 - 418.60] Spirit of compassion and when you hear
[415.40 - 420.64] that you're just like what like oh my
[418.60 - 423.40] God I'm going to release this I'm going
[420.64 - 425.92] to release this
[423.40 - 428.16] information yeah I'm going to release
[425.92 - 428.16] this
[430.84 - 436.76] information and it just gives you
[433.56 - 439.56] tingles up your spine tingles up your
[436.76 - 441.44] spine anyway Angels demons and spiritual
[439.56 - 443.04] tools check it out I mean I look I'll
[441.44 - 447.24] talk about it more as we go along but
[443.04 - 450.60] that's that's I'm actually like nervous
[447.24 - 454.64] nervous I mean look I I've done a
[450.60 - 456.08] trillion lives trillion lives right I
[454.64 - 458.24] haven't done a trillion lives but I've
[456.08 - 461.04] been live a lot of times over the years
[458.24 - 464.24] right and I've done different things but
[461.04 - 466.24] I'm nervous just talking about the
[464.24 - 467.52] angels and demons and spiritual tools
[466.24 - 470.72] just talking about angel Steven
[467.52 - 473.92] spiritual tools because it's so intense
[470.72 - 476.92] and it's so jam-packed but it's not just
[473.92 - 478.52] jam-packed it's not like it's different
[476.92 - 480.92] than the medical medium books the other
[478.52 - 483.12] medical medium books it's different than
[480.92 - 485.28] cleanse to heel it's different than
[483.12 - 487.92] brain saver it's different than you know
[485.28 - 489.68] medical medium books because it's the
[487.92 - 491.12] spiritual end of things and there's
[489.68 - 493.24] spiritual information in these medical
[491.12 - 495.12] medium books the spirit of compassion
[493.24 - 496.88] has given a lot of spiritual about the
[495.12 - 499.64] soul about lots of things in the medical
[496.88 - 503.32] medium books but
[499.64 - 505.68] then if you like is the Grim Reaper real
[503.32 - 507.60] what is the Grim Reaper how does it work
[505.68 - 509.96] if there was a grim reaper and then you
[507.60 - 512.68] hear this information I'm here it from
[509.96 - 517.48] Spirit of compassion and I'm like okay
[512.68 - 520.40] all right I will put that in here I will
[517.48 - 523.68] put that in here what is a grim reaper
[520.40 - 525.88] is there a grim reaper what is it really
[523.68 - 529.32] what happens with Souls when they cross
[525.88 - 531.36] over what ha is the are demons real like
[529.32 - 534.20] all this information like what is this
[531.36 - 536.00] and then like I said before freak
[534.20 - 538.32] accidents and things like that and all
[536.00 - 542.12] kinds of stuff like what is and when you
[538.32 - 544.56] really when you guys chip chip away at
[542.12 - 545.92] this audio when you get it you just do a
[544.56 - 548.48] half an hour at a time that's what I
[545.92 - 551.76] mean by chipping away at it you just
[548.48 - 556.08] don't I probably wouldn't recommend
[551.76 - 559.52] doing the seven and a half hours all at
[556.08 - 560.84] once I probably wouldn't recommend that
[559.52 - 563.76] the Angels
[560.84 - 566.56] demons and spiritual tools
[563.76 - 570.96] audio I wouldn't do the seven and 1 half
[566.56 - 573.28] hours all at once I mean

[1241.92 - 1246.00] so let's let's get down to
[1247.00 - 1255.64] it let's get down to
[1250.48 - 1261.08] it bird flu think it's stupid no it's
[1255.64 - 1264.72] not bird flu think it's funny no it's
[1261.08 - 1266.60] not right now something's happening and
[1264.72 - 1268.40] people are not aware of it oh but I'm
[1266.60 - 1270.16] aware of the bird flu aw have heard
[1268.40 - 1273.20] about the bird flu many times different
[1270.16 - 1277.04] than any other bird flu it's a bird flu
[1273.20 - 1279.68] that's out there on
[1277.04 - 1281.64] purpose is that a crappy job that one
[1279.68 - 1284.48] right there it's a bird flu that's
[1281.64 - 1284.48] actually out there on
[1284.56 - 1289.80] purpose and it's out there for reason
[1288.36 - 1292.24] and and it's like there's a bad flu out
[1289.80 - 1295.24] there now right it's out there for a
[1292.24 - 1298.44] reason so that the bird flu and the flu
[1295.24 - 1302.68] come together and they produce something
[1298.44 - 1304.00] else like a mutation of a bird flu
[1302.68 - 1306.92] that's the
[1304.00 - 1309.96] goal anyway don't eat chicken is the
[1306.92 - 1311.40] name of this episode or you know stay
[1309.96 - 1314.44] away from chicken or whatever you want
[1311.40 - 1315.80] to call it keep chicken away so let's go
[1314.44 - 1318.68] into it a little
[1315.80 - 1320.68] bit I got a roasted chicken right here
[1318.68 - 1323.32] as you can see I also have some others
[1320.68 - 1324.72] chicken too I got some chicken tenders
[1323.32 - 1326.28] or whatever you want to call them I
[1324.72 - 1328.48] don't know what you call them I got some
[1326.28 - 1330.28] Buffalo WIS here as well just going to
[1328.48 - 1331.84] place them in front of us right here I
[1330.28 - 1333.64] got the white board we're going to talk
[1331.84 - 1336.16] about this stick around for this little
[1333.64 - 1338.56] talk cuz it's critical it is it's
[1336.16 - 1340.36] critical the bird flu was designed and
[1338.56 - 1342.68] manufactur it in a lab that's what it
[1340.36 - 1344.60] was it's not a natural occurring thing a
[1342.68 - 1347.12] bird can't catch a flu a bird doesn't
[1344.60 - 1349.32] produce a flu it doesn't work like that
[1347.12 - 1353.00] so it's not like a bird just suddenly
[1349.32 - 1355.04] came down with the flu the flu the Aven
[1353.00 - 1358.32] bird flu the bird
[1355.04 - 1360.52] flu the different strains of bird flu
[1358.32 - 1362.88] they just don't produce themselves they
[1360.52 - 1364.92] don't come out of nowhere they're put
[1362.88 - 1369.24] out there they're put out there in the
[1364.92 - 1370.96] crops and I'm just hinting to something
[1369.24 - 1372.72] but you
[1370.96 - 1375.32] know
[1372.72 - 1377.84] drones
[1375.32 - 1379.32] drones yeah sorry I don't know if you
[1377.84 - 1382.72] heard that right
[1379.32 - 1386.64] there but I have a bad cough I got the
[1382.72 - 1386.64] bird flu just kidding I don't have a bad
[1387.36 - 1391.88] cough how did that bird flu get out
[1393.36 - 1398.48] there
[1396.16 - 1400.44] um so the bird flu is put out there
[1398.48 - 1402.60] purposely so Birds catch it wild birds
[1400.44 - 1406.16] are catching it right now wild birds are
[1402.60 - 1407.80] they're falling out of the sky in droves
[1406.16 - 1410.08] geese are falling out of the sky in
[1407.80 - 1412.16] droves Just landing on highways right
[1410.08 - 1415.08] now people just don't realize this but
[1412.16 - 1417.72] it but it's happening geese are falling
[1415.08 - 1421.52] out of the
[1417.72 - 1424.84] sky ducks are falling out of the sky
[1421.52 - 1427.36] Robins are falling out of the sky yes
[1424.84 - 1429.44] Robins because the bird flu is designed
[1427.36 - 1433.44] to kill the bird it's not designed for
[1429.44 - 1437.24] the bird to survive birds don't normally
[1433.44 - 1439.04] survive a bird flu not this one now and
[1437.24 - 1441.24] not this one here
[1439.04 - 1444.20] when the bird catches the bird flu the
[1441.24 - 1447.56] bird dies the bird dies not because the
[1444.20 - 1451.56] bird's adrenals explode just like other
[1447.56 - 1453.80] flu and so forth and like ca right and
[1451.56 - 1456.64] the adrenals
[1453.80 - 1460.52] explode but bird the birds die from the
[1456.64 - 1465.16] bird flu because the bird flu virus goes
[1460.52 - 1466.36] after the cells of the bird after the
[1465.16 - 1469.64] organ
[1466.36 - 1473.80] cells after the muscle
[1469.64 - 1477.44] cells after the fat
[1473.80 - 1480.92] cells so the virus is designed to go and
[1477.44 - 1483.96] eat to go and feast on these cells to
[1480.92 - 1485.96] attack the cells on the deepest level
[1483.96 - 1488.64] the bird flu is designed that virus is
[1485.96 - 1491.20] designed to attack the bird's nervous
[1488.64 - 1495.12] system it's designed to attack the
[1491.20 - 1497.72] bird's brain and nerves that's why the
[1495.12 - 1500.20] birds suddenly get the bird flu and with
[1497.72 - 1502.36] an hour the bird just
[1500.20 - 1504.60] dies that's what's
[1502.36 - 1506.88] happening the reason why they're
[1504.60 - 1509.08] executing and killing so many birds
[1506.88 - 1511.72] right now so many different p in the
[1509.08 - 1513.36] poultry World agricultural the poultry
[1511.72 - 1515.92] world
[1513.36 - 1517.88] right the reason why they're killing so
[1515.92 - 1520.60] many is because they're watching the
[1517.88 - 1524.12] birds die that fast and it's scaring the
[1520.60 - 1526.16] crap out of everybody it's not like the
[1524.12 - 1527.96] birds are sick and you put these birds
[1526.16 - 1530.48] over here they're sick maybe these birds
[1527.96 - 1533.60] didn't catch the flu yet put them over
[1530.48 - 1535.44] here maybe in this you know in this pen
[1533.60 - 1537.24] here the birds didn't get it we just
[1535.44 - 1538.96] have Birds getting sick in this pen
[1537.24 - 1542.28] because they're dropping dead so fast
[1538.96 - 1544.48] it's scaring the crap out of people so
[1542.28 - 1546.52] they're killing millions and millions
[1544.48 - 1548.20] and millions of chickens right now
[1546.52 - 1550.20] you're seeing the egg prices go up
[1548.20 - 1553.52] you're seeing eggs get scarce and
[1550.20 - 1556.64] they're going to get scarcer and
[1553.52 - 1559.12] scarcer so the bird flu is interesting
[1556.64 - 1562.40] because it is jumping to humans to some
[1559.12 - 1565.76] degree but for a bird flu of this
[1562.40 - 1568.72] magnitude to do damage in a human in a
[1565.76 - 1572.28] human which it does when it does get
[1568.72 - 1577.00] into a human it needs another flu
[1572.28 - 1578.60] present so it needs two flu right needs
[1577.00 - 1582.60] another flu
[1578.60 - 1582.60] present so let's see what we got
[1584.04 - 1589.52] here so you got one
[1588.36 - 1590.76] I don't know if you guys could see this
[1589.52 - 1596.96] or
[1590.76 - 1601.60] not got another one okay that's one flu
[1596.96 - 1604.08] virus that's the human flu virus right
[1601.60 - 1606.40] there then you got the bird flu virus
[1604.08 - 1606.40] right
[1606.48 - 1614.36] there okay so the goal of the evildoers
[1611.40 - 1616.88] is to make sure the bird flu enters the
[1614.36 - 1618.72] body and has a good chance of being in
[1616.88 - 1620.32] the body at the same time time whether
[1618.72 - 1623.00] or not at the tail end but at the
[1620.32 - 1624.28] beginning of a human flu virus in the
[1623.00 - 1627.80] same
[1624.28 - 1627.80] body this is the
[1628.72 - 1635.04] goal you might not be able to see it too
[1631.20 - 1638.80] easily there you go how about
[1635.04 - 1641.76] that yep there we
[1638.80 - 1644.44] are what happens is they Spar for a
[1641.76 - 1647.68] little bit that's right they do a little
[1644.44 - 1647.68] bit of sparring
[1651.80 - 1657.04] okay they check each other out they size
[1655.76 - 1660.28] each other
[1657.04 - 1663.84] up they both don't want to
[1660.28 - 1667.52] die and they both want to challenge and
[1663.84 - 1667.52] trick out the human immune
[1668.32 - 1675.00] system so instead of one killing the
[1672.80 - 1678.68] other they
[1675.00 - 1680.20] transmute they connect they sequence
[1678.68 - 1682.60] because they're all about reproducing
[1680.20 - 1684.68] because that's what happens if you get
[1682.60 - 1688.08] one flu
[1684.68 - 1690.36] cell viral cell in
[1688.08 - 1693.36] you how does it
[1690.36 - 1695.88] work it reproduces
[1693.36 - 1698.92] itself to turn into a
[1695.88 - 1701.92] thousand to turn into hundreds of
[1698.92 - 1703.32] thousands so that when you sneeze you're
[1701.92 - 1709.24] spreading
[1703.32 - 1712.16] it it's out there right so it's done
[1709.24 - 1714.96] but these two
[1712.16 - 1716.72] viruses eventually will bond together so
[1714.96 - 1720.68] that's what the evildoers want they want
[1716.72 - 1724.28] them to bond together and then
[1720.68 - 1727.84] sequence what that means is they bond
[1724.28 - 1730.64] together and they reproduce a hybrid out
[1727.84 - 1733.92] of the human flu and the bird
[1730.64 - 1738.80] flu now that hybrid has information in
[1733.92 - 1742.04] it to destroy bird flesh
[1738.80 - 1746.52] to destroy bird flesh bird cells bird
[1742.04 - 1750.56] brain cells bird nerve cells that's the
[1746.52 - 1754.16] goal yes of the virus it's been
[1750.56 - 1758.48] engineered manufactured and raised in
[1754.16 - 1762.20] eggs to do so and then Place into birds
[1758.48 - 1764.12] in labs and they see enough Birds die
[1762.20 - 1769.44] they see birds die quick they want like
[1764.12 - 1773.04] a 90% death rate they want a 90 5% bird
[1769.44 - 1775.00] death rate when they see that then they
[1773.04 - 1778.96] get it out there they got different
[1775.00 - 1778.96] means of getting the bird flu out
[1781.40 - 1790.40] there different means of doing
[1785.12 - 1792.68] it so the goal is for people to carry a
[1790.40 - 1796.00] bird flu maybe without
[1792.68 - 1798.60] knowing and then pick up the flu that's
[1796.00 - 1801.24] going around
[1798.60 - 1805.88] yeah that they put out there
[1801.24 - 1809.64] too so they put both of them out
[1805.88 - 1809.64] there the goal
[1813.00 - 1816.96] is the goal
[1814.60 - 1819.68] [Laughter]
[1816.96 - 1822.92] is just
[1819.68 - 1826.68] laughing the goal is to get these two to
[1822.92 - 1828.48] se sequence and get them to cause a
[1826.68 - 1831.40] problem so what happens when the
[1828.48 - 1834.20] mutation starts we have a new bug that's
[1831.40 - 1836.20] the goal the mutation has a really high
[1834.20 - 1839.12] rate of killing
[1836.20 - 1842.04] people because it's with the human flu
[1839.12 - 1845.00] and it's the bird flu put together the
[1842.04 - 1848.52] ratio of the death rate will most likely
[1845.00 - 1851.08] be at 50% that's the goal so if you look
[1848.52 - 1853.68] at what 8 billion people on the planet
[1851.08 - 1856.56] or don't quote me on the number of the
[1853.68 - 1858.76] people on this Earth but say 8 billion
[1856.56 - 1862.12] roughly give or take
[1858.76 - 1863.32] four billion die that's the goal I'm not
[1862.12 - 1864.96] saying it's going to happen and I'm not
[1863.32 - 1869.16] saying it's happening
[1864.96 - 1871.88] now and I'm not saying God won't step in
[1869.16 - 1876.48] and I'm not saying the Angels won't step
[1871.88 - 1880.00] in and derail it and I'm not saying the
[1876.48 - 1885.28] light won't come in and derail it but
[1880.00 - 1885.28] that's what they're trying to do right
[1885.76 - 1891.28] now pretty crazy crap
[1889.44 - 1896.52] so I'm not saying don't eat chicken
[1891.28 - 1899.32] because I'm a person of vegan nature a
[1896.52 - 1901.36] vegan connoisseur plant-based person and
[1899.32 - 1903.08] I got all kinds of different propaganda
[1901.36 - 1905.32] lined up to try to get you guys to stop
[1903.08 - 1906.40] eating chicken you want to eat chicken
[1905.32 - 1908.56] eat
[1906.40 - 1910.12] chicken but I'm going to go into why we
[1908.56 - 1913.52] shouldn't eat chicken so we're going to
[1910.12 - 1917.28] head into that okay all
[1913.52 - 1920.48] right cooking the chicken doesn't help
[1917.28 - 1924.00] cook your chicken chicken cook your
[1920.48 - 1929.24] chicken I'll say that 100 times do not
[1924.00 - 1932.32] eat raw chicken do not eat raw chicken
[1929.24 - 1935.48] cook your chicken whatever you
[1932.32 - 1939.48] do Deborah I'm a nurse in hospital are
[1935.48 - 1943.72] full of influenza A and B by the
[1939.48 - 1945.76] way flu a patients right now so Deborah
[1943.72 - 1949.80] says she's a nurse and the hospitals are
[1945.76 - 1952.88] filled with influenza A
[1949.80 - 1954.52] Yep they're also filled with B they're
[1952.88 - 1957.72] also filled with
[1954.52 - 1961.48] Co and a few bird
[1957.72 - 1964.56] flu they release some bad flu that's why
[1961.48 - 1965.88] everybody's sick right now but the
[1964.56 - 1969.08] timing is
[1965.88 - 1972.08] purposeful they released some bad bird
[1969.08 - 1976.28] flow bird
[1972.08 - 1979.16] flu so they released you know more than
[1976.28 - 1981.92] one it g gives a greater chance for
[1979.16 - 1983.76] somebody get to get that bird flu not
[1981.92 - 1986.12] just somebody hundreds and hundreds of
[1983.76 - 1988.88] people and at the same time getting
[1986.12 - 1991.32] hundreds and hundreds of that flu the
[1988.88 - 1994.96] human flu the goal is to get those two
[1991.32 - 1998.88] to bond and mutate and make a deadly
[1994.96 - 2002.08] flu people say I can just eat the
[1998.88 - 2004.12] chicken and it will be okay how does
[2002.08 - 2009.60] that work does it work that way it's
[2004.12 - 2013.08] like this the more chicken you eat
[2009.60 - 2014.24] the more chances you're going to keep
[2013.08 - 2015.84] the bird
[2014.24 - 2018.16] flu
[2015.84 - 2021.48] active strong and
[2018.16 - 2023.12] Alive because pretty soon a lot of
[2021.48 - 2027.08] people are going to have the bird flu
[2023.12 - 2030.04] because it's jumping into people you
[2027.08 - 2032.56] don't want that chance for it to jump
[2030.04 - 2035.32] and then proliferate fast and not be
[2032.56 - 2038.64] killed off by your immune
[2035.32 - 2041.20] system the more bird flu gets around and
[2038.64 - 2044.00] spreads because it's feeding on chicken
[2041.20 - 2046.04] inside people's bodies the more chances
[2044.00 - 2048.48] it's going to get stronger and stick
[2046.04 - 2051.48] around longer to eventually make the
[2048.48 - 2053.96] sequence occur between the human flu and
[2051.48 - 2055.60] the bird flu cooking the chicken doesn't
[2053.96 - 2057.72] stop the problem that has nothing to do
[2055.60 - 2059.68] with it this isn't about eating a bad
[2057.72 - 2062.36] chicken that happens to have the bird
[2059.68 - 2064.92] flu this isn't about
[2062.36 - 2067.20] eating a roasted chicken right there
[2064.92 - 2069.36] like what's sitting there it's a buffalo
[2067.20 - 2071.16] chicken when wings or whatever it's not
[2069.36 - 2072.76] about eating those and saying well it
[2071.16 - 2074.52] was cooked good enough so the virus is
[2072.76 - 2076.80] dead it's not what it is I'm not talking
[2074.52 - 2080.20] about eating a chicken that has a virus
[2076.80 - 2083.04] that's not it at all the flu virus feeds
[2080.20 - 2085.84] on chicken flesh the bird flu virus
[2083.04 - 2087.20] feeds off of chicken flesh that's why
[2085.84 - 2090.04] the chickens are
[2087.20 - 2093.04] dying because it attacks every cell in
[2090.04 - 2095.36] the chicken and feeds off of it it eats
[2093.04 - 2097.84] it so when we have chicken in our livers
[2095.36 - 2100.32] Chicken in our bloodstream chicken in
[2097.84 - 2102.88] her guts chicken sitting in her colon
[2100.32 - 2105.96] for weeks and weeks and weeks for eating
[2102.88 - 2108.00] chicken three times a week twice a week
[2105.96 - 2110.00] once a week for eating chicken once a
[2108.00 - 2113.40] month if you eat chicken once a month
[2110.00 - 2115.12] you still have chicken in you that's it
[2113.40 - 2116.64] it it's not going to leave you if you
[2115.12 - 2118.04] eat chicken once a month just CU you
[2116.64 - 2120.60] went to the bathroom and you think you
[2118.04 - 2122.84] saw it on the way out doesn't
[2120.60 - 2125.16] mean you don't have chicken in your
[2122.84 - 2128.08] cells and inside your liver and chicken
[2125.16 - 2131.60] fat inside your body building inside
[2128.08 - 2133.68] your body it doesn't work that way so
[2131.60 - 2137.84] it's best to be free from chicken for
[2133.68 - 2140.32] quite a long time I'm not saying you
[2137.84 - 2142.40] can't eat a piece of chicken it's a good
[2140.32 - 2146.16] chance sure you'll be fine whatever you
[2142.40 - 2147.36] may not get the bird flu but there is
[2146.16 - 2149.76] going to be a
[2147.36 - 2151.68] mutation it is going to happen at some
[2149.76 - 2154.12] point is it going to be a real deadly
[2151.68 - 2156.64] deadly one very well could
[2154.12 - 2159.84] be is is there a possibility it won't be
[2156.64 - 2162.76] a real deadly one God intervenes yeah
[2159.84 - 2164.40] it's it's very possible but the chicken
[2162.76 - 2166.96] that's in your bloodstream and in your
[2164.40 - 2170.68] organs because so many people eat
[2166.96 - 2174.60] chicken talking about a
[2170.68 - 2177.20] crop that everybody just eats all the
[2174.60 - 2178.80] same it's crazy what's for dinner what's
[2177.20 - 2181.32] chicken okay well I'm having some
[2178.80 - 2183.64] asparagus but chicken I'm having some
[2181.32 - 2186.24] broccoli but it's chicken what you have
[2183.64 - 2187.68] for lunch Chicken on salad chicken salad
[2186.24 - 2189.96] you got chicken on your pizza heads it
[2187.68 - 2192.96] Chicken on my
[2189.96 - 2195.16] pizza anyway but the point is is that
[2192.96 - 2196.88] what people don't realize is everybody
[2195.16 - 2200.80] should stop eating chicken right now
[2196.88 - 2203.96] every single person should stop it's
[2200.80 - 2205.68] critical because a they're not going to
[2203.96 - 2207.24] stop no one's going to stop how many
[2205.68 - 2208.60] people are going to see this not
[2207.24 - 2210.80] probably the whole world isn't going to
[2208.60 - 2213.64] see this although the medical meem
[2210.80 - 2215.64] podcast reached a lot of people so the
[2213.64 - 2219.84] bird flu episode of the medical medum
[2215.64 - 2222.60] podcast reached a trrap ton of people
[2219.84 - 2224.56] around the world and that is still being
[2222.60 - 2226.76] listened to right now every single day
[2224.56 - 2230.44] every hour right now that one that one
[2226.76 - 2232.80] did really crazy out
[2230.44 - 2238.56] there all right so let's just let's just
[2232.80 - 2240.20] do a quick little um run through okay
[2238.56 - 2241.80] there's a bird flu released by The
[2240.20 - 2243.76] evildoers classified medical research
[2241.80 - 2246.04] and science they put the bird flu out
[2243.76 - 2247.92] there various different ways of
[2246.04 - 2249.60] contamination so Birds would get it
[2247.92 - 2251.36] birds Don't naturally get the bird flu
[2249.60 - 2253.40] it's impossible it's not possible for a
[2251.36 - 2255.16] bird to get the bird flu a bird can't
[2253.40 - 2256.64] just come down with the flu but for some
[2255.16 - 2259.36] reason they figured out ways of putting
[2256.64 - 2261.12] it out there drones drones nobody knew
[2259.36 - 2263.52] what the drones are
[2261.12 - 2265.40] for and they got it out there somehow
[2263.52 - 2267.32] whatever it is it's out there birds are
[2265.40 - 2270.08] getting it wild birds are dying all the
[2267.32 - 2272.72] time right now in massive droves and
[2270.08 - 2275.08] crops everywhere from both the crops of
[2272.72 - 2277.24] birds and Agland that are happening like
[2275.08 - 2279.84] the poultry and so forth the foul all
[2277.24 - 2281.76] that turkeys included are all dying out
[2279.84 - 2286.44] there but wild birds are dying like
[2281.76 - 2288.96] Robins crows and other birds
[2286.44 - 2290.76] too pretty soon at this rate the bird
[2288.96 - 2293.48] flu is taking over the planet there's a
[2290.76 - 2296.40] good chance if God doesn't intervene or
[2293.48 - 2298.60] it doesn't stop at some point in 3 to 5
[2296.40 - 2300.80] years all birds can be gone yes all
[2298.60 - 2303.20] birds can be gone on the
[2300.80 - 2305.64] planet all birds
[2303.20 - 2306.84] gone evildoers are putting the bird flu
[2305.64 - 2308.40] out there because they know it'll jump
[2306.84 - 2310.28] to humans they've actually designed it
[2308.40 - 2312.72] to have the ability to jump to a human
[2310.28 - 2315.80] even though it's not the normal process
[2312.72 - 2318.48] in which that virus works but people are
[2315.80 - 2320.08] getting that virus evildoers put out the
[2318.48 - 2321.44] other flu that's out there now there's a
[2320.08 - 2323.48] reason why hospitals are filled with
[2321.44 - 2325.76] that flu the timing is actually lined up
[2323.48 - 2327.28] perfectly that's what the evildoers did
[2325.76 - 2329.28] they put the bird flu out there they put
[2327.28 - 2331.12] the regular flu out there the human flu
[2329.28 - 2333.44] because there's a fantastic chance
[2331.12 - 2335.36] someone with the human flu is going to
[2333.44 - 2337.44] get the bird flu here and there and
[2335.36 - 2340.04] everywhere including yes men and women
[2337.44 - 2342.24] women working at bird
[2340.04 - 2344.56] factories chicken
[2342.24 - 2347.48] factories egg
[2344.56 - 2349.20] factories those people pick it up first
[2347.48 - 2351.80] they end up picking up the bird flu from
[2349.20 - 2354.04] the birds then they pick up the human
[2351.80 - 2355.64] flu and they know that the amount of
[2354.04 - 2357.16] chicken factories around the world and
[2355.64 - 2358.56] bird factories around the world they
[2357.16 - 2360.36] know there's going to be an incredible
[2358.56 - 2362.28] chance for that to happen from the
[2360.36 - 2363.60] workers working in these places that
[2362.28 - 2365.04] they're going to eventually pick up the
[2363.60 - 2366.84] human flu
[2365.04 - 2368.36] somewhere and they're going to pick up
[2366.84 - 2369.92] that human flu and they're going to pick
[2368.36 - 2371.20] up the bird flu at the same time and
[2369.92 - 2372.76] those are going to be the first people
[2371.20 - 2375.80] sending out the mutations it's going to
[2372.76 - 2377.52] be the people working in the bird
[2375.80 - 2379.12] factories in the chicken factories and
[2377.52 - 2381.04] so forth hen houses and everything else
[2379.12 - 2382.72] for egg production and everything else
[2381.04 - 2384.44] those people are going to go out one
[2382.72 - 2386.12] night to a bar whatever they going to do
[2384.44 - 2387.60] on Friday night they're going to pick up
[2386.12 - 2390.16] the influenza that's actually going
[2387.60 - 2391.92] around right now then they're going to
[2390.16 - 2393.20] go back to work on Monday and they're
[2391.92 - 2394.40] going to pick up the bird flu and
[2393.20 - 2396.72] they're going to have both those flu
[2394.40 - 2398.68] inside of them and evildoers know this
[2396.72 - 2401.00] eventually a mutation is going to be
[2398.68 - 2402.64] sprung because both these viruses don't
[2401.00 - 2404.80] want to kill themselves they want to
[2402.64 - 2408.56] work together so they Spar they learn
[2404.80 - 2411.00] about each other and then boom they
[2408.56 - 2413.84] sequence when they
[2411.00 - 2416.24] sequence that's when the mess happens
[2413.84 - 2418.68] they create a virus that a wants to kill
[2416.24 - 2422.16] every chicken and bird there is in the
[2418.68 - 2425.56] world and now wants to kill humans more
[2422.16 - 2427.04] than ever before so now the flu becomes
[2425.56 - 2429.52] something different between the bird flu
[2427.04 - 2432.40] and that flu put together it becomes a
[2429.52 - 2436.96] bug that wants to kill people at
[2432.40 - 2436.96] probably a 50% die off
[2437.96 - 2443.80] rate that's the goal and that's what
[2440.40 - 2446.72] they're doing what I recommend is stop
[2443.80 - 2448.76] eating chicken completely stop I think
[2446.72 - 2451.88] everyone on the planet should stop
[2448.76 - 2458.04] eating turkeys and chickens and quails
[2451.88 - 2460.08] and pheasants and Ducks who eats ducks
[2458.04 - 2464.16] you always find somebody in a restaurant
[2460.08 - 2464.16] fine dining like I'll have the
[2468.16 - 2472.08] duck and yes there are some people that
[2470.36 - 2474.12] have contracted the bird flu like I said
[2472.08 - 2476.64] before already and you just got to line
[2474.12 - 2479.20] it up just right what I'm talking about
[2476.64 - 2481.00] is the mutation that is coming not the
[2479.20 - 2483.00] bird flu that's out there in the moment
[2481.00 - 2484.84] but the mutation between the bird flu
[2483.00 - 2487.44] and the human flu and that mutation and
[2484.84 - 2489.00] what's coming now there's a chance that
[2487.44 - 2492.20] not come and there's a chance that it
[2489.00 - 2495.40] just might not happen and I would say
[2492.20 - 2495.40] for sure that's God's
[2495.88 - 2500.16] intervention but it could happen still
[2498.16 - 2502.20] all the same the reason why you want to
[2500.16 - 2503.84] stop eating chicken or any kind of birds
[2502.20 - 2505.72] is because you don't want that inside
[2503.84 - 2507.72] your cells you don't want chicken in
[2505.72 - 2509.64] your cells yes it doesn't just go in
[2507.72 - 2511.20] your mouth and your stomach down your
[2509.64 - 2512.92] dadum and your small intestinal tract
[2511.20 - 2513.80] your colon and out the other end and
[2512.92 - 2516.48] it's
[2513.80 - 2518.84] gone it actually sits in your body it
[2516.48 - 2520.96] takes months to get get it out months
[2518.84 - 2523.52] you should do a cleanse maybe go to Cafe
[2520.96 - 2525.24] Gratitude do a wellness reset cleanse
[2523.52 - 2528.20] maybe pick up a medical medium book do
[2525.24 - 2530.40] one of those cleanses 369 and get the
[2528.20 - 2532.12] chicken out of your bloodstream get it
[2530.40 - 2533.92] out of your liver get it out of your
[2532.12 - 2536.56] cells get it out of your
[2533.92 - 2539.52] bones so that you're free from that
[2536.56 - 2542.16] being in you and the best thing could
[2539.52 - 2544.68] have ever ever happened right now is
[2542.16 - 2546.52] eggs being scarce and egg prices going
[2544.68 - 2548.12] up unless it's the only food you can eat
[2546.52 - 2549.88] for some reason cuz you have a medical
[2548.12 - 2551.92] condition and so all you can eat is eggs
[2549.88 - 2555.32] Blended in a blender or something like
[2551.92 - 2558.00] that but the point is is it's a good
[2555.32 - 2560.80] thing eggs are getting
[2558.00 - 2562.88] scarcer and it's hard to get
[2560.80 - 2565.00] eggs because nobody should be eating
[2562.88 - 2567.96] eggs or chicken right now because of
[2565.00 - 2570.12] what the plan is and what they're
[2567.96 - 2571.68] doing and if you think it sounds crazy
[2570.12 - 2573.28] or anything like okay good just think of
[2571.68 - 2577.56] it as just a fun story we're just having
[2573.28 - 2577.56] fun today that's fine with me
[2579.24 - 2582.12] anyway so what I recommend is get rid of
[2581.44 - 2585.88] the
[2582.12 - 2585.88] chicken so here's how it
[2596.96 - 2600.84] works you guys like my art
[2604.16 - 2611.16] skills I'm an artist
[2607.56 - 2612.84] here's how it works you eat the
[2611.16 - 2615.68] chicken
[2612.84 - 2617.76] okay some of the chicken fat gets
[2615.68 - 2619.92] absorbed through the mouth yeah believe
[2617.76 - 2621.44] it or not lots of different chemicals
[2619.92 - 2623.28] and hormones in the chicken you don't
[2621.44 - 2625.24] eat chicken with hormones but yes you do
[2623.28 - 2627.80] every single chicken has hormones in it
[2625.24 - 2629.64] every single chicken does hormones get
[2627.80 - 2632.44] absorbed into your
[2629.64 - 2634.76] mouth from eating the chicken already
[2632.44 - 2637.44] you got the hormones what the bird flu
[2634.76 - 2640.16] loves is the hormones now actually
[2637.44 - 2642.16] occurring hormones in organic chicken
[2640.16 - 2644.16] whatever free range chicken it's one
[2642.16 - 2646.20] thing that occurs the virus will feed
[2644.16 - 2648.20] off those hormones you swallow the
[2646.20 - 2651.92] chicken it's in your stomach right
[2648.20 - 2653.72] now okay your HCL is breaking it apart
[2651.92 - 2656.52] starting to dissolve and break the
[2653.72 - 2658.68] proteins down cuz that's what your HCL
[2656.52 - 2660.20] does if you got strong HCL if you don't
[2658.68 - 2662.04] the proteins just sit there rot in your
[2660.20 - 2664.44] gut and then you're fermenting got
[2662.04 - 2665.76] fermented putrified chicken carcass in
[2664.44 - 2668.04] your gut and that's what's happening
[2665.76 - 2670.60] this isn't vegan propag has nothing to
[2668.04 - 2672.56] do with that I would if you're somebody
[2670.60 - 2674.32] that's eating chick chicken all the time
[2672.56 - 2677.20] and you need you you feel like you need
[2674.32 - 2681.32] an animal protein to move on to beef
[2677.20 - 2684.48] grass-fed beef that flu virus that bird
[2681.32 - 2686.80] flu virus doesn't want
[2684.48 - 2690.12] beef chicken's in here and it breaks
[2686.80 - 2691.96] down it starts breaking down okay and
[2690.12 - 2694.28] then it moves down the dadum into the
[2691.96 - 2697.32] small intestinal tract and breaks down
[2694.28 - 2701.12] even more and then
[2697.32 - 2702.56] that chicken part of it Li liquifies
[2701.12 - 2704.16] gets into the liver through the paddock
[2702.56 - 2707.80] portal Highway goes right up into the
[2704.16 - 2710.52] liver right here and it sits in the
[2707.80 - 2715.04] liver fat from the chicken is dispersed
[2710.52 - 2716.92] by guess what your bile reserves your
[2715.04 - 2719.60] bile actually starts to break down the
[2716.92 - 2722.92] fats and disperses the fats that goes
[2719.60 - 2725.28] all through the body gets into the
[2722.92 - 2727.24] liver and then gets through into
[2725.28 - 2728.64] everywhere else as well so so when
[2727.24 - 2731.36] you're when you're sitting there and you
[2728.64 - 2735.44] got chicken now inside your gut and it's
[2731.36 - 2737.84] being dissolved by your gastric juices
[2735.44 - 2741.56] and dissolved by your
[2737.84 - 2745.56] bile it ends up everywhere in your body
[2741.56 - 2748.68] your brain your nervous system something
[2745.56 - 2751.48] from that chicken ends up somewhere
[2748.68 - 2754.96] everywhere your bone marrow your liver
[2751.48 - 2754.96] and it takes time to get it
[2755.44 - 2763.80] out when the day comes that these two
[2759.80 - 2766.76] viruses become one and mutate and we
[2763.80 - 2770.48] have a deadly bird
[2766.76 - 2770.48] flu you're going to
[2770.60 - 2775.44] want you
[2772.44 - 2778.00] know I think we have a tech problem with
[2775.44 - 2780.40] Tik Tock I think they boot at me
[2778.00 - 2785.52] again you're going to want chicken out
[2780.40 - 2785.52] of your body you'll have the greatest
[2785.92 - 2792.64] chance to push that virus out of your
[2788.76 - 2793.52] body the greatest chance and you'll have
[2792.64 - 2796.92] a
[2793.52 - 2799.44] survival opportunity as
[2796.92 - 2801.96] well the evildoers are relying on the
[2799.44 - 2804.28] amount of chicken people eat the amount
[2801.96 - 2806.48] of chicken people eat we guarantee that
[2804.28 - 2809.64] the virus will be even more hungrier and
[2806.48 - 2809.64] deadlier and cause more
[2811.72 - 2815.72] damage anyway
[2846.20 - 2848.84] so
[2854.16 - 2857.64] you guys got to watch this from the
[2855.56 - 2860.16] beginning definitely have to watch it
[2857.64 - 2864.44] from the beginning without a doubt
[2860.16 - 2864.44] okay and I think the phone is
[2865.12 - 2869.12] ringing um
[2888.48 - 2893.08] but anyway about the bird flu and stuff
[2890.16 - 2895.96] that's only if the viruses mutate like I
[2893.08 - 2899.20] said God's intervention will definitely
[2895.96 - 2901.52] kick in and it's probably not going to
[2899.20 - 2903.12] happen but I'm just saying that's how it
[2901.52 - 2905.24] works with the bird flu talked about it
[2903.12 - 2907.24] on the medical beam podcast check it out
[2905.24 - 2909.24] when you can

[2996.28 - 2999.32] right
[2998.16 - 3002.40] that's the thing you
[2999.32 - 3003.52] know as far as what people have to you
[3002.40 - 3005.32] have to understand something about the
[3003.52 - 3008.44] chicken and everything else you keep it
[3005.32 - 3009.88] away and that literally right there
[3008.44 - 3011.92] gives you a lot of protection and people
[3009.88 - 3012.60] don't realize that and that's how great
[3011.92 - 3014.88] it
[3012.60 - 3017.60] is I'm reading
[3014.88 - 3020.08] comments seriously folks this guy is
[3017.60 - 3021.80] talking nonsense about viruses eat free
[3020.08 - 3026.80] range chicken if you
[3021.80 - 3029.24] like and kick fear into touch
[3026.80 - 3032.04] oh good advice go
[3029.24 - 3033.48] ahead anyway it's not vegan propaganda I
[3032.04 - 3035.24] saw somebody saying ah it's vegan
[3033.48 - 3039.00] propaganda it's not what it
[3035.24 - 3042.36] is I've been told this for decades and
[3039.00 - 3046.48] proven right over and over with so much
[3042.36 - 3048.00] information so anyway well look let's
[3046.48 - 3050.00] hope nothing happens and that's the
[3048.00 - 3054.84] whole point there's a good chance it
[3050.00 - 3054.84] won't but the goal is to create
[3055.04 - 3058.76] problems and I could just keep the
[3057.04 - 3061.44] information to
[3058.76 - 3062.84] myself but how great would that be I
[3061.44 - 3065.24] want to make sure people have that

[3334.84 - 3340.44] covid yeah I know I I I did and I talked
[3337.88 - 3345.16] also about a bunch of other stuff
[3340.44 - 3346.64] too before Co came who what else so
[3345.16 - 3347.44] you're not even allowed to still say
[3346.64 - 3349.60] that

[3410.28 - 3415.12] long flu and how it works you get the
[3412.64 - 3417.04] flu and then the flu lowers the immune
[3415.12 - 3420.08] system and the immune system
[3417.04 - 3422.24] system gets dropped and then it allows
[3420.08 - 3426.52] EP bars and all these other things just

[3998.48 - 4002.68] just want to say okay Charlie said that
[4000.72 - 4005.24] I didn't give Charlie any chance to talk
[4002.68 - 4008.48] at all
[4005.24 - 4010.68] um Charlie says that Dr nesbit's goingon
[4008.48 - 4010.68] to
[4011.84 - 4020.32] call I'm just waiting drth going to call
[4016.96 - 4020.32] there's a phone over
[4022.72 - 4027.76] here just waiting for Dr n to call right
[4036.24 - 4040.20] here Charlie I haven't been able to say
[4038.88 - 4041.44] a lot of things that you're saying
[4040.20 - 4042.92] because a lot of the things you're
[4041.44 - 4045.16] saying are just quite crazy you're
[4042.92 - 4047.08] talking about Donnie the donkey and
[4045.16 - 4048.84] you're talking talking about Piggy and
[4047.08 - 4050.52] you're talking about all the crazy stuff
[4048.84 - 4052.08] that happens between Donnie the donkey
[4050.52 - 4053.76] and piggy because you hang out with them
[4052.08 - 4055.00] and Dr nbut doesn't hang out with them
[4053.76 - 4057.60] anymore because he's doing too many
[4055.00 - 4060.96] surgeries so I understand that so what
[4057.60 - 4063.20] do you want to say about
[4060.96 - 4067.24] piggy piggy poos
[4063.20 - 4069.52] everywhere even in your your house so
[4067.24 - 4071.20] piggy comes and poos right on the floor
[4069.52 - 4073.56] and then then
[4071.20 - 4076.52] what you have to ask for help to clean
[4073.56 - 4077.92] it up okay okay you wanted to tell them
[4076.52 - 4080.84] that that's what you really wanted to
[4077.92 - 4082.64] say and that's why Dr Nesbit might be a
[4080.84 - 4086.96] better fit he has to get better from the
[4082.64 - 4091.20] bird flu what else and Donnie the
[4086.96 - 4092.52] donkey he overeats really and he threw
[4091.20 - 4095.04] up in the car
[4092.52 - 4097.68] again Don donkey threw up in the car
[4095.04 - 4099.64] again and piggy poops all over the floor
[4097.68 - 4101.60] at Charlie's house so Charlie just
[4099.64 - 4104.24] wanted that across because Charlie's
[4101.60 - 4107.24] hoping to embarrass them to get them
[4104.24 - 4107.24] back
[4110.20 - 4115.72] okay well I think that was very
[4112.36 - 4116.72] productive and um quite useful right
[4115.72 - 4122.04] wouldn't you
[4116.72 - 4122.04] say trying to save lives here
