1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,290
are you talking about foods that get us

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,450
in trouble and how important this is

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,150
foods that get us in trouble and what

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,710
it's all about so we're you know on the

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,230
medical medium number one New York Times

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,929
bestselling author of the medical medium

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,760
book series on healing people around the

8
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,500
globe books are all over the globe

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,240
helping people heal today I'm going to

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,390
talk a little bit about thyroid healing

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,830
and the epstein-barr virus too so I'm

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,380
covering deep into the epstein-barr

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,179
virus information no one's ever heard

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,030
before information that since I were

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,460
healing plus some other little tidbits

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,610
about it but I'm gonna go into foods -

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,290
foods that get us in trouble and why

18
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,180
they get us in trouble because it's so

19
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,770
important when you're sick and you're

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,110
struggling and you're suffering with so

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,079
many different symptoms and conditions

22
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:52,170
it's critical to know you guys what

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,600
foods can make it worse not because of a

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,640
theory not because of a theory out there

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,649
like avoid gluten because you know

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,500
inflammation but that nobody knows

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,930
anything about it or avoid dairy

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,240
products because of lactose intolerance

29
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,080
or it's mucus forming we're gonna go

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,820
into like the real reasons the true

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,030
causes to why foods get us in trouble

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,950
and how we stay sick and how that

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,869
affects our lives and where that gets us

34
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,030
in all of it so this is really an

35
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,860
important important show in episode

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,390
probably one of the most critical

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,880
episodes so we're gonna go into the

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,060
epstein-barr virus is responsible for a

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,530
lot of things and this is a critical

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,240
aspect of it because when you know what

41
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,400
its responsible for then you can

42
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,259
actually learn and how to heal it's the

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
most comprehensive book as I read

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,610
healing about the epstein-barr virus out

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,189
there this is the virus with over 60

46
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,170
varieties of mutations and strains so

47
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,649
what does that mean that means it's not

48
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,320
just one virus one pathogen that's what

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,619
it means it means that we have lots of

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,420
one kind see how it goes so that's an

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,549
important thing to know right there

52
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,920
because what that means is it's hard to

53
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,259
detect hard to find hard for doctors to

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,899
see it hard for bloodwork to even show

55
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,940
it all of the above it also means that

56
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,310
they're not on the radar of research and

57
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,010
science so when viruses mutate in

58
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,870
homes they actually become a little

59
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,400
different form of themselves creating

60
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:21,910
different illnesses and they have

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,099
different appetites towards foods that's

62
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,370
why what I was saying is foods that get

63
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,800
us in trouble because bugs actually eat

64
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,260
food so we're gonna cover all of this in

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,910
detail and you know and this is powerful

66
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,470
information you don't want to miss this

67
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,019
you want to stay on for this this is

68
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,239
gonna be really important so look

69
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,069
epstein-barr is responsible for a lot of

70
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,670
symptoms and conditions Hashimoto's

71
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,690
Graves

72
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,510
CFS ms hypothyroidism all of the next

73
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:52,120
most rises that'll I go anxiety even

74
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:55,209
depression and you know symptoms vertigo

75
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,970
tinnitus brain fog PCOS endometriosis

76
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,569
and that's just that's just a little bit

77
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,819
of it

78
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,019
EB V is responsible for a lot of

79
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:04,150
different things people are going

80
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:05,680
through so if you're saying to yourself

81
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,910
hey wait a minute I have balance issues

82
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,890
I have a little bit of her to go I have

83
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,019
some tinnitus I have different died

84
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,599
popping in the ears I have twitches and

85
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,099
tingles and numbness and I have fatigue

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
that the doctors not sure what it's

87
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,959
about they think it's my adrenals or

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,880
they're not sure I've seen bars

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,620
responsible for these and so much more

90
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,859
and that's why it's so it's so important

91
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,870
many people think I just believe evb

92
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,970
causes everything and they take issue

93
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,739
with that and I completely understand I

94
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,970
do I completely understand and it comes

95
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,850
down to one thing

96
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,650
so when critics skeptics think that I'm

97
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,019
all about epstein-barr and epstein-barr

98
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,840
only comes down to one thing those

99
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,510
critics haven't read the medical medium

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,970
books they haven't read the books it's

101
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,920
so important and many people think of

102
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,750
the celery juice guy and that's what it

103
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,660
is so it's all about celery juice and

104
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,030
celery juice only by the way okay come

105
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,630
buy celery juice right here and it's not

106
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,980
a real big one today but that's alright

107
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,420
so many people think I'm just a celery

108
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,370
juice guy to the guy that started the

109
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,639
celery juice movement around the world

110
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,560
and sure okay that's that that's true

111
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,109
but it's not that's not what I just

112
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,470
damned so what they don't understand is

113
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:20,620
that epstein-barr is not just one virus

114
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,169
creating people sicknesses it's the over

115
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,870
60 varieties

116
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:27,810
and they haven't read the medical medium

117
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,370
books to learn that information so it's

118
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,870
easy for a critic to just pop that out

119
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,699
there and say oh he's all about I've

120
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,219
seen but I don't even know about the 60

121
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,129
varieties and strains and mutations and

122
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:40,439
so it's really important seeing each

123
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:42,960
mutation does different things it's a

124
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,340
different beast so every mutation is a

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,050
different beast causing different

126
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,360
symptoms and conditions and that's

127
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,490
what's so important to know this means

128
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,849
that there's over 60 different pathogens

129
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,120
under the label epstein-barr so that's

130
00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:01,229
why not just one virus not just one

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,199
pathogen under the label epstein-barr so

132
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:06,259
and each one has a different appetite it

133
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,759
likes to feed off of different foods

134
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,860
they all like the feed off of eggs and I

135
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,539
talked about that earlier so I tucked

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,129
that with why eggs make you sick in the

137
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,870
last you tube but you've got to see the

138
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,060
last one and I have an egg in front of

139
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,439
me right here but there's a lot of

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,699
different varieties of epstein-barr they

141
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,550
feed off of different foods and

142
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,389
everybody has different varieties that's

143
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,330
how it works

144
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,520
and so for example some varieties of

145
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,279
epstein-barr really love toxic heavy

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,229
metals so they like copper so here's how

147
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,150
it goes with eczema and psoriasis and

148
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,770
these I discussed these in thyroid

149
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,180
healing I discuss all these different

150
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,349
symptoms conditions and illnesses and

151
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,389
thyroid healing if you don't have this

152
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:43,979
book get it and educate yourself and and

153
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,979
be able to protect yourself and your

154
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:48,509
family it's so important so when the

155
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,300
Epstein when a variety of epstein-barr

156
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:54,449
virus likes copper sets the toxic heavy

157
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,789
metal that sits inside our liver it it

158
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,949
actually consumes it feeds off of it

159
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,199
releases it and when it releases it it

160
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:02,969
releases a powerful Dermott oxen that

161
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,409
floats through the bloodstream unknown a

162
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,349
research in science floats through the

163
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,969
bloodstream its services to skin and

164
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:10,740
when it surfaces to the skin the body

165
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,349
tries to push it out and that's what

166
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,099
causes eczema and psoriasis and that's

167
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,080
one variety of epstein-barr and so you

168
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,789
know what they what the race bridge

169
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,169
research in science loves to say is that

170
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,759
your body's attacking itself that your

171
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,529
body's attacking its own skin which is

172
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,029
impossible the body doesn't work like

173
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,680
that I can go into that a little bit

174
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,469
more later some varieties of

175
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,730
epstein-barr you guys likes mercury and

176
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:35,310
everybody has

177
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,170
in them everybody has certain levels of

178
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,880
mercury the toxic heavy metal mercury in

179
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,880
them is why I love the heavy metal detox

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,430
movie so I'm not just all about the

181
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,530
epstein-barr all about celery juice the

182
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,680
heavy metal detox loubies critical if

183
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,780
you want to heal it's so important and I

184
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,910
want you to know that so the medical

185
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,190
medium heavy metal detox movie is so

186
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,110
important and I could talk about that a

187
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,200
little bit later too so when a virus

188
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,780
like epstein-barr loves mercury when it

189
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,950
feeds off of it it releases instead of a

190
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,020
derma stalks in so much it releases a

191
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,640
neurotoxin so when it consumes the foods

192
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,470
it likes which I'm going into it why

193
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,110
foods get us in trouble I'm gonna go

194
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:19,110
into that a little bit it consumes the

195
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,790
foods it likes releases it eliminates it

196
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,460
goes to bathroom like we go to bathroom

197
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,350
when we eat okay viruses have to go to

198
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,150
bathroom pathogens have to go to the

199
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,820
bathroom and when it goes to the

200
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,030
bathroom it releases a potent powerful

201
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,250
neurotoxin and that neurotoxin floats

202
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,970
around in the bloodstream and wreaks

203
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,940
havoc on what its neurotoxic so it

204
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:45,030
wreaks havoc on the nervous system a

205
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,010
central nervous system now most of these

206
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,050
Epstein bars release a little bit of

207
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,150
derma tox ins along with it if you have

208
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,250
a little copper inside of you if you

209
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,400
have a little aluminum inside of you and

210
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:58,440
so you may get the combination of

211
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:01,800
neurological symptoms like fatigue which

212
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,410
is a neurological symptom or you may get

213
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,930
fatigue and a little bit of rashing

214
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,200
which could be very mild axilla or

215
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,480
patches rashes like lupus like when

216
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,070
people get diagnosed with lupus not just

217
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,900
the butterfly rashes but the different

218
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,090
rashes that's because you have the

219
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,680
neurotoxin surfacing and the derma

220
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,110
stalks in so that variety of

221
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,150
epstein-barr releases these especially

222
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,920
the neurotoxin it gives you the fatigue

223
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,970
it gives you problems like that you can

224
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,950
get diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

225
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,230
Lyme disease lupus chronic fatigue

226
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,440
syndrome and me so that's what the virus

227
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,810
does so this is powerful information

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,419
this empowers you this can take you out

229
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,130
of literally the hell of suffering this

230
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,830
information because it has it already

231
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,060
has for millions of people globally for

232
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,010
over 30 years

233
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,360
been doing this for 35 years helping

234
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,090
people get better with this information

235
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,040
that comes from my source so it's

236
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,140
important to have this so you can

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,540
actually move forward is this an about

238
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,330
anything else besides you healing it's

239
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,670
critical to know that so some varieties

240
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,279
of epstein-barr virus like the feed off

241
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,529
of cell tissue itself so they like the

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,089
feed off of cell tissue so instead of

243
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,060
just feeding off of a toxic heavy metals

244
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,150
like mercury or aluminum the virus likes

245
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,410
to feed off of your cell tissue so

246
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:18,330
thyroid disorders Hashimoto's

247
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,310
thyroiditis the inflammation that's

248
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,589
caused inside the thyroid and I talked

249
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,820
about that really really clearly if I

250
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:28,650
were healing okay and that what happens

251
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,290
is that variety of virus feeds off of

252
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,750
cells cells inside your thyroid and it

253
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,180
causes inflammation see it's not your

254
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,370
body attacking itself like they want you

255
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,870
to believe because that disempowers you

256
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,390
want to go into that a little later how

257
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,010
that that body shames and disempowers

258
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,260
and just really makes people feel like

259
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,820
the faulty really makes people feel like

260
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,000
they're worthless so I'm going to go

261
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:54,030
into how that works later on so when a

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,830
virus feeds off of cell tissue in like

263
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,990
forensic example feeds off of your

264
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,640
thyroid cell tissue you can get the

265
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,860
thyroid asaurus hyperthyroidism

266
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,380
Hashimoto's thyroiditis you get the

267
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,440
beginning stages of hypothyroidism and

268
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,030
you can be you could get the stages of

269
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,370
nodules you can get the stages of cysts

270
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,170
thyroid cancer so that's one variety of

271
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,610
epstein-barr many of them go to the

272
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,110
thyroid so many of them go to the

273
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,990
thyroid and do different things in the

274
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,550
thyroid so the viruses have mutated over

275
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,400
time there's over 60 varieties like I

276
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:26,070
talked about before but that's one type

277
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,839
and then you've got the aluminum feeding

278
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,850
viruses which is the epstein-barr

279
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,190
variety that loves aluminum and guess

280
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:35,850
where that goes to guess what happens

281
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:39,420
when that virus has an aluminum you know

282
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,950
desire and it eats aluminum and what

283
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,290
happens there is you end up with

284
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,690
vitiligo you end up with the white spots

285
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,020
the discoloration because here's how it

286
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,240
works so important to know this and the

287
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,160
virus feeds off of aluminum which sits

288
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,180
inside the liver that's where all our

289
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,860
toxic heavy metals go in that's why

290
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,480
say hey you guys you got to get rid of

291
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,870
your toxic heavy metals it's so

292
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,030
important and it matters so much that's

293
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,920
why I want you to do that really huddle

294
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,230
up look good good spirulina I always

295
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,300
talk about all the good stuff that you

296
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,070
need and and how the heavy metal detox

297
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,900
smoothie and the wild blueberries and

298
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,400
all of it because you've got to get rid

299
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,530
of the toxic heavy metals out of your

300
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,420
liver because when aluminum is sitting

301
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,700
inside the body and sitting inside the

302
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,010
liver you guys what happens is that

303
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:26,050
variety of epstein-barr loves to feed

304
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,940
off of it and when it eliminates it goes

305
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,520
to the bathroom and releases it it

306
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,440
floats around it surfaces to the skin

307
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,870
and it kills the melanin pigment cells

308
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,000
it destroys them and that's why you get

309
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:40,660
the spots the white spots everywhere

310
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,600
that's that variety of virus so you know

311
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,610
these are some examples of you know

312
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,320
foods that these different varieties of

313
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,430
epstein-barr like to feed on in the

314
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,500
moment I'm going to show you some other

315
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,330
foods and that's that's that's gonna be

316
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,280
a big one today - a big part of today so

317
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,630
you want to stay on for this this is you

318
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,240
don't want to miss this this is gonna be

319
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:01,480
really fun - look we eat to stay alive

320
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,210
we have to stay alive or we die okay

321
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,240
that's how it works here so does every

322
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:10,240
single packaging every single micro

323
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,760
organism on the planet living organism

324
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,350
has to eat something so when science

325
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,640
research keeps that all from you and

326
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,190
they don't tell you that they use

327
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,600
Mercury to keep these things alive in

328
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:24,220
labs that they feed all these bugs eggs

329
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
okay like I said and why eggs make you

330
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,190
sick if you haven't seen them and you

331
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,900
got to go back to that one and look at

332
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,350
that YouTube you know when you can at

333
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,410
that episode after this but so because

334
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,630
these these bugs need food so critical

335
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,820
to know every single living

336
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,140
microorganism viruses and different

337
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,090
varieties of viruses like different

338
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,040
foods this is advanced medical

339
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,690
information straight from my source that

340
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,390
public research and science is unaware

341
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,890
of yet and it's so important so when I'm

342
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,360
talking about what foods get us in

343
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,580
trouble and how foods get us in trouble

344
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,160
and all that one I talk about that later

345
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,020
it's advanced food information that

346
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,430
isn't out there because no one knows

347
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,810
they're all playing guessing games and

348
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,450
they don't know why foods really make

349
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,610
you sick so this is so great to notice

350
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:10,660
Nathan's been delivering it for years

351
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,750
and years okay so viruses take different

352
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,850
pathways so I'm going to talk about the

353
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,040
pathways where they go from the liver to

354
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,250
the thyroid to the ovaries different

355
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,440
areas okay one variety of epstein-barr

356
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,300
goes from the liver to the thyroid so

357
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,490
let's talk about that now we're heading

358
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,030
we're gonna head into that and then

359
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:34,660
what's left of that virus goes to the

360
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,660
ovaries and creates PCOS so PCOS a

361
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,240
reproductive condition okay a cystic

362
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,610
reproductive condition is caused by

363
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,090
epstein-barr that's what creates assist

364
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,550
assist a fluid-filled cysts cannot be

365
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,130
created on its own it doesn't work like

366
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,410
that I know they want people to believe

367
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,360
that it's the woman's body that's faulty

368
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,050
if something must be wrong with her and

369
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,930
then she's causing it I know this is the

370
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,660
medical system big pharma and you know

371
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,180
whoever else wants women to believe that

372
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,130
but see a fluid-filled cysts can't

373
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,520
develop on its own it doesn't work that

374
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,710
way there has to be a cause and there is

375
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,030
the epstein-barr virus and does go to

376
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,370
the ovaries it goes a reproductive

377
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,660
system it causes a lot of reproductive

378
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:23,380
problems I'm going to talk about that a

379
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,240
little later too so then also the the

380
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,800
epstein-barr virus it's inside the liver

381
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,360
and it goes straight to the fiber it

382
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,640
goes to travels to the thyroid it

383
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,920
creates hypothyroidism later for women

384
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,930
and and it can create it years later

385
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,570
somebody could have a milder form of

386
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,160
epstein-barr virus and it could create

387
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:40,720
hyperthyroidism years later somebody

388
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,580
could have a much more much more

389
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,380
aggressive variety on the 60 varieties

390
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,270
and it could create problems even more

391
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,040
aggressively coughs and bam you get the

392
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,360
worst Hashimoto's thyroiditis you're

393
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,860
really sick you're at the doctor's

394
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
office doctors telling you it's your

395
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,670
body attacking itself it's listed under

396
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,740
not on the in condition when really you

397
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,240
have a viral infection and that's what

398
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,790
it really is talking about thyroid

399
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,810
healing - incredible book to have if you

400
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,550
don't have it you got to go to

401
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,960
amazon.com and get it or go to the

402
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,940
library and get it for free I tell

403
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,350
people get it for free doesn't matter to

404
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,740
me I just want everybody to have being

405
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,280
from

406
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,500
and he'll so okay so let's talk about

407
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,000
other things here while another variety

408
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,860
of epstein-barr will go to the thyroid

409
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,570
but it'll also stay in the liver most

410
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,340
all varieties of epstein-barr do you

411
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,290
stay back into the liver a little bit

412
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,060
where they feed off of copper like I

413
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,950
said they feed off of other pollutants

414
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,590
inside the liver the livers a garbage

415
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:32,830
dump and that's why you know I wrote the

416
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:34,420
book liver rescue okay that's why I

417
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,950
wrote the book liver rescue livers a

418
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,170
garbage dump it harbors all these

419
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,880
different toxins so you know and and so

420
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,830
these viruses like the stay back into

421
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,660
the liver in the whole bit and they like

422
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,630
the feed off of copper to create eczema

423
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,300
and psoriasis viruses like the

424
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,130
epstein-barr love to create eye problems

425
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,470
they love to create floaters in the eyes

426
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,270
they even love to create glaucoma that's

427
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,700
one thing that happens

428
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,920
Epstein Marcos the breast tissue creates

429
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,720
breast cancer another variety of

430
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,910
epstein-barr will cause lupus will cause

431
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,210
multiple sclerosis another variety will

432
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,530
cause Lyme disease Lyme disease our

433
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,570
neural basically Lyme disease is

434
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,270
neurological Lyme it's neurological

435
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,700
condition it's basically neurological

436
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,190
fatigue and different tics and spasms

437
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,800
and twitches and weak nervous systems

438
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,780
and like you feel like your legs or

439
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,340
cement bags and it can be listed under

440
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,840
Lyme disease it dr. be like well you

441
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,280
probably got Lyme disease another doctor

442
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,510
might be like whoa you got a little bit

443
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,010
of this you got a little bit of that

444
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,280
everybody gives it different diagnosis

445
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,380
but so let's go into like that as we can

446
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,720
doctors are finally learning now because

447
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,820
of this information that Lyme disease is

448
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,260
viral so we're gonna cover that for a

449
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,850
minute if you got if you guys got a

450
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,130
second I'm gonna drink a little bit of

451
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,550
this because I'm I'm seeking out the

452
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,790
information got a little bit of celery

453
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:54,490
juice I hope you're doing your celery

454
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:57,630
juice I hope you are so important

455
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,280
okay so Lyme disease is no longer

456
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,410
bacterial sure the doctors will still

457
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,880
call it bacterial some of them still

458
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,770
think it's many of them still think it's

459
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,010
still bacterial but it's it was a

460
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:13,120
bacterial theory is what it was so all

461
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,150
that bombardment of antibiotics to women

462
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,780
mostly women and some men

463
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:22,150
over the decades the amount of

464
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,260
antibiotic abuse the negligence

465
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:30,340
over the decades I mean the Lyme trail

466
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,420
is brutal the line past is brutal it's

467
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,730
unbelievable

468
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,710
it's still not much better but because

469
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,020
of the medical medium information

470
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,760
because it went worldwide in all the

471
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,760
books around the globe and people got

472
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,250
wise and they learned that Lyme disease

473
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,100
was viral it's all changing now

474
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,410
that's how cats claw the herb is now

475
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,820
being used in doctors offices across the

476
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,740
globe and around the country

477
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,680
that's from original medical medium

478
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,080
information going back many years and so

479
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,600
there's a reason for that because it was

480
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,160
always viral and I'm gonna tell you

481
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,680
something that's really interesting if

482
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,080
you're like okay there's no way that's

483
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,380
not what it says out there he's wrong oh

484
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,560
yeah they secretly moved Lyme disease

485
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,590
into the autoimmune disease category

486
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,900
okay now in order to move Lyme disease

487
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:23,560
into the autoimmune disease category

488
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,570
it can't be bacterial that's how it

489
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,760
works the medical medium books and

490
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,760
information has pushed the medical

491
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,880
system into the direction of putting it

492
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,730
in to autoimmune they wanted to classify

493
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,920
that now because it protects them is

494
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,080
what it does it also determines that

495
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,210
they don't know the true cause because

496
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,700
autoimmune disease causes are all

497
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,110
unknown by research and science the Lyme

498
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,690
disease was put into the autoimmune

499
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,660
category so that means they just decided

500
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,880
behind everybody's back basically they

501
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,310
just decided that bacteria is not the

502
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,750
cause that causes unknown for Lyme

503
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,280
disease so you got all these doctors and

504
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,140
all these decades of work and they're

505
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,300
all been told as bacteria and you got

506
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,490
the line labs all kind of working with

507
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,080
that and I could say well why does the

508
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,130
line lab come up with this and that the

509
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,680
line labs they work on a basis of

510
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,720
inflated inflammation so they work on

511
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,150
inflammation so when they say a Borrelia

512
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,400
and they say you have art nella and they

513
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:23,020
see it the B Ziya they don't see the

514
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,210
Bartonella they don't see them Ibiza

515
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,820
they don't see the Borrelia they just

516
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,889
see inflammation

517
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,450
system just like an anti-nuclear antigen

518
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,450
antibody test just like c-reactive

519
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,960
protein tests they're all inflammation

520
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:39,809
detecting tests so it's the whole thing

521
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,429
has been a scam and a sham for so long

522
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,200
with Lyme disease and they've been

523
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,149
making billions because of it on

524
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,159
antibiotics cuz that's the whole point

525
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,299
it was to make billions and billions and

526
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,919
billions and billions and hundreds of

527
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,149
billions of dollars off antibiotics for

528
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,559
decades and that's how it works so so

529
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:58,080
Lyme disease was placed into the

530
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,330
autoimmune category which they know they

531
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,340
don't have an answer now that's how it

532
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,899
works but you got all these you got all

533
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,490
these old dogs meaning they've been

534
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:07,500
doing it for so many years of pumping so

535
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,600
many antibiotics and so many people for

536
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,250
decades and they just you know they're

537
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,690
already married to their system that

538
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,789
they've been that they've been involved

539
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,620
with that was created by by the theory

540
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:19,320
to begin with and it's hard to come out

541
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,820
of that but the younger doctors doctors

542
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,940
have want people to heal they're

543
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,710
learning now about this information and

544
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,000
and some of the older doctors too and

545
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,830
have a lot of experience of learning

546
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,500
about it and it pushed it into the

547
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,159
different category so it's so important

548
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,490
to know this

549
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,620
um Borrelia Babesia Bartonella they're

550
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,750
not superbugs they can be killed off by

551
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,399
antibiotics extremely easy

552
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,000
they're not superbugs they're not like

553
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:46,860
MRSA nurses got a much higher rate of

554
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,809
healing through antibiotics is an

555
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,600
incredible mercy so much Merces a

556
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:54,210
superbug literally a superbug

557
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,899
but for some reason mercer can be healed

558
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,000
with antibiotics so why why can why

559
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:03,090
cannot be healed without the antibiotics

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,190
but yet Borrelia Bartonella can because

561
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,929
it can cause it does get killed off

562
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,929
because when you're viral

563
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:12,029
antibiotics do not stop viruses so

564
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,159
that's what happens you got a whole wake

565
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,289
of people suffering from Lyme disease

566
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,120
even today right now and getting Lyme

567
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,830
disease diagnosis and they were

568
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,659
bombarded with antibiotics that's why

569
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,580
Lyme doctors now are doing less and less

570
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,250
antibiotics and smaller amounts and

571
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,860
smaller dosages and milder forms of it

572
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,240
and then they're bringing in supplements

573
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,250
and all kinds of herbs and different

574
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,500
things because they know they're

575
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,960
learning because the antibiotics wreaked

576
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,680
havoc and broke people down made them

577
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,170
sicker for so many

578
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,060
decades I'm not against antibiotics I'm

579
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,620
not against antibiotics in the use

580
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,080
they're needed for for certain things

581
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,660
that's not what this is about but for

582
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,730
Lyme disease this huge mistake was made

583
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,200
see Lyme disease in early 1970s when it

584
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:54,880
was discovered there was a group of very

585
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,490
smart intelligent doctors and for 'allah

586
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,010
gist that believed it was viral but you

587
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,360
can't make money back then in the 70s or

588
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,790
the 80s because there were no

589
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,530
medications for viruses when a doctor

590
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,570
attorney when diagnosis was viral or

591
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:10,270
they believed a diagnosis was viral

592
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,070
there was no answer so no money was made

593
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,600
ever except for the doctor's appointment

594
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,180
itself but there were no drugs being

595
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,490
sold so they classified it as bacteria

596
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,800
so Big Pharma classified it as bacteria

597
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,410
to make sure they can sell tremendous

598
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,500
amounts of antibiotics that's how the

599
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,240
business runs so it was put so all these

600
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,610
doctors were indoctrinated to believe it

601
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,290
was bacterial so they bombarded people

602
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,870
on the MARTA people for decades made a

603
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:37,450
wake of hell and and I mean so many

604
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,340
lives were lost over this and it wasn't

605
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,860
the doctors fault I mean that's not what

606
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,960
it is the system creates this bacteria

607
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,190
cannot cause neurological symptoms I'm

608
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,350
gonna go into that for a little bit

609
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,500
right here thank you for coming on my

610
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,510
new youtube channel little bit covering

611
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,160
serious topics so you can learn and

612
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,840
he'll talk about thyroid healing you

613
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,850
don't have the book at amazon.com and

614
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,320
get it it's you won't make a mistake

615
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,120
getting that book when you read it

616
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,500
you'll be blown away I can't cover even

617
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,980
a fraction of the information in that

618
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,840
book so let's go into the whole bit here

619
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,420
of where we're heading now bacteria

620
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,870
cannot cause neurological symptoms

621
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,910
bacteria does not cause the aches and

622
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,650
pains it does not cause the tangles in

623
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,720
numbness does not cause the ringing in

624
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,100
the ears does not cause all the

625
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,020
different neurological symptoms the eye

626
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,730
floaters two twitches the spasms the

627
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,770
burning pain all over the body the

628
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,190
neuropathy burning pain on a feet

629
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,660
burning pain on the hands all of that

630
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,370
bacteria doesn't cause all of the

631
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,200
neurological impatient conditions

632
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,670
including that neurological fatigue the

633
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,260
eye floaters like I said the vertigo the

634
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,930
dizziness the tinnitus the severe

635
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,510
anxiety bacteria can't cause severe

636
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,490
anxiety so important to know they cannot

637
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,110
create neurotoxins see this is how it

638
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,080
works

639
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,930
bacteria when feeding off of food

640
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,590
can't release a neurotoxin only a virus

641
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,700
can so when bacteria eats the foods that

642
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:58,110
I'm going to show you guys if you guys

643
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,760
just came on and everything and you're

644
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,500
here right now I can't wait to show you

645
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,510
the foods and we're gonna talk about why

646
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,850
foods get us in trouble which foods get

647
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,610
us in trouble you won't believe it you

648
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,910
will be very happy about this episode so

649
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,770
when bacteria feeds off of foods then it

650
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,360
likes it can't release a potent

651
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,880
neurotoxin remember what I was saying

652
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,800
before a neurotoxin creates damage to

653
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,770
the neurological system it creates

654
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,080
damage in a way where it hampers it down

655
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,880
it dampers it down it brings it down and

656
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,710
he'd get fatigued and your legs feel

657
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,840
kind of heavy and you feel fatigued why

658
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,270
am i slept all these hours last night

659
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,100
why am I still tired I slept a zillion

660
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:37,170
hours last night why am I still tired

661
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,580
and that's what happens where you're

662
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,080
like what's going on and then you get

663
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,520
diagnosed a little bit of dream fatigue

664
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,110
then you get told your hormones are off

665
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,300
because the doctors have no idea why you

666
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,650
have T then you think well loss of

667
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,480
libido fatigue and all these other

668
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,520
things it must be my hormones it must be

669
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,870
something else and that's it happens and

670
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,550
if the fatigue sticks around too long

671
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,950
after they've played around with all

672
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,480
your different step stuff after if it

673
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,100
sticks around too long you might get a

674
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,540
final you might finally get a lot of

675
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,160
disease diagnosis you might get some

676
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,150
kind of other diagnosis then all of a

677
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,160
sudden they're looking for other things

678
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,320
so many women around the country mostly

679
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,330
women and then now this fatigue is

680
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,460
neurological fatigue and it's not

681
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,470
bacteria bacteria can't create a

682
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,940
neurotoxin which hampers and weakens the

683
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,010
nervous system you guys should watch

684
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,960
this whole thing all over again I'm not

685
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,670
even halfway done here but you gotta

686
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,760
watch this whole episode all over again

687
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,310
the information is really intense and

688
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,960
and I understand that so the body aches

689
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,670
and pains nerve pain all through the

690
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,100
body the fibromyalgia the tics the

691
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:35,100
spasms twitches these are all viral

692
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,440
symptoms you guys and people suffer with

693
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,270
it and it breaks my heart to know people

694
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,830
suffer that bad they don't have answers

695
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,210
they've been to ten neurologists so even

696
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,070
if you go to one neurology so you go to

697
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,630
your internist you go to your GP you go

698
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,760
to one a neurologist it's just too much

699
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,350
you know making appointments making

700
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,790
having your life all I've seen with

701
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,750
younger people to twenty years old and

702
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,400
nineteen years old and their life is

703
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,040
already about doctor's appointments I

704
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,420
mean what kind of world are we in right

705
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,410
now where science of research just

706
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:02,100
doesn't have the back

707
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:04,670
of people for with chronic illness when

708
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,740
there are answers it's amazing really so

709
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,780
look fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis

710
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,190
lupus PCOS reproductive problems and

711
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,620
then we Teresa's all these things all

712
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,420
these things that people go through the

713
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,340
hot flashes the heart palpitations so

714
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,860
many different systems it's symptoms

715
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:23,640
it's based on viruses it's based on

716
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,080
viruses releasing poisons and causing

717
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,760
problems this is why so many people's

718
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,790
Lyme disease get them to get the thyroid

719
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:32,190
test I mean their thyroid problem okay

720
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:34,320
they're one of the reasons why they were

721
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:36,300
put they pushed Lyme disease into the

722
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,850
autumn the autoimmune category is

723
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,830
because it was getting kind of

724
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,300
suspicious too with the medical medium

725
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,980
information going out there teaching

726
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,510
people about the thyroid problem being

727
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,830
viral and the thyroid problem being

728
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,200
epstein-barr because that information

729
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,140
came from the medical medium information

730
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,000
stats came from this source only that

731
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,070
your thyroid problem and your

732
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,230
Hashimoto's thyroiditis is caused by

733
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:59,910
epstein-barr and now you'll see data out

734
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,110
there because what they do is you know

735
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:02,730
they don't want the medical medium

736
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,740
getting all the credit all the time so

737
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,420
then they try to put they try to put

738
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,070
articles out there as if it came from

739
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,470
somewhere else but this this was way

740
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,090
before all of that I mean it's that well

741
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,280
document to be way before all of that

742
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:17,040
and what happens is the the epstein-barr

743
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,510
virus that causes thyroid problems for

744
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,950
the when they noticed everybody with

745
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:22,410
Lyme disease was getting thyroid

746
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,210
problems so that was another thing so

747
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,120
doctors are like scratching your head

748
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,830
they're like well you know what I mean

749
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,030
it's everybody has the thyroid problems

750
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,100
everybody has these other issues

751
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,350
everybody all the Lyme people have

752
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,720
fibromyalgia so just starting to belief

753
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,610
wait a minute we're off here because

754
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,070
bacteria doesn't cause any of that so

755
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,670
it's viral so it's so important to know

756
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,860
these things

757
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,470
that's why a majority of people have not

758
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:49,320
gotten better that's why a majority of

759
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,300
people have not gotten better on

760
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,550
antibiotics what I mean in majority I

761
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,100
mean the majority and antibiotic

762
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,920
treatments for Lyme disease that's why

763
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,140
they haven't gotten better because it's

764
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,700
viral so I'm just trying to spell it out

765
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,460
for you see you have you're empowered

766
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,990
you have the information you have the

767
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,910
strength all of it

768
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,440
and so many have suffered terribly I

769
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,770
mean it's it's devastating they lost

770
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,780
their lives they lost

771
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,130
likelihoods careers all these different

772
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,510
things people suffer with and they're

773
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:18,010
going through that now even when they

774
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,540
don't get a Lyme disease diagnosis and

775
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,860
you just got fatigued and you're broken

776
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,920
down I've seen people lose their

777
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,050
relationships I've seen I've seen so

778
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,690
many women lose their relationships you

779
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,700
know their fiance's and their you know

780
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,740
their husbands and so much going on

781
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,540
because cousins like well scratching

782
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,970
their head wall wait a minute how did I

783
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,830
did I buy into this this what is this

784
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,370
hush modus thyroiditis cuz you know how

785
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,200
guys are

786
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,470

function

792
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,290
I've seen people literally in tears you

793
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,550
know over the years crying to doctors

794
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,920
that are friends of mine the doctors

795
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,690
telling me about these stories and and

796
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,520
I've heard it myself too over the years

797
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:08,470
it's just unbelievable how it how it

798
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:13,420
works so so uh so uh the bottom line is

799
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,100
is Lyme disease is not what people think

800
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,880

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,280
category here let's go let's talk

802
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,300
everybody has at least one EBV who's

803
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,480
sick

804
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:28,420
anybody who's sick doesn't just have one

805
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,790
variety it's easy to get two varieties

806
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,110
it's easy to get more it all depends on

807
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:34,210

talk about the foods that get us in

814
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,090
trouble what that means how that gets us

815
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,950
in trouble what happens and I'm talking

816
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,350
about the epstein-barr epstein-barr

817
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,180
virus talking about this thyroid healing

818
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,360
book the whole bit so we're going into

819
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,970
it almost every person on the planet has

820
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,000
one variety of epstein-barr one variety

821
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,890
of epstein-barr it lives in the organs

822
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,140
it lives in the liver in the organs

823
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,030
going undetected by tests and

824
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,620
undiagnosed from doctors for years this

825
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,120
information I'm sharing with you is

826
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,620
still unknown to medical research and

827
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,070
science doctors do not know where to

828
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,460
look

829
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,250
for epstein-barr it's hard tests cannot

830
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,710
detect EBV in the liver or organs

831
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,870
there's no test

832
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,330
can detect epstein-barr in your liver or

833
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:30,570
organs that's how it works and they do

834
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:32,580
have tests for at EBV but not in the

835
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,390
liver and organs see doctors are looking

836
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,679
for symptoms and linking it to EBV now

837
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,539
because of the medical medium

838
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,520
information they're looking for symptoms

839
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:43,200
okay here's how it worked in the old

840
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,850
biggest Epstein Barr because some of you

841
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,100
might say well you didn't come up with

842
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,279
the ethene bar diagnosis or to figure

843
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,590
out like the Epstein bar no I didn't

844
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:56,070
Anthony Epstein you know that doctor

845
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,429
okay that genius found that virus okay

846
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,960
he did but see that viruses only

847
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:03,120
contributed to one thing back in the day

848
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,580
called yuppies disease that's that's

849
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,309
what it was contributed to malaise a

850
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,289
little bit of fatigue a little bit of

851
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,700
listlessness for a little bit in your

852
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:14,490
life and that's it

853
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,580
but it's that that's not what it causes

854
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:21,539
it causes that times a hundred in

855
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,700
everybody that's how it works so here's

856
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:25,049
here's the thing doctors I've worked

857
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,740
with over the decades

858
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:31,529
I help them troubleshoot their cases so

859
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,570
I spent years and years and years

860
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:35,520
helping out doctors with their

861
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,500
troubleshooting cases doctors have

862
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,450
compassion and they want information no

863
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,799
matter what because when they realized

864
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,090
after they come out of medical school

865
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,679
when I talk to doctors all the time

866
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,330
about this and the information isn't

867
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,950
there what they need why people are

868
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:49,110
filing in with all these symptoms and

869
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,240
conditions they want more and want more

870
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,820
and a lot more because they got into the

871
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,669
medical industry to get people better so

872
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,370
fatigue and listlessness and malaise of

873
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:01,980
the old days of Epstein Barr then that's

874
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,779
not how it works Epstein Barr causes so

875
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,460
much more look expand it be up see more

876
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:07,169

healing medical medium series now

881
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:20,970
doctors around the world are using this

882
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:22,770
book so right here this book is in their

883
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,480
practice around the world and when

884
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,490
people find a doctor that's using that

885
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,649
book it's like a reprieve

886
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,419
it's like what so my body is not

887
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,670
destroying itself so if body's not

888
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,950
destroying the thyroid

889
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,030
actually can heal this is a virus and we

890
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,880
could work on trying to get some

891
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:40,280
antiviral protocols going and and

892
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,140
something changes in the person they

893
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,260
know they can heal so important to know

894
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,260
so look let's let's talk about some

895
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,240
other things why are there so many

896
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,010
epstein-barr mutations how did this

897
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,830
happen and how did these varieties of

898
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,780
epstein-barr get into our bodies so so

899
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,900
many people everybody has one variety

900
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:03,610
okay around the world basically but many

901
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,830
of us have two varieties three varieties

902
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:08,360
epstein-barr was raised in labs long ago

903
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,890
I'm gonna go into a big food thing

904
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,450
pretty soon I got a whole bunch of foods

905
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:12,680
here I'm gonna talk about what foods get

906
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,140
us in trouble so you've got to stay on

907
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,120
for that here's an egg that's a theme it

908
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,040
gets us in trouble you see you saw some

909
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,750
of you saw the why eggs make us sick if

910
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,030
you haven't go back to that one after

911
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,340
this one watch that YouTube learn learn

912
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,410
how to heal so epstein-barr was raised

913
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:30,050
in labs on chicken eggs that was one of

914
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,030
the fuel sources so chicken eggs the

915
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,320
hormones inside chicken eggs the natural

916
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,750
occurring ones not talking about the

917
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,300
agate ones that the industries do now

918
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,340
you know free-range organic whatever the

919
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,690
natural occurring hormone okay and the

920
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,630
natural current proteins

921
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:47,420
fed viruses raised in the labs that's

922
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:50,420
what they did okay somehow these viruses

923
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,340
escaped erasing labs and they escaped to

924
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,890
the public so you know we could use your

925
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,390
imagination on that many of you like to

926
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,960
think where could how could that have

927
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,450
happened

928
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,450
but they did and it happened the

929
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:05,300
original epstein-barr existed before

930
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,280
this the old epstein-barr before the 16

931
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,950
mutations the original epstein-barr

932
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,140
existed well before this and that was so

933
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,300
much it was so less aggressive it wasn't

934
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,890
problematic you guys but since that new

935
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,070
newer varieties that are severe and

936
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:21,970
potent very strong powerful and

937
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:25,190
neurotoxic have submerge or emerged

938
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,450
these strains have mutated over the

939
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,130
decades and now we're dealing with the

940
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,110
over 60 varieties I just want to cover

941
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,940
that really little deeper and they're

942
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,130
going to continue to me you take and

943
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,230
grow as the years move on why do you

944
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,530
think we have so much chronic illness

945
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,270
around the war

946
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,990
literally out of pace no one's ever seen

947
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,879
before

948
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:45,220
when I talk to doctors did like they're

949
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,109
like even with all of the health minded

950
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,060
information and no gluten and then this

951
00:34:47,109 --> 00:34:50,830
and the bad and all the supplements out

952
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:53,379
there and those stores shelves pack of

953
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:57,580
supplements it's rising like never

954
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:59,589
before and so because the viruses are

955
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,420
tough they're tough to deal with and

956
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:02,580
they're passing from person to person so

957
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,380
let's talk about how that stuff

958
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,480
relationships body fluids that's how you

959
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,580
be these passed around a lot that's a

960
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,260
big one so I'm just saying so you know

961
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,670
you wanna you want to be careful along

962
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,800
the way is you're meeting people and

963
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:17,050
everything else because body bodily

964
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,060
fluids that can happen and and okay if

965
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,410
it happens and it happens and you get a

966
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,820
beat in the epstein-barr and they're

967
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:23,349
sick two years later or three years

968
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,790
later you work on healing it and you

969
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:26,230
work on healing it you get getting rid

970
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,210
of it and moving forward with your life

971
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,339
bottom line restaurants is a big place

972
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,650
to restaurants now I'm not trying to rip

973
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:35,650
down restaurants you know the industry's

974
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,970
a you know it's a it's industry you know

975
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,700
the sort of food and make people happy

976
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,500
so and a lot of people have the heart

977
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,349
soul in the restaurants but restaurants

978
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,030
are also place its Forks utensils that

979
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:47,260
aren't washed or sterilized properly

980
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,970
it's shrinking glasses that aren't

981
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,760
washed or sterilized properly if you got

982
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,950
lipstick on a glass it wasn't wiped off

983
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,349
completely and that and it's still there

984
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,030
it can contain and hold the epstein-barr

985
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:59,680
virus within the lipstick so if you've

986
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,480
got a coffee cup and you got old some

987
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,940
old lipstick on it that didn't kind of

988
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,400
scrub off you know in that diner or

989
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,260
somewhere or that place that holding

990
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,380
contains an Epstein bar virus very

991
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,940
easily this is how across I'm not trying

992
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,170
to make you phobic about it I'm not

993
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,390
trying to make you feel like you can't

994
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:19,030
ever eat out it's not it I'm just

995
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,250
letting you know it's easy to get the up

996
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,160
steam barbwire sharing plates of foods

997
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,540
to you know sharing plates of food

998
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,310
drinking down to somebody's clacks and

999
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,190
everything you know it's with a friend

1000
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:32,020
and I was out in a restaurant and I

1001
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:35,680
didn't finish I didn't finish my the

1002
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,300
food I had in my plate and and and and

1003
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,530
you know that with a few friends when

1004
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,730
the friends grabbed my plate you know

1005
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,140
we're really hungry and I go what are

1006
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,540
you doing then they're just finishing it

1007
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,190
off and what are you doing and they go

1008
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,289
well with you I'm not worrying about it

1009
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:51,039
maybe with you I'm not worried about it

1010
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:53,109
but it's easy to actually get something

1011
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,539
passed you know from one person to

1012
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:57,339
another because that's how it's done

1013
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:59,440
bodily fluids that's how the bug gets

1014
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:01,450
around public bathrooms that's another

1015
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,220
way this is important information it all

1016
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,039
sounds innocent but the door handles on

1017
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,829
public bathrooms you know I mean put

1018
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:10,480
paper on the seat whatever you do I use

1019
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:12,579
you should ship with paper on the seat

1020
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,289
you know that's one thing here's a tip

1021
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:16,660
in the public bathrooms to try not to

1022
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:18,730
get things as you you know always have

1023
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:20,109
some handy wipes in public bathrooms you

1024
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,059
know washing your hands at the sink

1025
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:23,680
everybody else does just kind of like

1026
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,730
everybody else just went to the bathroom

1027
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,799
now they're at the same touching

1028
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,270
everything well you know what I like to

1029
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:29,970
do is keep some handy wipes on me I

1030
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,530
think that's actually a better option

1031
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,119
but the other thing too with the public

1032
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,700
bathroom thing that's one way that's

1033
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,130
really popular with with transmitting

1034
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:41,589
with actually getting the epstein-barr

1035
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,450
virus is you want you in a public

1036
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:45,430
bathroom flush the toilet before you

1037
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,020
even start going to bathroom even if it

1038
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,119
looks like it was flushed before

1039
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,859
just give it a flush so whatever could

1040
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,109
gremlin says could go in there and hold

1041
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:54,789
it and throw some paper on the seat yeah

1042
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:57,160
it sounds silly to a lot of you a lot of

1043
00:37:54,789 --> 00:38:00,309
you don't care like I get it and I have

1044
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,670
respect for you 100% but that's what I

1045
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:02,829
do

1046
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,359
ok that's what the medical medium does

1047
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:07,480
and he does it for a reason a good

1048
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:09,460
reason so let's go into the four stages

1049
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,650
of epstein-barr and we're almost to the

1050
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,480
food part two no it's gonna be fun let's

1051
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,430
go to four stages epstein-barr I've seen

1052
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,010
bars four stages researches Sciences

1053
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,869
unaware of it completely doctors are

1054
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,490
aware of it now because of the medical

1055
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,200
medium information you know if I were

1056
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,359
healing book make sure you get it go to

1057
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,220
amazon.com make sure you have that book

1058
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:31,210
I can't I can't cover a fraction of that

1059
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:33,010
book it's not even possible so stage one

1060
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,650
the early stage you get up scene bar and

1061
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,420
it incubates it sits in you that's one

1062
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,579
of the stages you can get it passed down

1063
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,049
from parents you can get your Epstein

1064
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,450
bar passed down from parents you can get

1065
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:46,539
it from other family members too you can

1066
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,400
get it from other family members and so

1067
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,839
it's important to know that meaning just

1068
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,119
living in the house so you've got

1069
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,020
brothers and sisters and you know and

1070
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:55,490
they get it somewhere out there and

1071
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,290
they bring it back and everybody's

1072
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,840
sharing food and sharing this and

1073
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,820
sharing that and absolutely so it's easy

1074
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,060
to it's so easy to get different

1075
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:07,400
projects but the early stage it can but

1076
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,140
what happens is it sits in the bodies

1077
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,760
person isn't it sits in the bloodstream

1078
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,250
sorry about that sits in the bloodstream

1079
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,260
and it lays dormant so that's what it

1080
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,580
does that's the first stage you get you

1081
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,960
pick it up somewhere you get it in

1082
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,630
bodily fluids you get it at a restaurant

1083
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,160
and get in a relationship and now it's

1084
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,690
sitting in there incubating that's what

1085
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,340
it does but things going to happen in

1086
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,230
life you can be under a lot of stress

1087
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,840
you can go through a lot you can you can

1088
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,120
be you can go through something in your

1089
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,790
life it's very difficult that causes

1090
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,290
your immune system to weaken so it could

1091
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,730
be a loss it could be a betrayal it

1092
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,080
could be trust breakage it could be

1093
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,520
somebody stabbing you in the back it

1094
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,620
could be a relationship that went wrong

1095
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,990
it could be somebody broke up with you

1096
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,940
it could be maybe you're just a

1097
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,860
miserable person because you're just to

1098
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,050
your beer you just you're just been

1099
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,360
through so much so much whatever it is

1100
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,670
that's going on and and you've had a

1101
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,740
hard time and you've had a hard life or

1102
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,530
whatever the hardship is even if it's

1103
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:03,110
not that hard to one person but it's if

1104
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:06,710
it could be hard to you it could be a

1105
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:07,820
big deal to you and you know people go

1106
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,250
through so many different things and

1107
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,960
they take things to heart and personal

1108
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,510
ways that another person might not have

1109
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,190
and that's everybody's right to feel and

1110
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,040
have their emotions and all that but

1111
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,170
heartbreak and betrayal all of that is

1112
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,660
painful can weaken the immune system so

1113
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:25,310
if you have that incubating epstein-barr

1114
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:26,810
that you caught somewhere and it's just

1115
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,090
been sitting in your system for a year

1116
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:30,830
or two years three years five months a

1117
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,480
month and then you go through some

1118
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:34,190
adrenal stress you go through some

1119
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,870
fight-or-flight you get some heartbreak

1120
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,210
you get some betrayal your immune system

1121
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:42,710
drops down a little bit it looks for

1122
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:44,270
this and then there's the poor diet the

1123
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,920
poor night we're going into that right

1124
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:49,310
now let's talk about foods and the whole

1125
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,000
bit a little bit why someone can eat

1126
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:56,410
gluten or dairy or corn and not have a

1127
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,990
problem and be fine when someone else

1128
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,880
can eat that and get really sick or it

1129
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,010
makes them sicker over time whether they

1130
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,540
know it or not what

1131
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:08,500
symptoms and conditions so let's go into

1132
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:10,240
foods and food talk hope everybody is

1133
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,840
doing good I got my celery juice right

1134
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,610
here heading into a new part of this the

1135
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,650
next part of this I see a lot of

1136
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,590
comments and I really appreciate that

1137
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:24,160
because all that's good so start with

1138
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:27,520
right here so I got some milk right here

1139
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,200
all right now they're all good companies

1140
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,460
every every company I'm showing right

1141
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,750
here it's all good companies but it's

1142
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,780
not about that so I'm just covering

1143
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:38,020
labels and you know I'm not ripping down

1144
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,790
any brands or anything of course I'm

1145
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,440
supportive of everybody trying to

1146
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,750
survive out there in the world but milk

1147
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,700
milk is actually a problem just so you

1148
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:49,390
know so I'm gonna let you know milk

1149
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,890
feeds the epstein-barr virus it does and

1150
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,140
what happens is people think lactose

1151
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:55,000
intolerance they think wait a minute you

1152
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,590
know lactose intolerance is my problem

1153
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,690
that's why I can't drink milk that's why

1154
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,700
I have to stay away from milk but that's

1155
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,560
fear so lactose intolerance is it

1156
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,360
actually is an actual theory just so you

1157
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,210
know what's really happening is the

1158
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,960
epstein-barr virus feeds off of lactose

1159
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:13,660
it feeds off of proteins in milk it

1160
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,370
feeds off of sugars and no so it's

1161
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,830
really important to know there's also

1162
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:19,840
natural occurring hormones in organic

1163
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,900
milk and really good milk high-quality

1164
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,120
pasture-raised and so forth and if

1165
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,040
somebody's heart is in creating the best

1166
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,470
milk out there or the best product that

1167
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,180
I'm gonna show I support them in that

1168
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,220
sense because their hearts in it they're

1169
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,810
creating good stuff but I'm talking

1170
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,490
about sickness and the epstein-barr

1171
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,500
virus I'm talking about happens when you

1172
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:39,940
have the virus in you it's incubating

1173
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,150
it's sitting in you and what happens

1174
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:45,400
okay so when you're drinking milk see

1175
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,020
none of the other diet systems that say

1176
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,150
stay away from milk if there's one that

1177
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,430
says stay away from milk knows why

1178
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,590
people get sick and they're just playing

1179
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:56,260
guessing games that's not what this is

1180
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,210
I'm gonna teach you how you get sick

1181
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,650
when you're drinking these things or

1182
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,970
when you're eating certain foods so

1183
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,250
you're really empowered so you have the

1184
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,620
original information a source that

1185
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,380
started basically this kind of stuff

1186
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:10,890
going back 35 plus years ago so it's so

1187
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,720
important no bugs love to feed off of

1188
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:16,599
lactose protein and next

1189
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,170
hormones occurring hormones in milk so

1190
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:21,640
and milk will you'll see you'll hear out

1191
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,080
there all with mucus forming you'll hear

1192
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,340
from the different diet belief systems

1193
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,710
out there well I'll commute this forming

1194
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,570
stay away why is it mucus forming nobody

1195
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,010
knows why it's mucus forming they just

1196
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:31,359
say stay away from Dairy it's mucus

1197
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:32,470
forming you'll hear that all the time

1198
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,720
and all the different diet belief

1199
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:38,170
systems and all that but what they don't

1200
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:41,170
know is it's mucus forming because it's

1201
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,930
feeding viruses and pathogens of all

1202
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,890
kinds that's what happens with this kind

1203
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:46,990
of thing when you're doing their

1204
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,119
products you're feeding something when

1205
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:51,490
you feed something it creates mucus this

1206
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,859
is why so many people can drink milk and

1207
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,859
eat cheese and eat other things and not

1208
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:59,200
have mucus it's also why people can also

1209
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:00,849
eat gluten they can take a nude stereo

1210
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,849
they can do whatever they want and they

1211
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:05,980
don't get sick and they seem okay

1212
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:08,380
someone else drinks some dairy they're

1213
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:11,320
in the bathroom because above fed off of

1214
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,760
the lactose released it created

1215
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,619
inflammation and now you're sitting in

1216
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,619
the bathroom with IBS because of a

1217
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:19,390
pathogen not because of a food because

1218
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,390
of a pathogen this is why somebody else

1219
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,859
can eat the food and not have that see

1220
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:26,320
how important it is to know these things

1221
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:28,359
the power of that can do me for you in a

1222
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,950
lot of different ways it's not that you

1223
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:32,290
have a faulty body it's not that you

1224
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,150
have an enzyme theory there's a theory

1225
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:36,160
that an enzyme you don't have to in

1226
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,349
order to actually have dairy products

1227
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,880
that's a theory because they don't know

1228
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:41,230
what causes illness still science

1229
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,030
research has no idea and science

1230
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,770
research knows nothing about food they

1231
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,390
don't know nothing about food when you

1232
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,680
drink it or consuming or eat it and it

1233
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:50,859
enters in the stomach you think there's

1234
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,839
an actual test or a machine that can

1235
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:54,609
determine when you eat something what's

1236
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,140
happening is scrambling through the body

1237
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,880
and the body is breaking it apart or

1238
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,950
what's going on they don't have anything

1239
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,630
in science at all there's nothing they

1240
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:05,589
have they just have theory and guesses

1241
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,480
and so it's so important to know this so

1242
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:09,010
when it comes down to it that's the no

1243
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,050
when it comes down to and then we got

1244
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,930
some cheese right here okay

1245
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:16,030
same thing with cheese now remember

1246
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,130
there's also fat in milk and there's

1247
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:21,550
also fat and cheese there's fat in dairy

1248
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,360
what the fat does is if it strengthens

1249
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,430
the virus more so it strengthens

1250
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,290
hodgins more strengthens epstein-barr

1251
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,480
more so when you're eating the cheese

1252
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,700
you're putting all that fat inside of

1253
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,680
you when you're when your blood gets

1254
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,510
filled with too much fat inside and I've

1255
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,960
been saying this for decades and decades

1256
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:41,120
when it's when it's when when your blood

1257
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,520
gets so filled with fat your oxygen

1258
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,070
levels drop what do you need to stop

1259
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,760
epstein-barr not just your immune system

1260
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:51,380
but you need oxygen in your bloodstream

1261
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,320
the higher fat content in your

1262
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,780
bloodstream pushes out and basically

1263
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,480
hampers down oxygen levels inside the

1264
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:02,930
bloodstream so those oxygen levels are

1265
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,560
how we fight and battle epstein-barr is

1266
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:09,260
how it works so you know the bottom line

1267
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,420
is when you have epstein-barr incubating

1268
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,910
in you getting ready to fire up and

1269
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:15,860
start and you're you're eliminating your

1270
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:17,900
oxygen levels because you're bombarding

1271
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,460
your liver with all this fat intake you

1272
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,810
got the dairy products even if it's good

1273
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,150
dairy even if you're having it once a

1274
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:24,800
week it's still like it still can get

1275
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,240
you in trouble you'd if you're drinking

1276
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,220
milk and just your coffee or whatever

1277
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,020
you're doing you know it still can get

1278
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,550
you in trouble but these are the things

1279
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,350
these high-fat dairy products or even

1280
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,880
low fat dairy products still can feed

1281
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:37,760
the epstein-barr from what they have in

1282
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,320
it so here's an example right here some

1283
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,120
feta cheese that's another cheese -

1284
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,800
because some people say why you'd feta

1285
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,990
cheese that's much better it's it's

1286
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,150
lighter I can have it on my salad I can

1287
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:49,310
have it still feed epstein-barr virus

1288
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,290
and it'll still go off after the

1289
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:53,120
hormones and the best energy is possible

1290
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:56,720
and the best cheddar cheese and the best

1291
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:00,560
Swiss cheese and so forth so you have to

1292
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,840
know that this is why we get sick from

1293
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,160
foods this is why we don't do good with

1294
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,080
food so you be somebody that does great

1295
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,520
with these foods for a little while and

1296
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,350
all of a sudden start getting act and

1297
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,880
you're like what's going on and you

1298
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,790
start getting acne you start getting

1299
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,350
something else they'll feed any pathogen

1300
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,570
like a please caused by streptococcus

1301
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,240
it's caused by that bacteria but this

1302
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:22,100
will feed any pathogen everybody so you

1303
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,970
need to know that and that's how it

1304
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:27,740
works so I'm going to show you some more

1305
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,350
foods too in a second so I just want to

1306
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,600
cover that a little bit so when you're

1307
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:33,910
eating cheese you're actually there's

1308
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,559
hormones in that cheese

1309
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,510
naturally occurring even if it's

1310
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:38,890
free-range organic sino so many of

1311
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:40,390
you're like well what if it's work in it

1312
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,609
what if it's pasture-raised what if it's

1313
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,039
that I'm letting you know the natural

1314
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:48,970
occurring hormones and the proteins okay

1315
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:51,490
and let the sugar lactose is going to

1316
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,710
feed any pathogen possible so whatever

1317
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,270
you got incubating in you if you have

1318
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,609
strep sitting in you from when you had

1319
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:00,190
strep throat as a child if you have an

1320
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:01,809
Epstein bar incubating or an Epstein bar

1321
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,400
that's not incubating that thing's been

1322
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:05,200
causing you pain and suffering or

1323
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,660
symptoms and conditions or anxiety and

1324
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:11,380
and fibromyalgia aches and pains and

1325
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:13,599
fatigue and and and foggy head and brain

1326
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,390
fog and all that if you have all that

1327
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,369
going on absolutely you got to get rid

1328
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:19,780
of these foods this is why foods will

1329
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:21,280
get you in trouble but you're not gonna

1330
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,799
hear anywhere else or from any other

1331
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,150
source of why they get you in trouble

1332
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:26,770
besides the theories maybe you're

1333
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,039
lactose intolerant well that's a great

1334
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:31,119
guessing game okay you know I mean there

1335
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:32,890
may have in a way that they don't even

1336
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,260
have a way to tell it's impossible

1337
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,569
literally and so that's how we're so we

1338
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:39,880
walk around without knowing that we

1339
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:41,710
actually are viral and we actually are

1340
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,029
getting sicker as the years come on and

1341
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,799
look if you're indestructible and you're

1342
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:46,059
in that age right now each bracket and

1343
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:48,250
you feel like yet nothing's really

1344
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:50,380
happening to unique and that you can

1345
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,730
just get in a gym and exercise and this

1346
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,859
stuff's crazy I'm staying away from

1347
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:56,559
gluten I'm staying with this anyway I'm

1348
00:48:53,859 --> 00:48:58,510
all fine but if you think but you're not

1349
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,720
if you're untouchable you're wrong

1350
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,970
because every single person is getting a

1351
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,549
symptom no matter what along the way at

1352
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,740
some time in their life or symptoms or

1353
00:49:06,549 --> 00:49:10,869
sickness or disease it's just the way

1354
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,880
it's heading there's no way around it

1355
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:15,160
unless you know what to do power

1356
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,630
yourself heal the whole day get this

1357
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,400
from the library for free go to

1358
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:21,849
amazon.com and get a copy it's not

1359
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,450
expensive um so so important so here's

1360
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:24,339
how it works

1361
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,809
bugs feed off of these things and you

1362
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,520
know here's a book here's butter right

1363
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,609
here okay so I've got some butter high

1364
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,049
quality butter alright so I'm not

1365
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:36,930
shaming the companies that make this

1366
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:39,720
food but all dairy these bugs and paths

1367
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,850
yes and dairy puts that high fat and

1368
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,750
burns liver and beats it down so path

1369
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,300
that's a passion

1370
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,890
pathogens can thrive like epstein-barr

1371
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,660
inside the liver and if you have more

1372
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,010
than one epstein-barr virus if you have

1373
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,420
more than one variety to sitting inside

1374
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:53,910
the liver that's sitting there eating

1375
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,310
and thriving all of those dairy products

1376
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,140
over time you're gonna get the hot

1377
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,670
flashes or heart palpitations you're

1378
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:01,380
gonna get the sluggish liver you're

1379
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,610
gonna get the waking down the road down

1380
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,190
to yours you can get all these different

1381
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:07,050
things the liver can't help us when it's

1382
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,820
over burdened with too much fat and it's

1383
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,200
loaded up with poisons because the liver

1384
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,750
is the garbage dump

1385
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,610
and so when you're got pathogens when

1386
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,930
you got sickness when you have all these

1387
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,490
different symptoms you've got a couple

1388
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,770
of different viruses inside the liver

1389
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:21,270
creating your fibromyalgia lupus your

1390
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,460
your eczema or psoriasis all these

1391
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,920
different conditions your anxiety your

1392
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:28,920
thyroid disorders all of it then you

1393
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,130
can't detox you can't cleanse and you

1394
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,440
can't detox now it's so important to

1395
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,360
know you listen it's like the lemon

1396
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:39,390
water thing right you've heard a lemon

1397
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:41,880
water by now okay see you know medical

1398
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:43,770
medium information did not create a

1399
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,620
lemon water people have been putting

1400
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,700
lemon in their water for centuries

1401
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,770
they've been putting lemon in their

1402
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,690
water for centuries that said they're

1403
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,850
putting lemon in their tea but the

1404
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,490
information that I did bring to

1405
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:59,010
everybody through my source okay was

1406
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:02,520
that when you use lemon water in the

1407
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:04,140
morning if flushes the liver that comes

1408
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,090
from medical medium information that's

1409
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,700
the original source and it's been out

1410
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:10,650
there for years now and so there's a

1411
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,930
reason why you want to flush your liver

1412
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,360
with lemon you want to squeeze lemon in

1413
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:15,780
water and drink it there's a reason for

1414
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,810
that

1415
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,760
because it flushes the liver it flushes

1416
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:22,050
out the poisons in the morning and

1417
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,670
that's the original medical medium

1418
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:25,410
information so if you ever heard that

1419
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,630
and everybody's been squeezing lemon to

1420
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:29,220
flush out their liver or flush out their

1421
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,200
toxins that comes from medical medium

1422
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,610
information and I noticed it's gone

1423
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,970
around the world doctors tell me all the

1424
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,800
time

1425
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,600
thank God you told me that 15-20 years

1426
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,550
ago thank God you put it in all your

1427
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,350
books because it's really helping a lot

1428
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:41,730
of my patients I hear that all the time

1429
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,260
and if somebody might say well hey you

1430
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,240
didn't start lemon water no of course

1431
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,770
not people are put in lemon lemon in

1432
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,960
water

1433
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:51,080
or lemon in their teeth long before I

1434
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,460
existed and long before you existed but

1435
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,200
that wasn't to flush out the liver

1436
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,670
nobody knew about that parts and now

1437
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,290
people are doing their large lemon

1438
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,120
waters in the morning I'm so glad you

1439
00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:00,680
guys are doing it too because if you're

1440
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,290
on the high-fat diets and you're putting

1441
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,850
like this should not be consumed in your

1442
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,770
diet if you got symptoms conditions

1443
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,230
issues happening if you got acne

1444
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:11,210
whatever it is bugs will feed on but

1445
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,190
natural occurring hormones in here bugs

1446
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:15,230
will feed on the sugars in here bugs

1447
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:17,120
bugs will actually grow because of the

1448
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,100
amount of fat in here that's naturally

1449
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,300
occurring so it's really important to

1450
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,700
know these things so that's the butter

1451
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,470
butter we'll get in trouble butter

1452
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,390
doesn't make you strong butter doesn't

1453
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,000
make you indestructible butter just

1454
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,920
feeds viruses along the way so you get

1455
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,680
your Lyme disease diagnosis winter 52

1456
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,530
years old or you get your Hashimoto's

1457
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,330
thyroid affect you know thyroiditis

1458
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:40,220
diagnosis when you're 32 or you get some

1459
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:41,420
symptoms or you get more acting along

1460
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,770
the way and you're going to doctor the

1461
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,940
doctor and you still don't know why and

1462
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,440
you get off of lutein and you get off a

1463
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,760
couple of foods and your acne starts

1464
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,260
getting a little bit better but then it

1465
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,690
comes back again and then they say well

1466
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:52,160
it's your hormones and so it's so

1467
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:53,810
important to know what foods to stay

1468
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,440
away from let's cover more foods this is

1469
00:52:53,810 --> 00:53:00,830
fun so we've got some kefir right here

1470
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,630
so it's keeper all right now people say

1471
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:04,280
what about kefir Kieffer's good for me

1472
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:06,530
Kieffer's got the probiotics in it the

1473
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,850
whole bit kefir what the kefir is going

1474
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:10,190
to do it's going to do a lot more harm

1475
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:12,590
for you then it's going to do good for

1476
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,480
you critical to understand okay because

1477
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,300
it's still gonna feed any virus or

1478
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,840
pathogen in your body and yes it's

1479
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,330
better than milk in a way but it's still

1480
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,400
going to get you sit down the road

1481
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:27,230
that's how it works so there's the kefir

1482
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,730
that's something to know so I showed you

1483
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:30,230
the milk I've got some more foods on the

1484
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:34,370
way to that I'm gonna show you that are

1485
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:36,650
really important so sour cream - another

1486
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:39,020
one - so many people do sour cream

1487
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:42,380
that's one right there you know there's

1488
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:44,330
a sour cream people say well that's

1489
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,740
different you know you can do that it's

1490
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:48,380
a different kind of Derrick and do a

1491
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,050
little lump of sour cream and and that's

1492
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,910
you know but

1493
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,560
gets you in trouble too it feeds it

1494
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:54,090
feeds all the bugs and everything like

1495
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:59,310
that so let's talk about some other

1496
00:53:54,090 --> 00:54:01,100
stuff so let's talk about this smells

1497
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:03,810
good though

1498
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:06,360
you know it's a bad guy right who

1499
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:09,510
doesn't like a bad guy it's pretty fresh

1500
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:12,120
too so alright so the whole thing with

1501
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:15,330
wheat gluten so everybody knows hey you

1502
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:16,980
know we wheat gluten celiac problems

1503
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,130
people have people have allergies to

1504
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:25,230
gluten the protein so we know all about

1505
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:27,660
that but what no one knows is that why

1506
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,910
does everybody suffer when they have

1507
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:32,340
gluten not everybody but a lot of people

1508
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,960
do whether they know it or not and when

1509
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,430
they remove it they realize it was the

1510
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,920
gluten that's what I mean because a lot

1511
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:41,010
of people don't know it how come because

1512
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,320
gluten feeds pathogens see that

1513
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:46,230
information wasn't out there until the

1514
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,350
medical meeting information now doctors

1515
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:50,460
are actually putting it out there now

1516
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:53,310
recently there's been some doctors that

1517
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,570
they have books out there I have a

1518
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,460
feeling they don't like the fact that

1519
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,920
you know millions of medical media books

1520
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:01,080
have gotten all around the world and in

1521
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,150
doctors offices I think it does hurt

1522
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,930
because look everybody knows I'm not a

1523
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,270
doctor

1524
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,100
everybody knows that and I've never said

1525
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:10,110
it was a doctor but it does it does hurt

1526
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:13,800
I think the ego and a lot of people and

1527
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:16,200
so and they they know the information is

1528
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,270
solid and so they end up start saying

1529
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,830
well no no I knew I knew about you know

1530
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,290
pathogens feeding off of gluten oh yeah

1531
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:24,420
well no one knew and it never existed

1532
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:27,330
before the medical medium information

1533
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:30,450
and so you need to know that gluten

1534
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,910
feeds epstein-barr bars but it feeds all

1535
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:35,490
pathogens and that's where the problem

1536
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,530
lies why do you think you can be 80

1537
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,480
years old and eat all the gluten you

1538
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:42,060
want and never have a problem you know

1539
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,770
how many grandparents that can eat all

1540
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,720
the gluten they want and they don't

1541
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,910
understand why their 16-year old

1542
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,040
granddaughter can't have gluten

1543
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,570
because the 60-year old granddaughter is

1544
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,340
dealing with different varieties of

1545
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:55,650
strep which I'm going to talk about a

1546
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,900
streptococcus or they're dealing with an

1547
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,060
Epstein bar and or they're dealing with

1548
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,520
some some others have

1549
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,640
pathogen that the grandparents don't

1550
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,220
have or didn't add it's the same thing

1551
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:09,500
it's like why do you think young people

1552
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:12,230
can't eat gluten but yes unless so many

1553
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,180
older people can because the change of

1554
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,490
the times the different varieties of

1555
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,200
viruses the times are changing the

1556
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:20,420
mutations the fact that they're getting

1557
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,730
everywhere now the fact that the older

1558
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,610
generation had the older older varieties

1559
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:27,050
and many of them had no varieties it's

1560
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,820
why you've given nine year old that

1561
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,770
still can go and eat the gluten and so

1562
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,240
forth and what do they usually get they

1563
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,830
just usually get the heart disease

1564
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,810
because the heart disease is caused by

1565
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,340
all the other poor foods and the end of

1566
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,320
standard American diets and all that

1567
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,750
stuff they usually get other things but

1568
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,920
they don't get all the different

1569
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:44,720
symptoms and conditions and the

1570
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,460
neurological symptoms that these younger

1571
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,570
people that all you guys lived in so

1572
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,580
many people there could even be watching

1573
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:52,160
this is that I'm getting because the

1574
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:54,230
gluten feeds the epstein-barr virus it

1575
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,030
feeds the pathogens I'm talking about

1576
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:57,860
thyroid healing here you might want to

1577
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:00,710
get this book amazon.com I can't even

1578
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:02,470
touch us touch all the information it's

1579
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:07,220
in here it's going to something else do

1580
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:10,430
so here we are here we've got pasta

1581
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:13,190
right so we got some pasta so that's

1582
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:15,830
another one too gluten so that's where

1583
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:17,000
we get in trouble so you got the pasta

1584
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:18,950
you got the gluten but so many people

1585
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,180
can eat pasta you know it's with

1586
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:22,700
somebody and they're just like I was

1587
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:27,080
with with a really older friend it was a

1588
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:29,060
retired doctor and he's 79 years old and

1589
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,440
I'm out with him and I'm out with him

1590
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,420
and we're out of place we're getting

1591
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,210
some teens so he gets like a pasta dish

1592
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,890
and it's just straight out pasta it's

1593
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,230
got eggs in it it's got wheat the whole

1594
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:43,040
bed he's enjoying himself and you know

1595
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:45,170
and he can but someone else can't some

1596
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,470
reason for that and there's a reason for

1597
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,120
that

1598
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:48,770
that's how it works I'm trying to give

1599
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,250
you the rundown how viruses work on

1600
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:54,010
packaging worst and then

1601
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:54,760
you got the corn chips right there I got

1602
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,920
the corn chips

1603
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,020
so Lauren feed viruses it feeds bacteria

1604
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,810
you have to know this this is why if

1605
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:09,460
your corn used to be a perfect food a

1606
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:12,700
life-saving food it used to be an

1607
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:15,940
unbelievable food wheat was actually a

1608
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,410
good food a long time ago corn was

1609
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,910
actually a good food is the corn

1610
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,180
tortilla this is actually a fun one

1611
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:24,099
right corn tortillas so anybody just

1612
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,300
logged on its foods why why we get in

1613
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:26,650
trouble with certain foods and talk

1614
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,819
about the epstein-barr virus and talk

1615
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:29,349
about sickness I'm talking about all

1616
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:31,300
these different symptoms conditions

1617
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:32,349
people are going through struggles are

1618
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,810
going through you want to stay on for

1619
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:37,780
this talking about thyroid healing my

1620
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:40,180
book the bottom line is corn will feed

1621
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,310
pathogens though see these foods were

1622
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:44,710
ruined on us they were like the eggs

1623
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:48,520
okay so we've got the eggs here the eggs

1624
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:50,740
it's not your fault that this food that

1625
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:53,740
was a survival food that people actually

1626
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:55,450
need it and used and it was an important

1627
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,520
food it's not your fault they took it

1628
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,109
they raised bugs in labs and they let

1629
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,150
the bugs out and that's why sicknesses

1630
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:03,369
develop to the degree it has and it's

1631
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,720
exploded to the degree it asked and how

1632
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:06,940
young people are sick with so many

1633
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,720
symptoms and conditions okay this is why

1634
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:12,220
so it's not your fault okay it's not my

1635
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,829
fault I'm not trying to be the food

1636
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:17,380
police here they ruin the food not me I

1637
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:18,849
mean if they didn't ruin it I'd probably

1638
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,420
showing up some of these foods in the

1639
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,940
whole bit

1640
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:23,950
and then I want to talk about this food

1641
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,810
for a little bit right here there's that

1642
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:27,369
one you guys this is fun I hope you're

1643
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,839
having some fun it means a lot of

1644
00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:30,280
information it's really intense you want

1645
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:32,230
to watch this whole thing back again if

1647
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:35,349
to watch this from the start

1648
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,119
there's no question it's a powerful

1649
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:39,579
powerful episode to actually help you

1650
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,050
heal this food is an interesting food

1651
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:43,750
this is bacon now this is what's

1652
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,829
interesting here this won't feed viruses

1653
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,200
but you're going to think hey I could

1654
00:59:44,829 --> 00:59:50,740
eat bacon now no no no no no don't eat

1655
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:55,210
bacon pork won't feed the epstein-barr

1656
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:57,010
virus okay so see it's not about hey is

1657
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:58,240
he vegan is he not is he about

1658
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,210
plant-based is he

1659
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,300
is he is the anti a IP is he is he blood

1660
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:06,190
type would it what is he I don't I don't

1661
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,320
subscribe to a belief system because

1662
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:10,450
they're all wrong they're all wrong in

1663
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,890
so many ways every last one of them even

1664
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,750
the vegan diets don't even have the

1665
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:15,610
right even that even the vegetarian

1666
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:17,890
diets even than even all the different

1667
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:20,140
ones the paimio guys because they don't

1668
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,160
know what causes illness see I'm not in

1669
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,770
the food Wars

1670
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:26,410
I don't fight over the little stuff I

1671
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:29,530
talk about the real stuff in the food

1672
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:31,270
wars ok so because what they're doing

1673
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,070
out there they're kept busy like the

1674
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,780
vegans are throwing you know fake

1675
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,130
science that the paleo aliens are

1676
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,290
throwing fake science at the vegans

1677
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:40,300
because it's all paid for they don't

1678
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,950
realize it and everybody's throwing all

1679
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,810
the stuff back and forth and then you

1680
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,610
have you know diets like the IP and all

1681
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:48,400
AIP and all these are different diets

1682
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:50,290
and and it keeps on going but none of

1683
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,940
those diets know what causes illness

1684
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,070
they don't know about that what you're

1685
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,570
learning here they don't they don't know

1686
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,220
about the epstein-barr virus and how it

1687
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:01,120
works and how it feeds and what foods it

1688
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:03,340
feeds on and it's sad because because of

1689
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,140
that they flip-flop everybody's playing

1690
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,790
guessing games and the vegans get scared

1691
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,020
and they run to the Palio's again and

1692
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:09,730
they start eating animal products or

1693
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,860
starting to eat eggs or whatever it is

1694
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,120
and it's sad and then the Palio's they

1695
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,650
all get scared they don't know what

1696
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,120
they're eating they run to veganism and

1697
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,580
they run there and the plant-based and

1698
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:20,200
nobody realizes it and so everybody's

1699
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:21,670
confused and nobody really knows what's

1700
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,870
going on and all these different diets

1701
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:25,000
are made and everybody's trying to

1702
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,530
figure it out and it's sad because we're

1703
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,940
covering it now times but epstein-barr

1704
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:31,750
what it feeds off of now let's talk

1705
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:35,290
about bacon bacon doesn't feed FCU bar

1706
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:37,060
it doesn't feed viruses but you would

1707
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:38,890
think hey if Anthony's saying that then

1708
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,910
hey maybe it's good to eat no it's not

1709
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:43,150
that I'll tell you why

1710
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:45,490
bacon burden is a liver it kills the

1711
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:47,560
liver and pancreas and that's not good

1712
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:50,440
if you have epstein-barr that's not good

1713
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:52,570
if you have a virus that's giving you

1714
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,070
eggs and pains pains tangles numbness

1715
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:56,380
ringing in the ears tinnitus vertigo

1716
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,880
even if you have past doubts of it but

1717
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,680
you don't have it now that means you got

1718
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,160
the epstein-barr in the system and so

1719
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,720
hot flashes heart palpitations

1720
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,650
thyroid disorders of all kinds all the

1721
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,599
different diagnoses

1722
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:09,069
talked about Lyme disease behind the

1723
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,170
epstein-barr or more than one

1724
01:02:09,069 --> 01:02:13,029
epstein-barr in your system what can

1725
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:15,220
happen is if you're eating the bacon

1726
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:17,109
you're bombarding your liver with so

1727
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,700
much fact that it can't do its job it

1728
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:20,349
can't even hold up to its own immune

1729
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,760
system delivers own immune system which

1730
01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:23,500
I talked about in the medical media book

1731
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,420
series this is tyreq healing today

1732
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,579
though it's important to know and what

1733
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,740
happens is with all that fat in

1734
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:31,510
burdening your blood system depleting

1735
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,740
your blood of oxygen like I was talking

1736
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:34,390
about early like the dairy products

1737
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,579
where your oxygen levels are depleting

1738
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:38,020
and dropping down okay and the fats

1739
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:40,539
Werdum in your liver and it's burning

1740
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:43,210
your pancreas you can't defend yourself

1741
01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:45,549
against the epstein-barr so it grows and

1742
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:48,099
LIF rates it proliferate and actually

1743
01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:50,049
expands and grows over time it can speed

1744
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:52,599
your process up to getting sick down the

1745
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:54,190
road that's what it can do so that's

1746
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:55,990
what happens when you eat a food that

1747
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:58,569
doesn't feed the virus but yet puts you

1748
01:02:55,990 --> 01:03:01,809
in another way so important to

1749
01:02:58,569 --> 01:03:06,690
understand so we covered a few we

1750
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:09,369
covered a few foods right now okay

1751
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:11,710
here's a really big part right here you

1752
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:14,170
have to learn about illness because you

1753
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:18,010
can't blame yourself you can't blame

1754
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:21,069
your body you can't blame your body

1755
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:22,569
being faulty that you created it so

1756
01:03:21,069 --> 01:03:24,609
here's the thing that's happening now

1757
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:27,400
you guys and this is the war I feel like

1758
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:29,529
this is the worst what's happening is

1759
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,059
the industry's Big Pharma in the medical

1760
01:03:29,529 --> 01:03:32,770
industries all the industry is now

1761
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:35,410
including alternative industry all

1762
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:37,390
bought into something they bought into

1763
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:39,789
the body attacking itself they bought

1764
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:42,400
into the body the theory that the body

1765
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:45,490
is attacking itself or the theory that

1766
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,500
genes are behind your condition these

1767
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:49,720
are theories they're not proven and

1768
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,940
that's the theory of your body attacking

1769
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,930
itself like in celiac like an autoimmune

1770
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:59,319
see autoimmune means they don't know the

1771
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:01,720
cause so they say you're the cause

1772
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:03,430
that's how it works in autoimmune

1773
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,410
diseases of all kinds eczema psoriasis

1774
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:06,760
and celiac anything any kind of

1775
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:10,029
autoimmune disease doesn't matter what

1776
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,460
it is they believe that you're the cause

1777
01:04:10,029 --> 01:04:14,890
you see how it's been flipped that's how

1778
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,619
it's done they believe your body's

1779
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,779
attacking

1780
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:19,489
self so here you are going to dog here

1781
01:04:17,779 --> 01:04:20,900

1782

01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,579
something they all believe your body's

1794
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,049
attacking something you have an

1795
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:46,579
autoimmune condition if they diagnosed

1796
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:47,719
you with that autoimmune or been told or

1797
01:04:46,579 --> 01:04:49,369
you've been told that's what it is or

1798
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:51,559
whatever weather is that some psoriasis

1799
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:53,960
or so forth and that puts the blame on

1800
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:55,999
you the system's been setting us up and

1801
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,410
setting women up for a reason I'm gonna

1802
01:04:55,999 --> 01:04:59,869
go into that a little bit it's such an

1803
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:02,719
important episode right here it sets

1804
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:04,789
women up for disempowerment that's how

1805
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:07,069
you keep women weak that's how you break

1806
01:05:04,789 --> 01:05:09,499
them down and you beat them down and you

1807
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:13,940
break their spirits this is how it's

1808
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:16,309
done okay because there are real reasons

1809
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:18,650
why women are suffering and they're sick

1810
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:21,140
in and - but there's real reasons

1811
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:23,180
there's the epstein-barr liars wreaking

1812
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:24,079
havoc there's other viruses to them

1813
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:25,339
they're going to all the different

1814
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,839
viruses and so forth

1815
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:29,690
there's real reasons why they're sick

1816
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:31,759
the system created the situation on this

1817
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:34,069
theory that there's an auto antibody

1818
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:36,019
discovered back in the 1950s that's

1819
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:38,599
responsible for the body turning on

1820
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:41,239
itself first of all it's impossible look

1821
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:44,170
at technology in 1950 okay

1822
01:05:41,239 --> 01:05:47,119
trust me medicine 1950 was the dark ages

1823
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:48,469
dark ages the scariest thing you ever

1824
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,749
want to know how do I know

1825
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:52,369
I took the plenty of people I took the

1826
01:05:50,749 --> 01:05:54,859
plenty of doctors from the from the

1827
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:57,380
yesteryear it was a nightmare

1828
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:59,150
okay testing and medical testing and

1829
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:04,099
understanding of the body and everything

1830
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:06,410
was the dark ages in 1948 1949 okay and

1831
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:09,200
this is remedial at best let me see you

1832
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:11,690
need to know how it works so here's the

1833
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,039
deal when it comes down to the theory of

1834
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,140
hey it's autoimmune your body's

1835
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,519
attacking itself that was a very design

1836
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,210
because people were streaming into

1837
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:19,250
doctor's office

1838
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:22,100
nobody know what made them sick women

1839
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,360
were piling in to doctors offices all

1840
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,790
across the globe I talked to a doctor

1841
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:28,250
really old doctor who had a practice

1842
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:30,770
back then to retire really old doctor

1843
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:33,110
had practice back then and he said and

1844
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,360
he said it was like something they've

1845
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:37,610
never seen before and they were shoved

1846
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,010
by the medical industry this theory of

1847
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:41,660
the body attacking itself as being the

1848
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:43,100
blame and doctors knew it couldn't be

1849
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,900
possible he knew the body wasn't

1850
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:46,820
attacking itself but they had a they had

1851
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:49,070
to be trained that from there on out in

1852
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,560
the medical universities and the medical

1853
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:54,260
schools so what happens is its ultimate

1854
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:57,560
disempowerment it's body shaming it's

1855
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:59,090
body shaming is what it's doing so I'm

1856
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,710
gonna talk talk to you about how it

1857
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:04,100
works okay about a few other things with

1858
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:06,110
that so it's not genetics it's not the

1859
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:08,450
autoimmune theory of the body attacking

1860
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:10,190
itself that's messing people up it's not

1861
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:14,390
you creating it either

1862
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:17,240
okay it's not that what happens is we

1863
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:19,490
become deficient over time we're not

1864
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,410
getting the right foods in us we're not

1865
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:23,660
getting the things we need our immune

1866
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:26,000
systems we can do stress due to other

1867
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:29,030
problems heartbreak and so forth and all

1868
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,510
kinds of things poor diet occurs too as

1869
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:30,980
well

1870
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,180
so you're got the bacon in there and

1871
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:34,010
you're knocking out the oxygen so

1872
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:35,450
there's no option to stop any viruses or

1873
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:37,400
pathogens you've got the gluten in there

1874
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,720
you're feeding pathogens you're feeding

1875
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,220
things that's what you're doing you're

1876
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,600
drinking some kefir because you think

1877
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,220
that's the answer and you're doing that

1878
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,050
you're eating some eggs and you're

1879
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,810
actually feeding the viruses and the

1880
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:49,280
pathogens is what you're doing and

1881
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:50,660
you're doing that and at the same time

1882
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,820
you're weakening your immune system

1883
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,280
you're lowering your immune system and

1884
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:56,960
the diet gets the diets poor along the

1885
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:58,820
way you're losing trace minerals like

1886
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,590
zinc because of stress and because of

1887
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:02,120
life there's all kinds of iron mental

1888
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:03,560
toxins coming in you're getting broken

1889
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,880
down you're getting heck toxic heavy

1890
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,590
metals you might have already started

1891
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,140
out in soil for toxic heavy metals and

1892
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:12,020
that's what's happening and then boom

1893
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,670
you end up getting mononucleosis or your

1894
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,590
first doubt of it that's not discovered

1895
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:18,530
stage 2 happens and you get this your

1896
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:20,030
first mononucleosis and it's hasn't even

1897
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:21,710
discovered because you just tired for a

1898
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,450
week and then it goes away it could be a

1899
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,000
real mild one or it could be a severe

1900
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,009
one either way that's how the virus

1901
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,989
moves into state

1902
01:08:27,009 --> 01:08:30,130
- so I talked about the foods I talked

1903
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:32,770
about how that works I've talked about

1904
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:35,470
how women are being disempowered because

1905
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:37,600
women on this planet or world changers

1906
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:39,390
their powerful world changers and they

1907
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,290
just wanted to tell you that last part

1908
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:44,380
but when you get run down

1909
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:45,759
and you stand you get the flu and you're

1910
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:47,710
not eating good and you're getting

1911
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,720
deficient and you're not taking care of

1912
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:50,529
yourself and all these other things are

1913
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,970
happening because you're not being

1914
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:53,620
taught to take care of yourself or you

1915
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:56,049
just got too much going on in your life

1916
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:57,460
and then you get heartbreak or something

1917
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:59,710
else and you throw it all in or just

1918
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:01,390
stress of every day everything the

1919
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:03,370
immune system starts to weaken and break

1920
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:04,930
down is what happens and you end up

1921
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:06,250
going to the doctor with the diagnosis

1922
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:08,020
it's not even the right one

1923
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,670
it's not even hey you're viral now we

1924
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:11,500
have to get some antivirals in you we

1925
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:12,910
have to get you better instead it's wait

1926
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,259
a minute you might have autoimmune and

1927
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:15,580
your body's attacking itself and now

1928
01:09:14,259 --> 01:09:17,080
you're driving home from the doctor's

1929
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:19,509
office thinking your body's worthless

1930
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,130
and it's faulty so with all that else we

1931
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:24,279
have going on this is how this

1932
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:26,380
empowerment for everybody goes so the

1933
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,150
body's immune system is that war with

1934
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:29,799
epstein-barr in stage 2 I want to go

1935
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,690
into that a little bit there's a stage 2

1936
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:33,339
with epstein-barr so first of all stage

1937
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:37,180
1 is about it incubating in the body

1938
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:39,480
stage 2 is about the war that occurs

1939
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,739
with epstein-barr time our thyroid

1940
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,779
healing the most comprehensive Epstein

1941
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:46,569
Barr book on the planet now make sure

1942
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:48,700
you get it there's over 60 varieties of

1943
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:50,350
Epstein Barr remember that so everybody

1944
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,600
could have a different one different one

1945
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:54,730
some could be more severe so it could be

1946
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,590
let much less of the earth some another

1947
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,940
person's immune system might be stronger

1948
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:59,620
than another person's they might have

1949
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,150
less toxins they might have less issues

1950
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:03,790
going on their life so they're they're

1951
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:05,440
mononucleosis is really mild somebody

1952
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:07,420
else had mononucleosis could be really

1953
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,130
severe they got much more of a severe or

1954
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:11,470
aggressive form of Epstein Barr really

1955
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:14,200
important to know but the body's at war

1956
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:16,239
with the epstein-barr stage two is when

1957
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,560
there's a war going on so that's what's

1958
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,989
happening there so that's the stage

1959
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,820
stage two is stage two is your immune

1960
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:22,900
system so that's your white blood cells

1961
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:24,460
right here so you got all these

1962
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,680
different white blood cells going on me

1963
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:28,989
guys so hang in there for this little

1964
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:33,100
show get lymphocytes she got monocytes

1965
01:10:28,989 --> 01:10:34,600
you got neutrophils you got you got the

1966
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,640
whole bit okay I'm trying to make it

1967
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,770
interesting anyway you're in me to get

1968
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,980
your killer cells right we just say that

1969
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:42,889
your

1970
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:45,110
so we have those they're there and they

1971
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:47,270
become the they basically go into war

1972
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:48,530
with the bad guys is what happens so

1973
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,840
here's your virus the epstein-barr virus

1974
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:53,210
that stage 2 comes out of incubation and

1975
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:58,449
now boom there's a war happening but the

1976
01:10:53,210 --> 01:11:01,489
virus over time realizes realizes that

1977
01:10:58,449 --> 01:11:04,190
it's going to lose the war because your

1978
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:08,000
immune system tags it your immune system

1979
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:10,310
releases a hormone a chemical compound

1980
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,650
your immune system releases is it what

1981
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:14,239
it does so your white blood cells

1982
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:16,909
releases chemical compound chemical

1983
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,500
compound attaches itself to the virus is

1984
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:20,300
what it does so the chemical compound

1985
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,829
released by your immune system by your

1986
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:24,829
lymphocytes okay

1987
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:27,469
tagged the virus so then when they tags

1988
01:11:24,829 --> 01:11:30,349
the virus the virus knows it can't be in

1989
01:11:27,469 --> 01:11:32,510
the body in the bloodstream fighting too

1990
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:34,369
much longer because that means you're

1991
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:36,409
gonna win the battle so there's this

1992
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:38,030
battle going on in stage 2 epstein-barr

1993
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:39,409
happens to everybody in anybody's life

1994
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,820
it doesn't matter if they felt like they

1995
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:42,170
thought they just had the flu for three

1996
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:43,730
weeks or the flu for two weeks and it

1997
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,460
wasn't the flu or it was a flu trigger

1998
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:48,320
off their epstein-barr or whatever it is

1999
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,610
what happens is they have their white

2000
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,310
blood count their white blood count

2001
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:54,290
releases a phytochemical compound I mean

2002
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:56,239
sorry chemical compound for the body it

2003
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:57,860
goes right on to the virus sticks to the

2004
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:00,650
virus and now the viruses days are

2005
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:02,960
numbered okay you start winning the war

2006
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:04,849
so that's how it works you start winning

2007
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,560
the war your your spit your mono

2008
01:12:04,849 --> 01:12:08,239
symptoms start to die down you start

2009
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,099
getting your strength back your sore

2010
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:11,239
throat your fever or headache and rashes

2011
01:12:10,099 --> 01:12:13,790
whatever it could be happening

2012
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:15,770
whatever's going on could start to die

2013
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:17,540
down and that's how it works okay

2014
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:19,010
symptoms can come and go over time but

2015
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:21,679
it starts to die down because your white

2016
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:23,300
count is winning but then your virus has

2017
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,130
to go somewhere so the Epstein virus

2018
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:27,050
actually has to go somewhere so it picks

2019
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:28,909
a home is what it does it heads

2020
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:30,650
somewhere it heads for the liver is

2021
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:32,510
where it loves to go it can head to the

2022
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:34,429
spleen to but the spleen but the liver

2023
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:35,989
is where it loves the most and it's the

2024
01:12:34,429 --> 01:12:38,449
most important spot because it has the

2025
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:40,460
most fuel has the most food it has all

2026
01:12:38,449 --> 01:12:40,730
that food I'm talking about stored up in

2027
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,130
it

2028
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:44,150
how's that bacon fat in there it has the

2029
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:46,160
gluten I talked to

2030
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:48,200
it has the milk in there it has toxins

2031
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:50,240
it has toxic heavy metals as mercury and

2032
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,640
they're defeated it's got aluminum it's

2033
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,440
got cadmium nickel arsenic it's got lead

2034
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,870
it's got all these different copper it's

2035
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:58,610
got metals in there and so the virus

2036
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:01,210
likes to sit inside the liver inside

2037
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:03,470
that garbage dump and it goes to sleep

2038
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,510
feeds and then sleeps just like

2039
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:07,490
Thanksgiving right you're getting a big

2040
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:09,380
turkey and then you hop on this finan

2041
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:12,110
you hop on the couch and now you're

2042
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:14,030
going to sleep you know and it just sits

2043
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:16,370
inside the liver and it has that that

2044
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:17,480
Thanksgiving meal and then it goes to

2045
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,860
sleep and then it has another

2046
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,990
Thanksgiving meal and it goes to sleep

2047
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:24,050
and then it start to reproduce itself is

2048
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:26,090
what it does because it still reproduces

2049
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:28,310
itself it grows its numbers it

2050
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:31,220
proliferate s-- over time causing

2051
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:33,140
problems and unfortunately that's where

2052
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:34,760
we go into like the ant we go into them

2053
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:36,200
and if you're not doing it to a virus

2054
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,150
and if you're not taking away the foods

2055
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,530
that it loves to feed on and if you're

2056
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:42,680
not cleaning up your toxic heavy metals

2057
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:44,120
it grows inside the liver and get us in

2058
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:46,190
trouble and that virus gets in trouble

2059
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:48,410
and the immune system doesn't even know

2060
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:50,780
it's there anymore the immune systems

2061
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:52,820
going around the body and doesn't see it

2062
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:55,820
in the bloodstream anymore and thinks it

2063
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:57,500
won the war so your immune system kind

2064
01:13:55,820 --> 01:14:00,020
of goes back into dormancy to not

2065
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,930
dormancy back into the usual grind the

2066
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:06,380
everyday grind of life is what it does

2067
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:07,910
and this virus FC Morra stays inside the

2068
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:11,000
liver and incubates in there that's how

2069
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:13,810
it works okay going into another part

2070
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,280
here okay we're going into stage three

2071
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:20,600
epstein-barr so let's do that then it

2072
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,160
happens a lot of information gonna have

2073
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,540
to have some celery juice right there

2074
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:29,240
but--my back up so stage three a lot of

2075
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:31,400
people experience mono but don't get it

2076
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,990
diagnosed with mono so they experience

2077
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,910
mono so so many people experience

2078
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:36,250
symptoms they get rundown in college for

2079
01:14:34,910 --> 01:14:38,630
a little bit they don't go to a doctor

2080
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,610
they get it running down not everybody

2081
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:43,550
goes to a doctor doctor does even look

2082
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:45,860
for mono so what there's millions and

2083
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:47,930
millions and millions of people who had

2084
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:50,210
mono that didn't even know they had mono

2085
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:52,640
but yet they have little Iran symptoms

2086
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:55,010
they have stage 3 because they don't

2087
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,920
know they even had stage 1 because they

2088
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,210
were never even guys

2089
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,680
and even if they weren't diagnosed

2090
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,090
there's no information out there but the

2091
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:03,660
medical meeting information that tells

2092
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:06,360
you how the stages work so Stage three

2093
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:08,340
is when the virus leaves the liver and

2094
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:10,110
heads to the thyroid so it goes to the

2095
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,760
thyroid masque what happens so the virus

2096
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:13,080
starts to go up the thyroid that's what

2097
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,670
it does it goes up to the thyroid to say

2098
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,650
this tortilla your thyroid the virus

2099
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:20,400
swings up the thyroid enters the thyroid

2100
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:23,160
and you start getting your slowly start

2101
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,870
getting your thyroid conditions and it

2102
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,490
could range in any of them so you're 38

2103
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,820
years old you're a woman you're 38 years

2104
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:29,310
old

2105
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:31,860
you get discovered that there's a little

2106
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:33,390
nodule on your thyroid that's because

2107
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,640
I've seen bars been there for a long

2108
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:37,020
time working on it that's how it works I

2109
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,900
talk about this information all in

2110
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,580
thyroid healing so maybe you're getting

2111
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,050
hypothyroidism it's not going to show up

2112
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,700
on a blood test it's not going to show

2113
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:46,800
them there because you've already had

2114
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:49,740
mono once before so here you go

2115
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,210
the virus can actually travel to the

2116
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:53,460
thyroid it's not going to show up on a

2117
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:55,290
blood test this is how it's escaped

2118
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,800
their medical system this is how it's

2119
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:58,140
worked

2120
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,060
doctors will most likely see antibodies

2121
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,740
to a past infection that's how

2122
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,240
indicating you had a past infection if

2123
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:04,860
they're really looking hard but they

2124
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,230
won't believe your thyroid problems or

2125
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:09,000
know their thyroid problems they believe

2126
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:10,560
it when they learn so many doctors are

2127
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,270
learning this information now from

2128
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,310
medical medium book series but they

2129
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:15,870
won't know that that's what's causing a

2130
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:17,640
thyroid problems your hypothyroidism

2131
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:19,050
your hyperthyroidism these your

2132
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,340
different writers of epstein-barr you

2133
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:23,070
can have hypothyroidism and

2134
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,480
hyperthyroidism all at the same time you

2135
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:25,800
can actually have them both because you

2136
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,900
can have two varieties of I've seen bar

2137
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,510
inside your thyroid that's how it works

2138
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:32,760
this is where the mistake happens

2139
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:34,440
meanwhile the virus becomes active again

2140
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,300
it travels from the liver to the thyroid

2141
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,950
causing problems and it fills your

2142
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,420
thyroid with toxins and poisons and it

2143
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:41,820
fills your liver with toxins and poisons

2144
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,710
and your lymphatic system gets all

2145
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:46,320
clogged up with these toxic the toxic

2146
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:48,510
poisons your lymphocytes get weak your

2147
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,740
lymphocytes around your thyroid get weak

2148
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,390
and they're not doing the job they're

2149
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,700
not even able to actually knock down

2150
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:55,530
epstein-barr because we're still eating

2151
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:57,000
the wrong foods we still have to toxic

2152
01:16:55,530 --> 01:16:58,470
heavy metals we're still not cleaning or

2153
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,330
system up we're still not doing all the

2154
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:01,650
right things for ourselves medical

2155
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:03,510
research in science

2156
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,580
yet detected this information or

2157
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:08,040
detected the epstein-barr your thyroid

2158
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:09,179
has its own immune system research the

2159
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,489
science doesn't know that your thyroid

2160
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:13,980
has its own immune system well what

2161
01:17:11,489 --> 01:17:15,929
happens is over time the virus will

2162
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,640
distract and wear down your overall

2163
01:17:15,929 --> 01:17:18,810
body's immune system so I want to talk

2164
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,949
about this next part you got to watch

2165
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:21,890
this whole thing over again this

2166
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:25,590
information is really intense

2167
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:27,630
over time the virus has in stage four it

2168
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:29,190
wants to go to stage four okay that's

2169
01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:30,360
what it wants to do that's a viruses

2170
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:34,140
want to do they always want to go to

2171
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:36,060
stage four and so this stage what they

2172
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,219
do is the viruses leave the liver and

2173
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,040
they start to break down the immune

2174
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:42,330
system they start to wear it down they

2175
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,920
stay in the liver and wear down the

2176
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:45,270
immune system the livers immune system

2177
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,650
they go out and they leave they wear

2178
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:49,469
down the immune system they release a

2179
01:17:46,650 --> 01:17:51,210
tremendous amount of by-product toxic

2180
01:17:49,469 --> 01:17:53,580
byproducts so these viruses release

2181
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:55,650
toxic by-product and that toxic

2182
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:57,270
by-product starts to break down the

2183
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:58,650
immune system throughout the entire body

2184
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,060
and that's when people start getting

2185
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:01,469
some different symptoms you start

2186
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:03,150
getting hot flashes and they start

2187
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:04,710
getting different heart palpitations

2188
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,239
because they got all this viral

2189
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:08,760
by-product floating around through their

2190
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:11,310
body and this is how this is how they

2191
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,409
start getting brain fog so what happens

2192
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:15,300
is you get the brain fog because you're

2193
01:18:13,409 --> 01:18:17,040
on the edge of stage three stage for

2194
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,780
epstein-barr nobody knew it's been

2195
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,640
traveling throughout the body over the

2196
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:23,489
years it might have one or two varieties

2197
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,770
because the viruses that viruses are

2198
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:27,270
releasing a battery of poisons and

2199
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:29,370
toxins so that's what the epstein-barr

2200
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:31,800
does it releases a battery of poisons

2201
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:33,540
and toxins and as these poisons and

2202
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:36,150
toxins are floating around and floating

2203
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:38,550
around they weaken the immune system the

2204
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:40,110
reason why is because they need the weak

2205
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:42,510
in the immune system because they want

2206
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:45,449
to get to that next level they want to

2207
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:47,610
take your lymphocytes and distract them

2208
01:18:45,449 --> 01:18:49,800
that's what the viruses want to do they

2209
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:52,770
want to distract your immune system so

2210
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,840
the thyroid becomes naked so it's there

2211
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,760
for more viruses to feed into your

2212
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,440
thyroid to go into the thyroid to feed

2213
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,020
on it so there's an action strategy

2214
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,790
viruses use that may sound scary but not

2215
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:04,230
if you have the right information not if

2216
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:05,730
you know how to heal that if you're not

2217
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:06,900
going to heal like so many thousands and

2218
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:08,580
hundreds of thousands of people all over

2219
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,679
the planet that use them books and heal

2220
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:12,780
you can actually arm yourself and

2221
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:14,100
actually heal you can heal your head

2222
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:15,570
and you could reverse it you could

2223
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,100
reverse all these different symptoms

2224
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:20,520
conditions all the stuff is really

2225
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:22,530
important so Stage four occurs when the

2226
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:25,650
body's immune system has been distracted

2227
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:26,970
and then the virus deals with the

2228
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:28,980
nervous systems that's when all the

2229
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:31,140
neurological symptoms start the eggs the

2230
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:32,610
pains the neurological fatigue all the

2231
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:34,980
different symptoms people get

2232
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:38,250
neurologically the anxiety the anxiety

2233
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:39,810
is caused by toxins being released by

2234
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:41,910
the epstein-barr virus floating around

2235
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:43,320
getting into the brain short-circuiting

2236
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:45,390
neurotransmitters a neurotransmitter

2237
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,280
camera holes weaken they start to

2238
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:48,030
dehydrate electrical impulses start to

2239
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,070
short-circuit

2240
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:52,230
that's what the virus does in stage four

2241
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:54,030
and so you start getting neurological

2242
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:55,230
symptoms your vagus nerve gets affected

2243
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,460
and I want to go into the vagus nerve

2244
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,810
for a couple of minutes you guys I know

2245
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,090
there's a lot of information and

2246
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:03,870
probably surprised you today with this

2247
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:05,400
live but it's so important so vagus

2248
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:06,870
nerve that's you're nervous that runs

2249
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,340
that he comes out of the brain it runs

2250
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:09,720
right down through your neck it runs

2251
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:11,690
right down your chest right down to your

2252
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,090
stomach right there that's the ultimate

2253
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:16,290
anxiety creating nerve it's not because

2254
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,760
your faulty it's not because you're

2255
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:19,110
mental it's not because you've got all

2256
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,850
these problems not because you're a bad

2257
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:22,050
person stuff because you're creating it

2258
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:25,290
with bad thoughts it's not because of

2259
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:27,810
any of that none of that helps if you

2260
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:29,910
got bad thoughts of course none of that

2261
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:31,560
helps but if you have a weakened vagus

2262
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:33,450
nerve that's already slightly inflamed

2263
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,580
from neurotoxins being produced in stage

2264
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:37,050
four by epstein-barr virus you're gonna

2265
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,220
have more of a sensitive baby star if

2266
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,600
you're gonna get tightness of chest

2267
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:41,400
you're gonna get panic attacks easy

2268
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,660
you're gonna get on and off in your life

2269
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,370
you're gonna have anxiety you're gonna

2270
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,510
feel all kind of like jittery you're

2271
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,770
gonna get shakes you're gonna get

2272
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:49,740
tingles and numbness you're gonna get

2273
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:51,960
different things all of this is symptoms

2274
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:53,550
of epstein-barr including you have

2275
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,140
ringing in the ears on and off and I

2276
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:56,610
know that a lot of you are like wait

2277
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:58,430
there's ringing in my ear someone's

2278
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:00,090
talking about me no that's not how it is

2279
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:02,220
ringing in the ears

2280
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:04,410
on and off intermittently on and off is

2281
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:06,360
an early sign that you got some EBV and

2282
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,650
you have to address it now because 20

2283
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,790
years from now you won't be saying hey

2284
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:10,380
somebody's talking about me anymore

2285
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,570
you'll be out of 10 doctors trying to

2286
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,070
get rid of your tinnitus it's important

2287
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,720
to have this information the one thing I

2288
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:17,400
don't play around with is fake

2289
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:19,520
information that's out there that just

2290
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:21,870
travels around and all of the healing

2291
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,700
modalities and all the healing movements

2292
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,360
that's all just I don't even know where

2293
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:26,490
this stuff

2294
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:29,040
from you have to deal with real

2295
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:30,870
information in order to heal and not get

2296
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,440
tricked in full this is just the way it

2297
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,440
goes

2298
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:36,240
ringing the ears periodically you gotta

2299
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:38,580
know you want to catch that early before

2300
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,960
it turns into odds not a lot of tinnitus

2301
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,240
down the road you got to know that

2302
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:44,280
tangles have numbness tingling numbness

2303
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,840
is sure you know when you're talking

2304
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,700
about ghost stories and it's at night

2305
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,770
and you're watching a lady outside of a

2306
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,420
ghost story show or something like that

2307
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,590
you might get the tingles up the back of

2308
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,150
the neck and the goosebumps and

2309
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:55,740
everything but I'm talking about tingles

2310
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:58,380
and numbness that comes periodically for

2311
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:00,750
no reason whatsoever you know connect

2312
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:02,550
restless leg syndrome tics spasms

2313
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:05,850
twitches floaters in the eyes and

2314
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:07,470
buzzing buzzing in the ears sounds in

2315
01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:10,100
the ears popping in the ears heart

2316
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:12,960
palpitations plantar fasciitis brain fog

2317
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:16,020
confusion anxiety depression all start

2318
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,550
to occur with stage for epstein-barr you

2319
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:22,290
can have stage for epstein-barr at age

2320
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:24,360
13 14 15 16 whatever age 25 age 30 age

2321
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:27,540
40 the whole bit should just even know

2322
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,250
that neuro fatigue fatigue where your

2323
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,660
legs feel like cement you know it breaks

2324
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,820
my heart when I know people even go

2325
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,350
through any of this it kills me because

2326
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,330
especially when they've gone to doctors

2327
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:37,470
and you know they're yeah playing around

2328
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,790
with diets and things are getting a

2329
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:41,010
little better here and there and whatnot

2330
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:43,260
but they're not safe until they know

2331
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:45,360
what to do and he'll wash it for too

2332
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,250
many times I talk to too many doctors so

2333
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,830
the neuro fatigue the legs feel like

2334
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:51,450
bags of cement on them you know or you

2335
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:53,610
just feel like you can't push through

2336
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:55,230
you got to take naps during the day you

2337
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:56,730
need a nap in the middle of the day you

2338
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,630
got to lay down on the couch you got to

2339
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:59,790
close your eyes

2340
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:01,380
and and that's really hard for so many

2341
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:03,090
people and then you can't function you

2342
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,320
can't work or you you're working but

2343
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,910
you're not working at the peace and you

2344
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,010
get the brain fog with it all of it is

2345
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:09,300
so difficult and they can't get it man

2346
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:11,100
what about the people they can't get out

2347
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,510
of bed at all you guys and some of you

2348
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,670
probably know that are and some of you

2349
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:17,490
are them then you can even get out to

2350
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:19,410
get out of the bed in the morning and

2351
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:21,630
you have the deep neurological fatigue

2352
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:23,100
that's medical medium information

2353
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:25,530
neurological fatigue that's the whole

2354
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:27,030
point it's not just fatigue neurological

2355
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:28,860
fatigue it's your nervous system and

2356
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:30,840
there's a way to heal that's the stage

2357
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:32,550
for epstein-barr so many some people get

2358
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,890
a three Epstein bars foot around our

2359
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,840
system and it could be releasing these

2360
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:39,170
neurotoxins

2361
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,020
get out of bed and then Shannon Denham

2362
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:43,550
you're eating butter you're drinking

2363
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:45,619
coffee and having butter in your coffee

2364
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:47,389
to make you sicker and then you're doing

2365
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:49,219
eggs because you know no one's taught

2366
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,900
you that eggs actually feed the viruses

2367
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:54,159
nobody tells you that it is viruses so

2368
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:57,070
this is how you get in trouble and

2369
01:23:54,159 --> 01:24:00,050
everybody is getting these symptoms

2370
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:02,750
decades before their grandmothers got

2371
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:05,869
the symptoms they're getting it decades

2372
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:08,570
before you know what I mean that here's

2373
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:10,460
how it works look what I mean by decades

2374
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:13,540
before the grandmothers that means their

2375
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:17,179
grandmothers didn't get the symptoms and

2376
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:20,060
in their life until later on in their

2377
01:24:17,179 --> 01:24:23,830
life the grandmothers got the symptoms

2378
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:28,190
later on in their life most of them and

2379
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:31,760
now younger women are getting it at all

2380
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:33,199
ages and when they have a window where

2381
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,730
they're not having it and they're able

2382
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,560
to go to school they're able to go to

2383
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:37,820
college and able to graduate and they're

2384
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,560
able to start a career and they're able

2385
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:41,300
to go out to restaurants and drink wine

2386
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:42,320
and do whatever they want and go out

2387
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,239
with friends and all this other stuff

2388
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,210
and go travel around the world and all

2389
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:49,400
this it's only a short window it's

2390
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:51,349
wholly a short window it's this

2391
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:55,520
information they should take the heart

2392
01:24:51,349 --> 01:24:58,400
it's only a short window unless you know

2393
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:00,290
what creates illness what creates

2394
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,360
chronic symptoms and conditions because

2395
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:04,280
it sneaks up on everybody no matter what

2396
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,230
I'm watching it I have watched you for

2397
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,480
over 35 years

2398
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:10,070
doctors watch it every day it's no one's

2399
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,590
getting away with it unless you know

2400
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:15,110
what the heck is going on and know how

2401
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:16,400
to heal it know what you need to do know

2402
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:18,530
how to heal it get the fiber and

2403
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:21,920
information get know what foods to stop

2404
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:24,800
know what all of it and other stuff too

2405
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,980
listen it's getting worse than ever once

2406
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,989
before and faster it's getting worse and

2407
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,400
faster EBD is more aggressive than ever

2408
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:33,920
was before and people are collecting

2409
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,920
them like collecting stamps and

2410
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:39,560
collecting coins look I get it if you're

2411
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,810
a critic or a skeptic and you don't

2412
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:43,250
understand how epstein-barr works and

2413
01:25:41,810 --> 01:25:45,260
you don't understand

2414
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:48,020
how it's the blame for a huge part of

2415
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:49,760
our populations illness I get it you

2416
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:52,070
know you're gonna be like hey no way

2417
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:56,360
this doesn't make sense I get it I get

2418
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:59,750
it but it's actually the way it is you

2419
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:02,060
know this live is critical for you to

2420
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:04,610
know if you're a skeptic watch this live

2421
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:06,080
a couple of times be open-minded be

2422
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,820
open-minded for the people that need the

2423
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,820
help it's really important

2424
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:13,370
Epstein Barr is a blame for our

2425
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:15,380
population sickness a huge part don't

2426
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:17,110
get me wrong I talk about other viruses

2427
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,520
and I'm gonna go into that a little bit

2428
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:21,440
regardless of anyway the Epstein bars

2429
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:23,150
and entered your body through areas of

2430
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,310
the body fluids or any other way

2431
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:27,110
it runs these four stages and you can

2432
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,550
stop it and you can heal and you can

2433
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:29,900
move forward that's why people heal from

2434
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,699
the Lyme disease I'm medically in the

2435
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:33,380
information multiple sclerosis on there

2436
01:26:31,699 --> 01:26:34,940
and medical medium information all these

2437
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:36,140
different symptoms conditions on it

2438
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:38,300
that's why they get their lives back

2439
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:41,030
that's why they lose weight the stories

2440
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,520
everywhere Women's World magazine that

2441
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:45,920
publication showcases it has a spread in

2442
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,020
the magazine every month every other

2443
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,150
month medical meeting people actually

2444
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:52,160
healing from all the stuff they did they

2445
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:53,600
would never pay to do it they did it on

2446
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,640
their own they did it with the books

2447
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,430
they get it with the information first

2448
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,870
for women always also talk about that so

2449
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:01,610
these different publications that know

2450
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:03,500
the informations healing people they see

2451
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:06,410
if they see these miraculous stories you

2452
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:09,560
guys see it every day so let's talk

2453
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:12,949
about some different things epstein-barr

2454
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:14,239
is different because it runs through

2455
01:27:12,949 --> 01:27:16,430
different parts of the body

2456
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:18,530
EB V goes through all kinds of different

2457
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,210
parts of the body causes different

2458
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:22,219
problems I've explained so I've seen

2459
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:24,230
Barker go to the thyroid it can go to

2460
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:26,270
others it goes to the liver it goes to

2461
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:28,040
the reproductive system it can go to the

2462
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:29,660
brain it can do a lot of different

2463
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:31,040
things neurotoxins and float around and

2464
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:33,320
go to the brain so let's talk about why

2465
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,090
a woman for a couple of minutes why

2466
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,650
women in such greater numbers are

2467
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:37,969
getting affected with chronic illness

2468
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:39,590
and getting epstein-barr to such a

2469
01:27:37,969 --> 01:27:41,719
degree one of the biggest physical

2470
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:43,489
differences is the menstrual cycle when

2471
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:44,750
a woman has her menstrual cycle eight

2472
01:27:43,489 --> 01:27:47,330
percent of her immune system gets

2473
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:49,460
knocked down okay so when 80 percent of

2474
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:53,210
our immune system gets knocked down once

2475
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:54,269
a month it leaves everything open for a

2476
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:56,159
virus of pathogen

2477
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,840
anything else so say a woman has two

2478
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,400
varieties of streptococcus and they got

2479
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,260
they got acne all the time or they had

2480
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,659
strep throat in their life and they have

2481
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,650
acne okay or they had ear infections

2482
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,760
when they were younger when they have

2483
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:07,800
their menstrual cycles when they're

2484
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,769
getting older their immune system drops

2485
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:13,079
down 80% of the immune system drops down

2486
01:28:10,769 --> 01:28:15,840
because each month the reproductive

2487
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,119
system in a woman demands a tremendous

2488
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,820
amount of energy and resources it

2489
01:28:18,119 --> 01:28:22,559
demands full attention for it for

2490
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:24,960
resources is what it does the

2491
01:28:22,559 --> 01:28:28,920
reproductive system needs almost its

2492
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:31,499
entire immune system governing over it

2493
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:34,409
so that she could prepare her body to

2494
01:28:31,499 --> 01:28:35,699
having a baby so what happens is that

2495
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:38,070
when you have your reproductive system

2496
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:39,630
coming up it's the body puts be

2497
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:40,920
preparing that's the body preparing

2498
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:43,409
itself to have babies the menstrual

2499
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,809
cycle is critical so what happens here

2500
01:28:43,409 --> 01:28:47,820
is 80% of the immune system drops down

2501
01:28:45,809 --> 01:28:51,030
and goes to the reproductive system is

2502
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:53,159
where it goes and it goes towards the

2503
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:55,559
womb it's critical that it goes towards

2504
01:28:53,159 --> 01:28:58,710
the womb and there's a reason for this

2505
01:28:55,559 --> 01:29:01,289
because it's preparing it's guarding and

2506
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:05,670
preparing cleaning and prepping the

2507
01:29:01,289 --> 01:29:07,349
reproductive system to to you know pass

2508
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:09,150
on generations and generations and

2509
01:29:07,349 --> 01:29:10,739
generations to start generations it's

2510
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:14,670
our way to survive and live so the

2511
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:17,130
immune system drops down so ok so that

2512
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:19,559
means once a month just with that alone

2513
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:21,599
a woman's immune system drops down and

2514
01:29:19,559 --> 01:29:23,159
weekends so if there's an Epstein bar

2515
01:29:21,599 --> 01:29:25,230
just caught recently through a

2516
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:27,539
relationship or through a friendship or

2517
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:28,889
through anything or through any kind or

2518
01:29:27,539 --> 01:29:31,050
in a restaurant all the different things

2519
01:29:28,889 --> 01:29:32,489
or a public bathroom or a family member

2520
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:35,429
and Epstein bar is passed on to one

2521
01:29:32,489 --> 01:29:37,199
person to another and that menstrual

2522
01:29:35,429 --> 01:29:38,789
cycle is happening and then also stress

2523
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:40,139
is happening in that person's life in

2524
01:29:38,789 --> 01:29:41,400
that woman's life and stress and

2525
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:43,289
different things or hardships or

2526
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,969
whatever it is the immune system can get

2527
01:29:43,289 --> 01:29:47,190
kicked down a lot throughout the body

2528
01:29:44,969 --> 01:29:49,469
and the virus can actually proliferate

2529
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:52,920
because of that reason alone and then

2530
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:54,840
there's ovulation where 40% of the

2531
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,699
body's immune system has to go to the

2532
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:59,760
reproductive system during ovulation

2533
01:29:56,699 --> 01:30:01,860
once again preparing the woman for

2534
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:05,610
conception and the whole bit this means

2535
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:07,280
twice a month a woman's immune system is

2536
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:10,220
weakened down one of the men's

2537
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:12,650
man's immune system is not that's why

2538
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:15,620
men don't get chronic illness to the

2539
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:17,930
degree women do okay so that's one of

2540
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:20,060
the big reasons it's also why women get

2541
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:22,610
acne during the menstrual cycle because

2542
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:23,270
since our immune system lowers after

2543
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,530
being accursed

2544
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:27,320
because acne is caused by streptococcus

2545
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:30,320
not hormones C hormones was the old

2546
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,790
blame game it started out with hormones

2547
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:33,860
and it started out with the body's

2548
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:36,920
attacking itself now it's now it's going

2549
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:38,870
to genes these are all blame games on

2550
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,270
women and their bodies trying to train

2551
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:43,280
them their bodies were faulty that their

2552
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:45,710
bodies were weak or they create it and

2553
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:47,900
that's what it's all to sell hormones

2554
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:49,670
it's all to sell different drugs it's

2555
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,440
all to sell things and that's why that

2556
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:54,790
whole system was created back in the day

2557
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:58,070
but what causes acne during during

2558
01:30:54,790 --> 01:31:00,170
menstruation during a cycle causes acne

2559
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:02,900
is streptococcus so that's what causes

2560
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:05,000
it strike strep bacterias and strep

2561
01:31:02,900 --> 01:31:06,500
bacteria streptococcus is a cofactor to

2562
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,540
epstein-barr that means it's trucks

2563
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,890
around epstein-barr lives in the body to

2564
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,660
always remember that so if you have

2565
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:13,730
strep as a child that means there's an

2566
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:15,800
Epstein bar in in in the child too

2567
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:18,440
that's how it works there's over 50

2568
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:20,570
groups of strep with multiple strains

2569
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,820
per group and science research is

2570
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:26,090
unaware of this there's way more way

2571
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:28,730
more letters in a group than alpha that

2572
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:30,260
than the alphabet has for streptococcus

2573
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:31,880
that's how many varieties of

2574
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:33,830
streptococcus and streptococcus is

2575
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,360
becoming superbug now it's becoming

2576
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,680
antibiotic resistant that's why

2577
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,030
everybody gets the acne that's why

2578
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:39,620
there's so many problems it's why people

2579
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:41,060
get infections why kids getting there

2580
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,920
from ear infections and you're doing the

2581
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,090
so you're doing the antibiotics and it

2582
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,590
can't get rid of the ear infection it

2583
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:47,300
keeps them coming back that's why UTIs

2584
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:50,630
urinary tract infections bladder

2585
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:52,910
infections bacterial vaginosis all of

2586
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:54,140
these things are streptococcus related

2587
01:31:52,910 --> 01:31:55,940
the reason why they don't get better

2588
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:57,440
with antibiotics or they get temporarily

2589
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:59,630
and it's on and off because it gets more

2590
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,710
resistant and there's ways of healing

2591
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:02,240
this and they talk about all the

2592
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:03,680
different conditions and chronic

2593
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,810
symptoms conditions in the book you

2594
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:09,050
should get the thyroid healing book men

2595
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:10,400
suffer from prostate cancers and and

2596
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:13,070
prostate problems because of

2597
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:14,260
epstein-barr virus and streptococcus

2598
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:16,640
something to know about

2599
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,770
epstein-barr treats prostate cancer and

2600
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:19,960
men's

2601
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:22,060
all of that breast cancer I've seen Bart

2602
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,219
causes breast cancer miscarriages

2603
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:27,040
infertility preeclampsia caused by

2604
01:32:24,219 --> 01:32:30,100
breast caused by epstein-barr buyers so

2605
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,870
miscarriages not all miscarriages don't

2606
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:34,270
get me wrong on that a lot of

2607
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:36,100
miscarriages are caused by reproductive

2608
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:37,600
issues created by epstein-barr virus a

2609
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,120
lot infertility issues not all

2610
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,710
infertility but a lot of infertility

2611
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:45,489
mysterious mysterious miscarriages

2612
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:47,010
mysterious infertility those are much of

2613
01:32:45,489 --> 01:32:50,140
those are caused by epstein-barr virus

2614
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:51,460
so there's something no preeclampsia

2615
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:53,320
that's symptoms of epstein-barr virus

2616
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,210
because the immune system drops when a

2617
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,260
woman's pregnant and so because it drops

2618
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,850
if you have a certain variety of

2619
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:59,830
epstein-barr you can get a lot of signs

2620
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:03,280
of preeclampsia and so that's really

2621
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:06,250
important to know so let's go a little

2622
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:07,690
bit further here I have look I have a

2623
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,250
whole section in thyroid healing on

2624
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:10,540
these topics really important remember

2625
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,390
there's over 60 varieties of Epstein

2626
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:15,310
Barr not just 160 varieties of pathogens

2627
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:17,380
is what it means not just one type of

2628
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:18,850
virus if you're a critic skeptic watch

2629
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:21,040
this whole thing all over again if you

2630
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:22,690
haven't seen it from the beginning make

2631
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:24,460
your own judgment call I'm totally fine

2632
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:25,750
with that critics are smart they're

2633
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:28,000
smart they know what they're saying you

2634
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,770
know haters are different but critics

2635
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,960
critics are smart intelligent people

2636
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,640
that want to learn and know and they

2637
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:35,199
want to have an open mind so make sure

2638
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:36,790
you look at this look at the book if I

2639
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,410
was a critic get the book and read it

2640
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:41,170
you don't want to pay for it go to the

2641
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:44,020
library get it out for free blaming our

2642
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:45,730
bodies on being autoimmune and our body

2643
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:47,890
attacked in itself blaming our genes

2644
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:49,900
blaming the facts the fact that we think

2645
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:51,520
we created it because of some emotional

2646
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,350
thing that's deep down inside is a

2647
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,449
really dangerous situation especially

2648
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:57,280
for young people it's kind of it's it's

2649
01:33:55,449 --> 01:33:59,860
bad enough for older people like in

2650
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,420
their fifties in 60s and 40s telling

2651
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:04,330
them that they can handle it a little

2652
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:06,370
better but telling people that are 15 16

2653
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:07,719
years old 17 years old 18 years old that

2654
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:09,989
their body is attacking itself when it's

2655
01:34:07,719 --> 01:34:13,480
not when it's an outdated theory and

2656
01:34:09,989 --> 01:34:15,670
it's really devastating beyond

2657
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:18,520
devastating telling a 15 year old that

2658
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:21,160
it's their genes is devastating when

2659
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:23,680
it's not their genes it's devastating I

2660
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,989
mean don't you think so or or do I live

2661
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,130
in a bubble it's just unbelievable

2662
01:34:25,989 --> 01:34:28,910
it's the greatest body shaming

2663
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,530
techniques I've ever seen

2664
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:31,880
by Big Pharma and it's right under

2665
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:33,560
everybody's noses and I'm the only

2666
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,910
person talking about it literally the

2667
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:36,380
only person talking about it and that

2668
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:38,630
breaks my heart alone because well

2669
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:40,820
because it's just that's how literally

2670
01:34:38,630 --> 01:34:42,500
full people are you want a body shame

2671
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:43,820
somebody tell them that their body's

2672
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,850
immune system is destroying your own

2673
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:48,680
glands when it's not when it's not the

2674
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:50,180
body's body doesn't work like that

2675
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,230
when it's a theory that was created

2676
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,270
because they didn't know what causes

2677
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:54,890
illness when autoimmune disease they

2678
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:57,200
have no they have no car they don't know

2679
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:59,180
the causes of it so just remember that

2680
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:02,060

01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,210

2835
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,460

and you're just like what's going on

2843
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:32,420
here and you quickly learn that science

2844
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:34,550
and research knows nothing about chronic

2845
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:36,260
illness science and research those

2846
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:37,820
literally nothing about chronic illness

2847
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:39,560
are the cause of chronic illness and how

2848
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:42,680

I believe in you and I believe in you

2853
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,710
100% and I realize when people aren't

2854
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:50,880
sick and those are the critics and they

2855
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,320
