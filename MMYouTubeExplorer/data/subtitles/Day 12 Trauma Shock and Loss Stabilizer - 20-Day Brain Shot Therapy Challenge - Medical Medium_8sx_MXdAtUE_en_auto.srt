1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,640
I've always wanted to do when we do that

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,859
the best of our ability but we need

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,099
something in people's hands like a

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,380
resource of some kind that can help what

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,940
happens is PTSD is a huge one when

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,900
someone goes through trauma shock or

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,060
loss

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,160
anything like that betrayal broken trust

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,619
whatever it is

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,140
PTSD can happen it can happen actually

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,539
really fast it can happen in days can

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,820
happen in weeks can happen in years but

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,560
it does happen and what I love about the

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,340
stabilizer trauma shock and loss

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,680
stabilizer is it has a punch to it to

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,020
help rewire the brain so that's what

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,579
we're doing today you guys

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,960
trauma shock and loss stabilizer for day

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,059
12 of the medical medium brain shot

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,120
therapy cleanse challenge

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,800
what happens is to rewire the brain it

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:00,180
takes more than just

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,980
mental counseling therapy right it takes

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,739
more than that because when we go

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,960
through trauma shock or loss

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,119
something physical happens to the brain

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,340
and that's something that people don't

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,140
realize out there science of research

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,600
doesn't know this

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,460
so when we go through an experience a

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,920
difficult experience

32
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,680
physically we get injured

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,400
not just emotionally so it's not just

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,380
soul and emotion and spiritual and

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
mental and mental health it's physical

36
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,500
and what happens is when there's a

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
physical injury that happens in the

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,079
brain from trauma shock or loss

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,380
we end up in a situation

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,619
where we have symptoms because of it

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,840
and then those symptoms are seen as if

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,939
the person is just emotionally unstable

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,259
so say the person goes and sees a

44
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,899
psychiatrist because they've been

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,939
through trauma shock or loss

46
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,520
psychiatrist is going to be like oh this

47
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,640
person's unstable

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,920
really no this person has an actual

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,740
physical injury inside the brain

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,560
because of the trauma shotgun laws

51
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,720
and then yes

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,739
emotional symptoms can arise from it you

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,459

94
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,340

heartbreak

100
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,220
yes

101
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,220
loneliness yes confrontation

102
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,879
all of us experience these one way or

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
another

104
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,420
somehow or some way

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,200
we get emotionally hurt have you been

106
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,079
emotionally hurt

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,079
I know I have I've been emotionally hurt

108
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,000
we get emotionally hurt

109
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,460
and the physical aspect of this goes

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,220
wholly ignored so what I was saying

111
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,979
before is when we get emotionally hurt

112
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,380
there's a physical aspect there's a

113
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:38,540
physical injury

114
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,540
something happens to us physically

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:47,660
but that's never understood totally

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,660
ignored holy ignored

117
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,479
we need to address the physical core

118
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,160
strength of our brain

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,419
so that no matter what we're

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,479
experiencing emotionally like someone

121
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,699
harming someone else emotionally

122
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,699
or what we're thinking

123
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,759
that intercourse strength of our brain

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,620
can survive emotional injuries

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,000
that's the part that people don't

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,340
realize

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,280
that we need a strong brain

128
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,680
so what medical mean information does is

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,100
it helps to support

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,960
people's brains to make them stronger

131
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,720
because

132
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,460
we're not in control of other people's

133
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,560
free will

134
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,400
other people on this planet have their

135
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,139
own free will and it doesn't stop them

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,139
from harming someone

137
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
you can still get emotional injuries

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,479
losses and hardships

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,419
we can't control all that in this world

140
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,539
but what we can control

141
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,060
is the atmosphere of our brain

142
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,060
and what we can control is the

143
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,880
environment inside our brain

144
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,460
we can control that we may not be able

145
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,960
to control the hard-hitting punches we

146
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,800
get emotionally

147
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,360
betrayal broken trust loss

148
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,900
trauma

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,400
mental abuse we may not have control

150
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:27,240
in receiving any or all of that

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,120
but we may be able to control

152
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,759
the environment inside the brain to make

153
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,840
us stronger to be a shield

154
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,840
for all of that

155
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,880
the physical aspect of this goes wholly

156
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,819
ignored we need to address the physical

157
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,259
core strength of our brain so that no

158
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,539
matter what we're experiencing

159
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,819
emotionally or what we're thinking that

160
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:54,199
inner core strength of our brain can

161
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:57,780
survive emotional injuries

162
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,860
when we have a loss or betrayal

163
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:04,139
God knows right we've all had those

164
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,300
our physical brain

165
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,580
can become injured

166
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,380
especially if our brain doesn't have

167
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,120
what it needs and that's what I love

168
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,360
about the trauma shock and loss

169
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,100
stabilizer it offers something for the

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,039
internal workings of the brain the

171
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,220
physical brain

172
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,759
part of what injures the brain is not

173
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,000
the broken trust itself

174
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,060
someone breaks the trust

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,340
and we're hurt and we feel that hurt

176
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,160
that hurt is deep

177
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,560
we're on page 76 someone just asked a

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,919
brain saver

179
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,919
I'll show you do you have this book

180
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,780
this is the brain saver book

181
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,840
part of what injures the brain is not

182
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,840
the broken trust itself right has anyone

183
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,400
broken trust

184
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:04,220
in your life

185
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,220
it's the fire that occurs

186
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:11,099
when an event like this happens

187
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,580
when trust is broken it's not the broken

188
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:17,880
trust itself that's injuring the brain

189
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,740
it's the fire that blows up inside of

190
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,319
the brain

191
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,860
that creates the injury from that broken

192
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,860
trust

193
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,620
that fire is the heating up of the brain

194
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,620
an intense electrical Heat

195
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,060
someone had it right 200 years ago when

196
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,180
they noticed that a friend needed to

197
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,279
blow off steam

198
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,140
someone had something right 300 years

199
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,100
ago when they called another person

200
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,100
hot-headed

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,480
not that someone needs to seem angry or

202
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,000
irate on the surface for the brain to

203
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,000
heat up someone

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,519
sometimes when not showing emotion the

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,820
fire inside the brain Burns hotter than

206
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,820
ever

207
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,339
you could be lying in bed hurt by

208
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:18,779
betrayal how many people do you know

209
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,640
that were lying in bed hurt by betrayal

210
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,019
you're lying in bed you're hurt by

211
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,120
betrayal you wake up in the morning

212
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,700
you're hurt by betrayal

213
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,680
betrayal's a tough one

214
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,560
I can't tell you how many knives I've

215
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,300
had to pull out of my back

216
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,060
myself

217
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,019
throughout my life it's like oh hold on

218
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,019
you guys hold on

219
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,580
hold on you guys

220
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,899
let's pull out another knife out of my

221
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,899
back

222
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,540
you could be lying in bed hurt by

223
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,720
betrayal wake up in the morning hurt by

224
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,019
betrayal not expressing a word not even

225
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,760
talking just thinking

226
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,760
feeling and remembering it

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,660
you can be hurt

228
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,580
by betrayal without realizing it and

229
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,220
you're lyingly or upset while the fire

230
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,220
burned really bright inside your brain

231
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,140
and overheating occurred you may not

232
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,140
have noticed that because it's hard to

233
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,519
know but the brain goes on fire when

234
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,140
we're betrayal and maybe you can't

235
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,920
identify that that's what it is but

236
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,920
that's what it is

237
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,440
because publicly medical research and

238
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,240
science publicly known medical research

239
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,060
in science

240
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,760
no only a tiny tiny fraction about the

241
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,420
brain in this day and age

242
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,060
this brain heating can't be measured

243
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,220
your brain heating up from betrayal

244
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,279
can't be measured your brain heating up

245
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,560
from trauma or loss or mental abuse

246
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,060
can't be measured science doesn't have a

247
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,720
way to measure it they don't even know

248
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,720
what's happening

249
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,720
if by some miraculous chance the Earth

250
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,019
is still alive one thousand years from

251
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,019
now

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,079
and not a dead rock floating along

253
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,920
we still won't know everything about the

254
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,920
human brain

255
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,500
if this Earth is still alive a thousand

256
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,079
years from now and not a dead rock with

257
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,300
no human beings on it or wildlife

258
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,300
that would be a miracle all on its own

259
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,640
Bonafide miracle for sure

260
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,100
miraculous miracle

261
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,079
but if this Earth was to still be here a

262
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,160
thousand years from now and not a dead

263
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:50,399
Rock annihilated by nuclear waste

264
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,459
annihilated by sea trails

265
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,940
annihilated by GMO food

266
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:59,220
if this Earth is still alive

267
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,380
a thousand years from now

268
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,880
medical research and science still won't

269
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,880
know everything about the brain

270
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,279
no matter how advanced science gets

271
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,459
because there's a sole aspect of the

272
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,680
brain that science will never understand

273
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,839
and it's intertwined with the rest of

274
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,220
our brain and science will never have

275
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,200
those answers

276
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,899
ever

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,360
even if this Earth is still

278
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,920
alive and breathing and the Earthly

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,920
mother is alive

280
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
even though the overheating of our

281
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,060
physical brains can't be weighed or

282
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,060
measured

283
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,420
it is just as real as the burn you get

284
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,700
from touching a hot stove

285
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,100
it's as real as spilling hot coffee in

286
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,740
your lap the heating of the brain it's

287
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,019
as real as walking barefoot across a

288
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,139
scalding parking lot to get to the beach

289
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:02,880
if you ever had that experience

290
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,040
this heating of the brain occurs

291
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,500
instantly when we experience an

292
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,920
emotional challenge of any kind it could

293
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:14,100
happen at any moment in someone's life

294
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,700
where a burning sensation we can't

295
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,279
understand mental Agony inside our brain

296
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,700
is what it amounts to

297
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,540
an IG Starlet says oh my God

298
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,540
mind-blowing

299
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,620
a heating occurs in the brain

300
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,680
that heating you may not feel like the

301
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,500
hot Touch of a stove but a mental Agony

302
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,120
is what you're feeling from the heating

303
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,380
of that brain

304
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,920
and what you're going through

305
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,920
emotionally

306
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,560
it can happen in a minute in someone's

307
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
life

308
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,959
it even happens when people are merely

309
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,160
frustrated with whatever situation is

310
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,639
before them have you ever been

311
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,579
frustrated I just frustrated

312
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,100
frustrated about anything or everything

313
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:18,720
we get heating inside the brain our

314
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,620
brain gets hot inside just from

315
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,620
frustration alone

316
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,079
the fire in our brain can burn at

317
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,200
different heat levels no matter

318
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,240
the level it burns and it can't be

319
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,320
measured by medical research and Science

320
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,320
and never will be

321
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,880
if you've ever heard of the phenomenon

322
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:48,360
of spontaneous self-combustion

323
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,940
have you ever heard of that phenomenon

324
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,240
it's actually related to this electrical

325
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,240
Heat

326
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,540
for those that don't know what that is

327
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,860
spontaneous self-combustion it's when

328
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,360
someone's just standing there and

329
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,519
everything's fine or sitting in the

330
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,800
rocking chair or sitting on their front

331
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,660
porch and all of a sudden internally

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,120
there's a fire that starts a physical

333
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,800
fire and it starts to burn all through

334
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,440
their organs until literally they're

335
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,660
nothing but Ash and their their shoes

336
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,940
are left

337
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,240
as if it was the Wicked Witch of the

338
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,399
West on The Wizard of Oz

339
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,519
we're one of the wicked witches

340
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,940
I forget I haven't seen a movie in very

341
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,940
long time

342
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,100
if you've ever heard of the phenomena on

343
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:37,260
spontaneous combustion self-combustion

344
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,800
it's actually related to this electrical

345
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:43,320
heat science research doesn't know this

346
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,699
so there's no citation in here because

347
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,079
science of research doesn't know this

348
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,519
information this is medical medium

349
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,980
information of what causes self

350
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,920
combustion

351
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,779
Reiki with Daria I've always felt the

352
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,940
overheating Sensation that I described

353
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,560
to doctors but never had anyone speak to

354
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,600
it

355
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,240
surprise surprise surprise Spirit of

356
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,440
compassion always surprises us all the

357
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,060
time

358
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,060
with just Advanced information

359
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,600
it blows my mind all the time just so

360
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,399
you know I'm just I get mind blown just

361
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,660
like anybody else who reads these books

362
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,800
and

363
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,800
learns this information

364
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,820
so we're talking about spontaneous

365
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,160
self-combustion

366
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,800
it's actually related to this electrical

367
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,100
heat science research doesn't know this

368
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,980
when there's a specific when there's a

369
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,339
very specific recipe inside someone's

370
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,060
body creating elevated ammonia levels in

371
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:41,060
the bloodstream

372
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,500
people walk around with ammonia gas

373
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,459
it's a ghost like gas that floats

374
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,459
through their bones

375
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:56,000
and drives through their bloodstream and

376
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,000
organs

377
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,420
when there's a very specific recipe

378
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,120
inside someone's body creating elevated

379
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,120
ammonia levels in the bloodstream a

380
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,600
spark off the brain's electrical grid

381
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,600
can cause combustion

382
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,699
keep in mind you need a lot going wrong

383
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,260
for spontaneous self-combustion so I

384
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,980
don't want anybody in fear about that

385
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,500
because you need a serious recipe

386
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,179
in order for spontaneous self-combustion

387
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,220
to to occur

388
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:29,880
to begin with

389
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,040
the stage is set from one putrified

390
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,320
proteins rotting inside the intestinal

391
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,900
tract and other sources of fermentation

392
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,360
in the blood from weak digestion and

393
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,980
Foods fermenting inside the gut all of

394
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,500
which adds to the ammonia in the

395
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,840
bloodstream two

396
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,600
chronic dehydration

397
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,140
meaning never enough water in the

398
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,380
bloodstream and three high blood fat

399
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,780
levels from a high fat diet then if

400
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,640
there's also continual overheating of

401
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,640
the brain from a maxed out electrical

402
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,440
grid due to brain betrayer toxins and a

403
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,559
lack of electrolytes trace minerals and

404
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,760
glucose the grid can spark and catch the

405
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,460
ammonia

406
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,799
alcohol consumption increases someone's

407
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,640
chances of self-combustion as does

408
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,640
smoking anything

409
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,520
Deborah McVeigh more mind-blowing

410
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,520
information

411
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,179
brain heat can also be an aspect of

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,460
someone feeling like Madness is taking

413
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,840
over so before I go into that I want to

414
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,620
talk about the self-combustion a little

415
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,840
bit

416
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,480
it's a rare phenomenon but if the recipe

417
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,299
is just right in a person

418
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,940
that ammonia that's in their bloodstream

419
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,460
that gas can ignite

420
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,140
and when it ignites the person Burns

421
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,140
internally from the inside out

422
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,480
brain heat can also be an aspect of

423
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,100
someone feeling like Madness is taking

424
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,440
over

425
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,080
where you almost can't stand it anymore

426
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,299
or stand yourself like Madness is taking

427
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,220
over your mind you're upset with

428
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,620
yourself or you're upset with something

429
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,720
or you're upset with someone else and it

430
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,720
feels as if Madness is taking over

431
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,360
so many people doubt themselves when

432
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,100
they're going through an emotional

433
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,460
experience do you doubt yourself when

434
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:27,000
you go through an emotional experience

435
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,000
they ask am I going crazy did you ever

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,120
ask yourself am I going crazy

437
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,760
did that ever come to your mind at all

438
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,039
did you ever ask yourself that ever at

439
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,600
any point in time

440
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,600
am I going crazy

441
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,620
you're not going crazy

442
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,100
they're experiencing intense heating of

443
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:57,000
brain tissue in an emotional center of

444
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,940
the brain eventually reaching all areas

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,220
of the brain at some point this is often

446
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,740
heightened by toxic heavy metals which

447
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,080
everybody has in their brains and other

448
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,240
chemical poisons present in the brain's

449
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,679
emotional Center so inside their

450
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,480
emotional Center they can have the

451
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,340
metals and other toxins and other

452
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,760
chemicals all in there that shouldn't be

453
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,760
in there

454
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,240
stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot

455
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Trail is one of the hottest burners

456
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:35,820
someone cheats on you that's one of the

457
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,460
hottest burn

458
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,200
someone doesn't understand you and they

459
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,840
make a decision without your permission

460
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,200
that affects your life that burns real

461
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,200
hot

462
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:52,260
loss feeling like

463
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,240
we can't get back something we lost

464
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,299
whether it's a loved one a person a

465
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,240
thing a place something we lost that

466
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:02,240
burns really hot inside our brain

467
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,059
stress loss trauma and betrayal burn hot

468
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,919
and we're not just talking about one

469
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,179
angry spell a year which still Burns hot

470
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,039
we're talking about everyday

471
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,080
frustrations too

472
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,760
for example driving to work in traffic

473
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,280
when you're late

474
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,140
slow down or stuck in a light causes the

475
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,480
brain to heat up even the slightest bit

476
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,280
it still causes it to heat up having a

477
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,260
difficult conversation can cause the

478
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,659
brain to heat up

479
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,980
participating in a virtual meeting can

480
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,360
cause the brain to heat up and that's

481
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,980
what's happening so many people are in

482
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,840
Virtual meetings these days their brain

483
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,620
heats up from just being in a virtual

484
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,280
meeting

485
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,860
because video calls often involve an

486
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,200
additional form of stress

487
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,240
whether from spotty internet connections

488
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,220
that cause delays participants talking

489
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,500
over one another or because we tend to

490
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,260
raise our voice increase facial

491
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,419
expressions or emphasize body language

492
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,820
when we feel the format isn't allowing

493
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,500
us to project our message can even raise

494
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,539
the brain's heat I'm just giving

495
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,820
examples of how the brain's heat can be

496
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:11,400
raised

497
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:14,940
Brad Danielson says what chapter is this

498
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,039
word page 77 or in the emotional brain

499
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,020
chapter of brain saver thank you for

500
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,780
asking

501
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,820
the brain heat of life's challenges is

502
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:27,179
harder on the chronically ill

503
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,220
I want to emphasize that a little bit

504
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,320
if you have a symptom or you're on

505
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:35,340
mattress island or you're struggling the

506
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,679
heat the brain heat does affect us more

507
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,240
if we're chronically sick if we're

508
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,580
struggling with a symptom or condition

509
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,620
if we're struggling with any kind of

510
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,600
diagnosis or any symptoms that are

511
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,580
holding us back

512
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,679
if we are fatigue we don't feel good

513
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,500
body aches and pains if we have brain

514
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,320
fog the brain heat does increase

515
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,179
the brain heat of life's challenges is

516
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,100
harder on The Chronic Leo science

517
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,960
research doesn't even know this

518
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,000
Nicholas Russell says where the heck

519
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,419
else can you get this kind of info

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,419
nowhere

521
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,700
I'm honored to be the messenger of this

522
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,100
information from Spirit of compassion

523
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,220
on IG there's no other place that you

524
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:22,740
can get this awesome amazing info

525
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:25,679
that's Hemi Hemi mom on IG

526
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,780
but you guys know what happens

527
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,740
bits and pieces are stolen all the time

528
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,059
never cited back we see it over here all

529
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,580
day long out there

530
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,900
from all kinds of you know gurus and

531
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,460
health professionals just taking the

532
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,380
info Non-Stop

533
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,280
it's happened to me for decades but it's

534
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,280
happening more than ever

535
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,679
and I'm just a dirty Secret

536
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,760
a dirty Secret at this point

537
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,039
for so many to get the information from

538
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,559
it's crazy

539
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:00,360
and all that does is cheat people out

540
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,340
who need the information so they can

541
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,440
heal and have a chance to save their

542
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,840
life

543
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,280
the brain heat of life's challenges is

544
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,380
harder on The Chronic allele because

545
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,299
they're often stuck in bed and people

546
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,880
don't realize when someone's chronically

547
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,880
ill and they're stuck in bed

548
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,299
how

549
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,159
it's Amplified

550
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:25,380
no one understands that when you're

551
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,600
actually illing you're actually not well

552
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,980
and you have to be couch bound or bed

553
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,320
bound a lot

554
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,419
you can't play the reindeer games that

555
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,539
everybody wants to play

556
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,220
that everybody's out there playing

557
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:39,840
you're really trying to reserve you're

558
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,240
trying to get better you're trying to

559
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,919
heal and when we go up against emotional

560
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,780
hardships or emotional struggles when

561
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,539
we're trying to heal and we're bed bound

562
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:51,179
the brain Heats even more intense and

563
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:53,580
people don't know this or realize this

564
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,320
the chronically ill or anybody who's

565
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,419
sick and struggling

566
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,780
they have more than just their symptom

567
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,280
to contend with it's not easy at all so

568
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,080
when betrayal happens when you're

569
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,600
chronically sick or any kind of hardship

570
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,580
or loss it's even more of a difficult

571
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,659
situation that's why they chronically

572
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,659
he'll have it so difficult

573
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,700
they're too fatigued to walk it off

574
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,559
you know what I hear from people know

575
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,460
what I hear from influencers out there

576
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,500
too

577
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,059
they're like well when my anxiety is up

578
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,539
I just hop on the treadmill and I run

579
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,539
for an hour

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,320
what about somebody who's a mattress

581
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,659
Island chronically ill and sick

582
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,279
and

583
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,400
and they're not at that industry

584
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,039
indestructible moment in their life

585
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,659
and they're bedridden or having problems

586
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,460
or

587
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,679
they're struggling in other ways severe

588
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,659
fatigue they can't just run off their

589
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,340
anxiety they can't just go and run for

590
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,179
an hour run off their anxiety and have

591
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,179
it all just go away

592
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,419
because they're often stuck in bed

593
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,000
they're too fatigued to walk it off

594
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,380
they're too fatigued to go exercise

595
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,480
singing sweetie says this makes so much

596
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,919
sense as to why my healing is taking so

597
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,460
long and it does it takes longer because

598
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,779
of that but it's okay it's okay but it

599
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,779
does take longer because of that

600
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,720
foreign

601
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,860
there's still plenty of Hope to recover

602
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,299
and get better it just takes a little

603
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,380
longer for so many people because of

604
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:27,240
this

605
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,580
they're too fatigued to walk it off and

606
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,320
just go exercise they're too fatigued to

607
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,539
distract themselves and run around and

608
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,520
do appointments all day and self-care

609
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:39,600
appointments all day and go out to lunch

610
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,760
at a busy restaurant and everything else

611
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,080
they can't just shake it off it's not

612
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,539
easy to shake off when you're

613
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,460
chronically sick plus if you have PTSD

614
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,559
if you're chronically sick what if you

615
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,039
got

616
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,080
lots of PTSD and OCD because you've been

617
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,240
sick too long sick for a long time

618
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,760
you've been to too many doctors too many

619
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,500
experiences with family and friends that

620
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,620
haven't been positive you've been

621
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:08,659
struggling looking for answers

622
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,659
if you just can't shake it off

623
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,400
a lot of people run from their stress

624
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,140
that's what people do they run from

625
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,760
their stress they make appointments if

626
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,980
they have the resources they go and do

627
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,240
self-care all day long they go and do

628
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,539
this they go out with their friends they

629
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,820
go out for lunches they run away from

630
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:30,360
their stress they can burn off the

631
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,840
adrenaline also called epinephrine

632
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,820
created by mild Stress and Anxiety by

633
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,260
keeping busy with activities all day

634
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,860
long

635
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,960
and wearing themselves out

636
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,360
so that the thoughts don't keep cycling

637
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,159
they get to run it off so the thoughts

638
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,080
don't recycle over and over again their

639
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,400
stress doesn't recycle they're out there

640
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,500
doing this doing that they're doing

641
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,799
whatever they're just they're staying

642
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:00,260
ahead of it right because they can

643
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:00,260
the Divine loaf says

644
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,700
and then Health gurus and influencers

645
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,299
just say you just don't have the right

646
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,299
mindset

647
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,700
foreign

648
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,740
do they ever say that and boy does that

649
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,520
get my goat

650
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,520
totally

651
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,840
people who are chronically ill don't

652
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,840
have the option

653
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:31,340
when you're stuck on your mattress

654
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,340
Island

655
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,820
you can get caught up in your headspace

656
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,840
no one understands this

657
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,880
unless you've gone through it

658
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,500
when you're stuck on mattress Island you

659
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,919
can get caught up in your head space

660
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,919
with your brain fire burning hotter

661
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,460
it's like adding insult to injury

662
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,220
because you're already dealing with the

663
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,559
physical challenges that have isolated

664
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,640
you in the first place in your life and

665
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,640
have you stuck in bed

666
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,600
you guys just so you know we're in brain

667
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,100
saver I'm now on page 78.

668
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,220
and kind of just walking you through

669
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,440
some of the information in here

670
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,460
brain heat can even burn on a different

671
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,740
level

672
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,080
with a different kind of heat when

673
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,840
everything is good and happy

674
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,539
that's because when we're having fun the

675
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,179
brain still runs hot the difference is

676
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,159
that the brain's cooling mechanisms

677
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,279
which we'll explore later are usually

678
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,679
enough to temper that type of heat

679
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,419
that said it's the reason why people

680
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,179
with chronic illness can find that

681
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,520
experiencing a little happiness is hard

682
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:52,559
on them I know people throughout the

683
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:56,580
years that were so sick that even

684
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,559
experiencing happiness was a lot

685
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,260
that was hard on them

686
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,120
even experiencing Joy was hard on them

687
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,679
because they were so sick

688
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,440
they had so many different nervous

689
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,779
system conditions the brain fog all

690
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,399
kinds of OCD all kinds of issues they're

691
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:13,500
suffering they're struggling and then

692
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,659
they get told some good news

693
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,820
and it's hard to even take in the good

694
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,059
news it's like it's it's hard because

695
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,220
it's it's intense even a little bit of

696
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,480
brain heat on good news is hard for

697
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,480
someone who's chronically ill

698
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:32,100
it's why those who are very ill in the

699
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,740
hospital can't have too many visitors

700
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,539
wishing them well on a birthday it

701
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,340
generates way too much heat in the brain

702
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:40,740
that's why someone in the hospital

703
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,919
really really sick you gotta walk in

704
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,659
quiet and everybody's walking in quiet

705
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,460
and they're trying not to say anything

706
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,740
and then when two family members are

707
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,320
arguing why the person's in bed in the

708
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,480
hospital sick someone else says hey wait

709
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,640
a minute we might not want to have an

710
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,080
argument right now why Grandma's sitting

711
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,020
in the bed

712
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,760
are laying in the bed in the hospital

713
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,760
or anybody not even Grandma whatever

714
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,740
Andrea says did anybody

715
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,120
got the name of the book please brain

716
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,419
what

717
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,760
brain saver and brain saver protocols

718
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:20,880
that's one book they're just splitting

719
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:25,020
after two over 600 page Bibles right

720
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,679
here I'm on page 76 78 lost that one 78

721
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,679
a brain saver

722
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,679
foreign

723
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,679
so let's go a little bit more and this

724
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,000
is really cool good information right

725
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,340
here

726
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,059
I've known people who say oh whoa this

727
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,059
is really good too

728
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,539
even when we're not ill the brain heat

729
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,940
that happens generates can be exhausting

730
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,279
I've known people who say they love

731
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,919
every part of putting together a dinner

732
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,100
party and have an amazing time talking

733
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,500
all night and then feel completely wiped

734
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:09,539
out and exhausted the next day if you

735
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,059
ask them if they wanted to do it all

736
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:14,760
over again the next day they would feel

737
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:17,399
reluctant they put on a big dinner party

738
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,220
they're not sick they worked really hard

739
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:21,539
they entertained 50 people came rolling

740
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,820
into their house

741
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,940
right they had a huge dinner party

742
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,820
that's because the brain ran hot from

743
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,860
all the fun you can get burnt out from

744
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,380
too much fun there are people in the

745
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,559
world who have the means to play all

746
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,480
they want they're loaded with cash they

747
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,399
can play and do anything they can go

748
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,059
anywhere they want and they end up

749
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:48,840
needing vacations from their vacations

750
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:51,179
I know a lot of wealthy people

751
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,100
out there in the world

752
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,539
personally I know a lot of wealthy

753
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,820
people out there

754
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,740
and what I find

755
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,960
from the wealthy people that I know out

756
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,320
there in the world

757
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,240
is that they vacation a lot

758
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,080
like a lot

759
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,260
they're traveling all around the world

760
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,740
they're on boats they're on yachts

761
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,779
they're on planes constantly

762
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,460
traveling overseas

763
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,559
they're here they're there they're

764
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,539
skiing down here they're up here now

765
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,179
they're in Aspen now they're in Germany

766
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:29,880
though whatever they're in Switzerland I

767
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,620
know a lot of wealthy people and they

768
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,899
play a lot

769
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,019
but they have to take vacations after

770
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,380
they play a lot their lives their lives

771
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:42,659
are almost permanently vacationed

772
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,360
because they're playing so much because

773
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:47,100
they have the wealth to do it

774
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,100
that they need to take vacations

775
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,100
constantly

776
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:57,679
I usually say to me aw why don't you

777
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,679
take a vacation and I'm too busy working

778
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,840
I haven't taken a vacation ever

779
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:05,700
I'm too busy working

780
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,679
and they're always like I don't

781
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,839
understand that I don't understand that

782
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,820
I go don't worry you take another

783
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,300
vacation

784
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,399
because that's what people do right

785
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,020
they need vacations from their vacations

786
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,520
from their vacations from their

787
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,099
vacations

788
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,859
or they need chill time for days

789
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:29,099
afterwards a chance to do nothing at all

790
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:31,500
and increase self-care protocols lots of

791
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:32,580
massages lots of massages to recover for

792
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,460
many of the excitement from their

793
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,980
vacations they need massages when they

794
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,859
come home from their vacations

795
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,020
they had a fabulous trip which was

796
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,899
intended to be self-care to begin with

797
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,399
in the first place no matter who you are

798
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,320
and how lucky you are in life you still

799
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,060
have to protect your brain is what I'm

800
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,099
saying even from people who are having

801
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,179
fun all the time still have to protect

802
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,460
their brain

803
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,359
on IG

804
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,460
see Visa Hill says the fact that he's

805
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,740
not charging us for this info should

806
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,660
tell people that he's the real deal and

807
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,700
really cares about helping others can I

808
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,500
just add something to that

809
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,420
can I add this the medical meeting

810
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,460
podcast in apple podcast doesn't have

811
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,740
commercials or advertisers

812
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,119
and it's a top podcast in the world of

813
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,500
Health

814
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,020
and it's the only one with no

815
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,599
advertisers or advertisements on it or

816
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,520
commercials

817
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,980
that means it's a free podcast to listen

818
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,320
to free from the burden of your ear

819
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,540
having to be sold stuff all the time

820
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,280
when you go listen to a podcast

821
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,800
and it makes me no money because I don't

822
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,460
have advertisers in front of my podcast

823
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,680
I could charge thousands per person

824
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,720
for like a huge program or something

825
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,820
like that to hand out this unique

826
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,099
information I can box up all the books

827
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,440
keep it away from the world I could put

828
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,060
subscription fees all over my website I

829
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,380

849
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:39,200
I did a free light blast

850
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,540
and I'm happy to do so

851
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,359
but you need to be on the newsletter

852
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,240
and I'm not complaining or anything but

853
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,200
all this stuff running a website like

854
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,260
that

855
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,700
and the amount of team that you need and

856
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,560
the amount of costs are insane and I put

857
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,940
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

858
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,540
upon thousand upon thousands of dollars

859
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,540
into it all

860
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,579
blah blah blah

861
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,200
so I want to talk a little bit more

862
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
about

863
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,200
um

864
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,140
the solution here isn't to stop yourself

865
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,720
from having emotions we don't have total

866
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:27,079
control over that anyway we can make

867
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,940
what feels to be a lot of progress

868
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:32,220
emotionally with conquering demons we

869
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,920
can move mountains in our emotional

870
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:37,800
state and that does not mean we will

871
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,900
stop having emotions I don't care what

872
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,300
anybody says

873
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,520
they're still going to have emotions

874
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,839
I don't care what Guru says they control

875
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,040
their emotions they're still going to

876
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,740
have emotions

877
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,980
no one on this planet

878
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:55,500
is emotionless

879
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,660
no one

880
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,119
life is not a definitive mapped out

881
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,520
journey we know that our life is not

882
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,400
somebody else's life

883
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,579
yet if you look at the lives of others

884
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,339
they can seem to have a good run of it

885
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:14,760
for a little while and when we can think

886
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:18,839
they have life figured out slowly

887
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,940
their best life moments in public

888
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:23,520
behind the scenes they're running into

889
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,740
emotional quicksand so I'm not reading

890
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,420
this so great right here I'm bouncing

891
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,680
around what I'm trying to say is people

892
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,480
can seem like they got their

893
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,820
together totally together everything

894
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,440
solid as a rock but behind the scenes

895
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,200
they're running into emotional quicksand

896
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,720
more than we know you can see it on IG

897
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,180
you can see it in Social everywhere

898
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,480
people they have a different thing going

899
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,520
on for the public eye right influencers

900
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,920
have a different thing going on behind

901
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,140
the scenes their life's a mess

902
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,820
you scratch the surface

903
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,540
and it's pretty bad

904
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,820
but what they show

905
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,260
on social all the time is a different

906
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,839
picture

907
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,099
but what's behind it all isn't really

908
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,820
what's happening

909
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:07,820
in front

910
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,839
what you don't know that's happening is

911
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,000
behind the scenes they're in another bad

912
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:16,680
relationship you wouldn't know they're

913
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,940
not going to talk about that part on IG

914
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,260
or social

915
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,460
they're not going to talk about that on

916
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,839
YouTube that they're in another bad

917
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,300
relationship

918
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,320
they're going to keep that quiet in the

919
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,119
back

920
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
or they're experiencing another friend

921
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,180
betrayal they're not they're going to

922
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,520
keep that quiet in the back too and when

923
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,220
they're doing their thing on social

924
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,780
another career Downer and they're not

925
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,800
going to talk about that on social but

926
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,839
they're going to make it look like on

927
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,980
social debt their career is booming and

928
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,020
incredible

929
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:47,820
but you scratch a surface underneath it

930
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:49,859
all their career isn't booming actually

931
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,599
they make it look like it's booming on

932
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:54,180
social they make it look like the

933
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,280
relationship's going great on social but

934
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,540
behind the scenes there's problems and

935
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,020
they're going through a lot of emotional

936
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,020
turmoil

937
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,339
they feel like they're drowning again

938
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,980
stuck at a bad Halloween party again

939
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:11,460
falling off the horse again emotionally

940
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:14,460
poisoned again we just don't know it

941
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,920
you don't know it

942
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:19,079
some people do go for a little while

943
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,720
without being challenged

944
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:23,940
it's true without too much turmoil

945
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,700
sometimes many years before a big

946
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,980
divorce happens or a big life upset

947
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,320
happens before they get trapped in

948
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,599
emotional quicksand again

949
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,099
others have shorter stints of what feels

950
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,880
like emotional freedom and progress

951
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:42,720
either way eventually adversity comes

952
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:47,240
adversity comes it just does Christina

953
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,240
Brad says I feel so validated on YouTube

954
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,200
and adversity becomes your greatest

955
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,560
adversary if we don't know what is

956
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,980
happening inside our emotional brains

957
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,839
in any moment of time if we don't have

958
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,180
our brain protected

959
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,820
the heating that can occur can set us

960
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,619
back these setbacks can feel very

961
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,359
confusing when we believe we're taking

962
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,940
the right steps to our emotional and

963
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,500
physical health little did we know these

964
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,079
steps might not have been the most

965
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,480
appropriate to sustain itself during an

966
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,420
emotional storm no matter how many

967
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,880
meditations someone has done or what

968
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,800
they've conquered emotionally if they're

969
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,780
not taking care of their brain and

970
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,640
dealing with their brain heat correctly

971
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,099
they're not protecting their brain so

972
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,900
what I'm saying is

973
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:35,400
we have to protect our brain because

974
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,320
we're not going to be able to stop a lot

975
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,820
of hardships that come our way or other

976
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,260
things because other people have their

977
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,940
own free will when you're in a

978
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,800
relationship the other person has their

979
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,440
own free will

980
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,900
they're not beholden to you even though

981
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,119
it seems like it's like that

982
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,119
they still have their own free will

983
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,920
another person in another relationship

984
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,140
they have their own free will and what

985
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,560
that means is

986
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,740
something could go wrong at some point

987
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,740
foreign

988
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,099
we can't get worn down by the little ups

989
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,020
and downs and challenges thrown our way

990
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:18,660
we can get worn down by the larger

991
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,720
challenges that come along every so many

992
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,839
years whatever life brings whenever it

993
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,060
brings them our brains burn hot

994
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,160
being prepared ahead of time is the

995
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,660
ultimate defense and protection for our

996
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,640
brain and that's what the brain saver

997
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,040
books are about and that's what medical

998
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,540
medium information is about protecting

999
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,460
the brain where the soul is just

1000
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,040
protecting us

1001
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,200
it allows us to preserve persevere

1002
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,300
through any kind of emotional hit or

1003
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,740
pain or even overwhelming joy we

1004
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,839
experience

1005
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,700
when it comes down to it being aware of

1006
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,740
our emotional brains is not about

1007
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,839
avoiding life's ups and downs because

1008
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,579
whether we like it or not something does

1009
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,660
happen it happens to me it happens to

1010
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:02,520
everybody we all have something that

1011
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,560
makes us emotional

1012
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,359
it's about learning how to cool the

1013
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,720
brain and keep it

1014
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,180
safe and from being scorched

1015
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,420
guys the information is just incredible

1016
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,420
here

1017
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,020
Cold Light spring says I feel stronger

1018
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,359
with the brain shots we're doing the

1019
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:26,720
trauma shock and loss stabilizer today

1020
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:28,980
this is day 12 medic mean brain shot

1021
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,079
therapy cleanse challenge I'm excited

1022
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,339
about this you guys what you see is some

1023
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,859
ingredients in front of me we've got

1024
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,020
apples we've got spinach and we got

1025
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:39,540
cherries which I'm excited about those

1026
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,760
are frozen cherries that defrost it

1027
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:46,760
and we're going to make the trauma shock

1028
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,760
and loss stabilizer very excited

1029
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,619
meditation isn't going to stop someone

1030
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,619
else

1031
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,560
from dying

1032
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:02,119
getting caught in an accident

1033
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,119
it's not going to stop a breakup

1034
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,420
it's not going to stop what happens

1035
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,040
physically to the brain when we have

1036
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:10,200
betrayal

1037
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,740
because the brain has to be able to

1038
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,200
withstand the Heat

1039
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,579
foreign

1040
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,260
books have a lot of meditations in them

1041
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:21,060
I mean medical being podcasts at Apple

1042
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,800
podcast incredible meditations from

1043
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,280
Spirit of compassion that help rewire

1044
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,280
the brain

1045
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,440
but we still have to protect our brain

1046
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:34,859
so when it gets hot

1047
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,619
that it has enough Reserves

1048
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:41,220
so that's something to keep in mind

1049
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:42,839
there are physical things we need to do

1050
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,040
for our brain the right amount of

1051
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:46,140
glucose the right amount of Trace

1052
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,700
mineral salts all of that

1053
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,280
and

1054
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,440
medical meme information is about how we

1055
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,260
can actually fortify

1056
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,420
restore and actually keep the brain

1057
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,160
strong

1058
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,480
Mark crossy says your information is

1059
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,480
restoring my health Anthony

1060
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,500
Adam

1061
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:12,780
says I did the one yesterday when I got

1062
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,119
some difficult financial news

1063
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,640
it helped me so much these shots work

1064
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,160
like magic thank you so much aw and sfc

1065
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,440
love you so much

1066
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,500
how and why does the brain even heat up

1067
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,579
what does the what does the heat do bad

1068
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,520
or good

1069
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:32,160
well the bad is that the heat kills

1070
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,140
brain cells and we all know that we

1071
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,020
don't want to lose brain cells at a

1072
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,760
rapid Pace the cleaner the brain cell is

1073
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,800
the greater ability for the brain cell

1074
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,260
to stay alive under Heat

1075
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,480
it takes hotter and more sustained heat

1076
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,520
levels to destroy brain cells when the

1077
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,079
brain cell is clean okay so what that

1078
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,300
means right here

1079
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,000
is if our brain is filled with toxins

1080
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,220
and chemicals and metals and too much of

1081
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,200
that the brain cells get hotter the

1082
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,200
brain gets hotter that means the brain

1083
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,560
cells die easier that's why someone with

1084
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,660
Alzheimer's their brain is dying why is

1085
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,400
their brain dying because they have a

1086
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,440
high level of toxic heavy metals in

1087
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
their brain that's mm info

1088
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,819
because the person with Alzheimer's has

1089
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,579
toxic heavy metals in the brain causing

1090
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:20,099
their their Alzheimer's the brain gets

1091
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:22,560
hotter and hotter more brain cells die

1092
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:24,359
faster and faster to the point where

1093
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,099
brain tissue dies and then the person

1094
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:30,140
with Alzheimer's can't catch up they

1095
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,140
can't get past it they can't beat it

1096
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,460
the cleaner the brain cell is the

1097
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,960
greater ability for the brain cell to

1098
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,819
stay alive under heat that's why it's

1099
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,680
critical to clean the brain cells and

1100
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:42,720
that's what we're talking about

1101
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,400
it takes hotter and more sustained heat

1102
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,280
levels to destroy a brain cell when it's

1103
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,020
clean when a brain cell is dirty filled

1104
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,819
with everyday toxins and toxic heavy

1105
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,040
metals the brain cell heats up more

1106
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:54,359
quickly and stays hot longer so what

1107
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,880
happens is like somebody with

1108
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:57,900
Alzheimer's or dementia is just one

1109
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,480
example

1110
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,819
the brain has so much toxic matter in it

1111
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,040
that when the brain heats up it stays

1112
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:06,780
hot longer Burns and kills brain cells

1113
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,359
longer

1114
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,339
more toxins make the brain cell more

1115
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,319
conductive to heat plus toxins coat the

1116
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:15,599
brain cells inner cell membranes not

1117
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:17,640
allowing heat to escape if a brain cell

1118
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,040
doesn't die the heat can render the

1119
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,880
dirty brain cell out of service

1120
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,880
people walk around with brain cells that

1121
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,640
are where the light is out

1122
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,760
the light is out in the brain cell

1123
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:35,160
it's out of service the brain cell does

1124
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,800
not respond with electricity

1125
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,599
electricity inside the brain it's out

1126
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,880
the lights are out

1127
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,220
a clean brain cell can release heat more

1128
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,599
easily through its cell wall a dirty one

1129
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,640
can

1130
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,560
that said extended heating over a period

1131
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,540
of time can still render clean brain

1132
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,819
cells temporarily disabled too if we're

1133
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,400
up against a lot of problems forcing it

1134
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:58,500
to Slumber into dormancy which happens

1135
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,140
to a lot of people

1136
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,720
many times when someone is under extreme

1137
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,579
stress or emotional distress that

1138
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,040
opportunity for brain cells to restore

1139
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,540
doesn't come it's why someone who's

1140
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,339
going through a difficult relationship

1141
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,800
with constant fighting or emotional

1142
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:16,440
abuse May reach out to an old friend for

1143
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,819
help saying it feels like what I'm going

1144
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,819
through is killing me

1145
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,579
when someone's going through emotional

1146
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,819
torment emotional abuse a difficult

1147
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:32,520
situation a difficult relationship

1148
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:36,000
and they tell a friend

1149
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,520
often what they say is

1150
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,700
this is killing me

1151
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,700
this relationship is killing me this

1152
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:47,300
arguing and fighting is killing me I'm

1153
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,300
dying

1154
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,440
because what they feel like they're

1155
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:55,140
going through is killing them

1156
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,060
that they feel like they're dying these

1157
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:00,119
messages aren't just about a soul injury

1158
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,460
someone experiencing from a cycle of

1159
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,220
abuse or a roller coaster ride painful

1160
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,260
relationship of ups and downs this

1161
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,599
person is experiencing brain cells

1162
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,579
themselves shutting down brain cells

1163
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,619
actually shutting down going into

1164
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:16,099
dormancy with some brain cells even

1165
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,099
dying

1166
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,839
brain cell dormancy and death aren't all

1167
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,300
that happens when the brain heats up

1168
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,400
there's also a diminishing of beneficial

1169
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,280
brain chemicals like neurotransmitter

1170
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,960
chemicals hormones including the

1171
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,880
hundreds of thousands of important brain

1172
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,859
functioning chemicals that surge through

1173
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,020
our brain and remain undiscovered and

1174
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:39,020
undocumented by research in science

1175
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,680
Health with Liz what's up a debut in

1176
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:47,760
spirit I I felt so seen when I read this

1177
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,740
chapter

1178
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:53,280
I used to suffer from that brain heat

1179
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,740
due to metals and other toxins that I

1180
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,920
suffered so much from it I couldn't even

1181
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:01,680
find peace at the beach

1182
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,380
that's a powerful comment Liz and I have

1183
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,520
to just say something about that

1184
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:10,800
where like you guys what Liz is saying

1185
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,480
is so powerful and one of the things

1186
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,940
that's really powerful about it is that

1187
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,599
she couldn't find peace at the beach

1188
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,980
that means when she went out of her

1189
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,400
house

1190
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:26,220
to try to have some type of peace and

1191
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,060
joy and then went to a beach to sit

1192
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,520
there

1193
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:31,560
she was in agony

1194
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,060
and other people don't understand this

1195
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,640
out there I mean maybe you guys because

1196
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,260
you might experience that but what's

1197
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,119
happening here is that other people in

1198
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,560
the world who have an experience that

1199
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,940
don't know what that is they don't know

1200
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,800
they think that you should be on the

1201
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,740
beach no matter what and you're fine you

1202
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:49,260
look fine everything should be good but

1203
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:51,900
instead like

1204
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,579
being on the beach and still suffering

1205
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,900
when you're supposed to be having fun

1206
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:56,520
right

1207
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,920
it's just really difficult educating

1208
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,079
myself says that's why we're all

1209
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,119
brainwashed

1210
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,040
I think that's what I saw life coaching

1211
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:08,960
nurse Kim said these brain shots feel

1212
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,960
like they're really cool to my brain

1213
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,460
these chemicals get utilized burned up

1214
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,260
so what I'm saying here in in brain

1215
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:21,240
saver is that

1216
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,220
the good stuff in our brain gets used up

1217
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:26,000
and burned up really fast

1218
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:29,460
when we're up against betrayal anything

1219
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,260
relationships difficult situations if

1220
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,140
our brain is dirty filled with metals

1221
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,079
and toxins all of it

1222
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:39,780
and IG I have been totally there Liz I

1223
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,520
am better after four years of mm Earth

1224
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,579
humor said that

1225
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,619
and then M Campbell said happens to me

1226
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:50,780
in the beach as well

1227
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:50,780
Carol says I experienced that too

1228
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,260
then there are some brain chemicals that

1229
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,300
are there for other reasons of your

1230
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:00,780
well-being and when the brain gets hot

1231
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,220
these special types of chemicals make it

1232
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:04,260
hotter for example the chemical

1233
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,260
compounds of the brain involved with

1234
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:09,480
passion and creativity

1235
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,880
someone has a lot of passion and a lot

1236
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,720
of creativity and their brain is filled

1237
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:17,819
with a lot of toxins and poisons

1238
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,640
whoa the brain can just burn

1239
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:22,740
these are invaluable brain chemicals

1240
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,660
the ones that are behind creativity and

1241
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,760
passion that can help us create and get

1242
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:28,020
inspired express ourselves but when

1243
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,640
we're suffering and we're sick with

1244
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,559
chronic illness we feel like we're dead

1245
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,240
inside

1246
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,220
when we're suffering we're sick with

1247
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,339
chronic illness our passion and our

1248
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:39,660
creativity gets hindered

1249
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:42,720
that's what it feels like for a lot of

1250
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:44,640
people this electrical grid of our brain

1251
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,800
should not be controlled when it comes

1252
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,900
to creativity so these chemicals run

1253
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,059
hotter and our brain ignites and lights

1254
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,980
up because that's something special that

1255
00:52:51,059 --> 00:52:55,079
we have inside

1256
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,660
and explores the benefit of our growth

1257
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,079
this knowledge also explains what's

1258
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:03,660
behind creative blocks when we feel we

1259
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:06,599
have a block what does this create a

1260
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:09,900
block I have why am I stuck

1261
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,940
because of all the toxins

1262
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:14,339
blocking

1263
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,980
our creativity interfering with the

1264
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:18,720
creativity chemicals that are good but

1265
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,180
right now yes it's true it doesn't

1266
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,280
matter where you are in fact it's even

1267
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,339
worse when you're somewhere nice and

1268
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,859
still feel bad exactly Lorraine

1269
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:31,020
by the way on YouTube comment Lorraine

1270
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:33,000
you left a comment and you put a a time

1271
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,920
time stamp on yesterday's YouTube was

1272
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,440
pretty funny and I hit the time stamp to

1273
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,119
see what part you were talking about

1274
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,660
it was a part where I was cracking up

1275
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,660
about stuff

1276
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,960
I thought that was actually funny

1277
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:55,140
Elvis lives had a rough rough month my

1278
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:58,700
creativity songwriting passion went away

1279
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,700
you were so right Anthony

1280
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,780
foreign offering relief is more than

1281
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,800
just trying to offer someone emotional

1282
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,800
comfort

1283
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,619
if someone even has that privilege or

1284
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:19,020
opportunity to receive solace

1285
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:22,020
many people don't have someone reaching

1286
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:25,559
out and offering comfort

1287
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:27,839
they feel they're in it alone

1288
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,760
so many people feel like they're in it

1289
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,500
alone and that they don't have a lot of

1290
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,940
people reaching out to them or anybody

1291
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,920
reaching out to them to offer them

1292
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,800
Solace or Comfort they feel like they're

1293
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,559
just in it alone

1294
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,599
and even if someone does reach out a

1295
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,220
hand and tells them that everything is

1296
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,900
going to be okay

1297
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,880
doesn't mean they're going to feel that

1298
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,040
comfort

1299
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,960
on Rumble

1300
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,980
see

1301
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,940
JK says I can relate I hurt everywhere I

1302
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:01,520
go

1303
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,520
I go this all explains a lot

1304
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:07,680
if I butcher any of your comments just

1305
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:10,500
just forgive me

1306
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,040
or if I butcher any of your handles just

1307
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,040
forgive me

1308
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:16,520
I'm not a scholar

1309
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:21,240
SOC

1310
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:25,740
has the information on messenger

1311
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:28,140
I try to message the best I can

1312
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,240
over here verbally doesn't mean they're

1313
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,920
going to feel the Comfort even when

1314
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,480
they're getting Comfort they can still

1315
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,040
feel like they're alone

1316
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:40,260
when we're in the fire of hurt

1317
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,579
betrayal and anger and distress were in

1318
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,579
the thick of it

1319
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:46,440
we've been let down our brain may be so

1320
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:48,180
physically compromised by the heat of

1321
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,619
emotional fire that we're not able to

1322
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,619
see through it with our own eyes

1323
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,220
can't even see through the smoke it's

1324
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:59,400
hard

1325
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:03,059
here's a part that's really important

1326
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,460
you're not a bad person

1327
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:07,920
if we break robot status and express

1328
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:11,040
emotions such as anger frustration or

1329
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,540
pain we can feel that we come across as

1330
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,300
weak

1331
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:19,440
the self-help out there tends to lean on

1332
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:21,660
the side let's change you as a person

1333
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,059
maybe you have some faults

1334
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,619
that we're allowing maybe you have some

1335
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:28,020
faults that are causing these emotions

1336
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:30,119
to happen we can make you a better

1337
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,280
person to self-help out there always

1338
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:33,660
folks focuses on you're really a bad

1339
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,280
person and we're going to make you a

1340
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,900
better person

1341
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,280
since science research doesn't know

1342
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,020
what's wrong with you and no one else

1343
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,940
knows what's wrong with you you

1344
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,760
obviously have just some mental problems

1345
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:46,800
so you need to work on yourself because

1346
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,900
you're the fault you're the faulty

1347
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,819
person you're a bad person so let's

1348
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,680
change you as a person

1349
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:54,680
since you're so bad as a person

1350
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,859
we can make you a better person this

1351
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,839
type of self-help tends to point out

1352
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,640
your flaws and imply you're a bad person

1353
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,960
everybody's got flaws I got flaws

1354
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,760
everybody does

1355
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,780
even if it doesn't imply you're a bad

1356
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,640
person it's an approach it's an approach

1357
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,680
that about learning not to react

1358
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,180
learning to think logically learning to

1359
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,099
meditate to control your emotions

1360
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,800
because you can't control the outside

1361
00:57:17,099 --> 00:57:21,300
world so you can control yourself this

1362
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,660
still doesn't address what's physically

1363
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,660
wrong

1364
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,980
self-improvement

1365
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:34,260
blames us

1366
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,819
as if we're the bad person or the faulty

1367
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,180
person we just don't know how to control

1368
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:38,180
it

1369
00:57:38,579 --> 00:57:43,079
but really

1370
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,000
no one realized it realizes it in the

1371
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:46,680
self-improvement world

1372
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,480
that there's really something going on

1373
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,119
we've been really hurt and it happened

1374
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,280
physically not just emotionally

1375
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,220
and we're struggling

1376
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,140
and we're not a bad person it's not your

1377
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:00,000
fault you didn't even cause your problem

1378
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:03,680
you were hurt

1379
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,680
so why am I being blamed

1380
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,079
for not handling it right

1381
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,359
any approach that says you're the

1382
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,400
problem can knock a person down slightly

1383
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,819
injure them on top of what they're

1384
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:23,220
already going through in that hard time

1385
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:24,420
so here you are you're hurt emotionally

1386
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,099
physically

1387
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,359
you've been through hell and back and

1388
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:29,880
then someone tells you you're not

1389
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,740
handling it right you're the problem

1390
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,420
it can make them feel like they can't

1391
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:35,339
handle their emotions you can't handle

1392
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,380
their emotions

1393
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:38,880
it can even make them feel like they're

1394
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,799
creating their emotional reactions

1395
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,440
you're creating your emotional reactions

1396
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:46,319
what's never part of the self what's

1397
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:48,599
never part of this self-help equation is

1398
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,579
telling people that there are toxic

1399
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:52,559
substances in their brain they've been

1400
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:55,619
poisoned physically

1401
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,520
on a physical level that's interfering

1402
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,520
with their fire

1403
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,980
they've been hurt this should be the

1404
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,980
main headline

1405
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:10,559

live on

1417
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,780
then I tried the moon meditation and

1418

1428
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,480

1523
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:36,780
on the lemon balm this is critical for

1524
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,980
me in my life I'm just saying it is a

1525
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,859
commentive

lemon balm shock therapy in the brain

1545
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,720
saver protocols by the way

1546
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:40,980
I just gave doc a doctor friend some

1547
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:42,480
advice about because the doctor friend

1548
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:44,640
asked me about the lemon balm and how to

1549
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,099
use it with patience and I said it

1550
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:50,299
curves the brain heat that's what I was

1551
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:50,299
telling a doctor friend anyway

1552
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,740
all right so I'm going to drop some

1553
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,980
cherries down in here if you guys don't

1554
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,980

1555
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:03,380

1556
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:11,520
so good

1557
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:13,440
these are frozen cherries by the way I

1558
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,680
defrosted them

1559
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:18,680
okay one cup tightly packed spinach next

1560
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,579
drop some spinach in here I got spinach

1561
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,920
on both sides of the cherries there

1562
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:29,220
let's go

1563
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:32,880
oh I love this Trace mineral salts in

1564
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,500
the spinach are really incredible too

1565
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,240
coupled with

1566
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,240
the glucose from the cherries

1567
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:45,240
so one cup tightly packed spinach so I

1568
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:47,960
still got a little bit more to go

1569
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,960
there we are

1570
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:52,760

1571
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:59,299

1577
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,180
I'm excited about

1578
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,079
boom

1579
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:30,240
so what I love about the trauma shock

1580
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:32,819
and loss stabilizer is it happens to

1581
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:35,160
tastes good and I can't say that for

1582
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:37,859
every one of these brain shots because

1583
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:40,260
Spirit of compassion wasn't thinking

1584
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:42,839
about making the brain shot taste good

1585
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,940
good sort of compassion wanted the brain

1586
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:47,880
shot to actually work

1587
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,799
that was the key and if for some reason

1588
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:52,020
the right synergistic combination

1589
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,880
happened also taste good at the same

1590
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,920
time then fantastic

1591
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,619
that would be incredible

1592
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,480
and I happen to like this one because it

1593
01:07:58,619 --> 01:08:02,700
tastes good and that's what I love about

1594
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,039
it

1595
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:07,920

01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:52,860
she's getting a lot of mental abuse from

1674
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:55,500
Dr Nesbitt lately because

1675
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:58,460
of all his bad habits

1676
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,460
uh Beatrice

1677
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:07,260
so yeah anyway Dr Nesbitt

1678
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:09,659
um leaves the TV on all night long

1679
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:12,060
and Beatrice can't sleep

1680
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:14,219
because the television is on all night

1681
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:19,199
long Dr Nesbitt that's not a good idea

1682
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:21,900
that's not helping anything Dr Nesbitt

1683
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:25,040
um brings his bloody scrubs into the

1684
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:28,800
house and Beatrice was making a salad

1685
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:31,320
for Dr Nesbitt

1686
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,659
yeah Beatrice is making a sound for Dr

1687
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:36,000
Nesbitt and Dr Nesbitt got somebody's

1688
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:38,640
blood

1689
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,739
in the salad when he was taking off his

1690
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:44,400
scrubs

1691
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:46,980
Dr Nesbitt said it was

1692
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,420
it's true it was blood from a surgery he

1693
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,280
was doing

1694
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:52,980
be interested and appreciate the blood

1695
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,460
on her salad so she had to make a whole

1696
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:55,460
new salad

1697
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,460
and when she made the whole new salad Dr

1698
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,219
Nesbitt chose not to eat it he went

1699
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,140
straight to his whiskey and did not have

1700
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:09,719
a salad

1701
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:12,659
Dr Nesbitt says his Beatrice makes his

1702
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:16,260
brain heat get real gets really bad

1703
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:19,199
and Beatrice doesn't appreciate that

1704
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:20,820
Elizabeth says his brain he got so bad

1705
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:22,500
from Beatrice that his brain almost

1706
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,840
exploded he said

1707
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:26,460
and that is not a good thing to say Dr

1708
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,800
Nesbitt how dare you say that about

1709
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,140
Beatrice

1710
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,080
Mitra said

1711
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:35,460
it's not true Dr nesbit's the one that

1712
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,960
causes all the trouble in the

1713
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:40,500
relationships

1714
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,699
uh that the relationship issues they

1715
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:45,060
have

1716
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:48,420
Dr Nesbitt said

1717
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:50,640
now when Beatrice nags him

1718
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,500
he feels like

1719
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,780
he the only thing that cools down his

1720
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,040
brain is an extra shot of whiskey at

1721
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,900
night

1722
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,840
I don't know what to do about these two

1723
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:03,659
I really can't I can't help them what

1724
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,920

1725
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:07,320

1726
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,600

01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:11,940
something her brain Heats Rising right

1728
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,860

1730
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:21,060
and takes them out to the bars at night

1731
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,860
