00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,519
Health

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,599
Information that's years ahead of where

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,000
science and medical research is now and

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,400

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,279
for information too I hear it all the

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,160
time I hear it all the time what people

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,960
go through and how many years they have

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,880
to wait and you to get to get results

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,439
and everything else you know you have to

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,840
know I want everybody to know the

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,840
information here doesn't come from

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,360
interest groups medical funding with

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,440
strings attached botched research

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,440
lobbyists internal Kickbacks persuaded

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,440
belief systems private panels of

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,079
influencers and health field payoffs or

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,199
trendy traps the information health

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,760
information that spirit and I are

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,199
bringing to you that I share comes from

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,120
a pure untampered with Advanced Clean

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,039
Source a higher source the spirit Spirit

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,239
of compassion there's nothing more

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,680
healing than

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,159
compassion and you know when you think

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,720
about it well hey wait a minute you must

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,640
be just talking about conventional

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,159
medicine no I'm talking about

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,720
alternative too all the things I just

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
mentioned Kickbacks persuaded belief

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,920
systems private panel of influencers to

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,720
make the thumb on the scale go a certain

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,560
direction because investors and money

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,520
invested into something you guys have to

37
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,920
know something about both alternative

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,479
and people think it's all conventional

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
meaning conventional is where all the

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,680
sour the sour stuff happens that's what

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,240
everybody says actually that's not true

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,920
I'm sorry to say it's painstaking it's

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,719
painstaking that say this but it's

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,600
alternative too because when someone's

45
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,079
invested and a group is invested to get

46
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,880
an outcome through science and research

47
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,159
the thumb is put on the scale in most of

48
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,960
the cases because the money is going to

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,479
be lost people are going to be really

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,680
really angry funding's not going to

51
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,479
occur again and so things have to kind

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,440
of get persuaded one way or another I'm

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,160
telling you this because guess what the

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,720
information that's here doesn't hold

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,760
that contamination attached to it

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
because that's what happens and you know

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,959
there I I see it out there I see

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
information in the health realm both

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,800
conventional and alternative and it it's

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,920
got contamination to it because there's

61
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,680
something going on with it that's you

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,160
know going a certain Direction because

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,840
of these reasons that's not going to

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
happen here I've refused to let it

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,000
happen here the information you're

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,840

133
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
and then the person said to me well you

134
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,560
know normally when people put books

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,840
together they're usually just kind of

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,680
like the ideas there it's in the book

137
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,440
The Concept is there the idea is there

138
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,199
and that's great but usually when they

139
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,600
go talking on their podcast or radio

140
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,120

146
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,080
different facets and pieces of fabric

147
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,440

I've mentioned and have gone in and out

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,000

167
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,639
its own and we have a lot of different

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,720
gut health issues and there's you know

169
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,319
there's a lot of rampant sibo diagnosis

170
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,680
going out there

171
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,800
constantly and we need we need it kind

172
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,319

to be a doctor you know and and that's

180
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720

181
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,400

not even a doctor I respect all of this

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,160
because what it means is there's

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,840
something inherently deep inside of us

187
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,039
that makes us want to help people and so

188
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,560
you know that but there's something when

189
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,319
you go to the doctor and you get you

190
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,319
know get told you get you know you get a

191
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,759
test or you know different kinds of

192
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,039
tests doctors do different things they

193
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:31,800
have different

194
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,759
do you know a breath a breath test

195
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,280
they'll do um you know some doctors

196
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,599
actually just start scooping out you

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,000
know they take a Q-tip and they start

198
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,879
doing cultures in the mouth and they're

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,360
doing that now they just start you know

200
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,120
what basically putting you know doing

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,199
cultures on on different areas of your

202
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,599
mouth looking for things and you know

203
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,360
stool samples right you know doctors

204
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,120
want to do that too and you know and you

205
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,919
get told you have

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,000
sibo and you're like okay well okay I

207
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
got sibo now what

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and a lot of good doctors be like well

209
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
you got to do the antibiotics you have

210
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,080
to do the antibiotics for sibo I don't

211
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,039
like doing the antibiotics for sibo I

212
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,159
don't like that because you know and and

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,240
I understand with respect with respect

214
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:20,360
you know that that's that's a tool

215
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,520
that's used out there but the problem is

216
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,479
with that is when it comes down to sibo

217
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,960
nobody knows what it is nobody knows

218
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,959
what it is it's just bacteria

219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:37,680
nobody knows what kind really what kind

220
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:40,240
like what's causing that overgrowth

221
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,279
what's causing what kind of bacteria is

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,800
that overgrowth I mean you some of you

223
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,839
probably already know the answer and

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,600
you're like oh yeah I know what he's

225
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:52,959
going to say and you're right I'm going

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,680
to say strep strep bacteria strep a

227
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,839
coaco stacus however people different

228
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,880
people call it different things for

229
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,040
different reason but the point is it's

230
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Str rep that's the bacteria that's

231
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,720
behind sio that's the front runner

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,760
that's the big front runner now how is

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,600
it possible we can't get a solid

234
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,640
diagnosis whether you do stool sample or

235
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,160
breath test or whatever it is how can we

236
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,560
get a solid

237
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,839
diagnosis of it being strep because it

238
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,959
can't because when streps been in the

239
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,320
system too long and it starts at

240
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
childhood for a whole bunch of reasons

241
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,360
it starts right from childhood

242
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,560
right at the very beginning could be

243
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,800
passed on from Mommy Daddy okay could be

244
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,519
passed on and it also could easily be

245
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,720
picked up so simply and you know in in

246
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,600
daycare center okay and you know and

247
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,640
kindergarten in school or whatever and

248
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,200
strep is easily passed along and there's

249
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,000
so many different varieties of strep

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,440
that when you start with it in the

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,279
system young it changes how it can ever

252
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:08,880
be tested for or discovered or

253
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,279
seen by medical research and medical

254
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,519
science in fact it's so elusive it's

255
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,920
virtually impossible to know how to

256
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
identify it or test for it for instance

257
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
you know I talked about this before you

258
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,240
know this that UTI are mostly strep

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,640
yeast is

260
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,560
present but they can't tests for the

261
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,120
strep now they look for strep for you

262
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,320
know when you're in the pregnancy MO

263
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,920
mode and and they want to you know they

264
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,000
want to do the strep test vaginally and

265
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,440
they look for it there and and sometimes

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,200
they'll they'll find it because they're

267
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,639
looking really hard for it uh but most

268
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
of the time it's impossible to find but

269
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,720
it's the only time they even kind of

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,360
research and science even care to kind

271
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,519
of look for it but you know it but it's

272
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,639
not tested or looked for with bacterial

273
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,959
vaginosis it's not which which is caused

274
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,399
by strep is the front runner it's not

275
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,440
it's not looked at with anything else

276
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,399
with UTI forget it it's never looked at

277
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,480
with e it's just UTI it's just a

278
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,920
bacterial infection it's just a yeast

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
infection and because strep is so

280
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,880
elusive it's really hard to test for

281
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,959
it's really hard to look at when it's

282
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:21,399
been there a long time it's been there a

283
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,800
long time and with sibo sibo is the

284
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,200
ultimate situation where strep is in the

285
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,680
body it's in the system it's in the

286
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
intestinal tract it's

287
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,480
there and

288
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,880
it's it's it can't be discovered so

289
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,720
easily in fact it's never discovered you

290
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,680
know and of course you can theoretically

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,079
say well you know doctor say well it

292
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,200
could be a bunch of different bacteria

293
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,680
it could be um a whole bunch of

294
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,000
different things but people have a lot

295
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,519
in them and I want to talk about

296
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
something I want to talk about something

297
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,320
a question that I'm always asked

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,320
question that I'm always asked by

299
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,440
professionals is how can there be

300
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
bacteria

301
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,360
in the

302
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:08,480
gut in general when we have hydrochloric

303
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,600
acid in the stomach that actually you

304
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,279
know kills off any bacteria that's

305
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,639
possible so how can there be bacteria

306
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,639
and then some professionals will say

307
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,320
well you know um in the intestinal tract

308
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,920
there's there's you know there's no

309
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,560
hydrochloric acid some professionals

310
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,920
will say so you know I could see

311
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
bacteria being in there but what about

312
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,079
the

313
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,480
stomach you know how is it possible to

314
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:34,120
bacteria in the

315
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,040
stomach and it's very possible very

316
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,199
possible so it's not just CBO is not

317
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,000
small intestinal track is what I'm

318
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,399
trying to say

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,959
sibo is

320
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:52,120
stomach dadum small intestinal track

321
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,199
large intestinal

322
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,600
track that's where you know sibo is it's

323
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,880
all the way at the beginning to all the

324
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,360
way to the

325
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:07,920
end sibo is even ESOP

326
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,639
esophagus sibo is even

327
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,079
mouth all the way down to

328
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,519
rectum so here's another thing that's

329
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:18,320
happening is is you know right now the

330
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,279
trend is um look you got it's small

331
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,600
intestinal tract overgrowth you got you

332
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,199
know you got some bacteria and that's

333
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,839
you know that's what we call

334
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:32,440
sio but it's it it's literally mouth all

335
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:35,680
all the way down and out to the

336
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,760
rectum that's where the bacteria H you

337
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,000
know can

338
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,519
lie and we have to keep that in mind

339
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,680
that's a big that's a big piece that's

340
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,480
kind of missing in the trendy atmosphere

341
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
of

342
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,160
sibo but how can it be there with

343
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,040
hydrochloric acid and the ability to

344
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,759
kind of use that hydrochloric acid to

345
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,160
break down and kill bacteria in the

346
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,079
stomach so some professionals be like

347
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,880
it's possible to have bacteria in the

348
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,720
stomach it's impossible it's not even

349
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,199
possible and that's not true that's not

350
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,519
true at all because you know spirit and

351
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,639
I brought to the table that hydrochloric

352
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,680
acid is

353
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:19,680
complicated it's not one

354
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:23,600
acid it's a blend so even if someone

355
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:26,040
seems to have elevated enough elevated

356
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,880
hydrochloric acid you guys someone that

357
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,440
seems like you know if the doctor's like

358
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,560
no your HC seems to be strong doing a

359
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
saliva test we're doing different

360
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,120
testing and and now your htl seems to be

361
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,759
strong you don't have real low

362
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,320
HCL you could have

363
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,959
low um different parts of the

364
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,880
hydrochloric acid combination that only

365
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,680
spirit and I have brought to the table I

366
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,079
say that in case you're you're brand new

367
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,360
to listening to the show and you're like

368
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,839
well what can he bring that's new and

369
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,920
different why is the show you know doing

370
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,519
so good what's what can he bring well

371
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:06,440
for one and and the whole hydrochloric

372
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:10,079
acid thing is it's a complex blend of

373
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,720
acids it's a seven blend it's a seven

374
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,519
blend and I love that number seven look

375
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
out for seven that's that's the number

376
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,240
you want to look out for keep your mind

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
and eye on that number you'll see it

378
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
popping up more and more so the

379
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,079
hydrochloric hasd blend took you off

380
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,160
track really sorry about that it took

381
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,160
you off track all right hey did I tell

382
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,720
you to fasten this your seat belts too

383
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,360
okay let's fasten your seat bels for

384
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,959
this this one it's going to get pretty

385
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,920
good so that seven

386
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:46,040
blend three of that seven blend could be

387
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:48,480
out gone low really low no one's going

388
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,040
to know no one's going to know because

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:56,399
four of that seven blend one of the four

390
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,079
of that seven blend is what everybody's

391
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,079
more familiar with it's what science and

392
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,759
research is familiar with look I've

393
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,079
always said this it's so important to

394
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,319
know I don't care how much technology we

395
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,680
have and I don't care how great science

396
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:10,199
is getting well I do care because I want

397
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,759
heart transplants I want everybody

398
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,240
getting liver transplants if they need

399
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,839
one I want kidneys replaced meaning I

400
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,319
want kidneys you know um I want I want

401
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,639
people to be able to donate a kidney I

402
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:25,720
want all these things and then some I

403
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,920
want it all but the problem is you know

404
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,880
when it comes down to just even the most

405
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
simplest thing of what happens to food

406
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,920
when it enters your mouth and goes when

407
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,880
it enters your stomach when it enters

408
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,680
your stomach what happens to food is a

409
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,240
mystery that will not be solved for

410
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,000
hundreds and hundreds of years I'm not

411
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,120
talking about decades I'm talking about

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,839
hundreds of

413
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,759
years that mystery will not be so solved

414
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
because I'm going to tell you right now

415
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,800
one of the reasons why it won't be

416
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,560
solved is because that's a Godly thing

417
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,399
that's a God thing that's where God

418
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,240
that's where it's it's a it's about God

419
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,199
okay it's about the higher power the

420
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,880
higher source it's whatever whatever you

421
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,679
believe is up there some people they say

422
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,480
well I just believe it's a light I'm I

423
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,000
go okay okay you know people say you

424
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,400
know I just believe there's a light up

425
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,480
there I go okay totally and you know I I

426
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,480
support that absolutely I'm I'm I'm so

427
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,880
thankful that you believe something is

428
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,600
out or up there and some people be like

429
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,480
I call it the Creator some people are

430
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,799
like you know and some people like you

431
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,840
know I call it the universe some people

432
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,640
are like yeah call and I'm like I of

433
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,960
course I mean I call it I call God

434
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,760
that's what I say it's God and that's

435
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,559
what I do and so whatever your belief is

436
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:46,840
of what's up there just know that that

437
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:48,880
has a hand on a handle on what happens

438
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,120
to food when it enters your

439
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,600
stomach what happens with food when it

440
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,600
enters your

441
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,000
stomach so as far as we are with

442
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,480
technology even in medical research and

443
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,080
science in different aspects in

444
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,240
different ways you know and we with all

445
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,880
the amazing things that we're

446
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
developing is that's the mystery all on

447
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,480
its own so can you imagine the mystery

448
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,320
of

449
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,280
sibo or bacteria and how it works in the

450
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,600
stomach or in the intestinal

451
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,600
track and that's why I'm kind of be

452
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:25,720
bringing that up so you can have some of

453
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,880
the some of those pieces of that seven

454
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,760
blend of the hydrochloric acid you can

455
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,520
have two or three low two or three

456
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,240
components elements to that seven

457
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,120
blend of hydrochloric acid they could be

458
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,640
low and even though you seem like you

459
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,360
have high

460
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,760
HCL

461
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:53,200
right and what happens then is bacteria

462
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,200
doesn't die it doesn't die when it

463
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,960
enters the stomach or when it goes up

464
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,039
into the stomach from the intestinal

465
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,559
tract so when and I was telling a

466
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,280
professional this I was telling somebody

467
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,559
this was a practitioner I was saying

468
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,039
look you have to understand that

469
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:15,799
bacteria moves and grooves it does a

470
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,360
dance okay and it and it it can travel

471
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,559
like yeah yeah yeah I know that I know

472
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,320
it could bacteria can travel I know that

473
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,000
go but it can travel up into your

474
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,760
stomach even if you think you got the

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,960
best strongest hydrochloric acid there

476
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,080
is to kill it it could travel up there

477
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,559
and get there so you want to keep your

478
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,679
hydrochloric acid strong so a big part

479
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,640
of what we're talking about today with

480
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,760
sios is keeping that hydrochloric acid

481
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,640
strong that's going to be a big part of

482
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,799
it really really big part because that

483
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,200
bacteria can crawl right up there and

484
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,840
get up into the

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,679
tummy and it can start doing things you

486
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,159
know there's people with ulcers they got

487
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:59,360
ulcers in the stomach these ulcers are

488
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:02,679
created by what by what back bacteria

489
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,840
they're created by bacteria these ulcers

490
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,919
Scar Tissue occurs ulcers they mend they

491
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,679
heel they open again mend in heel open

492
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,440
sores and ulcers in the stomach why

493
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,440
because there's bacteria there's people

494
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,720
with what seemingly seems like enough

495
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,799
hydrochloric acid and enough powerful

496
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,480
hydrochloric acid but why do they have

497
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,679
the ulcers because they're missing

498
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,159
pieces of the hydrochloric acid out of

499
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,080
the seven blend they're missing some of

500
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,200
them and maybe some of the most

501
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,799
important ones out of that seven

502
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,400
blend the most important ones so it's

503
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,200
about getting that hydrochloric acid

504
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,840
really strong it's about getting that

505
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,919
hydrochloric acid in a much better way

506
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,760
so bacteria can be in the stomach but it

507
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,240
can be in all kinds of different places

508
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,000
which bacteria we talking about we're

509
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,520
talking about talking about the

510
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,120
strep and that's the one and what I like

511
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,799
about strep it's once you got a hand

512
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,520
handle on what's going on once you know

513
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,640
what's going on you can take control you

514
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,080
can do stuff you can heal nothing can

515
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,880
stop you from healing once you have the

516
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,960
information the body the body wants to

517
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,840
heal but it has to connect to something

518
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,799
it has to connect to also information

519
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,080
that you've that you've

520
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,799
gathered you got to cut on your hand you

521
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,440
got to cut on your

522
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,120
hand and if you don't have information

523
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,720
your body wants to heal that cut if you

524
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,400
don't have information to keep that

525
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,840
wound

526
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,559
clean and

527
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,480
dry and care for it just say you don't

528
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,880
want to do any of that say you want to

529
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,039
bang your hand around stick it you know

530
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,480
stick stick it someplace grab something

531
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,559
all the time constantly injuring the

532
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,240
wound not ever cleaning it not ever

533
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,400
washing it out not ever putting a little

534
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,799
bandage on it for now not doing anything

535
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,520
there's a chance your body is going to

536
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,400
be like look we're doing everything we

537
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,799
can we got your immune system we got

538
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,679
your killer cells we got your blood

539
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,480
count we got everything on top of that

540
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,279
wound going going going and we're

541
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,720
knocking down that bacteria we're

542
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,480
knocking down anything else we're

543
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,480
knocking down staff that could get on

544
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,240
that

545
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,720
wound but it's too much because you

546
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,559
don't have the information to take care

547
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,360
of that wound you don't have the

548
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,880

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,400
herbal pus on

558
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,760
it P you know so whatever it is the

559
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,480
information has to be there too to help

560
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,240
the body to help the body you know some

561
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,120
people I my god I've heard this o over

562
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,320
the years people have gone to a lot of

563
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,279
different practitioners a lot of

564
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,760
different doctors they've been all over

565
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:04,840
the globe they've traveled everywhere

566
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,240
they've you know they've taken planes

567
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,279
across the I mean across the

568
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,720
world and for answers oh they're still

569
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,919
sick because their body wants to heal

570
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,120
it's keeping them going but they just

571
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,039
need the answers

572
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,480
too and that's the other half it's the

573
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:28,159
other

574
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,799
half knowing you know what's wrong is is

575
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,840
half the battle knowing how to heal it

576
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,960
is the other half of the battle spirit

577
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,880
taught me that Spirit taught me that a

578
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,880
long time ago when I was

579
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,520
young when I was really young when I was

580
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,480
in my single

581
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,760
digits and spirit tell me that half the

582
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,960
battle is knowing what's wrong the other

583
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,320
half is what to do about

584
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,320
it and you know and your body's fighting

585
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,840
for you no matter what in and out of all

586
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,559
of it

587
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,640
so with sibo

588
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,919
yeah with strep it's conquerable really

589
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,960
conquerable when you know what you're

590
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,320
dealing with here's here's something

591
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,159
that's important if you think your your

592
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,760
overgrowth of bacteria is a whole bunch

593
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:14,320
of different random bacteria and you

594
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,320
don't really know which ones it doesn't

595
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,039
help you it doesn't help

596
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,840
you enough it doesn't help you

597
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:26,559
enough but knowing this is the strep

598
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,399

soles when you had swollen tonsils this

606
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,600
is the strep that was that worst sinus

607
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,720
infection you had ever years

608
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,600
ago this is a strep that was that UTI

that was a pain in your butt that one

610
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,159
time in your life

611
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,840
when you know how to identify it this is

612
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:07,279
that strep that gave me sty in the eye

613
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,320
when you know how to identify it and

614
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,200
what it is it changes everything it

615
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,240
changes

616
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,520
everything everything I'm serious if you

617
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,000
know this is the strep that did the

618
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,120
sinus infection this is the strep that

619
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,840
gives you yeah that belly ache this is

620
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,240
the strep that gives you that

621
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,080
inflammation in different areas it

622
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,960
matters this is the strep that causes

623
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,039
all that severe cystic

624
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,200
acne and now all of a sudden I'm

625
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,440
diagnosed years later with with

626
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,640
sibo a people

627
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,000
say they're diagnosed you know years

628
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,840
later with sibo and they're like okay

629
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,520
what's this now when you know what it is

630
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,760
and what's been in your system it's

631
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,159
lifechanging it's lifechanging maybe

632
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,840
some of you are like oh I don't want to

633
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,480
know what it is I kind of like going to

634
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,679
the doctor and just been like okay what

635
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,320
is it okay I'll just take this

636
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:59,080
antibiotic and I respect that I honor

637
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:01,080
that because you know it's not it's not

638
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,000
it's not like everything's so easy it's

639
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,320
it's not so I'm with you but hang in

640
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,679
there if you're one of those you know

641
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,840
kind of people you know just know I love

642
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,919
you and you're one of those kind of

643
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,520
people that're like look I don't know

644
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,679
what's going on but but hang in there

645
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,840
because it's still we're still going to

646
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,000
do some things that that are helpful

647
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,000
because if you're dealing with something

648
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,399
you're suffering or you're really going

649
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,880
through something it's important to know

650
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,880
these

651
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,480
things so knowing what it is is

652
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,520
important and that's the key knowing

653
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,440
that it's just a melt pot a bacteria

654
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,559
that's possibly in your stomach no Rhyme

655
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,440
or Reason Tak an antibiotic hope for the

656
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,880
best is really not not the best and L

657
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,799
even in when it's alternative

658
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,200
medicine and you know you get a really

659
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,279
good practitioner and they give you some

660
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,320
herbs and they change your diet you need

661
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,559
to know more because it's time to

662
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,960
conquer the bacteria that's wreaking

663
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,559
havoc or causing problems or interfering

664
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,919
with your life on any level

665
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,919
level interfering with your life on any

666
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,559
level and we want to do that we want to

667
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:07,080
be able to do

668
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,640
that so we have to look back at our

669
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,440
lives and see well what happened earlier

670
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,159
on in my life where could I what you

671
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,520
know I did have a strep throat earlier

672
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,440
on in my life whoa I see and that's

673
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,919
that's how it works so strep is kind of

674
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,679
elusive it stays in her body it lives in

675
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,440
US it lives in us now the reason why I

676
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:29,600
don't like the antibiotics with strep is

677
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,080
because it it empow strep Don't Panic if

678
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,399
you taking antibiotics it's fine meaning

679
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,039
don't don't worry don't be like oh my

680
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,120
God I took an antibiotic forward it must

681
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,600
have been strep no it's it it listen

682
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,720
it's okay the point is it's about

683
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,559
forging ahead moving

684
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:49,640
forward so strep tends to change it

685
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,720
tends to get smart wise it gets immune

686
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,120
to antibiotics and you got to do it use

687
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,200
a different antibiotic I know people

688
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,880
that have suffered from severe UTI

689
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,399
because of strep and they've had to

690
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,159
change different antibiotics they have

691
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:02,760
to do a cocktail of antibiotics I've

692
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,960
seen that over the years same thing with

693
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,000
stomach problems same thing with Leebo

694
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,279
same thing with other things and it the

695
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,799
problem is is that strep tends to not

696
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:18,840
get affected by the antibiotic anymore

697
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:20,320
and it gets immune and it grows past it

698
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,720
and it could get stronger and it can

699
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,760
mutate and there's a lot of different

700
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,320
varieties of strep now I think medical

701
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,840
science research have something like

702
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,320
groups through a through H so strep a

703
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,960
the strep B those are the two main

704
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,880
groups that science and research have

705
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,120
been working with all these years and

706
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,919
then it went you know then finally you

707
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,840
know some some some funding and research

708
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,240
went to a right the right place for at

709
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,519
least the

710
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,720
recognizing recognizing the fact that

711
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,559
there's more groups sounds like a

712
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:54,320
through H but there's not enough letters

713
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,960
in the alphabet to match the groups and

714
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,039
that's where it falls short that's where

715
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,240
I was saying where the thumb is on the

716
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,880
scale because I'm sure some amazing

717
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,360
scientist or researcher that was

718
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,880
researching the different groups of

719
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,360
trying to classify the different groups

720
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,080
of stre strep looking at them under the

721
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,000
microscope wherever it can be gathered

722
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,720
out of people I'm sure these amazing

723
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,159
practitioners are like in the lab saying

724
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,960
oh my God I think there's I think

725
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:26,279
there's way more past a strep group a to

726
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,559
Group H I think there's a lot more here

727
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:31,960
and they can't do anything about it

728
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,600
because someone else is in the way of

729
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,200
everything I said originally when I was

730
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,919
opening the show something else is in

731
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,640
the way some some interest group is in

732
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,559
the way for the scientists to be like

733
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,200
wait a minute here we got a

734
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,360
problem so so if there was you know

735
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,760
there's not enough letters in the

736
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,200
alphabet to match the amount of

737
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,919
mutations and the group of strep that's

738
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,320
creating the sibo the whole sibo effect

739
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,320
that we're we're seeing out there

740
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:06,120
and so taking control understanding what

741
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:10,159
it is is actually starts to break down

742
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:13,840
the bug itself so right now you and me

743
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,320
just you right now together okay you and

744
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,440
me know we

745
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,360
know that that little bug is weak and

746
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,760
I'll tell you why it's

747
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:30,640
weak because your immune system is going

748
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:34,240
after it as we're talking right now see

749
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,799
knowing what's wrong knowing what to do

750
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,960
okay that's that's the two pieces that

751
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:40,880
Spirit taught me going all the way back

752
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,360
knowing what's wrong knowing what to do

753
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,320
what happens is when you know what's

754
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,000
wrong your immune system connects to

755
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,640
your thoughts you know that part you

756
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,159
know your thoughts help govern your

757
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:56,559
immune system you know that and but when

758
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,320
you really know what you're after

759
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,200
something really takes off really takes

760
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,240
off and really takes place this is this

761
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,159
is even more advanced than a whole thing

762
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,399
kind of the thought power thing where

763
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,799
you know you're you're thinking you're

764
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:13,279
thinking you're healing and that's

765
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:14,880
powerful where you're thinking your body

766
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,960
can heal and that's powerful but you can

767
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,120
take it to another level when you take

768
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,880
it to the level of wait a minute I know

769
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,559
it's giving me that small intestinal

770
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,240
tract overgrowth now I know what bug it

771
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:34,559
is what happens is your killer cells can

772
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,399
connect to that very thing it can create

773
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,840
what's an identification process that's

774
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,880
beyond beyond our vision it's an

775
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,679
identification process to the bacteria

776
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,720
that means the immune system starts to

777
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,440
redesign itself so your immune system

778
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,039
right now right in this moment is

779
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,159
redesigning

780
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,519
itself seriously it's redesigning it

781
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,279
itself I'm going to tell you how through

782
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,919
chemical compounds chemical

783
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,919
compounds our immune system has the

784
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,919
ability to shape shift it has the

785
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,559
ability to redirect itself it has the

786
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,440
ability to take on new information just

787
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:17,480
through frequencies of thought but it

788
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,960
has more than that even more than all of

789
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,600
that it has the ability to restructure

790
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,240
chemical compounds not found in any

791
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,200
science of research and maybe that'll be

792
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,760
decades ahead of the time maybe two two

793
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,840
three decades from now maybe 30 40

794
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,559
years from now they'll figure out that

795
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,080
chemical compounds are created by your

796
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,880
different immune system you know your

797
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,320
lymphocytes for example how they can

798
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,760
change they can change by creating a new

799
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,000
chemical that matches the understanding

800
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,159
and information that you know about

801
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,960
what's inside your body a chemical

802
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:58,039
compound can develop from that alone and

803
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:01,360
change to look for a bug that's been

804
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,720
immune it's been immune to your immune

805
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,279
system you know how we we're always like

806
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,039
well you know let's we want we want to

807
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,279
be immune to

808
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,960
something we want to be immune to

809
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,240
something if you're dealing with

810
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,840
something emotional you know if you're

811
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,519
dealing with problems emotionally if you

812
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,120
have somebody that's that if you or you

813
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,880
have somebody that's just causing

814
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,919
trouble bullying or you got somebody in

815
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,320
the workplace or whatever you want to be

816
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,799
immune to them so you want you want to

817
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,559
create

818
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,399
something a foundation or you want to

819
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,720
create something that could make you

820
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:35,320
immune to them what I like to do is I

821
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,840
like to use the word

822
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,080
light in those

823
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,679
situations if there's nothing more

824
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,919
powerful somebody's bullying you at work

825
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,360
someone's giving you a hard time or

826
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,360
whatever it is I say the word

827
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:52,200
light that's what I like to

828
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,240
do and you here's here's the deal and

829
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,519
I'm going to talk more about that in in

830
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,840
another show we're going to talk more

831
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,960
about that but the deal is the bug can

832
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,440
have immunity too to our immune system

833
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,519
and when you know what's going on and

834
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,080
you know what's causing it it changes

835
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,639
that your immune system changes and

836
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,240
Alters in order to kill the bug and rid

837
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:16,679
the U and R rid the sibo and and and rid

838
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,240
the the um bacterial

839
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,720
infections and you know rid the pelvic

840
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,280
inflammatory um problems that that that

841
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,000
a lot of women have too which is caused

842
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,639
by different groups of strep and rids

843
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,159
everything the sty that keep on coming

844
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,639
the sore throats that keep on coming the

845
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,359
sinus infections that keep on

846
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,839
coming and of course the sibo the

847
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,599
intestinal tract issue too so not only

848
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,720
are we going to rebuild hydrochloric

849
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,839
acid which what we're going to talk

850
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,040
about next but it's about changing

851
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,040
changing the structure of the immune

852
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,839
system having it create new chemical

853
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,200
compounds that strep is not immune to so

854
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:00,800
so we can destroy it so we can start

855
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,079
kicking it out of her body and that's

856
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,839
why it's important to know what's going

857
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
on so when you know and I've heard it

858
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,160
before someone said you know said to me

859
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,240
a while back I forget how long ago now

860
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,359
this is but and I've heard it over the

861
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,720
years here and there where somebody like

862
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,560
I really don't want to know I don't want

863
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,599
to know I just want to go to the doctor

864
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,119
and I just want to know everything's

865
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,040
okay and I didn't walk out and I don't

866
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,599
want to know really what's what's

867
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,520
happening in there and I'm I'm too young

868
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,160
for to think about these things and I

869
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,280
want to go out and I want to you know I

870
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,119
want to have fun I want to have fun and

871
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,320
I I of course we should have fun we need

872
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,079
to have fun but it comes the time we

873
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,560
need to know what's going on too inside

874
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,920
of us to heal so let's get our

875
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,640
hydrochloric acid built up when you get

876
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,480
your hydrochloric acid built up you're

877
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,359
killing bacteria that's trying to even

878
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,000
get into the stomach and more than that

879
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,280
hydrochloric acid runs deeper than the

880
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,400
stomach it runs

881
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,560
lower than the stomach how hydrochloric

882
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,400
acid Works in the

883
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,960
dadum and here's another thing unknown

884
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,800
to research and science hydrochloric

885
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,400
acid Works in the small intestinal tract

886
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,280
but it goes down deeper in the small

887
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:16,079
intestinal tract one of the reasons why

888
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:19,359
that research and science isn't keen on

889
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:23,359
that is because they're looking at one

890
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,800
element one part one fraction of the

891
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,079
seven blend hydrochloric acid that I'm

892
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,040
talking about that not looking at the

893
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,200
other

894
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,920
six and some of the other six have a

895
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,680
responsibility they have a

896
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,599
responsibility to go deep into the small

897
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,520
intestinal tract and start killing off

898
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,560
bacteria and working with your immune

899
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,000
system working with your lymphocytes

900
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:53,000
monocytes nutrifil basophils basil B all

901
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,599
of that working with that and so that's

902
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,400
why it's important to really enhance and

903
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:57,359
rebuild this you know that hydrochloric

904
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,079
acid

905
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,520
why on

906
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:05,520
Instagram are people saying you know on

907
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,000
on the medical medium Instagram their

908
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,960
lives have changed and they've been

909
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,440
everywhere they've done

910
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,880
everything but their lives have changed

911
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,480
because of this green celery juice and

912
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,720
only celery juice that's sitting in

913
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,920
their hand why is that happening and and

914
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,680
how come nobody else knew that straight

915
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,319
celery juice has the power to do this

916
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,359
besides spirit because of spirit that's

917
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:31,000
why that's why nobody knew Spirit knows

918
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,240
I wouldn't even know I wouldn't know any

919
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,359
of this I wouldn't know any of the

920
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,400
information I've ever written about or

921
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,040
put out there I wouldn't know a single

922
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,960
piece of it if it wasn't for Spirit we

923
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,400
know that you know it's Spirit people

924
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,760
say you're the greatest someone said to

925
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,520
me you're the greatest well I was out

926
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,079
the other day cuz I I was forced to have

927
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,960
to leave the leave the office and

928
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,160
someone said you're hey you're you're

929
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,760
you're Anthony I said yeah how you doing

930
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,000
he said you're the greatest and I'm like

931
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,480
no I'm not spirit is the greatest

932
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,599
because really I don't know anything

933
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,960
it's Spirit anyway the bottom line is

934
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,040
that celery juice that celery juice is

935
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,079
that powerful and it's life-changing

936
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,079
because it builds up that structure okay

937
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,400
I want to tell you something about the

938
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
celery ju I never talked about when you

939
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,599
buy celery you're you're buying

940
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,040
different celery from different farms at

941
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:26,839
different times of the year so when you

942
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,640
go to the store and you're buying celery

943
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:32,240
it's a different Farm it's not always

944
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,160
the same farm and sometimes it's the

945
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,880
same Farm growing celery in a new

946
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:43,319
field or in a different

947
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,319
field and it changes that mineral

948
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:48,160
composition so what I'm saying is you're

949
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,680
getting celery from a juice Place

950
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,880
chances are the celery came from a

951
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,040
different place this is a good thing

952
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,720
this isn't a bad thing you're getting

953
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,800
celery from your Co-op it's a good thing

954
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,520
it's a different batch of celery you're

955
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,040
getting you know from a different farm

956
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,200
that was out in California shipped

957
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,760
across the United States possibly a

958
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,040
different one all this all this

959
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,440
matters because celery juice has

960
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,440
different compositions of mineral salts

961
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,640
but all the same but different

962
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,200
levels and that's the key to rebuilding

963
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,599
the hydrochloric acid too if you could

964
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
only have one celery and it's all you

965
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,640
can get and it's one Farm only for the

966
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,079
rest of your life then that's fine too

967
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:27,680
believe me that'll also help move you

968
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,280
forward and you'll heal

969
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,440
so why is celery so important because

970
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:38,280
that mineral blend was meant to actually

971
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,400
restore those missing components out of

972
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,960
your hydrochloric acid blend the seven

973
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,440
blend remember I told you look out for

974
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,240
seven look out for that number look out

975
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,440
for

976
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:52,680
seven seven is so profoundly powerful

977
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,960
for so many reasons when it comes down

978
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,760
to the human body and it comes down to

979
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,480
the way things are structured in in the

980
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:02,160
human body the way things are designed

981
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,119
in the human body the way things are

982
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,240
created and seven actually matters in so

983
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,760
many different ways with the immune

984
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,880
system with everything hydrochloric acid

985
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,200
I can go on and on with the liver you

986
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,720
you it's seven has a lot to do with

987
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,920
what's happening in our bodies for that

988
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,920
seven Hydrochloric blend to build back

989
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,119
up and kill off and this is what happens

990
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,599
the mineral salts are poisonous the

991
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:29,200
mineral salts in celery are poisonous to

992
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:32,640
bacteria they're poisonous not poisonous

993
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,800
to you I promise you they rebuild that

994
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,079
missing seven blend so the mineral salts

995
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,839
in the celery rebuild the missing seven

996
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,839
blend Hydrochloric acids that are

997
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,640
combined in there that alone helps kill

998
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,440
off any kind of SEO bacteria any kind of

999
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,960
strep bacteria but it also enhances the

1000
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,520
immune system the immune system rides

1001
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,000
off of creating chemical compounds like

1002
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
I was just saying so your lymphocytes

1003
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,800
can create chemical compounds how do

1004
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,280
they create them what are they made out

1005
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,839
of what chemical compounds are we

1006
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,000
talking about I know I'm I know I'm

1007
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,520
going into some deep

1008
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,920
space but the chemical compounds are

1009
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,520
made out of salts made out of salts this

1010
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,720
doesn't mean you go run and start ding

1011
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,079
yourself with salt doesn't mean you

1012
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,560
start filling you start eating a ton of

1013
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:22,280
salt don't don't even do that that's not

1014
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,480
what I'm talking about talking about the

1015
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,280
celery and it's even some of it's even

1016
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,040
in the spinach stems so spin

1017
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,960
itself and and you know so those have

1018
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,440
you know sodium salts too that are

1019
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:38,440
special and designed in a special

1020
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,599
way so this type of these mineral salts

1021
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,880
that are in the

1022
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,480
celery they're used they're gathered by

1023
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,000
your white count that destroys sibo for

1024
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,599
good and moves it out of your body for

1025
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,240
good they utilize that because it what

1026
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:54,960
what your immune system cells what your

1027
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,000
immune cells can do is create chemical

1028
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,640
compounds devised devised out of those

1029
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,400
mineral salts from the celery science

1030
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,240
and research we're talking light years

1031
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,319
away from knowing that piece of it light

1032
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,599
years and but it's important to know

1033
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,040
that because you start looking for that

1034
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,200
you're not going to find that you start

1035
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,280
hopping on the internet you start

1036
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,280
looking for that you're not going to

1037
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,880
find

1038
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,040
that so the bottom line is we want to

1039
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,960
rebuild that up and you're doing that

1040
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,040
with celery that's one thing you can do

1041
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,880
but I'm giving you the information you

1042
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,839
guys I'm giving you this stuff so you

1043
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,240
know why you're getting better so you

1044
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,359
know why when you're on when you're

1045
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,640
doing the Instagram when you're seeing

1046
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,960
the Instagram you see somebody getting

1047
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,000
better so you know why things are

1048
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,520
happening this is one of the reasons

1049
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,760
because your immune system wants to kill

1050
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,720
every virus and every bacteria that we

1051
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,480
have in our body it just needs the right

1052
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,880
sodium salts or the right chemical salts

1053
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,880
meaning that are in chemical compounds

1054
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,319
that they can create new chemical

1055
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,800
compounds that are in vegetables and

1056
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,680
fruits I want to talk about fruit fear

1057
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,000
for a minute when it comes down to any

1058
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,480
type of problem someone thinks they have

1059
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,520
whether it's candida whether it's yeast

1060
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,319
whether it's mold whatever it is whether

1061
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,000
it's bacteria sibo they're told not to

1062
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:10,359
eat any fruit ever and it creates a

1063
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,800
fruit fear like no other you know I did

1064
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:15,200
a show on fruit fear you you guys know

1065
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,400
that I did a show and there's a chapter

1066
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,520
on fruit fear in medical medium book

1067
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,880
one and you know so I take you know you

1068
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,720
know I've taken it seriously but it's

1069
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,160
getting worse out there it's getting

1070
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:32,040
worse and worse and worse someone might

1071
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,839
say and argue hey look yeah but I got

1072
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,480
off of all my bad foods I even kept

1073
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:39,680
fruit out and got off of all my you know

1074
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,640
pizza and cheese and other stuff and I

1075
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,920
just eat a really clean clean clean diet

1076
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
some protein and some vegetables because

1077
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,280
a book out there says that that's going

1078
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,680
to be you know beneficial in some that's

1079
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,680
going to be beneficial and it's going to

1080
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,760
help you fight this and that and I felt

1081
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,800
better of course you're going to feel

1082
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,800
better because if you eat cleaner food

1083
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,000
you're going to feel better if you eat

1084
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,400
cleaner foods but if you're somebody

1085
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,559
that's really been struggling and

1086
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,760
suffering and been to every doctor tried

1087
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,839
everything and they're past that point

1088
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,359
not past that point of not healing I'm

1089
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:12,359
talking about past the point where

1090
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:14,720

way P you know you're past that whole

1096
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:28,480
thing the fruit's critical because the

1097
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,359
fruit does matter the fruit really does

1098
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,240
matter cuz you take somebody who really

1099
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,040
needs the fruit and the right kind of

1100
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,119
foods and you take them and you put them

1101
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,040
on the kind of you know just clean diet

1102
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,599

1105
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,839
they're going to hit a wall I've seen it

1106
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,200
happen for years and years and years

1107
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,200
what I'm saying is don't be afraid of

1108
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,520
fruit even if you're on a Clean Diet

1109
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,839
regardless of what that is is protein

1110
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,440
and vegetables whatever whether you're

1111
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,559

1112
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,599

meat protein whatever it is don't keep

1114
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:04,280
fruit out I've seen I've seen

1115
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:06,079

1117
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,040

bananas are bad everything's

1119
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,280
bad um and but I'm doing tons and tons

1120
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:16,640
of protein powders and tons of

1121
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,760
vegetables as a vegan they'll say same

1122
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,480
thing with you somebody who's a meat

1123
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,960
eater like no just you know lean cut

1124
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,079
animal protein and lots of vegetables

1125
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,720
don't keep the fruit out one of the

1126
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,079
reasons is the fruit kills

1127
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,960
the bacteria that causes

1128
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:35,440
sibo it kills

1129
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,880
it there's assets that are naturally in

1130
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,520
fruit fruit

1131
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,800
acids that dissolve bacteria sometimes

1132
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,640
it's why people some people be like well

1133
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,559
I kind of feel like I'm detoxing and I

1134
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,480
eat a lot of fruit because you are

1135
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,960
detoxing you are detoxing detoxing for

1136
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,760
the first time in your life

1137
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,440
actually and that's how critical fruit

1138
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,559
is like bananas

1139
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,400
yeah bananas bananas are now becoming

1140
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,880
the

1141
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,440
Antichrist literally the Antichrist

1142
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,640
because of

1143
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,520
practitioners that are writing books

1144
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,880
that are influenced by information that

1145
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:14,240
came out about 8 nine years ago that was

1146
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,160
never even lab created

1147
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:21,200
information it was a poisonous Theory

1148
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,119
came out for a reason to stop you from

1149
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,599
ever eating a banana again to stop you

1150
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,319
from ever eating certain fruits again

1151
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:31,200
this is contaminated

1152
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,839
information that certain famous people

1153
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,280
well-known people have made sure they

1154
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,520
got it into the alternative system about

1155
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:42,160
9 10 years ago I remember when it

1156
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,800
happened and don't get poisoned by that

1157
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,599
information don't be afraid of eating a

1158
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,319
banana something very important what

1159
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:52,400
does the banana do it grabs on to

1160
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,160
sibo and look if you're somebody that

1161
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,920
says oh I don't know if it's streping me

1162
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,200
but I got sibo and the doctor said that

1163
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:02,119
I got lots of bacteria then a banana is

1164
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,480
that powerful it can grab onto that

1165
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,359
bacteria and pull it out it doesn't feed

1166
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,000
the bacteria it kills the bacteria

1167
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:14,040
suffocates it pulls it out something to

1168
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,119
know so all fruit is good all vegetables

00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,799
battling strep so you do want zinc in

1269
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,920
your system so that's another thing too

1270
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:25,920
the liquid sink I always talk

1271
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:29,880
about and um and the B12 and the B 12 is

1272
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,400
important too Elderberry so elderberry

1273
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,640
tea you can get the Elderberry

1274
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,680
elderberry tea is a great one for sibo

1275
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,119
if anybody's into chocolate terrible for

1276
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,400
sibo one of the worst things in the

1277
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,400
world for sibo so I'm just saying if you

1278
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,920
don't have sibo and you love chocolate

1279
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,680
hey don't let anything stand in your way

1280
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,359
I'm just saying if you got small

1281
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,839
intestinal over overgrowth you know

1282
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,720
diagnosis that you the bacterial

1283
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:55,200
overgrowth diagnosis that has been given

1284
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,720
to you stay away from chocolate if you

1285
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,839
have have that

1286
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,319
diagnosis stay away from chocolate you

1287
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,680
can have a little bit if you're really

1288
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,680
into it you can have a little bit here

1289
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,119
and there but C cut it back some people

1290
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,760
eat a ton of it they have it every

1291
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,799
single day so I'm worried about that if

1292
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,040
someone has an issue that that's too

1293
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:16,280
