[159.24 - 163.56] the cranial nerves play a large role in
[161.22 - 165.90] chronic mystery illness and guess what
[163.56 - 168.90] in the 35 years of me getting
[165.90 - 170.52] information out there
[168.90 - 172.02] couldn't find a doctor that could ever
[170.52 - 174.54] know that
[172.02 - 177.18] that inflammation of the cranial nerves
[174.54 - 179.58] plays a large role in chronic mystery
[177.18 - 180.90] illness you'll never hear that out of
[179.58 - 183.66] anyone that's how advanced this
[180.90 - 186.84] information is like boom
[183.66 - 189.96] what page am I on Lisa Marie page 97
[186.84 - 192.48] chapter 6. I am at your service you're
[189.96 - 193.98] in flame cranial nerves I am going to
[192.48 - 198.12] read a little bit to you guys if you
[193.98 - 200.64] guys are okay to hear it
[198.12 - 204.26] or if you're available
[200.64 - 204.26] is everybody available here
[205.32 - 212.04] as I always say as I always say
[208.92 - 216.98] mystery illness misrealness which is
[212.04 - 216.98] 99.9 of all chronic mystery illness duh
[217.62 - 222.48] it's a much broader category than anyone
[219.54 - 226.62] realizes we think that if a condition
[222.48 - 228.78] has a name this part here blows me away
[226.62 - 230.64] you can talk to like health
[228.78 - 232.20] professionals and they won't even get
[230.64 - 234.30] this you can say it over and over to
[232.20 - 236.76] them and they won't even understand what
[234.30 - 238.62] you're even saying I I know I've dealt
[236.76 - 240.72] with this before check this out
[238.62 - 243.84] we think of that ready
[240.72 - 245.88] we think that if a condition has a name
[243.84 - 247.80] your lupus your fibromyalgia your
[245.88 - 249.84] Hashimoto's thyroiditis list goes on on
[247.80 - 252.36] whatever
[249.84 - 255.12] such as anxiety fatigue pots vertigo
[252.36 - 257.70] Bells Palsy neuropathy ocular migraines
[255.12 - 260.58] then it must not be a mystery to the
[257.70 - 262.86] medical research and science group
[260.58 - 265.02] because it has a name it doesn't have
[262.86 - 267.96] it's not a mystery anymore that's the
[265.02 - 269.82] biggest confusion out there you can be a
[267.96 - 271.92] doctor go to medical school come out of
[269.82 - 274.14] medical school know that a condition has
[271.92 - 276.48] a name get a blood test for somebody's
[274.14 - 278.58] thyroid or whatever and then now you got
[276.48 - 281.22] a name for the thyroid problem
[278.58 - 285.00] but you don't have anything else it's
[281.22 - 286.92] still a mystery 100 percent a mystery
[285.00 - 288.72] hi vegan Allison
[286.92 - 290.70] I see you said hi Emma I see your
[288.72 - 293.90] comments a lot on YouTube you know it's
[290.70 - 293.90] still a mystery
[293.94 - 297.50] that's the whole point
[298.74 - 302.46] so if we think fatigue pots vertigo
[300.72 - 304.32] Bell's Palsy neuropathy or ocular
[302.46 - 306.06] migraines and it must not be a mystery
[304.32 - 309.24] and more problem solved you guys you
[306.06 - 312.66] have an ocular migraine problem solved
[309.24 - 314.64] do you guys have pots problem solved if
[312.66 - 316.50] you guys get a vertigo diagnosis problem
[314.64 - 319.92] solved right there's no mystery anymore
[316.50 - 321.54] think about that that's how absurd it
[319.92 - 323.82] all is when you think about it this
[321.54 - 327.36] piece of information alone is a game
[323.82 - 329.52] changer in medical research and science
[327.36 - 332.28] right is your problem solved because
[329.52 - 338.06] you've got uh Bell's Palsy or fatigue
[332.28 - 338.06] diagnosis is your it's still a mystery
[340.86 - 345.00] anyone who has struggled with any
[342.96 - 347.04] chronic health issue knows that this
[345.00 - 348.60] isn't how it works you guys know that
[347.04 - 351.48] this isn't how it works if you get a
[348.60 - 354.30] lupus diagnosis an ALS diagnosis
[351.48 - 356.46] anything else whatever whatever
[354.30 - 359.42] diagnosis pepper seed good to see you
[356.46 - 362.64] whatever it is
[359.42 - 364.20] it's still a mystery anyone who has
[362.64 - 366.54] struggled in chronic health issues you
[364.20 - 368.16] guys if you just came on your inflamed
[366.54 - 369.96] cranial nerves we're talking about a
[368.16 - 372.00] crate this is something you don't want

[372.00 - 375.54] this is a live that's very important
[374.04 - 378.06] because we're talking about cranial
[375.54 - 381.00] nerve inflammation and it's such a
[378.06 - 383.64] problem it's why almost everybody has a
[381.00 - 386.16] symptom think about that if you don't
[383.64 - 388.86] have the brain saver books please
[386.16 - 393.78] please check them out go to the
[388.86 - 398.10] bookstore amazon.com us is 40 author 600

[416.58 - 421.82] dude thank you for being here man and
[418.80 - 421.82] you're on YouTube I saw
[422.10 - 426.78] all right
[424.50 - 429.00] being handed a label for your set of
[426.78 - 431.64] symptoms isn't the same as receiving
[429.00 - 433.02] answers about why those symptoms are
[431.64 - 435.30] interrupting your life in the first
[433.02 - 437.78] place getting a label doesn't mean jack
[438.66 - 442.32] you got a label you go home with a label
[441.06 - 444.18] great
[442.32 - 446.58] you got a label now
[444.18 - 448.92] great
[446.58 - 451.02] but it doesn't mean enough
[448.92 - 454.32] it doesn't mean Jack
[451.02 - 457.92]  it doesn't the whole point is
[454.32 - 459.60] you can have a label like depression but
[457.92 - 463.52] you ain't gonna get better unless you
[459.60 - 463.52] know what's wrong with the real cause is
[465.54 - 470.16] whether you're living with a diagnosis a
[467.94 - 472.02] misdiagnosis or a non-diagnosis there
[470.16 - 474.60] are answers to be found in getting to
[472.02 - 478.10] know your brain stem
[474.60 - 481.14] your brain stem and your cranial nerves
[478.10 - 483.36] this is what it's about right here the
[481.14 - 485.64] cranial nerves I mean the whole these
[483.36 - 488.28] two books alone and what's in here like
[485.64 - 490.98] I said I can't even get out of chapter
[488.28 - 492.90] six like I'm stuck in chapter six
[490.98 - 494.52] because it's that there's so much
[492.90 - 495.96] information but there's so much
[494.52 - 497.82] information in every line of the book
[495.96 - 499.38] you can just open it up
[497.82 - 501.78] I got a doctor friend that opened up the
[499.38 - 504.62] book was like
[501.78 - 504.62] what
[504.84 - 510.30] it's like it literally it's every line
[507.72 - 511.80] okay cranial nerve answers your cranial
[510.30 - 514.62] nerves include your vagus nerves
[511.80 - 517.32] trigeminal nerves facial nerves
[514.62 - 521.64] among many others your cranial nerves
[517.32 - 526.02] extend out of your brain stem so
[521.64 - 528.80] your cranial nerves extend out of your
[526.02 - 528.80] brain stem
[529.68 - 535.02] and when they get inflamed
[532.08 - 537.60] all the crap goes down
[535.02 - 541.20] all the crap goes down
[537.60 - 543.00] doctor after doctor after doctor when
[541.20 - 545.58] those nerves coming out of the brain
[543.00 - 548.10] stem get inflamed it's doctor it's
[545.58 - 550.74] functional doctor it's natural doctor
[548.10 - 553.04] it's conventional doctor it's every
[550.74 - 553.04] doctor
[555.18 - 559.62] your cranial nerves extend out of your
[557.16 - 561.18] brain stem and many symptoms of chronic
[559.62 - 564.72] illness derived from these cranial
[561.18 - 565.80] nerves if a cranial nerve is inflamed in
[564.72 - 567.98] any way
[565.80 - 571.38] check this out
[567.98 - 574.38] inflamed in any way
[571.38 - 578.28] because of viral neurotoxins doctors
[574.38 - 580.56] don't know about I'm not trying to be
[578.28 - 582.84] you know mean
[580.56 - 584.88] it's going to say some other word I'm
[582.84 - 589.10] glad I didn't say it right I'm not
[584.88 - 589.10] trying to be a jerk
[589.22 - 593.52] I'm just saying they don't know about
[591.54 - 595.56] neurotoxins they don't know about what's
[593.52 - 598.02] even in here this is so Advanced when
[595.56 - 601.26] you even think about it
[598.02 - 604.14] Erica Erica Hey on YouTube
[601.26 - 605.88] labels are meant to shut us up like we
[604.14 - 609.12] should be satisfied with the diagnosis
[605.88 - 611.10] 100 correct that's what I've been saying
[609.12 - 613.38] right you've read the books it's
[611.10 - 615.78] supposed to shut you up
[613.38 - 618.30] it's like shut up here's your here's
[615.78 - 622.02] your label and shut up get out of here
[618.30 - 625.08] now take this drug and get out of here
[622.02 - 627.80] call us if you have another problem what
[625.08 - 627.80] it didn't go away
[630.12 - 635.46] if a cranial nerve is inflamed in any
[632.34 - 637.68] way because listen to this because of
[635.46 - 639.36] viral neurotoxins which none of the
[637.68 - 641.76] doctors knew about unless they got
[639.36 - 643.56] medical medium books then they know
[641.76 - 644.70] about viral neurotoxins because you guys
[643.56 - 647.22] that didn't exist there was no such
[644.70 - 649.56] thing as a viral neurotoxin until the
[647.22 - 651.00] medical medium books came out so when
[649.56 - 653.58] you hear a functional doctor even
[651.00 - 655.22] mention it now it duh where did it come
[653.58 - 658.92] from published material
[655.22 - 661.32] plagiarizing anyone chemical poisons and
[658.92 - 664.20] toxins such as toxic heavy metals nobody
[661.32 - 666.60] knew toxic heavy metals and get on and
[664.20 - 669.06] inflame a cranial nerve nobody knew that
[666.60 - 671.94] or even physical injury then symptoms
[669.06 - 673.86] can occur your cranial nerves are also
[671.94 - 675.96] affected by what's going on with your
[673.86 - 677.76] neurons so what's going on with your
[675.96 - 679.80] neurons if there's something wrong with
[677.76 - 682.20] your neurons in here right here you guys
[679.80 - 683.64] it's going to affect your cranial nerves
[682.20 - 686.10] if you just got on here and you're like
[683.64 - 688.80] what's he talking about cranial nerves
[686.10 - 689.94] dude I'm talking about everything I'm
[688.80 - 691.62] talking about so many symptoms
[689.94 - 694.14] conditions when you deal with cranial
[691.62 - 696.90] nerve problems
[694.14 - 699.18] this is information I'm freely just
[696.90 - 701.70] giving out and talking about this is a
[699.18 - 704.34] free class right here
[701.70 - 705.90] most advanced Medical information out
[704.34 - 708.36] there
[705.90 - 710.34] and my door is open
[708.36 - 712.14] come on in
[710.34 - 714.66] and learn
[712.14 - 716.94] if you guys just got here
[714.66 - 720.18] brain saver brain saver protocols right
[716.94 - 721.28] there 40 off amazon.com us ridiculous
[720.18 - 723.36] price
[721.28 - 726.66] 26.29 dollars
[723.36 - 728.46] heck I saw it on Amazon on on the book
[726.66 - 730.62] page for when you go to brain saver I
[728.46 - 734.16] saw you can buy brain saver brain saver
[730.62 - 737.34] protocols and cleanse the heel for 73
[734.16 - 739.68] dollars it costs 73 dollars it cost more
[737.34 - 741.66] than 73 dollars to even like put one of
[739.68 - 745.20] these books out print it and get it out
[741.66 - 746.76] I just couldn't believe it
[745.20 - 748.20] there's a lot of things I can't believe
[746.76 - 750.18] these days
[748.20 - 751.56] can't believe a lot of things
[750.18 - 753.66] you know
[751.56 - 755.70] can't believe how messed up the world is
[753.66 - 758.22] how people don't have answers out there
[755.70 - 759.36] how I just I can't believe a lot of
[758.22 - 762.48] things
[759.36 - 765.30] symptoms can occur from compromised
[762.48 - 768.24] contaminated neurons so if you've got
[765.30 - 771.78] some contaminated neurons symptoms can
[768.24 - 774.12] occur you ready for this because the
[771.78 - 777.96] brain is sending skewed altered or
[774.12 - 780.18] Twisted messages to the brain stem
[777.96 - 782.10] and then to the cranial nerves if you
[780.18 - 784.38] have a nerve problem a message is coming
[782.10 - 786.84] out of here
[784.38 - 789.00] and then out of your think about if you
[786.84 - 790.80] have a nerve if you have a neuron issue
[789.00 - 793.26] sorry you guys if you have a neuron
[790.80 - 796.68] issue the message is going to get
[793.26 - 799.38] twisted distorted and skewed as it
[796.68 - 801.36] leaves the neuron goes right into the
[799.38 - 802.86] brain stem and then out your cranial
[801.36 - 805.26] nerves and that's why we're like short
[802.86 - 807.78] circuiting we're like sick go into
[805.26 - 810.78] another doctor sick
[807.78 - 810.78] whoa
[810.84 - 816.38] Jess selane thank you Anthony
[813.66 - 819.84] I am having three to four brain shots
[816.38 - 821.22] every day awesome man so proud of you
[819.84 - 823.50] seriously
[821.22 - 825.54] from the brain saver books love them
[823.50 - 827.82] notice they also help with external
[825.54 - 829.62] relationships amazing
[827.82 - 831.60] the thing is with these brain shot
[829.62 - 834.66] therapies Jess is that they're
[831.60 - 837.06] miraculous it's information from above I
[834.66 - 838.92] got warned by SOC that they're going to
[837.06 - 841.08] do all kinds of things for people not
[838.92 - 844.02] just what's directed in the book they
[841.08 - 847.58] have that kind of power
[844.02 - 847.58] to have that kind of power
[849.72 - 853.86] viral nerve and brain stem inflammation
[852.06 - 855.78] so we're talking about
[853.86 - 857.46] brain stem inflammation
[855.78 - 858.60] we're talking about cranial nerve
[857.46 - 860.34] problems
[858.60 - 863.34] so what does this mean
[860.34 - 864.96] let's put it in a nutshell
[863.34 - 867.42] ready
[864.96 - 869.22] oh feel good
[867.42 - 871.02] it's got weird tingles and numbness on
[869.22 - 873.96] my neck and my nose
[871.02 - 876.06] my forehead always feels tight
[873.96 - 877.80] I got blurry vision but the eye doctor
[876.06 - 881.52] says I'm fine
[877.80 - 884.46] I got ticks and spasms all in my face
[881.52 - 887.82] I got crazy brain fog and all kinds of
[884.46 - 889.86] problems my ear hurts really bad I don't
[887.82 - 892.74] know why my jaw hurts but my dentist
[889.86 - 894.36] already removed like two teeth and my
[892.74 - 896.04] jaw still hurts I don't know what this
[894.36 - 897.96] mystery jaw pain is
[896.04 - 900.60] whatever's going on
[897.96 - 903.78] we're talking about viral nerve and
[900.60 - 906.18] brain stem inflammation that's just a
[903.78 - 908.40] fraction of the symptoms conditions if
[906.18 - 910.14] you guys just got here make sure you get
[908.40 - 911.52] these books brain saver brain saver
[910.14 - 913.74] protocols
[911.52 - 915.48] do yourself a favor
[913.74 - 917.94] be prepared though
[915.48 - 919.44] your mind's going to be blown
[917.94 - 920.88] like
[919.44 - 922.80] for real
[920.88 - 924.96] most people with chronic illness don't
[922.80 - 927.18] have physical injuries directly to their
[924.96 - 929.88] cranial nerves that's true
[927.18 - 932.16] not everybody got into a real serious
[929.88 - 934.14] car accident their head went through a
[932.16 - 936.30] windshield not everybody had that happen
[934.14 - 938.76] most people with chronic illness don't
[936.30 - 940.68] have any direct injuries to the cranial
[938.76 - 943.92] nerves
[940.68 - 946.44] but here's what they do have here's what
[943.92 - 948.48] everybody's walking around with chronic
[946.44 - 949.92] viral infections such as Epstein-Barr
[948.48 - 952.10] virus that's the big one right there
[949.92 - 954.72] right that that mm info put out there
[952.10 - 956.82] shingles so many people walk around with
[954.72 - 958.68] shingles
[956.82 - 960.12] and then shingles there's all kinds of
[958.68 - 961.44] crazy stuff you guys know because I'm
[960.12 - 964.62] the one who put the information out of
[961.44 - 967.26] what shingles does herpes simplex one
[964.62 - 969.48] Herpes Simplex 2 was cold sore viruses
[967.26 - 972.30] hit the cranial nerves every time
[969.48 - 975.60] causing problems those cold sore viruses
[972.30 - 978.66] hit the cranial nerves
[975.60 - 982.08] Jackie B the brain saver books have
[978.66 - 984.12] reawakened me to Healing that is
[982.08 - 986.16] incredible I didn't realize how many
[984.12 - 988.50] problems I had until I started to feel
[986.16 - 990.42] better just a few weeks ago by doing the
[988.50 - 993.30] brain shots
[990.42 - 995.28] spread the wisdom around tell people you
[993.30 - 997.38] have to see these books and try these
[995.28 - 1000.80] brain shots
[997.38 - 1002.42] you can put out a miracle
[1000.80 - 1004.82] but yet
[1002.42 - 1007.04] not a lot of people know about it yet
[1004.82 - 1009.80] it's crazy
[1007.04 - 1011.96] Isabelle Brown the Sleep restore shot is
[1009.80 - 1013.76] amazing that's incredible I mean in time
[1011.96 - 1015.68] people will finally get to these books
[1013.76 - 1017.30] but like I said I was naive when I was
[1015.68 - 1019.16] young and I always thought that once you
[1017.30 - 1021.98] have this miraculous answer like these
[1019.16 - 1024.44] books do you think the whole world is
[1021.98 - 1026.78] gonna just do it if I saw the other day
[1024.44 - 1030.02] someone was like yeah I'm in the vegan
[1026.78 - 1032.72] I'm in the vegan movement and a bunch of
[1030.02 - 1034.52] My Vegan friends we don't we don't need
[1032.72 - 1037.70] medical medium
[1034.52 - 1039.74] do you know when you get sick you will
[1037.70 - 1041.78] when you get sick you will
[1039.74 - 1043.46] when you go to 10 doctors you will need
[1041.78 - 1046.12] medical medium books
[1043.46 - 1046.12] you will
[1048.56 - 1053.38] and the answers will be here for free go
[1050.96 - 1053.38] to the library
[1056.48 - 1060.44] you know what's going to be on my
[1057.74 - 1062.30] gravestone my headstone
[1060.44 - 1066.10] everything was for free go to the
[1062.30 - 1066.10] library that'll be on my gravestone
[1070.16 - 1073.82] but really you know
[1071.72 - 1075.32] I don't know I just hope a rocket ship
[1073.82 - 1077.36] lands and
[1075.32 - 1079.64] I just cop on the rocket ship and take
[1077.36 - 1080.54] off and never come back I'd rather do
[1079.64 - 1082.94] that
[1080.54 - 1084.62] all right let's go stop being silly here
[1082.94 - 1086.72] Carolyn
[1084.62 - 1088.94] I could not find any doctor nor a
[1086.72 - 1091.52] neurologist that really understood the
[1088.94 - 1094.64] vagus nerve they don't know much about
[1091.52 - 1097.94] it they don't no matter how much
[1094.64 - 1100.10] symptoms you have or details you give
[1097.94 - 1103.16] them they just don't know what to do
[1100.10 - 1105.08] about it correct they didn't years ago
[1103.16 - 1106.16] when I taught about all this stuff they
[1105.08 - 1109.10] don't now
[1106.16 - 1112.46] and they're knocking in the future
[1109.10 - 1113.96] and if anybody does squeak a peep in the
[1112.46 - 1116.72] future it came from the medical medium
[1113.96 - 1120.08] books it just did I'm not trying to act
[1116.72 - 1122.18] like a jerk it just did it's a fact am I
[1120.08 - 1125.56] not allowed to state that
[1122.18 - 1125.56] that's where it came from
[1125.96 - 1129.86] as you'll read more in detail soon this
[1128.12 - 1132.08] viral inflammation can occur in the
[1129.86 - 1133.52] brain stem so what what I mean there's
[1132.08 - 1134.84] so much information here I'm just
[1133.52 - 1137.36] fooling around as far as this little
[1134.84 - 1139.22] part I'm talking about viral
[1137.36 - 1142.04] inflammation right
[1139.22 - 1147.70] the viruses getting into the brain get
[1142.04 - 1147.70] the neurotoxins affecting the brain stem
[1147.76 - 1152.66] neurotoxins affecting neurons and then
[1150.86 - 1154.70] short-circuit messages come out of your
[1152.66 - 1156.26] cranial nerves
[1154.70 - 1157.76] herpes simplex one the cold sore
[1156.26 - 1159.32] everybody has oh it's just a cold sore
[1157.76 - 1161.00] yeah but it can give you a lot of
[1159.32 - 1164.06] trouble all through the years if you
[1161.00 - 1168.46] don't know how to work on healing it
[1164.06 - 1168.46] the information's here to help us heal
[1169.10 - 1174.16] Uma did you like that one the rocket
[1170.84 - 1174.16] ship okay
[1175.76 - 1180.68] when someone's cranial nerves have been
[1178.46 - 1182.30] temporarily injured for example when
[1180.68 - 1184.52] someone sustains a head injury so if
[1182.30 - 1186.20] someone actually sustains a real head
[1184.52 - 1188.24] injury
[1186.20 - 1190.04] of any kind those cranial nerves won't
[1188.24 - 1192.02] heal so easily if the person has a
[1190.04 - 1193.94] chronic viral infection did you know
[1192.02 - 1195.62] I've seen people and I've taught doctors
[1193.94 - 1199.22] this I've seen people that get a mild
[1195.62 - 1201.62] concussion they go into their car
[1199.22 - 1205.52] they open their car door
[1201.62 - 1208.64] they go down to grab something
[1205.52 - 1210.56] and then they lift their heads up and
[1208.64 - 1212.36] they bang the back of their head right
[1210.56 - 1216.80] on the car door jamb and they're like
[1212.36 - 1220.10] crap oh my God it's just been my head on
[1216.80 - 1222.38] the car door jamb and they got a mild
[1220.10 - 1224.96] concussion
[1222.38 - 1227.00] it should heal perfectly fine
[1224.96 - 1229.16] but if they have low grade viral
[1227.00 - 1232.28] problems chronic low-grade viral
[1229.16 - 1234.86] problems it may not heal so fine so
[1232.28 - 1235.82] check this out and nobody knows this out
[1234.86 - 1238.88] there
[1235.82 - 1241.22] every two lines is packed
[1238.88 - 1243.08] when someone's cranial nerves have been
[1241.22 - 1245.66] temporarily injured for example when
[1243.08 - 1247.76] someone sustains a head injury of any
[1245.66 - 1249.86] kind those cranial nerves won't heal so
[1247.76 - 1252.50] easily if the person has a chronic viral
[1249.86 - 1255.64] infection at the same time every line
[1252.50 - 1255.64] has info here
[1255.68 - 1261.32] I've seen this over and over again with
[1257.78 - 1264.38] people if your viral load is up there
[1261.32 - 1266.62] if you've got the viral load simplex one
[1264.38 - 1270.38] Simplex 2 maybe Epstein-Barr
[1266.62 - 1272.12] cytomegalovirus maybe hhv6 shingles all
[1270.38 - 1274.82] the different rides whatever someone has
[1272.12 - 1276.50] and you bang your head your head may
[1274.82 - 1278.86] take more time to heal than somebody
[1276.50 - 1278.86] else
[1279.32 - 1284.06] injury to a cranial nerve causes tiny
[1282.20 - 1286.28] fibrous root hairs to fray on the area
[1284.06 - 1287.72] of the nerve that was injured if a
[1286.28 - 1289.64] low-grade viral infection such as
[1287.72 - 1291.44] epstein-bar shingles or herpes simplexes
[1289.64 - 1293.00] occurring the virus can attach itself to
[1291.44 - 1295.16] the cranial nerves that are frayed the
[1293.00 - 1296.72] hairs that are afraid now that's way
[1295.16 - 1298.40] ahead of research and science right
[1296.72 - 1301.64] there we're talking they'll never go
[1298.40 - 1304.52] there I mean 100 years maybe maybe even
[1301.64 - 1307.34] longer or never tiny root hairs Fray
[1304.52 - 1308.90] when we have injured cranial nerves so
[1307.34 - 1311.12] then if you have a low-grade viral
[1308.90 - 1313.34] infection like Epstein-Barr a virus can
[1311.12 - 1315.86] literally cling onto a root hair that is
[1313.34 - 1318.20] on the cranial nerve and hence we can
[1315.86 - 1321.82] have all these symptoms
[1318.20 - 1321.82] man they'll never get there
[1322.46 - 1326.72] the virus can station itself in the
[1324.92 - 1329.06] injured part of the nerve and live there
[1326.72 - 1331.46] like lice you don't you ever see lice
[1329.06 - 1332.66] right did anybody ever have lice lice on
[1331.46 - 1335.42] your hair
[1332.66 - 1337.22] do you ever have that before
[1335.42 - 1338.90] a friend of mine got lice and he's like
[1337.22 - 1341.06] what should I do shave my whole head I'm
[1338.90 - 1343.04] like no don't change your whole head we
[1341.06 - 1345.26] can we can figure out how to get rid of
[1343.04 - 1347.60] lice that's not a problem
[1345.26 - 1349.10] friend of mine started shaving half
[1347.60 - 1350.78] their head like I think I got to shave
[1349.10 - 1353.30] my head and shaving half his head I said
[1350.78 - 1355.70] that was stupid why would you do that
[1353.30 - 1358.16] over lice
[1355.70 - 1360.38] there's a comet healing healing apps uh
[1358.16 - 1363.38] I got inflamed cranial nerves and the
[1360.38 - 1365.78] protocol in the new book has helped me a
[1363.38 - 1368.00] lot already incredible
[1365.78 - 1370.90] isn't it isn't it wonderful to know what
[1368.00 - 1370.90] you have wrong
[1371.90 - 1378.16] like if I ever got sick I want to know
[1375.02 - 1378.16] what's wrong with me
[1379.46 - 1382.64] if I ever get sick I want to know what's
[1381.62 - 1384.86] wrong
[1382.64 - 1386.72] of course sfc will tell me but the point
[1384.86 - 1390.74] is that's me but say it was somebody
[1386.72 - 1393.38] else if I ever got sick
[1390.74 - 1395.36] I would want to know what was wrong
[1393.38 - 1398.18] that's all

[1416.90 - 1420.38] so excited to see intracranial
[1418.28 - 1422.72] hypertension in the book
[1420.38 - 1424.76] my sister was labeled years ago with
[1422.72 - 1426.56] that thank you that's incredible I'm
[1424.76 - 1429.32] really happy that you have this
[1426.56 - 1431.78] information seriously
[1429.32 - 1433.52] okay there's so much to go and there's
[1431.78 - 1435.44] so much to talk about here let's just
[1433.52 - 1437.72] pop in anywhere
[1435.44 - 1439.88] untangling the Mysteries can we talk
[1437.72 - 1442.34] about that for a second you guys one
[1439.88 - 1444.14] reason why cranial nerve symptoms are so
[1442.34 - 1446.66] mysterious and misleading to medical
[1444.14 - 1448.76] research in science is that someone can
[1446.66 - 1451.82] have a little bit of everything
[1448.76 - 1454.00] and don't never know
[1451.82 - 1454.00] foreign
[1455.84 - 1460.16] a person could have contamination or
[1458.36 - 1461.96] inflammation in a group of neurons in
[1460.16 - 1464.18] the brain from a source such as toxic
[1461.96 - 1468.40] heavy metals viral neurotoxins which are
[1464.18 - 1472.04] toxins from viruses MSG scented candles
[1468.40 - 1475.34] fragrances air fresheners carpet and
[1472.04 - 1477.14] clothing chemicals tattoos I'm not
[1475.34 - 1480.86] ranking on tattoos
[1477.14 - 1484.10] every time I say the word tattoo people
[1480.86 - 1485.66] want to kill me that's it I've noticed
[1484.10 - 1487.70] out there it's the craziest thing I've
[1485.66 - 1490.64] ever seen
[1487.70 - 1491.72] I'm not ranking at on tattoos I'm just
[1490.64 - 1493.16] saying
[1491.72 - 1496.40] that
[1493.16 - 1497.42] the metal in tattoos and there's no such
[1496.40 - 1500.90] thing
[1497.42 - 1504.74] as vegan ink without metal the reason
[1500.90 - 1507.20] why you can see the color of the tattoo
[1504.74 - 1511.54] through the skin is because light is
[1507.20 - 1511.54] hitting the metal and reflecting
[1511.94 - 1516.80] it all has metal in it that's not what
[1515.00 - 1518.06] I'm here to talk about today though I'm
[1516.80 - 1521.00] just saying
[1518.06 - 1522.86] that a person could have contamination
[1521.00 - 1524.66] or inflammation from a group in a group
[1522.86 - 1526.70] of neurons from all kinds of things have
[1524.66 - 1529.28] toxic heavy metals
[1526.70 - 1531.20] right from you know viral neurotoxes MSG
[1529.28 - 1533.12] sent to candles fragrances air freshers
[1531.20 - 1534.38] carpet clothing chemicals tattoos a
[1533.12 - 1537.08] source of toxic heavy metal
[1534.38 - 1538.64] contamination or caffeine injuries too
[1537.08 - 1540.32] caffeine injuries that's another thing
[1538.64 - 1542.74] people want to beat me to death about is
[1540.32 - 1542.74] caffeine
[1543.32 - 1546.68] at the same time they could have
[1545.06 - 1548.66] inflammation in the lower middle or
[1546.68 - 1549.98] upper brain stem caused by viral
[1548.66 - 1552.38] neurotoxins
[1549.98 - 1554.00] for other problems toxic heavy metals
[1552.38 - 1555.68] and so forth the people can have a lot
[1554.00 - 1559.28] of things they can have brain stem
[1555.68 - 1563.00] issues and sorry some dust going in
[1559.28 - 1565.22] there some brain stem issues and
[1563.00 - 1567.20] they can have also other problems too
[1565.22 - 1568.52] like toxic heavy metals and all kinds of
[1567.20 - 1571.42] different contaminants and all kinds of
[1568.52 - 1571.42] everything else in here
[1571.52 - 1575.54] people can have more than one thing
[1574.10 - 1577.76] wrong
[1575.54 - 1580.22] everybody is different and I talk about
[1577.76 - 1584.48] that in brain saver books
[1580.22 - 1586.94] everybody is different
[1584.48 - 1588.14] you can have one person you can have one
[1586.94 - 1589.34] problem and this other problem another
[1588.14 - 1590.72] person can have this other problem this
[1589.34 - 1593.60] problem that's what these books are here
[1590.72 - 1596.74] for to help you find out what's what and
[1593.60 - 1596.74] what's whatever right
[1599.90 - 1603.38] got a dry throat so I gotta drink a
[1601.58 - 1605.12] little water
[1603.38 - 1607.04] thing is before this I've been talking
[1605.12 - 1609.32] all morning since about six o'clock this
[1607.04 - 1612.86] morning so someone just needs to tell me
[1609.32 - 1614.90] to shut up and be quiet and then
[1612.86 - 1617.80] because literally I don't think I've
[1614.90 - 1617.80] stopped yet today
[1618.80 - 1624.56] all right
[1621.44 - 1626.54] let's go into another little part here a
[1624.56 - 1628.88] vagus nerve can be inflamed at the
[1626.54 - 1632.24] bottom in the abdomen
[1628.88 - 1634.76] so your Vegas nerve can be inflamed down
[1632.24 - 1637.28] here in the abdomen
[1634.76 - 1639.74] one of the vagus nerves can be inflamed
[1637.28 - 1642.10] down here in the abdomen think about
[1639.74 - 1642.10] this
[1646.04 - 1651.02] and in the middle in the chest and yet
[1648.56 - 1652.58] be inflamed higher up at the brainstep
[1651.02 - 1655.28] so here's the thing you can have
[1652.58 - 1658.10] somebody can have inflammation of the
[1655.28 - 1660.20] vagus nerves down low they can have
[1658.10 - 1661.94] inflammation of the vagus nerves up in
[1660.20 - 1663.26] the middle somewhere in the chest they
[1661.94 - 1665.24] can have inflammation of the Vegas
[1663.26 - 1666.98] nerves up in the brain stem think about
[1665.24 - 1669.02] that and the doctor will never know
[1666.98 - 1670.94] there's no MRI there's no brain scan
[1669.02 - 1673.30] there's no nothing no one will ever ever
[1670.94 - 1673.30] know
[1674.12 - 1678.68] Lorraine L I didn't realize how
[1676.40 - 1681.52] difficult my thoughts were until taking
[1678.68 - 1684.08] the obsessive thought shifter less
[1681.52 - 1685.76] catastrophic thinking
[1684.08 - 1688.04] less ruminating
[1685.76 - 1689.78] less focus on the past calmer more
[1688.04 - 1691.70] peaceful that's incredible Lorraine and
[1689.78 - 1693.32] any piece you can get makes me really
[1691.70 - 1696.08] happy
[1693.32 - 1698.44] Becky says what's the brain shots celery
[1696.08 - 1698.44] juices
[1699.98 - 1704.74] [Music]
[1703.00 - 1707.48] uh
[1704.74 - 1710.12] brain shots
[1707.48 - 1713.50] my God
[1710.12 - 1713.50] what's the brain shots
[1713.84 - 1720.32] I just did a 10 day with you guys 10 day
[1717.50 - 1722.90] brain shot therapy cleanse challenge
[1720.32 - 1724.88] I think I said brain shots a thousand
[1722.90 - 1726.98] billion times
[1724.88 - 1730.28] okay to answer that question
[1726.98 - 1733.28] enough with the drama over here
[1730.28 - 1734.54] it's in brain saver books it's a miracle
[1733.28 - 1736.70] tool
[1734.54 - 1738.62] I'm just gonna say everybody heard this
[1736.70 - 1742.46] a thousand times from me be prepared

[1765.50 - 1770.20] some buttons and it's all for free
[1774.28 - 1777.46] all right
[1777.74 - 1781.94] someone could have more inflammation in
[1779.60 - 1783.86] a particular region of the brain skewing
[1781.94 - 1786.34] neuron messages to the brain stem and
[1783.86 - 1786.34] nerves
[1790.64 - 1793.82] which is really interesting too for
[1792.62 - 1795.68] example someone could have more
[1793.82 - 1798.32] inflammation in the left hemisphere of
[1795.68 - 1800.30] the brain or the right hemisphere of the
[1798.32 - 1803.12] brain or in the frontal lobe or
[1800.30 - 1806.36] occipital lobe or temporal lobe or
[1803.12 - 1809.26] Thalamus or cerebellum if inflammation
[1806.36 - 1811.52] is in an endocrine gland
[1809.26 - 1814.34] hypothalamus pineal gland pituitary
[1811.52 - 1817.04] gland didn't that can put pressure on a
[1814.34 - 1818.96] just adjacent brain tissue squeezing the
[1817.04 - 1820.94] neurons in that neighboring brain tissue
[1818.96 - 1824.24] and affecting the messages the neurons
[1820.94 - 1826.16] sent to the brain stem and nerves
[1824.24 - 1827.66] this is way too advanced for the Mayo
[1826.16 - 1828.86] Clinic this is way too advanced for the
[1827.66 - 1830.48] Cleveland Clinic this is way too
[1828.86 - 1831.80] advanced for all of them if you ever
[1830.48 - 1833.14] talk to those doctors because I've
[1831.80 - 1835.40] talked to a bunch of them over the years
[1833.14 - 1836.78] this stuff right here is so over their
[1835.40 - 1838.88] head they just don't even know there's
[1836.78 - 1840.98] like well what's your symptom
[1838.88 - 1843.44] um let's look at our cookbook here of
[1840.98 - 1844.88] crap and see if we can give you way too
[1843.44 - 1847.22] advanced for Harvard
[1844.88 - 1848.06] way too advanced for Harvard Medical all
[1847.22 - 1851.30] of this
[1848.06 - 1853.76] like if you like way too advanced
[1851.30 - 1856.22] all of this information is over the
[1853.76 - 1858.26] heads of all the doctors in Harvard all
[1856.22 - 1860.72] of this like I'm not trying to just be a
[1858.26 - 1862.40] pain I'm just saying it's a fact this
[1860.72 - 1864.56] would blow their mind they wouldn't know
[1862.40 - 1868.76] what to do with it it's way too advanced
[1864.56 - 1868.76] they'd be like wait a minute what
[1872.18 - 1876.82] symptoms of cranial nerve inflammation
[1876.86 - 1881.30] yeah
[1879.38 - 1883.76] oh wait here's a good line the precise
[1881.30 - 1885.86] locations of inflammation varies from
[1883.76 - 1888.44] person to person and can even vary for
[1885.86 - 1890.06] one person over time the majority of the
[1888.44 - 1892.76] time it's inflammation that you can't
[1890.06 - 1894.98] detect in a medical test
[1892.76 - 1897.08] the location where inflammation is
[1894.98 - 1899.00] occurring along specific cranial nerves
[1897.08 - 1901.10] determines the type of symptoms someone
[1899.00 - 1902.96] experiences such as tingles and numbness
[1901.10 - 1904.70] aches and pain stiffness Burning
[1902.96 - 1907.10] Sensations where in the body those
[1904.70 - 1910.04] symptoms occur such as the tongue gums
[1907.10 - 1911.84] the jaw temples back of the neck between
[1910.04 - 1914.00] the eyes back of the head top of the
[1911.84 - 1916.16] head chest or stomach and what body
[1914.00 - 1918.38] functions they affect such as swallowing
[1916.16 - 1921.04] peristaltic action or the from the
[1918.38 - 1924.32] intestinal tract
[1921.04 - 1926.30] mysterious cranial nerve symptoms also
[1924.32 - 1927.98] include blurred vision trouble focusing
[1926.30 - 1929.54] the eyes and usual movement of the
[1927.98 - 1930.98] eyeballs including difficulty with
[1929.54 - 1933.38] muscles around the eyes visual
[1930.98 - 1935.84] disturbances jaw pain burning tongue
[1933.38 - 1938.18] neck pain head pain migraines face
[1935.84 - 1940.34] vibrating head vibrating ear popping
[1938.18 - 1942.44] body buzzing humming pulsating
[1940.34 - 1945.20] Sensations in the head burning hot
[1942.44 - 1946.70] feeling with no fever how many times
[1945.20 - 1949.10] have I talked to people who've had that
[1946.70 - 1950.54] balance issues dizziness feelings of
[1949.10 - 1951.76] electrical shock in the head where it's
[1950.54 - 1954.50] like
[1951.76 - 1955.46] loss of the ability to swallow slurred
[1954.50 - 1959.00] speech
[1955.46 - 1961.94] loss of hearing drooping face we know
[1959.00 - 1963.68] that loss of movement of the face pain
[1961.94 - 1966.56] in various areas of the face feeling
[1963.68 - 1968.96] like they have a crooked jaw pulling
[1966.56 - 1970.82] sensation on their face nose eyes or
[1968.96 - 1972.14] forehead twitching that's erratic and
[1970.82 - 1974.60] shifts all around their head and face
[1972.14 - 1977.24] nausea teeth grinding teeth grinding
[1974.60 - 1979.82] I'll say it twice tooth pain gum pain
[1977.24 - 1982.76] difficulty chewing loss of smell loss of
[1979.82 - 1984.50] taste and mystery twitches and itches or
[1982.76 - 1987.26] rashes that don't go away with
[1984.50 - 1988.76] scratching without rashes these and
[1987.26 - 1991.58] other symptoms of cranial nerve
[1988.76 - 1993.80] inflammation can either be caused by
[1991.58 - 1995.78] inflammation somewhere along the cranial
[1993.80 - 1997.70] nerve or by inflammation in the brain
[1995.78 - 2000.10] stem or cranial nerves are attached they
[1997.70 - 2002.02] won't know this anywhere this is so
[2000.10 - 2004.12] Advanced this book I can't even get out
[2002.02 - 2008.80] of cranial nerve inflammation chapter
[2004.12 - 2010.72] chapter six I'm on page 100. Rina
[2008.80 - 2012.76] I was like oh my God after seeing
[2010.72 - 2015.10] stomach flipping in your book
[2012.76 - 2016.96] just flipping right
[2015.10 - 2019.30] who knows anything about that out there
[2016.96 - 2021.88] thank you for finding it in here thought
[2019.30 - 2024.22] it was something only I have and you
[2021.88 - 2027.22] said it is connected with the Vegas Turf
[2024.22 - 2029.86] correct I also suffered
[2027.22 - 2032.92] I also suffered two quite bad vertigos
[2029.86 - 2034.54] in the past vagus nerve again so it
[2032.92 - 2036.70] makes so much sense it is the vagus
[2034.54 - 2039.00] nerve correct Arena it's the vagus
[2036.70 - 2042.36] nerves
[2039.00 - 2042.36] negus nerves
[2046.18 - 2049.36] all right so there's a little paragraph
[2047.68 - 2050.62] here called vagus nerve insights let's
[2049.36 - 2053.58] talk about that a little bit there's so
[2050.62 - 2053.58] much information here
[2054.28 - 2059.32] what you'll hear called the vagus nerve
[2056.80 - 2061.24] is not just one thick nerve that runs
[2059.32 - 2063.58] from one end to the other in a perfect
[2061.24 - 2066.04] line
[2063.58 - 2068.20] check this out
[2066.04 - 2071.32] the vagus nerves are a larger pair of
[2068.20 - 2073.12] nerves plural
[2071.32 - 2075.96] not singular
[2073.12 - 2075.96] plural
[2076.12 - 2080.14] they deserves are a larger pair of
[2077.86 - 2083.44] nerves that leave the head region and
[2080.14 - 2085.00] travel down to the Torso the vagus nerve
[2083.44 - 2087.04] size
[2085.00 - 2089.92] that's a word right there very
[2087.04 - 2092.08] interesting the vagus nerves
[2089.92 - 2094.12] size
[2092.08 - 2096.58] and reach
[2094.12 - 2098.74] make them more complex than shorter
[2096.58 - 2100.18] cranial nerves which is why they deserve
[2098.74 - 2101.74] special attention here which is what
[2100.18 - 2103.42] we're going to give them because we got
[2101.74 - 2106.14] some killer stuff in here about the
[2103.42 - 2106.14] vagus nerve
[2106.42 - 2110.50] Cornelius says my GP told me that it's
[2108.70 - 2112.54] impossible that I have so many different
[2110.50 - 2115.06] symptoms so I stopped talking about my
[2112.54 - 2118.30] symptoms to her I would just mention one
[2115.06 - 2122.16] or two symptoms at a time
[2118.30 - 2122.16] you can have a hundred symptoms
[2122.80 - 2128.44] the reason for medical medium books and
[2124.90 - 2130.12] information is to give people a way out
[2128.44 - 2131.74] it's for people who have been there done
[2130.12 - 2133.72] that tried everything they're seasoned
[2131.74 - 2136.18] they know what's up that's why when you
[2133.72 - 2138.70] get somebody that that sees one of these
[2136.18 - 2140.02] free open classes and they come in and
[2138.70 - 2142.24] they're just like
[2140.02 - 2145.26] um I'm just looking for some apple cider
[2142.24 - 2148.06] vinegar gummies and some collagen powder
[2145.26 - 2150.28] and what's he talking about and it's
[2148.06 - 2152.50] like you just
[2150.28 - 2154.12] you know it's like the Matrix thing all
[2152.50 - 2156.76] over again
[2154.12 - 2158.32] this is really Advanced information for
[2156.76 - 2160.30] people who have been there done that
[2158.32 - 2162.40] they came from hell and back they fought
[2160.30 - 2164.50] their way out they fought their way to
[2162.40 - 2165.94] stay alive and survive all that crap
[2164.50 - 2168.52] they went through no one knows what it's
[2165.94 - 2170.26] like to be in their shoes mm info is for
[2168.52 - 2173.56] really for the sick people who chronic
[2170.26 - 2175.78] Leo who need the information
[2173.56 - 2178.18] says I can't believe I'm still alive
[2175.78 - 2180.88] with all the crap I have inside me and
[2178.18 - 2183.94] what I've been exposed to the body is so
[2180.88 - 2186.40] amazing it is amazing ensues
[2183.94 - 2187.96] when you give your body the answers and
[2186.40 - 2189.46] the things it needs and the resources
[2187.96 - 2192.04] just so many incredible things can
[2189.46 - 2194.76] happen the brain shot therapy therapies
[2192.04 - 2194.76] alone right
[2195.16 - 2201.00] so here's a section of the book called
[2196.96 - 2201.00] the vagus nerve Grapevine
[2201.46 - 2205.72] we think of the vagus nerve structure as
[2203.86 - 2209.22] a grapevine
[2205.72 - 2209.22] like the other cranial nerves
[2209.44 - 2212.88] sorry we can think
[2213.16 - 2218.44] we can think so I crack myself up when I
[2215.56 - 2220.60] read out loud because I'll miss a word
[2218.44 - 2222.64] we can think of the Vegas therm
[2220.60 - 2225.64] structure as a grapevine like the other
[2222.64 - 2228.70] cranial nerves the vagus nerve Grapevine
[2225.64 - 2232.84] is split in two as it leaves the brain
[2228.70 - 2235.92] stem there's two vagus nerves coming out
[2232.84 - 2235.92] of that brain stem
[2237.22 - 2242.02] with those two main Vines branching off
[2239.26 - 2243.76] on their own Pathways one vagus nerve
[2242.02 - 2247.32] vine branch could be inflamed while the
[2243.76 - 2247.32] other vagus nerve is not
[2250.66 - 2254.08] this is a critical part of the human
[2252.40 - 2256.84] design
[2254.08 - 2258.94] however you believe we were designed
[2256.84 - 2262.12] if you believe
[2258.94 - 2264.22] we were a starfish
[2262.12 - 2267.40] crawled out of the ocean
[2264.22 - 2271.44] came a monkey and then a human fine
[2267.40 - 2271.44] that's our design if you believe
[2272.92 - 2278.86] God designed us
[2275.32 - 2280.66] fine if you believe
[2278.86 - 2282.94] we were designed by alien technology
[2280.66 - 2284.80] five if you believe
[2282.94 - 2287.80] we were designed
[2284.80 - 2289.90] by a meteorite just hit the planet and
[2287.80 - 2291.82] we just kind of all just started to
[2289.90 - 2293.44] develop whatever it is that you believe
[2291.82 - 2295.48] right
[2293.44 - 2297.94] we still were designed in such a way
[2295.48 - 2300.46] that's just unbelievable absolutely
[2297.94 - 2302.44] incredible
[2300.46 - 2304.48] one Vegas third vine branch could be
[2302.44 - 2306.40] inflamed where the other one may not be
[2304.48 - 2307.60] inflamed this is the human design and
[2306.40 - 2309.34] this is what's incredible about the
[2307.60 - 2311.92] human design I'll tell you why because
[2309.34 - 2315.10] what that means is you got a chance
[2311.92 - 2317.20] you got a chance this is a critical part
[2315.10 - 2319.90] of the human design that protects us it
[2317.20 - 2321.70] protects us it means that if one of the
[2319.90 - 2323.92] vagus nerves is completely inflamed or
[2321.70 - 2326.92] damaged there may still be a chance of
[2323.92 - 2330.16] survival while the other vagus nerve
[2326.92 - 2331.78] shares its functions that means our
[2330.16 - 2334.12] vagus nerves are talking to each other
[2331.78 - 2335.62] baby and what they're doing is they're
[2334.12 - 2338.44] trying to help each other two Vegas
[2335.62 - 2340.60] nerves for the price of one see
[2338.44 - 2342.04] everybody has two biggest nerves for the
[2340.60 - 2344.44] price of one
[2342.04 - 2346.24] so the point is though if you have one
[2344.44 - 2349.42] injured vagus nerve
[2346.24 - 2352.24] you got a chance
[2349.42 - 2354.94] because the other one that may not be as
[2352.24 - 2358.06] injured is doing its thing it's doing
[2354.94 - 2360.46] all its messaging and hard work and even
[2358.06 - 2363.04] communicating with the damaged one the
[2360.46 - 2366.12] injured one or infected one
[2363.04 - 2366.12] how incredible
[2367.90 - 2374.20] who even knew that
[2370.78 - 2377.02] oh they didn't it's in here
[2374.20 - 2379.30] and getting out of the world now
[2377.02 - 2381.22] medical research and science haven't yet
[2379.30 - 2383.44] discovered all aspects of the vagus
[2381.22 - 2386.74] nerves that's to say the least there are
[2383.44 - 2389.56] still new discoveries to be had
[2386.74 - 2392.14] one future Discovery is vagus nerve
[2389.56 - 2394.42] regeneration vnr
[2392.14 - 2396.28] that is certain parts of the vagus
[2394.42 - 2398.02] nerves can regenerate and regrow
[2396.28 - 2400.92] themselves if the conditions are right
[2398.02 - 2400.92] did you guys hear that
[2403.60 - 2409.86] what
[2405.94 - 2409.86] like I can't get out of this chapter
[2412.06 - 2417.94] they haven't discovered this yet
[2415.72 - 2419.32] it's a discovery they haven't discovered
[2417.94 - 2421.66] yet
[2419.32 - 2423.94] it's in the brain saver book
[2421.66 - 2427.54] from Spirit of compassion
[2423.94 - 2429.34] the prophecies in here are insane
[2427.54 - 2430.84] when you think about how incredible this
[2429.34 - 2433.06] is
[2430.84 - 2435.72] I mean that's a prophecy right there all
[2433.06 - 2435.72] on its own
[2439.48 - 2443.68] one future Discovery let's visit medical
[2442.18 - 2445.42] research and science haven't yet
[2443.68 - 2446.38] discovered all aspects of the vagus
[2445.42 - 2448.30] nerves
[2446.38 - 2449.62] there are still new discoveries to be
[2448.30 - 2451.06] had now remember sitting there at my
[2449.62 - 2452.68] desk
[2451.06 - 2455.38] and spirit of compassion was giving me
[2452.68 - 2457.84] this piece of information and I I was
[2455.38 - 2459.70] just like what
[2457.84 - 2461.32] one future discovery that medical
[2459.70 - 2463.60] research and science haven't discovered
[2461.32 - 2466.18] yet keep that in mind is vagus nerve
[2463.60 - 2468.28] regeneration called vnr
[2466.18 - 2471.28] Spirit of fashion is even prophesizing
[2468.28 - 2474.70] and putting the the letters is V the
[2471.28 - 2474.70] acumen vnr
[2475.54 - 2479.38] what
[2477.82 - 2481.48] yes
[2479.38 - 2483.70] once you read these books you can't go
[2481.48 - 2485.20] back it's like a friend of mine picked
[2483.70 - 2487.54] up an old eat better book from another
[2485.20 - 2490.68] author in health you know like
[2487.54 - 2490.68] well-known author in health
[2491.08 - 2495.16] and
[2492.46 - 2496.78] he said it was like a joke after reading
[2495.16 - 2498.28] into the brain saver books and going
[2496.78 - 2500.08] back he said he couldn't believe it he
[2498.28 - 2502.54] just threw it out
[2500.08 - 2505.36] because he couldn't believe how remedial
[2502.54 - 2507.22] was how literally how advanced these are
[2505.36 - 2509.26] and helpful and what these have compare
[2507.22 - 2512.16] that but it's like with that the medical
[2509.26 - 2512.16] mean books in general
[2512.62 - 2519.58] one future Discovery is Vegas nerve
[2515.56 - 2522.52] regeneration vnr that is certain parts
[2519.58 - 2524.50] of the vagus nerves can regenerate and
[2522.52 - 2526.00] regrow themselves if the conditions are
[2524.50 - 2528.10] right medical research and science don't
[2526.00 - 2530.70] know this but this is a future Discovery
[2528.10 - 2530.70] down the road
[2530.86 - 2535.96] this is a prophecy medical research and
[2533.32 - 2538.24] science will also discover that the
[2535.96 - 2540.96] anatomy of the vagus nerves is not
[2538.24 - 2540.96] definitive
[2541.24 - 2546.58] oh my God
[2543.94 - 2548.62] the vagus nerves are not designed the
[2546.58 - 2550.48] same way in every person for example the
[2548.62 - 2554.38] Vegas their branches don't completely
[2550.48 - 2556.48] connect in the Torso for everybody
[2554.38 - 2559.24] are you kidding me
[2556.48 - 2561.94] in some people the two Vine branches
[2559.24 - 2564.88] merely cross over and touch each other
[2561.94 - 2566.44] not actually connect is it just me that
[2564.88 - 2568.98] thinks this information is that
[2566.44 - 2568.98] incredible
[2575.92 - 2580.66] the vagus nerves also vary in length in
[2578.32 - 2582.64] each person the discovery is going to be
[2580.66 - 2584.38] forced upon the medical industry check
[2582.64 - 2586.02] this out you guys do too and I told you
[2584.38 - 2589.54] this the other day when I read this line
[2586.02 - 2591.82] due to robotic surgeries where robots
[2589.54 - 2593.56] programmed to perform surgery end up
[2591.82 - 2595.84] injuring patients they're going to
[2593.56 - 2597.58] discover that everybody's vagus nerves
[2595.84 - 2599.86] are different because of robotic
[2597.58 - 2603.52] injuries in surgeries
[2599.86 - 2607.24] because you're gonna dial in Vegas nerve
[2603.52 - 2609.52] being just one way in women
[2607.24 - 2611.44] and men and what they're gonna do is
[2609.52 - 2613.18] someone's going to get a robotic surgery
[2611.44 - 2615.34] because they're already doing that and
[2613.18 - 2618.04] the knife on the robot and I'm not doing
[2615.34 - 2620.02] the robot dance is gonna cut the
[2618.04 - 2621.76] machines the robot those kinds they're
[2620.02 - 2624.46] gonna go and it's gonna cut somebody's
[2621.76 - 2626.92] Vegas they're right in half
[2624.46 - 2629.44] and then science of research are going
[2626.92 - 2631.90] to have to realize that all vagus nerves
[2629.44 - 2634.90] aren't the same
[2631.90 - 2634.90] first
[2637.00 - 2640.66] the discovery is going to be forced upon
[2639.10 - 2643.12] the medical industry due to robotic
[2640.66 - 2645.94] surgeries where robots programmed to
[2643.12 - 2648.64] perform surgery end up injuring patients
[2645.94 - 2650.62] vagus nerves because the calculations
[2648.64 - 2651.76] are so unpredictable from person to
[2650.62 - 2653.68] person but they're only going to learn
[2651.76 - 2656.76] that when they do the robotic surgeries
[2653.68 - 2656.76] that they're building now
[2658.18 - 2662.74] medical communities are going to start
[2660.52 - 2666.16] finding out that the vagus nerves length
[2662.74 - 2668.02] growth size and directions of travel are
[2666.16 - 2670.50] not as cookie cutter as previously
[2668.02 - 2670.50] assumed
[2673.14 - 2678.52] Echoes on and on and on the book's
[2675.88 - 2682.18] packed I'm reading out a brain saver 40
[2678.52 - 2682.18] off amazon.com
[2682.78 - 2687.52] right now us but just know this and be
[2686.44 - 2691.42] prepared
[2687.52 - 2692.80] there's answers not only in these books
[2691.42 - 2695.02] but
[2692.80 - 2697.06] it's an Awakening
[2695.02 - 2700.30] and Beyond Awakening
[2697.06 - 2704.94] there are Therapies in these books
[2700.30 - 2709.06] medical medium shock therapies are
[2704.94 - 2711.58] just incredible in these books
[2709.06 - 2714.10] brain shot therapy is incredible that's
[2711.58 - 2716.38] a different therapy right there
[2714.10 - 2720.24] Dana amazing information on Blown Away
[2716.38 - 2720.24] on YouTube thank you for being here
[2721.72 - 2725.26] the vagus nerves are made up of tiny
[2723.64 - 2726.76] strands and strings of nerve cells that
[2725.26 - 2728.98] run through the length of the nerves the
[2726.76 - 2730.36] vagus nerve is not just one solid nerve
[2728.98 - 2732.76] like medical research and science
[2730.36 - 2734.38] believe
[2732.76 - 2735.52] but by the way you guys look out for
[2734.38 - 2738.76] imposters
[2735.52 - 2740.38] you guys on telegram there's like a
[2738.76 - 2742.84] bunch of imposters they're saying it's
[2740.38 - 2745.18] me they're messaging I don't private
[2742.84 - 2748.00] message anybody whatever direct message
[2745.18 - 2749.80] everybody I don't do that but there's
[2748.00 - 2751.36] these imposters they'll direct message
[2749.80 - 2754.24] you they'll private message you whatever
[2751.36 - 2756.28] it is and they'll just be like
[2754.24 - 2757.54] they'll just want to get a combo going
[2756.28 - 2760.72] with you and they're still say it's
[2757.54 - 2762.52] Anthony William it's not it's not me
[2760.72 - 2763.42] on telegram I'm seeing a bunch of it
[2762.52 - 2765.76] lately
[2763.42 - 2767.74] and they'll say hey I do consultations
[2765.76 - 2771.16] no I don't do consultations so the
[2767.74 - 2773.80] imposters did they do all that
[2771.16 - 2775.42] just look out
[2773.80 - 2777.70] I don't want anybody to get hurt by an
[2775.42 - 2779.80] imposter
[2777.70 - 2781.78] because of the vagus nerve size and
[2779.80 - 2784.48] reach when inflammation occurs in the
[2781.78 - 2786.58] brain stem that affects the vagus nerve
[2784.48 - 2788.26] Grapevine the vagus nerve can exhibit a
[2786.58 - 2789.64] wide range of symptoms and this is why
[2788.26 - 2793.30] people
[2789.64 - 2794.92] can have a hundred symptoms and the
[2793.30 - 2796.42] doctors just they don't even know what
[2794.92 - 2798.04] to do about they won't even believe you
[2796.42 - 2800.14] you can't have too many symptoms it's
[2798.04 - 2801.82] like you said earlier there's no way you
[2800.14 - 2803.86] can have that many symptoms no one can
[2801.82 - 2805.42] have 100 symptoms or 50 symptoms or 30
[2803.86 - 2808.30] symptoms there's no way it must be all
[2805.42 - 2811.30] in your head you're a hypochondriac
[2808.30 - 2813.22] really because of the size and the
[2811.30 - 2815.02] differences and the shapes of the vagus
[2813.22 - 2816.04] nerves people could have multiple
[2815.02 - 2819.84] symptoms
[2816.04 - 2819.84] and doctors not realize this
[2819.88 - 2823.38] you guys anyway
[2824.68 - 2829.48] check out the brand saver books I can go
[2827.26 - 2831.88] on for hours to chap this chapter alone
[2829.48 - 2833.68] I can do multiple courses and classes
[2831.88 - 2835.60] that can last a year
[2833.68 - 2837.76] with just this chapter alone cranial
[2835.60 - 2839.68] nerve inflammation
[2837.76 - 2841.18] but it's free and I'm not going to do
[2839.68 - 2843.70] that
[2841.18 - 2845.50] get the books go Library get it for free

[2850.12 - 2853.90] experiencing ask for family members are
[2852.16 - 2855.76] they experiencing the brain shot therapy
[2853.90 - 2859.00] what kind of results they had tell them
[2855.76 - 2862.36] they can post about it do reels about it
[2859.00 - 2865.00] right and share their stories about it
[2862.36 - 2867.34] and tag at Medical medium hashtag
[2865.00 - 2869.08] medical medium so I can see it and make
[2867.34 - 2870.82] sure that I can post it and stuff so let
