[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.64] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.68] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.64 - 53.48] Williams we're talking about nature you
[47.68 - 58.48] know birds bees grass trees rivers
[53.48 - 60.68] oceans the sky and how it heals our soul
[58.48 - 63.00] and physical body too
[60.68 - 64.92] you know nature you've seen it before
[63.00 - 67.52] but have you seen it do you pay
[64.92 - 70.28] attention you might be too busy so many
[67.52 - 74.16] people are do you see a bee land on a
[70.28 - 76.20] flower and do you give it a minute this
[74.16 - 78.16] is going to be an incredible episode I
[76.20 - 80.20] don't want you to miss this hang on for
[78.16 - 82.12] the ride cuz we're talking about how
[80.20 - 86.64] nature heals
[82.12 - 88.84] us nature comes in all shapes and sizes
[86.64 - 90.80] what that means is maybe someone has
[88.84 - 93.28] just a little tiny
[90.80 - 96.48] backyard maybe they have a little tiny
[93.28 - 99.52] front yard maybe they only have one
[96.48 - 101.48] window in their house or their apartment
[99.52 - 105.40] or dwelling somewhere and they can just
[101.48 - 109.08] see one tree and then once in a while
[105.40 - 111.24] they see a bird land on that tree or a
[109.08 - 115.88] squirrel go up the
[111.24 - 120.56] tree nature can be as small as being on
[115.88 - 123.44] a rooftop in the city watching a pigeon
[120.56 - 125.96] on another rooftop and the nature could
[123.44 - 127.48] be a lot bigger than that it could be
[125.96 - 131.32] somebody who's always outdoors and
[127.48 - 134.32] taking hikes taking walks every day out
[131.32 - 137.16] there by the ocean standing on the
[134.32 - 141.16] beach camping out by a
[137.16 - 143.48] lake nature can come in all shapes and
[141.16 - 145.12] sizes but do we know what nature is
[143.48 - 148.96] really doing for
[145.12 - 150.48] us yeah it's winding us down helping us
[148.96 - 154.16] relax
[150.48 - 157.20] maybe shifting our train of thought
[154.16 - 160.24] giving us a break some
[157.20 - 163.60] relaxation but it could be doing a lot
[160.24 - 167.24] more for you than you even know and if
[163.60 - 169.84] you harness it properly or just right
[167.24 - 172.36] you can get a lot more out of it when it
[169.84 - 173.40] comes down to Nature anything and
[172.36 - 176.68] everything
[173.40 - 179.84] goes it can be simplistic it can be just
[176.68 - 182.40] listening to a cricket and each individ
[179.84 - 184.64] ual thing you experience in nature does
[182.40 - 185.96] something a little different to vastly
[184.64 - 188.88] different for
[185.96 - 191.84] you if you're in the wilderness and
[188.88 - 194.80] you're camped out and a Sasquatch walks
[191.84 - 197.84] by you're a nature and it's going to do
[194.80 - 200.40] something for you it's probably going to
[197.84 - 202.44] scare the hell out of you but
[200.40 - 205.68] something's going to happen because
[202.44 - 207.88] there it is a creature in the
[205.68 - 211.08] woods same thing if you're in the
[207.88 - 214.96] wilderness and you see a bear walk by
[211.08 - 218.40] or if you see a squirrel on a branch
[214.96 - 221.88] they all do different things for us in
[218.40 - 223.40] different ways they ignite healing they
[221.88 - 227.04] ignite
[223.40 - 228.80] emotion they help our soul so let's
[227.04 - 231.96] start heading into it right
[228.80 - 234.88] now life can be really toxic down here
[231.96 - 237.64] on Earth we can get exposed to a lot of
[234.88 - 240.00] different things not just
[237.64 - 242.80] toxins not just different things that
[240.00 - 245.72] are poisonous to us but different things
[242.80 - 249.40] that are poisonous to us yeah what that
[245.72 - 252.56] means is other people's emotions psychic
[249.40 - 255.44] attacks any kind of betrayal or trust
[252.56 - 258.92] breakage jealousy issues that you run
[255.44 - 261.16] into people with stress all the
[258.92 - 264.08] different moving parts to be here on
[261.16 - 266.72] planet Earth Financial stress everything
[264.08 - 269.84] stress it's here this place can be
[266.72 - 271.76] really toxic so there has to be a flip
[269.84 - 274.44] side there has to be something that's
[271.76 - 277.68] working in our favor that we can utilize
[274.44 - 279.52] to balance this madness down here
[277.68 - 281.52] there's experiences down here in planet
[279.52 - 286.20] Earth that hurt our
[281.52 - 288.72] heads it just hurts our heads lots of
[286.20 - 291.04] annoyances things that shouldn't be
[288.72 - 293.16] happening but they just are there's a
[291.04 - 296.20] lot of Darkness on planet Earth you see
[293.16 - 298.24] it out there all kinds of Wars for what
[296.20 - 300.28] reason all kinds of different problems
[298.24 - 303.96] out there for what reason
[300.28 - 306.28] and then the monetary system and then
[303.96 - 308.32] everything else including the Illuminati
[306.28 - 310.80] and what's happening there all of it
[308.32 - 315.24] puppeteering and controlling everything
[310.80 - 317.56] offer greed and chaos and sickness and
[315.24 - 320.16] the system it's set up to make people
[317.56 - 321.84] sick we know that already so while all
[320.16 - 324.68] this is happening out there and the
[321.84 - 326.76] world is spinning and all these
[324.68 - 328.68] different poisons and toxins are
[326.76 - 330.88] traveling through the air and their
[328.68 - 333.24] inner hands on on us we breathe them in
[330.88 - 335.76] we eat them and then all the different
[333.24 - 338.24] stress factors involved we have to
[335.76 - 341.92] utilize everything we
[338.24 - 345.68] have what constraints and what system is
[341.92 - 348.72] a toad living with what constraints and
[345.68 - 353.04] what system is a bee living with a
[348.72 - 356.48] squirrel a flower growing a river
[353.04 - 360.72] flowing what are these held back with
[356.48 - 364.84] what kind of roles are placed on these
[360.72 - 367.60] animals insects that have any roles are
[364.84 - 369.48] they worried about a monetary system are
[367.60 - 371.84] they worried about some kind of stress
[369.48 - 375.60] factor are they worried about someone
[371.84 - 378.92] screaming at them Someone putting rules
[375.60 - 381.28] at them someone telling them to wait in
[378.92 - 383.20] line for a postage stamp are they
[381.28 - 385.44] worried about something they're not
[383.20 - 387.44] worried about really anything they're
[385.44 - 389.92] just doing what they need to do and they
[387.44 - 393.64] have an energy and a frequency they're
[389.92 - 397.00] doing it what's governing
[393.64 - 399.64] nature the laws of nature that's what's
[397.00 - 403.88] governing nature they live by the laws
[399.64 - 406.88] of nature it's not the laws of men it's
[403.88 - 410.00] the laws of nature huge
[406.88 - 410.92] difference some say the laws of nature
[410.00 - 413.84] are
[410.92 - 417.24] harsher you know you see it on
[413.84 - 420.64] YouTube you see it in the movies you see
[417.24 - 422.36] a shark come out of the water
[420.64 - 425.20] grab onto a
[422.36 - 427.40] seal pull the poor thing down into the
[425.20 - 431.40] water and blood flowing
[427.40 - 433.76] everywhere you see a lion chasing after
[431.40 - 436.20] an antelope taking it down and ripping
[433.76 - 440.08] it apart you see a
[436.20 - 442.92] crocodile taking a swim going after a
[440.08 - 446.32] whole flock of birds just gobbling them
[442.92 - 449.56] up feathers everywhere you see nature
[446.32 - 450.76] portray it like that and yes it's there
[449.56 - 454.68] it
[450.76 - 458.24] happens but our world that governs us is
[454.68 - 462.40] a lot more scarier and more
[458.24 - 465.84] evil it's actually evil in so many ways
[462.40 - 468.24] and it's set up like that nature is
[465.84 - 471.08] nature it's dog eat
[468.24 - 475.92] dog but life on planet Earth for
[471.08 - 479.60] humankind is dog Slaughter dog a tiger
[475.92 - 481.24] chases a rabbit for survival
[479.60 - 484.56] it's
[481.24 - 487.48] survival a human does a diabolical thing
[484.56 - 492.04] to another human or group of humans or
[487.48 - 493.96] large massive group of humans for sport
[492.04 - 496.96] and hatred and
[493.96 - 500.40] jealousy but in animal trying to survive
[496.96 - 504.52] out there like a wolf or a group of
[500.40 - 508.08] wolves hunting mice in a cold field
[504.52 - 510.00] before winter comes there's no jealousy
[508.08 - 512.80] there's no hatred
[510.00 - 514.08] it's just get a mouse in the stomach to
[512.80 - 519.00] survive the
[514.08 - 523.44] winter get a mouse in your mouth chew it
[519.00 - 527.08] up swallow it so life can
[523.44 - 530.16] continue big difference the greed the
[527.08 - 531.92] hatred the jealousy the Betrayal the
[530.16 - 534.52] trust breakage on this
[531.92 - 536.32] planet is getting to its
[534.52 - 538.44] maximum it's
[536.32 - 541.08] climbing it's
[538.44 - 544.84] elevating and that gets into our
[541.08 - 548.76] Consciousness it can contaminate us it
[544.84 - 550.76] can poison our brains poison our minds
[548.76 - 552.40] or Consciousness or subconsciousness
[550.76 - 556.56] poison our
[552.40 - 559.52] souls and so we need something to shift
[556.56 - 562.12] that we need to fill the
[559.52 - 564.00] garden we need to pull the poisonous
[562.12 - 566.68] weeds out of the garden and we need to
[564.00 - 570.28] fill the garden with edible
[566.68 - 573.08] plants we need something to visualize
[570.28 - 574.40] something to see something that could be
[573.08 - 577.48] really
[574.40 - 581.68] healing like maybe a
[577.48 - 583.44] worm a worm can be very healing if you
[581.68 - 587.60] take a little shovel and you're digging
[583.44 - 590.12] it in the garden or you're just digging
[587.60 - 593.12] in the leaves somewhere and you see an
[590.12 - 595.40] earthworm pop out and squiggle
[593.12 - 597.44] away there's something that happens when
[595.40 - 600.04] you see that worm squiggling
[597.44 - 603.32] away your soul
[600.04 - 604.44] a little portal in your soul just opens
[603.32 - 608.64] right
[604.44 - 611.00] up your brain cells and neurons start to
[608.64 - 613.40] receive the information you're seeing an
[611.00 - 616.24] imprint is being made
[613.40 - 619.08] instantly and as you're looking at that
[616.24 - 621.24] earthworm a miracle is
[619.08 - 623.52] happening information that's sitting
[621.24 - 626.60] inside your brain and your neurons
[623.52 - 628.68] starts to move information that may not
[626.60 - 632.16] be good that's sitting in the emotional
[628.68 - 635.16] centers of the brain like experiences
[632.16 - 637.16] stressful experiences old ones too going
[635.16 - 641.08] all the way back new ones that were just
[637.16 - 645.16] the other day or some that have been
[641.08 - 647.60] PTSD or created PTSD long ago and they
[645.16 - 651.00] just surface every now and then and
[647.60 - 654.44] Trigger those start to move along
[651.00 - 657.36] too and it's not just one
[654.44 - 660.72] earthworm it can be a potato
[657.36 - 663.72] bug it can be a any kind of creepy
[660.72 - 665.40] Crawley that you see move around in the
[663.72 - 669.40] dirt or under the
[665.40 - 672.28] leaves and then you hear a flutter a
[669.40 - 676.56] little flutter and it's a bird it's
[672.28 - 679.36] moving pretty quick there it is it lands
[676.56 - 683.60] on a branch you look up at it and take a
[679.36 - 686.96] good look at it and have respect for it
[683.60 - 689.88] what happens is that in our busy lives
[686.96 - 693.44] these things become old hat
[689.88 - 696.68] old hat we just don't respect it like we
[693.44 - 700.40] should and we don't really receive what
[696.68 - 703.48] it really is and what it could do for us
[700.40 - 705.48] we ignore it sometimes too there's
[703.48 - 708.24] people out there that maybe with a
[705.48 - 710.72] family member or a friend they go on a
[708.24 - 714.08] hike but they're not really seeing
[710.72 - 716.56] anything they're not really taking it in
[714.08 - 719.24] digesting it it's helping them it's
[716.56 - 722.04] helping them heal but they're not taking
[719.24 - 724.24] taking it all in and receiving it they
[722.04 - 727.80] got other things on their mind or they
[724.24 - 732.64] feel it's just underneath them beneath
[727.80 - 736.28] them it's not important compared to
[732.64 - 739.60] life but it is important and it is
[736.28 - 743.12] critical to see and understand when you
[739.60 - 746.68] lean up against a tree and you touch it
[743.12 - 749.84] and place your hand on that tree realize
[746.68 - 753.32] something that there is water living
[749.84 - 754.32] water filled with minerals coming up
[753.32 - 758.72] from the
[754.32 - 760.60] earth and going up traveling up right
[758.72 - 763.76] behind that bark
[760.60 - 768.40] layer so when you put your hand on that
[763.76 - 771.04] tree that's its life force that's its
[768.40 - 772.84] heartbeat the tree's heartbeat isn't in
[771.04 - 775.96] the middle of the tree the tree's
[772.84 - 779.80] heartbeat is actually just under that
[775.96 - 783.28] thin veil of bark
[779.80 - 786.28] it's right there you're feeling it's
[783.28 - 790.56] blood you're feeling it's
[786.28 - 792.16] fluid you're feeling it's living force
[790.56 - 794.80] and living
[792.16 - 797.92] Source something happens to that
[794.80 - 800.68] tree if that bark is cut all the way
[797.92 - 804.20] around the tree even if it's just an
[800.68 - 806.88] inch into the tree all the way around it
[804.20 - 810.12] can't get that drink anymore it'll still
[806.88 - 812.36] look green but eventually the tree will
[810.12 - 815.08] just die and all the leaves will turn
[812.36 - 819.20] brown and crumble and eventually just
[815.08 - 822.88] fall off because life force is rushing
[819.20 - 826.76] up through the underneath layer of the
[822.88 - 829.24] bark so when people hug trees and they
[826.76 - 831.76] like to hug trees and it's very healing
[829.24 - 834.32] and it's good for them what's really
[831.76 - 836.88] happening is they're wrapping their body
[834.32 - 839.52] around the trees's life force which is
[836.88 - 841.40] just underneath the bark
[839.52 - 843.32] but the key is to really get this to
[841.40 - 845.64] settle in and work for you when you
[843.32 - 847.00] touch a tree or be near a tree is to
[845.64 - 849.76] know that's what's
[847.00 - 852.44] happening because a rewiring
[849.76 - 855.36] occurs nature
[852.44 - 856.48] rewires and that includes every aspect
[855.36 - 858.72] of
[856.48 - 861.88] nature if you're standing next to that
[858.72 - 864.12] tree and you know that that water is
[861.88 - 866.80] Flowing that that's the veins of the
[864.12 - 868.64] tree and it's flowing upward and that
[866.80 - 871.28] tree is drinking that water for its
[868.64 - 874.60] survival and you become conscious of it
[871.28 - 877.40] aware of it then you go to the next
[874.60 - 880.16] level it's not just looking at a tree
[877.40 - 883.92] it's more than that it's understanding
[880.16 - 886.68] the tree's existence and life force and
[883.92 - 887.80] when you understand that the tree will
[886.68 - 893.60] connect to
[887.80 - 896.40] you A tree can connect to a human
[893.60 - 900.24] being why would a tree grow
[896.40 - 902.48] fruit why would a tree grow avocado
[900.24 - 904.48] one of the reasons A Tree Grows avocados
[902.48 - 907.04] it isn't just for the squirrels to eat
[904.48 - 908.36] them and raccoons to eat them when they
[907.04 - 913.08] fall to the
[908.36 - 917.76] ground it's for humans to eat and
[913.08 - 920.00] survive that fruit is grown for
[917.76 - 923.08] humankind so think about that for a
[920.00 - 926.24] minute that tree is doing us more than
[923.08 - 929.88] just a favor it's supporting our life
[926.24 - 932.64] force it's giving us a food a
[929.88 - 935.36] staple when that tree grows a
[932.64 - 936.44] pomegranate it's giving us that food in
[935.36 - 940.48] that
[936.44 - 944.08] staple and so the food is growing for us
[940.48 - 946.64] the tree is growing it for us it knows
[944.08 - 950.72] then it's
[946.64 - 953.64] eaters trees no it's eaters when a
[950.72 - 957.72] squirrel is on that tree trying to take
[953.64 - 960.32] down a pomegranate the tree knows that
[957.72 - 964.28] it's growing a food for that
[960.32 - 966.04] squirrel and so there's a symbiotic
[964.28 - 969.28] relationship
[966.04 - 972.20] developing it's always there so when you
[969.28 - 974.36] go up to a tree the tree knows that
[972.20 - 976.36] you're part of
[974.36 - 979.76] everything and then when you become
[976.36 - 983.24] aware of this though the rewiring really
[979.76 - 985.32] kicks in and deep healing occurs because
[983.24 - 987.92] you're not just thinking about oh what
[985.32 - 990.28] do I got going on today what am I doing
[987.92 - 991.76] today oh my God my stress is so bad oh
[990.28 - 994.36] I'm going to stand next to this tree and
[991.76 - 996.96] absorb this nature but wow lots going on
[994.36 - 1000.00] the minute you switch out of that and
[996.96 - 1002.44] you're just like wow the water is coming
[1000.00 - 1004.56] from the earth it's going up the tree
[1002.44 - 1008.28] the bark I can put my hand on the side
[1004.56 - 1012.08] of the bark I'm touching its vein path
[1008.28 - 1014.12] its artery path and when you do that the
[1012.08 - 1016.72] wiring and the rewiring just starts to
[1014.12 - 1020.64] go into high gear versus just low gear
[1016.72 - 1024.52] now anything in nature helps to rewire
[1020.64 - 1026.48] even looking at a painting of nature is
[1024.52 - 1028.96] healing there's a lot of different
[1026.48 - 1031.64] people out there different kinds of
[1028.96 - 1034.76] people some people are
[1031.64 - 1038.28] compassionate some people are just blood
[1034.76 - 1042.76] suckers some people are just energy
[1038.28 - 1045.64] suckers some people it's all about what
[1042.76 - 1048.36] I can give you if you give me something
[1045.64 - 1049.56] it's all about trading some people it's
[1048.36 - 1052.36] just all about
[1049.56 - 1054.56] bartering barter and barter and
[1052.36 - 1057.00] barter I'm not judging any of these
[1054.56 - 1058.68] people or any of the people that live
[1057.00 - 1062.52] like a certain way or any way they want
[1058.68 - 1066.72] to live that's our freedom it's our free
[1062.52 - 1069.56] will but a lot of people out there like
[1066.72 - 1071.56] to draw from
[1069.56 - 1075.56] people energy
[1071.56 - 1078.96] suckers they devour energy off the
[1075.56 - 1082.24] person and what happens in nature it
[1078.96 - 1085.92] doesn't work like that that grasshopper
[1082.24 - 1088.32] is not going to take from you it's not
[1085.92 - 1090.24] going to draw anything from you it's
[1088.32 - 1091.28] going to do the opposite it's going to
[1090.24 - 1093.72] offer
[1091.28 - 1097.28] something that Cricket is not going to
[1093.72 - 1103.64] draw from you and take from you it's not
[1097.28 - 1106.40] a blood sucker it's not a emotional well
[1103.64 - 1110.44] Digger it's not anything of the
[1106.40 - 1113.12] sort it's there to offer
[1110.44 - 1114.84] something a squirrel is not going to
[1113.12 - 1115.92] take from you unless you want to give it
[1114.84 - 1118.96] a
[1115.92 - 1120.96] nut unless you want to hand it a nut out
[1118.96 - 1122.48] of your own hand which is really healing
[1120.96 - 1123.92] for a lot of people but look out the
[1122.48 - 1125.60] squirrel might get spooked and get
[1123.92 - 1128.32] squirrly and take a little nibble out of
[1125.60 - 1129.80] your hand and take a little bite they
[1128.32 - 1131.92] got to be
[1129.80 - 1135.44] cautious but a squirrel might want to
[1131.92 - 1138.52] get a peanut from you but the squirrel
[1135.44 - 1141.32] gives you something back in return for
[1138.52 - 1143.12] that peanut squirrel's not going to be
[1141.32 - 1145.28] an energy
[1143.12 - 1148.32] sucker a squirrel is going to be an
[1145.28 - 1152.56] energy Giver in a way that's much
[1148.32 - 1152.56] different you might not feel
[1154.68 - 1160.00] sparkierdust of
[1157.40 - 1162.56] reasons that you're going to be
[1160.00 - 1163.88] rewired your brain is going to be
[1162.56 - 1166.04] functioning
[1163.88 - 1168.36] differently just from that experience
[1166.04 - 1171.52] with a squirrel just looking at the
[1168.36 - 1174.80] squirrel on a tree watching its pattern
[1171.52 - 1176.84] what it does how it rubs its face with
[1174.80 - 1180.68] its little Claws and
[1176.84 - 1183.20] hands how it looks around real fast and
[1180.68 - 1187.00] then takes off chases other squirrels
[1183.20 - 1189.32] and plays all around the tree I remember
[1187.00 - 1193.36] when I was younger taking a walk through
[1189.32 - 1196.72] the woods in an area I've never been I
[1193.36 - 1198.76] climbed up a hill and there was some
[1196.72 - 1201.76] water running
[1198.76 - 1204.16] it was a spring and it was
[1201.76 - 1205.40] flowing now the miracle thing was we
[1204.16 - 1208.00] were in a
[1205.40 - 1210.92] drought there was no water really all
[1208.00 - 1213.72] the ponds and lakes were down at their
[1210.92 - 1218.76] lowest didn't rain for
[1213.72 - 1221.68] months birds were searching for water
[1218.76 - 1223.08] everywhere it was not a good time it was
[1221.68 - 1227.00] a serious
[1223.08 - 1229.96] drought but there was just water flowing
[1227.00 - 1233.72] down this little Hill
[1229.96 - 1238.12] it was miraculous just to see it and to
[1233.72 - 1240.40] listen to it I sat down Sat by it and I
[1238.12 - 1245.80] listened to it and I watched it
[1240.40 - 1248.80] flow and S so said to me this is healing
[1245.80 - 1250.40] your soul I said well it feels like it's
[1248.80 - 1254.52] healing my soul there's something
[1250.40 - 1257.24] happening here and so so said no
[1254.52 - 1261.40] listen every single
[1257.24 - 1264.24] Trickle and everything you see is
[1261.40 - 1265.80] forming a memory and imprint that will
[1264.24 - 1269.44] be there forever and you will never
[1265.80 - 1272.64] forget it and it's entering through a
[1269.44 - 1275.28] passageway into your soul I'll never
[1272.64 - 1279.64] forget that I'll never forget that
[1275.28 - 1282.00] moment it's with me in this lifetime
[1279.64 - 1285.56] forever and spirit of compassion tells
[1282.00 - 1288.16] me I'm taking it far beyond this
[1285.56 - 1289.64] lifetime it's going to be in there as a
[1288.16 - 1293.48] protect Ive
[1289.64 - 1294.80] measure a healing measure to help me
[1293.48 - 1298.16] stay
[1294.80 - 1300.76] strong and that's how powerful nature
[1298.16 - 1302.16] is if you're somebody you're not afraid
[1300.76 - 1305.04] of
[1302.16 - 1306.92] bees because you're just not afraid
[1305.04 - 1309.20] maybe you've never had a
[1306.92 - 1312.92] reaction maybe you never even had a bee
[1309.20 - 1315.80] sting before and you see a bee on a
[1312.92 - 1318.24] flower and you drop down to the ground
[1315.80 - 1322.20] and you just look at it maybe it's a
[1318.24 - 1323.80] honey maybe and it's on the top of a
[1322.20 - 1326.04] dandelion
[1323.80 - 1329.76] flower and you're listening to it and
[1326.04 - 1331.12] you're watching it is gathering up all
[1329.76 - 1333.80] that
[1331.12 - 1337.60] pollen and you take a good look and you
[1333.80 - 1341.04] listen and it enters into the soul deep
[1337.60 - 1344.88] into the soul and you can see Blades of
[1341.04 - 1347.08] grass going around the dandelion flower
[1344.88 - 1349.24] I can see the bee effortlessly just
[1347.08 - 1352.96] floating up and down
[1349.24 - 1354.92] and then it decides to take off it's
[1352.96 - 1357.60] looking for another flower
[1354.92 - 1360.48] somewhere at the same time here comes
[1357.60 - 1361.84] another bee lands on the same flower
[1360.48 - 1366.20] that one just
[1361.84 - 1369.24] left it's these memories these
[1366.20 - 1372.36] experiences these references they become
[1369.24 - 1376.24] references that hold a lot of power and
[1372.36 - 1378.04] our healing and maybe you don't have
[1376.24 - 1379.68] access to any of it and you're just
[1378.04 - 1381.68] sitting inside the house and you're
[1379.68 - 1385.16] looking at a
[1381.68 - 1388.08] painting there's power in even a
[1385.16 - 1393.20] naturistic painting that you can see
[1388.08 - 1395.24] flowers and trees and blue skies and
[1393.20 - 1398.44] water very
[1395.24 - 1400.88] healing healing on the brain
[1398.44 - 1404.44] subconsciousness the Consciousness the
[1400.88 - 1405.76] soul mentally emotionally spiritually
[1404.44 - 1408.52] and even
[1405.76 - 1410.76] physically even if you're somebody that
[1408.52 - 1413.72] that's in a city or you're chronically
[1410.76 - 1416.20] sick and you can't get outside it's too
[1413.72 - 1419.56] hard or you don't have the resources but
[1416.20 - 1423.12] you can look out of a window and you can
[1419.56 - 1427.44] see a bird passing by you could see it
[1423.12 - 1430.40] rain in the raindrops hit the window see
[1427.44 - 1433.56] the raindrops landing on the grass or on
[1430.40 - 1435.48] the trees or in the parking
[1433.56 - 1438.20] lot
[1435.48 - 1439.16] anything anything in nature is helpful
[1438.20 - 1442.80] and and
[1439.16 - 1444.48] healing watching a cloud roll in if
[1442.80 - 1448.28] you're somebody that can go outside and
[1444.48 - 1449.72] lay on a lawn or in a park on the ground
[1448.28 - 1453.52] or a grassy
[1449.72 - 1455.76] field and you can look up at the sky and
[1453.52 - 1457.60] see the dragon flies and maybe that's
[1455.76 - 1459.20] not the type of season or the time of
[1457.60 - 1461.84] season that's happening right now for
[1459.20 - 1464.40] you but maybe you'll get that chance and
[1461.84 - 1466.40] you'll see the dragon flies Roll On
[1464.40 - 1469.76] by as they
[1466.40 - 1472.00] go dragon flies
[1469.76 - 1476.00] highly connected to
[1472.00 - 1479.44] humankind and help the brain heal and
[1476.00 - 1482.36] the Soul heal in many different
[1479.44 - 1484.92] ways and so dragon flies going by and
[1482.36 - 1487.64] then birds flying up high in the
[1484.92 - 1491.68] sky and trees
[1487.64 - 1495.44] rustling and do other things besides C
[1491.68 - 1498.04] make sure you listen and hear and then
[1495.44 - 1500.48] feel if you have the opportunity to just
[1498.04 - 1503.80] sit there on the
[1500.48 - 1507.80] ground and just play with little twigs
[1503.80 - 1509.44] and pull grass up from the earth and
[1507.80 - 1512.92] touch the
[1509.44 - 1516.20] grass just that alone is so healing and
[1512.92 - 1517.68] so powerful creates references that help
[1516.20 - 1521.36] battle chronic
[1517.68 - 1524.40] illness and help battle emotional abuse
[1521.36 - 1527.16] emotional pain betrayal any kind of
[1524.40 - 1529.68] problems that have happened in your life
[1527.16 - 1533.76] being let down trust
[1529.68 - 1537.24] breakage these very Tools in nature help
[1533.76 - 1538.72] to reverse that help to heal it
[1537.24 - 1541.40] especially if it's happening on a
[1538.72 - 1543.60] continual basis maybe you're in a
[1541.40 - 1547.68] relationship and there's a lot of
[1543.60 - 1549.08] distrust in the relationship betrayal
[1547.68 - 1551.12] and all kinds of
[1549.08 - 1553.48] aggravation compromises that are
[1551.12 - 1554.56] happening between the relationship for
[1553.48 - 1557.36] some
[1554.56 - 1560.08] reason and so it's a constant battle or
[1557.36 - 1562.08] a constant ARG arent or fight getting
[1560.08 - 1565.44] into nature in
[1562.08 - 1569.52] between critical to clear the Sate or
[1565.44 - 1571.64] help clear the Sate help ease things
[1569.52 - 1575.08] especially if you feel like your soul is
[1571.64 - 1578.04] taking on water it's like a boat out
[1575.08 - 1580.88] there and the waters get rough and
[1578.04 - 1584.20] there's a storm coming and the boat's
[1580.88 - 1587.20] rocking and water's coming onto the boat
[1584.20 - 1591.44] it's taking on water and it's feeling
[1587.20 - 1593.28] heavy even when a soul can feel heavy
[1591.44 - 1596.40] feeling like it's been beaten or
[1593.28 - 1600.12] battered by distress alone or anything
[1596.40 - 1602.00] happening in your life nature is a
[1600.12 - 1607.08] weapon against
[1602.00 - 1610.08] it nature can help get that boat
[1607.08 - 1613.64] floating get the Seas to
[1610.08 - 1615.48] come get the water out of the boat when
[1613.64 - 1618.44] we go through life we feel like we're on
[1615.48 - 1620.76] somebody else's playing field
[1618.44 - 1623.84] let's face it it's that difficult down
[1620.76 - 1628.44] here and we're on someone else's playing
[1623.84 - 1632.32] field out there when you get into nature
[1628.44 - 1633.76] it's on your playing field now nature is
[1632.32 - 1637.60] your playing
[1633.76 - 1641.24] field you get to be in nature in
[1637.60 - 1644.28] peace you get to see it feel it take it
[1641.24 - 1646.60] in for what it is evildoers on the
[1644.28 - 1650.20] planet don't want you Tak it in
[1646.60 - 1652.64] nature they just want to destroy nature
[1650.20 - 1655.76] they do it all the time or they just
[1652.64 - 1659.52] want to withhold nature that's why most
[1655.76 - 1663.12] of the planet isn't accessible to people
[1659.52 - 1665.72] meaning it's restricted land it's off
[1663.12 - 1668.24] limits you're allowed to play in Parks
[1665.72 - 1672.32] you're allowed to take hikes in Parks
[1668.24 - 1674.92] visit national parks and state parks but
[1672.32 - 1677.96] there's so much land and so much nature
[1674.92 - 1680.28] people are not allowed to enjoy or see
[1677.96 - 1683.56] it's it's controlled it's kept from
[1680.28 - 1685.72] people but you don't need to do the big
[1683.56 - 1688.00] nature thing if it's not something that
[1685.72 - 1691.32] you have time for resources or energy
[1688.00 - 1694.56] for it can be as simple as your own yard
[1691.32 - 1697.60] your own backyard your friend's backyard
[1694.56 - 1701.60] anywhere anyhow it could be this small
[1697.60 - 1704.40] little tiny Island not an island out in
[1701.60 - 1707.20] the sea but an island near your house or
[1704.40 - 1709.76] your apartment meaning a little spot
[1707.20 - 1712.44] that has a few trees trees and some
[1709.76 - 1715.60] grass and if you sat there just for a
[1712.44 - 1717.76] few minutes even for 3 minutes you can
[1715.60 - 1720.48] take in what nature offers and you might
[1717.76 - 1723.80] see something that surprises you you
[1720.48 - 1726.96] might see an insect or a bird or a hawk
[1723.80 - 1729.56] fly by and that's the power of nature no
[1726.96 - 1732.20] matter what we can use it for our own
[1729.56 - 1735.52] benefit whenever we need it we can look
[1732.20 - 1738.64] in the sky we can take a deep breath we
[1735.52 - 1742.16] can breathe in air into our lungs we can
[1738.64 - 1744.44] connect to the water sources around us
[1742.16 - 1746.48] to the Lakes the rivers the oceans and
[1744.44 - 1749.80] maybe only once a year you get to an
[1746.48 - 1752.20] ocean and you can walk on that sand and
[1749.80 - 1754.04] experience like the medical medium waves
[1752.20 - 1756.28] on a beach
[1754.04 - 1758.44] meditation and you can experience that
[1756.28 - 1761.20] once and then you have that reference
[1758.44 - 1763.72] and it stays with you a lifetime and it
[1761.20 - 1766.68] stays in your soul and it sits there and
[1763.72 - 1768.84] it doesn't leave nobody can take it from
[1766.68 - 1772.44] you it can't be
[1768.84 - 1774.88] stolen it can't leave you you're not
[1772.44 - 1777.92] going to get let down you're not going
[1774.88 - 1780.12] to get your trust broken that experience
[1777.92 - 1782.08] is going to sit inside your soul and
[1780.12 - 1784.56] your neurons and your brain and your
[1782.08 - 1786.88] emotional centers of the brain for a
[1784.56 - 1790.20] lifetime and Beyond and it's going to
[1786.88 - 1792.92] help protect you and help you heal
[1790.20 - 1794.68] nature is so powerful for healing that
[1792.92 - 1798.20] if you couldn't get out and you can only
