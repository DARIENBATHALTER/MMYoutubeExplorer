[220.92 - 225.12] you're like one of those 3:00 in the
[223.80 - 227.56] afternoon and it hits you and you're
[225.12 - 228.60] like all right I gone far enough maybe
[227.56 - 232.96] you're a
[228.60 - 236.08] 4:00 maybe you're like 6 maybe you're 8
[232.96 - 238.16] to 4 68 who do we appreciate the
[236.08 - 240.32] caffeine right that's what we really
[238.16 - 243.28] appreciate is the caffeine
[240.32 - 243.28] because without
[243.64 - 248.76] it the crazy thing with the caffeine
[246.28 - 251.92] part with
[248.76 - 253.56] it same thing but it's just another day
[251.92 - 255.28] what happens is we get that high we get
[253.56 - 257.60] that high and by the end of the day
[255.28 - 260.36] we're coming down we're coming down and
[257.60 - 262.24] then we got to Gorge we got to eat what
[260.36 - 264.64] do you like to eat oh you're a healthy
[262.24 - 267.52] one right you're a healthy person you're
[264.64 - 269.48] doing like the salad and the protein and
[267.52 - 271.08] lean protein and the vegetable and you
[269.48 - 273.92] got it all together at night when you're
[271.08 - 276.00] doing it friend of mine it's like all
[273.92 - 277.92] Pizza Man the end of the day he's like I
[276.00 - 280.48] waited for this I earned the right for
[277.92 - 282.56] this pizza man then he just gobbles the
[280.48 - 284.76] whole thing down but everybody's got a
[282.56 - 286.28] Different Twist you know some people
[284.76 - 288.96] like to eat differently at the end of
[286.28 - 292.56] the day some people do like more like
[288.96 - 295.64] 4:00 then they'll do it again at like 7
[292.56 - 297.84] but they went till 4:00 without eating
[295.64 - 300.16] and that's a feat waiting to 4:00 when
[297.84 - 302.24] you think about it one of of the things
[300.16 - 305.72] that's a head scratcher for me this is a
[302.24 - 308.20] big one right here it was a guy thing to
[305.72 - 310.24] start is kind of funny right
[308.20 - 312.76] intermittent fasting wasn't a girl's
[310.24 - 314.84] thing it was a dude's thing you know
[312.76 - 317.80] dudes that never had a health problem
[314.84 - 319.04] dudes that never been sick dudes that
[317.80 - 321.68] don't know what it's like to have
[319.04 - 324.08] chronic illness you know like aches and
[321.68 - 326.36] pains and fatigue and blurriness and
[324.08 - 329.80] dizziness and all kinds of different
[326.36 - 332.04] problems just wanted to get like more in
[329.80 - 333.52] shape in the fact of like losing their
[332.04 - 335.76] belly a little bit the intermittent
[333.52 - 338.96] fasting thing didn't start with women
[335.76 - 342.32] who are chronically sick because let's
[338.96 - 345.36] face it if a woman's really sick and
[342.32 - 347.08] they don't eat until 6: at night not
[345.36 - 349.32] only are their adrenals going to go down
[347.08 - 351.04] for the count their blood sugar is going
[349.32 - 352.48] to drop they're not going to be able to
[351.04 - 354.04] function they're not going to be able to
[352.48 - 356.04] walk they won't be able to drive they
[354.04 - 359.48] won't get glucose to the brain blood
[356.04 - 362.12] sugar to the brain they'll just be shot
[359.48 - 364.76] so it started out like with a dude that
[362.12 - 366.88] wasn't sick so it's like a dude thing
[364.76 - 368.24] and the crazy thing is when these things
[366.88 - 371.28] keep on getting out of hand in the
[368.24 - 374.92] trendy world all of a sudden everybody's
[371.28 - 377.44] doing it and then no one's keeping track
[374.92 - 380.52] of the downfall The Fallout the
[377.44 - 383.76] casualties no one's watching any of that
[380.52 - 387.64] no one's seeing someone who shouldn't be
[383.76 - 390.28] doing that does it and they get hurt
[387.64 - 392.00] right and that's just the obvious direct
[390.28 - 393.36] hurt that comes across right at the
[392.00 - 395.40] beginning of somebody doing it when
[393.36 - 397.64] they're not well I'm not talking about
[395.40 - 400.68] someone who's healthy enough strong
[397.64 - 403.44] enough can work out they do it for one
[400.68 - 404.80] year two year three year four year and
[403.44 - 407.52] then all of a sudden their hair's all
[404.80 - 408.84] falling out and all of a sudden they got
[407.52 - 411.28] fatigue that's
[408.84 - 413.64] unexplainable and all of a sudden
[411.28 - 416.28] they're getting waking when they're
[413.64 - 417.92] sitting there eating hardly anything
[416.28 - 419.72] everything just starts falling apart
[417.92 - 421.88] that's Fallout that comes years l later
[419.72 - 423.36] for a healthy woman right that
[421.88 - 424.96] intermittent fast you don't think it's
[423.36 - 428.56] happening
[424.96 - 430.72] oh I see it all the time out there and
[428.56 - 433.16] so do a lot of doctors I talk to so do a
[430.72 - 434.84] lot of people I talk to it's out there
[433.16 - 436.92] it's happening but remember it started
[434.84 - 439.60] out with like healthy dudes like strong
[436.92 - 442.48] dudes that decided to stop eating bacon
[439.60 - 444.28] and eggs and sausage in the morning
[442.48 - 446.88] they're like you know what I'm kind of
[444.28 - 449.68] done with the six eggs in the morning
[446.88 - 451.68] and the sausage and the bacon and and
[449.68 - 453.12] you know I tried not to do the toast
[451.68 - 454.92] anymore I got rid of that and I just
[453.12 - 457.80] started doing my protein breakfast which
[454.92 - 461.36] was the egg two slices of ham around it
[457.80 - 463.32] or sausage and egg Patty with no bread
[461.36 - 465.40] but eventually it was a dude thing where
[463.32 - 467.92] was like no I'm just not going to eat
[465.40 - 471.00] this heavy meal in the morning and I'm
[467.92 - 474.16] just going to fast and it kind of got my
[471.00 - 476.52] tummy down so it was a guy thing all
[474.16 - 479.56] along and now you got women who haven't
[476.52 - 481.60] been sick yet writing books doing things
[479.56 - 486.00] doing podcasts teaching other women to
[481.60 - 487.28] do it but no one's saying you can do it
[486.00 - 489.72] for a little while because you'll
[487.28 - 491.52] probably get away with it if you do it
[489.72 - 493.24] you're going to be sick down the road
[491.52 - 496.76] and if you do it you're going down for
[493.24 - 499.32] the count that month no one's monitoring
[496.76 - 501.24] any of that no one's looking at any of
[499.32 - 504.92] that because remember it's one siiz fits
[501.24 - 507.52] all out there every time it's one siiz
[504.92 - 509.64] fits all intermittent fasting one siiz
[507.52 - 511.76] fits all no one's looking at all the
[509.64 - 513.72] subtleties and how everybody's different
[511.76 - 516.16] it's always one siiz fits-all in all the
[513.72 - 518.60] Alternative Health world it's painful
[516.16 - 521.24] but true that's getting you upset I'm
[518.60 - 523.12] sorry but it's the truth I want to ask
[521.24 - 526.52] you something is there any moms
[523.12 - 529.56] listening right now um would you let
[526.52 - 532.44] your daughter not eat the whole entire
[529.56 - 534.80] day until 600 or 8:00 at night on
[532.44 - 538.12] espresso all day long not eating
[534.80 - 540.36] anything would that be a smart idea cuz
[538.12 - 543.96] I'm scratching my head over here would
[540.36 - 547.48] you let your son do the same thing n e
[543.96 - 550.16] the whole entire day hey Michael um

[616.76 - 620.52] children like what we do should be good
[619.28 - 623.16] for our children right because they're
[620.52 - 627.76] learning from us yeah I mean that's what
[623.16 - 630.04] they're doing it's like um yeah Mommy is
[627.76 - 634.60] not going to eat

[664.48 - 669.36] she just does these different diets and
[665.96 - 671.80] stuff like that yeah no I want you
[669.36 - 673.16] Britney you should eat today yeah that's
[671.80 - 675.36] actually really important because you
[673.16 - 677.68] know how your blood sugar gets a little
[675.36 - 679.64] kind of crazy and your blood sugar's
[677.68 - 682.64] like off and remember when you were like
[679.64 - 685.92] faint in gym class no you have to eat
[682.64 - 688.72] something okay yeah I know you want to
[685.92 - 690.48] do what Mommy wants to do I get it but
[688.72 - 693.80] yeah but mommy has to do this this is
[690.48 - 695.28] what she has to do for herself okay or
[693.80 - 698.00] how about if you're taking your child to
[695.28 - 700.52] the doctor so you're taking your child
[698.00 - 704.64] to the doctor and the doctor
[700.52 - 706.88] says uh Mrs Cooper we're going to do
[704.64 - 708.72] interment fasting for your daughter
[706.88 - 711.96] she's getting some weight so she's
[708.72 - 715.88] gaining weight and we want her to start
[711.96 - 718.24] eating at 6 every day so we like this
[715.88 - 720.12] organic coffee let's make sure that your
[718.24 - 722.32] daughter's using this organic coffee all
[720.12 - 724.08] day long and she doesn't eat because
[722.32 - 728.48] we're going to do the intermittent
[724.08 - 730.96] fasting the expert way and she can eat
[728.48 - 733.32] anything she ever wanted at night I
[730.96 - 737.52] don't care what it is ice cream Mrs
[733.32 - 741.00] Cooper um macaroni and cheese pizza do
[737.52 - 744.20] you like pizza Daphne do you like pizza
[741.00 - 746.88] she okay great pizza's perfect uh dapan
[744.20 - 749.28] you like pizza perfect pizza party every
[746.88 - 752.68] night Mrs Cooper at your house but she's
[749.28 - 755.76] not allowed to eat the entire day but
[752.68 - 757.48] she has to drink some coffee and you can
[755.76 - 759.08] teach her how to drink coffee you and
[757.48 - 761.88] your husband drink coffee every single
[759.08 - 763.64] day so this is the new program we're
[761.88 - 765.76] kind of doing here so I think it would
[763.64 - 767.56] be a great idea we get her on CU she's
[765.76 - 770.92] she's she's gaining a little weight we
[767.56 - 772.96] want to lose that weight you know what's
[770.92 - 776.64] weird I'm
[772.96 - 779.12] detecting eating disorder oh my God like
[776.64 - 782.08] when I think about it I'm like starting
[779.12 - 785.12] to have visions of Eating Disorders all
[782.08 - 788.04] through my head is it just me am I just
[785.12 - 791.32] being crazy or something but I'm like
[788.04 - 794.44] I'm smelling an eating disorder like I'm
[791.32 - 799.12] seeing an eating disorder more than
[794.44 - 800.36] that this is like eating disorder land
[799.12 - 802.68] when you think about it right now I'm
[800.36 - 804.96] just thinking about it now just by doing
[802.68 - 807.84] this and talking to you
[804.96 - 810.68] guys I feel like I've developed an
[807.84 - 813.68] eating disorder just from this alone all
[810.68 - 815.08] right let's be honest we're talking like
[813.68 - 817.04] that can create a serious eating
[815.08 - 819.80] disorder right all right you don't
[817.04 - 822.48] believe me okay do you know how many
[819.80 - 824.28] people were taken away locked up taken
[822.48 - 826.60] away in a Patty wagon because they
[824.28 - 830.48] didn't want to eat do you know how many
[826.60 - 833.12] teenage girls were locked up taken away
[830.48 - 835.12] given ECT because of it do you know how
[833.12 - 838.20] many people were hurt throughout the
[835.12 - 841.44] years and years and years unfairly
[838.20 - 845.48] terribly unfairly in an evil way
[841.44 - 849.16] actually but not eating all day long
[845.48 - 851.96] would warrant an instant label of an
[849.16 - 855.52] eating disorder a mental condition for a
[851.96 - 859.04] young person the parents be freaking out
[855.52 - 862.28] the mom would be just in total disarray
[859.04 - 865.04] it would uproot an entire family
[862.28 - 867.80] Calamity would ensue they would take
[865.04 - 870.48] kids away they'd be seeing counselors
[867.80 - 873.00] after counselors after counselors if
[870.48 - 875.96] your teenager daughter teenager son
[873.00 - 878.88] wouldn't eat and wanted to do this kind
[875.96 - 882.88] of thing but because now it's fake
[878.88 - 884.80] science approved and it's the trend and
[882.88 - 887.60] people are doing it it's all of a sudden
[884.80 - 890.00] accept it oh my god when I think about
[887.60 - 893.32] it how many kids were taken away from
[890.00 - 895.76] their families families destroyed
[893.32 - 900.16] children's lives ruined when I think
[895.76 - 903.32] about that custody losses of children
[900.16 - 906.16] all of that because you know they
[903.32 - 909.08] weren't eating which is terrible because
[906.16 - 912.00] they shouldn't have been taken away so
[909.08 - 914.04] many of these families destroyed so many
[912.00 - 917.52] problems it's not easy in the eating
[914.04 - 920.12] disorder World a lot of tragedies happen
[917.52 - 922.84] in different ways but how much how many
[920.12 - 926.16] drugs and medications that children were
[922.84 - 927.32] put on teenagers were put on like
[926.16 - 930.60] dangerous
[927.32 - 932.68] drugs because they had an eing disorder
[930.60 - 936.20] and then when I think about like
[932.68 - 939.04] intermittent fasting is everywhere it's
[936.20 - 941.00] everywhere it's on every magazine it's
[939.04 - 942.44] all over the Internet of course doctors
[941.00 - 946.32] are preaching and teaching about it
[942.44 - 949.24] every day right you see it everywhere
[946.32 - 951.56] books out this out influencers doing it
[949.24 - 953.24] all the time it's flooded the entire
[951.56 - 955.36] system podcasts there's all these
[953.24 - 957.48] podcasts about it all on its own when
[955.36 - 959.32] you think about that all the young
[957.48 - 962.16] people are seeing this
[959.32 - 964.40] everywhere they're seeing it on social
[962.16 - 966.20] media they're seeing it on the internet
[964.40 - 968.76] they're seeing it on TV they're seeing
[966.20 - 970.20] it in movies it's just all over the
[968.76 - 972.76] place it's perfectly fine it's just
[970.20 - 974.80] intermittent fasting oh it must be solid
[972.76 - 977.64] with science everything must be perfect
[974.80 - 981.36] with it yeah no just don't eat as long
[977.64 - 983.24] as you don't eat and don't eat just
[981.36 - 985.80] don't eat that's the message see what I
[983.24 - 989.44] mean it's you can't go it's not like eat
[985.80 - 992.96] it's don't eat don't eat don't eat and
[989.44 - 996.00] whoa no you're a loser you broke your
[992.96 - 999.48] intermittent fast at 1:00 you better try
[996.00 - 1001.64] harder you get kind of mental about it
[999.48 - 1003.36] what about the OCD based around it I
[1001.64 - 1005.64] mean think about that you start getting
[1003.36 - 1007.84] into this whole pattern of you start
[1005.64 - 1010.80] hating on yourself how do I know I've
[1007.84 - 1013.08] seen it out there young people hating
[1010.80 - 1015.64] their own guts hating themselves
[1013.08 - 1018.48] thinking they're crap because they broke
[1015.64 - 1022.16] their intermittent fasting day at 1:00
[1018.48 - 1024.08] or at 2:00 in the afternoon or at 12:00
[1022.16 - 1026.20] and they gobbled something down because
[1024.08 - 1027.84] no one's really teaching them it's not
[1026.20 - 1029.72] the best thing to do there's other ways
[1027.84 - 1032.20] to do it and they end up gobbling
[1029.72 - 1034.88] something down at 2:00 and they feel
[1032.20 - 1037.12] like failures and then they go into a
[1034.88 - 1038.84] depression but no one's talking about
[1037.12 - 1041.04] this it's like we're always worried
[1038.84 - 1042.88] about our children not eating we're
[1041.04 - 1044.52] always worried about eating disorders
[1042.88 - 1046.96] there's a history of that out there so
[1044.52 - 1050.04] let's just create a billion more Eating
[1046.96 - 1053.28] Disorders but make it seem like it's an
[1050.04 - 1055.80] okay thing it's perfectly fine to do
[1053.28 - 1058.84] everybody's doing it it's science
[1055.80 - 1060.96] suggested or there's experts everywhere
[1058.84 - 1063.36] there's dudes there's women they're
[1060.96 - 1066.04] experts now at it they're teaching about
[1063.36 - 1069.04] it health coaches nutritionists oh why
[1066.04 - 1071.00] don't you try intermittent fasting maybe
[1069.04 - 1073.56] your son can try intermittent fasting
[1071.00 - 1075.24] too maybe both of you guys can do it oh
[1073.56 - 1078.04] what's the best way to do it make sure
[1075.24 - 1079.08] you're doing caffeine all day and don't
[1078.04 - 1084.56] eat
[1079.08 - 1087.52] anything it sounds insane because it is
[1084.56 - 1090.72] and we get numb that's how it works here
[1087.52 - 1093.80] you get numb to punishment you get numb
[1090.72 - 1096.48] to stupid things that are happening you
[1093.80 - 1099.08] get numb you just get used to it like
[1096.48 - 1102.20] you don't know it's happening anymore
[1099.08 - 1105.60] you just become with it part of it you
[1102.20 - 1109.08] just let it happen you it just you coast
[1105.60 - 1112.20] along with it no one sees it no one sees
[1109.08 - 1115.80] anything wrong in it no one thinks of it
[1112.20 - 1116.68] as anything it just naturally evolves
[1115.80 - 1118.40] into
[1116.68 - 1121.76] something
[1118.40 - 1123.64] spooky and evil but it doesn't matter
[1121.76 - 1125.72] because you can't see it cuz you're
[1123.64 - 1128.16] blind you got eyes but you can't see and
[1125.72 - 1129.84] it's just you just go along with it and
[1128.16 - 1130.72] then everybody goes along with it and it
[1129.84 - 1133.68] never
[1130.72 - 1136.48] stops and then just stick a name like
[1133.68 - 1140.52] science on it somehow like license it
[1136.48 - 1142.64] license it by giving it the science okay
[1140.52 - 1145.32] because there was some kind of BS study
[1142.64 - 1149.52] that wasn't a study that monitored five
[1145.32 - 1152.68] people for a certain amount of time but
[1149.52 - 1154.60] then never monitored them at all in the
[1152.68 - 1156.52] future to what happened to them to what
[1154.60 - 1158.96] they're doing now to maybe how things
[1156.52 - 1161.16] have gone wrong and everything else and
[1158.96 - 1163.92] I notice they're always monitoring
[1161.16 - 1166.28] somebody who has no illness or no
[1163.92 - 1169.00] serious illness like neurological
[1166.28 - 1172.64] illness like Tremors and Shakes
[1169.00 - 1174.88] severe fatigue brain fog blurry vision
[1172.64 - 1177.76] like all of it combined tingles numbness
[1174.88 - 1179.68] on the body weakness of the limbs all
[1177.76 - 1183.28] kinds of different body pain everywhere
[1179.68 - 1185.44] jaw pain neck pain all of this severe
[1183.28 - 1187.64] insomnia they don't use any of those
[1185.44 - 1190.48] people because if you starve those
[1187.64 - 1192.96] people they're going down their body
[1190.48 - 1194.04] won't be able to handle it you know
[1192.96 - 1196.36] we're talking about people that are
[1194.04 - 1198.48] bedridden too let's add that in say
[1196.36 - 1200.88] somebody's bedridden or spends a lot of
[1198.48 - 1203.24] time on mattress Island you take
[1200.88 - 1205.00] somebody on mattress Island who's
[1203.24 - 1207.88] struggling even a young person on
[1205.00 - 1210.00] mattress Island who struggling and they
[1207.88 - 1211.72] only have a few good hours a day where
[1210.00 - 1214.28] they can kind of function enough the
[1211.72 - 1216.16] rest is they have to just rest and you
[1214.28 - 1218.36] take all their food away till 6:00 or 7
[1216.16 - 1221.52] at night and they give them a big old
[1218.36 - 1223.64] sloppy greasy fat meal afterwards
[1221.52 - 1225.40] they're going to get really sick
[1223.64 - 1227.64] adrenals are going to be gone nervous
[1225.40 - 1230.40] system is going to be gone they're just
[1227.64 - 1233.32] gonna have it much harder but they're
[1230.40 - 1235.04] not using those people if it was so
[1233.32 - 1237.80] great if intermittent fasting was so
[1235.04 - 1241.08] great you guys wouldn't it get the real
[1237.80 - 1245.04] sick better it doesn't get the real sick
[1241.08 - 1248.88] better but it's for the not sick or
[1245.04 - 1251.60] someone who's got like A1C is up there
[1248.88 - 1253.80] or they got like maybe type 2 diabetes
[1251.60 - 1256.76] pre-diabetes right they're not really
[1253.80 - 1258.32] sick they just need to back off those
[1256.76 - 1260.44] big fatty meals in the morning which
[1258.32 - 1263.36] we're going to go into detail but in the
[1260.44 - 1266.20] end it doesn't make them better better
[1263.36 - 1268.88] down the road or maybe they're not sick
[1266.20 - 1270.68] but they got some weight on them or they
[1268.88 - 1273.68] not only have some weight on them the
[1270.68 - 1275.04] cholesterols up a little bit but they
[1273.68 - 1276.96] can go and go and go they're not
[1275.04 - 1278.64] bedridden they're not on mattress island
[1276.96 - 1280.88] with mysterious chronic illness
[1278.64 - 1282.44] neurological conditions they're not
[1280.88 - 1283.88] suffering or struggling they're not
[1282.44 - 1287.28] dealing with severe fatigue they're
[1283.88 - 1289.04] living their life they're healthy except
[1287.28 - 1291.36] they got some stuff going on but they're
[1289.04 - 1293.40] basically healthy they just been living
[1291.36 - 1295.24] off the lamb you know eating too much in
[1293.40 - 1297.56] the morning all these years sausage
[1295.24 - 1300.20] bacon eggs you know fast food
[1297.56 - 1303.16] restaurants greasy fried food in the
[1300.20 - 1305.64] morning you know egg sandwiches every
[1303.16 - 1307.20] single morning or just something heavy
[1305.64 - 1309.72] in the morning like lots of fat in the
[1307.20 - 1312.36] morning butter like butter heart attack
[1309.72 - 1314.40] butter and they're bloated they've been
[1312.36 - 1318.36] eating a big breakfast every day for
[1314.40 - 1320.08] many years or eating a big greasy lunch
[1318.36 - 1322.52] all these years they have a doughnut in
[1320.08 - 1324.60] the morning a cookie in the morning a
[1322.52 - 1326.88] coffee and then at lunchtime they have
[1324.60 - 1329.28] some greasy thing or some fast food or a
[1326.88 - 1331.40] meat sandwich or a deli sandwich it just
[1329.28 - 1334.16] catches up to you after a while and I
[1331.40 - 1336.76] noticed that these intermittent fasters
[1334.16 - 1339.92] they always start a vigorous exercise
[1336.76 - 1342.20] program at the same time as they cut out
[1339.92 - 1343.88] all that heavy grease in the morning but
[1342.20 - 1345.60] take somebody who's chronically ill
[1343.88 - 1349.60] who's on mattress Island even a young
[1345.60 - 1352.52] person they can't exercise hardly anyway
[1349.60 - 1354.72] they're really sick you take their food
[1352.52 - 1357.52] away they're going to
[1354.72 - 1359.16] suffer they're going to suffer greatly
[1357.52 - 1362.16] and sure someone who's on mattress
[1359.16 - 1364.48] Island shouldn't be on eggs and bacon in
[1362.16 - 1366.92] the morning and grease and have greasy
[1364.48 - 1369.96] fatty meals during the day and pizza for
[1366.92 - 1372.12] lunch of course not but the point is his
[1369.96 - 1375.48] intermittent fasting World believes any
[1372.12 - 1378.36] food in the morning any kind healthy or
[1375.48 - 1380.92] not including fruit makes it so you're
[1378.36 - 1383.28] not intermittent fasting so the messages
[1380.92 - 1385.52] don't even do a healthy meal in the
[1383.28 - 1386.88] morning so that person who's on mattress
[1385.52 - 1389.88] Island and that young person who's
[1386.88 - 1392.88] really sick gets the message whoa I'm
[1389.88 - 1394.76] not supposed to eat anything I just
[1392.88 - 1396.52] can't eat anything and everybody seems
[1394.76 - 1398.96] to be getting so much better on the
[1396.52 - 1403.00] intermittent fasting so I better try
[1398.96 - 1405.44] this because that 42-year-old dude that
[1403.00 - 1408.12] never had a problem who can exercise in
[1405.44 - 1410.92] the gym all day and drink all the coffee
[1408.12 - 1412.96] wants he's doing it and he seems to be
[1410.92 - 1416.08] an expert cuz look at his little
[1412.96 - 1418.40] magazine article or his interview on a
[1416.08 - 1420.48] podcast and no one's accounting for
[1418.40 - 1423.60] really what's going on because remember
[1420.48 - 1426.84] it's one size fits all inter fasting is
[1423.60 - 1429.28] a hack that's why it's for a dude that
[1426.84 - 1432.64] never was really that sick who finally
[1429.28 - 1436.36] cleans up his diet and decides exercise
[1432.64 - 1438.64] or a woman who cleans up her diet never
[1436.36 - 1441.72] had any real health problems
[1438.64 - 1444.68] you know can handle like 90° heat no
[1441.72 - 1446.84] problem can go part of the day without
[1444.68 - 1449.28] eating no problem at all drinks whatever
[1446.84 - 1451.80] they want drinks alcohol at night
[1449.28 - 1453.88] exercises when they want and decides to
[1451.80 - 1455.68] clean up their act like I want to live a
[1453.88 - 1458.64] healthier life I'm gaining a couple of
[1455.68 - 1461.44] pounds and I'm getting a little bloated
[1458.64 - 1463.92] you go on the hack the intermittent
[1461.44 - 1466.64] fasting hack where you starve yourself
[1463.92 - 1468.52] drink coffee have a meal at night whoa
[1466.64 - 1470.16] floating going down a little a bit hey I
[1468.52 - 1472.52] could still exercise for an hour in the
[1470.16 - 1474.36] gym this is working out okay it's the
[1472.52 - 1478.08] ultimate hack for the nons so sick
[1474.36 - 1480.32] person or the not sick person meanwhile
[1478.08 - 1483.08] when you're really chronically sick it
[1480.32 - 1486.00] makes you sicker and sicker and sicker
[1483.08 - 1487.84] so someone would say wait a minute okay
[1486.00 - 1490.48] someone who's chronically sick gets
[1487.84 - 1495.64] sicker from this then why am I getting
[1490.48 - 1498.52] better from this Oh no you're improving
[1495.64 - 1502.64] from the hack at first you'll pay the
[1498.52 - 1504.68] price later it's already happened you'll
[1502.64 - 1506.84] see and I'm going to cover that now
[1504.68 - 1509.04] there's an Empire or Empires built on
[1506.84 - 1512.32] intermittent fasting when Empires get
[1509.04 - 1514.12] built and Believe Me Empires when
[1512.32 - 1517.12] they're getting built and built and
[1514.12 - 1519.60] built they throw every single term they
[1517.12 - 1523.04] could and every single scientific term
[1519.60 - 1526.56] and everything catchphrase you name it
[1523.04 - 1528.68] into it it becomes a monster out there
[1526.56 - 1532.32] and then it's built
[1528.68 - 1534.52] on the backs of the chronically ill
[1532.32 - 1536.32] because the chronically ill doesn't heal
[1534.52 - 1539.64] from it doesn't help them it's not
[1536.32 - 1541.52] serving them it's not serving the people
[1539.64 - 1544.80] who are really down and out struggling
[1541.52 - 1547.52] trying to survive all it's doing is
[1544.80 - 1550.08] getting some people who overindulged
[1547.52 - 1553.92] their whole life many of them just had
[1550.08 - 1556.16] it made gained a few pounds wanted to
[1553.92 - 1559.08] exercise wanted to drop some of their
[1556.16 - 1561.76] bad habits and pushed them forward a
[1559.08 - 1563.68] little bit that's great and all but what
[1561.76 - 1565.44] about the chronically sick what about
[1563.68 - 1567.88] the chronically ill what about the
[1565.44 - 1570.04] people who are really suffering what
[1567.88 - 1572.64] about the wave of chronic illness that's
[1570.04 - 1574.44] developing right now in this world what
[1572.64 - 1576.56] about the chronic Le watching all the
[1574.44 - 1579.76] propaganda out there on intermittent
[1576.56 - 1582.52] fasting watching all the not so sick
[1579.76 - 1584.96] people who throw out those glowing
[1582.52 - 1588.24] reviews on how their weight went down
[1584.96 - 1591.32] and they're feeling more energetic and
[1588.24 - 1593.64] their Skin's a little better meanwhile
[1591.32 - 1596.16] they were just people that weren't that
[1593.64 - 1598.72] sick but the chronically ill they get
[1596.16 - 1601.60] sucked into this because they're
[1598.72 - 1604.80] thinking they're just as sick as they
[1601.60 - 1606.68] are but it's not true when people have
[1604.80 - 1610.32] tingles and numbness and aches and pains
[1606.68 - 1612.36] and burning skin on fire severe insomnia
[1610.32 - 1615.28] feet are feeling like they're lad you
[1612.36 - 1618.20] can't walk dizziness blurriness blurry
[1615.28 - 1620.52] eyes severe brain fog panic attacks
[1618.20 - 1624.28] every single other day I'm just naming a
[1620.52 - 1627.08] few symptoms Tremors tick spasms severe
[1624.28 - 1629.56] OCD and they just get tricked into it so
[1627.08 - 1631.68] the empires are being built sucking in
[1629.56 - 1633.64] all the chronically ill that think
[1631.68 - 1636.64] everybody's sick the same way they're
[1633.64 - 1638.64] sick it's a trick they're not remember
[1636.64 - 1641.36] intermittent fasting is all about that
[1638.64 - 1644.32] dude that was never sick decided to try
[1641.36 - 1647.64] to get looking a little better so he can
[1644.32 - 1649.24] meet his new girlfriend got into the gym
[1647.64 - 1652.08] knocked out the steak and eggs in the
[1649.24 - 1654.92] morning notice it was working and it
[1652.08 - 1656.56] took off from there so the chronic leel
[1654.92 - 1658.24] they're all buying into it though
[1656.56 - 1659.96] they're thinking this must be the way
[1658.24 - 1662.28] this must be where I'm supposed to go so
[1659.96 - 1664.40] they're buying into all the programs and
[1662.28 - 1666.12] all the different clicks meaning they're
[1664.40 - 1668.44] clicking all the websites and
[1666.12 - 1670.20] subscribing and paying subscription fees
[1668.44 - 1671.96] for websites because they're seeing all
[1670.20 - 1674.00] these people intermittent fast and their
[1671.96 - 1676.44] doctors are like have you tried
[1674.00 - 1678.48] intermittent fasting that might be
[1676.44 - 1680.96] something good for you well let's see I
[1678.48 - 1683.72] could barely take a shower my legs feel
[1680.96 - 1686.44] like lead my Skin's on fire I've been to
[1683.72 - 1688.68] 10 neurologists let me try the cint
[1686.44 - 1691.76] fasting I saw this guy out there he ran
[1688.68 - 1694.72] 10 miles and then hopped on a bicycle
[1691.76 - 1696.48] and then he looked all triming good and
[1694.72 - 1699.52] yeah his hair might be dyed and he's got
[1696.48 - 1702.08] implants and veneers in but the guy
[1699.52 - 1703.84] looks like he's he's doing great and I
[1702.08 - 1706.52] think I could try to get like that
[1703.84 - 1709.00] people don't realize it's more than this
[1706.52 - 1711.64] now I'm not denying someone doesn't get
[1709.00 - 1714.04] an improvement with intermittent fasting
[1711.64 - 1716.88] to start with if they're a person that's
[1714.04 - 1718.96] got a constitution they're strong to
[1716.88 - 1721.40] start with no real health problems at
[1718.96 - 1724.60] all and they start intermittent fasting
[1721.40 - 1726.88] they hack it they do it and they see
[1724.60 - 1729.20] some improvements I'm not denying that
[1726.88 - 1731.44] so anybody out there listening that's
[1729.20 - 1735.16] saying oh he's so wrong I know this one
[1731.44 - 1737.80] guy my coach my trainer does this my guy
[1735.16 - 1739.80] does this I'm not doubting any of that
[1737.80 - 1742.48] because when that coach trainer or
[1739.80 - 1744.56] friend or person did the hack
[1742.48 - 1747.28] intermittent fasting hack and got
[1744.56 - 1749.48] improvements it was helping them because
[1747.28 - 1752.32] For the First Time in their life they
[1749.48 - 1755.20] stopped that big old bacon egg sandwich
[1752.32 - 1756.92] in the morning they stopped all that fat
[1755.20 - 1758.68] in the morning maybe they stopped cakes
[1756.92 - 1762.00] cookies and donuts in the morning or
[1758.68 - 1763.92] Bagels in the morning maybe they didn't
[1762.00 - 1767.00] eat that in the morning ever they just
[1763.92 - 1771.36] drank coffee but their lunch was pizza
[1767.00 - 1774.20] from fried food Burgers hot dogs chicken
[1771.36 - 1777.28] sandwiches fast food maybe even
[1774.20 - 1780.20] home-cooked foods frozen foods but they
[1777.28 - 1783.08] were all drenched in fat they were fatty
[1780.20 - 1785.64] foods and maybe they stopped eating
[1783.08 - 1788.84] those lunches and so they went their
[1785.64 - 1791.60] morning they went their afternoon and
[1788.84 - 1794.20] they waited to nighttime and they got
[1791.60 - 1798.60] into some healthier options like leaner
[1794.20 - 1801.16] protein say not as much bad carb not as
[1798.60 - 1804.04] much oil on things they were just eating
[1801.16 - 1806.52] like some chicken breast they shed a few
[1804.04 - 1809.28] pounds got a little energy back started
[1806.52 - 1811.20] working out more and it worked for them
[1809.28 - 1813.36] they got by they had a constitution they
[1811.20 - 1815.44] were strong then you got the person
[1813.36 - 1817.52] who's been into health for a while they
[1815.44 - 1819.12] didn't have all greasy Foods in the
[1817.52 - 1821.40] morning that wasn't their thing they
[1819.12 - 1823.84] left the standard American diet along
[1821.40 - 1827.44] time ago they've been bouncing back from
[1823.84 - 1830.56] vegan to animal protein to veganism
[1827.44 - 1832.44] again plant-based then animal protein
[1830.56 - 1835.80] they've been doing it for years they got
[1832.44 - 1837.92] a few symptoms they're not so so sick
[1835.80 - 1840.96] yet but they've been told they've had a
[1837.92 - 1843.48] thyroid imbalance adrenal issues
[1840.96 - 1845.64] hormones are imbalanced they're not
[1843.48 - 1847.44] really really sick but they've had
[1845.64 - 1849.96] enough doctor visits throughout the
[1847.44 - 1851.56] years they got nutritionists they care
[1849.96 - 1853.64] about their health they care about their
[1851.56 - 1855.44] well-being they look at everything out
[1853.64 - 1858.00] there that's healthy they're always
[1855.44 - 1859.96] reading things they get books all of
[1858.00 - 1862.44] this but they don't have a neurological
[1859.96 - 1863.92] disease they're not suffering from
[1862.44 - 1865.76] something neurological where they're
[1863.92 - 1867.52] bedridden or a mattress Island they're
[1865.76 - 1869.48] living their life they're running around
[1867.52 - 1871.72] they're hitting juice bars they're
[1869.48 - 1874.36] hitting vegan restaurants they're eating
[1871.72 - 1876.76] some animal products once in a while
[1874.36 - 1878.44] they do back and forth they're always
[1876.76 - 1881.68] trying to look for the new trend and the
[1878.44 - 1883.72] new thing but it's still not working for
[1881.68 - 1885.92] them they have a problem they know
[1883.72 - 1888.32] they're not healing they know they're
[1885.92 - 1891.12] not improving they're saying to
[1888.32 - 1892.72] themselves is this as good as it gets
[1891.12 - 1894.36] these are the people that do peanut
[1892.72 - 1896.92] butter smoothies in the morning throw
[1894.36 - 1898.76] MCT oil in everything have coconut oil
[1896.92 - 1901.20] in everything do different types of
[1898.76 - 1904.68] smoothies with almond butter in that
[1901.20 - 1907.44] assai bowls with nut butter on them eggs
[1904.68 - 1908.96] and a stir fry eggs and an omelette with
[1907.44 - 1911.48] some spinach in it or some type of
[1908.96 - 1914.00] vegetable avocado toast they'll have
[1911.48 - 1916.68] that too beans they'll play around with
[1914.00 - 1919.00] different beans lunch should be a salad
[1916.68 - 1921.76] hardboiled eggs thrown on top maybe
[1919.00 - 1925.44] chicken in a salad or Pizza in a
[1921.76 - 1928.24] gluten-free crust or tofu maybe they'll
[1925.44 - 1930.68] have some type of soy product or another
[1928.24 - 1933.20] smoothie with protein powder in it and
[1930.68 - 1935.88] some Nut Butter they pride in eating
[1933.20 - 1937.68] healthier options they got experience in
[1935.88 - 1939.24] the health realm they've been around
[1937.68 - 1941.04] they tried a lot of different things
[1939.24 - 1943.24] some things worked in the moment some
[1941.04 - 1945.04] things didn't then they got advice from
[1943.24 - 1946.88] somebody else and tried it it almost
[1945.04 - 1949.56] worked tried something else but they're
[1946.88 - 1951.60] heal just isn't where it should be and
[1949.56 - 1955.08] then they hear about intermittent
[1951.60 - 1957.40] fasting and they're like what don't eat
[1955.08 - 1959.40] so stop my smoothies in the morning stop
[1957.40 - 1962.56] my vegetable burritos in the afternoon
[1959.40 - 1964.24] all right I'll just give it a try doing
[1962.56 - 1966.60] it doing it I'm starting to feel a
[1964.24 - 1969.20] little better my bloating is going down
[1966.60 - 1972.44] I think I have a little bit more energy
[1969.20 - 1974.00] something's working okay I think this is
[1972.44 - 1977.16] really great I think I found the Holy
[1974.00 - 1979.00] Grail this is incredible so the thing
[1977.16 - 1981.52] that these two groups of people have in
[1979.00 - 1983.60] common is they have a nervous system
[1981.52 - 1986.72] strong enough to actually handle the
[1983.60 - 1989.12] caffeine high the caffeine syndrome they
[1986.72 - 1991.56] can drink matcha tea green tea they can
[1989.12 - 1993.92] drink Kombucha Tea which is caffeine
[1991.56 - 1996.76] they can drink coffee espresso all day
[1993.92 - 1999.28] long they just don't do water all day
[1996.76 - 2001.88] long because if they were somebody that
[1999.28 - 2003.56] was sicker and couldn't handle that much
[2001.88 - 2005.60] caffeine all day long because they were
[2003.56 - 2007.60] too sick they had chronic illness
[2005.60 - 2010.32] neurological problems
[2007.60 - 2012.80] and they just did water only they would
[2010.32 - 2015.04] never survive it you wouldn't function
[2012.80 - 2017.08] from water from the time you wake up
[2015.04 - 2019.24] till the time you almost go to bed
[2017.08 - 2022.44] basically and then you eat then it
[2019.24 - 2025.76] wouldn't be enough calories enough blood
[2022.44 - 2027.80] sugar glucose to keep you going but
[2025.76 - 2029.56] these two groups of people have a strong
[2027.80 - 2032.04] enough nervous system they didn't get
[2029.56 - 2034.68] sick enough yet so they're able to
[2032.04 - 2037.52] partake in the hack thinking it's the
[2034.68 - 2040.28] Holy Grail it's moving them forward and
[2037.52 - 2041.76] then it all crashes down the road later
[2040.28 - 2043.68] now there are a bunch of people out
[2041.76 - 2045.76] there that can't go that long they can't
[2043.68 - 2048.36] go to the end of the day till almost
[2045.76 - 2050.80] night time before they go to bed they
[2048.36 - 2054.56] have to start eating at 2 they have to
[2050.80 - 2057.44] start eating at 4: or 3: or six the
[2054.56 - 2060.40] latest because they don't have a
[2057.44 - 2063.76] constitution like some other people do
[2060.40 - 2066.60] that's why the oniz fits-all gang
[2063.76 - 2068.52] doesn't realize everybody has a
[2066.60 - 2071.16] different problem a different Health
[2068.52 - 2074.96] State a different mental state no one's
[2071.16 - 2077.20] all the same but they create a trend to
[2074.96 - 2079.48] try to package it up as everybody's the
[2077.20 - 2081.92] same everybody can do this you can do
[2079.48 - 2083.92] this tomorrow but it's not really true
[2081.92 - 2086.96] or accurate there's people that have
[2083.92 - 2088.44] panic attacks by 1:00 in the afternoon 2
[2086.96 - 2090.60] o'clock in the afternoon and they have
[2088.44 - 2093.20] to back out of intermittent fasting they
[2090.60 - 2095.16] have to quit because it's cranking up
[2093.20 - 2097.60] their anxiety and their nervous system
[2095.16 - 2100.24] and their constitution isn't is the same
[2097.60 - 2103.64] as somebody else the reason why a lot of
[2100.24 - 2106.28] people say try it it works for me see if
[2103.64 - 2109.72] it works for you cuz it doesn't always
[2106.28 - 2111.68] work for you that's why it's a crapshoot
[2109.72 - 2114.72] it's a guessing game because you don't
[2111.68 - 2117.52] know what state that person really is in
[2114.72 - 2119.48] there's people they fall apart by 11:00
[2117.52 - 2122.16] in the morning if they don't get some
[2119.48 - 2123.72] type of fuel in them and then there's
[2122.16 - 2127.48] people that are under a lot of mental
[2123.72 - 2131.44] stress they're under enormous pressure
[2127.48 - 2132.84] they have needs their system needs more
[2131.44 - 2135.00] and then there's people that have like
[2132.84 - 2138.08] two or three jobs at once really
[2135.00 - 2140.52] demanding work they work really hard
[2138.08 - 2142.84] morning till night they need a lot of
[2140.52 - 2145.56] fuel for their brain they need a lot of
[2142.84 - 2148.28] blood glucose they can't just stop
[2145.56 - 2150.48] eating and only be on coffee that might
[2148.28 - 2153.20] last for a little while but after a week
[2150.48 - 2155.76] or two they'll bottom out they'll crash
[2153.20 - 2156.96] they'll hit the wall and then maybe
[2155.76 - 2158.88] there's somebody that doesn't have have
[2156.96 - 2161.60] a lot of Demands doesn't have a lot of
[2158.88 - 2163.24] work they're into self-care only because
[2161.60 - 2164.92] they have all the time in the world they
[2163.24 - 2167.00] wake up in the morning and it's all
[2164.92 - 2169.32] about their personal self-care they
[2167.00 - 2171.64] don't have to go out do a real demanding
[2169.32 - 2174.88] job maybe they have a lot of resources a
[2171.64 - 2177.24] lot of money and what tires them out is
[2174.88 - 2179.60] they take vacations all the time that
[2177.24 - 2181.92] person might be able to sit around all
[2179.60 - 2184.84] day keep themselves busy go do
[2181.92 - 2186.88] appointments but on caffeine only like
[2184.84 - 2188.72] that's all they need is caffeine at
[2186.88 - 2190.48] least till 3:00 in the afternoon 4: in
[2188.72 - 2193.92] the afternoon and then they can eat
[2190.48 - 2196.84] something their demands on their brain
[2193.92 - 2199.08] and what people are asking of them you
[2196.84 - 2200.92] know like a school teacher with all the
[2199.08 - 2203.32] students and the students needing help
[2200.92 - 2204.88] all the time and the faculty and all all
[2203.32 - 2206.80] the different things you have to do and
[2204.88 - 2209.36] the schedule you're on it eventually
[2206.80 - 2211.44] gets tiring and then that's different
[2209.36 - 2214.08] it's like you need fuel it's why School
[2211.44 - 2216.28] teachers are known to actually be like
[2214.08 - 2218.52] whoa is there donuts ready over there
[2216.28 - 2220.28] because we need one is there a bagel
[2218.52 - 2222.88] already we need it you can't just be
[2220.28 - 2225.40] empty stomach the whole entire day while
[2222.88 - 2226.76] you need to have your faculties working
[2225.40 - 2228.64] and maybe you're somebody that thinks
[2226.76 - 2230.92] I'm wrong and that you have a really
[2228.64 - 2232.40] busy schedule you know because you're
[2230.92 - 2234.48] running around you're doing a lot of
[2232.40 - 2236.56] things well often what people don't
[2234.48 - 2238.56] realize if someone's not working a
[2236.56 - 2240.12] really really demanding job but yet
[2238.56 - 2243.12] they're really busy they're driving
[2240.12 - 2245.16] around and doing appointments usually
[2243.12 - 2247.68] it's about self-care so you're being
[2245.16 - 2249.56] serviced all day long got the massages
[2247.68 - 2252.04] while someone's working on you you're
[2249.56 - 2254.16] not working on them so if you're a
[2252.04 - 2256.16] massage therapist you're going to need
[2254.16 - 2258.24] some fuel for your brain you can't just
[2256.16 - 2261.04] be working on four patients in the
[2258.24 - 2263.56] morning four clients massaging them
[2261.04 - 2265.04] really hard hearing all their questions
[2263.56 - 2266.52] giving them all these beautiful things
[2265.04 - 2269.40] you're saying and affirmations you're
[2266.52 - 2272.20] telling them giving them light and love
[2269.40 - 2274.00] working on them that's demanding you
[2272.20 - 2275.96] need fuel for the brain so if you're
[2274.00 - 2277.96] intermittent fasting as a massage
[2275.96 - 2279.76] therapist you might eventually bottom
[2277.96 - 2282.16] out and hit the wall but the person
[2279.76 - 2285.68] who's getting serviced that person
[2282.16 - 2288.04] getting self-care they're receiving all
[2285.68 - 2290.04] that they can be on caffeine all day
[2288.04 - 2292.04] many of them if they have a constitution
[2290.04 - 2293.32] and they weren't that ill they can do
[2292.04 - 2295.64] their appointments they can get their
[2293.32 - 2297.88] nails done and they could be serviced
[2295.64 - 2300.72] all day it's like your nails done your
[2297.88 - 2302.36] massages your facials then your doctor
[2300.72 - 2304.68] appointments your doctor's working for
[2302.36 - 2306.04] you they're saying hey you know this is
[2304.68 - 2308.32] what you need and you just sit there
[2306.04 - 2310.24] okay I stand and you leave or your hair
[2308.32 - 2312.52] appointments they're working on your
[2310.24 - 2315.32] hair now you're not the hair dresser
[2312.52 - 2317.80] who's standing up for 12 hours a day
[2315.32 - 2319.96] trying to work on people if they're on
[2317.80 - 2322.08] caffeine only every single day until
[2319.96 - 2324.00] 6:00 at night they're eventually going
[2322.08 - 2325.44] to burn out cuz they need glucose for
[2324.00 - 2326.96] the brain and they're going to hit the
[2325.44 - 2329.28] wall but if you're sitting there getting
[2326.96 - 2331.60] your hair done you're being serviced and
[2329.28 - 2334.36] a lot of people who have a lot of money
[2331.60 - 2336.76] and they have the resources and they can
[2334.36 - 2339.04] travel and they can do all these things
[2336.76 - 2340.96] they're constantly being serviced so
[2339.04 - 2343.44] they can just focus on their self-care
[2340.96 - 2345.92] maybe try intermittent fasting hold back
[2343.44 - 2349.12] meals because they can focus on that
[2345.92 - 2353.00] it's a big difference once again the one
[2349.12 - 2354.80] siiz fits all method fails it's failure
[2353.00 - 2357.20] failure failure the industry and the
[2354.80 - 2359.68] trends they're all one size fits-all I
[2357.20 - 2362.48] can say it it's the truth I know it
[2359.68 - 2365.64] pisses somebody off but it's the truth
[2362.48 - 2368.76] it always has been the industry is a
[2365.64 - 2371.28] onside fits all model like take a
[2368.76 - 2373.44] hairdresser get a hairdresser she's
[2371.28 - 2375.56] standing on her feet or he's standing on
[2373.44 - 2378.92] his feet for 12 straight hours
[2375.56 - 2381.92] counseling the clients therapy
[2378.92 - 2385.16] hairdressers do therapy on their clients
[2381.92 - 2388.48] it's not just cutting hair they actually
[2385.16 - 2392.28] counsel them many hairdressers should be
[2388.48 - 2395.00] paid like psychiatrist fees and think
[2392.28 - 2397.64] about all that and then it's all the
[2395.00 - 2400.32] chemicals they're under too hairdressers
[2397.64 - 2402.60] have to inhale all the chemicals and
[2400.32 - 2405.68] that gets in their bloodstream they need
[2402.60 - 2408.08] blood sugar to defend themselves not to
[2405.68 - 2409.64] mention it's a physically demanding job
[2408.08 - 2411.68] their needs are going to be different
[2409.64 - 2414.68] than someone else especially if the
[2411.68 - 2417.60] hairdresser isn't well or has already
[2414.68 - 2420.48] Health compromises the game changes
[2417.60 - 2424.32] again same thing for a school teacher
[2420.48 - 2426.84] massage therapist bus driver or a doctor
[2424.32 - 2429.64] that's actually working a doctor that
[2426.84 - 2431.96] actually has a practice a busy practice
[2429.64 - 2434.96] demanding practice they're there at the
[2431.96 - 2436.92] office they walk in they see the patient
[2434.96 - 2438.60] they walk out they walk in they see the
[2436.92 - 2440.76] next patient and the next patient
[2438.60 - 2442.96] they're working doctors why am I saying
[2440.76 - 2444.68] that because there's doctors that are
[2442.96 - 2446.88] claiming the intermittent fasting
[2444.68 - 2449.32] program worked great for them but
[2446.88 - 2451.08] they're not practicing doctors there's
[2449.32 - 2452.92] thousands of them out there now they're
[2451.08 - 2455.64] on the internet they're YouTube doctors
[2452.92 - 2457.36] they're podcast doctors they don't work
[2455.64 - 2459.88] they have a team team of people working
[2457.36 - 2462.16] for them for their social media they
[2459.88 - 2464.08] have money they're using money for ads
[2462.16 - 2467.88] and advertisements they're running an
[2464.08 - 2470.16] entire Empire they don't work on people
[2467.88 - 2472.28] they don't have to counsel people
[2470.16 - 2474.56] therapy with people they don't have to
[2472.28 - 2476.40] give people bad news about their health
[2474.56 - 2478.16] they don't have to do anything they're
[2476.40 - 2480.68] not working with people anymore the
[2478.16 - 2483.80] demand changes so the doctor who's on
[2480.68 - 2485.60] his feet all day who has a busy practice
[2483.80 - 2487.96] may not be good with the intermittent
[2485.60 - 2490.20] fasting program on caffeine the entire
[2487.96 - 2493.80] day they might have to have lunch but
[2490.20 - 2496.00] the podcast doctor or say doctor that
[2493.80 - 2497.72] wants become famous and wants to be a
[2496.00 - 2500.36] social media doctor but not work a
[2497.72 - 2502.16] practice anymore that doctor is working
[2500.36 - 2504.64] on their self-care they're doing their
[2502.16 - 2506.24] little ice baths and their cold baths
[2504.64 - 2508.36] and their cold showers and they're
[2506.24 - 2510.48] breathing and their meditation and
[2508.36 - 2512.16] they're doing their exercise program
[2510.48 - 2513.68] they're eating the way they want they're
[2512.16 - 2515.48] focused on their foods and they can do
[2513.68 - 2517.16] their intermittent fasting too because
[2515.48 - 2519.52] they're not working
[2517.16 - 2522.24] now to understand intermittent fasting
[2519.52 - 2526.04] and how it's flawed you have to start
[2522.24 - 2527.72] with the name intermittent fasting now
[2526.04 - 2530.48] if everybody is supposed to be such
[2527.72 - 2532.24] experts like you're counting on Experts
[2530.48 - 2534.64] like you are like you're thinking well
[2532.24 - 2536.80] I'm putting my health in your hands so
[2534.64 - 2540.48] you're obviously an expert intermittent
[2536.80 - 2543.72] fasting Empires so you obviously must
[2540.48 - 2546.52] know science uh many of you have degrees
[2543.72 - 2549.92] so I'm putting my health in your hand my
[2546.52 - 2551.76] life in your hand well to start with
[2549.92 - 2555.36] here's how it's flawed it says
[2551.76 - 2557.80] intermittent fasting well the body's not
[2555.36 - 2560.28] fasting just because you skip breakfast
[2557.80 - 2563.96] you're not fasting just because you skip
[2560.28 - 2567.24] lunch you're still not fasting just
[2563.96 - 2569.60] because you skip dinner it doesn't mean
[2567.24 - 2572.24] you're fasting either you're just
[2569.60 - 2575.48] intermittent eating you're not
[2572.24 - 2579.36] intermittent fasting you're intermittent
[2575.48 - 2584.32] eating the body is not fasting unless
[2579.36 - 2587.52] you've gone 24 hours without any kind of
[2584.32 - 2592.88] carbohydrate any kind of fuel source and
[2587.52 - 2596.80] even 24 hours is a little edgy 24 hours
[2592.88 - 2600.72] and 1 second is even better the 1 second
[2596.80 - 2604.52] after the 24 hours you see our body
[2600.72 - 2607.36] isn't in fast mode until the sun
[2604.52 - 2611.80] rises and then the Sun sun rises
[2607.36 - 2614.80] again the sun rises you're not eating
[2611.80 - 2618.16] you go all the way till the sun rises
[2614.80 - 2621.60] again and you haven't eaten yet that's
[2618.16 - 2626.76] when the body starts its fasting mode
[2621.60 - 2630.60] when the Sun rises our brain expects to
[2626.76 - 2633.24] receive food at some point and if you
[2630.60 - 2636.64] don't eat in the morning right when the
[2633.24 - 2640.68] Sun rises and you eat later
[2636.64 - 2644.84] our brain is still expecting to receive
[2640.68 - 2646.80] Food it's the daytime our brain is
[2644.84 - 2650.84] active we're
[2646.80 - 2654.88] alive we're not sleeping brain is in in
[2650.84 - 2655.68] shutdown mode requiring less glucose
[2654.88 - 2658.92] it's
[2655.68 - 2661.68] awake as it's waiting for food and it
[2658.92 - 2662.40] doesn't receive it it sends a message to
[2661.68 - 2665.04] your
[2662.40 - 2667.60] adrenals and your adrenals start
[2665.04 - 2669.80] releasing ad adrenaline cuz there isn't
[2667.60 - 2671.80] any glucose for your brain because
[2669.80 - 2674.88] you're not eating first thing in the
[2671.80 - 2678.12] morning you're waiting so adrenaline
[2674.88 - 2680.88] Rises it takes the place of glucose it's
[2678.12 - 2683.08] not a great thing but it's doing it
[2680.88 - 2686.08] because your brain is waiting and the
[2683.08 - 2689.04] glucose is what your brain really needs
[2686.08 - 2690.48] so the brain uses the adrenaline as a
[2689.04 - 2693.20] glucose
[2690.48 - 2695.76] substitute as the day goes on you start
[2693.20 - 2699.00] heading to noon Sun's at its highest
[2695.76 - 2702.56] point Point your brain is still not
[2699.00 - 2706.60] receiving glucose so more adrenaline's
[2702.56 - 2709.24] produced as a substitute for the glucose
[2706.60 - 2711.84] your brain is hungry though it's
[2709.24 - 2714.92] starving for glucose it's looking for
[2711.84 - 2718.36] glucose but as the day goes on there's
[2714.92 - 2722.00] no glucose yet there's no food your
[2718.36 - 2724.52] adrenaline's pumping adrenaline's Rising
[2722.00 - 2726.40] adrenaline's getting to the brain to get
[2724.52 - 2729.04] the brain by
[2726.40 - 2731.64] as night time comes the brain is
[2729.04 - 2735.28] thinking it's going to be fed again
[2731.64 - 2738.20] because the Sun is setting the brain is
[2735.28 - 2742.12] thinking surely I'm going to get my
[2738.20 - 2746.00] glucose but if you don't eat for dinner
[2742.12 - 2749.16] and you go to bed your brain shuts down
[2746.00 - 2750.36] when morning comes again and the Sun
[2749.16 - 2754.12] starts
[2750.36 - 2758.12] Rising your brain doesn't activate your
[2754.12 - 2762.84] adrenals anymore right at the 24-hour
[2758.12 - 2765.88] Mark the brain shuts down the adrenaline
[2762.84 - 2768.64] needs it stops the adrenals from running
[2765.88 - 2771.92] and shooting adrenaline out the brain
[2768.64 - 2774.36] has decided it's not going to be fed so
[2771.92 - 2777.40] it goes into almost like a sleep mode
[2774.36 - 2781.44] even though you're awake it's a fasting
[2777.40 - 2785.04] mode it's the 24-hour Mark it's from
[2781.44 - 2787.12] sunrise to Sunrise you're not running on
[2785.04 - 2789.68] straight adrenaline anymore you're in
[2787.12 - 2792.76] fasting mode that means time to lay
[2789.68 - 2795.08] around if you want to fast if the person
[2792.76 - 2798.68] is trying to fast it's time to lay
[2795.08 - 2801.52] around not work hard not drive around
[2798.68 - 2803.64] not do anything not think too hard your
[2801.52 - 2806.20] brain doesn't have the fuel it needs
[2803.64 - 2808.88] you're actually in fasting mode now
[2806.20 - 2811.44] that's why intermittent fasting is not
[2808.88 - 2813.80] intermittent fasting you never fast
[2811.44 - 2817.40] you're not fasting you're intermittent
[2813.80 - 2819.00] eating the real name is more like that
[2817.40 - 2821.64] maybe the better name would be
[2819.00 - 2824.76] recklessly eating because that's really
[2821.64 - 2826.84] what it is why is it Reckless because
[2824.76 - 2829.12] you're killing your adrenals and you're
[2826.84 - 2831.04] starving your brain at the wrong time
[2829.12 - 2834.24] see when the brain is really in fast
[2831.04 - 2837.56] mode when you've gone 24 hours on water
[2834.24 - 2840.92] only no calories of any kind not even
[2837.56 - 2844.12] lemon not even lemon or lemon water that
[2840.92 - 2846.68] would stop the body from fasting it has
[2844.12 - 2850.04] to be 24 hours
[2846.68 - 2853.08] only water for the brain to realize
[2850.04 - 2857.28] we're in fasting mode it has to be
[2853.08 - 2858.24] sunrise to Sunrise and 1 second after
[2857.28 - 2862.20] the
[2858.24 - 2865.08] sunrise this way the adrenals shut down
[2862.20 - 2867.68] and the Brain protects you this internal
[2865.08 - 2871.36] mechanism inside the body when we truly
[2867.68 - 2872.28] are fasting intermittent fasting Trend
[2871.36 - 2875.56] it's the
[2872.28 - 2878.36] opposite people who actually are experts
[2875.56 - 2880.92] in in intermittent fasting the science
[2878.36 - 2882.96] Buffs or the expert Buffs or the people
[2880.92 - 2885.76] that are out there promoting it and
[2882.96 - 2887.80] doing it and think they're actually
[2885.76 - 2890.72] doing a service for so many people out
[2887.80 - 2892.76] there don't realize this they don't know
[2890.72 - 2895.00] about this internal mechanism they don't
[2892.76 - 2897.24] know how the brain works they don't know
[2895.00 - 2900.28] what's happening to the adrenals so when
[2897.24 - 2902.84] you intermit and fast the trendy way
[2900.28 - 2905.24] you're not really fasting instead you're
[2902.84 - 2909.16] running on adrenaline you're robbing
[2905.24 - 2911.92] Peter to pay Paul over and over and over
[2909.16 - 2914.04] again until it all start to crumble how
[2911.92 - 2916.16] did say crumble well there's not going
[2914.04 - 2917.76] to be a study on how it crumbles no
[2916.16 - 2919.16] one's going to really know no one's
[2917.76 - 2921.64] going to know anything but I'll give you
[2919.16 - 2924.40] a couple little pieces of information
[2921.64 - 2926.36] say you're a woman you're young you want
[2924.40 - 2928.68] to get pregnant someday you're planning
[2926.36 - 2930.96] on having a baby when you're 30 that's
[2928.68 - 2934.12] the time frame you're kind of like
[2930.96 - 2935.36] projecting and then or manifesting maybe
[2934.12 - 2937.12] you're manifesting I'm going to have
[2935.36 - 2939.68] children children when I'm 30 that's the
[2937.12 - 2942.00] right time for me and then you're
[2939.68 - 2944.96] intermittent fasting for a few years
[2942.00 - 2947.16] before that happens and you're burning
[2944.96 - 2949.24] out your adrenals you can't quite tell
[2947.16 - 2951.76] because you're so caffeinated you're
[2949.24 - 2954.24] caffeinated continuously you got the
[2951.76 - 2955.92] stimulants going maybe you're not doing
[2954.24 - 2958.36] intermittent fasting every single day
[2955.92 - 2961.64] perfectly maybe it's a few times a week
[2958.36 - 2963.96] it still chips away what happens is the
[2961.64 - 2967.92] adrenals start to break down they start
[2963.96 - 2972.56] to lose the precious reserves they need
[2967.92 - 2976.00] and women need adrenaline to give birth
[2972.56 - 2978.92] a baby just doesn't pop out it's
[2976.00 - 2982.52] adrenaline that allows that to happen
[2978.92 - 2985.08] adrenaline saturates a mom's entire
[2982.52 - 2987.24] nervous system central nervous system
[2985.08 - 2991.40] and every single nerve in the body so
[2987.24 - 2994.80] that the baby gets projected out so the
[2991.40 - 2997.68] strength is there the core the chi if
[2994.80 - 3000.00] you want to use that word that inner
[2997.68 - 3002.56] strength it's there because of
[3000.00 - 3005.16] adrenaline and you need those strong
[3002.56 - 3007.36] adrenals what happens with a lot of moms
[3005.16 - 3008.44] their adrenals are already toasted
[3007.36 - 3010.52] sometimes they're toasted by their
[3008.44 - 3012.56] second baby or their third baby they
[3010.52 - 3016.04] have to have C-sections or they have
[3012.56 - 3018.56] really difficult births because their
[3016.04 - 3020.56] adrenals were not where they needed to
[3018.56 - 3022.72] be and then they were fatigued
[3020.56 - 3024.88] afterwards and their adrenals were
[3022.72 - 3027.12] missing hormones and then the hair fell
[3024.88 - 3029.12] out a couple years later and they had
[3027.12 - 3031.68] other problems your health starts to
[3029.12 - 3034.44] deteriorate as you go on down the road
[3031.68 - 3037.04] intermittent fasting I'm not saying
[3034.44 - 3040.44] makes all that happen but it's a big
[3037.04 - 3042.00] contributor to that adrenal weakness and
[3040.44 - 3045.16] then you got the liver problem that
[3042.00 - 3047.88] occurs the liver has to absorb and
[3045.16 - 3050.20] sponge up all that adrenaline that free
[3047.88 - 3053.32] radical adrenaline that's floating
[3050.20 - 3056.68] around the bloodstream constantly see
[3053.32 - 3059.64] adrenaline is a threat to the brain long
[3056.68 - 3061.92] term the brain is just sending a signal
[3059.64 - 3064.52] like I want to be fed there's no blood
[3061.92 - 3067.08] sugar to be found there's no glucose not
[3064.52 - 3069.76] enough glucose to be found so I have to
[3067.08 - 3072.20] send a signal to the adrenals and get
[3069.76 - 3074.56] some adrenaline out to feed me for the
[3072.20 - 3078.04] moment but it's only temporary for a
[3074.56 - 3081.00] couple of hours then I need to be fed
[3078.04 - 3082.96] but couple hours goes by and nothing's
[3081.00 - 3084.56] happening there's no glucose someone's
[3082.96 - 3086.40] not eating because they're sitting there
[3084.56 - 3088.44] with their conscious ious their
[3086.40 - 3090.56] Consciousness is being trained by the
[3088.44 - 3093.92] intermittent fasting people to withhold
[3090.56 - 3096.28] the food so that Consciousness is saying
[3093.92 - 3098.96] no hold back from food meanwhile the
[3096.28 - 3101.24] brain is like don't do that to me I need
[3098.96 - 3104.36] the food what are you doing I need that
[3101.24 - 3106.92] glucose and fuel so the brain says sends
[3104.36 - 3110.16] a signal and the adrenals are releasing
[3106.92 - 3112.20] that adrenaline but time is passing too
[3110.16 - 3114.04] much time is passing it's becoming a
[3112.20 - 3117.08] threat to the brain now because that
[3114.04 - 3119.64] adrenaline is getting getting old it's
[3117.08 - 3121.96] being released it becomes toxic after a
[3119.64 - 3124.80] while the brain is like whoo we need
[3121.96 - 3126.68] glucose fast we need fuel fast it's not
[3124.80 - 3129.64] coming and then the liver becomes a
[3126.68 - 3132.28] sponge it soaks up all that adrenaline
[3129.64 - 3134.64] from the morning from not eating all
[3132.28 - 3137.20] that adrenaline from early afternoon
[3134.64 - 3139.72] from not eating and then more adrenaline
[3137.20 - 3142.00] is released all over again it's this
[3139.72 - 3145.04] vicious cycle the brain becomes
[3142.00 - 3147.60] desperate by 2:00 in the afternoon 3:00
[3145.04 - 3150.36] in the afternoon and it's triggering the
[3147.60 - 3153.32] adrenals sending a signal to release
[3150.36 - 3155.68] more adrenaline the liver's already been
[3153.32 - 3158.40] overburdened it's already sponging and
[3155.68 - 3160.96] sucking up all that other adrenaline all
[3158.40 - 3163.64] day long now more adrenaline is being
[3160.96 - 3165.28] released and the brain is becoming more
[3163.64 - 3167.44] desperate by the minute and more
[3165.28 - 3169.84] desperate by the minute and then people
[3167.44 - 3171.72] who are intermittent fasting are
[3169.84 - 3174.04] actually prompting their adrenals more
[3171.72 - 3176.56] and more beyond all this because they're
[3174.04 - 3178.96] bringing in caffeine remember black
[3176.56 - 3181.08] coffee no calories in there you're not
[3178.96 - 3182.44] allowed to have sugar in your coffee
[3181.08 - 3184.16] when you're intermittent fasting well
[3182.44 - 3186.36] that's the rules anyway I'm sure people
[3184.16 - 3189.12] break the rules into do different things
[3186.36 - 3190.84] but the rules are you can't have a sugar
[3189.12 - 3193.40] in there you can't have cream in there
[3190.84 - 3196.48] either you have to have black coffee or
[3193.40 - 3197.60] espressos Black Coffee iced coffee but
[3196.48 - 3201.00] it's got to be something like that
[3197.60 - 3203.92] you're allowed that maybe tea matcha tea
[3201.00 - 3206.36] but no cream and sugar no calories for
[3203.92 - 3209.64] the brain on any level no glucose for
[3206.36 - 3212.24] the brain now hm you get energy from
[3209.64 - 3214.28] that caffeine from that black coffee
[3212.24 - 3216.28] how's that possible caffeine doesn't
[3214.28 - 3220.32] give us energy because it's not an
[3216.28 - 3223.64] energy source caffeine is not a glucose
[3220.32 - 3227.44] it's not a calor but yet it goes to the
[3223.64 - 3229.56] brain and doesn't give us energy even
[3227.44 - 3232.00] though it does what does that mean how
[3229.56 - 3236.16] does it work I'll tell you how it's a
[3232.00 - 3240.60] stimulant it makes the brain scream
[3236.16 - 3243.96] help me to your adrenals caffeine is a
[3240.60 - 3245.48] drug it prompts the adrenals flooding
[3243.96 - 3248.12] your body with
[3245.48 - 3251.68] adrenaline that's what it does you get
[3248.12 - 3254.56] energy from caffeine what no not from
[3251.68 - 3257.16] caffeine you get energy from what the
[3254.56 - 3261.36] caffeine's doing to your brain and
[3257.16 - 3263.24] adrenals and that energy is fake energy
[3261.36 - 3267.32] because it's coming from instead of a
[3263.24 - 3271.16] fuel or food source it's coming from the
[3267.32 - 3274.76] depths of your body and its reserves
[3271.16 - 3276.76] your body's precious energy source it's
[3274.76 - 3278.84] not energy that you should have messed
[3276.76 - 3280.92] with it's not energy that should have
[3278.84 - 3285.36] been played with it shouldn't have been
[3280.92 - 3288.08] played it's your deep deep resource it's
[3285.36 - 3290.08] what keeps us going it's the resource we
[3288.08 - 3293.12] have inside our organs in our body it
[3290.08 - 3295.24] needs to be preserved for the rainy days
[3293.12 - 3297.80] for the hardships and things that come
[3295.24 - 3299.68] away for the stress the confrontations
[3297.80 - 3302.36] it's there for other reasons for
[3299.68 - 3304.28] childbirth it's there for stressful
[3302.36 - 3305.80] situations it's there for a car accident
[3304.28 - 3307.92] it's there for a fender bender it's
[3305.80 - 3309.76] there for something that you're up
[3307.92 - 3311.48] against it's there for that relationship
[3309.76 - 3313.40] breakup it's there for when the
[3311.48 - 3314.60] boyfriend breaks up with the girlfriend
[3313.40 - 3317.16] the girlfriend breaks up with the
[3314.60 - 3319.40] boyfriend and they're just in agony it's
[3317.16 - 3321.92] there for that divorce it's there for
[3319.40 - 3323.88] that lawsuit it's there for that problem
[3321.92 - 3326.28] people are up against it's there for all
[3323.88 - 3328.56] the different things that people in this
[3326.28 - 3331.08] world struggle with it's there for when
[3328.56 - 3333.12] you're told that you're a bad person
[3331.08 - 3334.96] when you're not a bad person it's there
[3333.12 - 3337.52] for all these different upsets
[3334.96 - 3339.88] emotionally and physically that's your
[3337.52 - 3342.76] precious reserves it's there to protect
[3339.88 - 3345.44] you and guess what we're throwing it all
[3342.76 - 3347.64] away because of a bad idea now your
[3345.44 - 3350.44] adrenals produce a lot of your hormones
[3347.64 - 3352.72] reproductive hormones too women's
[3350.44 - 3354.64] reproductive hormones and in the
[3352.72 - 3356.56] Alternative Health industry it's all
[3354.64 - 3358.40] about hormones lately everybody's
[3356.56 - 3360.28] worried about their hormones everybody's
[3358.40 - 3362.64] going to their doctors they're getting
[3360.28 - 3364.64] all their hormone profiles they're
[3362.64 - 3367.04] looking into everything they're worried
[3364.64 - 3368.96] about the hormones reproductive hormones
[3367.04 - 3371.64] all kinds of hormones thyroid hormones
[3368.96 - 3375.32] everything and then we're intermittent
[3371.64 - 3377.84] fasting and we're damaging and injuring
[3375.32 - 3380.32] one of our most profound hormone
[3377.84 - 3382.84] producers which is the adrenals and then
[3380.32 - 3385.20] wait all that intermittent fasting isn't
[3382.84 - 3387.20] good for the liver it's not great
[3385.20 - 3389.52] because the liver has to absorb all that
[3387.20 - 3392.36] adrenaline all day long and that
[3389.52 - 3395.56] caffeine too and it starts to slowly
[3392.36 - 3398.44] hinder the liver the liver is a hormone
[3395.56 - 3400.40] producer as well but wait a minute I get
[3398.44 - 3404.16] it you're somebody that's like you're
[3400.40 - 3405.80] wrong totally wrong ew I know somebody
[3404.16 - 3407.64] their blood work looks better from their
[3405.80 - 3409.28] intermittent fasting they got a good
[3407.64 - 3412.52] doctor they're looking at all their
[3409.28 - 3414.20] stats and levels and I I went and did it
[3412.52 - 3415.40] too and my blood work looks a little
[3414.20 - 3417.16] better too
[3415.40 - 3418.24] I'm feeling a little better as well I
[3417.16 - 3421.04] just don't think you know what you're
[3418.24 - 3424.56] talking about but see those results are
[3421.04 - 3427.28] a snapshot in time that's what it is
[3424.56 - 3429.80] temporary results for cleaning up
[3427.28 - 3432.08] cleaning up what once was not great
[3429.80 - 3434.76] lifestyle right all the different heavy
[3432.08 - 3438.08] fatty foods in the morning or fatty
[3434.76 - 3439.92] foods at lunchtime maybe processed foods
[3438.08 - 3442.56] a lot of people they do intermittent
[3439.92 - 3445.16] fasting they come off the ride they come
[3442.56 - 3447.16] off of the fast foods they come off the
[3445.16 - 3449.56] pizzas they come off of the burgers the
[3447.16 - 3451.28] lunches people know what it's like to
[3449.56 - 3453.92] eat a pizza for lunch you know what it's
[3451.28 - 3455.84] like right remember those days remember
[3453.92 - 3457.88] have a pizza for lunch you have more
[3455.84 - 3460.24] than a few slices and now you're just
[3457.88 - 3461.92] like half asleep and maybe you eat
[3460.24 - 3464.60] better than that and it's not about
[3461.92 - 3466.68] pizzas but the reason why people get
[3464.60 - 3470.24] results with the intermittent fasting
[3466.68 - 3473.72] the real reason is because they stopped
[3470.24 - 3476.24] the fats and that's why they get results
[3473.72 - 3479.96] like blood sugar sugar gets better as
[3476.24 - 3482.56] far as the A1C pre-diabetes can start to
[3479.96 - 3485.16] calm down maybe they feel a little bit
[3482.56 - 3487.76] more energy for the moment but either
[3485.16 - 3489.68] way they're getting some results and
[3487.76 - 3492.88] they're getting results in their blood
[3489.68 - 3495.08] test because they lowered the fats but
[3492.88 - 3498.24] not just lowered the fats they stopped
[3495.08 - 3502.72] them but here's the tricky part that's
[3498.24 - 3505.24] quick results those are quick it's hack
[3502.72 - 3507.76] results we get in trouble later
[3505.24 - 3511.08] because it's not sustainable bigger
[3507.76 - 3513.48] problems happen later brain problems
[3511.08 - 3516.56] neurotransmitter chemical problems
[3513.48 - 3519.00] neuron problems gal cell problems
[3516.56 - 3522.60] adrenal problems central nervous system
[3519.00 - 3525.80] problems liver problems all these things
[3522.60 - 3528.28] develop later it's sometimes Fast 6
[3525.80 - 3530.40] months blood test looks good doctor's
[3528.28 - 3532.40] kind of happy everything's hey you're
[3530.40 - 3536.00] intermittent fasting you're doing better
[3532.40 - 3537.84] you're exercising oh wait a minute why
[3536.00 - 3540.00] are these liver enzymes up all of a
[3537.84 - 3542.08] sudden this is strange eight months
[3540.00 - 3543.72] later oh it can't be the intermittent
[3542.08 - 3547.00] fasting because it was giving you
[3543.72 - 3549.28] results see the psych out the psych out
[3547.00 - 3551.48] is you get these quick results for a lot
[3549.28 - 3555.40] of people but all these other problems
[3551.48 - 3558.44] happen later but because we got some
[3555.40 - 3562.08] results from the start it's referenced
[3558.44 - 3564.76] so the doctor has it on his sheet and he
[3562.08 - 3566.72] references it can't be the intermittent
[3564.76 - 3570.08] fasting that's making your health go
[3566.72 - 3572.96] downhill now sir or ma'am because we
[3570.08 - 3574.88] have on record that you were improving
[3572.96 - 3578.04] from the intermittent fasting from the
[3574.88 - 3582.52] start so a year later we're seeing these
[3578.04 - 3584.08] other problems happening like brain fog
[3582.52 - 3586.88] confusion
[3584.08 - 3590.60] anxiety Panic
[3586.88 - 3593.24] depression other issues too and then
[3590.60 - 3595.56] we're seeing things change but it can't
[3593.24 - 3598.72] be the intermittent fasting because it
[3595.56 - 3602.32] showed on record it was concrete there
[3598.72 - 3604.32] were benefits you actually were healing
[3602.32 - 3606.28] something was changing we were seeing
[3604.32 - 3608.72] results and that's where the psych out
[3606.28 - 3611.40] is the psych out is is you get these
[3608.72 - 3614.72] quick hack results but nobody realizes
[3611.40 - 3617.20] the consequences that happen later the
[3614.72 - 3619.16] ramifications that occur later and
[3617.20 - 3621.80] nobody knows and the later doesn't have
[3619.16 - 3624.32] to be 10 years like oh 10 years down the
[3621.80 - 3626.00] road that's when something will happen
[3624.32 - 3628.16] well I'll rather just do this for the
[3626.00 - 3630.20] next 10 years and worry about it then no
[3628.16 - 3632.60] it can happen six months two months
[3630.20 - 3635.52] later a year later three three years
[3632.60 - 3638.08] later 10 years later for sure but it
[3635.52 - 3641.28] happens I know what you're thinking
[3638.08 - 3643.60] there's real science behind this like
[3641.28 - 3646.08] there's science there's professionals
[3643.60 - 3649.40] well there's Empires built on it lots of
[3646.08 - 3651.72] professionals involved in it now and I'm
[3649.40 - 3654.16] really Off the Mark let's talk about the
[3651.72 - 3656.84] benefits now that so-called science
[3654.16 - 3659.68] stands stands by and how intermittent
[3656.84 - 3661.48] fasting is so beneficial so let's go
[3659.68 - 3663.80] through some of the claims that are out
[3661.48 - 3665.68] there like the claims that seem to be
[3663.80 - 3669.36] hardcore where they hang their hat on
[3665.68 - 3673.36] them okay here's one reduce insulin
[3669.36 - 3675.44] resistance well scratching my head here
[3673.36 - 3678.64] if you don't eat in the
[3675.44 - 3681.84] morning you're not going to have high
[3678.64 - 3685.00] insulin resistance because there was no
[3681.84 - 3688.44] food eaten in the morning so therefore
[3685.00 - 3692.68] the pancreas didn't release
[3688.44 - 3695.56] insulin therefore there wasn't insulin
[3692.68 - 3699.28] resistance and then I wonder since I've
[3695.56 - 3702.92] been talking about that for 35 years and
[3699.28 - 3705.76] published it almost 10 years ago that if
[3702.92 - 3707.56] you keep the fats out in the morning you
[3705.76 - 3710.28] don't have the insulin resistance and
[3707.56 - 3712.96] I'm wondering did they get it from there
[3710.28 - 3715.16] or if they did discover it themselves
[3712.96 - 3717.48] recently fine
[3715.16 - 3720.04] but at the same time it's not rocket
[3717.48 - 3722.44] science it's not hard to figure this one
[3720.04 - 3724.24] out if you don't eat in the morning your
[3722.44 - 3726.04] pancreas isn't going to produce all that
[3724.24 - 3728.44] insulin you're going to have lower
[3726.04 - 3731.28] insulin production less insulin
[3728.44 - 3732.72] resistance and yes they're correct
[3731.28 - 3735.72] there's going to be less insulin
[3732.72 - 3738.16] resistance so that claim is correct even
[3735.72 - 3739.68] though there's details they're missing
[3738.16 - 3741.96] and we'll explore that a little later
[3739.68 - 3745.84] let's go to the next benefit that they
[3741.96 - 3748.48] claim human growth hormone increases
[3745.84 - 3750.72] that's the claim so they say that human
[3748.48 - 3751.60] growth hormone increases and this is a
[3750.72 - 3754.24] great
[3751.60 - 3757.52] thing yes it does
[3754.24 - 3761.00] increase on the blood test but it
[3757.52 - 3763.80] doesn't increase at all so let's go into
[3761.00 - 3766.20] how and why what they don't realize is
[3763.80 - 3768.76] the same amount of human growth hormone
[3766.20 - 3771.48] is being produced but they see more of
[3768.76 - 3773.88] it in the blood test and the reason why
[3771.48 - 3776.08] they see more human growth hormone is
[3773.88 - 3778.40] because the the fats in the bloodstream
[3776.08 - 3780.92] aren't there anymore because the person
[3778.40 - 3783.40] stopped eating they're producing the
[3780.92 - 3785.68] same amount of human growth hormone as
[3783.40 - 3788.88] they always do the difference is there's
[3785.68 - 3791.56] no fat to absorb it the fats you eat in
[3788.88 - 3794.20] the morning in your breakfast enter the
[3791.56 - 3796.76] bloodstream and choke out the human
[3794.20 - 3799.84] growth hormone and they can't see as
[3796.76 - 3802.48] much of it on the blood test also the
[3799.84 - 3805.08] fat in the blood on the blood test is
[3802.48 - 3807.52] harboring it absorbs some of that growth
[3805.08 - 3809.60] hormone and they can't see it either
[3807.52 - 3812.32] through that Avenue because it's in the
[3809.60 - 3815.16] fat itself they're not testing it in a
[3812.32 - 3818.04] serum in order to determine if that fat
[3815.16 - 3819.76] actually Harbors growth hormone but yet
[3818.04 - 3822.32] the same amount of growth hormone is
[3819.76 - 3825.12] being produced every day it hasn't been
[3822.32 - 3827.32] increased it's the same amount now
[3825.12 - 3829.56] science doesn't know the fat is
[3827.32 - 3832.08] harboring growth hormone to even test
[3829.56 - 3834.44] for it in the blood because they don't
[3832.08 - 3837.08] know it's about removing fat and that's
[3834.44 - 3839.80] why people get benefits or improvements
[3837.08 - 3842.36] they think it's just removing food so
[3839.80 - 3844.08] they're not looking at the fat and they
[3842.36 - 3846.40] won't look at the fat as being the
[3844.08 - 3849.16] problem because everybody's promoting a
[3846.40 - 3851.52] high-fat diet now here's the other piece
[3849.16 - 3853.56] they're missing when you take the food
[3851.52 - 3856.32] out of the diet in the morning you
[3853.56 - 3859.48] remove the breakfast and you don't eat
[3856.32 - 3863.00] the reason why human growth hormone also
[3859.48 - 3866.24] elevates is because of a detoxification
[3863.00 - 3867.96] process happening when you remove food
[3866.24 - 3869.84] specifically the fat which they don't
[3867.96 - 3872.72] know but when you remove food in the
[3869.84 - 3876.40] morning you can cleanse that means
[3872.72 - 3878.60] you're releasing old outdated hormones
[3876.40 - 3880.40] that are deactivated they don't work
[3878.60 - 3882.60] anymore because that's what the human
[3880.40 - 3884.96] body does it takes estrogen and
[3882.60 - 3888.36] progesterone and testosterone and it
[3884.96 - 3890.36] eliminates it and same with human growth
[3888.36 - 3893.72] hormone it's
[3890.36 - 3896.44] detoxifying out of the liver out of
[3893.72 - 3898.72] organs it's hitting the bloodstream and
[3896.44 - 3901.40] you're peeing it out you're eliminating
[3898.72 - 3903.60] it out but if you take a blood test
[3901.40 - 3906.44] you'll see more of it when you're not
[3903.60 - 3908.44] eating more of it will be in the blood
[3906.44 - 3911.60] test but they don't know these
[3908.44 - 3913.32] differences they just say oh wait look
[3911.60 - 3916.24] okay write this down and then they make
[3913.32 - 3919.20] this big claim it increases your human
[3916.24 - 3921.52] growth hormone but it's so generalized
[3919.20 - 3924.64] the details aren't there it's flawed
[3921.52 - 3926.40] science once again one size fits all
[3924.64 - 3929.48] the tools they're using like in this
[3926.40 - 3932.28] case doing the blood test is still
[3929.48 - 3934.32] measuring only one aspect of it but not
[3932.28 - 3936.28] measuring all these other aspects of it
[3934.32 - 3938.96] so the tools they're using are one size
[3936.28 - 3942.44] fits-all tools so let's go to another
[3938.96 - 3944.92] intermittent fasting claim cellular
[3942.44 - 3946.72] waste removal now this is interesting
[3944.92 - 3948.76] because I'm scratching my head right now
[3946.72 - 3950.80] the intermittent fasting people the
[3948.76 - 3953.72] Empire's built don't believe in
[3950.80 - 3956.32] cleansing they say the body does it
[3953.72 - 3959.44] itself and never needs a detox or
[3956.32 - 3961.60] cleanse mm info all these years is all
[3959.44 - 3965.60] about cleansing and detoxification of
[3961.60 - 3968.56] cells and organs so we can heal and then
[3965.60 - 3969.96] presenting tools to help us do that now
[3968.56 - 3973.68] they're saying when you intermittent
[3969.96 - 3975.52] fast cellular waste removal occurs so
[3973.68 - 3977.80] I'm just scratching my head here and I'm
[3975.52 - 3982.20] trying to see what this really is and
[3977.80 - 3986.00] it's waste removal um so waste coming
[3982.20 - 3989.48] out of a cell what waste that's
[3986.00 - 3992.28] detoxification that's cleansing so what
[3989.48 - 3994.56] they're saying is your cleansing okay
[3992.28 - 3996.00] now that makes sense in a way because
[3994.56 - 3999.56] when you stop
[3996.00 - 4001.80] eating you start to cleanse now get this
[3999.56 - 4006.08] though they just think when you stop
[4001.80 - 4008.84] eating food that's not correct really
[4006.08 - 4013.24] when you stop eating fats you start to
[4008.84 - 4015.92] cleanse so you can eat fat free food or
[4013.24 - 4018.56] food with no over at fats in the morning
[4015.92 - 4020.60] and still cleanse but they don't know
[4018.56 - 4023.72] that which means you can still get
[4020.60 - 4025.52] cellular waste removal the term they use
[4023.72 - 4029.04] now because they didn't want to use the
[4025.52 - 4031.80] detox term or the cleanse term because
[4029.04 - 4034.32] hey they wanted their own term so they
[4031.80 - 4036.20] said let's do waste removal but yet the
[4034.32 - 4038.00] body doesn't need a cleanse and the body
[4036.20 - 4040.40] doesn't need a detox we'll still stand
[4038.00 - 4042.68] by that and what they don't realize it's
[4040.40 - 4046.00] removing the fat that allows for their
[4042.68 - 4049.44] claim cellular waste removal to even
[4046.00 - 4051.84] occur not removing food itself if you
[4049.44 - 4055.08] eat an orange in the morning you still
[4051.84 - 4057.12] will have cleansing power and ability
[4055.08 - 4059.72] you still will have cellular waste
[4057.12 - 4062.48] removal if you eat an avocado in the
[4059.72 - 4065.04] morning you won't get cellular waste
[4062.48 - 4067.24] removal anymore and that's how that
[4065.04 - 4070.28] works all right let's go to the next
[4067.24 - 4072.24] claim they got cell
[4070.28 - 4075.08] renewal oh
[4072.24 - 4076.64] boy all right this is interesting so
[4075.08 - 4079.80] they say sell renewal when you
[4076.64 - 4082.44] intermittent fast okay well if you're
[4079.80 - 4084.84] jacked up on caffeine all day long not
[4082.44 - 4087.72] getting any nutrients in you and then
[4084.84 - 4091.00] you top it off with a big sloppy greasy
[4087.72 - 4092.48] crappy meal at the end of the day uh I
[4091.00 - 4094.24] don't know how much sell renewal you're
[4092.48 - 4097.08] really going to have and here's the
[4094.24 - 4099.12] other thing here's the real detail
[4097.08 - 4101.40] that's important there's no way to
[4099.12 - 4103.40] determine if it's cell renewal they
[4101.40 - 4105.96] don't have the tools yet in science
[4103.40 - 4108.64] because you will never know the
[4105.96 - 4111.20] difference between how much cell die off
[4108.64 - 4113.96] you're having and how much cell renewal
[4111.20 - 4116.12] you're having it's impossible to
[4113.96 - 4118.64] determine science might be able to
[4116.12 - 4121.36] determine it 500 years from now but all
[4118.64 - 4124.44] we have is a theory right now because
[4121.36 - 4127.60] they can't measure there's no measuring
[4124.44 - 4131.48] tool in existence right now that can
[4127.60 - 4134.96] measure how many cells are renewing or
[4131.48 - 4138.56] being created versus how many cells are
[4134.96 - 4141.60] dying or weakening we don't have that
[4138.56 - 4144.12] scientific tool yet it doesn't exist so
[4141.60 - 4147.12] what they're doing is theorizing because
[4144.12 - 4150.44] it sounds exciting it's like whoa this
[4147.12 - 4152.28] creates cell renewal this is amazing and
[4150.44 - 4154.96] it's a claim they can make that gets
[4152.28 - 4157.00] everybody excited and no one's going to
[4154.96 - 4159.08] really doubt it and anybody in health is
[4157.00 - 4161.32] going to be like sell renewal that's
[4159.08 - 4164.32] awesome because it hits the whole
[4161.32 - 4165.68] anti-aging live forever Market
[4164.32 - 4168.80] can cells
[4165.68 - 4170.84] renew yeah but you need something to
[4168.80 - 4173.48] make that happen you need something more
[4170.84 - 4175.64] than caffeine all day and a sloppy meal
[4173.48 - 4178.32] at the end of the day you need
[4175.64 - 4181.88] antioxidants mineral salts trace
[4178.32 - 4185.32] minerals phyto chemical compounds
[4181.88 - 4188.16] anthocyanins glucose macrominerals you
[4185.32 - 4191.12] need all of these plus more and you need
[4188.16 - 4193.88] them entering the body more than once a
[4191.12 - 4196.60] day but most intermittent fasters are
[4193.88 - 4198.76] not into the cell renewal game they're
[4196.60 - 4200.88] in the cell destruction game they got
[4198.76 - 4203.80] the caffeine cranking all day long they
[4200.88 - 4206.60] got the adrenaline pumping all the way
[4203.80 - 4209.40] adrenaline is corrosive it's cell
[4206.60 - 4212.64] damaging that's what adrenaline does
[4209.40 - 4214.80] caffeine cell damaging and the other
[4212.64 - 4216.40] problem is they're not eating a pound of
[4214.80 - 4217.88] spinach at the end of the day and a
[4216.40 - 4219.92] whole bunch of fruit where you're
[4217.88 - 4221.96] getting those antioxidants the glucose
[4219.92 - 4223.96] and the phytochemical compounds they're
[4221.96 - 4226.16] eating a burger they're eating some
[4223.96 - 4228.56] chicken they're eating other Foods I'm
[4226.16 - 4230.24] not saying chicken's bad or Burger's bad
[4228.56 - 4232.84] or what's good or bad I'm just saying
[4230.24 - 4234.96] there's no Healing Foods there's no
[4232.84 - 4237.64] powerful tools there they're not
[4234.96 - 4239.44] drinking 32 ounces of celery juice at
[4237.64 - 4241.40] the end of the day a pound of spinach
[4239.44 - 4243.28] and a whole bunch of asparagus that's
[4241.40 - 4245.88] the last thing they're eating now let's
[4243.28 - 4250.04] head to their next hypothesis their next
[4245.88 - 4253.72] claim beneficial gene expression so gene
[4250.04 - 4254.48] expression gets better okay so you get
[4253.72 - 4256.96] better
[4254.48 - 4258.64] genes um so what they're saying the
[4256.96 - 4263.04] hypothesis is because they haven't seen
[4258.64 - 4266.12] it but they think changes to molecules
[4263.04 - 4268.72] involved with genes could help with
[4266.12 - 4271.60] longevity so it could be related to
[4268.72 - 4273.80] longevity that's the hypothesis now when
[4271.60 - 4275.56] you really break it down there's nothing
[4273.80 - 4277.92] there at all they don't see anything
[4275.56 - 4279.60] they have no scientific proof nothing's
[4277.92 - 4282.68] there but it's a great one to kind of
[4279.60 - 4285.00] throw into the mix gets people excited
[4282.68 - 4287.40] really nothing to say about it because
[4285.00 - 4290.76] it doesn't really exist so there is
[4287.40 - 4292.24] nothing to say about it sure if you're
[4290.76 - 4294.20] doing something better for your health
[4292.24 - 4296.56] you hope your genes are getting better
[4294.20 - 4298.36] in this case they haven't seen it they
[4296.56 - 4301.36] don't know but they're just going to
[4298.36 - 4305.04] assume it's even possible okay so here's
[4301.36 - 4309.60] our next claim weight loss well all
[4305.04 - 4312.36] right um You Take Away food for as many
[4309.60 - 4315.00] hours as you can for as much of the day
[4312.36 - 4317.72] as you can you eat
[4315.00 - 4318.88] less uh yeah there's going to be a bunch
[4317.72 - 4321.16] of dudes out there that are going to
[4318.88 - 4323.20] lose weight and you'll notice out there
[4321.16 - 4325.44] if you talk to enough people they start
[4323.20 - 4329.20] their intermittent fasting program at
[4325.44 - 4332.48] the very same moment in time they start
[4329.20 - 4334.60] exercising or cranking up their exercise
[4332.48 - 4336.72] they're not eating and they're like
[4334.60 - 4339.20] starving so then they're like I better
[4336.72 - 4341.04] start exercising keep my anxiety down or
[4339.20 - 4342.88] whatever but either way there's
[4341.04 - 4345.08] different people doing different things
[4342.88 - 4347.04] but most of the time they start both at
[4345.08 - 4349.80] the same time of course if you're not
[4347.04 - 4351.48] eating anymore and you're exercising
[4349.80 - 4353.44] more you're going to start losing some
[4351.48 - 4355.68] weight I know there's people who've
[4353.44 - 4357.68] already been exercising and they're just
[4355.68 - 4359.92] eating whatever their high fat meals and
[4357.68 - 4362.12] their normal programs whatever and then
[4359.92 - 4363.80] they start to intermittent fast while
[4362.12 - 4365.20] they're exercising the same way and
[4363.80 - 4367.16] they're losing weight too cuz they
[4365.20 - 4369.16] stopped eating I know there's some
[4367.16 - 4371.52] people out there that are going to say
[4369.16 - 4373.20] no I eat the same amount of calories as
[4371.52 - 4376.36] I always have I just eat it at the end
[4373.20 - 4377.96] of the the day and not really cuz you
[4376.36 - 4379.72] don't really remember what you used to
[4377.96 - 4381.64] do the binges and the different times
[4379.72 - 4383.40] you used to eat and the different foods
[4381.64 - 4386.00] you didn't have it all down you weren't
[4383.40 - 4388.24] measuring every calorie ever now you're
[4386.00 - 4391.00] kind of more mindful but no you're
[4388.24 - 4393.08] eating less calories and so many are
[4391.00 - 4395.08] trying to control their Cravings so they
[4393.08 - 4396.40] like their intermittent fasting program
[4395.08 - 4399.12] because they're controlling their
[4396.40 - 4400.92] Cravings they're like craving all day
[4399.12 - 4402.72] but they're trying to say oh no wait I'm
[4400.92 - 4404.72] just going to keep the coffee going in
[4402.72 - 4407.40] and I'm going to just keep that under
[4404.72 - 4409.04] control and I'm going to reward myself
[4407.40 - 4410.60] at the end of the day and I'll eat
[4409.04 - 4412.52] whatever I want at the end of the day
[4410.60 - 4414.36] but I'll hold back all my Cravings all
[4412.52 - 4416.04] day long but here's the other thing
[4414.36 - 4420.00] people don't realize their stomach
[4416.04 - 4422.28] starts to shrink starts to get smaller
[4420.00 - 4423.40] because they're not eating all day and
[4422.28 - 4426.40] they're just doing some different
[4423.40 - 4428.20] liquids like say coffee for one right so
[4426.40 - 4431.16] by the time of the night time comes or
[4428.20 - 4434.68] the end of the day their big meal isn't
[4431.16 - 4437.36] as big as their meals used to be because
[4434.68 - 4439.48] their stomach is not stretched as much
[4437.36 - 4442.00] so their stomach is shrinking so the
[4439.48 - 4443.44] meals aren't as big at the end of the
[4442.00 - 4446.68] day it's another reason why they're
[4443.44 - 4449.60] losing weight so yes the claim of losing
[4446.68 - 4452.68] weight is actually real but here's how
[4449.60 - 4456.56] it works it's real because you stopped
[4452.68 - 4460.04] eating fat because eating fat makes you
[4456.56 - 4463.40] fat fat makes you fat that's how it
[4460.04 - 4465.88] works this is why people who do high fat
[4463.40 - 4468.92] diets and work out and lost some weight
[4465.88 - 4471.32] years ago end up having to go and do
[4468.92 - 4472.92] intermittent fasting years later because
[4471.32 - 4475.36] they can't keep their weight under
[4472.92 - 4477.28] control anymore they're working out they
[4475.36 - 4480.08] seem to be doing all the right things
[4477.28 - 4482.08] they're eating healthy meals but they're
[4480.08 - 4485.04] keeping the fats in they're doing the
[4482.08 - 4486.52] nut Butters the lean proteins and
[4485.04 - 4487.92] they're having their MCT oil and
[4486.52 - 4490.48] everything else but they don't realize
[4487.92 - 4492.20] it it's all fat and then they need some
[4490.48 - 4494.48] carbs once in a while so they throw
[4492.20 - 4497.36] those in too but they're trying to do it
[4494.48 - 4499.32] in a balanced way and it worked for them
[4497.36 - 4501.24] for a while because it got them off the
[4499.32 - 4503.52] standard American diet many years ago
[4501.24 - 4505.96] and they became Health experts in a way
[4503.52 - 4508.16] they started training they started
[4505.96 - 4511.12] exercising and they started doing all
[4508.16 - 4513.28] that and then the weight wasn't
[4511.12 - 4514.96] controllable anymore and they're like
[4513.28 - 4517.24] What's the next phase and they hear
[4514.96 - 4519.64] about intermittent fasting so then they
[4517.24 - 4523.44] stop eating all together for most of the
[4519.64 - 4526.60] day because really reality the constant
[4523.44 - 4528.76] high fat diet is not sustainable the
[4526.60 - 4531.76] constant healthy high fat diet that
[4528.76 - 4534.96] everybody's on that gravitates to after
[4531.76 - 4537.64] you've been on standard American is not
[4534.96 - 4539.60] sustainable so when you grow up you go
[4537.64 - 4541.28] to college or you grow up and you do
[4539.60 - 4542.92] whatever and you're getting older and
[4541.28 - 4544.48] you're eating standard American you eat
[4542.92 - 4546.64] what you want you have your pizza here
[4544.48 - 4548.68] you do what you want here and the weight
[4546.64 - 4551.68] is gaining you want to exercise and get
[4548.68 - 4555.00] the weight off and then you go high fat
[4551.68 - 4557.32] keto or high fat whatever or some type
[4555.00 - 4559.56] of other healthy high-fat diet and you
[4557.32 - 4562.36] say whoa found the Holy Grail I know my
[4559.56 - 4565.76] deal I count my macros I'm eating my
[4562.36 - 4568.32] proteins I'm eating my fats and then you
[4565.76 - 4570.68] start getting sicker or something goes
[4568.32 - 4573.00] wrong or weight starts gaining and
[4570.68 - 4575.24] you're like what is going on and you run
[4573.00 - 4576.76] into some trainer or some guy at the gym
[4575.24 - 4579.32] who's like you should intermittent fast
[4576.76 - 4581.68] man everybody's doing this so now you
[4579.32 - 4583.88] leave your high-fat diet which was not
[4581.68 - 4586.08] sustainable and now you head to not
[4583.88 - 4587.96] eating at all until the end of the day
[4586.08 - 4590.88] and you think you found the Holy Grail
[4587.96 - 4593.20] again but you didn't because you hit the
[4590.88 - 4595.20] wall when you intermittent fast as well
[4593.20 - 4597.28] it takes time happens at a different
[4595.20 - 4599.00] moment for everybody but you end up
[4597.28 - 4601.48] hitting the wall you're back to square
[4599.00 - 4602.96] one you're eating fats all over again
[4601.48 - 4604.48] it's not sustainable then you're
[4602.96 - 4606.72] intermittent fasting then you're
[4604.48 - 4609.00] vacillating back and forth constantly
[4606.72 - 4610.84] intermittent fasting for some weeks then
[4609.00 - 4612.68] going back to eating high fat diet
[4610.84 - 4614.40] healthy high fat diet for some weeks
[4612.68 - 4616.48] then intermittent fasting and then
[4614.40 - 4619.00] you're just rebounding you're going back
[4616.48 - 4621.20] and forth back and forth cravings and
[4619.00 - 4623.16] all not getting the things you need and
[4621.20 - 4625.28] you're just running around in circles
[4623.16 - 4627.72] and you're chasing your tail because
[4625.28 - 4630.44] both intermittent fasting and a healthy
[4627.72 - 4633.44] high-fat diet are not sustainable long
[4630.44 - 4637.32] term so let's cover a couple more claims
[4633.44 - 4641.72] this is fun heart health improves heart
[4637.32 - 4645.36] health okay well if you stop pancakes
[4641.72 - 4649.24] with butter all over it sausage bacon
[4645.36 - 4651.24] eggs ham cheese cream in the morning and
[4649.24 - 4655.56] you don't do that anymore and you don't
[4651.24 - 4657.56] do it for lunch either hm I think you
[4655.56 - 4659.96] might be getting better heart results
[4657.56 - 4662.28] somewhere along the way for sure
[4659.96 - 4664.36] cardiovascular you're not butter heart
[4662.28 - 4666.56] attacking yourself to death you're not
[4664.36 - 4668.84] tanking the butter and hopefully no
[4666.56 - 4671.72] one's putting butter in their coffee cuz
[4668.84 - 4673.16] that's a heart attack in a cup but and
[4671.72 - 4675.52] that's also intermittent fasting has
[4673.16 - 4677.88] gone wrong if someone is doing that and
[4675.52 - 4679.44] the funny thing is yeah there's a lot of
[4677.88 - 4681.28] intermittent fers that are doing all
[4679.44 - 4683.32] kinds of weird things and that's one of
[4681.28 - 4685.60] them so yeah of course heart health
[4683.32 - 4687.40] improves you're not killing yourself
[4685.60 - 4690.12] eating all those high fatty foods for
[4687.40 - 4692.40] most of the day it gives you a chance
[4690.12 - 4694.12] gives the heart a chance like is it
[4692.40 - 4695.48] really rocket science I mean they didn't
[4694.12 - 4698.40] know that but they have to figure that
[4695.48 - 4700.24] out now like you don't need a couple
[4698.40 - 4703.00] hundred million dollars in a study to
[4700.24 - 4705.44] try to figure that one out but wait I'm
[4703.00 - 4707.08] M Aken they didn't figure it out now
[4705.44 - 4708.76] because they didn't know it's removing
[4707.08 - 4710.96] the fats that are giving them heart
[4708.76 - 4713.56] relief they just think it's removing the
[4710.96 - 4717.12] food so I guess they need another 20
[4713.56 - 4720.00] years or 50 years and $500 million to
[4717.12 - 4723.04] someday realize it was the fat that was
[4720.00 - 4725.60] causing the problem not the food it's
[4723.04 - 4731.28] like you go to the scientist and say are
[4725.60 - 4734.36] you guys uh food uh or fat you get you
[4731.28 - 4739.44] get the correlation so the next claim is
[4734.36 - 4740.60] May prevent Alzheimer's okay uh May
[4739.44 - 4742.84] prevent
[4740.60 - 4746.76] Alzheimer's I don't know where they got
[4742.84 - 4750.04] that from there is not one single case
[4746.76 - 4753.84] in the world of someone who was dying of
[4750.04 - 4757.56] Alzheimer's intermittent fast and then
[4753.84 - 4760.92] recovered it doesn't exist but they're
[4757.56 - 4763.88] claiming May prevent Alzheimer's they
[4760.92 - 4767.24] got no proof it never happened happened
[4763.88 - 4770.04] they don't even have one healing story
[4767.24 - 4773.36] of a grandma that doesn't know where she
[4770.04 - 4775.80] is doesn't know what street she lives on
[4773.36 - 4777.56] she has Alzheimer's it's really bad the
[4775.80 - 4780.20] whole family's worried they're losing
[4777.56 - 4784.00] her they don't have one healing story
[4780.20 - 4786.60] like oh my God my grandma she was losing
[4784.00 - 4788.48] it she was dying from Alzheimer's in
[4786.60 - 4790.96] fact they were like well she only has
[4788.48 - 4793.32] like a year left and she did
[4790.96 - 4795.48] intermittent fasting you guys she
[4793.32 - 4798.04] withheld from food all day long we had
[4795.48 - 4800.12] her jacked up on coffee she ate a big
[4798.04 - 4803.56] old sloppy meal at the end of the day
[4800.12 - 4806.28] and she healed we don't have one healing
[4803.56 - 4808.52] story so I love when they say may
[4806.28 - 4811.52] prevent Alzheimer's and then we're
[4808.52 - 4815.24] supposed to chomp at the bit
[4811.52 - 4817.88] like oh my God like that's incredible I
[4815.24 - 4819.92] better start now the other thing is how
[4817.88 - 4822.60] many grandmas can starve themselves the
[4819.92 - 4825.28] entire day like 16 hours without food
[4822.60 - 4827.36] like does your grandma do that how many
[4825.28 - 4829.96] grandpas can do that does your grandpa
[4827.36 - 4832.20] do that or is he in the cookie jar or is
[4829.96 - 4834.16] he in the cakes and goodie jar or the
[4832.20 - 4836.56] cupboard getting a snack out like are
[4834.16 - 4839.28] you kidding like how many Alzheimer's
[4836.56 - 4841.76] patients that are Grandpa or Grandma
[4839.28 - 4844.56] that you know can sit there and not eat
[4841.76 - 4847.12] all the way until 8:00 at night or 6:00
[4844.56 - 4849.16] at night huh they usually eat chocolate
[4847.12 - 4850.92] cake and everything else Under the Sun
[4849.16 - 4853.08] and on top of that if they have
[4850.92 - 4855.08] Alzheimer's you got to be the one to
[4853.08 - 4857.00] feed them right if they're really bad
[4855.08 - 4859.36] off you got to be the one to get them
[4857.00 - 4861.48] the meals so are you going to be like
[4859.36 - 4864.84] well I'm doing experiment on my grandpa
[4861.48 - 4867.40] right now we haven't fed him yet he's uh
[4864.84 - 4869.64] he's might be hungry uh his blood sugar
[4867.40 - 4871.84] might be really low doesn't have any
[4869.64 - 4875.00] energy he doesn't seem he wants to go
[4871.84 - 4876.96] outside and do anything so we're holding
[4875.00 - 4879.60] food from him let's see it's 2 o' I'm
[4876.96 - 4881.64] looking at my clock now no grandpa not
[4879.60 - 4883.76] going to feed you I know you you got
[4881.64 - 4886.80] Alzheimer's but no we're not going to
[4883.76 - 4889.08] feed you uh four o'clock Grandpa We're
[4886.80 - 4890.56] Not Gonna feed you yet 7 o'clock at
[4889.08 - 4892.48] night no grandpa we're going to try to
[4890.56 - 4895.00] do the intermittent fasting program that
[4892.48 - 4896.96] this Guru does you know this Guru
[4895.00 - 4899.76] trainer guy or whoever we're going to
[4896.96 - 4902.68] feed you at 9:00 tonight and then you
[4899.76 - 4904.24] can eat okay I'm GL grandpa I know you
[4902.68 - 4906.32] waited the whole day but we're going to
[4904.24 - 4908.60] do this every single day to determine if
[4906.32 - 4910.08] it helps prevent Alzheimer's you know
[4908.60 - 4912.36] when you really think about intermittent
[4910.08 - 4914.36] fasting and you really break it down
[4912.36 - 4916.96] like starve your kids starve your
[4914.36 - 4918.08] teenagers starve your young adults
[4916.96 - 4920.92] starve your
[4918.08 - 4923.32] grandparents to try to get a result
[4920.92 - 4926.00] because you don't know what else to do
[4923.32 - 4927.00] it's insane all right so let's do one of
[4926.00 - 4930.04] our last
[4927.00 - 4933.20] claims uh reduce
[4930.04 - 4935.20] inflammation okay reduce inflammation in
[4933.20 - 4938.08] the body so if you're intermittent
[4935.20 - 4942.20] fasting the claim is you can reduce
[4938.08 - 4944.80] inflammation in the body well yeah you
[4942.20 - 4947.36] kind of can there's a good chance you
[4944.80 - 4949.20] will the reason why is because you're
[4947.36 - 4951.24] not having gluten in the morning they
[4949.20 - 4953.64] don't know that but you're not having
[4951.24 - 4955.76] gluten in the morning you're not having
[4953.64 - 4958.84] dairy in the morning they don't know
[4955.76 - 4960.88] that either and then you're not having
[4958.84 - 4963.04] eggs in the morning they don't know that
[4960.88 - 4966.52] because they believe eggs is a great
[4963.04 - 4969.08] protein and you're not eating corn in
[4966.52 - 4971.48] the morning you're not doing soy in the
[4969.08 - 4973.48] morning but they don't know that see
[4971.48 - 4975.56] they just think food in general you're
[4973.48 - 4977.44] not eating food and because you're not
[4975.56 - 4979.44] eating food you're reducing your
[4977.44 - 4981.80] inflammation but they don't know what
[4979.44 - 4984.60] causes inflammation unless they know the
[4981.80 - 4987.28] mm info all these years which is
[4984.60 - 4989.36] pathogens cause inflammation but they
[4987.28 - 4992.40] don't know that they don't know that
[4989.36 - 4995.56] Epstein bar or shingles or set a
[4992.40 - 4999.12] megavirus or or Herby simplex one or
[4995.56 - 5001.88] hhv6 causes inflammation in the body
[4999.12 - 5003.80] they never knew that that's original
[5001.88 - 5006.40] Medical meeme information all these
[5003.80 - 5008.56] years published information that science
[5006.40 - 5011.52] actually uses and takes medical meum
[5008.56 - 5013.84] information for themselves IL legally
[5011.52 - 5017.20] and so but they don't know this they
[5013.84 - 5019.12] just think food food stops you don't eat
[5017.20 - 5022.24] food anymore in the morning so
[5019.12 - 5024.40] inflammation goes down they're like yay
[5022.24 - 5027.72] we found something but they don't know
[5024.40 - 5029.68] why because you're taking away specific
[5027.72 - 5033.56] things that could be in the mix of that
[5029.68 - 5039.56] food like gluten which feeds virus uses
[5033.56 - 5042.84] eggs which feeds viruses corn soy Dairy
[5039.56 - 5045.56] which feeds viruses pathogens and
[5042.84 - 5049.36] bacteria those things eat those very
[5045.56 - 5051.64] specific things and then those pathogens
[5049.36 - 5054.60] create the inflammation but they're not
[5051.64 - 5056.12] there yet they're not that far advanced
[5054.60 - 5058.16] yet they're just at the point where
[5056.12 - 5060.80] they're scratching their head going okay
[5058.16 - 5063.80] food's removed that person's aches and
[5060.80 - 5066.76] pains are less oh here's a great claim
[5063.80 - 5068.64] May reduce inflammation so let's talk
[5066.76 - 5072.28] about a little bit of a different topic
[5068.64 - 5075.40] here swelling edema a lot of people are
[5072.28 - 5078.48] swelling they feel swollen and when they
[5075.40 - 5081.96] intermittent fast the swelling goes down
[5078.48 - 5084.12] but like I said remember this it's not
[5081.96 - 5087.12] sustainable because people who are
[5084.12 - 5089.60] swelling wafer back and forth they
[5087.12 - 5092.84] vacillate back and forth they stop
[5089.60 - 5095.64] eating their swelling goes down and then
[5092.84 - 5098.68] they got to eat again and they're eating
[5095.64 - 5101.64] eating and then they get swollen again
[5098.68 - 5104.48] and now they have to stop eating again
[5101.64 - 5106.96] and then they desell they desell they
[5104.48 - 5109.04] swell they Dell they swell swell more
[5106.96 - 5110.64] swell more and then boom have to go all
[5109.04 - 5112.76] the way back intermittent fast
[5110.64 - 5115.80] intermittent fast so they're fasc
[5112.76 - 5119.00] relating back and forth swelling
[5115.80 - 5121.52] dwelling now how do they dwell from
[5119.00 - 5124.88] intermittent fasting they're stopping
[5121.52 - 5128.16] the food that are contributing to their
[5124.88 - 5131.20] swelling because inside the food is the
[5128.16 - 5134.00] problem what food what is it is it
[5131.20 - 5136.32] gluten is it dairy products is it eggs
[5134.00 - 5139.44] you might be like I don't do gluten but
[5136.32 - 5142.84] you do eggs I don't do eggs but you do
[5139.44 - 5145.32] cheese what is it and so these different
[5142.84 - 5147.16] foods feed pathogens but that's just one
[5145.32 - 5148.84] Avenue right there I'll give you another
[5147.16 - 5150.88] option what if you're somebody that's
[5148.84 - 5153.96] like I don't do dairy I'm vegan I'm
[5150.88 - 5157.60] plant-based I still swell I eat very
[5153.96 - 5159.76] healthy aw I have oatmeal I put peanut
[5157.60 - 5161.64] butter in my oatmeal I have avocado
[5159.76 - 5163.20] toast I do different things I have
[5161.64 - 5166.16] smoothies with protein powders
[5163.20 - 5169.56] plant-based protein powders and I find
[5166.16 - 5172.48] aw that if I stop eating alog together
[5169.56 - 5175.68] my swelling goes down yeah well in your
[5172.48 - 5178.52] situation it's liver it's an inflamed
[5175.68 - 5181.52] liver pathogens inside the liver itself
[5178.52 - 5183.44] a liver that's overburdened stagnant and
[5181.52 - 5185.88] sluggish maybe you got too many heavy
[5183.44 - 5189.24] metals combined with it all but your
[5185.88 - 5191.84] liver is struggling so you have to stop
[5189.24 - 5194.04] your plant-based Foods in the morning
[5191.84 - 5196.56] even if those plant-based Foods AR
[5194.04 - 5198.92] necessarily feeding pathogens that you
[5196.56 - 5201.08] have it's still burdening the liver
[5198.92 - 5202.80] you're at the point in your life in your
[5201.08 - 5204.76] health where you actually have to
[5202.80 - 5207.60] withhold from food to get a result to
[5204.76 - 5210.24] get the swelling down because the fat in
[5207.60 - 5213.00] your Foods the peanut butter the almond
[5210.24 - 5215.52] butter the coconut oil the avocado
[5213.00 - 5217.72] whatever it is those fats are burdening
[5215.52 - 5219.36] the liver so much that you're in a
[5217.72 - 5221.28] different position in your life you have
[5219.36 - 5223.72] to stop those fats even if you're
[5221.28 - 5226.36] plant-based in the morning or you have
[5223.72 - 5229.28] to stop your plant-based fats during the
[5226.36 - 5231.52] day the daytime as well so you're that
[5229.28 - 5235.16] person that's like well okay in the
[5231.52 - 5236.80] morning I'm not eating those anyway and
[5235.16 - 5238.88] well if you're eating them during the
[5236.80 - 5240.24] day it gets in the way as well and then
[5238.88 - 5241.92] you might be that plant-based person
[5240.24 - 5244.84] that's like well I intermittent fast and
[5241.92 - 5247.68] I found being a vegan I don't eat
[5244.84 - 5250.36] breakfast I don't eat lunch yes I drink
[5247.68 - 5254.20] coffee yes I have caffeine I try to push
[5250.36 - 5256.48] all the way to 4 5:00 6:00 before I eat
[5254.20 - 5259.84] yeah you're withholding all those fats
[5256.48 - 5262.24] again and then your swelling goes down
[5259.84 - 5265.36] the fats are contributing to the
[5262.24 - 5268.76] swelling and fats also stop the body
[5265.36 - 5270.76] from cleansing or healing so that you
[5268.76 - 5273.68] can't get rid of pathogens if you're
[5270.76 - 5276.32] always cranking the fats in the diet and
[5273.68 - 5278.92] the Bummer is it's so sad because Health
[5276.32 - 5281.08] influencers have no idea why anyone is
[5278.92 - 5283.48] really sick to begin with but they're
[5281.08 - 5287.64] pushing everybody into intermittent
[5283.48 - 5290.72] fasting as if it's a cure then when they
[5287.64 - 5292.64] do eat they eat the wrong Foods so
[5290.72 - 5295.52] people aren't being taught to go the
[5292.64 - 5297.20] right direction to heal or what to eat
[5295.52 - 5299.16] they're not eating healing foods for
[5297.20 - 5302.36] their actual symptoms and conditions the
[5299.16 - 5304.72] very reason why they're getting sick now
[5302.36 - 5306.72] a lot of people are intermittent fasting
[5304.72 - 5309.40] because of swelling because they're
[5306.72 - 5312.00] getting so inflamed and swollen and
[5309.40 - 5316.28] their body doesn't feel good it's not
[5312.00 - 5318.44] just fat or weight of fat it's water
[5316.28 - 5321.28] retension and for years I've talked
[5318.44 - 5324.80] about this where if someone's overweight
[5321.28 - 5328.76] they may only be 10 lb overweight with
[5324.80 - 5332.32] 10 lbs of water retention and edema they
[5328.76 - 5335.64] may not be 20 lbs of fat on their body
[5332.32 - 5340.08] they may have 10 lb of fat or 15 lbs of
[5335.64 - 5342.20] fat and 10 lb of water swelling fluid
[5340.08 - 5344.48] they're retaining fluid and I've talked
[5342.20 - 5348.20] about this for over 35 years when
[5344.48 - 5351.44] someone says well that person's 250 lbs
[5348.20 - 5354.20] when they're supposed to be only 180 lbs
[5351.44 - 5356.16] they got you know that much more fat on
[5354.20 - 5360.76] them it's like well wait a minute there
[5356.16 - 5364.24] could be 30 lbs of retaining fluid edema
[5360.76 - 5366.84] happening and then the rest is fat so
[5364.24 - 5369.48] when that swelling goes down in a day
[5366.84 - 5373.24] they look like they lost 10 pounds like
[5369.48 - 5375.20] 10 pounds fast 10 pounds a week
[5373.24 - 5377.48] especially if they just stop eating all
[5375.20 - 5380.60] of a sudden they lose this initial
[5377.48 - 5383.72] swelling they don't lose fat they just
[5380.60 - 5385.52] lose all this water retention the fluid
[5383.72 - 5388.20] the swelling of the
[5385.52 - 5390.88] fluid but different people swell for
[5388.20 - 5392.28] different reasons cuz I know the
[5390.88 - 5393.80] alternative movement want once again's
[5392.28 - 5395.60] one size fits-all they just think
[5393.80 - 5398.32] everybody's got the same swelling
[5395.60 - 5401.80] problem but they don't some people are
[5398.32 - 5404.16] really viral low grade viral infections
[5401.80 - 5407.64] and these viral infections inhabit their
[5404.16 - 5410.80] liver making their liver so sluggish and
[5407.64 - 5413.88] toxic that their lymphatic system starts
[5410.80 - 5416.24] to gain fluid because their liver is so
[5413.88 - 5418.56] clogged up and then you might have
[5416.24 - 5420.12] somebody else it's a little different
[5418.56 - 5422.76] it's not just a low grade viral
[5420.12 - 5425.36] infection and somebody else might have a
[5422.76 - 5428.04] stagnant sluggish liver without the
[5425.36 - 5431.24] pathogen problem the low-grade viral
[5428.04 - 5433.36] infection instead a really fatty liver
[5431.24 - 5434.80] with lots of different toxins in them
[5433.36 - 5437.28] and then you got people with salt
[5434.80 - 5439.64] addictions they're salted out they got
[5437.28 - 5441.88] salt deposits inside of them everywhere
[5439.64 - 5444.84] their liver has salt deposits in it
[5441.88 - 5446.88] their bloodstream is high in sodium they
[5444.84 - 5449.56] got salt everywhere and then they're
[5446.88 - 5453.08] addicted to the flavor they need that
[5449.56 - 5455.64] salt flavor and there's people that say
[5453.08 - 5458.56] Hey I I don't add salt I never add salt
[5455.64 - 5460.32] to anything no way I'm not really big on
[5458.56 - 5462.00] salt meanwhile they're eating so much
[5460.32 - 5463.68] salt they don't even realize that they
[5462.00 - 5466.48] go buy a sandwich somewhere and the
[5463.68 - 5469.04] thing is salted out 10 Ways to Sunday
[5466.48 - 5471.24] because they don't know and then they go
[5469.04 - 5474.48] eat over somebody's house or family
[5471.24 - 5476.36] makes them something to eat or salt and
[5474.48 - 5478.44] coffee that's another thing people don't
[5476.36 - 5481.12] realize it they make coffee more
[5478.44 - 5484.12] addictive because the coffee shops put
[5481.12 - 5487.88] salt in the water sodium is in the water
[5484.12 - 5489.96] at the coffee shops it's salty coffee
[5487.88 - 5492.44] and everybody's drinking it down and
[5489.96 - 5494.80] they don't realize it and then sauce is
[5492.44 - 5497.52] everywhere different condiments and
[5494.80 - 5501.16] sauces tomato sauce salts everywhere and
[5497.52 - 5504.28] then restaurants eating out takeout food
[5501.16 - 5507.20] even if it's healthy vegan takeout food
[5504.28 - 5510.60] or vegetarian takeout food it's extra
[5507.20 - 5512.84] salty everybody salt it out and then
[5510.60 - 5515.56] they'll have some chips healthy chips
[5512.84 - 5517.56] they're salty too salt gets so out of
[5515.56 - 5520.08] control they're swelling they're
[5517.56 - 5522.04] swelling everywhere they stop eating
[5520.08 - 5524.92] they intermittent fast they don't
[5522.04 - 5527.32] realize it but they just back down the
[5524.92 - 5529.80] salt that brings down the swelling that
[5527.32 - 5531.72] alone now you'll often hear from people
[5529.80 - 5535.28] who intermittent fast that they can
[5531.72 - 5537.60] think more clear they got Clarity like
[5535.28 - 5539.64] they're not as fogged and one of the
[5537.60 - 5541.88] reasons is they're avoiding a lot of
[5539.64 - 5544.40] foods in the morning or during the day
[5541.88 - 5547.28] that would bog them down slow them down
[5544.40 - 5549.80] and starve their brain of glucose for
[5547.28 - 5551.72] example they're eating high fatty foods
[5549.80 - 5554.72] during the morning or during the
[5551.72 - 5557.44] afternoon you get high blood fat high
[5554.72 - 5560.04] blood fat creates insulin resistance it
[5557.44 - 5562.60] stops critically needed glucose and
[5560.04 - 5564.68] sugar from getting to your brain and
[5562.60 - 5566.84] when that glucose gets to the brain you
[5564.68 - 5569.88] think more clear now what they're doing
[5566.84 - 5571.84] is they're avoiding all food altoe so
[5569.88 - 5574.08] they're avoiding the fats they're not
[5571.84 - 5576.52] having the fats anymore but they're
[5574.08 - 5579.28] having the caffeine so now they're
[5576.52 - 5581.56] running on adrenaline and they think
[5579.28 - 5584.12] more clear in the moment but this is
[5581.56 - 5586.12] robbing Peter to pay Paul again because
[5584.12 - 5589.60] in the end you get burnout
[5586.12 - 5592.32] neurotransmitter burnout neuron burnout
[5589.60 - 5594.36] brain deficiencies you lose even
[5592.32 - 5596.72] precious resources like melatonin in
[5594.36 - 5599.52] your brain and you just slowly burn out
[5596.72 - 5602.24] over time anxiety creeps up depression
[5599.52 - 5604.28] creeps up and then you break and you end
[5602.24 - 5607.12] up quitting your intermittent fasting
[5604.28 - 5609.44] program how do we nourish ourselves how
[5607.12 - 5612.68] do we give our body what it needs all
[5609.44 - 5615.04] the nutrients all the glucose all the
[5612.68 - 5617.20] trace mineral salts how do we fuel
[5615.04 - 5620.24] ourselves so we can function without
[5617.20 - 5622.56] being jacked up on a drug like caffeine
[5620.24 - 5625.28] how can we give ourselves the nutrients
[5622.56 - 5628.80] we need to power us through the day but
[5625.28 - 5631.04] yet not get sick instead reverse our
[5628.80 - 5633.28] conditions and our symptoms and live our
[5631.04 - 5636.00] life to the the best of its ability and
[5633.28 - 5638.96] not have to be on a stimulant how can we
[5636.00 - 5641.80] do it in a kind way a kind way to our
[5638.96 - 5645.64] body kind way for our children our
[5641.80 - 5648.52] parents our friends our loved ones we
[5645.64 - 5651.80] don't naturally come into this world and
[5648.52 - 5654.16] someday say I don't want to be a fireman
[5651.80 - 5656.28] I want to be an intermittent faster I
[5654.16 - 5658.96] don't want to be a school teacher I want
[5656.28 - 5661.56] to be an intermittent fasting person no
[5658.96 - 5663.56] I want to intermittent fast hey I'm in
[5661.56 - 5665.52] fifth grade right now hey do you guys
[5663.56 - 5667.48] want an intermittent fast someday where
[5665.52 - 5669.20] you don't eat all your fun foods and
[5667.48 - 5671.72] don't eat pizza and anything else and
[5669.20 - 5675.20] breakfast is what do you mean no more
[5671.72 - 5678.44] waffles in the morning Lego myo no more
[5675.20 - 5680.96] that uh no more cereal yeah no we're
[5678.44 - 5683.64] just going to starve ourselves all day
[5680.96 - 5686.24] long until the end of the day at night
[5683.64 - 5688.04] really does that sound like a good idea
[5686.24 - 5689.96] yeah that's what we're going to do I'm
[5688.04 - 5692.20] going to go to college and someday be an
[5689.96 - 5693.76] intermittent fasting person and when I
[5692.20 - 5695.68] go out to lunch with my friend in
[5693.76 - 5698.48] college I'm going to say well I'm not
[5695.68 - 5701.80] eating until 9:00 tonight that's what I
[5698.48 - 5705.08] aspire to be and do it's not a natural
[5701.80 - 5708.16] process to just withhold food every day
[5705.08 - 5710.52] so how do we do this right to start
[5708.16 - 5712.52] there's not one way to do it everybody's
[5710.52 - 5714.12] different everybody has different
[5712.52 - 5716.36] problems some people have a really
[5714.12 - 5718.76] strong Constitution they haven't been
[5716.36 - 5720.72] taken down by pathogens they don't have
[5718.76 - 5723.68] a lot of heavy metals they don't have a
[5720.72 - 5725.32] lot of toxins and poisons that person
[5723.68 - 5727.64] might just need some celery juice in the
[5725.32 - 5728.64] morning and not have to eat till noon at
[5727.64 - 5730.04] least they're getting their Trace
[5728.64 - 5732.56] mineral salts and a little bit of
[5730.04 - 5734.08] glucose and hydration and then it all
[5732.56 - 5736.00] depends on what time you wake up in the
[5734.08 - 5738.20] morning you might be somebody that wakes
[5736.00 - 5740.32] up really early or somebody that wakes
[5738.20 - 5743.08] up at 10:00 in the morning 11:00 in the
[5740.32 - 5745.04] morning that changes the game too if you
[5743.08 - 5747.20] wake up really early you start your day
[5745.04 - 5749.60] early and you go to work you're going to
[5747.20 - 5752.72] need some glucose eventually so you
[5749.60 - 5755.32] might need some fruit or smoothie so not
[5752.72 - 5757.68] just celery juice or cucumber juice or
[5755.32 - 5760.36] just lemon water you might need all of
[5757.68 - 5763.24] it and then some apples along the way to
[5760.36 - 5767.04] take you to noon what you want to do is
[5763.24 - 5770.64] leave out the fats no nuts no seeds no
[5767.04 - 5775.00] nut Butters no oils no coconut oil no
[5770.64 - 5778.28] MCT oil no eggs dairy products Meats
[5775.00 - 5780.88] chickens keep the fats completely out at
[5778.28 - 5783.76] least before noon you're not bombarding
[5780.88 - 5786.32] your blood BL stream with all that fat
[5783.76 - 5789.76] fat blocks the sugar from getting into
[5786.32 - 5792.56] your cells fat blocks the glucose from
[5789.76 - 5795.32] getting to your brain fat creates the
[5792.56 - 5797.04] insulin resistance not the sugar and
[5795.32 - 5800.36] that's a mistake made with intermittent
[5797.04 - 5803.28] FS they don't know this so they withhold
[5800.36 - 5806.00] all food starving their brain starving
[5803.28 - 5808.80] their body starving their liver their
[5806.00 - 5810.68] bloodstream loses the glucose what
[5808.80 - 5813.28] people don't think about is their heart
[5810.68 - 5816.24] is a muscle muscle their muscles need
[5813.28 - 5818.12] glucose it's critical but if there's no
[5816.24 - 5820.12] glucose because you're holding back all
[5818.12 - 5822.84] the food you're starving yourself from
[5820.12 - 5824.68] the sugars you need then your heart is
[5822.84 - 5827.32] not getting the glucose the sugar it
[5824.68 - 5830.04] needs to feed itself your heart gets
[5827.32 - 5831.88] stressed your brain gets stressed your
[5830.04 - 5833.24] liver gets stressed your body gets
[5831.88 - 5834.84] stressed and this is something
[5833.24 - 5837.00] intermittent faster don't realize
[5834.84 - 5838.76] they're doing but at the same time
[5837.00 - 5840.92] they're feeling a little better because
[5838.76 - 5843.48] they're not eating so much garbage and
[5840.92 - 5847.84] so much fat throughout the day so the
[5843.48 - 5851.32] goal is to cleanse detox restore renew
[5847.84 - 5854.32] cells for real get nutrients to them get
[5851.32 - 5856.12] sugar to the brain sugar to the heart
[5854.32 - 5858.64] get mineral salts to the brain and
[5856.12 - 5861.00] nervous system all of this while being
[5858.64 - 5863.40] productive living your life not
[5861.00 - 5865.48] overburdening your liver not tanking out
[5863.40 - 5867.04] on fat all day meaning you're eating
[5865.48 - 5869.40] fatty foods throughout the day not
[5867.04 - 5871.64] realizing it and getting insulin
[5869.40 - 5873.76] resistance instead you're you're getting
[5871.64 - 5875.72] better workouts fueling your heart
[5873.76 - 5879.04] fueling your muscles fueling your brain
[5875.72 - 5880.80] and nervous system and being productive
[5879.04 - 5883.40] now listen there's a lot of ways to do
[5880.80 - 5885.12] this good ways to do it right so many
[5883.40 - 5886.40] different options you might be that
[5885.12 - 5889.24] person that doesn't want to eat till
[5886.40 - 5890.88] four or six but yet you need some kind
[5889.24 - 5893.08] of fuel but yet you don't want to
[5890.88 - 5895.20] actually eat food well then that's when
[5893.08 - 5897.36] the juices come in that's when coconut
[5895.20 - 5899.36] water comes in that's when lemon water
[5897.36 - 5901.60] comes in you could always do the lemon
[5899.36 - 5904.96] water and then into celery juice or
[5901.60 - 5908.24] cucumber juice then into coconut water
[5904.96 - 5909.80] and then do that until 4 or 6 but that's
[5908.24 - 5911.96] only if you're somebody with a strong
[5909.80 - 5914.32] Constitution you're kind of used to not
[5911.96 - 5915.96] eating that much food or fuel but what
[5914.32 - 5918.00] if you're somebody that's sick and you
[5915.96 - 5920.08] got a lot of neurological symptoms and
[5918.00 - 5921.88] you need more fuel or you're up against
[5920.08 - 5925.00] a lot of stress now here's a little
[5921.88 - 5926.92] disclaimer there's lots of options
[5925.00 - 5929.68] because that's the whole point it's not
[5926.92 - 5931.44] one size fits all each person is at a
[5929.68 - 5933.28] different place in their life there are
[5931.44 - 5935.12] people that they got to eat something
[5933.28 - 5938.28] every hour because of their adrenal
[5935.12 - 5940.28] glands their adrenals are shot they have
[5938.28 - 5942.72] to make sure they fuel themselves every
[5940.28 - 5945.00] hour hour and a half and then there's
[5942.72 - 5946.48] people who do want to eat fat at some
[5945.00 - 5948.56] point during the day they don't know it
[5946.48 - 5951.24] but they feel like satiated on some type
[5948.56 - 5952.76] of chicken or meat and it's the fat
[5951.24 - 5955.52] that's kind of giving them that
[5952.76 - 5957.12] satiation at night well save those fats
[5955.52 - 5959.76] to the end of the day that could be a
[5957.12 - 5961.64] whole another person where all day long
[5959.76 - 5963.72] you're doing lemon water water your
[5961.64 - 5966.12] celery juice then your coconut water
[5963.72 - 5968.48] then a fruit smoothie then a salad baby
[5966.12 - 5970.16] with steamed potato and then at the very
[5968.48 - 5973.28] end of the night you have your animal
[5970.16 - 5976.60] protein or your plant fats or something
[5973.28 - 5978.12] like avocado salad again or you have
[5976.60 - 5980.32] something else like a nut butter if
[5978.12 - 5982.16] that's what you live on that you love
[5980.32 - 5984.20] everybody's different there's so many
[5982.16 - 5986.40] different options say you're somebody
[5984.20 - 5988.84] that gets up and coconut water works
[5986.40 - 5991.32] good for you so you can do a lot of that
[5988.84 - 5993.64] and then you're not big on fruit so do
[5991.32 - 5995.64] some oatmeal can do some maple syrup or
[5993.64 - 5998.24] honey in your oatmeal but don't do the
[5995.64 - 6000.36] nut milks the nut Butters don't put the
[5998.24 - 6002.56] fat on top of the oatmeal cuz that's
[6000.36 - 6004.16] when you get in trouble and then if you
[6002.56 - 6006.28] do like a little bit of fruit you can
[6004.16 - 6008.96] always put some berries and other pieces
[6006.28 - 6010.32] of fruit on your oatmeal if you'd like
[6008.96 - 6012.52] that might be able to carry you to
[6010.32 - 6015.24] lunchtime or after if you're somebody
[6012.52 - 6017.52] that's trying not to eat as much at
[6015.24 - 6019.48] least you got some kind of fuel to fuel
[6017.52 - 6021.60] your brain and fuel your bloodstream
[6019.48 - 6023.08] with all the glucose you need and then
[6021.60 - 6025.16] you might be able to do some steamed
[6023.08 - 6028.24] vegetables that day and some steamed
[6025.16 - 6030.28] vegetables on top of a salad of greens
[6028.24 - 6033.04] leafy greens so you're getting all your
[6030.28 - 6035.76] mineral salts but on that salad don't
[6033.04 - 6038.48] put oils don't put avocado don't put
[6035.76 - 6040.28] chicken don't put fish don't put Bean on
[6038.48 - 6042.76] there don't put eggs on there you don't
[6040.28 - 6045.48] want a fat on there remember you're
[6042.76 - 6048.16] keeping the fats out if you don't want
[6045.48 - 6050.92] to be fat free for the day the fats come
[6048.16 - 6053.08] later at the end of the day if you're if
[6050.92 - 6055.28] you're an animal protein person that's
[6053.08 - 6058.96] when you apply the animal proteins
[6055.28 - 6061.08] because animal proteins equal animal fat
[6058.96 - 6063.36] so at the end of the day your animal fat
[6061.08 - 6066.56] comes in then if you're a plant-based
[6063.36 - 6068.40] person plant fats comes at the end of
[6066.56 - 6071.56] the day that means if you're somebody
[6068.40 - 6074.36] that always eats nut butter or avocado
[6071.56 - 6076.64] you're bringing those in later on your
[6074.36 - 6078.64] last meal of the day really preferably
[6076.64 - 6081.44] so you're doing your intermittent
[6078.64 - 6083.28] fasting in a way you're doing the thing
[6081.44 - 6085.44] that you avoid it all day which is the
[6083.28 - 6087.28] fats but you do it at night at the end
[6085.44 - 6089.76] of the day but this is the healthier
[6087.28 - 6092.36] version because all day long you're
[6089.76 - 6094.80] getting fuel and the things you need a
[6092.36 - 6096.36] lot of influencers are adopting medical
[6094.80 - 6099.08] medium tools with their intermittent
[6096.36 - 6100.84] fasting programs they all drink celery
[6099.08 - 6102.76] juice in the morning and then they drink
[6100.84 - 6105.00] their coffee all day long and have their
[6102.76 - 6107.52] meals at the end of the day the celery
[6105.00 - 6109.48] juice is carrying them helping them
[6107.52 - 6111.08] bringing things back to them that's why
[6109.48 - 6113.08] they're doing it the sodium sodium
[6111.08 - 6114.80] cluster salts and celery juice are
[6113.08 - 6117.28] feeding their brain their
[6114.80 - 6119.48] neurotransmitters their neurons it's
[6117.28 - 6121.16] making them stronger while they're doing
[6119.48 - 6123.24] something that's not good for them like
[6121.16 - 6125.04] caffeine all day the celery juice is
[6123.24 - 6127.96] allowing them to do more of the things
[6125.04 - 6129.48] that aren't helpful at the same time the
[6127.96 - 6132.12] celery juice is restoring their
[6129.48 - 6135.00] hydrochloric acid reserves because their
[6132.12 - 6136.64] stomach glands are depleted of HCL it's
[6135.00 - 6139.84] part of what contributes to their
[6136.64 - 6141.88] bloating and then a lot of them have
[6139.84 - 6144.96] bacteria problems in their gut bad
[6141.88 - 6146.96] bacteria strepto coctus that contributes
[6144.96 - 6150.24] to the bloating as well and the celery
[6146.96 - 6152.60] juice is killing off the bad bacteria
[6150.24 - 6154.96] lowering the amounts of bad bacteria
[6152.60 - 6157.20] they have in their gut and then the
[6154.96 - 6159.56] celery juice is also knocking other
[6157.20 - 6161.84] pathogens down a lot of people have the
[6159.56 - 6164.00] epine bar and the lowgrade viral
[6161.84 - 6166.36] infections so they got a little bit of
[6164.00 - 6168.04] that mild fatigue and they got a little
[6166.36 - 6170.20] bit of aches and pains and they don't
[6168.04 - 6172.88] feel good so the celery juice is
[6170.20 - 6176.40] knocking down down the viral load and
[6172.88 - 6179.36] the bacterial load and restoring the HCL
[6176.40 - 6182.00] and at the same time the celery juice is
[6179.36 - 6184.84] bringing bile reserves back restoring
[6182.00 - 6187.20] the liver and helping them cleanse all
[6184.84 - 6189.20] that's happening from their daily celery
[6187.20 - 6190.64] juice every single day but then they
[6189.20 - 6193.04] still tell everybody they're
[6190.64 - 6195.24] intermittent fasting and the credit goes
[6193.04 - 6197.00] to the intermittent fasting but they
[6195.24 - 6199.32] don't tell someone they're doing the
[6197.00 - 6200.52] celery juice so the next person says
[6199.32 - 6202.60] well I'm going to do the intermittent
[6200.52 - 6204.92] fact fting and they don't do any celery
[6202.60 - 6206.96] juice if you're looking to customize an

[6324.52 - 6328.68] before we get to the ending of the show
[6326.68 - 6331.56] just want to leave you with one last
[6328.68 - 6334.12] thought when we're intermittent fasting
[6331.56 - 6336.96] we're doing it on planet Earth we're
[6334.12 - 6341.00] doing it here in this solar system this
[6336.96 - 6343.68] planet is the size it is takes 24 hours
[6341.00 - 6346.24] for it to revolve and turn for the sun
[6343.68 - 6348.72] to rise and the sun to
[6346.24 - 6352.44] rise think about being in a different
[6348.72 - 6355.28] solar system on another planet and what
[6352.44 - 6357.08] would intermittent fasting be like there
[6355.28 - 6360.44] what if it was a planet that was larger
[6357.08 - 6364.16] than the earth very well could be and it
[6360.44 - 6368.52] took 48 hours for that sunrise for that
[6364.16 - 6370.56] sun to rise or took longer and what
[6368.52 - 6373.20] would it be like during the day as
[6370.56 - 6376.32] you're intermittent fasting instead of
[6373.20 - 6378.96] fasting for 12 hours and not eating food
[6376.32 - 6383.92] before you eat your dinner you might be
[6378.96 - 6386.36] waiting 20 hours or maybe even 30 hours
[6383.92 - 6390.28] just wanted to leave you with that last
[6386.36 - 6393.68] note it's easy to be confused about food
[6390.28 - 6397.04] feel stuck about what we are eating feel
[6393.68 - 6400.68] lost about what we are choosing what
[6397.04 - 6404.00] we're trying to avoid the road map to
[6400.68 - 6407.88] Healing is hard when we don't have a
[6404.00 - 6410.96] clue it's not our fault everyone going
[6407.88 - 6414.04] through a struggle ends up scrambling
[6410.96 - 6416.08] it's true when you're young and strong
[6414.04 - 6418.64] and haven't been in the shoes of someone
[6416.08 - 6422.24] who has been there who's been deeply
[6418.64 - 6425.28] wronged and is really sick and what you
[6422.24 - 6427.76] reference in your life isn't what they
[6425.28 - 6431.32] the really sick have referenced in their
[6427.76 - 6434.52] life it's like the wild west out there
[6431.32 - 6438.48] in the world of Health everyone who's
[6434.52 - 6441.24] Alpha and their ego won't back down and
[6438.48 - 6444.36] they are not yet affected by sick
[6441.24 - 6447.00] and try to make a name for themselves
[6444.36 - 6449.96] not all are like this though there are
[6447.00 - 6452.40] Angels Among the masses and there are
[6449.96 - 6455.76] beacons of light who have been through
[6452.40 - 6459.56] hell and back and have every right to
[6455.76 - 6461.92] preach and teach classes wise ones that
[6459.56 - 6465.20] fought their way out of the woods broke
[6461.92 - 6467.64] out of unwellness left the darkness and
[6465.20 - 6470.48] then became reborn with purpose and
[6467.64 - 6473.20] knowledge and of great compassion for
[6470.48 - 6476.32] the ones that have been misled All Along
[6473.20 - 6479.72] The Path they know what it was to feel
[6476.32 - 6482.48] barely alive and just about half dead
[6479.72 - 6485.00] but have more words of wisdom now than
[6482.48 - 6488.52] anything said in the trendy Health realm
[6485.00 - 6491.48] of games that mess with people's heads
[6488.52 - 6494.36] remember these words for they are tall
[6491.48 - 6498.08] and the truth derails the darkness so it
[6494.36 - 6501.52] doesn't stay above all the confusion and
[6498.08 - 6503.64] delusion the medicine delusion
[6501.52 - 6507.68] creates its own
[6503.64 - 6511.00] downfall and all that's good and healing
[6507.68 - 6513.66] sits in your hands and allows what you
[6511.00 - 6516.74] wanted all
[6513.66 - 6516.74] [Music]
[6529.20 - 6532.20] along
