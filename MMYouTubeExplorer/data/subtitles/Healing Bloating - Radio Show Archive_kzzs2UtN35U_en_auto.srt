17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,039
misinformation and disinformation all

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,440

everywhere in the books and the internet

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,199
our life we lose 10 years of time we

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
could have gotten better or could have

23
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:54,199
gotten so much better to a point where a

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
higher quality of life a better quality

25
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,160
of life I've seen people have anxiety of

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,559
the most crippling crippling anxiety or

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,640
depression and it and if they and they

28
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,320
they went through it through life and

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
then they got it better and they got it

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,240
better doing some things that we have in

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,759
the medical medium series books and

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
everything else and they were just like

33
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,960
oh my God if I only knew this years ago

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,119
what would I've done I mean if I only

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,479
knew about the celery juice how it

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,400
reduced my anxiety and just took it down

37
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,520
from level eight level 10 down to level

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,240
one to level zero I mean it's things

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,400
like that the whole point is Advanced

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,200
information to make sure

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
that you can move forward healing and

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
and and actually you know beat Decades

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,720
of time that research and science

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,960
doesn't know about things out there it's

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,799
crazy look at what celery juice this is

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,920
one example of the medical medium series

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,079
look at what celery juice is doing for

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,119
Millions globally now that we've we got

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,399
it out there that we actually that

50
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,280
Spirit put the information out there

51
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,280
look what it's doing it's unbelievable

52
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,280
okay and there's no research in science

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,600
at all has that's attached to it

54
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,920
whatsoever in fact you'll even see

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,680
articles now they just totally

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,399
conventional articles and whatnot and in

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,119
media like what is this celery juice

58
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,039
cleanse I mean the celery juice trend is

59
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,160
it good is it bad what is it they don't

60
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,239
even have a clue no one even has a clue

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
it's

62
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:17,360
unbelievable and so if if research and

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,239
science is what you're relying on in

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,879
chronic illness on any level it's it's

65
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,599
not a really good thing it's not a

66
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,480
really good thing with mystery chronic

67
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,800
illness it's not because it's a whole

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,480
that's the whole point and that's an

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
advanced that's an advanced piece of

70
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,480
information

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,879
so many and I'm talking about celery

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
juice for a reason because today's topic

74
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,120
is bloating we're talking about

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,640
bloating very important like why do we

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
on it this is going to it's going to be

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,640
all about bloating on this talk it's

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,040
very important so the bottom line is

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,000

everything to do with live a rescue and

112
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,120

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,480

118
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,640
me as long as you're healing and that's

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,239
the whole point so let's go into

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,480
bloating let's talk about this it's an

121
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,639
important thing because research and

122
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,799
sign still knows nothing about bloating

123
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,080
nothing it's what you're going to find

124
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,720
out there it's like not just the wild

125
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,360
west but it's really just like the

126
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,600
information out there is what I'm saying

127
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,039
is it's try this try that eat this way

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,840
everybody's got a new fangle diet a

129
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,400
trendy diet they got this this take out

130
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,560
processed foods take out gluten and yeah

131
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,039
that does help you take out gluten and

132
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,479
sometimes people lose their bloating

133
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,960
absolutely you take out dairy products

134
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,320
sometimes they lose their bloating but

135
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,440
it's not as simple as that for so many

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,720
people and why were they bloating if

137
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,360
they were bloating to gluten why why

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,520
were they bloating if they were and if

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,000
you're sitting out there saying well

140
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,240
what about lectin he's not talking about

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,520
lectin he doesn't have advanced

142
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,919
information first of all that's not

143
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,639
Advanced information lectin second of

144
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,800
all the lectin theory is completely all

145
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,479
wrong completely all wrong that's the

146
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,840
other thing in fact I talk about that in

147
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,600
Liver Rescue the whole lectin thing is

148
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,039
completely wrong there's lectin in every

149
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
fruit and every vegetable so you know

150
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,160
what don't eat any fruits and vegetables

151
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,319
don't see where it gets you see where it

152
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,880
gets you don't eat any fruits don't eat

153
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,479
any vegetables don't eat don't eat any

154
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,240
of that and just because you want to

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,800
avoid eltin see where that gets you I

156
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,479
can't even tell you how many holes are

157
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
in the lectin thing you don't even know

158
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,360
you don't even you got to read LI or

159
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,520
rescue to even know and but you know the

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,400
whole thing there's a lot of proteins

161
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,000
there's a lot of proteins that are more

162
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,319
destructive than

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,759
lectins they're way more destructive and

164
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,639
they're not in fruits and vegetables the

165
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,800
lectins are actually harmless it's other

166
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
proteins that the science and research

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,919
don't even have mapped out there's so

168
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,680
many proteins in in Grain in certain

169
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
grain and I'm going even talk talking

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
about the whole gluten thing there's

171
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,360
just so many proteins and and those are

172
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,080
disturbing because what they do is they

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
feed like gluten does they feed

174
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,800
pathogens which guess what guess what

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,199
nobody knows in the any of the medical

176
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,080
communities and I'm telling you that now

177
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,400
so you can be this is all about arming

178
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,960
you and making sure you become the

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,479
expert if I come off as like a pain in

180
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,120
the butt and I come off where you know

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,639
sarcastic or whatever it is I come off a

182
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,520
little Brash whatever it is it's only

183
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,280
because I want you to become an

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,960
expert because if I'm not a good teacher

185
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,759
and I don't I don't maybe I suck as a

186
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,800
teacher maybe I totally suck as a

187
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,400
teacher I'm doing the best I can but I'm

188
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,440
trying to be a good teacher so that you

189
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,720
get the information you become the

190
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,960
expert that you need to be and and

191
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,000
that's just the bottom line and so what

192
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,880
happens is with like gluten it feeds

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
pathogens it feeds viruses it feeds

194
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,639
viruses like Epstein bar it feeds

195
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
viruses like all the different viruses

196
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
hhv6 it feeds all that stuff strap the

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,000
bacteria and

198
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,080
everything it feeds all those things and

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,840
then and then now that's one of the

200
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,199
reasons why people bloat if you got

201
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,440
strep if you got a little acne and

202
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,319
everything and you're eating gluten or

203
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,840
you're eating something you're not

204
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,000
supposed to be eating dairy or eggs or

205
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,919
anything Dairy eggs whatever like I said

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,440
milk cheese butter yogurt kefir whatever

207
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,520
it is you know Lamb's milk I don't know

208
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,759
what people drink anymore sheep's milk

209
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,080
the whole bit it Whatever It Is goats

210
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,000
milk and if you're if you're

211
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,479
actually you know if you're actually

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,479
eating any of that and and you're

213
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,160
bloating up yeah of course that's

214
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,039
because you're you're you're feeding a

215
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,520
pathogen you're feeding strep in the gut

216
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,560
you're feeding strep inside the gut

217
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,520
that's the whole point so the bottom

218
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,879
line is it's about getting you better

219
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,800
it's about making sure that you're in

220
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,879
the right situation with all of this and

221
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,159
having the right information and and

222
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,319
that's a piece of it all on its own cuz

223
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,479
you know what research and Science and

224
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
everything else doesn't even know about

225
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,159
what's happening with with gluten alone

226
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,360
feeding bugs and what kind of bugs and

227
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,039
everything about it so it isn't just

228
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,479
like the gluten thing it isn't just like

229
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,680
that and it's more it's much more than

230
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,840
that we're going to go into depth about

231
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,080
it all because someone can eat all the

232
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,599
bread and gluten they want yeah if they

233
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,800
don't have all kinds of viruses or they

234
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,960
don't have a good strep in their

235
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,120
intestinal tract that's sitting there

236
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
feeding on it all the time you know

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,520
giving more bloating or other situations

238
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,360
like that or any kind of symptom

239
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,000
constipation any kind of cramping pain

240
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,159
whatever it is if if if if it's not just

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,520
that basically what I'm trying to say is

242
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,080
there's people that can eat anything

243
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,800
they want they're not getting bloating

244
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,919
but they eventually will and they

245
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,360
eventually do no one escapes bloating no

246
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:37,519
one does unless they actually

247
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,399
repair what has gone wrong for so many

248
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,959
years it has everything to do with the

249
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:45,279
liver you know children bloat they bloat

250
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,920
from the very beginning because of the

251
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,360
liver and then because of also pathogens

252
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,440
like strep and everything else and

253
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,320
children have these pathogens absolutely

254
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,279
and they bloat and and they get weak

255
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,800
hydrochloric acid very weak digestion

256
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,440
very weak digestion and it can happen

257
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,720
when you're younger and there could be

258
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,120
people that are not bloating they don't

259
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,360
bloat they don't bloat and they just go

260
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,120
through life but they'll bloat

261
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,800
eventually everybody will no matter who

262
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,079
it is

263
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,680
everybody will because you're going to

264
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,200
be doing something wrong with their diet

265
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
and whatever their constitution is

266
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,480
meaning in a sense where they they don't

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,760
have a lot of bugs their liver was

268
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,399
strong to begin with and their liver

269
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,399
didn't actually break down over the time

270
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
over the years fast enough or like some

271
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,079
people it breaks down because of stress

272
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,720
High adrenaline adrenaline flooding into

273
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:32,519
the liver and then it breaks down over

274
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,399
time and some people less stress with

275
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,240
less adrenaline you know all kinds of

276
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,200
different things like that uh different

277
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
resources different Lifestyles whatever

278
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,760
it is and whatever it is the bloating is

279
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,240
going to come it's going to come it's

280
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,399
going to it just is I've been in this

281
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,120
long enough over 30 years just just

282
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:52,839
practicing alone helping people just

283
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,680
oneon-one over the years never mind

284
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,279
doing the books and then years later

285
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,760
doing the books and all the information

286
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,519
we put out and everything like that that

287
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,920
I put out that spirit and I put out when

288
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,079
I say we it's you know spirit and I

289
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,240
putting it out the thing is is that the

290
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,200
bottom line the bottom line is for you

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,600
to understand one thing that's so

292
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:16,399
important and everybody will

293
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,720
bloat whether anybody likes it or not

294
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,920
unless you know what's going on unless

295
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,560
you know why unless you repair the hands

296
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,320
of time unless you repair and go back

297
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
and repair the hands of time and by

298
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,560
doing that is guess what making good to

299
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,800
the liver making good with the liver and

300
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,720
making sure that the diet is Right long

301
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,480
enough with the right things and tools

302
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,240
in there making sure you're healing the

303
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,600
right things long enough even if you're

304
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,839
doing some caman trendy thing out there

305
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,240
whatever and it helped your bloating and

306
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,160
you stopped this and you stopped eating

307
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,440
that for a little while and your

308
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,040
bloating started getting better whatever

309
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,279
it is the bloating will come back it

310
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,480
just does it does it does unless you do

311
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,320
what you you need to do unless you know

312
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,959
what's going really going on with the

313
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,800
liver the bloating comes back if you

314
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,120
think everybody's immune to bloating

315
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,519
except for you if you think people are

316
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,880
walking around immune to bloating except

317
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,320
for you you're

318
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:13,959
wrong drastically drastically wrong no

319
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:18,000
one is immune to bloating no one gets a

320
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:21,760
free get out of bloating card jail card

321
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,240
free whatever no one does I'm being

322
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,880
straight up I'm telling you right now

323
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,839
I'm being straight up so the bottom line

324
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,079
is let's let's go into this a little bit

325
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,519
let's talk about it when the liver

326
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,560
weakens okay when the liver weakens and

327
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,680
becomes sluggish a sluggish liver that's

328
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,639
right in any way such as when pathogens

329
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,240
like EBV and poisons like toxic heavy

330
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:49,360
metals come to visit or when fatty liver

331
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,040
develops it produces lower quality bile

332
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,279
so it's all about the

333
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,839
bile you know and hey look you know in

334
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,920
real estate it's all about the location

335
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,279
it's all about the location all about

336
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,720
the location whatever that's what you

337
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:07,639
hear it's all about that and um and with

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,600
the liver and with

339
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,160
bloing it's all about

340
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,079
bile that's what it's about so just just

341
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,720
remember that really important thing to

342
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,360
know cuz we're going into this right now

343
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:24,639
we're going to go deep into this but

344
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:28,639
it's all about that so listen the bottom

345
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,040
line is this is not a proud situation

346
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,199
for your liver when it weakens it's

347
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,560
not because the liver the liver lobules

348
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,360
these little little little cell

349
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,920
structures inside the liver they're all

350
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,320
about quality

351
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,120
control they're all about quality of

352
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,199
bile they're all about quality and

353
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,920
quantity that's what they're all about

354
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:57,680
so if the liver is releasing bile that's

355
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,120
less than that's less than it truly is a

356
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,959
sign that it's old overburdened and how

357
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,399
would you know how would you know and it

358
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,880
doesn't matter what kind of fancy diet

359
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
someone's giving you out there whatever

360
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,360
and blah blah this that diet

361
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,120
whatever you know diet for your blood

362
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,000
diet for this diet for that whatever's

363
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,040
going on out there is it really about

364
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,880
your B does anybody even know what's

365
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,760
going on and what's happening in there

366
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:28,399
yeah and so the bottom line is so if the

367
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:32,839
liver is releasing bile that's less than

368
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,120
it's truly ass signed sign that it's

369
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,000
overburdened that it's

370
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
overburdened so even when compromised

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,240
even when the liver's compromised it's

372
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,720
using every single Reserve every single

373
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:50,079
source of energy it has to produce the

374
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,079
strongest bile it possibly can and I'll

375
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,920
tell you why because everybody's on a

376
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:59,519
high fat diet I'm sorry but everybody's

377
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,240
on a high fat diet you don't you don't

378
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,600
know you're on a high fat diet call it

379
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,720

380
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,920
protein diet hey are you on a high

381
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,320
protein diet turning my head different

382
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,320
ways are you on a high protein

383
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,279
diet yeah because if you're on a high

384
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,320
protein diet that's a high fat diet

385
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:22,639
that's a high fat diet that's what that

386
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,560
is sorry sorry about this news sorry

I got a lot to learn I still have a lot

408
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,839
to

409
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,240
learn still the liver has 2,000 over

410
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,880
2,000 undiscovered chemical functions to

411
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,600
perform and some of them okay go into

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,079
the immune support and they're more

413
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,600
important than

414
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:29,079
bile they're more important than bile so

415
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,800
the bile will weaken and bile is

416
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:33,519
important but it'll weaken because your

417
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,720
immune system is more important

418
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
especially if you're dealing with

419
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,639
pathogens like everybody else and I'm

420
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,000
going to say it right now I don't care

421
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,440
who you are where you come from what

422
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,759
part of the planet you're on I don't

423
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,000
care if you're an alien from another

424
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,199
planet and you landed on a spacecraft

425
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,639
the other day you got a pathogen inside

426
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:55,319
the liver everybody has pathogens inside

427
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,959
the liver you can't not have pathogens

428
00:15:55,319 --> 00:16:02,560
inside your liver it would be bizarre it

429
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,959
would be clearly bizarre if you if you

430
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
actually didn't have pathogens in the

431
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:07,600
liver because even if you had strep one

432
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
time in your life or didn't even know

433
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,480
you have it it's causing a little bit of

434
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,880
acne it's inside the liver that's just

435
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:20,759
one of just dozens of of

436
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,959
possibilities so lower levels of less

437
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,639
powerful

438
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,519
bile mean the breaking down of food

439
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:31,399
becomes a

440
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,199
problem but what kind of food what's the

441
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,000

burdened already if you don't have two

492
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,120
varieties of Epstein bar sitting in

493
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,679
there that caus Hashim Modas when you're

494
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,159
50 years old or you don't have you know

495
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,640
something else going on there that's not

496
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,880
causing something or two varieties of

497
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,200
strep because you had strep throat years

498
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
ago and you get UTI periodically in your

499
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,039
life you got all the strep inside the

500
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,080
liver cyto egler virus hhp 6s which are

501
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,799
all in there it's Rosas when people you

502
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,880
know when kids get Rosas little babies

503
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,039
or they get Ros Olas and they get jais

504
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,520
because they got they got hhv6 in their

505
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,120
liver sitting there their whole lifetime

506
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,080
that's how it works and in the liver get

507
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,200
sluggish and SL you can kill viruses too

508
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,360
why do you think I put out thyroid

509
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
healing the book thyroid healing if you

510
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,880
don't have a copy of that get a copy of

511
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,720
thyroid

512
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,520
healing you get if if yeah get a copy

513
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,120
can't afford it go to the library

514
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,480
whatever but the bottom line is is that

515
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,640
all the stuff is inside the liver then

516
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,240
you got Mercury lead arsenic cadmium

517
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,080
copper nickel steel Chrome Alloys you

518
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,840
get all this metal titanium everything

519
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,039
sitting inside the liver titanium yeah

520
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,760
where where'd you get titanium where'd

521
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,640
you get that I mean is it dental

522
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,400
implants or is it Pharmaceuticals over

523
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,320
the years because they're loaded with

524
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,799
titanium Pharmaceuticals antibiotics at

525
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
petroleum they're petroleum based they

526
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,760
got Metals in it too petroleum is not

527
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
necessarily metal but what I'm saying is

528
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,280
they also have Metals in it too they got

529
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
all that

530
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,360
I mean Pharmaceuticals aren't screened

531
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,600
for all this stuff they even add it in

532
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,679
there goes into the liver fills up in

533
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,320
the liver detergents air fresheners

534
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,200
colog perfumes gasoline at the gas

535
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,640
station you're pumping every single day

536
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,240
Foods preservatives junk you've eaten 20

537
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,080
years ago it's all still inside the

538
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,640
liver every last bit of it every last

539
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,039
bit of it is inside the liver smoke from

540
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,799
a bombfire from treated wood gas grill

541
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,960
gas stoves and you can't run from some

542
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,440
of this you got to live with some of

543
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,640

639
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,760
handy wipes and I wipe the I wipe the

640
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,960

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,320
something another thing too if I do too

642
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,320
many readings like that I go blind

643
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,919
anyway you guys know my story and then I

644
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,440
can't pick out what I need to pick out I

645
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:48,640
try to go to the store when if I ever go

646
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,880
to a store I try to go early the less

647
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,840
people the less readings I get instantly

648
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,200
from Spirit the less chances I go snow

649
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,880
blind and so I can pick out my mangoes

650
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,880
and my tomatoes and get my frozen Wild

651
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,520
blueberries and get all the things that

652
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,400
I need and get my lettu uses and get my

653
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,679
kale and get everything else I need and

654
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,279
I could get it in time before I start

655
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,600
losing my eyesight from all the people

656
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,520
coming in in the readings and then if

657
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,000
somebody asked me for reading forget it

658
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,120
then I leave there practically blind I

659
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,120
have to sit in the car and wait it

660
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,279
out the bottom line

661
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,880
is the liver gets filled up sorry about

662
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:28,559

663
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,279
so many poisons and so many toxins and

664
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,799
the

665
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,159
bile breaks down and weakens and then

666
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,919
there's one other thing I have to tell

667
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,679

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,640
never been known to do that I

725
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,320
can't I can't you

726
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,799
know life is precious and we we have no

727
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,799
time to waste

728
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,440
so the deal is is the liver yeah the

729
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,919
bile breaks down and then guess what

730
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,320
happens guess what happens next your

731
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,320
hydrochloric acid has to

732
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,919
overproduce it has to overproduce

733
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:58,320
overproduce the seven blend that science

734
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,559
and research does even know about that I

735
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,600
wrote about in book one medical medium

736
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,240
that I talk about in this Liver Rescue

737
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:10,799
book I talk about it in detail the seven

738
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,120
blend gastric acid okay the gastric acid

739
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,720
this the glands in the stomach to

740
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:18,919
produce all the gastric gastric

741
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,399
acid and and then that weakens and

742
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:23,080
breaks

743
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,840
down and hydrochloric acid breaks down

744
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,919
and you got low HCL it started with your

745
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,320
liver all low HCL starts with your liver

746
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,159
all acid reflux gastric problems gastric

747
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,880
distress everything starts with your

748
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,039
liver everything in the digestive track

749
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,840
starts in your with your

750
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,200
liver your liver someone said to me so

751
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,159
you wrote a book about the liver like

752
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,159
who who cares about

753
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:53,600
[Laughter]

754
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,320
that I couldn't believe I couldn't

755
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,360
believe what I

756
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:04,480
heard I couldn't believe what I heard

757
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:08,120
yeah yeah so anyway okay so bottom line

758
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,480
is hydrochloric acid can weaken and the

759
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:15,799
liver calls out for help and it's

760
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:19,720
bioproduction flags and waines and

761
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,880
waxes excess adrenaline from Life lowers

762
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,120
the hydrochloric acid on top of it the

763
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,720
emotional

764
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,360
everything adrenaline is like a monkey

765
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,600
wrench thrown into a delicate intricate

766
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,159
swish

767
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,640

watch clock Swiss grand grandfather

769
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,760
clock it's like a neighbor dumping a

770
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:45,080
bottle of beer into your pot of soup

771
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,880
simmering on the stove that made that

772
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,360
you made using your grandmother's

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,960
perfect recipe or you found this recipe

776
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,600
that you really really like or you've

777
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,039
made it before and you really like like

778
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,039
it and you got this you got this pot of

779
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,519
soup simmering and it's really a good

780
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:06,080
soup it's a healing soup on top of it

781
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,120
and your neighbor believes that

782
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,760
everything that you you know that you

783
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,360
cook you know that you cook should

784
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,799
should have beer in it should have beer

785
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,039
in it beer on the grill on the chicken

786
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,559
in the sauce the barbecue sauce

787
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,399
marinating in beer whatever doing things

788
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,799
that beer you know that whole beer thing

789
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,760
and the neighbor just dumps a can of

790
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,440
beer in your soup in the kitchen just

791
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,039
but but you know honestly not thinking

792
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,720
they're doing anything harmful and they

793
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,360
know you even like beer maybe but you

794
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,760
you don't want it in your

795
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,120
soup yeah beer by the way lowers the

796
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,559
hydrochloric acid and doesn't help the

797
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,120
liver but you probably figured that one

798
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,960
out already that's not science and

799
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,320
research knows that one so you probably

800
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,760
know about you've heard a little bit

801
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,799
about that out

802
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,559
there so when you lower your bile

803
00:29:53,799 --> 00:30:00,120
production bile salts lower hydrochloric

804
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,399
acid

805
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,440
lowers this is no

806
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:10,039
joke and mineral salts in the seven

807
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,640
blends of your stomach acid go down the

808
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,840
drain all of it falls apart and you

809
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,799
start to

810
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,799
bloat the small intestine isn't able to

811
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,919
absorb the nutrients it's meant to and

812
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,799
proteins start to rot and fats start to

813
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,880
go

814
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,840
rancid proteins start to R

815
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,399
and fats go rancid you want to heal a

816
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,360
digestive problem it's not more protein

817
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,840
more protein more protein like all the

818
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,080
experts

819
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,720
say no it's lowering protein lowering

820
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,480
protein for God's sake lowering

821
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,880
protein it's not increased fats increase

822
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,080
fats increase fats when everything's

823
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,600
going

824
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,840
wrong when your small intestinal tra

825
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,360
when your small intestinal tract is

826
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,639
struggling everything is struggling your

827
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,440
your your hydrochloric acid is is Rock

828
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:03,279
Bottom your bile weakening you don't

829
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,039
raise fats raise overt fats raise overt

830
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,559
fats you don't raise proteins proteins

831
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,360
prot you lower them if there's any

832
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,559
digestive problems whatsoever you have

833
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,240
to lower them and if it ain't fixed yet

834
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,880
that's because you got years of stuff

835
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,840
going on and everybody's got a different

836
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,760
story so it may take a little longer for

837
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,399
that celery juice to work and heal you

838
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,440
and fix you and you have to have

839
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,240
patience

840
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,360
because if you can be a fly on the

841
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,880
in some people's lives and see the

842
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,120
amount of stress or what's going on in

843
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,799
relationships or whatever that's

844
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,440
stressing them out causing adrenals to

845
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,519
run all the time causing their symptoms

846
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,880
to last longer you wouldn't believe it

847
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,720
you're not going to see it on Instagram

848
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,760
because Instagram is fantasy land for a

849
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,600
lot of people not for everybody of

850
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,519
course you know that's Fantasy Land I

851
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,039
mean there people don't even people are

852
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,399
on Instagram some people they don't even

855
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,960
look like I'm I'm eating this I'm eating

00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,519
this I'm eating this and a lot of people

857
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,679
are but there's a lot of people that are

858
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,399
like oh I'm eating this and then they're

859
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,039
eating pizza on the weekend but they

860
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,000
don't show that part on

861
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,679
Instagram and know show that part on

862
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,279
social media I mean you know of course

863
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,320
it's they're right they don't have to I

864
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,919
mean of

865
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,760
course but you know it's it's it's if

866
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,240
you're staying diligent and you're doing

867
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,399
it long enough and you're doing the

868
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,039
right things and you saturate yourself

869
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:23,000
in the medical medium information in the

870
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,919

but a lot of people they're up against a

874
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,760
lot of things a lot more stress some

875
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,559
people are up against so much stress and

876
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,000
heartache that their adrenaline is

877
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,440
running all the time their livers have

878
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
been saturated with it some people are

879
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,039
more viral they got more bacteria issues

880
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,080
inside the liver more viruses inside the

881
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,799
liver some people have done more

882
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,679
Pharmaceuticals than others like tons of

883
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,159
Pharmaceuticals anti-depressants you

884
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,480
name it antibiotics periodically over

885
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,519
the years and they've done like they've

886
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,480
done the medications and that's all a

887
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:55,840
problem

888
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,279
too and some people have done all these

889
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,000

different things going on and some

892
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,919
people had a sluggish liver all the way

893
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,399
from babyhood and they had baby liver I

894
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,600
call it baby liver it's inside Liver

895
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,559
Rescue and you learn all about you know

896
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,279
children's liver conditions children and

897
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:14,000
baby liver and the thing is you have all

898
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:15,480
this going on some people are loaded

899
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,919
with heavy metals inside the liver it's

900
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,279
actually unbelievable and they got all

901
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,039
kinds of medications that have heavy

902
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:21,320
metals in them and and doctor treatments

903
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,679
and stuff like that conventional

904
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,200
doctor's office you name

905
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,679
it and a lot of people had braces where

906
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,279
they have the metal brace bra not like

907
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,519
the invisible line or something not the

908
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,880
not the whatever they have the metal

909
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,880
braces and all the metal just oxidized

910
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,480
you know for 2 years of having braces on

911
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,080
and it started when you're a child or a

912
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,159
teenager whatever and it saturated the

913
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,679
liver and then bloating comes later on

914
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:44,080
the metals are in there the steel and

915
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,080
everything else a stainless steel are

916
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,639
all feeding they're all feeding

917
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,039
pathogens and stuff I mean hey no big

918
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,559
deal you can clean it all up you can

919
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,679
work on these things but everybody has a

920
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,639
different story everybody has a

921
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,799
different thing going on one glass of

922
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,720
celery juice might fix one person one

923
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,159
day absolutely one glass of Cellar juice

924
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,639
is not going to fix another person yet

925
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,880
and they have to do a lot more besides

926
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:03,600
that they have to get all the things

927
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,480
down they have to saturate themselves in

928
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,159
in the information to learn how to bring

929
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,119
back their hydrochloric acid and learn

930
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,800
how to bring back their bile and learn

931
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,599
how to heal and learn how to move

932
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,320
forward and learn how to do

933
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,879
it it's that important it's that

934
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,200
important all of it

935
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,679
matters small intestine isn't able to

936
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,919
absorb the nutrients it's meant to

937
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,000
anymore rancid fats line the intestinal

938
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,079
tract and the colon fats line the gut

939
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,839
they line the gut and they Harbor

940
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,599
pathogens but we're told to keep on

941
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,399
eating protein and we're told to keep on

942
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,079
eating fat it's

943
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,919

966
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,480
to work on it it's you can do it you can

967
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,599
heal you can heal

968
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,920
bloating and sometimes that bloating

969
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,640
sticks around for a lot of people for

970
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,920
quite a while cuz the deeper you detox

971
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,320
the more junk comes out the deeper you

972
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,000
detox when you start shaking and

973
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,760
rattling that liver and all that Gunk

974
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,280
and crap comes out oh my God and it

975
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,560
comes out it's surfacing and floating

976
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,440
around and it gets it's in the

977
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,760
bloodstream and it's floating around

978
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,200
everywhere that alone can get you to

979
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,440
bloat a little bit you better believe it

980
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,560
bloating healing bloating doesn't

981
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,680
necessarily mean the bloating goes away

982
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,800
the day you heal

983
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,480
it you can heal the bloating issue but

984
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,440
but because you're dumping so much out

985
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,960
of the liver on a daily basis you're

986
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,640
going to bloat for a while even after

987
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,760
your bloating has been

988
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,160
healed everybody's different with the

989
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,680
situation everybody's liver is different

990
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,400
so you got to approach it where okay

991
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,560
let's start here 16 ounces of celery

992
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,960
juice let's start right there hey if you

993
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,240
can handle celery juice and you like

994
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,400
celery juice do 32 ounces a day watch

995
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,760
how that really takes it to the next

996
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
level in an amazing way make sure you

997
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,440
have a fat-free morning no matter what

998
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,400
every morning is fat

999
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,319
free 100% fat free 100% what's called

1000
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,280
protein free gotta be careful about that

1001
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,839
because protein means fat in most cases

1002
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,839
in almost all cases and if you're going

1003
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,760
to put a bunch of plant protein like a

1004
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,000
bunch of pea protein in your shake you

1005
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,400
just made yourself a bloating shake my

1006
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,800
God dried peas ground up is that's a

1007
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,319
massive bloater if you don't feel

1008
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
bloated after your shake you'll feel

1009
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:53,480
bloated a week later you won't know what

1010
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,040
it is it's the dried peas you're putting

1011
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,880
in the shake whey protein is really bad

1012
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,040
whey protein powder that's the bloater

1013
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,079
of all bloaters how many people have

1014
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,400
that collagen in shakes that's a bloater

1015
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,040
oh my God the

1016
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,280
bloaters that are in people's shakes too

1017
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,640
all that almond butter all the oh my God

1018
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,839
people put tablespoons of almond butter

1019
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,119
in their shake and they're like well got

1020
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,800
to keep the insulin balance got to keep

1021
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,400
the blood sugar balanc meanwhile you

1022
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,599
just you just totally destroyed your

1023
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,359
blood sugar because you're making

1024
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,480
insulin resistance by making putting all

1025
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,359
that fat inside your shake now if this

1026
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,280
is a foreign land for anybody that's

1027
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,720
listening then you should learn learn

1028
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,240
about the truth and learn about the

1029
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,680
information if you're afraid of it and

1030
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,440
you don't like what I'm saying I'm sorry

1031
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm sorry I mean I do

1032
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:43,440
care I really do care it matters to me

1033
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,599
what happens to you it does if I seem

1034
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,839
insensitive I'm not insensitive to you

1035
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,880
one bit I'm insensitive to the industry

1036
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,200
I'm insensitive to the trends

1037
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,240
Setters the trend setters that that put

1038
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,000
out bogus information

1039
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm I'm insensitive to a lot of

1040
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,440
situations out there that get people in

1041
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,480
trouble so they waste another five years

1042
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,520
another eight

1043
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,920
years you know what I suggest with

1044
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,440
people with bloating is to go plant-

1045
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,839
base for a little while in their life if

1046
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,040
they're afraid to they should but they

1047
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,400
should try it they should try it if

1048
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,920
they're big into animal protein go

1049
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,280
plant-based for a little while

1050
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,480
absolutely totally do

1051
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,119
that if you're afraid to keep some

1052
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,680
animal protein in do it at the end of

1053
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
the day do your animal protein at the

1054
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,240
end of the day and do it only once a day

1055
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,800
if you can start with that then start

1056
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,200
with that and during the day you got to

1057
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,200
bring in mineral salts and leafy greens

1058
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,319
mineral salts and leafy greens cucumber

bloated yeah you might be bloated for a

1068
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,800
while absolutely but you know what

1069
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,240
you're doing you're building you're not

1070
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,319
trying to get a Curative power you're

1071
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,160
not trying to get a Curative antidote to

1072
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,640
cure your bloating in that one minute

1073
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,560
because that's ridiculous what you're

1074
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,160
doing is you're going you're doing this

1075
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,240
so the bloating goes away for good

1076
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,880
because your your liver can't Resto

1077
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,760
restore its bio reserves and bio

1078
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,720
production overnight and the people that

1079
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,839
are even eating really good really

1080
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,400
clean even low fat potatoes at night and

1081
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,720
some shakes and you know like some fruit

1082
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,839
fruit in the morning and a salad for

1083
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,319
lunch or whatever they're doing and

1084
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,200
they're still bloating that's cuz the

1085
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,599
liver has that much more healing to do

1086
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,920
there's that much more toxic nature ins

1087
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,760
inside that liver there's that much more

1088
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,319
viruses bacteria inside that liver

1089
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,240
there's that much more trouble inside

1090
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:54,040
that liver that has to come out and

1091
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,599
toxins and all kinds of stuff and metals

1092
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,000
that's why I like the heavy metal detox

1093
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,680
smoothie

1094
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,319
a medical medium heavy metal detox

1095
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,440
smoothie it's a

1096
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:04,839
lifesaver because metals have to come

1097
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,960
out of the liver pathogens have to come

1098
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:09,119
out all of

1099
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,800
that and then it gets and then it gets

1100
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,000
pushed out and it takes time it takes

1101
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,680
time for the bile reserves to rebuild

1102
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,240
some people's bile is weak from the

1103
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,240
beginning in childhood it can't be fixed

1104
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,599
with a glass of celery juice but you got

1105
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,000
to stay on it and work with it and get

1106
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,400
it better you'll notice the bloating

1107
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,720
getting better over time and it gets

1108
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,319
better and better and better stronger

1109
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,000
and then the liver wants to repair other

1110
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,520
things sometimes it doesn't fix the bile

1111
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,560
problem yet because you're actually

1112
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,119
helping it to stop greater and bigger

1113
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,880
problems that were occurring that you

1114
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,119
didn't even know that could lead to

1115
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:45,119
disease down the road when you're 60 70

1116
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,680
50 40 whatever it is and your liver is

1117
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,200
working on things by taking the

1118
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,640
nutrients and taking the foods and

1119
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,960
taking the advantage of having you do

1120
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:54,319
low protein and low fats by taking the

1121
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,359
advantage of doing that and then re

1122
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,760
reestablishing itself healing itself

1123
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,119
rebuilding areas of it that it produces

1124
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,960
hormones areas that it produces enzymes

1125
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,720
areas that it produces Miracle chemical

1126
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,440
functions that keep you alive to protect

1127
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,000
your heart to protect your brain all

1128
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,760
these things it does that's also

1129
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,920
weakening that bile is the last thing

1130
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,640
it's got to worry about sometimes so let

1131
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,680
it be rancid fats going down your gut

1132
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,280
lining Let It Be rancid proteins going

1133
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,400
down your gut lining because the liver

1134
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,599
is more important fish to fry sometimes

1135
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,319
so it's got to protect you if you're

1136
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,640
really that bad with your liver over the

1137
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,000
years and you don't need liver enzyme

1138
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,960
tests that the doctor's office tell you

1139
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,560
you got a problem believe me because

1140
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,640
those things that's not even I got a

1141
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,599
whole chapter on that in in Li rescue

1142
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,319
right here and there's listen I can't

1143
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:40,040
cover this book in these radio shows I

1144
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,880
could only cover a little bit so if if

1145
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,319
you're even a fraction interested in

1146
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,160
what I have to say no matter what just

1147
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:47,680
get the books and and really crack into

1148
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,319
them just crack into them a chapter at a

1149
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,680
time before bed just a chapter at a time

1150
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:55,319
before bed you'll get nooks and crannies

1151
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,880
and gems and jewels and you get things

1152
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:59,520
that are really tasty and they'll help

1153
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,760
you they'll help you there's some tasty

1154
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,680
pieces in here you just got to look for

1155
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,720
them you got to look for them they're

1156
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,040
all in there here's the deal here's the

1157
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,240
deal let's talk about a couple of things

1158
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,760
people do nutritional yeast disastrous

1159
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,400
disastrous there's glutamic acid in all

1160
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,839
nutritional yeast absolutely

1161
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,559
disastrous and that's hard on the liver

1162
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,079
I'm just being straight up so you'll get

1163
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:24,480
these people and they'll be like you

1164
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,760
know they'll be on social media whatever

1165
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,200
and they're doing all this stuff they're

1166
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,800
like why isn't the medical medium

1167
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,079
protocol helping me uh well first of all

1168
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:34,200
there is no real medical medium protocol

1169
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,960
per se there's just the information

1170
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,760
that's Timeless in the books for every

1171
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,400
single Walk of Life depending on where

1172
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,920
they are meaning wherever they're at

1173
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,880
meeting them at in their health and

1174
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,800
their Health crisis on every level

1175
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,359
there's something in EV in these books

1176
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,680
for everyone to heal with and heal from

1177
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:54,000
with and move forward with because not

1178
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,839
one size fits all that's what the

1179
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
medical medium protocol is

1180
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,880
not one size fits all and then you'll

1181
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,559
hear this person say oh well you know

1182
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,359
meanwhile thousands of people I mean are

1183
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,319
they're they're walking now they get

1184
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:07,880
their anxiety gone they're healing their

1185
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,480
guts their gut is better they got the

1186
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,240
rid of their Lyme disease all these

1187
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,760
amazing things and then you get somebody

1188
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,200
they're eating nutritional yeast and lot

1189
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,720
of nutritional yeast they gobbling it

1190
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,800
down they have to have nutritional yeast

1191
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,960
every single day with all that glutamic

1192
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,200
acid totally saturating the liver and

1193
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,160
they're wondering why their bloating is

1194
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,960
not going

1195
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,480
away and then you have and then you have

1196
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,440
somebody who's doing the apple cider

1197
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,599
vinegar the apple cider vinegar will

1198
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,880
make you get bloated vinegar is it

1199
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,760
pickles the liver it's the worst thing

1200
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,079
ever yeah I know apple cider vinegar is

1201
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,680
better than all the other vinegars I'm

1202
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:42,520
not doubting that it's actually good for

1203
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,280
your scalp too it's good for other it's

1204
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,920
good for your skin to treat your skin

1205
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,359
terrible for your liver internally when

1206
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,920
you consume it but that'll that'll

1207
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,480
weaken your liver weaken your bile

1208
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,160
weaken your hydrochloric acid destroy

1209
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,680
your hydrochloric

1210
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,359
acid that acidic nature vinegar destroys

1211
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,480
hydrochloric acid hydrochloric acid in

1212
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,160
your stomach can only rebuild through

1213
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,760
mineral salts that are

1214
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,720
alkaline in nature both on the back and

1215
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,040
on the front that means even if apple

1216
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,800
cider vinegar has an alkalinizing kind

1217
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,839
of effect in some way internally what it

1218
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,480
is it's completely acidic in its worst

1219
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:25,000
way and mineral salts are not they're

1220
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,319
never acidic in any way back or front of

1221
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,839
it on a on a on on an Alchemy level you

1222
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,559
know the bottom line is you just hurt

1223
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,280
your liver and you get you get

1224
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,200
bloated so what's behind bloating like

1225
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm saying what's the other things when

1226
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,000
the bloating occurs it starts to happen

1227
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,079
part of bloating is the gut coping with

1228
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,280
poorly digested food another part is

1229
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:51,839
when the liver is unhappy and stagnant

1230
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,760
to the point of lower bioproduction

1231
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,680
right yeah it means that it's also

1232
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,400
overburdened with toxic materials like I

1233
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:02,000
was saying leeching out into the bile so

1234
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:06,880
they end up back in your intestinal

1235
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,880
tract how do you like them apples you

1236
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,520
guys the bile gets filled with metals

1237
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,440
and everything else from the inside of

1238
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,680
the intestinal track drives right up

1239
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,040
into the gut drops into your gut again

1240
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,839
gets

1241
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,640
reabsorbed really a difficult

1242
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:27,240
situation it is there's so much

1243
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,960
there and means that it's overburdened

1244
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,559
with toxic materials and as they leech

1245
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,440
on out into the bile they end up back in

1246
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,599
the intestinal tract they're being

1247
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,079
excreted from the bottom of the liver

1248
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:43,520
off so floating down saturating

1249
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:46,359
lymphatic vessels around the colon and

1250
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,400
absorbing it into the

1251
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:52,640
colon bacterian viruses waste matter old

1252
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,040
viral casings from Epstein bar and

1253
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,000
sticky jelly like sludge produced by

1254
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,839
toxins combined with

1255
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,599
pathogens that's among the materials

1256
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:07,240
that can bleed into the intestinal

1257
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,839
tract oxidative runoff everything all of

1258
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,839
these things coat the lining of the

1259
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,520
small intestinal tract and

1260
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:15,200
colon causing more bloating and it

1261
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,599
hampers everything it hampers good

1262
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:22,040
bacteria that we need it feeds bad

1263
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:24,720
bacteria it feeds unproductive

1264
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,800
microorganisms ultimately I swear it can

1265
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,200
get to the point where the overgrowth of

1266
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,040
strep which causes sibo which is in the

1267
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,599
subtitle of the book Liver Rescue to

1268
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,800
develop strep flourishes and pockets of

1269
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:41,599
the intestinal

1270
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,359
tract it just creates gas more bloating

1271
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,040
more intestinal problems almost

1272
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,559
everybody has

1273
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:52,920
sibo that's the irony they don't need to

1274
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,119
get a diagnosis of it lower lower bio

1275
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,720
and lower hydrochloric acid production

1276
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:02,200
undigested food debris all of this fats

1277
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,800
and proteins undigested and constantly

1278
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,440
being thrown inside the B the bowels

1279
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,400
every day with their

1280
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,760
diet ultimately feeds the pathogens

1281
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,040
whether you're vegan vegetarian or

1282
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,920
animal-based

1283
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,720
diets someone said hey you're just

1284
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,359
you're just you're all about the vegans

1285
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:24,920
you you're all what do you mean I am

1286
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:26,200
since when and you're you're all about

1287
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,359
the and someone said you're all about

1288
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,800
the meat eaters the plant-based PE I

1289
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:32,319
mean the the the Paleo people you're all

1290
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,040
into that right you're you're against

1291
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:38,520
veganism I am what do you mean I've seen

1292
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,599
I've seen plant-based diets save people

1293
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,040
from

1294
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:45,200
Death I've offered plant-based diets

1295
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,319
that have saved people from dying it's

1296
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,040
one of the most powerful ways to heal I

1297
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:51,480
don't care what anybody says you better

1298
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,200
believe

1299
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,520
it and I've seen paleo diets and high

1300
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,079
protein diets PE keep people people from

1301
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:01,559
eating too

1302
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,440
stupid keeps them from eating like crazy

1303
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,680
pizza every day keeps them from eating

1304
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,640
whatever it keeps them from eating you

1305
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,800
know gluten every day and whatnot and

1306
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,400
and it it keeps them balanced in certain

1307
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,920
ways they see to keep people balanced so

1308
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,359
they actually have a rhythm because they

1309
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,680
just love animal protein so you can't

1310
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,640
take animal protein away you never be

1311
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,160
able to take it away so you want to

1312
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,720
support it of course and if they eat it

1313
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,160
in a certain way if you guys like animal

1314
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,960
protein there's a way of eating it and

1315
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,720
still recover and there's also a way of

1316
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:28,040
eating it and still get all those other

1317
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:32,240
things you

1318
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,800
need yeah I've seen it help keeps people

1319
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,680
off of processed foods it keeps people

1320
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,319
from eating worse things but yet sure

1321
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,760
all the high protein diets are still bad

1322
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:41,119
you just got to lower lower the fats and

1323
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,079
lower the proteins and you could still

1324
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,359
have some animal products all the vegans

1325
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,839
you got to lower the nuts and seeds

1326
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:48,280
lower the coconut oils lower all the

1327
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,240
almond butter lower all the the avocado

1328
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,760
and the other oils and and seeds and

1329
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,119
everything you got to lower those down

1330
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,000
too it's not that I'm against anything

1331
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,799
or paleo or vegan it's it's just you

1332
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,400
know what I'm against I'm against

1333
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:04,000
killing your liver with fats no matter

1334
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,160
what aisle you sit on how about

1335
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,880
that you got to watch out for ammonia

1336
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,079
permeability that's something that I

1337
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,119
brought to the world ammonia

1338
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,520
permeability doesn't exist that science

1339
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,280
research does even know about it Le it's

1340
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,680
not leaky gut it's ammonia permeability

1341
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,880
rotting rotting food leaking out an

1342
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,319
ammonia gas that actually doesn't cause

1343
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,319
leaky gut but it travels everywhere

1344
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,640
through the body it's

1345
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:28,920
ghostlike don't confuse that with leaky

1346
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,319
gut that's just old old

1347
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,440
news old

1348
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,440
misinformation so it's important to know

1349
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,640
all these different

1350
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,920
things so the bottom line is bloating

1351
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,599
cramping discomfort distension all Rises

1352
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:47,680
up from the gut into your stomach

1353
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:50,160
contributing to further further

1354
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,319
diminishment of hydrochloric acid and

1355
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,000
reserves stomach GLS

1356
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,040
weaken

1357
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,760
everything bacteria like H pylori

1358
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,079
proliferate in the environment strappy

1359
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,599
coli ulcers can happen

1360
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:08,680
staff all of it can prosper even candida

1361
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,359
even though candida isn't a problem

1362
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,079
there's other fungus that is a problem

1363
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:15,760
though there's bad fungus that people

1364
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,119
get so the bottom line is undigested

1365
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,720
protein doesn't break down right

1366
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,280
undigested fat doesn't break down

1367
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,000
dangerous funguses viruses everything

1368
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,480
can sit inside the gut and produce

1369
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,359
poison

1370
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,000
and sit inside the liver producing

1371
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,200
poison so you keep on

1372
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,960
bloating and if you haven't bloated yet

1373
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,640
in your

1374
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,160
life protect yourself now get your diet

because you're going to bloat down the

1380
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,240
road because inevitably you're going to
