[62.12 - 67.24] you're changing the world with me that
[64.08 - 70.20] we're doing it it it you know it it was
[67.24 - 73.20] so hard it started out in childhood with
[70.20 - 76.64] Spirit saying to me look we have to get
[73.20 - 78.80] ahead somehow of the misinformation
[76.64 - 81.56] that's out there in any way we can we
[78.80 - 84.48] have to help people and and hearing that
[81.56 - 87.12] when I was young it just it was too much
[84.48 - 89.92] it was just way too much what is he
[87.12 - 93.12] talking about what is spirit talk
[89.92 - 95.72] talking about and it was really hard to
[93.12 - 97.48] really kind of bite into that and then
[95.72 - 98.96] you know as the years went on I said
[97.48 - 101.60] okay it's time to do this it's time to
[98.96 - 103.20] do this now we have to really do this
[101.60 - 106.60] because there's so much misinformation
[103.20 - 109.48] out there it's flooded like never before
[106.60 - 111.52] and I remember even 10 years ago 10
[109.48 - 113.12] years ago there was there first of all
[111.52 - 115.64] there was barely any information out
[113.12 - 118.68] there number one I mean I was giving
[115.64 - 121.92] information just as advanced now um to
[118.68 - 125.28] my to my clients all the time and other
[121.92 - 126.68] doctors at that time but there wasn't
[125.28 - 129.32] really you know it was still kind of
[126.68 - 132.80] early 10 15 years ago still kind of
[129.32 - 133.68] early in the making of of of what was
[132.80 - 135.92] happening out there with the
[133.68 - 137.84] misinformation all you know flying
[135.92 - 140.08] around the internet it wasn't so
[137.84 - 142.32] saturated there weren't so many
[140.08 - 145.72] different belief
[142.32 - 146.72] systems saturated in in the system out
[145.72 - 148.88] there of
[146.72 - 150.48] misinformation so there was lack of
[148.88 - 152.40] information there was a lack of
[150.48 - 154.00] information and this was really hard
[152.40 - 155.68] really hard especially for hard for
[154.00 - 158.20] younger people that were sick with
[155.68 - 159.80] chronic illness oh my God and you may be
[158.20 - 162.04] one of them you may have been one of
[159.80 - 163.92] them and you may be one of them now a
[162.04 - 168.20] younger person now dealing with symptoms
[163.92 - 171.04] and things like that now and you know
[168.20 - 173.52] and and it it's it's difficult well back
[171.04 - 177.00] 10 15 years ago there was just nothing
[173.52 - 179.12] there there was nothing there and uh you
[177.00 - 182.32] go a little bit further really nothing
[179.12 - 185.20] there oh my God and so I was able to
[182.32 - 187.24] deliver this information just as just as
[185.20 - 189.28] up to dat and Advance as it is decades
[187.24 - 192.20] ahead of what's out there even now was
[189.28 - 196.36] able to deliver that to people back then
[192.20 - 198.28] going all the way back but there wasn't
[196.36 - 200.08] there wasn't that flood of
[198.28 - 204.56] misinformation that was out there to a
[200.08 - 205.80] degree now oh my God and and so that's
[204.56 - 207.76] why it's so important that you're
[205.80 - 210.92] becoming an expert look the thyroid
[207.76 - 212.24] healing book when you actually get into
[210.92 - 214.24] this book the
[212.24 - 216.12] information is is
[214.24 - 218.28] mind-blowing and you'll become that
[216.12 - 220.80] expert in in the thyroid world in the in
[218.28 - 222.84] the thyroid help in the thyroid health
[220.80 - 224.32] and you'll be able to help anybody and
[222.84 - 226.20] if you don't want to help anybody it's
[224.32 - 227.44] okay you just you work on yourself but
[226.20 - 228.64] what's going to happen is somebody's
[227.44 - 229.96] going to you know you're going to bump
[228.64 - 232.12] into somebody and they're going to be
[229.96 - 233.88] like whether it's an aunt an uncle
[232.12 - 234.96] whether it's an old friend what whatever
[233.88 - 236.12] it is and they're going to be like yeah
[234.96 - 240.16] I got this thyroid problem and you're
[236.12 - 243.12] going to know so much so much and it's a
[240.16 - 246.48] big deal it's a really big deal so it's
[243.12 - 248.60] an honor to just have you here and you
[246.48 - 250.36] know back like I said back 10 years ago
[248.60 - 252.84] and a little further when you were when
[250.36 - 256.32] you were younger when mean meaning when
[252.84 - 257.80] someone was young at that time and had a
[256.32 - 259.92] problem whether they had a condition
[257.80 - 261.88] coming on mystery symptoms you name it
[259.92 - 264.40] they're going to doctors and there was
[261.88 - 266.72] just nothing on the internet and what
[264.40 - 269.68] was out there you know I mean wasn't
[266.72 - 273.00] that great so that was difficult and
[269.68 - 275.08] then of course if you're if if you know
[273.00 - 277.68] 10 years ago if if you weren't a young
[275.08 - 280.24] person and you were you know you were
[277.68 - 283.84] whatever a little bit old or whatever
[280.24 - 286.60] and then we sick chronically back 20 30
[283.84 - 290.04] years ago oh my God you know it's it was
[286.60 - 294.00] so difficult people ha have been through
[290.04 - 296.40] so much with their journey in healing
[294.00 - 297.92] and now today they they have challenges
[296.40 - 299.92] that are a little bit different
[297.92 - 301.48] challenges of so many different things
[299.92 - 303.48] to choose from so much different
[301.48 - 307.84] information to choose from where to go
[303.48 - 310.68] what to do how to do it and and that's
[307.84 - 313.12] why I you know I've always always say
[310.68 - 317.04] that's why I say in in front of my radio
[313.12 - 320.48] shows too now that this is the only
[317.04 - 322.24] place and and I know that's pushing it
[320.48 - 324.68] right the way I'm saying it I know it
[322.24 - 326.36] but it's I promise you it's true this is
[324.68 - 328.76] the only place where the information is
[326.36 - 330.16] not tampered with and it's not
[328.76 - 332.28] manipulated
[330.16 - 334.84] by any kind of interest group but along
[332.28 - 336.40] the way if other information was or you
[334.84 - 338.44] know medical funding with the strings
[336.40 - 341.12] attached and the the botched up research
[338.44 - 343.24] the thumb on the scale research you know
[341.12 - 345.36] the lobbyist that no one knows about in
[343.24 - 346.68] alternative medicine I mean oh my God
[345.36 - 349.28] there's lobbyists in alternative
[346.68 - 350.72] medicine nobody knows this I mean nobody
[349.28 - 353.36] talks about it it's
[350.72 - 354.80] unreal and the internal Kickbacks the
[353.36 - 357.08] persuaded belief systems both
[354.80 - 359.48] conventional and alternative and the
[357.08 - 361.80] private panels of people the private pan
[359.48 - 363.80] panels of people that make decisions for
[361.80 - 365.08] you that have don't even have health
[363.80 - 368.52] problems so they don't even know what
[365.08 - 372.12] you went through and the health field
[368.52 - 375.84] payoffs and the trendy traps that are
[372.12 - 377.68] online and so yeah and and of course in
[375.84 - 379.28] other books so I say that this is the
[377.68 - 381.16] only place that doesn't have that no
[379.28 - 382.80] this information's pure it's untampered
[381.16 - 387.04] with it's clean it comes from the source
[382.80 - 389.16] I was born to hear and that Source makes
[387.04 - 392.56] you the expert that Source makes you the
[389.16 - 395.40] expert ERT it takes you to that next
[392.56 - 398.36] level that level you know you just we
[395.40 - 400.44] can't find any other place right now
[398.36 - 403.40] when it comes down to chronic illness
[400.44 - 405.12] when it comes down to chronic illness so
[403.40 - 408.12] and that's most important because
[405.12 - 409.84] chronic illness leads to so many things
[408.12 - 411.40] it leads to all kinds of trouble and
[409.84 - 414.76] problems and everything else chronic
[411.40 - 417.92] illness that's where we're in trouble
[414.76 - 419.40] here meaning in the industries and we
[417.92 - 420.80] have to we have to do something about
[419.40 - 422.04] about it and that's what these books are
[420.80 - 423.68] that's what the thyroid healing book is
[422.04 - 425.28] so thank you for being here at this
[423.68 - 428.08] webinar we're talking about the secrets
[425.28 - 430.64] of gut health the secrets of gut health
[428.08 - 433.84] and I want to I want to kind of tie it
[430.64 - 437.40] into the thyroid a little bit because
[433.84 - 439.60] everything right now is getting blamed
[437.40 - 442.12] on the thyroid too so the thyroid
[439.60 - 444.68] Experts of the day are trying to push
[442.12 - 448.28] everything into the thyroid every
[444.68 - 449.96] symptom into into it being the thyroid I
[448.28 - 451.64] don't know if you're experiencing that
[449.96 - 453.96] yet I don't know if that's something
[451.64 - 457.68] that you know you you've come across or
[453.96 - 459.52] you've experienced yet but that's what's
[457.68 - 461.44] happening so it's all getting pointed to
[459.52 - 463.24] the thyroid if it's not getting pointed
[461.44 - 466.32] to Lyme disease it gets pointed to the
[463.24 - 468.20] thyroid now that's what's happening so
[466.32 - 471.96] you know any kind of aches and pains
[468.20 - 474.52] fatigue um you know brain fog confusion
[471.96 - 475.72] uh no sex drive um all these different
[474.52 - 478.00] things you know that you have loss of
[475.72 - 479.32] libido whatever all that it's getting
[478.00 - 482.20] it's getting thrown into the thigh
[479.32 - 484.08] thyroid package now that's where all
[482.20 - 486.56] that's going weight gain everything else
[484.08 - 489.40] gets thrown into the the thyroid
[486.56 - 492.04] package and maybe you're not up maybe
[489.40 - 493.96] you haven't gotten to that point yet
[492.04 - 497.28] maybe you haven't maybe you're just a
[493.96 - 498.88] curious thyroid information Seeker
[497.28 - 502.08] you've been told you might have a
[498.88 - 504.24] thyroid problem you haven't really been
[502.08 - 505.68] through too much you're not diagnosed
[504.24 - 507.28] with Hashimoto or maybe you've been
[505.68 - 510.48] diagnosed with
[507.28 - 512.60] Hashimoto and you know you're not really
[510.48 - 514.32] you're not really being thrown into that
[512.60 - 516.28] whole new package that's coming out
[514.32 - 517.92] lately that's trying to be like hey this
[516.28 - 520.16] is ahead of the curve this this big
[517.92 - 521.92] package of misinformation where there's
[520.16 - 523.28] a whole bunch of experts now on thyroid
[521.92 - 525.96] claiming that all these symptoms are
[523.28 - 527.40] your thyroid and and how glorious is it
[525.96 - 529.72] that we have this big
[527.40 - 531.32] answer and so it's making the thyroid
[529.72 - 533.44] Experts of today look like they're
[531.32 - 536.96] they're they they know what's going on
[533.44 - 541.36] but that's not how it works all these
[536.96 - 542.76] symptoms are not thyroid related are not
[541.36 - 545.52] thyroid
[542.76 - 548.00] related and they're even
[545.52 - 550.52] throwing um gut health issues many
[548.00 - 553.76] different gut health issues
[550.52 - 556.28] into into thyroid
[553.76 - 558.20] relation now we're going to break this
[556.28 - 562.32] apart we're going to talk about what's
[558.20 - 564.48] going on thyroid problems thyroid
[562.32 - 567.28] problems and I have I have over a 100
[564.48 - 569.96] symptoms and conditions in thyroid
[567.28 - 572.16] healing that explain to what's going on
[569.96 - 574.32] to what degree if it's thyroid related
[572.16 - 578.04] or not thyroid
[574.32 - 580.80] related and there's um there's there's
[578.04 - 582.24] undiscovered hormones within the thyroid
[580.80 - 584.32] that are not even discovered by research
[582.24 - 586.44] and science yet in what these hormones
[584.32 - 589.44] do and what your the capabilities of
[586.44 - 591.04] what your thyroid does that research
[589.44 - 593.32] research and science hasn't even touched
[591.04 - 594.88] upon what the thyroid can do for you and
[593.32 - 598.20] what is doing for you even when it's
[594.88 - 600.40] hypo even when it's partially removed or
[598.20 - 602.56] removed you wouldn't
[600.40 - 604.44] believe what it can
[602.56 - 608.52] do
[604.44 - 611.44] so basically though so the hip thing the
[608.52 - 614.24] hip trendy new thing is you package it
[611.44 - 617.04] all into thyroid so you know you go to
[614.24 - 618.96] your doctor just gaining some weight and
[617.04 - 621.32] I got some bloating let's just it's
[618.96 - 623.24] probably your thyroid now oh let's see
[621.32 - 625.72] oh yeah the thyroid numbers are off or
[623.24 - 627.36] the thyroid numbers are fine but I still
[625.72 - 629.24] suspect you have a hidden thyroid
[627.36 - 631.96] problem so we're going to start
[629.24 - 633.64] addressing that no matter what well per
[631.96 - 636.56] menopause menopause oh no it's your

[765.56 - 770.44] nice and tucked in or relaxed or however
[769.12 - 772.40] and uh if you're taking notes you're
[770.44 - 776.88] taking notes or whatever you need to
[772.40 - 778.84] do um so let's talk about this a little
[776.88 - 781.16] bit constipation getting thrown into the
[778.84 - 782.68] the whole thyroid the whole thyroid
[781.16 - 785.80] package
[782.68 - 789.24] lately um well if your thyroids
[785.80 - 791.60] not not uh up to par if it's not
[789.24 - 793.12] producing what it needs to produce if
[791.60 - 795.52] it's not producing the hormone it needs
[793.12 - 798.04] to produce if there's anything going on
[795.52 - 799.76] with the thyroid whatsoever um if it's
[798.04 - 801.64] inflamed if there's
[799.76 - 803.96] Hashimoto but you also have other
[801.64 - 805.80] symptoms involved and that's why
[803.96 - 808.24] everything's getting packaged into the
[805.80 - 810.60] thyroid so it's like one of these things
[808.24 - 813.68] where you know a doctor an expert or
[810.60 - 817.36] somebody will be like well um there's
[813.68 - 820.12] constipation too so that it's got to be
[817.36 - 822.12] the thyroid so the the thyroid hormones
[820.12 - 824.36] are lacking so the constipation is going
[822.12 - 828.40] to be happening so that's something
[824.36 - 831.80] that's occurring right now in the in the
[828.40 - 835.52] new world of medicine that we we live in
[831.80 - 837.84] today but they don't have much to do
[835.52 - 840.60] with each other they don't have much to
[837.84 - 842.72] do with each other at all all
[840.60 - 845.56] constipation you know that's that's
[842.72 - 847.52] mostly with other things happening like
[845.56 - 849.96] inflammation occurring in the small
[847.52 - 850.92] intestinal tract inflammation occurring
[849.96 - 855.80] in the
[850.92 - 859.60] colon that's more to do with
[855.80 - 861.08] constipation um less peristaltic action
[859.60 - 864.52] due to
[861.08 - 867.00] inflammation um the nervous system
[864.52 - 868.92] certain nerves going all to the colon or
[867.00 - 871.28] the small intestinal tract that that
[868.92 - 873.56] allow for creating that peristaltic
[871.28 - 875.60] action maybe not be getting the right
[873.56 - 876.96] signal through those nerves the person
[875.60 - 878.36] may not be getting the right signals
[876.96 - 880.60] going through those nerves going to the
[878.36 - 884.56] colon going to the small intestinal
[880.60 - 887.48] tract to give it that twist it
[884.56 - 890.36] needs a liver
[887.48 - 892.56] issue big one for constipation sluggish
[890.36 - 893.56] liver stagnant liver that's a big one
[892.56 - 895.68] for
[893.56 - 899.68] constipation very big
[895.68 - 901.52] one okay so these are more what we're
[899.68 - 903.52] talking about why would the intestinal
[901.52 - 906.32] tract or colon be
[903.52 - 908.28] inflamed could be a viral issue going on
[906.32 - 910.76] inside the liver a little bit of old
[908.28 - 912.68] Epstein bar maybe some other kind of
[910.76 - 915.44] virus in the liver going
[912.68 - 918.28] on and maybe a little bit of strep a
[915.44 - 920.24] cacus a little bit of strep chronic
[918.28 - 922.20] that's always in the intestinal tract
[920.24 - 924.88] small intestinal tract or large
[922.20 - 927.52] intestinal track causing some
[924.88 - 930.52] inflammation little bit pockets of ecoli
[927.52 - 932.48] causing some inflammation as well um
[930.52 - 934.48] toxins coming from a sluggish
[932.48 - 936.40] liver and there's a lot of different
[934.48 - 939.36] toxins that sit inside a
[936.40 - 941.24] liver and those toxins can get into the
[939.36 - 943.68] colon and into the intestinal tract
[941.24 - 946.48] let's cover some of those toxins toxins
[943.68 - 948.80] from medications such as thyroid
[946.48 - 951.60] medication yeah the thyroid medication
[948.80 - 952.48] is is a funny thing because it builds up
[951.60 - 955.52] in the
[952.48 - 957.00] liver so it just builds up it builds up
[955.52 - 958.92] it builds up it builds up the liver has
[957.00 - 961.68] to absorb it like a sponge Non-Stop for
[958.92 - 963.24] years and years and years then it has to
[961.68 - 965.48] figure out a way to get that thyroid
[963.24 - 967.12] medication out liver gets nice and
[965.48 - 969.12] sluggish it can't function anymore
[967.12 - 970.60] thyroid medication has to get out
[969.12 - 972.80] somehow it finds its way inside the
[970.60 - 976.80] colon over
[972.80 - 979.92] time and sits in the lining of the colon
[976.80 - 981.92] doesn't leave so fast medications
[979.92 - 983.12] they're not quick to leave the body
[981.92 - 984.48] they're not one of these things that
[983.12 - 985.64] they're just so quick to leave the body
[984.48 - 987.40] that's not how medications work
[985.64 - 990.16] especially thyroid medication is not a
[987.40 - 994.56] medication actually leaves the body so
[990.16 - 998.08] quickly toxic heavy metals lead chromium
[994.56 - 999.64] nickel so lead chromium nickel Mercury
[998.08 - 1002.64] aluminum
[999.64 - 1004.60] copper uh arsenic the list goes on heavy
[1002.64 - 1008.48] toxic heavy metals inside the
[1004.60 - 1010.12] liver viruses Epstein bar hhv6 shingles
[1008.48 - 1013.84] cyega
[1010.12 - 1017.00] virus viral toxins that creates so many
[1013.84 - 1019.92] symptoms that we talk about in thyroid
[1017.00 - 1021.76] healing when I say we it's spirit I talk
[1019.92 - 1024.60] about in thyroid
[1021.76 - 1026.44] healing so all all the different
[1024.60 - 1027.96] symptoms that we get for chronic
[1026.44 - 1029.44] illnesses like chronic fatigue syndrome
[1027.96 - 1032.24] all the tingles and numbs all this
[1029.44 - 1036.12] different stuff there's neurotoxins
[1032.24 - 1038.92] related and but like I said you know
[1036.12 - 1040.92] these illnesses these symptoms get
[1038.92 - 1042.76] totally thrown into the thyroid basket
[1040.92 - 1044.20] now that's what the experts do cuz
[1042.76 - 1047.84] experts don't
[1044.20 - 1049.56] know you know the the recent information
[1047.84 - 1050.76] it's out there internet or books or
[1049.56 - 1054.00] whatever they just don't know where
[1050.76 - 1055.48] these symptoms come from so hey they're
[1054.00 - 1058.56] Heroes it comes from the thyroid now
[1055.48 - 1061.08] that's the new thing so now the heroes
[1058.56 - 1064.20] it's not coming from the thyroid it's
[1061.08 - 1066.92] not the thyroid is just one more symptom
[1064.20 - 1069.60] with everything else it's one more
[1066.92 - 1071.92] symptom with everything else that's the
[1069.60 - 1074.12] big secret that's the big
[1071.92 - 1075.88] truth the thyroid is just one more
[1074.12 - 1077.72] symptom the thyroid does have problems
[1075.88 - 1079.16] it does get injured it does get involved
[1077.72 - 1080.44] we're going to go into into that a
[1079.16 - 1082.00] little bit today but we're going to do
[1080.44 - 1085.00] that even more in the next webinar it's
[1082.00 - 1086.52] going to be focused mainly on thyroid
[1085.00 - 1090.24] this is about the
[1086.52 - 1092.88] gut but so what happens is everything is
[1090.24 - 1095.20] just thrown into the thyroid
[1092.88 - 1096.84] basket so you can have the neurotoxins
[1095.20 - 1099.36] inside the liver the dermato toxins
[1096.84 - 1102.08] inside the liver viral casing so that's
[1099.36 - 1104.56] dead bodies of viruses and bacteria and
[1102.08 - 1107.32] all kinds of great stuff pesticides
[1104.56 - 1108.84] herbicides fungicides rodenticides
[1107.32 - 1110.88] insecticides
[1108.84 - 1112.80] they all sit inside the
[1110.88 - 1118.36] liver
[1112.80 - 1120.20] radiation sits in liver solvents and fat
[1118.36 - 1124.96] fat sit inside the
[1120.20 - 1127.52] liver fats it's old rancid fats culate
[1124.96 - 1129.68] and they just sit inside the
[1127.52 - 1132.36] liver and they weaken the liver make the
[1129.68 - 1134.48] liver sluggish and then we have
[1132.36 - 1136.76] constipation we have
[1134.48 - 1139.56] bloating we
[1136.76 - 1142.16] have sometimes B of
[1139.56 - 1144.00] gastritis we get to a point where we can
[1142.16 - 1147.20] get set up for diverticulitis
[1144.00 - 1150.52] diverticulosis down the
[1147.20 - 1154.32] road our candida levels can rise cuz
[1150.52 - 1155.88] candida is trying to save our butts
[1154.32 - 1157.88] trying to save our
[1155.88 - 1159.24] butts it's a whole another thing we'll
[1157.88 - 1161.68] talk about a little bit I know I talked
[1159.24 - 1165.24] about it before on one of the radio
[1161.68 - 1169.36] shows but try to give you guys even
[1165.24 - 1171.08] additional information if I can so so
[1169.36 - 1172.56] there's all these things that sit inside
[1171.08 - 1175.24] the liver make it sluggish make it
[1172.56 - 1178.80] dysfunctional and the liver plays a role
[1175.24 - 1180.48] more in thyroid symptoms than anything
[1178.80 - 1183.72] else
[1180.48 - 1186.32] almost that's what's unbelievable and
[1183.72 - 1189.76] the liver plays a role in so much of our
[1186.32 - 1192.84] gut health issues it is unbelievable how
[1189.76 - 1195.72] much the liver liver plays a role in our
[1192.84 - 1199.40] gut health issues when the liver
[1195.72 - 1202.68] weakens breaks down it gets sluggish it
[1199.40 - 1204.48] gets stagnant and it can't produce the
[1202.68 - 1208.40] bile need
[1204.48 - 1212.28] it it can't produce the bile the bile
[1208.40 - 1216.24] strength the bile salt strength is
[1212.28 - 1219.16] reduced so when that bile starts popping
[1216.24 - 1221.40] out the
[1219.16 - 1224.48] gallbladder and it starts popping out of
[1221.40 - 1227.64] the gallbladder and it's getting down in
[1224.48 - 1229.68] there and the small the the top of the
[1227.64 - 1230.48] small intes track in the dadum in that
[1229.68 - 1234.00] whole
[1230.48 - 1237.40] area it's weak it's weaker it's weaker
[1234.00 - 1240.40] bile fluid it's
[1237.40 - 1241.64] weaker when it's weaker it can't break
[1240.40 - 1245.32] down
[1241.64 - 1247.24] fat so the fats go rans it to people on
[1245.32 - 1248.56] a high fat diet there be a lot of e like
[1247.24 - 1250.76] eating a lot of chicken which is high
[1248.56 - 1252.88] fat doesn't matter if it's lean breast
[1250.76 - 1254.08] with no skin on it's still high fat it's
[1252.88 - 1255.80] just you know cuz that's the calorie
[1254.08 - 1257.32] inside the chicken if they're eating too
[1255.80 - 1258.72] many nuts somebody who's eating too many
[1257.32 - 1262.00] nuts you got a vegan eating too many
[1258.72 - 1265.52] nuts way too many nuts and nut Butters
[1262.00 - 1268.96] um way too much chocolate or whatever it
[1265.52 - 1271.36] is then you got you get all that fat
[1268.96 - 1274.60] that the B's having a difficulty break
[1271.36 - 1277.28] down someone's eating lots of grass-fed
[1274.60 - 1278.80] beef got all that fat in it doesn't I'm
[1277.28 - 1280.36] not talking about brisket I'm not
[1278.80 - 1282.60] talking about ribs I'm talking about
[1280.36 - 1284.48] just the leanest cut you could find
[1282.60 - 1287.92] still lots of fat in
[1284.48 - 1289.48] there if someone's just you know I don't
[1287.92 - 1291.16] know someone's eating tons of coconut
[1289.48 - 1293.00] oil and lots of avocados too many
[1291.16 - 1295.28] avocados they're eating six eight
[1293.00 - 1296.68] avocados a day people do that and and
[1295.28 - 1298.92] it's a good healthy
[1296.68 - 1301.52] food and look if you're in the animal
[1298.92 - 1304.28] protein yeah lean grass-fed beef is the
[1301.52 - 1306.68] the safest way to go but all these fats
[1304.28 - 1309.12] what they do they're hard to hard to
[1306.68 - 1311.44] break down see I don't I don't I don't
[1309.12 - 1313.88] stick myself to a belief system Spirit
[1311.44 - 1316.80] told me a long time ago if you fall into
[1313.88 - 1318.36] one belief system I'm done with you
[1316.80 - 1319.68] spirit said Spirit was kidding Spirit
[1318.36 - 1320.80] has a sense of humor you have to have a
[1319.68 - 1324.04] sense of
[1320.80 - 1326.32] humor you have to have a spir a sense of
[1324.04 - 1327.48] humor I've actually asked Spirit about
[1326.32 - 1330.72] that along the way I said why do you
[1327.48 - 1332.92] have a sense of humor spirit Spirit said
[1330.72 - 1334.48] that you know that truly tapped in joy
[1332.92 - 1337.28] that truly tapped in compassion that
[1334.48 - 1338.84] truly tra tapped in love that truly that
[1337.28 - 1341.24] true true
[1338.84 - 1343.84] place there's humor there's joy and
[1341.24 - 1346.84] humor with it there's lighthearted
[1343.84 - 1349.76] nature in in in it and spirit said look
[1346.84 - 1352.04] you can't get this Bel system and you
[1349.76 - 1354.64] can't just stay with this one belief
[1352.04 - 1357.80] system and you get stuck in that and
[1354.64 - 1360.40] then you can't help everybody you just
[1357.80 - 1362.72] help some people because part of that
[1360.40 - 1363.72] belief system is good like there's no
[1362.72 - 1366.48] processed
[1363.72 - 1368.84] foods everybody's adopted that at this
[1366.48 - 1370.28] point so then you do help somebody you
[1368.84 - 1371.68] help somebody that's on a fast food diet
[1370.28 - 1373.88] to get off fast food diet to eat a
[1371.68 - 1376.12] certain way doesn't mean it's the right
[1373.88 - 1379.28] way entirely for their conditions so you
[1376.12 - 1381.60] can't fall into a belief system right
[1379.28 - 1382.72] and so I can't do that I'm not allowed
[1381.60 - 1385.40] to do
[1382.72 - 1387.84] that and I wanted to fall into a belief
[1385.40 - 1389.80] system badly just like anybody would or
[1387.84 - 1393.16] any practitioner or any healer whatever
[1389.80 - 1395.80] I wanted to Spirit wouldn't let me kept
[1393.16 - 1397.88] me on my toes to make sure you get the
[1395.80 - 1400.72] right information I wanted to believe
[1397.88 - 1402.12] candida was really bad I wanted that I
[1400.72 - 1405.12] mean that's what I wanted like yeah
[1402.12 - 1407.20] candida no spirit said no you kill all
[1405.12 - 1408.72] your candida you die you can't live
[1407.20 - 1411.84] without Candida
[1408.72 - 1414.12] candida allows absorption of nutrients
[1411.84 - 1416.92] to get into the bloodstream to allows no
[1414.12 - 1419.04] that's that's the osmosis machine that
[1416.92 - 1421.92] candida is your
[1419.04 - 1423.32] lifeline we're not told that candida
[1421.92 - 1425.92] gets out of control it grows because
[1423.32 - 1427.84] you're dumping so much because okay okay
[1425.92 - 1432.60] this is a good point right here that I
[1427.84 - 1434.92] got to connect is the bile salts get so
[1432.60 - 1436.88] weak from the liver from the liver
[1434.92 - 1440.64] breaking down with all this
[1436.88 - 1442.80] garbage that the bile salts weaken can't
[1440.64 - 1444.48] break down the fats fats get rancid they
[1442.80 - 1446.96] go into the intestinal tract and guess
[1444.48 - 1449.56] what feeds off of it
[1446.96 - 1451.64] bacteria so candida has to step up its
[1449.56 - 1453.16] game it has to say no no no no you can't
[1451.64 - 1455.48] do that I don't want strepa cacus
[1453.16 - 1459.48] feeding off all this and creating sio
[1455.48 - 1461.84] yes I don't want uh stakus feeding off
[1459.48 - 1463.72] of all this rancid fat that can't break
[1461.84 - 1465.76] down enough and rancid protein that
[1463.72 - 1468.92] can't break down
[1465.76 - 1473.04] enough I don't want that being fed to
[1468.92 - 1475.72] strepa coasy koi seiff staff I don't
[1473.04 - 1479.16] want it being fed to Epstein bar to
[1475.72 - 1482.64] shingles variety number
[1479.16 - 1486.00] 21 a non-r rashing one I don't
[1482.64 - 1488.16] want this being fed to all that so
[1486.00 - 1490.08] candid is programmed programmed by
[1488.16 - 1492.92] something above our
[1490.08 - 1496.12] bodies up in the atmosphere up in the
[1492.92 - 1497.52] heavens up up high candida has a message
[1496.12 - 1500.52] being delivered to it all the time it
[1497.52 - 1502.92] has a the will to keep you alive so
[1500.52 - 1504.72] it'll rise up and it'll grow and then
[1502.92 - 1506.00] some somebody's going to say oh you got
[1504.72 - 1506.92] your candid is out of control that's
[1506.00 - 1508.96] your problem we have to kill off your
[1506.92 - 1510.40] candid to no the problem is we have to
[1508.96 - 1512.84] stop
[1510.40 - 1514.36] feeding some of these bad bacteria and
[1512.84 - 1516.20] other things that create sibo and
[1514.36 - 1518.40] everything because candid is trying to
[1516.20 - 1520.60] save the day it's trying to eat all that
[1518.40 - 1522.04] food so it ends up growing more and more
[1520.60 - 1524.32] because it's trying to eat all that bad
[1522.04 - 1526.44] food that's rancid and not breaking down
[1524.32 - 1529.36] so it could save your
[1526.44 - 1530.68] butt so but I wanted a belief system
[1529.36 - 1532.64] when I was younger I'd be like Oh
[1530.68 - 1534.76] Candida spirit said yeah well I want to
[1532.64 - 1536.92] tell you about this fungus like oh
[1534.76 - 1538.76] fungus is bad bad no and spirit's like
[1536.92 - 1541.52] don't fall into a belief so you have to
[1538.76 - 1544.72] understand what this does no matter what
[1541.52 - 1547.48] information lies out there so I can't
[1544.72 - 1550.64] look at information I can't ever I can't
[1547.48 - 1553.08] I can't read books and that I get
[1550.64 - 1555.32] polluted because that information's been
[1553.08 - 1559.24] polluted somewhere or originally
[1555.32 - 1561.08] wherever it came from and so in order to
[1559.24 - 1564.76] keep the stuff pure and clean so it
[1561.08 - 1567.20] comes to you pure and clean untampered
[1564.76 - 1570.96] with so that's how candida works so when
[1567.20 - 1574.24] the liver gets sluggish and breaks
[1570.96 - 1576.60] down and gets weaker it's still your
[1574.24 - 1578.72] hero your liver is still your hero you
[1576.60 - 1581.84] got to love your liver you have to love
[1578.72 - 1584.16] it but it's still your hero that's not
[1581.84 - 1585.64] your thyroid that's not your thyroid
[1584.16 - 1587.80] causing the symptoms that's not your
[1585.64 - 1590.64] thyroid causing the constipation that's
[1587.80 - 1592.20] not your thyroid causing brain fog
[1590.64 - 1594.40] difficulty concentrating those are
[1592.20 - 1597.08] poisons and
[1594.40 - 1598.76] toxins those are poisons and toxins
[1597.08 - 1600.36] coming from other things like for
[1598.76 - 1602.12] instance brain fog that's that's a
[1600.36 - 1604.72] symptom from Epstein bar that's a
[1602.12 - 1606.84] symptoms that's a symptom from
[1604.72 - 1608.84] neurotoxins floating around in the
[1606.84 - 1610.68] bloodstream produced by a virus and the
[1608.84 - 1613.44] liver has a lot of neurotoxins in it
[1610.68 - 1615.76] from a virus like Epstein bar it just so
[1613.44 - 1619.44] happens you may also have a thyroid
[1615.76 - 1623.40] problem too eventually
[1619.44 - 1625.96] and thyroid healing explains why because
[1623.40 - 1629.28] the thyroid becomes a victim another
[1625.96 - 1633.40] victim another Target for something like
[1629.28 - 1636.48] Epstein bar but originally the the brain
[1633.40 - 1638.48] fog is from pollutants from the liver
[1636.48 - 1640.32] weakening from it having something going
[1638.48 - 1643.72] on in it in
[1640.32 - 1645.84] it and the difficulty
[1643.72 - 1647.84] concentrating it's also you know heavy
[1645.84 - 1649.96] metals oxidize and they're in the liver
[1647.84 - 1651.72] they oxidize and they're they can be in
[1649.96 - 1653.44] the brain too and oxidize and then
[1651.72 - 1655.76] viruses such as the epine bar can feed
[1653.44 - 1658.20] off of the heavy metals and create more
[1655.76 - 1660.16] neurotoxins and then more brain fog but
[1658.20 - 1661.48] then you go to the doctor they see also
[1660.16 - 1664.08] something that's low on the numbers of
[1661.48 - 1666.68] the thyroid and then boom you got a
[1664.08 - 1669.32] thyroid diagnosis connecting to that
[1666.68 - 1670.72] symptom and that's that's not Advanced
[1669.32 - 1673.24] enough I got to tell you that's still
[1670.72 - 1675.48] years behind that's still Antiquity
[1673.24 - 1677.88] Antiquity compared to what we're we're
[1675.48 - 1679.32] delivering to you guys I'm on saying
[1677.88 - 1681.04] that because I'm boasting I'm saying
[1679.32 - 1683.96] that because you got to have the right
[1681.04 - 1687.44] info you don't want the wrong
[1683.96 - 1689.64] info I can't tell you how many people
[1687.44 - 1692.88] who met me along the way said if I only
[1689.64 - 1695.80] had this information 20 years
[1692.88 - 1697.80] ago where were you they said to me I
[1695.80 - 1700.52] said oh I was giving this information 20
[1697.80 - 1703.48] years ago I was giving that information
[1700.52 - 1705.76] 25 years ago even more even further I
[1703.48 - 1707.76] was doing it I just didn't meet you you
[1705.76 - 1712.16] had no way of knowing how to get to me
[1707.76 - 1712.16] at that time but it was
[1712.52 - 1716.32] there and when you when you have this
[1714.80 - 1719.24] information you have knowledge you only
[1716.32 - 1720.72] strengthen from it and you only heal
[1719.24 - 1722.48] from
[1720.72 - 1724.48] it
[1722.48 - 1726.52] so
[1724.48 - 1728.84] constipation happens is when all these
[1726.52 - 1730.40] fats they don't break down good enough
[1728.84 - 1732.04] all that protein doesn't break down good
[1730.40 - 1733.28] enough and the protein won't break down
[1732.04 - 1736.40] good enough because your hydrochloric
[1733.28 - 1738.80] acid levels go down they weaken in the
[1736.40 - 1741.64] stomach
[1738.80 - 1744.08] hydrochloric acid weakens in the stomach
[1741.64 - 1747.76] hydrochloric acid weakens in the
[1744.08 - 1750.64] stomach then gastric juices
[1747.76 - 1752.48] weaken gastric juices weaken gastric
[1750.64 - 1757.28] juices weaken we get in trouble then
[1752.48 - 1761.44] protein doesn't break down good and that
[1757.28 - 1764.80] rots in the small intestinal tract feed
[1761.44 - 1767.72] sibo which is strepa cacus sibo is not
[1764.80 - 1772.56] just you if if you haven't heard my CBO
[1767.72 - 1775.16] show sibo isn't just okay that's the
[1772.56 - 1777.24] label that's what it is practitioners
[1775.16 - 1781.08] don't know sibo is
[1777.24 - 1783.96] mostly strep they don't know that strep
[1781.08 - 1787.00] is the dominant bacteria that creates
[1783.96 - 1788.56] sibo that's the one that's the one that
[1787.00 - 1791.32] camps out that's the one that does the
[1788.56 - 1792.84] most that's the that's the sibo
[1791.32 - 1796.60] Creator
[1792.84 - 1799.84] so you got rotting protein going down
[1796.60 - 1802.28] into the small intestinal tract and into
[1799.84 - 1804.80] the into the colon you got rotting
[1802.28 - 1810.00] protein going down in there you got
[1804.80 - 1813.48] rancid putrid fat going down so your B's
[1810.00 - 1813.48] weak it's not breaking down the
[1813.64 - 1819.40] fats your Hydrochloric acid's weak it's
[1817.08 - 1822.40] not breaking down the
[1819.40 - 1824.24] proteins you get a Feeding Frenzy it's
[1822.40 - 1826.40] like being on a boat and throwing a
[1824.24 - 1828.76] whole bunch of chum is that what it is
[1826.40 - 1830.68] Chum
[1828.76 - 1832.24] it's called Chum I think you throw a
[1830.68 - 1837.20] whole bunch of chum in the
[1832.24 - 1839.20] water buckets of it blood guts fish guts
[1837.20 - 1841.20] you know fish heads just throw it in the
[1839.20 - 1844.12] water and then all of a sudden you
[1841.20 - 1846.32] know 20 minutes later you just see a fin
[1844.12 - 1848.56] of a
[1846.32 - 1849.92] shark now that's what it's like you know
[1848.56 - 1851.36] when this stuff drops into the small
[1849.92 - 1853.00] intestinal tract you get this Feeding
[1851.36 - 1855.68] Frenzy and this Feeding Frenzy can go on
[1853.00 - 1857.80] for years before you even get a sio
[1855.68 - 1859.80] diagnosis it but you could be getting
[1857.80 - 1861.36] constipation in between it and and out
[1859.80 - 1863.64] of it you may get constipation just
[1861.36 - 1866.48] later on not even
[1863.64 - 1869.24] yet
[1866.48 - 1871.72] and so as the bacteria is eating the
[1869.24 - 1873.32] food then you been the new thing now
[1871.72 - 1874.92] because I even think practitioners are
[1873.32 - 1876.48] kind of forgetting about candida they
[1874.92 - 1878.08] kind of know that there's holes in that
[1876.48 - 1880.56] one so now they're just everybody's
[1878.08 - 1882.52] getting a sibo
[1880.56 - 1884.00] diagnosis so they're getting sibo
[1882.52 - 1885.80] diagnosis you got a gut problem with
[1884.00 - 1887.64] sibo you got a gut problem with sibo you
[1885.80 - 1890.08] no you got a gut problem with stress
[1887.64 - 1893.08] it's other bugs it's strap but mostly
[1890.08 - 1895.36] strap eating eating and
[1893.08 - 1897.20] eating you can't eat is just trying to
[1895.36 - 1899.08] protect you trying to trying to save you
[1897.20 - 1900.56] but this can cause this can cause
[1899.08 - 1902.20] problems all of it can cause problems
[1900.56 - 1903.92] meaning you get the constipation you
[1902.20 - 1907.68] could get eventually inflamation from
[1903.92 - 1909.32] strep growing outgrowing the
[1907.68 - 1912.40] candida and then you get the
[1909.32 - 1915.88] constipation then you get diagnosed with
[1912.40 - 1915.88] IBS BS of
[1916.16 - 1922.64] constipation bounce of constipation on
[1918.24 - 1924.00] and off bloating gas go to another
[1922.64 - 1925.96] doctor and they're like you got
[1924.00 - 1928.44] irritable bowel syndrome what does that
[1925.96 - 1929.92] mean I don't know maybe you got celiac
[1928.44 - 1933.08] disease what does that mean oh
[1929.92 - 1935.72] autoimmune that's wrong too it's not
[1933.08 - 1938.48] autoimmune that's wrong Celiac isn't
[1935.72 - 1941.16] your body destroying itself that's a
[1938.48 - 1943.32] massive mistake you know there's a
[1941.16 - 1945.64] chapter well no there's a set of
[1943.32 - 1947.92] chapters in thyroid
[1945.64 - 1952.56] healing and
[1947.92 - 1955.64] you know when you when you read this set
[1952.56 - 1959.76] of chapters I think it's
[1955.64 - 1961.36] like I don't know 12 or 13 14 chapters
[1959.76 - 1963.96] on the great mistakes and one of the
[1961.36 - 1966.72] greatest mistakes is autoimmune blaming
[1963.96 - 1969.08] the body for destroying itself
[1966.72 - 1970.36] Celiac is now considered the body
[1969.08 - 1973.16] destroying
[1970.36 - 1975.28] itself body attacking itself body
[1973.16 - 1977.92] attacking the colon body attacking
[1975.28 - 1981.88] organs body attack you know the
[1977.92 - 1984.64] intestinal tract so that's where celiac
[1981.88 - 1985.96] disease headed and that's where down
[1984.64 - 1987.64] that's where it is
[1985.96 - 1992.20] now
[1987.64 - 1993.80] um so it's not the body attacking itself
[1992.20 - 1997.24] it's not at
[1993.80 - 1999.60] all Celiac first of all gluten is a
[1997.24 - 2002.88] trigger the reason why gluten is a
[1999.60 - 2006.32] trigger is it it feeds streps it's one
[2002.88 - 2007.96] of streps favorite foods chronic strep
[2006.32 - 2010.40] where did you getron strip well if you
[2007.96 - 2012.28] have it in your system at your childhood
[2010.40 - 2014.08] and if you've taken any antibiotics in
[2012.28 - 2015.60] your childhood or throughout your life
[2014.08 - 2017.28] those antibiotics just you know
[2015.60 - 2019.56] strengthen the strep up along the way
[2017.28 - 2022.28] that's how it works for all of
[2019.56 - 2025.68] us well that could lead to sibo that can
[2022.28 - 2027.36] lead to just plain old symptoms IBS it
[2025.68 - 2029.24] can lead to
[2027.36 - 2031.88] Celiac and then when you get something
[2029.24 - 2033.60] like Epstein bar in in the system and in
[2031.88 - 2035.32] the liver slowing down the liver and
[2033.60 - 2037.36] doing other things and the Celiac
[2035.32 - 2039.48] symptoms can get worse because the liver
[2037.36 - 2042.16] gets
[2039.48 - 2044.28] worse the liver if the liver's sluggish
[2042.16 - 2047.16] and slow the bile doesn't break down the
[2044.28 - 2049.04] fats if your Hydrochloric acid's low the
[2047.16 - 2051.00] proteins don't break down your Celiac
[2049.04 - 2053.12] can get worse you eat one piece of white
[2051.00 - 2055.20] bread your Celiac flares up because the
[2053.12 - 2056.72] strep is flaring up meaning the strep is
[2055.20 - 2059.28] getting a Feeding Frenzy you have a
[2056.72 - 2062.16] piece of cheese over a neighbor's house
[2059.28 - 2064.88] and then 3 Days Later your Celiac is
[2062.16 - 2067.24] up it's not the body attacking itself
[2064.88 - 2069.92] this is another great mistake great mist
[2067.24 - 2073.68] stake so that's how Celiac works it's a
[2069.92 - 2076.36] little touch about it
[2073.68 - 2077.96] um hydrochloric acid isn't just one
[2076.36 - 2080.36] blend science and research hasn't
[2077.96 - 2082.40] discovered that it's a blend of seven
[2080.36 - 2085.24] and you can have three out of that seven
[2082.40 - 2086.80] below but one out of that seven be high
[2085.24 - 2088.32] and that's all they can do they can get
[2086.80 - 2091.48] a false reading oh you got good enough
[2088.32 - 2093.80] hydrochloric acid because because they
[2091.48 - 2095.04] don't know what they're looking for if
[2093.80 - 2098.08] science and
[2095.04 - 2100.04] research hasn't doesn't know something
[2098.08 - 2102.72] exists they haven't developed a test to
[2100.04 - 2105.44] find it so then it's not on the
[2102.72 - 2107.96] radar that's how it works same thing
[2105.44 - 2109.64] with the two undiscovered hormones
[2107.96 - 2112.00] that's in the thyroid healing book those
[2109.64 - 2113.64] two undiscovered hormones that I brought
[2112.00 - 2115.76] to the table in that book for the first
[2113.64 - 2117.68] time in history I think you're going to
[2115.76 - 2120.20] really appreciate because when you read
[2117.68 - 2122.32] about what these do it's unbelievable
[2120.20 - 2123.76] what they do but science of research
[2122.32 - 2124.72] doesn't know they exist because they
[2123.76 - 2126.20] haven't they don't know what they're
[2124.72 - 2127.52] looking for they have developed a test
[2126.20 - 2129.80] that's not how
[2127.52 - 2131.52] it's not science of research stumbles
[2129.80 - 2133.16] across things they don't know what
[2131.52 - 2134.64] they're ever looking for with anything
[2133.16 - 2136.36] going all the way back that's how this
[2134.64 - 2138.24] is just how it works and I've had
[2136.36 - 2140.16] scientists tell me this tell me that
[2138.24 - 2141.32] they just it's all about stumbling
[2140.16 - 2144.04] across
[2141.32 - 2147.00] things that's how it is it's if you're
[2144.04 - 2149.24] lucky to stumble across
[2147.00 - 2150.60] something that's that's how research and
[2149.24 - 2152.64] science
[2150.60 - 2155.76] works you know
[2152.64 - 2157.68] and and so they haven't stumbled across
[2155.76 - 2158.96] the other two hormones of thyroid has
[2157.68 - 2161.52] they're too comfortable with thinking
[2158.96 - 2164.44] they've already figured it out so
[2161.52 - 2165.88] they're not even going to look in hopes
[2164.44 - 2170.12] to
[2165.88 - 2172.44] stumble so
[2170.12 - 2174.56] um they haven't stumbled across the
[2172.44 - 2177.16] seven blend of the hydrochloric
[2174.56 - 2180.96] acid so that's that's what I'm trying to
[2177.16 - 2184.80] say I don't want to tail off on tail off
[2180.96 - 2187.40] to Never Never Never Land but what
[2184.80 - 2189.04] happens is that with the hydrochloric
[2187.40 - 2190.72] acid if you have a few of the different
[2189.04 - 2193.04] blend that's
[2190.72 - 2194.40] weakened it's not going to do its thing
[2193.04 - 2196.20] it's first of all it's not going to kill
[2194.40 - 2197.68] bugs the way it needs to kill bugs it's
[2196.20 - 2199.72] not going to break down protein the way
[2197.68 - 2202.12] it needs to break down protein so
[2199.72 - 2204.44] protein's rot and they feed strep which
[2202.12 - 2207.40] can get you any kind of diagnosis in the
[2204.44 - 2209.88] end like IBS Celiac I mean it can get
[2207.40 - 2212.20] you any kind overall it can get you a
[2209.88 - 2215.68] Crohn's
[2212.20 - 2218.36] diagnosis it could get you any kind of
[2215.68 - 2221.40] diagnosis and that's how it works
[2218.36 - 2223.00] colitis is a virus in the shingles
[2221.40 - 2225.04] family it's one of the viruses in the
[2223.00 - 2227.72] shingles family there's over 30
[2225.04 - 2229.24] varieties that we brought to the table
[2227.72 - 2230.80] if you heard that somewhere else now
[2229.24 - 2233.12] that's only because it came from me
[2230.80 - 2234.88] originally so you know so you're not
[2233.12 - 2237.52] like oh wait I heard that no no it came
[2234.88 - 2241.76] from here it's important to know
[2237.52 - 2244.76] that so you just so you know hey this is
[2241.76 - 2246.80] how it works with kius colitis is a
[2244.76 - 2249.76] shingles virus that inflames the light
[2246.80 - 2251.48] in the inner Linings of the colon and
[2249.76 - 2254.08] even can move up a little higher than
[2251.48 - 2255.72] that to the small intestinal tract and
[2254.08 - 2258.16] you can get the ruptures you can get you
[2255.72 - 2259.72] know blood vessels can rupture and you
[2258.16 - 2263.00] can also have it mild with there's no
[2259.72 - 2265.24] there really mild mild blood vessel
[2263.00 - 2266.80] rupturing but that's the shingles virus
[2265.24 - 2270.20] causing
[2266.80 - 2272.04] that but well you know that's thrown
[2270.20 - 2273.36] into autoimmune 2 the body attacking
[2272.04 - 2275.84] itself that's not the body attacking
[2273.36 - 2277.24] itself creating colitis and inflammation
[2275.84 - 2281.80] there's a
[2277.24 - 2285.12] pathogen the shingles virus creating
[2281.80 - 2287.56] inflammation Celiac is not inflammation
[2285.12 - 2290.92] created by the body attacking
[2287.56 - 2295.36] itself the body's looking for a pathogen
[2290.92 - 2296.56] the pathogen is INF flaming the lining
[2295.36 - 2299.72] of the
[2296.56 - 2302.00] colon that's how it works so important
[2299.72 - 2305.80] to know so important to
[2302.00 - 2307.16] know I mean you know if if someone I
[2305.80 - 2308.84] mean
[2307.16 - 2310.36] someone had the option you either know
[2308.84 - 2312.80] the truth or you
[2310.36 - 2314.16] don't well actually that's not even a
[2312.80 - 2315.36] good example to use there's people that
[2314.16 - 2317.08] don't want to hear the truth they don't
[2315.36 - 2318.88] want to know the truth there there's
[2317.08 - 2320.76] there's plenty of them so I I mean you
[2318.88 - 2322.20] might even know somebody I mean so
[2320.76 - 2323.60] that's not even a good way of putting it
[2322.20 - 2326.96] all I know is I would want to know the
[2323.60 - 2331.60] right information in my life and I do no
[2326.96 - 2335.36] matter what um okay so so let's go back
[2331.60 - 2337.40] to some of this so leaky gut let's go
[2335.36 - 2339.92] back to leaky gut too
[2337.40 - 2343.28] you know what happens is the liver
[2339.92 - 2345.20] breaks down it's sluggish it's slow
[2343.28 - 2347.84] nothing's working right the BS aren't
[2345.20 - 2349.60] breaking down the fats hydrochloric acid
[2347.84 - 2352.76] the seven blend that's undiscovered
[2349.60 - 2355.12] isn't breaking down the protein properly
[2352.76 - 2357.92] it's going in the gut it's
[2355.12 - 2361.20] rotting and it's in there and what
[2357.92 - 2365.28] creates is ammonia you got ammonia gas
[2361.20 - 2367.28] ammonia gas is not leaky gut leaky gut
[2365.28 - 2369.40] if someone had a leaky gut they'd be in
[2367.28 - 2371.72] the hospital with 105 temperature and
[2369.40 - 2373.96] sep sepsis starting they would actually
[2371.72 - 2376.16] be in the
[2373.96 - 2378.84] hospital what happens is when someone
[2376.16 - 2380.48] gets a colonoscopy and they go and and
[2378.84 - 2382.76] and they get a puncture which happens
[2380.48 - 2384.88] all the time and they get a puncture you
[2382.76 - 2387.96] know the nurse practitioner or whoever
[2384.88 - 2391.24] it is or the doctor um is is or the you
[2387.96 - 2393.28] know is running up the running up the
[2391.24 - 2395.32] camera you know with the wire and
[2393.28 - 2397.84] running up the camera and it all of a
[2395.32 - 2399.04] sudden it gets snagged on a corner and
[2397.84 - 2401.32] it
[2399.04 - 2404.08] punctures as they're kind of driving it
[2401.32 - 2407.08] up there and it happens all the time
[2404.08 - 2411.12] honestly the mild punctures are like one
[2407.08 - 2415.32] out of 10 more severe ones are you know
[2411.12 - 2417.40] probably uh 1 out of 15 one out of 20
[2415.32 - 2418.20] something like that and when you get
[2417.40 - 2420.52] that
[2418.20 - 2422.68] puncture you you think you're going to
[2420.52 - 2424.92] go home with that after that test and
[2422.68 - 2428.52] you may but you end up with this raging
[2424.92 - 2430.28] fever unbelievable pain absess growing
[2428.52 - 2432.44] in the colon and you're back in the
[2430.28 - 2435.04] hospital I've known people after the
[2432.44 - 2436.88] colon oopy I've known people that have
[2435.04 - 2441.20] had to sit in the hospital for 6 months
[2436.88 - 2443.32] after that baby just totally just 6
[2441.20 - 2445.64] months Ley
[2443.32 - 2448.20] gut here's an example if you get
[2445.64 - 2450.88] diverticulosis and you got those
[2448.20 - 2452.88] pockets and when those Pockets even leak
[2450.88 - 2455.80] the slightest bit because they get so
[2452.88 - 2457.40] bad the pockets get so bad and and and
[2455.80 - 2459.28] they rupture these little pockets and
[2457.40 - 2462.44] there's lots of strap and ecoli in these
[2459.28 - 2465.52] little pockets and they rupture so bad
[2462.44 - 2467.96] that when when even any anything gets on
[2465.52 - 2471.04] the other side of that colon you got a
[2467.96 - 2471.04] fever and you're in the
[2471.12 - 2478.68] hospital there's no having leaky
[2474.64 - 2480.32] gut be your condition unless you're
[2478.68 - 2482.60] literally suffering and you're ending up
[2480.32 - 2485.24] in the hospital with that fever and that
[2482.60 - 2488.00] sickness so the leaky gut hole thing is
[2485.24 - 2490.36] off totally off totally off I can't even
[2488.00 - 2491.88] go I mean I can't even it's so I talked
[2490.36 - 2494.72] about it in book
[2491.88 - 2495.92] one but ammonia gas builds up with
[2494.72 - 2497.36] everything I told you about how the
[2495.92 - 2500.96] liver works and how nothing's breaking
[2497.36 - 2504.76] down and how everything goes rancid and
[2500.96 - 2506.72] and I told you that was telling you that
[2504.76 - 2510.28] that's the ammonia gas builds off of
[2506.72 - 2514.12] that rancidity that rancid those
[2510.28 - 2516.04] rancid pieces of food rancid fat the
[2514.12 - 2518.92] liver collects as much as if it it is as
[2516.04 - 2520.80] it can out of the bloodstream and the
[2518.92 - 2522.56] liver becomes fatty because it's trying
[2520.80 - 2526.00] to save you in different
[2522.56 - 2527.40] ways but it it's all going down into the
[2526.00 - 2530.32] intestinal tract and there's a Feeding
[2527.40 - 2534.36] Frenzy going on on top of it and and and
[2530.32 - 2536.52] and gases are produced from The Feeding
[2534.36 - 2538.76] Frenzy and not only that though the
[2536.52 - 2541.28] rancid nature most importantly the
[2538.76 - 2544.76] rancid nature of the food because of the
[2541.28 - 2547.32] weak gut releases a gas that gas is
[2544.76 - 2549.20] ammonia ammonia isn't leaky gut it has
[2547.32 - 2552.92] ghostlike qualities it can go through a
[2549.20 - 2555.92] bone ammonia can go through a
[2552.92 - 2559.00] bone literally goes through your bones
[2555.92 - 2561.64] it can pass through you and out of your
[2559.00 - 2563.72] skin like a ghost walking through a
[2561.64 - 2566.96] castle and going right through
[2563.72 - 2569.04] Stone right through Stone so ammonia
[2566.96 - 2570.92] just literally it can go through
[2569.04 - 2572.32] everything it's not about just going
[2570.92 - 2574.12] through the lining of the colon or the
[2572.32 - 2575.68] intestinal tract guys it's not about
[2574.12 - 2578.44] that and into the bloodstream and make
[2575.68 - 2581.88] you sick and it doesn't necessarily make
[2578.44 - 2584.36] you that sick when it even enters in the
[2581.88 - 2587.64] bloodstream so it's called ammonia
[2584.36 - 2590.20] permeability but what it does is it can
[2587.64 - 2592.80] go through bones it can go through your
[2590.20 - 2594.36] teeth it it'll just go through you just
[2592.80 - 2597.00] right through you and out whatever part
[2594.36 - 2597.96] of the skin it's going to go out that's
[2597.00 - 2600.16] what this
[2597.96 - 2601.64] does and and it's not good for you and
[2600.16 - 2605.40] it's not healthy for
[2601.64 - 2608.08] you but that's that's really as about as
[2605.40 - 2610.32] extent of Le gut as you can go and it's
[2608.08 - 2612.68] not leaky gut that's not leaky gut
[2610.32 - 2614.84] ammonia permeability is not really leaky
[2612.68 - 2616.80] gut at all because there's nothing
[2614.84 - 2619.24] leaking out of your gut because ammonia
[2616.80 - 2621.04] will will leak through anything it'll go
[2619.24 - 2622.96] through anything in the body there's
[2621.04 - 2625.32] nothing that can stop it not an organ
[2622.96 - 2627.48] nothing it just goes through it has a
[2625.32 - 2629.16] pass to go through everything in every
[2627.48 - 2631.60] crevice and drive through every single
[2629.16 - 2633.72] cell there is to get out of your
[2631.60 - 2635.96] body well that's what it
[2633.72 - 2637.44] does even when the liver tries to be
[2635.96 - 2640.32] that that hero like it is and try to
[2637.44 - 2644.48] collect it and gather it and and and and
[2640.32 - 2646.16] suck it up it just goes right through it
[2644.48 - 2650.04] again
[2646.16 - 2652.92] so um so as far as the leaky gut thing
[2650.04 - 2655.56] no no no no but there's
[2652.92 - 2656.96] neurotoxins that are a different kind of
[2655.56 - 2658.12] poison that get into the bloodstream
[2656.96 - 2659.32] that are in the bloodstream and they get
[2658.12 - 2662.48] in the bloodstream from the liver and
[2659.32 - 2665.24] they account for so many symptoms that
[2662.48 - 2667.12] are being bagged into thyroid it's
[2665.24 - 2668.44] unbelievable right now everything's
[2667.12 - 2670.12] being bagged into thyroid chronic
[2668.44 - 2671.28] fatigue syndrome oh it's your thyroid
[2670.12 - 2672.84] after all so that's what they're all
[2671.28 - 2675.00] trying to do now that's what the experts
[2672.84 - 2678.32] are trying to do now I can't tell you
[2675.00 - 2680.24] how off this is it's not on at all it's
[2678.32 - 2684.08] not in your favor it's not on it's not
[2680.24 - 2685.76] real what happens is that when when you
[2684.08 - 2687.92] now chronic fatigue syndrome gets thrown
[2685.76 - 2689.32] into the thyroid problem or it'll go get
[2687.92 - 2690.76] thrown into Lyme disease one or the
[2689.32 - 2691.96] other and everybody with lime disase has
[2690.76 - 2694.20] thyroid problems and now they're all
[2691.96 - 2696.60] confused thinking okay maybe it's a
[2694.20 - 2699.80] thyroid problem in the end now too
[2696.60 - 2701.48] but it's not it's just chronic fatigue
[2699.80 - 2704.52] your chronic fatigue or somebody's
[2701.48 - 2706.88] chronic fatigue is is another symptom
[2704.52 - 2708.92] that's Epstein bar creating that your
[2706.88 - 2710.48] thyroid being off for not doing that
[2708.92 - 2713.56] good it's a whole another symptom it's a
[2710.48 - 2715.32] whole another thing going on it's
[2713.56 - 2717.76] separate
[2715.32 - 2719.00] separate it's not the thyroid creating
[2717.76 - 2721.04] the
[2719.00 - 2723.64] fatigue even
[2721.04 - 2726.64] if I mean I know people missing their
[2723.64 - 2728.40] thyroids they have no fatigue
[2726.64 - 2731.96] I know people missing their
[2728.40 - 2735.72] thyroids that are not even on
[2731.96 - 2735.72] medication that don't have
[2736.96 - 2742.84] fatigue so I mean there's so many holes
[2740.72 - 2745.08] in the trendy theories that they're just
[2742.84 - 2748.68] trying to all bag up right
[2745.08 - 2751.76] now so anyway let's see if we can talk
[2748.68 - 2754.60] about some more stuff puffy face puffy
[2751.76 - 2756.40] eyes that's liver and lymphatic system
[2754.60 - 2760.08] it's not
[2756.40 - 2761.68] it's not you know just the thyroid
[2760.08 - 2764.92] that's not the
[2761.68 - 2766.48] thyroid now with hyperthyroid you can
[2764.92 - 2769.64] get the bulging eyes that's different
[2766.48 - 2771.84] than puffy eyes puffy puffy face puffy
[2769.64 - 2774.16] eyes puffy face gets thrown into
[2771.84 - 2776.76] hypothyroid no it's just that somebody
[2774.16 - 2779.28] with hypothyroid also has a really
[2776.76 - 2783.48] really toxic sluggish liver and
[2779.28 - 2785.88] lymphatic system the that's how it
[2783.48 - 2790.24] works oh what's the symptoms of hypo
[2785.88 - 2793.84] thyroid oh puffy eyes um puffy face um
[2790.24 - 2796.64] no no no
[2793.84 - 2798.72] no it just so happens somebody has a
[2796.64 - 2800.56] thyroid problem too but they also the
[2798.72 - 2802.20] liver and lymphatic system is creating
[2800.56 - 2805.32] puffy eyes puffy face because someone
[2802.20 - 2809.36] else can have a thyroid problem all the
[2805.32 - 2812.56] same with no puffy eyes puffy
[2809.36 - 2814.52] face I mean honestly honestly you guys
[2812.56 - 2816.56] you wouldn't I mean why isn't anybody
[2814.52 - 2818.32] even focusing
[2816.56 - 2821.88] out there
[2818.32 - 2824.16] and figuring this out yet cuz they're
[2821.88 - 2825.76] not going to we have to do it and you
[2824.16 - 2827.84] have to be the expert and we have to do
[2825.76 - 2829.76] it spirit said to me a long ago you have
[2827.84 - 2831.52] to do it I said I don't want to do it
[2829.76 - 2834.72] there says no you have to do it I picked
[2831.52 - 2836.28] you I I go I don't want to do it I don't
[2834.72 - 2838.32] I don't care when I was younger I was
[2836.28 - 2840.36] like I don't care I just want to have
[2838.32 - 2843.48] fun or do something
[2840.36 - 2847.04] else and spirit says no no no you have
[2843.48 - 2850.80] to care you're the one why am I the one
[2847.04 - 2852.48] spirit said because you're pretty tough
[2850.80 - 2853.56] I God no I'm not tough spirit says yeah
[2852.48 - 2855.20] you're pretty tough you're going to
[2853.56 - 2857.92] survive this you're going to fight for
[2855.20 - 2860.64] it and survive it and I had to and it
[2857.92 - 2862.20] was no fun so but we're here we're here
[2860.64 - 2865.04] so anyway
[2862.20 - 2868.04] um says puffy eyes puffy face how it
[2865.04 - 2870.16] works bulging eyes for
[2868.04 - 2872.48] hyperthyroid that's because fluid
[2870.16 - 2876.76] retention goes right behind the
[2872.48 - 2878.36] eyes that right there is is viral the
[2876.76 - 2883.32] same virus that creates
[2878.36 - 2885.36] hyperthyroidism um edema so edema edema
[2883.32 - 2887.12] fluid retention that's getting us if if
[2885.36 - 2889.20] a if a doctor can't find a kidney
[2887.12 - 2890.80] condition or a heart condition they
[2889.20 - 2894.16] associate that immediately with a
[2890.80 - 2896.92] thyroid or hypothyroid edem is a liver
[2894.16 - 2899.28] condition it's an undiagnosed liver
[2896.92 - 2901.40] condition which is part of the gut part
[2899.28 - 2903.76] of the guts well we're on gut health
[2901.40 - 2907.64] today so that's that's the you know part
[2903.76 - 2907.64] of the liver condition
[2907.72 - 2912.24] um so we talked about IBS a little bit
[2910.44 - 2915.16] but we can go into IBS a little bit more
[2912.24 - 2917.20] IBS is just just basically liver that's
[2915.16 - 2918.68] not functioning good an intestinal tract
[2917.20 - 2920.60] that doesn't have a healthy environment
[2918.68 - 2923.88] because it's got so much petrifying food
[2920.60 - 2926.76] and and uh and putrifying fat and and
[2923.88 - 2928.72] rotting protein so and basically from
[2926.76 - 2930.60] poor digestion hydrochloric acid issues
[2928.72 - 2932.00] and then things like strepa cacus can
[2930.60 - 2935.16] really get out of control and that's
[2932.00 - 2937.16] what IBS is um you can get swelling
[2935.16 - 2939.48] inside the the colon lots of swelling it
[2937.16 - 2941.00] can get inflamed um you can have
[2939.48 - 2942.56] diarrhea and you can have constipation
[2941.00 - 2945.96] diarrhea constipation you could have
[2942.56 - 2948.32] parts of the colon elocal valve all that
[2945.96 - 2950.88] be um you could have this an inflamed
[2948.32 - 2954.44] seeum you can have the ilocal valve
[2950.88 - 2957.04] being inflamed uh due to bacteria and
[2954.44 - 2960.08] inflammation because of bacteria that's
[2957.04 - 2962.16] uh IBS you can have even you could be
[2960.08 - 2964.52] viral and have a lot of viral toxins
[2962.16 - 2967.36] inside the intestinal tract that cause
[2964.52 - 2969.36] ibs2 as well they'll probably just say
[2967.36 - 2970.12] IBS is autoimmune down the road too
[2969.36 - 2971.40] because they're just going to have to
[2970.12 - 2972.48] point to everything being the body
[2971.40 - 2973.68] destroying itself because they don't
[2972.48 - 2975.80] know what's wrong with anybody and
[2973.68 - 2977.52] that's what I talk about in thyroid
[2975.80 - 2979.80] healing because they don't know what's
[2977.52 - 2981.40] wrong with anybody so they're just going
[2979.80 - 2983.76] to point it out to being it's it's
[2981.40 - 2986.60] either your genes or your body's
[2983.76 - 2989.68] attacking itself excuse me going to
[2986.60 - 2991.72] clear my throat here so
[2989.68 - 2993.08] um so that's what happens so
[2991.72 - 2995.20] everything's going to go to autoimmune
[2993.08 - 2996.48] no matter what even CBO I mean sibo
[2995.20 - 2999.40] whatever even
[2996.48 - 3001.60] IBS you know all of that's going to go
[2999.40 - 3003.88] there all of that's going to go there
[3001.60 - 3006.04] now you can have gastritis without
[3003.88 - 3007.84] having a lot of gas I want you to know
[3006.04 - 3011.84] this this is something I haven't talked
[3007.84 - 3014.32] about um anywhere too um so anybody with
[3011.84 - 3017.56] gastritis you may not get diagnosed with
[3014.32 - 3020.52] gastritis but you can have gastritis it
[3017.56 - 3023.08] depends on how toxic the gas is so you
[3020.52 - 3026.92] can have bloating and pain and not move
[3023.08 - 3030.84] any gas but yet it's there you can have
[3026.92 - 3033.16] no bloating and sharp pains and it be
[3030.84 - 3035.84] little tiny pockets of gas very little
[3033.16 - 3039.64] but the pocket of gas is so
[3035.84 - 3042.20] toxic that literally it hurts the nerves
[3039.64 - 3045.32] so in your intestinal track and this is
[3042.20 - 3047.80] a secret here too and your intestinal
[3045.32 - 3049.24] tra you've got you know all your nerves
[3047.80 - 3051.36] go to your intestinal tra it's like your
[3049.24 - 3053.80] second brain it's kind of the second or
[3051.36 - 3056.80] third brain in the body so all your
[3053.80 - 3059.60] nerves go to the intestin inal
[3056.80 - 3061.12] track and um basically your intestinal
[3059.60 - 3062.88] tra is like a puppet with a whole bunch
[3061.12 - 3064.72] of strings attached to it somebody kind
[3062.88 - 3067.64] of dangling that you know dangling a
[3064.72 - 3070.24] puppet making it dance okay so the
[3067.64 - 3072.52] controller on top who's doing all that
[3070.24 - 3075.80] is the
[3072.52 - 3078.00] brain and the brain is is giving orders
[3075.80 - 3080.92] nervous system is giving orders directly
[3078.00 - 3082.88] to every single every single spot in the
[3080.92 - 3086.12] intestinal tract and
[3082.88 - 3088.12] colon and um
[3086.12 - 3090.28] so what you know so what's happening
[3088.12 - 3092.00] there what's happening there is that
[3090.28 - 3093.92] there's so many nerves going on in there
[3092.00 - 3095.84] that have even even slightly inflamed in
[3093.92 - 3098.96] the colon or intestinal tract if
[3095.84 - 3102.16] slightly inflamed if a little pocket of
[3098.96 - 3104.28] gas that happens to be very toxic from
[3102.16 - 3107.20] either you know some virus viruses or
[3104.28 - 3109.16] toxic coming you know you know basically
[3107.20 - 3112.60] the liver has so much poison in it or
[3109.16 - 3114.44] you got the too much bacteria sibo
[3112.60 - 3116.56] creating bacteria like the strepa cacus
[3114.44 - 3118.52] going on and you get this little gas
[3116.56 - 3121.16] bubble and that gas bubble's just moving
[3118.52 - 3123.60] around and it hits hot spots it hits hot
[3121.16 - 3126.12] nerves inflamed areas and when it hits a
[3123.60 - 3128.12] hot nerve oh man you got cramp you got
[3126.12 - 3129.28] pain you got a sharp pain you got all
[3128.12 - 3132.08] these different things but you don't
[3129.28 - 3136.04] even have to be releasing a lot of
[3132.08 - 3140.44] gas in order to have this type of
[3136.04 - 3143.48] gastritis so that's something to to uh
[3140.44 - 3145.56] Chomp into that's some information there
[3143.48 - 3147.04] I want to talk about insatiable hunger
[3145.56 - 3150.68] this is interesting because insatable
[3147.04 - 3153.28] hunger is being being thrown into
[3150.68 - 3154.84] hyperthyroid it's like a definitive
[3153.28 - 3157.12] symptom right now today of like
[3154.84 - 3159.12] hyperthyroid insatable hunger now I know
[3157.12 - 3163.40] this isn't a hyperthyroid
[3159.12 - 3164.96] webinar but this is a gut health
[3163.40 - 3168.80] webinar
[3164.96 - 3171.52] so insatiable hunger is in the gut
[3168.80 - 3174.36] health Arena even though it gets thrown
[3171.52 - 3176.44] into a mental disorder it gets thrown
[3174.36 - 3179.64] into a mental disease it gets thrown
[3176.44 - 3181.44] into some kind of okay I love when the a
[3179.64 - 3183.08] Theory comes out where it's like well no
[3181.44 - 3186.28] there's a shut off switch in the brain
[3183.08 - 3188.04] and you're not producing a a a chemical
[3186.28 - 3190.08] that actually is supposed to do you know
[3188.04 - 3192.68] supposed to shut down your hunger I love
[3190.08 - 3196.40] when that that stuff happen starts to
[3192.68 - 3199.56] happen being sarcastic now we know that
[3196.40 - 3202.40] um but insatiable hunger gets totally
[3199.56 - 3205.68] thrown into the basket of
[3202.40 - 3207.48] hyperthyroidism and the irony is is is
[3205.68 - 3209.12] there's more people insation hungry that
[3207.48 - 3211.84] have
[3209.12 - 3214.12] hypothyroidism the other irony is
[3211.84 - 3218.12] there's just as many people is
[3214.12 - 3221.32] that that are insatiably hungry that
[3218.12 - 3224.80] aren't dealing with a thyroid problem at
[3221.32 - 3226.24] all but like I said it's it's got to go
[3224.80 - 3229.88] somewhere if nobody knows what's going
[3226.24 - 3231.80] on with anybody if nobody knows what's
[3229.88 - 3234.04] going on anybody with anybody out there
[3231.80 - 3236.64] you got to throw you got to knock the
[3234.04 - 3238.32] pull balls into one of the pockets so
[3236.64 - 3239.72] you know so the whole thing with
[3238.32 - 3242.04] insatable Hunger gets thrown into
[3239.72 - 3244.92] hyperthyroid now ins satiable hunger is
[3242.04 - 3247.28] a liver glucose deficiency so it's a
[3244.92 - 3250.04] glycogen storage deficiency in the liver
[3247.28 - 3251.48] so anybody who's just really hungry or a
[3250.04 - 3255.16] little bit more hungry than somebody
[3251.48 - 3256.52] else or too hungry people would think
[3255.16 - 3258.00] you know they can't get enough carbs
[3256.52 - 3261.60] they can't get enough anything they just
[3258.00 - 3263.52] they're always hungry that is or if they
[3261.60 - 3265.16] feel like they binge all the time you
[3263.52 - 3266.24] know or they have to binge or something
[3265.16 - 3267.68] then they go without food then they
[3266.24 - 3269.44] binge and it just there's just always
[3267.68 - 3271.60] this hunger that just takes over and
[3269.44 - 3274.00] they they can't put down a piece of food
[3271.60 - 3277.08] or something like that I mean whatever
[3274.00 - 3279.24] it is that they talk about out there
[3277.08 - 3281.28] whatever that that's that what that is
[3279.24 - 3282.80] that's a glycogen glycogen is glucose
[3281.28 - 3284.12] that stores up in a liver in a good
[3282.80 - 3286.68] liver and meaning in a liver that's
[3284.12 - 3288.72] really strong and healthy it stores up
[3286.68 - 3289.80] and it sits in there so it stops ins
[3288.72 - 3291.84] satiable
[3289.80 - 3293.84] hunger but what happens is when our
[3291.84 - 3296.48] liers weaken once again due to the
[3293.84 - 3298.88] process like talk the better
[3296.48 - 3301.44] earlier what happens you lose your
[3298.88 - 3303.40] glucose Storage storage your glucose
[3301.44 - 3306.52] storage goes away your glycogen storage
[3303.40 - 3309.80] starts to dissolve in the liver so then
[3306.52 - 3312.72] the message is the liver sending it out
[3309.80 - 3314.12] of of insatiable hunger to try to get
[3312.72 - 3316.68] carbs back
[3314.12 - 3318.20] in and a lot of times people don't just
[3316.68 - 3321.28] know how to do that they don't know how
[3318.20 - 3323.92] to just eat some potatoes and some you
[3321.28 - 3325.68] know fruits and other things like that
[3323.92 - 3328.04] instead they're eating eting all kinds
[3325.68 - 3329.32] of things which causes problem too
[3328.04 - 3332.36] because if you're eating all kinds of
[3329.32 - 3335.24] stuff the liver is too weak to kind of
[3332.36 - 3337.24] break it all down the bile can't break
[3335.24 - 3341.12] you know break the fat down hydrochloric
[3337.24 - 3342.60] acid can't break down the protein and it
[3341.12 - 3344.24] just becomes a hash Posh of different
[3342.60 - 3346.00] things too much fat in the blood too
[3344.24 - 3348.32] much fat in the blood stops sugars from
[3346.00 - 3350.08] building up in the liver if you can't
[3348.32 - 3353.28] build up sugar in the liver you can't
[3350.08 - 3355.32] get your glycogen storage back up to par
[3353.28 - 3357.24] inside the liver if you can't get your
[3355.32 - 3359.68] glycogen storage back up the par inside
[3357.24 - 3361.64] the liver then you get insatiable hunger
[3359.68 - 3364.48] then you keep on eating more and more
[3361.64 - 3367.32] Abominations of whatever you can
[3364.48 - 3370.80] find but really what the liver wants is
[3367.32 - 3373.16] low fat the liver wants lowfat low fat
[3370.80 - 3375.00] and low protein and what the liver
[3373.16 - 3378.00] really wants is lots of fruits lots of
[3375.00 - 3379.88] vegetables lots of fruits sweet potatoes
[3378.00 - 3381.76] winter squash things that have
[3379.88 - 3382.56] carbohydrates but it doesn't want all
[3381.76 - 3385.36] the
[3382.56 - 3386.96] fat this way can break the food down
[3385.36 - 3389.68] better with the bile salt and the
[3386.96 - 3391.88] hydrochloric acid that's been weakened
[3389.68 - 3393.72] and then the sugars can actually fill
[3391.88 - 3395.32] the liver and all the fat in the blood
[3393.72 - 3398.04] won't get in the way because you won't
[3395.32 - 3400.16] be eating so much heavy
[3398.04 - 3402.32] fat and that's what takes care of
[3400.16 - 3407.44] insatiable
[3402.32 - 3409.84] hunger so that's another secret
[3407.44 - 3412.96] um well I mean we got so much to talk
[3409.84 - 3415.20] about I'm just I'm just kind of I'm in a
[3412.96 - 3418.20] place where do I want to go into be be
[3415.20 - 3419.92] cautious about some things we do for the
[3418.20 - 3421.24] intestinal tract do I want to go into
[3419.92 - 3422.12] that I think I want to go into that a
[3421.24 - 3425.04] little
[3422.12 - 3426.92] bit okay sodium bicarbonate that's a
[3425.04 - 3429.16] trend and everything what what I find
[3426.92 - 3430.44] about that when we eat that try to get
[3429.16 - 3432.52] that in the intestinal tract to make us
[3430.44 - 3434.48] either alkaline or drop down candid
[3432.52 - 3438.04] levels or whatever somebody just thinks
[3434.48 - 3439.36] of each day um you don't want to do the
[3438.04 - 3441.12] sodium
[3439.36 - 3442.92] bicarbonate way too hard on the
[3441.12 - 3446.84] intestinal tract way too hard on the
[3442.92 - 3448.64] liver it's not a good thing to do so um
[3446.84 - 3450.28] I would consider backing down on that if
[3448.64 - 3451.84] you know someone doing it or whatever
[3450.28 - 3454.48] just just you just don't want to do it
[3451.84 - 3458.08] anymore um not good for the intestinal
[3454.48 - 3460.20] tract lining not good for good bacteria
[3458.08 - 3462.76] doesn't help good bacteria you don't
[3460.20 - 3464.32] want to injure your good bacteria so
[3462.76 - 3466.32] that's the whole thing so the whole you
[3464.32 - 3467.80] know the whole I mean I've seen some
[3466.32 - 3469.32] terrible things happen from sodium
[3467.80 - 3471.08] bicarbonate I've seen people with the
[3469.32 - 3472.88] worst Crohn's or the worst colitis
[3471.08 - 3475.00] actually take that stuff and literally
[3472.88 - 3478.92] end up in the hospital it's not not
[3475.00 - 3481.00] smart I've seen even worse happen to
[3478.92 - 3484.60] people who've taken dious Earth
[3481.00 - 3487.20] particles um look the one thing about
[3484.60 - 3490.32] picking on a product or picking on
[3487.20 - 3493.00] something is you know I get people angry
[3490.32 - 3495.72] I understand that but I also have to
[3493.00 - 3497.60] watch your back um I'd stay away from
[3495.72 - 3500.80] diet Tous Earth particles because it's
[3497.60 - 3503.12] too harsh on the intestinal Linings and
[3500.80 - 3505.92] it tends to saturate the Linings and not
[3503.12 - 3507.96] leave meaning it leaves eventually it
[3505.92 - 3511.76] just takes too long to leave so it
[3507.96 - 3514.84] Smothers it suffocates good bacteria on
[3511.76 - 3518.32] the lining it also creates malabsorption
[3514.84 - 3520.48] too much dious Earth particles stop
[3518.32 - 3522.88] absorption does it doesn't even allow
[3520.48 - 3524.72] candida to absorb for you properly it
[3522.88 - 3527.24] doesn't even allow your body to absorb
[3524.72 - 3529.28] properly so dious Earth particles was a
[3527.24 - 3531.64] really bad Trend in a really bad fad
[3529.28 - 3533.80] it's just that what happens is you know
[3531.64 - 3535.12] once these things get rolling there
[3533.80 - 3536.64] ain't no stopp
[3535.12 - 3537.96] [Laughter]
[3536.64 - 3539.60] once these things get rolling there
[3537.96 - 3542.12] ain't no stopping I don't know what else
[3539.60 - 3543.88] to say out there you know um so I would
[3542.12 - 3547.40] avoid diet tomas's Earth particles since
[3543.88 - 3549.00] we're talking about gut health and um I
[3547.40 - 3550.92] didn't want to forget that if you've
[3549.00 - 3553.20] already taken it fine whatever just stop
[3550.92 - 3555.88] taking it okay some people feel okay
[3553.20 - 3557.80] with it some people you know I find that
[3555.88 - 3560.28] women they're the ones that get the
[3557.80 - 3562.76] sickest from it uh men who don't have
[3560.28 - 3565.20] intestinal tract problems they can tend
[3562.76 - 3568.28] to do it not really feel a difference
[3565.20 - 3571.48] they don't know it's all good whatever
[3568.28 - 3573.84] but um but if a guy has a really bad
[3571.48 - 3575.64] intestinal tract problem that it will be
[3573.84 - 3578.04] bad I've seen people get sick that way
[3575.64 - 3580.32] guys get sick women get way sicker from
[3578.04 - 3582.48] it um way sicker from it I've seen some
[3580.32 - 3587.00] terrible things happen so just hold off
[3582.48 - 3589.80] diet tomus Earth particles as a remedy
[3587.00 - 3593.76] as a detoxification method or
[3589.80 - 3598.48] remedy which leads me to Clays Clays
[3593.76 - 3601.60] clays CL l a y right clay I think that's
[3598.48 - 3605.00] how you spell clay clay isn't a good
[3601.60 - 3607.60] thing either so Clay is way too harsh
[3605.00 - 3610.00] way too abrasive like sandpaper on
[3607.60 - 3612.32] intestinal Linings you don't want to
[3610.00 - 3614.36] sandpaper your intestinal Linings when
[3612.32 - 3616.12] your nervous system delivers messages
[3614.36 - 3617.48] down to your intestinal tract and your
[3616.12 - 3621.12] intestinal
[3617.48 - 3624.92] tract is now doing the peristaltic
[3621.12 - 3627.40] action it's it's trying to move that
[3624.92 - 3631.28] clay and then Foods going down grabbing
[3627.40 - 3633.64] onto that clay and rubbing it on the
[3631.28 - 3635.88] sides of the intestinal tract rubbing it
[3633.64 - 3638.16] on the sides of the intestinal tract so
[3635.88 - 3639.64] you're getting clay like sandpaper fine
[3638.16 - 3642.64] sandp paper you know there's something
[3639.64 - 3644.16] called bonami bonami or something I
[3642.64 - 3645.96] don't know if if you have to say it in a
[3644.16 - 3647.56] fresh in a French way I think it's you
[3645.96 - 3649.96] know I don't know if it's a French word
[3647.56 - 3653.28] or whatever right bone bonami whatever I
[3649.96 - 3655.56] don't know bone Amy that stuff in a can
[3653.28 - 3658.04] right you know that's I take that stuff
[3655.56 - 3660.16] and I I like that stuff don't eat it I'm
[3658.04 - 3662.28] not talking about eating it I take the
[3660.16 - 3666.52] can and I put it in the sink and I scrub
[3662.28 - 3668.88] out the sink it's a fine fine fine
[3666.52 - 3670.84] powder it's a fine
[3668.88 - 3672.32] powder you know I'll throw it in the
[3670.84 - 3674.72] toilet and I'll scrub out the toilet the
[3672.32 - 3678.68] toilet toilet brush with that
[3674.72 - 3681.08] stuff and it doesn't feel gritty it
[3678.68 - 3682.96] doesn't feel like sandpaper at all feels
[3681.08 - 3684.96] really smooth for some reason when you
[3682.96 - 3686.92] put it in your fingers and you rub it
[3684.96 - 3691.56] together it's like super smooth it's
[3686.92 - 3694.52] like soft really soft but when I powder
[3691.56 - 3697.96] it up in the kitchen sink or in the
[3694.52 - 3700.60] bathroom sink and I take a sponge or I
[3697.96 - 3702.68] take a cloth and I it just gets rid of
[3700.60 - 3704.60] every stain and you could just you could
[3702.68 - 3707.76] just scrub and wipe and you could get
[3704.60 - 3710.00] rid of every stain even like water
[3707.76 - 3712.08] stains that have copper in the pipes and
[3710.00 - 3713.76] everything else you know all that all of
[3712.08 - 3716.68] a sudden you're you got a sparkling
[3713.76 - 3718.56] clean sink in stainless steel sink too
[3716.68 - 3720.84] in the kitchen you can get it like
[3718.56 - 3726.56] spotless clean
[3720.84 - 3729.76] looking and yeah why they're really soft
[3726.56 - 3731.84] and smooth and silky stuff because it's
[3729.76 - 3734.92] it it acts of sandpaper once you apply
[3731.84 - 3737.92] pressure so when you have Clay and even
[3734.92 - 3741.40] dious Earth particles and it's on the
[3737.92 - 3744.08] lining of the intestinal tract and
[3741.40 - 3748.88] colon what happens is food will go
[3744.08 - 3752.52] against it and rub it'll put pressure if
[3748.88 - 3754.28] you eat a bigger meal more pressure more
[3752.52 - 3756.20] pressure I'm not saying don't eat big
[3754.28 - 3759.32] meals I mean whatever you eat meals that
[3756.20 - 3763.60] you feel comfortable with more
[3759.32 - 3767.20] pressure and it rubs rubs along the
[3763.60 - 3771.52] sides of the colon in the intestinal
[3767.20 - 3774.72] tract and it doesn't clean it it doesn't
[3771.52 - 3776.48] clean it it's not what it's doing not
[3774.72 - 3778.68] what the clay is
[3776.48 - 3780.52] doing somebody's probably out there
[3778.68 - 3782.08] saying yeah what about animals though
[3780.52 - 3784.24] they eat clay and they stay healthy they
[3782.08 - 3787.04] do that they're known to eat some clay
[3784.24 - 3789.84] your intestinal track isn't built like a
[3787.04 - 3793.24] deer's intestinal track I can tell you
[3789.84 - 3798.80] that it's not built like a deer's int a
[3793.24 - 3802.32] deer can Munch up the most impossible
[3798.80 - 3805.96] things and the most toxic things in
[3802.32 - 3808.28] swallow sticks and Twigs with toxic
[3805.96 - 3811.32] alkaloids I mean I'm talking about real
[3808.28 - 3812.88] toxic alkaloids make you sick I mean put
[3811.32 - 3817.16] you in a hospital you ate all those
[3812.88 - 3819.88] Twigs if you even if you even uh Juiced
[3817.16 - 3822.20] those twigs and Juice those alkaloids
[3819.88 - 3824.28] out of you know different Twigs from all
[3822.20 - 3826.16] kinds of different levels of of of I
[3824.28 - 3829.52] mean all different species of bushes
[3826.16 - 3832.00] shrubs and and trees man you even drank
[3829.52 - 3835.00] a an ounce of that juice you'd be in the
[3832.00 - 3837.48] hospital the tannins in there which just
[3835.00 - 3840.56] to just annihilate you meaning it
[3837.48 - 3842.36] wouldn't kill you You' be so
[3840.56 - 3846.04] sick
[3842.36 - 3848.88] um even Maple Ser I mean even Maple
[3846.04 - 3851.20] Water Maple Water that they boil away to
[3848.88 - 3853.60] make maple syrup Maple
[3851.20 - 3855.12] Water has so much Tan in it that if you
[3853.60 - 3858.56] drink too much Maple Water you'll just
[3855.12 - 3860.36] be like drooling you'll drool I I
[3858.56 - 3862.76] remember I was actually I even did that
[3860.36 - 3864.28] one time I I love Maple Water you can
[3862.76 - 3866.00] only have a little bit of it this stuff
[3864.28 - 3867.72] is medicinal Maple Water is different
[3866.00 - 3869.96] than you know like maple syrup when they
[3867.72 - 3872.32] boil it down to the sugars Maple Water
[3869.96 - 3874.60] has a lot of tannning in it a lot of
[3872.32 - 3876.56] tannin it's hidden in there they drink
[3874.60 - 3880.20] it it's like wow that was the freshest
[3876.56 - 3882.68] cleanest water I've ever consumed it was
[3880.20 - 3884.60] like a miracle and it is when you drink
[3882.68 - 3887.44] a little bit of Maple Water it's like a
[3884.60 - 3890.68] miracle but let me have more Spirit like
[3887.44 - 3892.40] try not to overdo it don't overdo it I'm
[3890.68 - 3894.84] like no I'm I'm I'm with a friend we're
[3892.40 - 3897.20] in the woods it's his maple it's his
[3894.84 - 3900.32] Maple set up he's got it all set up he's
[3897.20 - 3903.64] got the containers up against the
[3900.32 - 3905.20] trees and you know we're Upstate and
[3903.64 - 3906.84] he's you know he's doing it we're up
[3905.20 - 3910.28] state in Maine and he's doing it and
[3906.84 - 3912.84] we're so this is great and I'm like I'm
[3910.28 - 3914.92] guzzling the stuff I'm like this is
[3912.84 - 3917.08] incredible this reminds me of coconut
[3914.92 - 3918.84] water when I'm drinking fresh coconut
[3917.08 - 3920.60] water out of the coconut and and you
[3918.84 - 3923.16] know and I'm drinking them and you I'm
[3920.60 - 3924.96] drinking it and all of a sudden I'm like
[3923.16 - 3927.12] oh crap
[3924.96 - 3930.00] I didn't say crap I said the bad
[3927.12 - 3933.00] word at when it happened I think I said
[3930.00 - 3936.60] a couple of bad words I think I said I
[3933.00 - 3939.36] said the other bad word too oh
[3936.60 - 3942.76] bleep and you know and it was like I
[3939.36 - 3944.08] feel those tannins uhoh overdid it and
[3942.76 - 3945.12] spirit was like told you but when are
[3944.08 - 3947.00] you going to learn you don't listen to
[3945.12 - 3950.80] me sometimes I said yeah I know I'm
[3947.00 - 3952.84] stubborn and you know and so it was the
[3950.80 - 3956.60] tannins and that was just and that was
[3952.84 - 3959.80] Maple Water and I was drooling I had the
[3956.60 - 3962.68] drools for like three days until this
[3959.80 - 3966.96] day when I think of maple water drinking
[3962.68 - 3970.04] Maple Water my stomach turns and I feel
[3966.96 - 3973.20] nauseous tannin can actually give you a
[3970.04 - 3975.16] memory that connects to the nerves that
[3973.20 - 3977.56] were affected by the
[3975.16 - 3979.72] tannin so I like Maple Water I just
[3977.56 - 3982.56] can't drink it and if someone does drink
[3979.72 - 3984.40] it just drink a little and then have
[3982.56 - 3985.96] another you know week later drink a
[3984.40 - 3987.80] little or a couple days later drink a
[3985.96 - 3989.40] little I believe in Maple Water so I'm
[3987.80 - 3992.04] not anti- Maple Water I believe in it I
[3989.40 - 3994.32] want I want people to try it just don't
[3992.04 - 3997.64] drink a ton of that stuff don't drink a
[3994.32 - 4000.60] case of that stuff or like I did a
[3997.64 - 4002.64] gallon of that stuff at once too much
[4000.60 - 4004.52] tannin at once I have a memory to it why
[4002.64 - 4007.84] am I talking about the
[4004.52 - 4010.40] tannins I'm talking about the tannins
[4007.84 - 4015.32] because a
[4010.40 - 4018.92] deer or any other animals a deer has a
[4015.32 - 4020.76] different intestinal tract than us okay
[4018.92 - 4023.80] it can eat things you couldn't believe
[4020.76 - 4025.48] it can eat it can eat clay yeah it can
[4023.80 - 4027.68] eat clay it can eat dirt it can eat clay
[4025.48 - 4029.52] no problem it can eat clay it can eat
[4027.68 - 4031.48] different varieties of Clays and
[4029.52 - 4033.96] different at different
[4031.48 - 4038.04] places on the
[4033.96 - 4039.60] planet but it can do that for a reason
[4038.04 - 4043.08] the intestinal tra is built entirely
[4039.60 - 4044.88] different than ours in many ways and we
[4043.08 - 4046.84] can't handle that CL and like I said the
[4044.88 - 4048.68] bonami and the sink we can't we can't
[4046.84 - 4051.68] handle that
[4048.68 - 4053.92] clay so just giving you that as another
[4051.68 - 4057.48] another another tidbit here that's what
[4053.92 - 4059.12] I wanted to not forget I feel like that
[4057.48 - 4060.32] after we explored so much with the gut
[4059.12 - 4063.28] and everything else in the gut health
[4060.32 - 4065.36] that I was going to forget that um any
[4063.28 - 4067.96] any herble tea going on anybody got
[4065.36 - 4069.52] something can I drink something now it's
[4067.96 - 4071.68] we're already past an hour we still got
[4069.52 - 4072.92] a ways to go and I'm going to have a sip
[4071.68 - 4075.24] just bear with
[4072.92 - 4078.80] me
[4075.24 - 4081.68] so I could just keep my throat
[4078.80 - 4084.16] moist so the liver's role is to create
[4081.68 - 4086.44] ble to break down fats to thin them out
[4084.16 - 4089.32] in the bloodstream so our heart doesn't
[4086.44 - 4090.64] weaken so our heart isn't bombarded by
[4089.32 - 4092.32] high
[4090.64 - 4095.96] fat
[4092.32 - 4097.96] but what we do is we end up getting in
[4095.96 - 4100.20] trouble and we get our liver broken down
[4097.96 - 4101.68] and it gets stagnant gets sluggish and
[4100.20 - 4104.84] it gets problematic and we can't even
[4101.68 - 4107.00] protect our heart diabetes diabetes is
[4104.84 - 4110.16] going to get thrown into the thyroid
[4107.00 - 4111.52] trap as well you know I guarantee you
[4110.16 - 4114.16] that's going to head into the thyroid
[4111.52 - 4115.24] trap diabetes it's going to be one of
[4114.16 - 4118.76] these things
[4115.24 - 4120.56] where where um it's going to be like
[4118.76 - 4122.64] well you know what diabetics people with
[4120.56 - 4125.08] type two diabetes develop develop a
[4122.64 - 4126.84] thyroid problem so obviously it's the
[4125.08 - 4129.96] thyroid that's it's all part of the
[4126.84 - 4132.80] thyroid no it's it's not the diabetes
[4129.96 - 4136.04] type two diabetes type two is a liver
[4132.80 - 4137.64] condition that's a liver condition
[4136.04 - 4140.04] that's a liver becoming
[4137.64 - 4142.12] dysfunctional and losing its storage
[4140.04 - 4144.60] losing its glucose losing its glyc and
[4142.12 - 4146.80] storage not being able to break down
[4144.60 - 4148.24] fats and then the fats building up
[4146.80 - 4150.04] building up in the heart building up in
[4148.24 - 4152.96] other places building up in the
[4150.04 - 4154.32] bloodstream so it it's really kind of a
[4152.96 - 4157.20] separate
[4154.32 - 4159.92] issue what is
[4157.20 - 4161.36] connected what is connected in general
[4159.92 - 4165.28] with the thyroid and everything else the
[4161.36 - 4167.36] thyroid is a is a symptom become
[4165.28 - 4171.16] symptomatic mean part one of the things
[4167.36 - 4172.80] that gets affected by not by anything
[4171.16 - 4174.20] but something else what happens is when
[4172.80 - 4176.24] we get all these different symptoms that
[4174.20 - 4177.72] are liver related a lot of them we get
[4176.24 - 4179.64] all these different symptoms that are
[4177.72 - 4182.44] being thrown into the thyroid bag
[4179.64 - 4184.64] tingles and numbness confusion brain fog
[4182.44 - 4186.28] aches and pains all these different
[4184.64 - 4189.20] things that are keep that keep on
[4186.28 - 4192.00] getting thrown into the thyroid trap um
[4189.20 - 4194.96] you know symptoms hot flashes uh thrown
[4192.00 - 4196.68] into the thyroid trap um you know the
[4194.96 - 4198.40] the list goes on I'm I'm forgetting
[4196.68 - 4199.56] about a lot of symptoms I'm sure you
[4198.40 - 4201.12] probably are thinking how come he's not
[4199.56 - 4205.96] saying this symptom well it's probably
[4201.12 - 4207.16] that symptom too um and uh so when it
[4205.96 - 4209.24] gets thrown in there there is an
[4207.16 - 4211.28] affiliation affiliation is most these
[4209.24 - 4213.04] symptoms are created by a viral
[4211.28 - 4215.36] condition by the Epstein bar an
[4213.04 - 4217.36] underlying cause it just so happens the
[4215.36 - 4219.40] Epstein bar if you've read book one the
[4217.36 - 4221.04] Epstein bar gets into the thyroid
[4219.40 - 4222.44] causing a thyroid problem too which is
[4221.04 - 4225.12] one of these things but it's not the
[4222.44 - 4229.92] reduction of the thyroid horm hormones
[4225.12 - 4232.36] or the thyroid becoming problematic or
[4229.92 - 4233.80] nodules on the thyroid that are causing
[4232.36 - 4235.88] all these other symptoms that are
[4233.80 - 4237.60] causing these problems and that's the
[4235.88 - 4240.56] that's what we have to get across it's
[4237.60 - 4243.20] important the thyroid you can get a
[4240.56 - 4245.28] temperature fluctuation if a thyroid is
[4243.20 - 4247.60] problematic that's a symptom from the
[4245.28 - 4249.76] thyroid that is one of the symptoms from
[4247.60 - 4252.00] the thyroid the thyroid has very few
[4249.76 - 4253.92] symptoms when you have this is an
[4252.00 - 4256.20] example I have people that don't have
[4253.92 - 4257.44] thyroids or have th their thyroids have
[4256.20 - 4260.96] been killed
[4257.44 - 4263.76] off and they still kept all of their
[4260.96 - 4265.72] other symptoms all of their other
[4263.76 - 4268.00] symptoms there's people that just have
[4265.72 - 4270.32] had hyper hypothyroid sorry
[4268.00 - 4272.20] hypothyroidism Hashimoto they've gotten
[4270.32 - 4274.40] their numbers better their Hashimoto
[4272.20 - 4276.88] even backed down you know and and their
[4274.40 - 4278.20] numbers got better they had hypothyroid
[4276.88 - 4280.44] and their numbers got better and their
[4278.20 - 4282.92] thyroid got better but yet all their
[4280.44 - 4284.44] symptoms stayed all their symptoms
[4282.92 - 4287.00] whatever they were tingles numbness
[4284.44 - 4289.68] vertigo aches and pains your brain fog
[4287.00 - 4292.40] confusion you name it I mean the list
[4289.68 - 4294.40] goes on oh the weight gain if yeah
[4292.40 - 4296.24] weight gain all of it but for some
[4294.40 - 4297.72] reason if thyroid was back to normal the
[4296.24 - 4301.32] doctors
[4297.72 - 4303.40] felt because it wasn't the thyroid that
[4301.32 - 4306.84] created those symptoms to begin
[4303.40 - 4308.44] with so why am I even going here now in
[4306.84 - 4310.52] this webinar because when it comes down
[4308.44 - 4312.56] to the gut when it comes down to our gut
[4310.52 - 4315.96] health and secrets of the gut health and
[4312.56 - 4318.48] everything it's not the thyroid causing
[4315.96 - 4320.72] the gut health problems and that's where
[4318.48 - 4323.32] it's going next that's where we're
[4320.72 - 4326.32] heading now into trendy misinformation
[4323.32 - 4327.92] thyroid world as the books keep on
[4326.32 - 4329.96] getting stamped out with
[4327.92 - 4332.04] misinformation you know listen I
[4329.96 - 4334.60] wouldn't have any right to say that at
[4332.04 - 4336.96] all if if I wasn't giving the given the
[4334.60 - 4339.52] gift that I was given and and that gift
[4336.96 - 4342.04] is for you it wasn't for me I you know
[4339.52 - 4344.00] and I know that I was told that and and
[4342.04 - 4346.56] I was like Hey a gift this is gift for
[4344.00 - 4350.08] me to have it's p this gift isn't for
[4346.56 - 4351.36] you it's not for you okay this you're
[4350.08 - 4354.72] you're you're going to help you're going
[4351.36 - 4357.84] to help but it's not for you all right
[4354.72 - 4359.08] and it's for you guys so that's why it's
[4357.84 - 4362.36] important to know so you're going to
[4359.08 - 4363.60] find that if you had a sibo diagnosis
[4362.36 - 4366.00] you're eventually going to get thrown
[4363.60 - 4368.24] into the thyroid thing with it you know
[4366.00 - 4370.12] along the way I mean seriously and you'd
[4368.24 - 4372.16] think well why would that be small in
[4370.12 - 4375.04] small intestinal track you know you know
[4372.16 - 4377.72] bacterial overgrowth
[4375.04 - 4380.36] why would that get thrown into um into
[4377.72 - 4382.28] thyroid it just it's it's going to it's
[4380.36 - 4384.32] going to you know that's going to be
[4382.28 - 4386.24] kind of thrown in Lecky gut's going to
[4384.32 - 4388.12] get thrown into thyroid everything
[4386.24 - 4391.56] everything gut related is going to get
[4388.12 - 4393.24] thrown bloating cramps in the gut you
[4391.56 - 4394.88] know anything going on in the gut is
[4393.24 - 4396.72] going to get thrown into the thyroid and
[4394.88 - 4398.68] that's that's where it's going so I
[4396.72 - 4402.28] wanted to do a gut health show because
[4398.68 - 4404.48] of this very reason um even Celiac is
[4402.28 - 4405.80] going to get thrown in there
[4404.48 - 4411.12] over
[4405.80 - 4414.08] time so what can we do what can we do I
[4411.12 - 4415.72] mean I can keep on going about the
[4414.08 - 4417.12] Mysteries and the secrets and the truth
[4415.72 - 4419.28] about our gut health and everything
[4417.12 - 4421.72] which I hope you guys find
[4419.28 - 4423.52] interesting but what can we do for it
[4421.72 - 4425.08] and stuff you know the celery juice
[4423.52 - 4426.96] thing many of you know maybe some of you
[4425.08 - 4428.88] were new to this whole thing celery
[4426.96 - 4430.64] juice is undiscovered mineral salt
[4428.88 - 4433.48] subgroups that they can't find they just
[4430.64 - 4436.32] sodium is not all sodium and research
[4433.48 - 4439.00] science hasn't put you know hasn't put
[4436.32 - 4443.00] 50 million 100 million $200 million into
[4439.00 - 4444.68] into analyzing celery or celery juice um
[4443.00 - 4446.08] it hasn't done that it'll just keep on
[4444.68 - 4448.20] putting those hundreds of millions into
[4446.08 - 4450.36] jeans because jeans are great because
[4448.20 - 4452.36] they're so interesting as heck everybody
[4450.36 - 4454.56] believes in them and it's incredible to
[4452.36 - 4456.32] use as a blame game for everybody it's
[4454.56 - 4458.04] your fault your jeans are bad that's why
[4456.32 - 4460.04] you got thyroid problems it's your jeans
[4458.04 - 4461.76] it's always jeans jeans jeans jeans just
[4460.04 - 4463.48] never fall for that it's one of the
[4461.76 - 4466.12] great mistakes that wrote and thyroid he
[4463.48 - 4467.32] you can read about that one and then I
[4466.12 - 4468.76] think you're going to really like that
[4467.32 - 4470.24] when you read that one you'll be like
[4468.76 - 4471.60] okay now it makes sense more than I
[4470.24 - 4475.68] could just tell you right now in our
[4471.60 - 4478.48] time frame but but they're not going to
[4475.68 - 4480.20] put $100 million into celery it's not
[4478.48 - 4482.76] going to happen or a billion dollars
[4480.20 - 4485.32] into celery and celery has all these
[4482.76 - 4487.64] different subgroups of salts entirely
[4485.32 - 4489.80] different undiscovered entirely
[4487.64 - 4491.32] different those are the subgroups that
[4489.80 - 4493.84] actually rebuild the seven blend to
[4491.32 - 4495.20] rebuild your hydrochloric acid so yeah
[4493.84 - 4498.72] do I sound like a broken record do your
[4495.20 - 4500.52] celery juice I probably do but also I
[4498.72 - 4502.72] find that people forget to do it anyway
[4500.52 - 4507.52] so it's good I keep on telling tell
[4502.72 - 4511.00] saying it you know
[4507.52 - 4512.96] so okay so um do 4 ounces of celery
[4511.00 - 4514.96] juice get the big stalks throw it
[4512.96 - 4516.56] through a juicer go to a juice place
[4514.96 - 4518.52] just get straight celery if you can't
[4516.56 - 4519.84] stand it put a little apple in it if you
[4518.52 - 4521.68] can't stand straight celery put a
[4519.84 - 4523.80] cucumber in it I I'll deal with that I
[4521.68 - 4525.40] could live with that but the more juice
[4523.80 - 4527.76] the better your hydrochloric acid builds
[4525.40 - 4530.00] up and you find a lot of your symptoms
[4527.76 - 4532.48] can go away because once your
[4530.00 - 4535.24] hydrochloric acid is build up your liver
[4532.48 - 4537.08] gets a little stronger your liver which
[4535.24 - 4539.88] is behind so many different gut health
[4537.08 - 4542.80] symptoms and other symptoms once your
[4539.88 - 4547.00] hydrochloric acid gets built up
[4542.80 - 4549.08] stronger then protein doesn't rot and
[4547.00 - 4551.64] that means whether you're a vegetarian
[4549.08 - 4554.08] and you're eating soy protein I don't
[4551.64 - 4555.56] really like soy protein let but I
[4554.08 - 4558.48] understand if that's all you got is some
[4555.56 - 4560.40] tofu I totally get it but or you're a
[4558.48 - 4562.88] vean that's eating tons and tons of nuts
[4560.40 - 4566.08] to try to get protein and nut Butters or
[4562.88 - 4569.04] you're an you know a a whatever an
[4566.08 - 4571.72] animal protein lover that you know loves
[4569.04 - 4572.84] the high protein animal diet and no carb
[4571.72 - 4575.24] diet and that's what you love or
[4572.84 - 4578.00] something and you're doing lots of meat
[4575.24 - 4581.48] and chicken and pork or whatever lamb or
[4578.00 - 4583.44] whatever you're doing and eggs you know
[4581.48 - 4585.64] the point is is you want that stuff to
[4583.44 - 4588.60] break down better so it doesn't rot and
[4585.64 - 4592.76] purify as it goes through the gut don't
[4588.60 - 4596.36] do eggs eggs feed every bug in the
[4592.76 - 4599.56] body and uh they just do I I I can't say
[4596.36 - 4600.88] it enough eggs create so many gut health
[4599.56 - 4604.32] problems I want to talk about this part
[4600.88 - 4606.60] about gut health too by the way um with
[4604.32 - 4608.12] regarding to to how gut the gut health
[4606.60 - 4610.08] works with so many people with different
[4608.12 - 4612.44] symptoms many people feel like they
[4610.08 - 4614.28] can't digest anything and you you might
[4612.44 - 4618.24] be one of them right you might be one of
[4614.28 - 4619.92] them and um and you'll feel like you
[4618.24 - 4622.52] can't digest but there's some things you
[4619.92 - 4625.72] feel you can eat that you digest fine
[4622.52 - 4627.96] it's not that you're digesting it fine
[4625.72 - 4630.32] it's just that you don't feel it touch
[4627.96 - 4632.64] nerves the nerves in the intestinal
[4630.32 - 4634.04] tract sometimes get so IR irritable and
[4632.64 - 4637.36] irritated especially if you have a lot
[4634.04 - 4639.68] of neurotoxins if Epstein bar is inside
[4637.36 - 4643.24] the liver or in the body or even inside
[4639.68 - 4644.96] the thyroid which by the way um I
[4643.24 - 4647.64] brought to the table for the first time
[4644.96 - 4649.28] in history sepin bar sits inside is is
[4647.64 - 4651.04] is the thyroid problem you're going to
[4649.28 - 4653.20] read about it more in thyroid healing
[4651.04 - 4657.56] than I even did in book one medical
[4653.20 - 4659.16] medium um of course and and what happens
[4657.56 - 4661.68] is if you got the Epstein bar in the
[4659.16 - 4664.72] liver and it's feeding off of pollutants
[4661.68 - 4667.92] solvents garbage poisons
[4664.72 - 4671.12] toxins it's then releasing those poisons
[4667.92 - 4673.68] and toxins into into your body okay into
[4671.12 - 4676.20] your bloodstream into your blood stream
[4673.68 - 4680.04] they get into the intestinal tract they
[4676.20 - 4681.92] get into the bladder they cause nerve
[4680.04 - 4684.20] sensitivities which can give you a sense
[4681.92 - 4687.52] of citis too in your in your
[4684.20 - 4690.00] bladder um they can these toxins build
[4687.52 - 4691.96] up they get in the intestinal Linings
[4690.00 - 4694.64] and they hit all the little nerves and
[4691.96 - 4697.40] they make them sensitive you eat
[4694.64 - 4699.56] something like you chew a celery stick
[4697.40 - 4701.32] you feel like you won't digest it you
[4699.56 - 4703.68] chew a cucumber you feel like you're not
[4701.32 - 4705.44] going to digest anything you eat
[4703.68 - 4707.40] something like some lettuce you're going
[4705.44 - 4709.28] to feel like it hurts it doesn't digest
[4707.40 - 4711.24] anything cuz what it's doing is it's
[4709.28 - 4712.84] touching the Linings as it's going
[4711.24 - 4715.40] through the intestinal tract and it's
[4712.84 - 4718.76] hitting every single hot nerve along the
[4715.40 - 4720.60] way including fruits that have berries
[4718.76 - 4723.60] and berries that have seeds and so forth
[4720.60 - 4727.36] it just it hits line hits the
[4723.60 - 4729.96] lining and you may feel though that when
[4727.36 - 4732.04] you eat an egg you feel like you
[4729.96 - 4734.16] digested it perfectly and I understand
[4732.04 - 4736.60] that if it feels good then I get it but
[4734.16 - 4738.76] the reason why eggs don't touch the
[4736.60 - 4742.16] Linings of the intestinal tract and the
[4738.76 - 4743.84] colon they don't touch the Linings they
[4742.16 - 4746.24] actually sit in the middle as like a
[4743.84 - 4749.24] glue that just goes through it doesn't
[4746.24 - 4751.24] trigger off nerves cuz it's not touching
[4749.24 - 4754.12] anything that's why so many people are
[4751.24 - 4756.16] like I can eat an egg but if I eat an
[4754.12 - 4758.72] egg on some lettuce it's the lettuce I
[4756.16 - 4761.60] can't digest the lettuce you're you can
[4758.72 - 4763.96] digest the lettuce it's just that it
[4761.60 - 4765.88] hurts if you have those one of the if
[4763.96 - 4769.36] you're one of those people with a really
[4765.88 - 4771.88] really really hyp sensitive gut issue
[4769.36 - 4774.44] hyper sensitive intestinal track issue
[4771.88 - 4776.92] it's going to
[4774.44 - 4779.12] hurt they have to think you have to you
[4776.92 - 4782.40] have to know that that that's why it's
[4779.12 - 4784.52] doing it now avocado I noticed though I
[4782.40 - 4787.56] can get avocado in people sometimes some
[4784.52 - 4789.96] banana if it's ripe in the right way not
[4787.56 - 4792.40] fully rip not too ripe overripe and not
[4789.96 - 4795.44] under rpe and you know things like
[4792.40 - 4796.84] winter squash can be a lot smoother for
[4795.44 - 4798.36] people that are in that condition
[4796.84 - 4800.92] they're really sensitive sometimes
[4798.36 - 4802.32] potatoes can and avocados can there's
[4800.92 - 4803.72] you know there's different foods
[4802.32 - 4805.72] steaming vegetables till they're
[4803.72 - 4807.60] literally they fall through a fork the
[4805.72 - 4810.32] fork falls through it can also you know
[4807.60 - 4812.00] kind of help but I get it and if you eat
[4810.32 - 4813.24] too many things raw and crunchy and all
[4812.00 - 4815.52] that it's going to touch it all but it
[4813.24 - 4817.84] doesn't mean you're not digesting it
[4815.52 - 4820.40] doesn't mean you're not digesting it but
[4817.84 - 4821.92] when you drink the celery juice and the
[4820.40 - 4824.56] cucumber juice you could do cucumber
[4821.92 - 4826.76] juice too you it's like soothing it
[4824.56 - 4828.20] starts to heal those Linings and heal
[4826.76 - 4829.88] heal those nerves by getting rid of
[4828.20 - 4831.88] those Epstein bar poisons out of the
[4829.88 - 4833.24] liver and out of the intestinal lining
[4831.88 - 4835.12] which eventually will make you less
[4833.24 - 4837.92] sensitive on the
[4835.12 - 4840.28] nerves so that's important what not to
[4837.92 - 4844.68] eat don't eat dairy don't eat milk
[4840.28 - 4846.32] cheese butter kefir yogurt if you can if
[4844.68 - 4847.88] you have sibo if you have a gut problem
[4846.32 - 4849.84] if you have Celiac if you have anything
[4847.88 - 4851.96] going on with intestinal problems and
[4849.84 - 4854.48] you might be like oh I already know that
[4851.96 - 4857.52] I'm on this do diet this big diet it's a
[4854.48 - 4859.16] low it's a low carb high protein diet
[4857.52 - 4862.00] they already got that
[4859.16 - 4863.64] down but did they have it down 35 years
[4862.00 - 4865.64] ago when I was telling people no they
[4863.64 - 4869.40] didn't trust me they
[4865.64 - 4872.36] didn't and not only that it might have
[4869.40 - 4874.76] that part down but you don't want to be
[4872.36 - 4876.80] on high high protein which is high fat
[4874.76 - 4879.12] ends up being high fat you don't want to
[4876.80 - 4881.16] be on that with any kind of intestinal
[4879.12 - 4884.04] tract problems even if some of your
[4881.16 - 4886.68] symptoms AR rested you can still get the
[4884.04 - 4888.52] putrification the sluggish liver and the
[4886.68 - 4890.68] liver can get more sluggish over time
[4888.52 - 4892.36] set you up for more type 2 diabetes like
[4890.68 - 4894.56] pre-diabetes and blood sugar problems
[4892.36 - 4896.28] down the road when you're older you want
[4894.56 - 4897.56] to get more fruits and vegetables and
[4896.28 - 4898.76] which is the next thing I want to talk
[4897.56 - 4900.20] about is getting more fruits and
[4898.76 - 4902.96] vegetables
[4900.20 - 4905.40] in you want you can't be afraid of fruit
[4902.96 - 4907.16] when it comes down to gut health so one
[4905.40 - 4908.92] thing where I always get stoned where
[4907.16 - 4911.72] people meaning they try to Stone me to
[4908.92 - 4914.40] death over and and throw Rotten Tomatoes
[4911.72 - 4916.64] at me and throw you know and throw
[4914.40 - 4919.12] sticks and they get the pitchforks and
[4916.64 - 4920.88] the shovels and the Torches and they
[4919.12 - 4923.56] just you know and they chant and they
[4920.88 - 4925.28] get angry because there's so much fruit
[4923.56 - 4926.88] fear that developed and I've said this
[4925.28 - 4929.84] before I'll have to say it again it only
[4926.88 - 4932.08] started from one guy one guy that's
[4929.84 - 4933.84] popular in natural alternative medicine
[4932.08 - 4936.36] that didn't like
[4933.84 - 4938.08] fruit he but he what he did like though
[4936.36 - 4940.08] is to sell it he liked to sell it
[4938.08 - 4942.72] packaged in little capsules so he can
[4940.08 - 4944.28] make a ton of money off of everybody so
[4942.72 - 4947.08] they wanted to dominate that market so
[4944.28 - 4949.44] he didn't want people eating fruit but
[4947.08 - 4951.16] he wanted them to buy their little you
[4949.44 - 4953.08] know fruit capsules are little
[4951.16 - 4955.60] antioxidant special little fruit
[4953.08 - 4959.04] capsules to make some
[4955.60 - 4961.52] cashola so so you know but spread the
[4959.04 - 4963.28] word into basically a few different
[4961.52 - 4965.48] modalities of medicine spread the world
[4963.28 - 4969.24] in word in you know Oriental medicine
[4965.48 - 4971.12] which I love spread the world word in um
[4969.24 - 4972.60] um you know Eastern medicine different
[4971.12 - 4974.80] varieties of Eastern medicine spread the
[4972.60 - 4977.20] the word in acupuncture it's you know
[4974.80 - 4979.16] you know that that variety of all
[4977.20 - 4981.24] because Oriental medicine isn't just
[4979.16 - 4983.64] acupuncture there's different there's
[4981.24 - 4985.68] different like sectors of of Oriental
[4983.64 - 4987.08] medicine it's got spread into that whole
[4985.68 - 4988.84] area then it got spread into also
[4987.08 - 4991.88] alternative Western
[4988.84 - 4995.24] medicine um and it just it just got in
[4991.88 - 4998.20] there like a virus stay away from fruit
[4995.24 - 5000.96] causes problem causes harms causes harm
[4998.20 - 5003.60] causes this causes cancer it's bad it's
[5000.96 - 5005.24] sugar it's bad but what fruit does is it
[5003.60 - 5007.36] clears out strepa cacus out of the
[5005.24 - 5009.76] intestinal tract it can't feed strep it
[5007.36 - 5011.64] clears out bad funguses not candida
[5009.76 - 5013.88] candida lowers because of fruit yeah it
[5011.64 - 5016.80] lowers because it's it's there's no need
[5013.88 - 5018.32] for candida to raise and eat garbage
[5016.80 - 5020.12] because there is no garbage fruit is a
[5018.32 - 5022.64] natural healing
[5020.12 - 5024.12] food so don't be afraid of fruit eat
[5022.64 - 5026.72] more berries if berries are the only
[5024.12 - 5029.20] thing you can eat eat more
[5026.72 - 5031.12] berries one of the greatest healing
[5029.20 - 5032.80] foods of all time for the intestinal
[5031.12 - 5034.48] tract is the banana I'm going to be
[5032.80 - 5036.40] straightforward another one of the
[5034.48 - 5040.24] greatest foods all time of healing the
[5036.40 - 5042.76] intestinal tract is is
[5040.24 - 5046.40] papaya is
[5042.76 - 5048.28] papaya two amazing Foods I've seen
[5046.40 - 5050.84] people with the worst conditions in
[5048.28 - 5052.40] testinal tract conditions eating papaya
[5050.84 - 5054.12] and banana blending it together and
[5052.40 - 5056.60] recovering from the most catastrophic
[5054.12 - 5058.44] Crohn's catastrophic colitis other
[5056.60 - 5060.60] health conditions that were um that were
[5058.44 - 5062.00] intestinal tract and recovered meanwhile
[5060.60 - 5064.76] they couldn't recover from just doing
[5062.00 - 5065.92] eggs or proteins are just proteins and
[5064.76 - 5068.36] no
[5065.92 - 5069.72] carbs I've seen this over and over again
[5068.36 - 5072.36] over the
[5069.72 - 5073.52] years sure sure if you're really healthy
[5072.36 - 5075.08] and you're just gaining a little weight
[5073.52 - 5077.00] and you want to go on a high protein
[5075.08 - 5079.20] diet low carb diet you want to exercise
[5077.00 - 5080.44] two hours every day and you want to do
[5079.20 - 5081.92] that and lose some weight and feel
[5080.44 - 5085.12] better there's nothing wrong with that I
[5081.92 - 5086.72] support it fine but remember your liver
[5085.12 - 5088.60] still will need what it's going to need
[5086.72 - 5090.76] so you don't get problems down the road
[5088.60 - 5092.52] if you're somebody dealing with a health
[5090.76 - 5093.72] condition that's gut related now you
[5092.52 - 5095.96] want to incorporate a little bit more
[5093.72 - 5098.56] fruit fruit but you can't put fruit on
[5095.96 - 5101.20] top of a steak you can't put fruit on
[5098.56 - 5104.68] top of a pile of nuts you can't put
[5101.20 - 5107.52] fruit on top of a whole bunch of
[5104.68 - 5110.32] tofu you you just got to you got to know
[5107.52 - 5112.24] you know you got to know how to how to
[5110.32 - 5114.28] do it you got to know how to do it so
[5112.24 - 5115.64] you bring it in and if you are still
[5114.28 - 5117.24] eating animal protein you have the
[5115.64 - 5118.88] animal protein at the end of the day
[5117.24 - 5120.00] maybe your last meal of the day so this
[5118.88 - 5121.96] way you can do a little bit of a
[5120.00 - 5123.52] smoothie in the morning maybe a smoothie
[5121.96 - 5125.76] in the
[5123.52 - 5128.56] afternoon um that's
[5125.76 - 5131.00] important so you know you can totally do
[5128.56 - 5132.72] anything like that gut health smoothies
[5131.00 - 5136.04] I like the heavy metal detox smoothie
[5132.72 - 5137.96] but any kind of smoothie banana
[5136.04 - 5139.92] papaya you don't have to do green
[5137.96 - 5141.52] smoothies if you don't want to if you
[5139.92 - 5143.56] have a sensitive gut issue totally
[5141.52 - 5145.04] sensitive gut gut issue completely like
[5143.56 - 5146.60] you're just hyper sensitive and you
[5145.04 - 5148.64] don't want to put a whole bunch of
[5146.60 - 5151.28] greens inside of a
[5148.64 - 5154.96] blender or some kind of fancy blendering
[5151.28 - 5157.12] machine um I understand um just do
[5154.96 - 5161.04] something gentle do maybe a little bit
[5157.12 - 5163.84] of barleygrass juice powder do that in
[5161.04 - 5165.68] papaya uh and banana a blender of papaya
[5163.84 - 5168.80] and banana and just try to sip a little
[5165.68 - 5172.36] of it get a little bit of this in you
[5168.80 - 5173.40] um so that's that's you know that's okay
[5172.36 - 5174.60] you know there's different things to
[5173.40 - 5176.08] bring different ways to bring in a
[5174.60 - 5177.92] little bit more fruit into the diet with
[5176.08 - 5182.48] the gut health
[5177.92 - 5185.80] issues but realize too that what you eat
[5182.48 - 5187.56] may not affect your gut until days later
[5185.80 - 5189.52] you may eat something and not realize
[5187.56 - 5191.32] it's a causing a problem three days
[5189.52 - 5194.28] later there's a delayed effect and then
[5191.32 - 5196.52] whatever you ate that moment you thought
[5194.28 - 5198.88] was the problem like for instance you
[5196.52 - 5201.60] can eat a piece of fruit but if you
[5198.88 - 5203.20] actually have something in you that's
[5201.60 - 5205.52] moving through you and it finally gets
[5203.20 - 5207.92] to that sensitive spot down there by the
[5205.52 - 5210.04] ilocal valve and it gets to that second
[5207.92 - 5211.80] sensitive spot down there and then it
[5210.04 - 5213.36] hits that inflamed spot right when
[5211.80 - 5215.52] you're eating an apple and the Apple
[5213.36 - 5217.00] never even got down past the dadum yet
[5215.52 - 5219.60] it never even got down out of your
[5217.00 - 5221.60] stomach yet but yet the timing was right
[5219.60 - 5224.60] where peristaltic action because you
[5221.60 - 5226.88] were just eating per peristaltic action
[5224.60 - 5229.36] just squeezed finally some food that you
[5226.88 - 5231.40] had two days ago right down to your yo
[5229.36 - 5233.44] sequel you're going to blame the
[5231.40 - 5237.28] Apple that's another confusion that
[5233.44 - 5239.28] happens all the time all the time so
[5237.28 - 5240.92] then but you'll still eat that bad food
[5239.28 - 5242.48] that you ate 3 days ago because you
[5240.92 - 5244.36] don't think it caused a problem because
[5242.48 - 5247.04] it it didn't get to that part in your
[5244.36 - 5250.36] intestinal tract to cause that
[5247.04 - 5251.92] problem yet that's another thing to be
[5250.36 - 5254.28] concerned
[5251.92 - 5255.68] about probiotics that's a big thing
[5254.28 - 5257.72] everybody worries about and everything I
[5255.68 - 5259.60] would try to grow something one time a
[5257.72 - 5261.92] year any time a year whatever you can do
[5259.60 - 5263.60] grow anything grow it in a pot inside
[5261.92 - 5265.56] grow Sprouts because you get those
[5263.60 - 5268.80] elevated biotics that nobody knows about
[5265.56 - 5270.68] it's still a secret I put it in book one
[5268.80 - 5272.40] I talked about it before in radio shows
[5270.68 - 5275.52] and nobody still knows about it out
[5272.40 - 5278.32] there it breaks my heart elevated
[5275.52 - 5281.72] biotics is not a microorganism that's in
[5278.32 - 5284.84] dirt okay those are weak they need to
[5281.72 - 5287.12] hide in dirt elevated biotics sit on the
[5284.84 - 5289.12] leaf they sit on the leaf like in the
[5287.12 - 5290.48] garden they sit on the Tomato in the
[5289.12 - 5292.36] garden they sit on things in the garden
[5290.48 - 5294.48] they sit on an apple on the Apple Tree
[5292.36 - 5296.16] they sit go to the Farm's market and
[5294.48 - 5297.72] just get you know some organic apples
[5296.16 - 5299.84] and I guarantee you they'll have the
[5297.72 - 5302.88] elevated probiotics I mean not probiotic
[5299.84 - 5304.64] the elevated biotic right on top of it
[5302.88 - 5307.24] and you get that elevated biotic and
[5304.64 - 5308.88] that produces B12 inside your intestinal
[5307.24 - 5310.76] tract that's the elevated biotic that
[5308.88 - 5313.52] saves your life you even have some of it
[5310.76 - 5316.88] in you in your in your
[5313.52 - 5318.20] elium you even have some in your alium
[5316.88 - 5320.36] that you might have gotten from a
[5318.20 - 5323.52] raspberry you picked walking on a trail
[5320.36 - 5324.52] 20 years ago way better than probiotics
[5323.52 - 5326.04] can ever
[5324.52 - 5328.20] be
[5326.04 - 5330.40] so that's something you want to do in
[5328.20 - 5332.72] your life you want to try to get out
[5330.40 - 5334.24] pick a few berries go to an organic farm
[5332.72 - 5336.12] that lets you go out there and you're
[5334.24 - 5337.72] picking your pint of strawberries right
[5336.12 - 5340.32] there and you eat one strawberry or
[5337.72 - 5342.48] whatever it is do it next year if you
[5340.32 - 5345.28] missed it this year maybe blueberry
[5342.48 - 5347.32] season's out right now and you can go to
[5345.28 - 5350.52] a a farm somewhere but you know it's
[5347.32 - 5351.92] it's whatever you you can do like that
[5350.52 - 5354.28] grow something in your garden grow
[5351.92 - 5356.20] Sprouts inside the house grow some
[5354.28 - 5359.36] different Sprouts fenig Greek sprouts
[5356.20 - 5361.16] red clover Sprouts um you know grow you
[5359.36 - 5364.80] know a little bit broccoli Sprouts kale
[5361.16 - 5367.04] sprouts kale routs are amazing um pees
[5364.80 - 5370.20] they'll have the the
[5367.04 - 5373.12] bacteria these microorganisms that are
[5370.20 - 5374.60] unstoppable they bypass the stomach
[5373.12 - 5376.28] hydrochloric acid even no matter what
[5374.60 - 5378.72] kind of hydrochloric acid you got built
[5376.28 - 5381.36] all seven blend up the par it can't kill
[5378.72 - 5383.32] these microorganisms and they go down
[5381.36 - 5385.96] deep into the gut and they get our
[5383.32 - 5388.24] health back in our gut kale Farmers
[5385.96 - 5391.00] Market kale will have so much of this
[5388.24 - 5393.32] this this microorganism on the leaf if
[5391.00 - 5396.20] you eat one piece of this kale you can
[5393.32 - 5398.52] help restore your gut to get it back to
[5396.20 - 5402.48] where you need to start start stomping
[5398.52 - 5404.52] on um stacus stomping on eoli stomping
[5402.48 - 5406.16] on viruses inside the gut I mean
[5404.52 - 5409.88] honestly that is one of the most
[5406.16 - 5411.80] powerful secrets of all time that Spirit
[5409.88 - 5417.32] blessed me
[5411.80 - 5419.28] with so I can tell you and it's that
[5417.32 - 5421.88] elevated biotic that's a
[5419.28 - 5424.40] lifesaver and it saturates the intested
[5421.88 - 5425.80] inal Linings and it sits in the Elum
[5424.40 - 5429.12] where where it loves to stay cuz that's
[5425.80 - 5430.64] where it loves to go and camp out mostly
[5429.12 - 5432.64] but it goes all through the intestinal
[5430.64 - 5434.40] tract sits in the helium and it creates
[5432.64 - 5436.92] B12 the kind of B12 that stops
[5434.40 - 5438.80] methylation problems methylation
[5436.92 - 5440.32] problems are caused by Epstein bar
[5438.80 - 5441.72] they're caused by Epstein bar creating
[5440.32 - 5444.88] tons of toxins setting off the
[5441.72 - 5447.36] methylation G mutation test how do I
[5444.88 - 5449.00] know Spirit told me how do I have proof
[5447.36 - 5451.40] because I can get people to reverse that
[5449.00 - 5453.24] Gene by getting rid of their Epstein bar
[5451.40 - 5454.72] and getting their toxins down so when
[5453.24 - 5456.80] they get the test the doctor's like oh
[5454.72 - 5458.36] wait a minute you you don't have a gene
[5456.80 - 5461.24] mutation what happened what happened
[5458.36 - 5464.84] what you never did to begin with you
[5461.24 - 5466.12] never did to begin with so methylation
[5464.84 - 5468.20] has a lot to do with these elevated
[5466.12 - 5469.48] biotics on those kinds of foods so
[5468.20 - 5471.96] that's another secret to getting
[5469.48 - 5473.92] yourself better I've seen people do it
[5471.96 - 5476.36] over and over again all since I was a
[5473.92 - 5479.32] child all the way to
[5476.36 - 5482.32] now back years and years and years ago
[5479.32 - 5483.80] you walk into a pharmacy
[5482.32 - 5486.64] and you say you got a probiotic they
[5483.80 - 5488.56] wouldn't even know what one
[5486.64 - 5492.16] was
[5488.56 - 5494.12] and even even funnier than that tell
[5492.16 - 5498.28] them about elevated biotics on top of a
[5494.12 - 5501.56] Leafa kale that look like you're
[5498.28 - 5503.88] insane you know the thing is is uh I

[5667.72 - 5671.40] anti-inflammatory for the intestinal
[5669.24 - 5673.56] tract because it squatches down some of
[5671.40 - 5675.12] the bacteria it's also has alkaloids
[5673.56 - 5677.16] that are anti-inflammatory so nettle
[5675.12 - 5681.00] leaf tea lemon bomb tea kills off strep
[5677.16 - 5684.28] ausy coli C diff staff and even fste bar
[5681.00 - 5686.32] virus lemon balb te for the intestinal
[5684.28 - 5687.92] tract that's fine one more thing I think

[5687.92 - 5691.44] all the cleansings all on the intestinal
[5690.00 - 5693.28] tract cleansings that are out there CLE
[5691.44 - 5695.52] cleansers and cleansing programs and
[5693.28 - 5697.32] everything else be cautious even if one
[5695.52 - 5699.44] did you pretty good don't keep on doing
[5697.32 - 5702.08] it over and over again just try to eat
[5699.44 - 5703.76] more leafy greens try to get more leafy
[5702.08 - 5706.12] greens and more fruits in your diet over
[5703.76 - 5708.76] time it'll do more than than a 30-day
[5706.12 - 5712.00] cleanse because the 30-day cleanses put
[5708.76 - 5713.76] your adrenals under arrest they put they
[5712.00 - 5715.68] put dur rest or they put them under
[5713.76 - 5717.48] stress I mean they put the adrenals
[5715.68 - 5719.08] under stress they put the LI this liver
[5717.48 - 5721.04] does not like to be cleansed and purged
[5719.08 - 5723.04] and pushed like that so it puts the
[5721.04 - 5726.08] liver on under massive stress it puts
[5723.04 - 5727.80] the kidneys under massive stress it puts
[5726.08 - 5729.48] all those different programs I don't
