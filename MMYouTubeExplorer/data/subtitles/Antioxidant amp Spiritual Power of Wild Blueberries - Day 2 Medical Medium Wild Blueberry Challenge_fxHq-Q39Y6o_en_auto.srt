120
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,360

now I never drink I was never interested

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,680
at all in it plus I had SOC in my ear

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,120
telling me not to drink and not to try

127
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,740
it when I was younger so I adhered by

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,620
soc's information

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,100

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,880
years old they find some old wine

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,960
somewhere and they're like it's been

147
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,340
just sitting down in the ground

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,380
somewhere

149
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,000
and it's like a bunch of a bunch of

150
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,500
people come out of the woodwork that

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,300
have millions and billions of dollars

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,060

yeah okay so let's talk about what we're

158
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,539
doing today we're talking about the

159
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,460
spiritual power of the wild Bluebird we

160
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,020
talked about the antioxidants too which

161
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,080
is also something that's really exciting

162
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,960
to me and

163
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,900
um you know the thing is is that this is

164
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,580
a food we are so blessed and lucky to

165
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,759
have here on Earth

166
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,500
like this is a resource

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:44,880
that we are blessed like we should be so

168
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,759
grateful to have this resource in our

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,580
hands right now okay I talked about

170
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,180
yesterday how wild blueberries the

171
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,100
species isn't just one think about that

172
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,340
right now if you look at a wild

173
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,340
Blueberry Field it's not one plant

174
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,880
species like others out there in the

175
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,259
world it's not one plant species and I'm

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,120
saying that over and over again because

177
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,720
this is huge

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,199
there are multiple plant species in that

179
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,080
field of wild blueberries but they all

180
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,139
kind of look the same right you just see

181
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,520
a sea of wild blueberries and of course

182
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,259
the berries are a little bit off in

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,300
different sizes and everything in the

184
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,419
field but either way

185
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,780
there are different species in that

186
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:37,020
field this is their survival method

187
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,780
it's a part of how they have survived

188
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,919
for thousands and thousands of years

189
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,220
which is incredible now here's another

190
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:47,160
thing too now this is part of like the

191
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,759
spiritual power that the wild blueberry

192
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,360
holds because you can't kill it now you

193
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,520
can kill every tree on the planet

194
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,860
and if you do

195
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,020
they won't come back

196
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:07,340
because you need a seed you need right

197
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,960
you need an acorn you have to reseed

198
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:13,380
those trees

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,479
a tree will not grow when it's been cut

200
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:18,180
and burned down

201
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,759
it can't come back an oak tree won't

202
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,660
come back a maple tree will not come

203
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,639
back

204
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:30,120
it has to be the seed to start another

205
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:33,180
maple tree a seed to start another oak

206
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,260
tree right and that's how it works

207
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,419
but you can burn the wild blueberry down

208
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,800
to the ground and it rises out of the

209
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,959
ashes

210
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,040
Like a Phoenix

211
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,740
it has spiritual Powers it can survive

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,860
the unsurvivable

213
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,740
that's the kind of food I want in my

214
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,839
body that's the kind of food people who

215
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,820
have been through hell and back need

216
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,860
inside their body

217
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,240
that's the kind of food people who have

218
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,320
been through chronic illness they've

219
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,300
been through sickness they've been

220
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,860
through strife and struggles they've

221
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,959
been through suffering they've been

222
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,700
through hardships and losses they've

223
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,580
been through mental abuse they've been

224
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,500
through mental you know power Downs what

225
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,899
that means is just being beaten down

226
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,899
mentally and everything else they've

227
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,839
been through hell and back

228
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:29,100
and the wild blueberry is for the people

229
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,839
who have been down there before right in

230
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,880
that place where you're on your hands

231
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,220
and knees you're praying to God you lost

232
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,779
a lot you struggled you're even if it's

233
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,060
something that's mild to somebody else

234
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,680
but it's really serious to you where

235
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,420
someone gets serious and whatever

236
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,800
because everybody has a different

237
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,779
challenge

238
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,600
and a different problem

239
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,920
and a different struggle and they're all

240
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,440
important

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,180
there's no you know like saying well

242
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,800
that's not important that is or that's

243
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,680
they're all important so whatever

244
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,600
anybody's ever been through

245
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,339
it's important to note the wild

246
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,560
blueberries for them if you're having

247
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,899

plant all on its own

259
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:35,339
that's plant medicine right there

260
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,899
it's not toxicity plant medicine where

261
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,899
you think you're doing plant medicine

262
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,120
and it's altering your mind in a toxic

263
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:44,820
way damaging nerve cells damaging

264
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,100
neurons you know like ayahuasca that's

265
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,899
not plant medicine that's just a toxic

266
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,360
plant right

267
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,360

268
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,680
substance right now I'm not I hope I

272
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,100
caffeine in them right

273
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,839
caffeine is toxic to the brain and I

274
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,279
talked about that many times over the

275
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,600

288
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,180
I just want to let everybody know that

289
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,279
these are incredible Bibles right here

290
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,339
with a tremendous amount of information

291
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,440
there's 12 books in these two books 12

292
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,120
books including 100 recipes and

293
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
everything else a recipe book everything

294
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,220
else too so

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,880
there's different plants out there for

296
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,920
instance like caffeinated plants

297
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,600
right caffeine is damaging to the

298
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,240
adrenals

299
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,040
so that's not plant medicine that's

300
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,260
plant toxicity

301
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,480
because it could damage the adrenals

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,820
people don't realize that

303
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,440
so when people do caffeine whether it's

304
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,880
green tea whether it's matcha tea

305
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,860
whether it's cacao whatever it is

306
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,420
whether it's coffee that's damaging

307
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,760
their adrenals

308
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,200
right so I mean if you're into that just

309
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,579
don't get mad at me don't shoot the

310
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,620
messenger I'm just telling you what

311
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,700
damages and destroys your adrenal glands

312
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,300
right

313
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,700
so what happens is that there's plant

314
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,640
medicine that doesn't damage your

315
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,040
adrenals or your neurons or your brain

316
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,519
it's a spiritual based plant medicine

317
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,860
that does the opposite it's critical for

318
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,420
Focus concentration it's critical to get

319
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,459
the anthocyanins to the brain it's

320
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,560
critical for your spiritual growth so

321
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,260
there's plant medicine

322
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,779
that rises above

323
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,860
anything like toxicity out there

324
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:01,200
toxicity plant fake plant medicine

325
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,760
so there's plant medicine that super

326
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,880
seeds

327
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,800
other plants out there for us and our

328
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,980
brain and our health

329
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,320
so that's where the wild blueberry

330
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,639
comes in that's how incredible if you

331
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,160
guys want to know if you just came on

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,019
here 10 off you guys know I work with

333
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,060
Wyman's I told you guys

334
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,800
fully endorse them because I don't want

335
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,600
this to go away I want to give as much

336
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,700
support I want to tell as many people as

337
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,620
possible I want people to order this

338
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,100
someday so they can get it into their

339
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,880
body and have that inside of them and I

340
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,519
want Wyman's to keep on making this kind

341
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,079
of resource it's unbelievable they take

342
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,959
the berries out of the field they press

343
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,399
them it goes into the bottle and I want

344
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,200
to talk about stick around because I'm

345
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,779
going to talk about organic versus wild

346
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,820
food because people are confused and be

347
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:52,560
like oh it's not organic but what they

348
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,540
don't understand

349
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,360
and this is important to know

350
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,959
when you have or I'm a pro-organic food

351
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,760
but I'm also aware that organic crops

352
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,399
are sprayed three times a week with

353
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,620
pollinator killers

354
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,420
organic food crops are sprayed three

355
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,380
times a week

356
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:16,200
with pollinator Killers nicotine

357
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,040
so don't give me that Holier you're

358
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,620
holier than now crap and how this is a

359
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,959
wild food and oh why isn't it organic so

360
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,060
I'm not going to use that I'm all about

361
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,220
organic don't give me that holier than

362
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,860
now about that because what happens

363
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,760
is people don't realize it that our

364
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,339
organic food is also laced

365
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,260
it's laced with nicotine

366
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,120
MSG

367
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,940
and other stuff

368
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,660
and what people realize is they have to

369
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,899
spray the crap out of organic food or

370
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,079
all the aphids come and rip it apart so

371
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,000
they're loaded with copper

372
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,459
copper in the spray

373
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,380
like the toxic copper and organic spray

374
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,260
and nicotine

375
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,920
so here we are so what I'm saying is

376
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:11,399
that's a wild food that rarely needs to

377
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,100
ever be sprayed because a wild food can

378
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,680
tend to itself and protect itself a wild

379
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,139
food actually protects itself

380
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,940
so what that means is rarely does it

381
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:23,579
ever get sprayed and Wyman's will not

382
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,100
use a pollinator killer

383
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:29,220
if they ever do need to spray they won't

384
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,519
use a pollinator killer what does that

385
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,160
mean why here's the difference

386
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:39,120
this wild food they won't kill their

387
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,760
bees organic crops they kill their bees

388
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,500
important to know right there so they

389
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,019
also test

390
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,300
and they get zero percent zero percent

391
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,320
in their tests of pesticides but guess

392
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:54,600
what your organic food companies

393
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,100
won't test to make sure you have zero

394
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,260
percent nicotine

395
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,720
and zero percent copper

396
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,820
from their sprays

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,699
so every time you see it and I see in

398
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,639
the comments that Holier the now stuff

399
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:10,500
like oh it's not organic medical medium

400
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,139
doesn't know what he's talking about

401
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,040
so let me just give you the 101 right

402
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,560
now

403
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,339
your organic crops get sprayed with

404
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,620
copper toxic copper and toxic nicotine

405
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,839
and he ends up killing all the bees and

406
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,660
the pollinators and they get sprayed

407
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,019
rapidly because organic crops can't take

408
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,880
care of itself it's too weak this is a

409
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,980
wild food and I eat organic food I'm

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,920
just telling you this is a wild food

411
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,040
they rarely ever have to spray anything

412
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,380
and if they do they refuse to use a

413
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,380
pollinator killer and they test it zero

414
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,259
percent pesticide residue and here's the

415
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:52,320
other thing the organic food companies

416
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:55,019
they're not testing to make sure you're

417
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,360
not getting nicotine and copper

418
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,420
remember that this is an important piece

419
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,920
of information and it's mind-blowing and

420
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,779
by the way Wyman's juice is coming to

421
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,819
Europe early next year and to other

422
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,980
parts of the world next year or a year

423
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,140
later so pretty cool

424
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,819
anyway that's really mind-blowing

425
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,860
information all on its own and it's

426
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,079
important to know by the way 10 off

427
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,459

I need this stuff to stick around in the

431
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,500
world because they need resources like

432
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,959
this because it's magical and spiritual

433
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,880
and powerful and I love knowing that

434
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,919

435
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,740

comment they were like I never heard you

492
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,740
lip smack before I've never heard you

493
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,500
lip smack after I had the extractor

494
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,220
yesterday and I was like

495
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,799
lip smack that's what I'm doing so good

496
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,440

all right oh wait

498
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,320
I want to address a comment that was

499
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:18,660
also mentioned too yesterday okay so the

500
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,340
comment was this aw you're confusing me

501
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,039
you said

502
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:27,900
that you can have the five ingredients

503
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:30,360
in your hmds at any time of day so how

504
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,200
is it possible you would ruin your

505
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,840
smoothie if you put in the wrong stuff

506
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,120
so what that was so that was just

507
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,000
misunderstood what I was saying was

508
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,880
don't put things that will ruin your

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,160
smoothie or your health don't put in the

510
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,260
chlorella the apple cider vinegar the

511
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,360
charcoal the collagen all these things

512
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,860
that are not good for us don't put

513
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,740
chocolate in there all these things that

514
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,200
should not be in there that do ruin what

515
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,700
it's trying to do for you because you're

516
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,919
adding all those things that actually

517
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,080
complicate the body of the liver put a

518
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,700
burden on you burden on a system and

519
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,900
burden on everything that you're trying

520
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,700

no one has a fear of healing that's

594
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,740

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,360

time you got uh you have a fear of

598

603
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,600

605
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,760
maybe you guys have heard that before

606
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,760
right

607
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:51,780
we want to heal we want to live forever

608
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,960
people want to live forever they do they

609
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:58,220
do we want to live at our healthiest for

610
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,220
as long as we can

611
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,659
there's also a trusting wire within us

612
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,220
that's been taken advantage of by

613
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:09,900
Industries

614
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,700
trust we have a trusting liar inside of

615
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,840
us

616
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,960
it's a trusting wire inside of the brain

617
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:21,000
and that trusting wire has been

618
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,659
manipulated and conditioned

619
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,820
for a long time by the industries

620
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,220
the trusting wire is built into the

621
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,620
neurons inside

622
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,679
the emotional centers of the brain and

623
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,960
that trusting wire is a real thing that

624
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,880
gets manipulated and the think tanks out

625
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,100
there in the industries love to actually

626
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,120
control that trusting wire that's inside

627
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,120
people's brains

628
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,140
okay this has created a brainwashing

629
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,840
within us

630
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,580
a mechanism inside us that wants

631
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,500
permission to do harmful things to

632
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:03,000
ourselves this is interesting right here

633
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,740
we want permission to harm ourselves

634
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,419
because once we get permission to harm

635
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,500
ourselves then we actually feel good

636
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:10,380
about it

637
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,539
and we can then do that

638
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,340
that's how it works

639
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,020
we want permission to eat as much

640
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,760
chocolate as we've ever wanted to eat

641
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,799
because oh it's good for us that's what

642
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,520
we're told we want permission to do what

643
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,159
we want we want permission to moderately

644
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,799
smoke we want permission

645
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,020
to smoke as much weed as we ever dreamed

646
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,120
we can smoke right I'm not no disrespect

647
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,059
any weed smokers because that's not what

648
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,760
this is about but we want permission

649
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:41,100
to do whatever we want to do

650
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,559
we do want that permission

651
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,539
to heart do harmful things to ourselves

652
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,700
the desire for health is so strong

653
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,380
inside of us that we'll try to look for

654
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,799
answers about why anything that's

655
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:56,820
harmful could be good for us

656
00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,140
we have this incredible desire

657
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:04,980
to want to find something

658
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:06,720
valuable in something that's harming us

659
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,940
it's really incredible

660
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,820
we want validation that hurting

661
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,480
ourselves is actually good for us

662
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,799
this can make it seem as if

663
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,440
self-sabotage is part of our innate

664
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,600
emotional nature that's mind-blowing as

665
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,460
if we want to harm ourselves when we

666
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,100
really don't we don't want to harm

667
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,779
ourselves but we're brainwashed

668
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,779
into thinking we do

669
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,279
we don't self-sabotage because we want

670
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,380
to make ourselves sick

671
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,100
we self-sabotage because we're taught to

672
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,100
self-sabotage

673
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,320
if someone is eating all this fast food

674
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,480
24 7. there's just there's always fast

675
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,299
food fast food it's a form of

676
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,700
self-sabotage to some degree right

677
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:55,260
but we're not doing it

678
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,679
purposely

679
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,720
right to harm ourselves if somebody

680
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,360
smokes if somebody smokes weed if

681
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,200
someone drinks if so I'll have another

682
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,200
sip right now

683
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:12,659
if someone drinks

684
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,000
they're not doing it to harm themselves

685
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:16,740
we self-sabotage because we're taught to

686
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,059
self-sabotage we're conditioned to

687
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,279
self-sabotage we're practically bred to

688
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:25,740
self-sabotage why am I even reading this

689
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,140
why am I even talking about this when

690
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,880
I'm doing a wild blueberry date you of

691
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,760
the challenge

692
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,340
because your spiritual powers in this

693
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,380
blue color right here that enters the

694
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,159
emotional centers of the brain that

695
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:44,240
helps to unwind brain washing from the

696
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:46,620
industries that is used to get us to

697
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,960
self-sabotage ourselves there's a

698
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,020
rewiring that happens when that blue

699
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,419
juice hits the brain our brain is like a

700
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,460
magnet to the blue anthocyanins coming

701
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,000
off these wild blueberries and going to

702
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,000
the brain

703
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,960
foreign

704
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,360
Cults and I call them Colts because

705
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,740
they're the Cults because they all speak

706
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,740
the same thing

707
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:17,039
that's how Cults work

708
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:19,860
they all say the same thing

709
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,080
no matter how you slice the pie

710
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,440
all the different Fabrics of alternative

711
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,279
medicine all still support and befriend

712
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,799
the same people the same thing

713
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,140
because it's one big cult

714
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,059
alternative medicine Cults as well as

715
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,700
top feeders and Bottom Feeders of the

716
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:41,760
health industry are always catering to

717
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,940
the self-sabotage brainwashing

718
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,460
they are they do you'll see it

719
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:51,480
you'll see every aspect of alternative

720
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:55,500
medicine doesn't want to insult

721
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,960
a particular group because they all are

722
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,140
basically working for each other and

723
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,720
around each other

724
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,000
trading within each other

725
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,700
working within each other and that's how

726
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,539
it is out there it's just a fact it's

727
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,539
just what it is

728
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,700
alternative medicine Cults as well as

729
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,559
top feeders and Bottom Feeders of the

730
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,960
health industry are always catering to

731
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,240
the self-sabotage brainwashing how how

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,980
ready

ever wanted because it's good for you

735
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,860

be like yeah green tea is totally fine

737
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,700

740
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,340
that's good oh a new study came out and

741
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,899
then another alternative Colt be like

742
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,240
green tea is good for you

743
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:48,240
and they'll all mimic the same thing oh

744
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,179
yeah you can have coffee do Organics uh

745
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,100
you know fair trade do organic coffee

746
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:55,440
yeah and you can you know it's all the

747
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,779
same thing oh you can do cacao all you

748
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,880
want oh yeah Ayahuasca is all right if

749
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,500
you do it you know once in a while and

750
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,899
you're having a spiritual moment and

751
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,120
you're with the right Shaman you can do

752
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:07,980
that too so all mimic the same thing and

753
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,440
all the Alternative Health Cults because

754
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,419
they all work together and they all

755
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,539
speak one language and that's when you

756
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:17,399
know it is one big cult right

757
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,220
I'm talking about this because the wild

758
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,640
blueberry helps us to break from that

759
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,340
it helps us to break away from that so

760
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,440
we have our own mind

761
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,600
the reason why medical medium

762
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,520
information is hated so much out there

763
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,679
because it gives person other person

764
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,480
their own free will back

765
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,580
it gives them their own free thinking

766
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,740
back their own free will it gives them

767
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,179
answers for the first time so they can

768
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,980
make decisions and choices for

769
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,899
themselves that's what it's been all

770
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,880
about for medical medium information it

771
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:50,279
gives the person freedom because when

772
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,779
you see it out there you're still all

773
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,059
wrapped up out there and all that other

774
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:56,100
cold stuff it's crazy how it works the

775
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:58,500
wild blueberry whether somebody knows it

776
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:02,539
or not when it's integrated into their

777
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,539
health can help them break from that

778
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,820
it's just mind-blowing information in

779
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,820
here

780
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,279
so let's just keep on reading I'm going

781
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,279
to have a little bit of wine real quick

782
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,799
it's not wine it's wild blueberry juice

783
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,600
if you just got here

784
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,760
that's the brain saver book I'm reading

785
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,760
out out there's two brain saver and the

786
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,039
Brain saver protocols

787
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,620
okay

788
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,700
so often using and here's another thing

789
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,980
too

790
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,779
the alternative medicine Cults will

791
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,120
often use their credentials to

792
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:37,620
manipulate our trust

793
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,659
there's nothing wrong with credentials I

794
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,419
have a lot of friends with credentials

795
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,299
a lot of doctor friends with credentials

796
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,860
right doctors that work for good not for

797
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,960
evil right

798
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,520
but a lot of people in the Cults out

799
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,279
there they use their credentials to

800
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,140
manipulate people and our trust they

801
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,659
create their own social media channels

802
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,000
and give their five tips in 15 minutes

803
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,460
and in those five tips you'll almost

804
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,460
always find at least one recommendation

805
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:08,100
that provides validation and reassurance

806
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:10,679
for self-sabotage

807
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,880
how freaking despicable when you think

808
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,919
about it

809
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,039
because every time I see those five tips

810
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:20,100
or ten tips or whatever it is you can

811
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,620
see in those 510 tips once again the

812
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,440
same language the same stuff to

813
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,960
self-sabotage is there

814
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,240
a big part of the self-sabotage

815
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,880
brainwashing is that we become

816
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,580
programmed to seek validation that doing

817
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,659
a harmful thing in moderation is

818
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,659
perfectly fine

819
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,320
exactly

820
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,519
Leah Collins says aw isn't here to be

821
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,159
liked or sugarcoat the truth he's here

822
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,799
to heal and break the false light in the

823
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,019
medical community and it's so truth so

824
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,720
that's so true in alternative medical

825
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:01,460
community and conventional

826
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,460
that's what's so crazy about it all

827
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,760
for The Not So Sick there's there these

828
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:10,440
self-sabotage measures are often a daily

829
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,240
part of everyone's life so here's how it

830
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,639
works what I mean by The Not So Sick you

831
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,639
guys you just got here today's day two

832
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,679
of the wild blueberry challenge I'm

833
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,419
making a couple of recipes we're having

834
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,859
some fun but I'm also talking about the

835
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:24,899
spiritual powers

836
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,940
any antioxidants of the wild blueberry

837
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:30,359
but I'm talking about it in association

838
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,359
with the emotional center of the brain

839
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,580
and how the wild blueberries

840
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,679
have the power to rise out of the ashes

841
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,099
allowing us to have the power to rise

842
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,020
out of mind control

843
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,639
because that's what's Happening Here on

844
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,560
planet Earth in the Alternative Health

845
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,919
movement is people are under mind

846
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,919
control

847
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,379
they're told their fish oil is fine

848
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,119
they're told their krill oil is fine

849
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:56,760
which it isn't you guys it's loaded with

850
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,400
Mercury but they don't realize it

851
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,740
they're told a lot of things I talk all

852
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,260
about it in the brain books but yeah

853
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:07,680
it's just unbelievable really The Not So

854
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,599
Sick what The Not So Sick is is look I

855
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,400
have respect for The Not So Sick the not

856
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,320
so sick of people that have symptoms but

857
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,540
it hasn't

858
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,980
impeded their life in such a way where

859
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,099
it robs the quality of their life where

860
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,960
they are in severe severe trouble

861
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:23,400
The Not So Sick are people that have a

862
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,660
couple of different symptoms and they

863
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,640
run around to different functional

864
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,079
doctors and regular doctors and they

865
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,520
just look for things to kind of keep

866
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,960
them floating and they float along

867
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,060
because they're not so sick and then

868
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,579
eventually the scale tips and they go

869
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,099
down the drain right

870
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,859
the not so sick

871
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,660
for The Not So Sick these self-sabotage

872
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,220
measures are often a daily part of

873
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,200
everybody's life get ready for this

874
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,359
coffee that's a daily part of

875
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,119
everybody's life who's not so sick

876
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,760
they could just still do coffee vinegar

877
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,859
that's another thing in their daily life

878
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,680
that's a self-sabotage

879
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:01,440
weapon right there is vinegar ages you

880
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,960
fast dissolves your teeth breaks your

881
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,339
immune system down breaks your nervous

882
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,920
system down

883
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:09,780
wine that's one right there

884
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,839
as long as you have a couple of glasses

885
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,000
on the weekend everything should be fine

886
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:16,740
yeah moderation

887
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,180
for that for The Not So Sick somebody

888
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,520
that just has like a thyroid problem

889
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,140
that they're managing or something

890
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,280
or they got some hot flashes or

891
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,660
something and they're just you know they

892
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,400
go to their doctors and they're like

893
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,839
whoa I whatever they can still drink

894
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,560
their wine on the weekends right they're

895
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,560
not so sick

896
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,640
so pizza that's another one The Not So

897
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,900
Sick can eat pizza all the time they

898
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,240
could have it on Friday nights they

899
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,280
could have it on Saturday night fried

900
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,800
and greasy food they can engage in that

901
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,960
too whether it's alternative fried and

902
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,820
greasy food whether it's vegan fried or

903
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,560
greasy food whether it's vegan pizza

904
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,900
they can still partake in it because

905
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,780
they're not so sick if we hear these are

906
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,420
not good for us we look for someone else

907
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:00,060
to say it is good for you in moderation

908
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,640
as long as it's vegan your pizza should

909
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,280
be fine in moderation because you're not

910
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,200
so sick yet so you can handle it as long

911
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,720
as you've got your wine once on the

912
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,180
weekend hey fine you can handle it

913
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,000
you're not so sick yet

914
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,280
we don't want to face the reality of

915
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,280
what we're really doing we don't want to

916
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,040
pay the consequences of osteopenia

917
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,079
coming from vinegar liver conditions

918
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,880
coming from alcohol adrenal problems

919
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,160
coming from caffeine like I was talking

920
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,140
about you guys so we'll never accept

921
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,599
that these are the true causes of these

922
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,300
conditions it's as if in Industry

923
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,940
conditioning has placed a robot inside

924
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,339
us that wants validation to slowly

925
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,320
destroy ourselves even though that's the

926
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:46,079
last thing we really want we want

927
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,420
validation for the industry

928
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,520
to keep on feeding us these things so we

929
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,200
can destroy ourselves we want validation

930
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,700
to destroy ourselves even though that's

931
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,520
not what we really want we've been

932
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,520
brainwashed to think that's what we want

933
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,839
we want to be healthy and strong and

934
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,160
live forever right I see that all the

935
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,200
time we want to be healthy and strong

936
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,940
and live forever under certain

937
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,980
conditions

938
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:13,200
some of these conditions are I'm going

939
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,460
to have my dark chocolate and coffee and

940
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,200
vinegar and wine and champagne and salt

941
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,820
I don't know what all this business is

942
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
about in this book

943
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,960
hmm I do perfectly fine in my wine

944
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,380
you can't stop me

945
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,740
I'm on page 95 you guys you can't stop

946
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,520
me you can't tell me I can't

947
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,220
and I'm about to go to page 96.

948
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,380
because I'll go and find someone who's a

949
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,420
health authority who says it's fine and

950
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,420
even good for me to eat all that plus

951
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,520
raw aged cheese and grass-fed butter and

952
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:54,540
green tea and matcha and Kombucha tea

953
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,820
and eggs and I'll run with that

954
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,680
we're taught to self-sabotage by the

955
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,079
industry

956
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,700
all those things are bad for us and if

957
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:04,560
you're not so sick you can play in that

958
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,660
game and keep on self-sabotaging and

959
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,880
keep on being taught to self-sabotage

960
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,380
but you're never free

961
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,440
you're

962
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,020
part of what they want

963
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,000
the industry and why am I saying this

964
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,859
again because the wild blueberry gets

965
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,500
into the consciousness of Consciousness

966
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,020
it gets into the soul it gets into the

967
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,240
physical brain and it starts to rewire

968
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,780
us the wild blueberry has the ability to

969
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:35,359
rewire us and to shed that brainwashing

970
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,359
it is the anti-brainwashing food

971
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:43,680
that will give me the comfy warm fuzzy

972
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,540
feeling inside that I've been validated

973
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,839
for doing these things that are actually

974
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:51,480
helping destroy my body

975
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,820
I'll even convince myself that my body

976
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,579
loves it my body loves chocolate so much

977
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,280
I crave it my body must love chocolate

978
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,280
my body loves vinegar I love it on

979
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,500
everything my body loves eggs I crave

980
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:08,420
them they're so good for me

981
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,420
my body likes all these things

982
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,220
and my body's fine with it and my body

983
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,079
needs it this brainwashing and

984
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,720
conditioning

985
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,000
becomes woven into the emotional centers

986
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,060
of our brain it also gets directed

987
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,800
mostly to women kind on purpose and

988
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,200
here's how it works

989
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,060
the systems in the industries brainwash

990
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,599
women kind

991
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:35,400
so that women kind believes they need

992
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,560
all these things that are actually

993
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,119
helping to destroy their body and if

994
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,980
they're not so sick they can keep on

995
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,020
partaking in it and the minute they get

996
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,540
too sick too sick no one's there to tell

997
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,760
them how to get out of it except medical

998
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:51,300
medium information which is that alone

999
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,859
is just crazy because why haven't the

1000
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,680
other alternative

1001
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:58,200
parts of the industries in the health

1002
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,760
industry figured all this out yet yeah

1003
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,380
they'll poach a little tidbit for

1004
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,060
medical medium here and there and you'll

1005
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,300
see somebody squeak it out once in a

1006
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:09,780
while but the alternative industry

1007
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,940
make sure it allows the not so sick

1008
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,099
people to keep on staying brainwashed

1009
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,680
and partake in all the products and

1010
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,599
guess what and on top of that the

1011
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,940
alternative industry sells it all to

1012
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,320
them

1013
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,000
sells women kind all the chocolate in

1014
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,220
the dark chocolate sells women kind all

1015
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,960
the matcha tea sells women kind all the

1016
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,280
Kombucha Tea which is really turns the

1017
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,280
blood into straight acid I've been

1018
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,079
saying that for 30 years sells all this

1019
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,300
stuff to women kind

1020
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,300
so women kind can slowly decline

1021
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,599
yet the emotional centers of our brain

1022
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,400
can only be pushed so far when you're

1023
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,079
sick or suffering enough physically

1024
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,820
mentally or emotionally a survival

1025
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,960
mechanism kicks into that happen to you

1026
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,060
guys

1027
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,619

did that ever happen to you guys where

1029
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,599
where literally something overrode the

1030
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:05,579
brainwashing and you said find medical

1031
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,560
meme information or an angel put medical

1032
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,900
meme information in front of you or

1033
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,000
something something happened and you

1034
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,160
guys felt it right when you're sick or

1035
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,800
suffering enough emotionally physically

1036
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,900
or anything mentally a survival

1037
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,119
mechanism kicks in did it kick in on you

1038
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,640
guys that survival mechanism did it hit

1039
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,980
a survival mechanism in your brain's

1040
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,740
emotional centers that has been inside

1041
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,839
of us since the beginning of time a

1042
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:34,400
survival mechanism beginning a time now

1043
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,400
check this out get ready for this

1044
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,740
these wild blueberries have been here

since the beginning of time

1046
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,380
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

1047
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,240
millions of years ago the wild blueberry

1048
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,339
has been here

1049
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,000
and there's been a mechanism built

1050
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:56,000
inside of us since the beginning of time

1051
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,619
that gets tripped up and we're finally

1052
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,960
done I'm done

1053
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:06,300
with the brainwashing

1054
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,400
I need answers

1055
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,400
I need to heal I've suffered enough

1056
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,160

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,540

00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,540
anymore something Clicks in

1079
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,579
it's a survival mechanism that started

1080
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,119
at the beginning of time with the wild

1081
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:17,119
blueberry

1082
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,599
where you once learned it's not good for

1083
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,579
you something Clicks in where you once

1084
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,500
learn it's not good you know it's time

1085
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:28,020
to stay away from that caffeine in the

1086
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,540
vinegar and the salt all the salt and

1087
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,060
the chocolate you know it's time

1088
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,460
something rewires in your emotional

1089
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,339
centers of your brain that says I can't

1090
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,740
destroy myself anymore

1091
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,020
I can't search for validation to support

1092
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,060
something that's harming me from the

1093
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,400
Cults out there

1094
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:49,859
from the vinegar cult and the chocolate

1095
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,440
Colts out there and the all that the

1096
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:54,839
cacao Cults and everything all the Cults

cults and the alcohol cults

1099
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,599
right and all of it and above something

1100
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,300
inside of you says I'm not going to

1101
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,400
partake in the cult anymore that's out

1102
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,079
there I don't want to destroy myself

1103
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,540
anymore I've been through hell and back

1104
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,319
I've suffered enough I've been sick I

1105
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,319
can't take it anymore

1106
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:21,180
I've been pushed around too much

1107
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,520
I've been toyed with too much

1108
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,579
I'm not in the business of destroying

1109
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,160
myself anymore because I want to live I

1110
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:30,720
want to heal I'm not afraid to heal I've

1111
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,420
never been I've never been afraid to

1112
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,420
heal and it's time

1113
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,579
why am I saying all this

1114
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,240
on blueberry day

1115
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:44,339
whoop pardon me on wild blueberry day

1116
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,240
because a blueberry can't do anything

1117
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:51,000
for us like a wild blueberry can

1118
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,040
this is a wild food

1119
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,660
it has lived for thousands upon

1120
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,160
thousands of years

1121
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,640
it wasn't

1122
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:04,319
grafted into some kind of thing and then

1123
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:08,480
plant it to be cultivated it is wild

1124
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,480
and it Harbors information

1125
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,660
what happens in us when that wire gets

1126
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,760
tripped and we're done with the Colts

1127
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,119
and we're we're totally awake and we

1128
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,240
really truly became awake

1129
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,040
this enough is enough strength inside of

1130
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,260
everyone it starts to kick in it's the

1131
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,000
moment when you put your foot down it's

1132
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,280
the moment when you truly find yourself

1133
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,560
when you're working with and aligned

1134
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,780
with your body that's what the wild

1135
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,599
blueberry is about it's about aligning

1136
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,160
with our body it's about taking the

1137
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:40,260
subconscious's Consciousness and the

1138
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,680
soul and the physical brain and making

1139
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:46,920
it become one so it's not fragmented

1140
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,900
not even the snakiest salesman on social

1141
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:52,800
media videos or the sneakiest

1142
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:55,619
chiropractor doctor or nutritionist

1143
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,140
on The snakiest infomercials can give

1144
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:01,079
you the validation anymore to go into

1145
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:04,020
the robotic mode of I'm going to destroy

1146
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,300
myself with a smile on my face

1147
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,819
and be happy thinking about it

1148
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,380
because my body deserves and needs what

1149
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,720
I'm putting in it

1150
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,180
that old brainwashing that manipulated

1151
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,980
your trusty wire and sent a message to

1152
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,780
your brain's emotional centers to

1153
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,119
override Common Sense and Sensibility

1154
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,040
about what your body really needs that

1155
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,680
brainwashing won't work anymore

1156
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,260
even if everyone around you has been

1157
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,880

when that time comes that's when you're

1175
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,540

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,700
it's The Rebirth of finally moving out

1177
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:10,859
of that mental and emotional pain moving

1178
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,359

and that reminds me

1181
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,440

and then it's there for us

1186
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,900
and it's that spiritual power it holds

1187
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,180
that blue color is an anthocyan and it's

1188
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,880
different than any other anthocyanin and

1189
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:38,720
it goes to the brain and it heads into

1190
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:41,160
the emotional center of the brain and it

00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,559
anthocyanins a little bit more as well

1289
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,040
and we're going to talk about

1290
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,099
antioxidants too not all antioxidants

1291
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:56,099
are the same not all people are the same

1292
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:58,440
not all water is the same

1293
00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:01,380
that's something to know

1294
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,940
and certainly not all antioxidants are

1295
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,180
the same

1296
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,520
now this is a wild food

1297
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,380
it's entirely different than a

1298
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,359
cultivated Berry

1299
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:14,099

1300
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,480

blueberries did you have it in the hmds

1346
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,260

1347
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,880
experience with it along the way do you

1348
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,280
love your wild blueberries that's

1349
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,800
another thing all on its own

1350
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:24,180
so that's important too so I'm just

1351
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:26,520
making sure that I have that heating up

1352
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,839
now

1353
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,460
there we go

1354
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,460
now the warm wild blueberry Bowl

1355
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:38,119
is a special one

1356
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,119
I really love it

1357
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,760
I'm going to take this lid and move it

1358
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,020
you know my favorite thing is it's not

1359
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:50,760
just this wild blueberry challenge

1360
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:54,000
like one of my favorite things is

1361
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,619
starting to like cook and do stuff you

1362
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,200
know like this because this is what I

1363
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,520
love right so I want to do more lives in

1364
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,720
the future where I'm making some of the

1365
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,940
recipes out of these books which I'm

1366
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,260
excited about too so I'm looking forward

1367
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,880
to that

1368
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,240
now

1369
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:12,839
when it comes down to anthocyanins

1370
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,839
you're looking at amphocyanins with a

1371
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:19,339
real rich rich blue color that purple

1372
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,720
blue color okay now

1373
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:23,940
anthocyanins for different parts of the

1374
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,920
body like they go in different places in

1375
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,319
the body and what I love about the wild

1376
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,740
blueberry anthocyanins

1377
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:34,740
is this information I got from SOC is

1378
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:39,000
because of that rich color that deep

1379
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:41,160
deep blue color the anthocyanins are not

1380
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,079
designed to just go like

1381
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,700
in one specific like they're not

1382
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:48,420
designed to just go everywhere they're

1383
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,740
designed to head to the Noggin that's

1384
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,099
where they head

1385
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:57,059
okay because that blue color that

1386
00:56:52,099 --> 00:57:00,480
anthocyanin is geared for metaphysical

1387
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:02,760
and physical that's the whole point so

1388
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,680
when you see that deep blue color what

1389
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,720
you're seeing is metaphysical and that's

1390
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:09,240
what you have to think

1391
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,920
so I am going to get some arrowroot

1392
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,980
powder

1393
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,260
and uh one and a half tablespoons of

1394
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,660
water

1395
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,760
and get that in here I will try not to

1396
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:23,040
spill it on the book

1397
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,460
there's one tablespoon I'm going to do a

1398
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,460
half now

1399
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,240
perfect

1400
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,660
[Music]

1401
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,660
okay

1402
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,359
very interesting so I'm going to mix

1403
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,359
this up

1404
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,640
so this is the warm while the blueberry

1405
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,559
Bowl

1406
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,180
now I notice people will say like I

1407
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,760
don't have wild blueberries

1408
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,619
so I'm gonna use

1409
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,680
regular blueberry

1410
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:03,960
if you can't find a wild blueberry don't

1411
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,300
use a regular blueberry a cultivated

1412
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,040
regular blueberry won't cut it if you're

1413
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,960
looking for something Madison more

1414
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,920
medicinal and you can't find the wild

1415
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,040
blueberry

1416
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,460
then go with blackberries

1417
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,440
it's not going to do the same thing

1418
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:23,700
right it's not going to do the same

1419
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:25,980
thing but it's a step above your

1420
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,839
cultivated blueberry

1421
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,760
because a lot of people they'll just run

1422
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,380
to the store they don't really know

1423
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,059
anything about the wild liver they don't

1424
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,619
know anything about what's going on and

1425
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,720
they're uncertain like incredible let me

1426
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:38,880
just go get some blueberries it's not

1427
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:41,059
the same thing so that's important to

1428
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,059
know

1429
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,040
okay

1430
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,400
now I'm going to add this in

1431
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,900
so what you see here is the arrowroot

1432
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,700
starch

1433
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:56,280
okay

1434
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:59,599
I added a little bit of water to it

1435
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,599
and then it's going in now

1436
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:04,280
wonderful

1437
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,559
and now I'm going to Stir It

1438
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,720
I don't know how easy you can see this

1439
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,760
but

1440
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,760
there you are hey look at that

1441
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:33,780
fantastic

1442
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,700
let that get a little hotter

1443
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,440
I don't want to call I put them in they

1444
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,880
were already chilled the blueberries the

1445
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,220
wild blueberries were already some of

1446
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,240
them were frozen still I'm gonna cook it

1447
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,240
for about one more minute

1448
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,780
yep

1449
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:53,640
because you want your you want it to be

1450
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,339
a warm wild blueberry Bowl you don't

1451
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,319
want it to be a cold wild Livery Bowl

1452
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:59,940
because that will happen especially if

1453
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:02,520
you take them out of the freezer

1454
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:07,020
you want to make sure they're warm and

1455
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:10,040
nice and comfy and warm and fuzzy

1456
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,040
which is incredible

1457
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:19,339
and I'm going to get them ready now to

1458
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,339
serve if you guys don't mind

1459
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,339
and then next we're going to be making

1460
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,339
the wild blueberry latte

1461
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:32,579
grogu

1462
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:38,720
every time grogu gets Disturbed grogu

1463
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:38,720
sends me a telepathic message

1464
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,220
okay

1465
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:47,760
I'm trying to use here's the thing I'm

1466
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:50,880
trying to use the wild blueberry to help

1467
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,900
with the brain the emotional centers of

1468
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,480
the brain

1469
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,040
and grogu is sitting there sending

1470
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,660

1593
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:06,059

1594

1611
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:33,299
I think I'm gonna strain it you guys I'm

1612
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,839
not liking the way it looks I forgot to

1613
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:35,839
strain it

1614
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,880

1615
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,020

improvise

1620
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,960
do it right

1621
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,699
so I don't want to do it the lazy way

1622
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,859
today because I make this for myself all

1623
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:19,080
the time but I do it like the quick and

1624
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,179
lazy way

1625
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,620
I wouldn't call Lazy whatever I just

1626
01:09:21,179 --> 01:09:25,339
like whatever I slap it together

1627
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:28,440
whatever you want to call it

1628
01:09:25,339 --> 01:09:30,620
and but I want to do it like to the

1629
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:30,620
letter

1630
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,500
all right let's get that in the pan and

1631
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:45,719
let's get that going

1632
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:49,100
woo

1633
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,100
let it warm up a little bit

1634
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,440
I don't make it all the time all the

1635
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:58,440
time I just make it for guests that come

1636
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,360
and then then usually I just slap it

1637
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:03,320
together but like I want to like do it

1638
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,320
really nice right now

1639
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,219
so I make it when guests are

1640
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:15,860
coming and then when they try it they go

1641
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,860

these books and I did that right there

1677
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:38,100
on the medical game podcast and I have a

1678
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:39,659
new podcast episode coming out next week

1679
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:41,280
which is going to be awesome really

1680
01:11:39,659 --> 01:11:42,540
awesome too

1681
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,219
all right we're just getting this ready

1682
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:46,219
this is the wild blueberry latte

1683
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,260
amazing how you guys doing did you have

1684
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,800
your shots

1685
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,800
foreign

1686
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,980
all right

1687
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:11,400
now the thing is is that

1688
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:14,460
if you

1689
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,739
are wondering like why do I love the

1690
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,659
wild blueberries so much

1691
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:21,719
there's so many reasons it's hard to

1692
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:23,280
keep them all in all like count it

1693
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:25,320
because there's that many reasons

1694
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,640
because you're looking at extremely high

1695
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,440
antioxidants

1696
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,600
what does that mean when you have

1697
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:33,540
extremely high antioxidants

1698
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:35,640
helping the body to stop oxidizing what

1699
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:38,699
happens when the body's oxidizing or

1700
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:41,520
slowly dying or quickly dying

1701
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:44,580
So the faster somebody's oxidative rate

1702
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,140
is inside their body the faster they're

1703
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:48,780
dying

1704
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:52,280
so that's really what it comes down to

1705
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:54,540
yes you can have a lot of things

1706
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,620
oxidizing you right so I talk about that

1707
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,060
in the medical meeting books you can

1708
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,820
have a lot of different things that are

1709
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,620
oxidizing and breaking down the body

1710
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:05,040
so everybody's different they might have

1711
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:08,640
more oxidation than somebody else

1712
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,620
but oxidation is what breaks this down

1713
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,060
and it shortens our life one way or

1714
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:15,000
another regardless of what's Happening

1715
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:16,320
inside our bodies you guys I'm going to

1716
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,040

measuring cup is what I'm going to do

1760
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,860

and

1764
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:47,340
I'm going to pour this in

1765
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,460
and I'm not going to try to pour this on

1766
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:53,239
top of Roku right here

1767
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,239
nice

1768
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:10,340
get another little saucepan on

1769
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:10,340
I'm going to pour this into a cup

1770
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:27,659
so it's not done yet though you guys

1771
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:32,659
that's the wild blueberry latte

1772
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:32,659
in motion it's not done so there we go

1773
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:44,060
now I'm a I'm gonna froth

1774
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:44,060
this up or episode wait a second

1775
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,400
I'm going to put it in the pan first

1776
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,400
all right

1777
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:59,880
okay just want enough in there

1778
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:02,060
we're doing it we're heating it up right

1779
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,060
now

1780
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:07,500
now I don't want to turn this blue what

1781
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,480
happens is if we have so much blue juice

1782
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,219
around and everything else like that you

1783
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:14,159
don't want to turn it blue so I'm going

1784
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:17,699
to get a new utensil because I've done

1785
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:20,940
this before where I turned

1786
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:23,179
it blew and you just want you don't want

1787
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,179
that

1788
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:30,020
okay

1789
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,880
it's kind of breaking it up a little bit

1790
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:45,120
hmm

1791
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,280
if you guys just came on here I'm making

1792
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,780
the wild blueberry

1793
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,640
latte

1794
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,980
from brain saver

1795
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,500
I want to show you what it looks like I

1796
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:57,960
don't think I did that yet I might have

1797
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:00,360
here it is this is what I'm making right

1798
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:03,679
now you guys

1799
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,679
the wild blueberry latte

1800
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:11,659
since I'm such a snob

1801
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,659
I like my lattes

1802
01:18:18,179 --> 01:18:21,920
just heating up the milk

1803
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,380
non-dairy this is coconut milk right

1804
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,380
here

1805
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:35,280
latte's almost done nice and hot inside

1806
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,040
here we're almost there

1807
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,640
but we have to we have to froth it so

1808
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,640
that's next

1809
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:46,620
it's getting a little bit hotter because

1810
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,540
you want that heat to get into it

1811
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:51,659
because when you get the heat into it

1812
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:54,420
you can froth it up better

1813
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:58,140
if it's not really warm enough you can't

1814
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:01,219
give it that froth that you got to do

1815
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,219
just about there

1816
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:06,620
and I got this little frothing tool

1817
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,040
this is a great holiday treat

1818
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:17,400
because you can it just keeps everything

1819
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:20,420
so good and so good for you so it's an

1820
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,420
incredible holiday tree

1821
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,560
all right so we're just about there

1822
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:31,760
we're gonna pour back now into

1823
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,760
the measuring cup

1824
01:19:33,179 --> 01:19:35,780
perfect

1825
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:42,860

1826
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:50,360

I think this has gotten definitely nice

1839
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,320
in

1840
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,900
frothy

1841
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,239
all right

1842
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,800
let's go

1843
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,560
now what you want to do is you want to

1844
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:55,620
put this gently in here you don't want

1845
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,199
to just push it all in there one shot

1846
01:20:55,620 --> 01:21:00,739
you just want to kind of have it gently

1847
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:00,739
go in

1848
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:04,040
like this

1849
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:13,580
you don't want to mix the two you don't

1850
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:19,199
want the blue

1851
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:21,000
mixing with the froth the coconut froth

1852
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:24,199
how high you want to bring it to the top

1853
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,199
is totally up to you

1854
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:30,420
I'm going to bring it up really high

1855
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:32,460
so that froth is kind of like right up

1856
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:34,739
there whoa

1857
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:37,620
that's insane

1858
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:39,540
that is just insane

1859
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,800
I'm really proud of myself right now you

1860
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:42,179
guys

1861
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,199
seriously I'm gonna sprinkle a little

1862
01:21:42,179 --> 01:21:45,199
bit of cinnamon on top

1863
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:51,679
you don't want to overdo it

1864
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,679
darn

1865
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:57,420
it's not what I wanted to do I wanted to

1866
01:21:54,659 --> 01:22:01,640
sprinkle it everywhere on top

1867
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,640
and not in just one shot like that

1868
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,020
that's how it was supposed to be done

1869
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:09,020
right there

1870
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,659
you live and learn I'm only human

1871
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,940
that is

1872
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:24,360
incredible tasting when you guys try it

1873
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:26,580
you guys are going to be mind blown

1874
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,940
and you know what

1875
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:32,880
it's like you're not self-sabotaging

1876
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:36,060
it's you're not like you're not

1877
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,980
brainwashed out there to self-sabotage

1878
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,480
with all the addictions that we don't

1879
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,940
even know we have

1880
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,340
we're far from it

1881
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:47,520
this is entirely different

1882
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,780
and the wild blueberry has so much to do

1883
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,120
with it

1884
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:56,040
because it gets to our brain it rewires

1885
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:58,800
us and it stops us from being a toy

1886
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,360
it stops us from being a tool for the

1887
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,920
industries

1888
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,380
