we can all become consumed by what we're

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,800
eating is that true

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,780
can we all become consumed about what

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,479
we're eating if you ever hear someone

112
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,460
say I don't think about food ever

113
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,880
I don't think about food it's not even

114
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,699

want whatever right no they're thinking

120
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,820
about food all the time that's the whole

121
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,160
point if you're a human being on this

122
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,360
planet do not get tricked by that if

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,520
you're a human being on this planet

124
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,580
you're thinking about food

125
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,259
you are no matter what kind of situation

126
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,759
is going on I'm reading a little bit of

127
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:10,680
the eating disorder chapter right here

128
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,120
and this chapter is huge and there's a

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,180
lot of information in it but I'm

130
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,460
scratching the surface a little bit

131
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,500
are we eating too much

132
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,580
has anybody been concerned about are we

133
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,320
eating too much

134
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,240
that's something I think a lot of people

135
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,759
are concerned about

136
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,740
are we eating too little have you ever

137
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,479
heard that before where there's people

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,740
that are concerned they're eating too

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,600
little

140
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,100
it's either you're eating too much or

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,020
you're eating too little what is it

142
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,840
right

143
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,560
I mean are we eating when we're not

144
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,600
hungry have you heard that one before

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,280

our food on a daily basis

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,759
do we convince ourselves that we're

169
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,500
eating in moderation or eating balanced

170
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600

180
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,840

187
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,680
do we punish ourselves for eating the

188
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,599
wrong things how many people punish

189
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,160
themselves for eating that chocolate

excitement I can't even explain

233
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,519
nicolinus as an IG I've had people make

234
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,700
me feel bad about food saying you don't

235
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:10,080
need to eat that or you know what to do

236
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,120
to lose weight I've always had a bad

237
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,860
relationship with food since I was

238
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,320
younger

239
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,180
let's keep on reading a little bit

240
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,180
Eating Disorders are rampant

241
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,320

242
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,279
they are eating disorders are rampant

243
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,560
they can exist in every one of us yes

244
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,060
it wouldn't make sense okay here check

245
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,519
this out

246
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,380
we're all consumed about food if we

247
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,080
weren't it wouldn't make sense because

248
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,760
we have to be concerned about food when

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,100
people say I'm not concerned about food

250
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,580
that's not me I have no concerns about

251
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,660
food b s

252
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,000
capital b capital s

253
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,399
everybody's concerned about food or

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,959
they're an alien and they're not you

255
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,959
know aliens are concerned about food

256
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,920
everybody's concerned about food

257
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,380
or you cease to exist it's just an uh

258
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,420
you know on our radar

259
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,100
if we weren't it wouldn't make sense

260
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,820
because we have to be concerned about

261
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,860
food it's how we live work play function

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,779
you want to function you got to be

263
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,420
concerned about food

264
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,700
loving healing says I used to be I used

265
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,860
to stress so much about food always so

266
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,959
much Obsession and guilt two years on

267
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,839
medical medium protocols and I feel so

268
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,220
free food makes me happy now no more

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,720
guilt that's what I love about the

270
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,660
medical medium

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,779
food protocols in the medical medium

272
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,180
cleanses in the medical medium words of

273
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,839
wisdom from above because it frees us

274
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,839
from that

275
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,860
it really does

276
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,680
that's always been a part of our history

277
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,680
as humans we are focused on food right

278
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,779
what makes it a food disorder in today's

279
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,940
modern world is the amount of unhealthy

280
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:10,220
conditioning all around us combined with

281
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,220
contaminants in our brains so

282
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,959
food disorders can happen from our

283
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,880
brains being saturated with all kinds of

284
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,100
contaminations and all kinds of

285
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,260
different stuff that I talk about in the

286
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,120
medical medium book series our brains

287
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,500
get filled with it and that could make

288
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,500
things a lot more difficult

289
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,920
and so what we have to do is learn how

290
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,019
to eat in order and not have an eating

291
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,800
disorder it's more of like what can I

292
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:40,019
eat to heal myself what can I eat that's

293
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,720
going to change my life and turn my life

294
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,360
around there's nothing wrong with having

295
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,519
that sense of understanding and that

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,320
sense of knowing there's nothing wrong

297
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,240
with being like what can I eat to get

298
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,720
myself better what can I eat to heal

299
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,200
what can I eat to turn my life around

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,060
what's wrong with that nothing nothing's

301
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,560
wrong with that that's eating in order

302
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,940
that's putting things in perspective

303
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,980
that's putting things in order that's

304
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,380
putting things in the right situation

305
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,600
for your body it's like no I want to eat

306
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,680

thank you

308
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,100
eating in order can have a few meanings

309
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,140
eating in order to heal

310
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,260
in order to heal

311

336
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,360

337
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,360

338
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,420
so yeah

339
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,940
so why Colin says I need to download

340
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,920
that Mantra in my brain what can I eat

341
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,920
to heal what can I eat to heal

342
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,880
a focus on food is not on its own

343
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,040
unhealthy

344
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,740
do not let anybody convince you that

345
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,839
focusing on food is unhealthy don't let

346
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,560
someone convince you of that that's a

347
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,300
bad convincing I'm serious that is not a

348
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,459
good thing

349
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,800
often when we're trying to take care of

350
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,320
ourselves holistically and heal from

351
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,899
symptoms and conditions buying the right

352
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,880
Foods consuming fruits vegetables eating

353
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,279
less processed foods looking after

354
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,980
ourselves in general we can feel like

355
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,680
we're trapped and we're alone and

356
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,160
worried about food in a bubble of our

357
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,959
own world unless we find our others like

358
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,880
us right so that's another thing once

359
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,800
you have to start healing and start

360
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,420
eating better we can feel like lonely

361
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,700
and lost and we're like stuck in this

362
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,820
bubble

363
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,560
foreign

364
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,779
alone and worried about food in a bubble

365
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,060
of our own world unless we find others

366
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,540
like us even when we're doing it right

367
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,060
life becomes all about what to eat how

368
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,639
healthy it is where to find it we can

369
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,380
get lost wondering does anyone else have

370

they don't have to worry about anything

387
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,040
but they're still worried to some degree

388
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,779
even if they're not eating healthy

389
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,720

had every single eating disorder there

458
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,660

that thing worked for me

464
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,600
incredible credible information you guys

465
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,340
we're doing it

466
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,660
let's see cold White Springs says

467
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,660
McDonald's is an eating disorder

468
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,660
interesting

469
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,340
only medical medium protocol work to

470
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,620
heal me

471
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,620
that's in that last uh IG comment

472
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,280
okay all this is important information

473
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,760
let's get down to it right now

474
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
okay

475
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,160
eating the right items at the right time

476
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,100
can still feel as if you have an eating

477
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,260
disorder because of how others view it

478
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,179
others view it

479
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,820
one of the problems when you're trying

480
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,520
to heal is what others are viewing of

481
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,500
what you're doing

482
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,360
that's one of the problems

483
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,860
when you're trying to heal is what

484
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,440
others are viewing

485
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,260
other people are judging other people

486
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,660
got their eyes on you right how many

487
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,500
people have their eyes there's eyes on

488
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,840
them

489
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,760
keep that in mind because that can then

490
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,380
Propel someone to feel like they're

491
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,700
doing it wrong that they're in an eating

492
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,160
disorder

493
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,740
when you're trying to eat healthy others

494
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,419
often see it as too rigid

495
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,419
what do you do in your celery juice

496
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:53,039
again you're doing your celery juice one

497
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,740
more time what do you do in your brain

498
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,460
shot therapy one more time is it a

499
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,460
little too much

500
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,539
they may even even label it orthorexia

501
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:11,059
orthorexic right

502
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,059
when someone scoffs down a cheese pizza

503
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:16,260
right

504
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,419
in a Coca-Cola

505
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:22,160
and they're calling you orthorexic

506
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,160
because you're trying to heal yourself

507
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,539
let's just insane

508
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,720
Erica Alex says and that mm protocols

509
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,820
healed my worsening bulimia whoa that I

510
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,880
suffered with for years

511
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,799
oh God said I'm just happier here and

512
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
healing so many people have been through

513
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,600
that and it's it's just so hard I tried

514
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,580
doctors and therapists and nothing

515
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,620
worked when all hope was lost the

516
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,419
medical medium healed me completely with

517
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,419
no relapses incredible

518
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,960
so when someone names somebody

519
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,000
orthorexic which you'll read about later

520
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,919

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,080

522
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,720
read this book brand saver Michelle L

523
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,160
says the bullying about what I eat has

524
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,160
been unbelievable capitalized

525
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:13,559
okay

526
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,240
they may even label it orthorexia which

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,220
can get blamed for too much fruit

530
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,960
fruit first of all fruit wasn't allowed

531
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,780
in any of the eat better diets out there

532
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,840
medical medium

533
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,840
spent the last 30 plus years bringing

534
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,539
fruit into the health world because it

535
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,480
wasn't allowed

536
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:43,200
the only place fruit was allowed was

537
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,059
believe it or not the the food pyramid

538
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,580
where they said you still should have

539
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,700
some servings of fruit meanwhile in all

540
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,299
of the health realm Alternative Health

541
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,059
fruit was never allowed it was demonized

542
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,640
and I spent decades trying to bring it

543
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,260

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,179

foreign

556
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,299
but fruit is is critical but how many

557
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,539
people were blamed for eating fruit

558
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:34,460
Laura Robinson says mm has healed me and

559
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:36,720
my hair is thicker and stronger amazing

560
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,419

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,880
enough protein

562
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:45,179
you're not eating enough protein where's

563
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,280
your protein protein robot we'll do that

564
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,500
half time

565
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,720
too many carbs whoa that's too many

566
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,880
carbs don't eat that banana first of all

567
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,679
it's a fruit and it's way too many carbs

568
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,600
how about that one how many people are

569
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,640
said to that lizards is right I saw that

570
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,799
on IG you like that one lizards it's

571
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,020
endless bringing your own food to

572
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,000
holidays is difficult not eating at

573
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,240
events where the menu doesn't work for

574
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,600
you always packing snacks orientating

575
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,720
your life around the farmers markets or

576
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,340
making special requests at restaurants

577
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,260
none of this should be considered an

578
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,260
eating disorder when what you're doing

579
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,900
is eating in order to truly heal did you

580
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:26,940
guys hear that how many people get

581
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,980
punished for actually picking and

582
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,140
choosing at the restaurant packing

583
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,360
snacks making sure you're taking care of

584
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,600
yourself having like your fruit with you

585
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,700
okay all of that how many people are

586
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,760
punished for making special requests in

587
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,700
restaurants or punished for like

588
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,299
bringing their food to an event or not

589
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:52,559
so many people are punished in that way

590
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:55,080
now don't we want to feel normal

591
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,299
to go out and eat a pizza or some fried

592
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,940
food or cheesy pasta or a grass-fed

593
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,980
burger or maybe some sushi

594
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,080
to go over to a friend's house and eat

595
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,340
whatever they're serving have ice cream

596
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,380
afterwards

597
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,940
to eat whatever's on the table at a

598
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,820
family holiday without worrying about

599
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,580
how it's going to affect your bloating

600
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,320
your stomach your cramps your gastritis

601
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,700
your diarrhea your constipation your

602
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
heartburn your acid reflux your

603
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:24,240
indigestion and acne

604
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,159
we all want to feel normal right we all

605
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,039
want to scoff down that cheese pizza no

606
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:31,860
problem and eat whatever we want to do

607
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,659
the irony is that all the people who

608
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,059
seem normal

609
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:38,460
actually

610
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:41,840
normalize dysfunctional eating and have

611
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,840
Eating Disorders themselves

612
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,620
I mean seriously

613
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,140
so that's what's happening out there

614
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,299
right everybody wants to be normal but

615
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,120
the whole thing is that normal our

616
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:00,299
Eating Disorders that's the whole point

617
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,480
let's see rolanki says yes the

618
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:06,600
functional doctors did all cat good

619
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,140
sensitivity Foods food sensitivity tests

620
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,940
and I couldn't eat this and many veggies

621
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,740
were out too it was horrible that's

622
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,600
another thing the food sensitivity test

623
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,580
that I've watched people go through hell

624
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,640
with for years

625
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,640
and what happened to their food eating

626
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,919
I always say this okay

627
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,020
so functional doctors said don't eat

628
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,460
fruits and certain vegetables and that

629
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,140
whole thing right so then you you're

630
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,179
stuck with this food sensitivity test

631
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,779
where you were just eating what meat and

632
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:39,600
meat only right red Rosia says or eat

633
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:41,880
this burger and eat this pork rib you

634
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,740
need to gain weight as if that's the

635
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,200
only way to gain weight I could eat

636
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,840
clean and Gain

637
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,360
I think what people don't realize

638
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,580
really is that how many people are

639
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,779
ostracized and made fun of for trying to

640
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,620
eat

641
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,900
healthy for real healthy right

642
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:02,640
Hillary said

643
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,220
my eating disorder was completely

644
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,220
obliterated when I learned and applied

645
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,520
these protocols and I don't apply it as

646
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,980
often as I want but I am still healed

647
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,960
from that incredible

648
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,419
look you know you can always come back

649
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,020
as well come back to the medical medium

650
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:25,260
information too you can always come back

651
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,059
and then here's what I've noticed some

652
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,279
people in their life when they get a

653
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,659
medical medium book and they read it

654
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,059
they're at a different point in their

655
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,279
life and they need to come back to it

656
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,840
years later and then they read it and

657
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
they see it in a whole different light

658
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,400
they're like why didn't I see it that

659
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,179
way what happened why did I just lose

660
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,179
two more years

661
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,840
all right so we all want to feel normal

662
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,940
the irony is that with all the people

663
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,740
who seem normal actually normalize

664
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,840
dysfunctional eating and have Eating

665
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,299
Disorders themselves they don't eat

666
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,039
correctly no one has ever been taught

667
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:08,340
what our brain and body need what foods

668
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,620
our organs need what foods to eat for a

669
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,059
physical spiritual emotional and mental

670
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,360
health

671
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:18,720
were left to our own demise here on

672
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,659
planet Earth no one has taught the right

673
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,419
things it's painstaking and here's a

674
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:26,940
point I just want to be clear about you

675
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:30,480
tell me if this point is or not

676
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,840
you tell me go ahead judge me I need you

677
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,059
guys to judge me on this point right

678
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,059
you got all these eat betters you know

679
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:41,039
things out there books and programs you

680
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,260
got all these exactly all cat tests and

681
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,779
food sensitivity tests

682
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,820
but what do you think about this

683
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:49,440
all those professionals don't know why

684
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,600
we're sick science and research doesn't

685
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,299
know why we're sick they don't they

686
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,159
don't have the answers but yet they're

687
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,080
right about what you should be eating I

688
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,520
guess

689
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,520
am I wrong to say that

690
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,580
so they're right about what you should

691
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,299
be eating when they don't know why

692
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:12,240
you're even sick the true cause

693
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:13,140
and what's bringing you down in your

694
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,720
life

695
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:20,100
and why you're suffering if they don't

696
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:23,840
know why why why then why are they right

697
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,840
and what they're telling you to eat

698
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,940
when I think about that I'm like okay

699
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,000
in order to heal you have to get your

700
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,039
Foods figured out

701
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,720
you have to understand your foods and

702
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,039
get them in order

703
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,720
that's what we're doing right now we're

704
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,000
doing the brain shot therapy cleanse

705
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,120
challenge right 20 days of it that alone

706
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,919
is a powerful tool and that's what we're

707
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,659
doing right now you have to understand

708
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,000
your foods and get them in order when

709
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,100
your foods are in disorder that's when

710
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,840
you get an eating disorder when you

711
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,580
don't know what the hell we eat when the

712
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,900
hell to eat it well you don't know what

713
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,720
you're doing

714
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,279
The Whole World's all scrambled up as to

715
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,600
what's good for you eggs are good for

716
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,580
you you need your protein make sure

717
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,640
you're on your eggs you need a good hard

718
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,039
cheese don't do the American soft cheese

719
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,080
you need a good hard cheese as if that's

720
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:18,899
the answer you need to eat good butter

721
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,460
grass-fed butter that's the answer you

722
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:22,200
need to be a vegan you need to be a

723
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,480
plant-based person you need to be eating

724
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,159
lots of nut Butters only like the amount

725
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,419
of stuff you need to be carnivore you

726
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,899
need to be this

727
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,419
like it's Insanity out there and that

728
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,380
Insanity alone can create Eating

729
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,380
Disorders already

730
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,059
many times

731
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:43,679
all right

732
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,000
you have to understand your foods and

733
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,260
get them in order when your foods are in

734
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,899
disorder that's when you can get an

735
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,940
eating disorder everyone has has been

736
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:52,500
there wondering what to eat and everyone

737
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,840
is guessing

738
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,120
guessing that's what I was trying to say

739
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,799
all right you guys read a little bit

740
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,299
more but I'm just telling you right now

741
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,520
we're day one

742
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:06,600
we're doing 20 days call me crazy

743
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:09,240
because that's one killer long cleanse

744
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,840
and I'm excited about it so I'm on page

745
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,880
273 in Eating Disorders chapters where I

746
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,580
am I got more to go

747
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,880
so let's go a little bit more many times

748
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,799
food contributes to not feeling well

749
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,840
eating foods that are not appropriate

750
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,760
for healing can contribute to developing

751
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,399
a condition illness or disease

752
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,380
contributing

753
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,140
not the cause

754
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,120
but contributing keep that in mind so

755
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,520
what seemed to be normal eating normal

756
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,860
acting normal being normal with food

757
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,500
wasn't a good normal because it was

758
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,960
contributing to someone getting sick

759
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,539
eating normal acting normal being normal

760
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,340
with food wasn't a good normal it's it

761
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:52,320
might have seemed like a good normal

762
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,240
because you were with family and friends

763
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,039
it might have seemed like a good normal

764
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,140
because the food seemed tasty and

765
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,840
satiating it might have seemed like a

766
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,940
good normal because it was convenient is

767
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,220
your mind blowing right now like sure am

768
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,899
I just blowing up it might have seemed

769
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,940
like a good normal because it offered

770
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:12,059
comforting Sensations that connected you

771
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:16,320
with past memories in life

772
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:18,299
it wasn't good for other reasons though

773
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,700
people who try to use food to heal

774
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:23,700
especially young people will frequently

775
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,559
be blamed for disordered eating in the

776
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,740
older days it was even more common

777
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,140
particularly if it was a young adult

778
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,419
trying to heal from chronic illness by

779
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,120
eating fruits and vegetables they could

780
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:38,460
be taken to a clinic and force-fed

781
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,320
prompted by well-meaning family members

782
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,360
who were actually the ones with the

783
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,980

we're in a better safer place now with

811
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:56,399
food than we were just two decades ago

812
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,500
people can be dragged out of their

813
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,559
houses

814
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,960
by guys in white coats putting you in

815
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,960
straight jackets years ago it was done

816
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,380
it's just terrifying

817
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,899
bring in more plant Foods is more

818
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,940
accepted not fully accept it believe it

819
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:17,640
or not but more accepted just becoming

820
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,200
more upset accepted a lot of confusion

821
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,600
around eating disorders and healthy

822
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,220
eating remains and rightfully so there

823
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,140
are many Trends in the health field that

824
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,880
aren't right for the body and they can

825
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,440
rain on the parade of better approaches

826
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,320
and holistic health

827
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,360
medical meme information has healed so

828
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,860
many people around the world

829
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,159
but there's

830
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,140
Trends out there that ruin it

831
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,059
because they're so scrambled up with

832
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,860
misinformation

833
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,080
some health professionals become

834
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,820
Reckless and it ends up looking bad for

835
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,100
everyone in the natural health field

836
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,100
people venturing into certain cleanses

837
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,080
certain detox programs and certain diets

838
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,580
already have eating disorders and when

839
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,380
they do these Reckless diets and

840
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,460
cleanses it worsens their eating

841
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,559
disorders

842
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:03,179
creating more confusion fear and

843
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,940
frustration this is critical right here

844
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:07,919
this could give Healthy eating a bad

845
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,139
name and even start a new eating

846
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,359
disorder because the makers of these

847
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,280
diets and programs out there have no

848
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:15,659
idea why anyone is sick to begin with

849
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,300
that's the point right there you guys

850
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,639
it's a huge point they have no idea why

851
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,700
anybody is sick to begin with why should

852
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,500
I trust medical mediums protocols

853
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,700
because you finally have answers why

854
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,679
you're sick

855
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,500
why should I track why should I trust

856
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,419
medical medium food protocols and his

857
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,060
lenses

858
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:38,339
because you know why you got sick to

859
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,919
begin with why shouldn't I trust those

860
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:43,020
out there they don't know why anyone got

861
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:45,780
sick because the makers of the diets and

862
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,820
programs have no idea why anyone is sick

863
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,940
to begin with so the information they

864
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,820
are giving others to use

865
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,619
is not in a good order for the body

866
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,839

I hope you like Dill

1143
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,880
potent herb

1144
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,140
very potent herb

1145
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:02,880

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,760
half cup tightly packed spinach

1148
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:13,740
that's next try to do it in order if you

1149
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:15,300
can like as it directs in the book

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,040
Drake Clark

1151
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,140
what are the rules for doing three

1152
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,300
different shots in one day how many

1153
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,060
hours apart

1154
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:27,180
if you read the book it says space them

1155
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,520
four hours apart

1156
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,260
if you read the book

1157
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,940
okay guys

1158
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,619
food for your shifter are you doing it

1159
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,560
with me right now

1160
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:39,000
are we doing it together so that's about

1161
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,920
tightly packed because I'm talking about

1162
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,420
tightly packed right there let's move

1163
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:45,839
into the next one

1164
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,660
three quarters of a cup of

1165
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:52,680
sword mango

1166
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,900
Frozen mango works or you can do fresh

1167
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,020
mango I don't have a fresh mango right

1168
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:02,400
now but I love love love love

1169
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:04,800
Frozen mango too okay there we go

1170
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,660
nice

1171
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,260
and then we're gonna go with some celery

1172
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:14,060
right a quarter of a stock

1173
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,060
let's get some celery down in there

1174
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,280
incredible

1175
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,980
now the amazing thing about these shots

1176
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,500
is they're so potent you can feel it as

1177
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,420
it's entering you so keep that in mind

1178
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,119
okay

1179
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,280
now what I have on here I have the if

1180
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:35,220
you have this juicer I have the celery

1181
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,640
end cap the high compression

1182
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:42,359
right and what that does is it squeezes

1183
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,260
every last drop practically out of the

1184
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,380
food

1185
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,660
so this is the Omega mm 1500 if you're

1186
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,940
curious right

1187
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,619
and you can just you can just juice with

1188
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:55,140
this all day if you wanted to juice and

1189
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:56,940
stuff but what's powerful about this

1190
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,500
is what you're going to see is you're

1191
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,380
not going to see

1192
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,900
all this wet sloppy stuff come out of

1193
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,700
this end if that's the case you're going

1194
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,040
to need like a lot of other juicers

1195
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,099
you're going to need instead of a half

1196
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,260
cup of spinach or a half cup of Dill

1197
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:16,319
you're going to need that much still

1198
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:18,119
probably that much spinach because it's

1199
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,160
all going to come out the pulp's going

1200
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,960
to come out flying sloppy it's just

1201
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,980
going to be sloppy mushy you know wet

1202
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,000
right

1203
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,000
okay there we go

1204
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,960
so I have a screen on here so I'm just

1205
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,960
moving some of it through the screen

1206
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,040
okay there we go

1207
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:43,980
and if you want to

1208
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,200
all right I'm gonna take my screen off

1209
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,819
for the second here that's my shot right

1210
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,160
there

1211
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:53,540
didn't even need that it was incredible

1212
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,540
didn't even need this

1213
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,480
all right

1214
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:07,040
let me show you this right up close

1215
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,040
maybe we'll even

1216
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,280
that's it

1217
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,339
you guys have your shot ready

1218
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:30,010
I'm gonna take a little sip

1219
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,010
[Music]

1220
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,839
there's a feeling I get

1221
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,880
and there you guys do these shots so you

1222
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:41,700
know what I'm talking about right where

1223
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,520
it just starts to come over you

1224
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:48,319
because it's about the combination the

1225
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,319
amounts and what it's for

1226
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:55,079
that's my second little step

1227
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,330
I'm nursing this one for the moment

1228
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,800
but I could feel it

1229
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:00,540
[Music]

1230
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,280
I get like a charge

1231
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,760
right now I'm feeling like I'm getting

1232
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,099
charged up all here

1233
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,599
right from the brain stem really it

1234
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:12,119
feels like the brain stem is getting

1235
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,819
charged so I feel energy moving through

1236
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:16,500
the brain stem right now I don't feel it

1237
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:19,579
on the top I feel it in the brain stem

1238
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,579
area right now for me

1239
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,700
I'm going to send the whole thing down

1240
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,060

1243
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,180
give me another

1244
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,119
and I'm feeling all through my body

1245
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,680
right now

1246
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:47,780
it's incredible

1247
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,780
you guys have you tried this one you

1248
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,680
if you want to make all three and make

1249
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,040
them all at once

1250
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,240
seal them in an air type container if

1251
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,460
you can

1252
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,680
put them in the fridge in an airtight

1253
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,260
container if you want to do that Monica

1254
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,119
M says can you freeze the shots aw yes

1255
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,880
you can if you want to freeze them you

1256
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,740
can for some reason if you need to yes

1257
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,839
you can

1258
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,359
incredible have you guys done this one

1259
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:18,000
what do you feel right now let me know

1260
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:20,819
how you you know tag on medical medium

1261
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,319
medical medium you know when you do your

1262
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:23,700
post whatever your real estate stores I

1263
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,559
would love to see them I'd love to

1264
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,940
repost them if I can that would be

1265
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:29,940
incredible

1266
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,579
and it's best to fresh and not frozen

1267
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,440
and not sitting all day but it's but you

1268
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:35,579
still if you had to do it that way then

1269
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,380
I understand

1270
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,000
Emily Marshall says we don't need to

1271
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,160
strain the shot then you don't have to

1272
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,880
if you don't want to I I do a little bit

1273
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,880
of a straining

1274
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,420
it's really potent

1275
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:51,359
it's really powerful

1276
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,220
I love the food for your one

1277
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,619
I get like

1278
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,619
the sensations haven't gone away from me

1279
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:00,839
they're still there after sending that

1280
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,180
down and I still feel it around the

1281
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:05,160
brain stem for that one which is really

1282
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:09,200
incredible

1283
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,200
I had a strainer for my shot

1284
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:17,220
amazing Pamela Miller says I felt it

1285
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:20,099
instantly as going down the hatch

1286
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,040
like I the thing is is the brain shot

1287
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:25,740
therapies that's how I feel it too

1288
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,800
and it puts me in a whole different mode

1289
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,660
a whole different mood it's really

1290
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,900
incredible

1291
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,599
if the be sure says is one brain shot

1292
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:38,819
enough like a single glass shot it is

1293
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,280
enough indeed because depending on

1294
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:44,040
ingredients some rain shots created up

1295
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,859
to five glass shots that's okay

1296
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,599
you can use what's left over too and

1297
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:51,000
make another shot absolutely what's

1298
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:55,079
going to happen is variations of how

1299
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:57,240
much how much juice content is in each

1300
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:59,160
thing you're using is going to kind of

1301
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,599
vary sometimes you get mangoes that are

1302
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,160
not as juicy sometimes you'll get

1303
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:04,319
spinach just a little bit more drier

1304
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,359
sometimes you'll get an herb that's a

1305
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,819
you know drier with a not a lot of water

1306
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,760
content in its stems and all of that

1307
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:14,220
plays a role when you're making it and

1308
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,079
that was all accounted for when Spirit

1309
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,700
of compassion was designing the brain

1310
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,220

Stevie Bella says while doing the shot

1316
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,260
challenge do you recommend that this be

1317
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,839
done at a particular time for instance

1318
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,819
someone has done 20 to 40 ounces of

1319
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,700
lemon water 16 to 20 ounces of celery

1320
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:43,920
juice is that shot next the book gives

1321
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:47,700
exact details to that particular

1322
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,460
question that you have it'll it'll spell

1323
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,619
it out for you which is incredible

1324
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,300
but great question

1325
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,160
you guys

1326
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,240

1327
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,859
shifter

1328
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,720
like

1329
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:02,880
I'm not afraid to eat a whole cheese

1330
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,819
pizza with sausage on it now and I'm

1331
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,680
kidding I'm not gonna eat that anyway

1332
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:09,599
but seriously

1333
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,559
it's actually kind of like lightened by

1334
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,079
heart

1335
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,460
I feel it's like it's working my brain

1336
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,280
stem right now

1337
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,280
it's what it's doing I feel like it's in

1338
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,819
here it's radiating around here and then

1339
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,460
I feel a cooling sensation happen from

1340
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:28,319
here on down which is so weird that's

1341
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,559

Disorders chapter in brain saver

1356
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,880
oftentimes an eating disorder develops

1357
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,099
because of a symptom

1358
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,180
I wanted to ask you guys a question how

1359
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:18,599

where

1364
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:28,319
a symptom came over you

1365
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:31,319
you got your first symptom or you got

1366
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,880
sick and then eating disorders what

1367
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,980
feels like eating disorders came

1368
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,720
afterwards

1369
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,660
how many people experience that because

1370
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,059
I know a lot of people experience that

1371
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,280
a symptom related to not being able to

1372
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,660
swallow correctly may be choking nausea

1373
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,839
pain in the stomach a feeling of

1374
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:51,059
tightness in the throat or chest

1375
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:53,760
how many people got like

1376
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:55,920
anxiety disorders

1377
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,619
right a condition where symptoms of

1378
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,079
anxiety and then that

1379
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,480
followed up and eating disorder because

1380
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,740
of the anxiety did that ever happen to

1381
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,740
you I'm saying you're saying I did

1382
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:09,180
you're saying yes so it's like you got

1383
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:11,040
it your first symptoms you got your

1384
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,780
first anxiety attacks you got your first

1385
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,280
panic attacks

1386
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,440
and then

1387
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,839
what came with that

1388
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,900
was all of a sudden eating problems

1389
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:23,700
because you had anxiety it started with

1390
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,460
that or what about a tightness of the

1391
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:30,000
throat what about a tightness

1392
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,619
of the chest right so maybe you got this

1393
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,599
symptom where it's the tightness of the

1394
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,700
chest tightness of the throat or maybe

1395
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,079
you got a stomach symptom

1396
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,180
did you guys ever have your first

1397
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,579
stomach symptoms where you're like

1398
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:44,099
serious bloating serious stomach

1399
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:46,680
symptoms going on

1400
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:49,200
and then that actually created an eating

1401
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,240
disorder now you don't know what to eat

1402
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,220
because your stomach's all wonky things

1403
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,059
are all strange with your stomach you

1404
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,059
don't know what to eat

1405
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,260
and so then an eating disorder followed

1406
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:03,300
after the symptom of having stomach

1407
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,460
problems having a throat tightness

1408
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,460
having chest tightness having anxiety

1409
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:13,980
yes too what about like

1410
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:16,020
OCD as well and then that follows into

1411
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,300
an eating disorder because of OCD you're

1412
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,059
suffering from or struggling from

1413
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:22,920
a symptom related to not being able to

1414
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,300
swallow correctly choking nausea pain in

1415
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,579
the stomach or feeling of tightness in

1416
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,460
the throat or chest right and instead of

1417
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:33,960
the Rope kindness in the chest

1418
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:35,760
we're losing the sense of taste or smell

1419
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,460
that's another thing that throws people

1420
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:41,160
into Eating Disorders it's the losing

1421
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:43,079
the taste or the smell

1422
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,599
this is where someone is living their

1423
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:48,900
life and they're eating just as anybody

1424
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:51,960
else would be eating and then these

1425
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,760
symptoms start to develop you're going

1426
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,440
through life you feel like you're just

1427
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,119
normally doing what you're doing

1428
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,980
you're eating what you're eating you're

1429
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,559
eating what everybody else is eating

1430
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:04,440
everything seems fine and dandy and then

1431
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:08,359
the symptoms happen

1432
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,359
and now an eating disorder starts

1433
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:13,559
in some cases if it's a chronic nausea

1434
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,640
for example then Foods become pick and

1435
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:17,640
choose

1436
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,440
chronic nausea that's a huge one right

1437
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:23,119
there

1438
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,119
that's a big one actually

1439
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,359
so many people have gone through that

1440
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,760
where it's like you got the chronic

1441
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:31,980
nausea and then you're in trouble it's a

1442
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,579
game of what's going to help ease my

1443
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:37,980
nausea what's going to help my nausea

1444
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:40,200

Angela

1453
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:03,420
I feel more energy when I do these brain

1454
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:06,839
shots and the pathogen exposure shots

1455
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:08,819
start staved off covet when I sat

1456
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:11,880

pathogen exposure shot that's amazing

1460
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:21,720
so what happens is when people get

1461
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:24,660
nausea that really triggers often to

1462
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,700
Boom a Cascade of

1463
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,740
Eating Disorders right

1464
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,540
what's not helping this nausea what's

1465
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,400
helping this nausea what foods do I eat

1466
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,960
because I'm nauseous do any of these

1467
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,180
Foods I'm eating contribute to my aunt

1468

1469
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:40,020
but it made me nauseous the other day

1470
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:42,059

1471
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:44,700

1472
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:46,740
what is it and that creates the Eating

1473
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,559
Disorders because it's like

1474
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,900
that food was working for me last week

1475
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:55,040
it was working for me yesterday how come

1476
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,040
it's not working for me today

1477
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:59,640
what's not helping with this nausea do

1478
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,280
any of these Foods I'm eating contribute

1479
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,720
to it how come when I'm not eating I

1480
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,980
still have the nausea then that's

1481
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,839
another thing too

1482
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,579
then our mind Consciousness starts to

1483
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:11,400
pick up patterns and habits because of

1484
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:12,900
small bursts of PTSD developing how many

1485
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:16,400
guys

1486
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,400
how many people you know

1487
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:22,980
have PTSD around food

1488
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:25,980
post-traumatic stress around food and

1489
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,380
eating right

1490
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:31,920
because at PTSD around food and eating

1491
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:34,500
can be like in tens

1492
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,119
you eat something and you're nauseous so

1493
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,020
you identify that food is being the

1494
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:39,839
problem

1495
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:41,520
she learned to avoid that food

1496
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,960
just as you get comfortable eating

1497
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,180
another food thinking you're safe and

1498
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,619
good you get nauseous again

1499
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,780
so then that's another food you're

1500
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:50,760
uncomfortable eating suspecting it's

1501
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,400
contributing to your problem this can

1502
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,960
carry on into other Foods as well nausea

1503
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:57,780
doesn't usually receive a diagnosis

1504
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,660
besides nausea but then we end up with

1505
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,339
an eating disorder

1506
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,020
nausea doesn't usually receive a

1507
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:05,760
diagnosis besides nausea or maybe

1508
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,920
nervousness or anxiety if everything

1509
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,140
checks out okay in the abdomen it's

1510
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,380
usually passed off as someone being too

1511
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:15,599
sensitive but then we get the PTSD

1512
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,440

1513
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:21,420
