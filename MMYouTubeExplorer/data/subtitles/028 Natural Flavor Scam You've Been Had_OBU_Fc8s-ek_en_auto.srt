00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,120
for years ever since they did the

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
switcheroo the great bait and switch the

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,360
Old

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,200
bamboozle what happened was there was

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,319
something in everybody's ingredient list

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:59,599
in everything they ate it was called M

54
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:02,159
SG mono sodium glutamate you know funny

55
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,680
thing thing is is it was everywhere it

56
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:09,400
was in every single Frozen TV dinner it

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,640
was in every single Frozen dish it was

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,519
in all the restaurant Foods everywhere

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:19,920
it was in fast foods takeout but it was

60
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,959
in snack foods as well sauces dips

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,080
dressings it was in everything it was in

62
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,879

bars chocolate bars any kind of candy

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,519
really MS G was in almost everything but

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,799
here's the interesting part it was

75
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,680
listed in the ingredient list you look

76
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,360
at the back of a jar of pickles and

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,480
you'll see

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,639
MSG you look at the back of a pack of

79
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,359
cookies and you'll see MSG it was always

80
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,199
in the list it was written there the

81
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:29,120
amount of MSG was never disclosed there

82
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,280
wasn't like well 500 Mig of MSG 750 Mig

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,400
of MSG

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,800
10,000 mg of MSG the reason why it

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,639
wasn't disclosed because in different

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,520
packages different foods it would be

87
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,039
like over the top generous amounts

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,680
placed into everybody's food they were

89
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:52,039
eating and why because it made it taste

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,680
good not only taste good it made you

91
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:58,680
want to go back for more it was highly

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,080
addictive and when those neurons in your

93
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,479
brain

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,160
received that

95
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:08,560
MSG it made you remember the package you

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,880
ate it from like wow those chips are so

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,800
good I'm going back I'm going to get

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,120
another bag next time in the store

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,919
getting another bag of those chips I'm

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,240
going to grab three bags of those chips

101
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,919
and I'm going to eat one in the car on

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,080
the way home it was the Wild West a food

103
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:29,199
company can put 10,000 milligrams per

104
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,039
serving of MSG in their food another

105
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
company

106
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:39,600
might only put 200 mg another company

107
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,759
30,000 mg and the MSG industry chemical

108
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,560
companies that actually created it were

109
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:50,639
booming the food chemical industry was

110
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:53,120
taking off and MSG was the pilot light

111
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,000
and at the very same time MSG was really

112
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,400
taking off and the food chemical

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,560
industry was really taking advantage of

114
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,240
putting it in every single food for

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:06,400
everybody something else was happening

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,039
artificial flavors artificial flavoring

117
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,120
was big food chemical companies were not

118
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,759
only creating MSG synthetically but they

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,960
were creating artificial flavors

120
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,240
synthetically and artificial flavors

121
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,199
were in everything people didn't care it

122
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,160
was almost in every single food this was

123
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,840
pretty much the Golden Age of food this

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,919
is when people really didn't look at the

125
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,560
ingredient list nobody cared what was in

126
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,440
it it would be like canned the peas

127
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,199
that's all who cares it's just a can of

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,759
peas doesn't matter what's in there um

129
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,520
TV dinner doesn't matter what's in there

130
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,280
just TV dinner steak fries a little

131
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,560
dessert to TV dinner who cares what's in

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,199
there right macaroni and cheese doesn't

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,880
matter what's in there this was the

134
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,160
Golden Age It's when no one cared about

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,800
the ingredient list and the food

136
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,280
corporations knew this and they were

137
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,000
running with it and the food chemist

138
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,599
manufacturers ran with this they knew

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,199
this too nobody cared what was in the

140
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,199
food now we're moving into the 70s and

141
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,840
there were people that were

142
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,160
sensitive they realized they would get a

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
headache feel sick not feel good after

144
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,360
eating a meal this had nothing to do

145
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,720
with the health movement had nothing to

146
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,039
do with health and wellness or the

147
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,720
movement of healing this was just

148
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,520
regular people that were feeling kind of

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,800
headachy and sick and decided to look at

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,879
the back of the package these were

151
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,639
mainstream people these weren't that

152
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,319
group of people that went off the grid

153
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,960
decided to live by the land you know

154
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,639
grow their own food make their own

155
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,400
butter back to the Landers got their own

156
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,280
beans and rice going in bulk and lived

157
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,879
in nature it wasn't that crowd and it

158
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,840
wasn't the crowd that was doing aerobics

159
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,919
exercising a little bit worried about

160
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,159
Wellness to some degree that that group

161
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,560
of people either it was mainstream all

162
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:06,360
the way and they decided to look at the

163
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,840
back of the package because they weren't

164
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,319
feeling good conventional minded

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,120
everyday people that started to read the

166
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,400
back of the packages cuz they weren't

167
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,240
feeling good saw the MSG and made the

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
connection now at this point in time the

169
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,879
food chemistry manufacturing world was

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,639
in high gear with the MSG production

171
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,720
there was already a booming business

172
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,039
with it so thousands upon thousands of

173
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,200
pounds were leaving the factories and

174
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,919
heading to the food manufacturing

175
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,880
facilities MSG was booming crazy thing

176
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,640
is people were getting aware and it was

177
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,680
booming and then that collided together

178
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,279
the awareness and the booming both

179
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,240
collided the heads of the MSG

180
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,080
manufacturing world were sitting in

181
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,839
their boardroom and they were saying oh

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,640
crap we got a problem now they come a

183
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,440
long way from from where it originated

184
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,399
MSG commercial production started in

185
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,440
1909 after a Japanese Professor who was

186
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,279
a chemist figured out how to isolate

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,839
glutamate from seaweed broth commercial

188
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,600
production was about souping large Vats

189
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,040
of broth and then dehydrating the broth

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,920
so the white powder can be singled out

191
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
and then bagged up sold to restaurants

192
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,160
around the world but that was the

193
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,760
original old innocent way of doing it

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,040
that's not what we have today and it

195
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,440
wasn't what we had in the' 60s 7s and

196
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,959
80s either the old way was too expensive

197
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,399
cumbersome it was crude and it wasn't

198
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,519
even that toxic compared to where it

199
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,399
went later food chemical companies

200
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,839
didn't exist 100 years ago food

201
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,320
companies existed but not food chemical

202
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:56,399
corporations that manipulated food and

203
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,120
when these food chemical manufacturing

204
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,480
companies got wind of how addictive MSG

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,720
was they had to recreate the process in

206
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,760
an inexpensive way but potent and much

207
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,320
stronger than the original manufacturing

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,079
of MSG in 1909 in the 20th century there

209
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,800
was a conditioning with how we taste it

210
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,600
and flavored food Salt was always there

211
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,959
it was always on the table fine Pepper

212
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,279
too but this is beyond just salt and

213
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,480
pepper the flavor games began the food

214
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,600
chemical companies knew this this was

215
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,839
about ating to another flavoring and

216
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,160
another taste this was MSG other food

217
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,279
chemicals too in the artificial

218
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,959
flavorings people got used to

219
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,720
stimulation from eating cheesy crunchy

220
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,959
things that came out of a bag chips with

221
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,600
the most intense flavoring after you

222
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,200
finish up a bag you look at your

223
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,920
fingertips and they're all red and

224
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,480
orange looking with a powder on there

225
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,120
those intense flavors from the chemical

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,079
corporations they stimulate the neurons

227
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,560
that run the senses older Generations

228
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,600
that were raised on just plain old food

229
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,800
ended up learning how to eat all these

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,240
high sensory intense Flav and then

231
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,440
people now are raised on instead of old

232
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,880
plain food they're raised on these

233
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,320
intense flavors now the younger

234
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,600
Generations are highly addicted highly

235
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,519
addicted to all these chemical Food

236
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,000
flavors well I know what you're thinking

237
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,440
though you're not one of them right

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
because you're eating all the healthier

239
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,880
snacks and the healthier flavored foods

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,760
and all the good different treats that

241
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,959
seem like there's nothing bad in them

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,279
right so you're not one of the people

243
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:44,120
that are reaching their hands in those

244
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:46,880
real orangey red cheesy crunchy things

245
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,519
in the bag you're someone who is maybe

246
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
picking healthier options like in the

247
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,320
restaurants you're picking healthy

248
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
options on the menus and then when

249
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,040
you're in the store at the health market

250
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,279
health food store you're picking

251
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,160
healthier packaged foods that doesn't

252
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,760
look like it has anything bad in it or

253
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,079
maybe it's organic and not GMO and

254
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,120
you're like no that's not me I'm not

255
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,000
doing the real junky stuff the real fake

256
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,440
garbage but youve been fold in a way

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,839
that I'm going to fill you in on in a

258
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,360
little bit it's also why when someone

259
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,240
goes and eats cleaner and cleaner and

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
they're avoiding any of the packaged

261
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,560
Foods or restaurant Foods it gets really

262
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,160
boring really quick the reason you can

263
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,160
get bored really quick is because you're

264
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,959
coming off the ride you're coming off

265
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,480
the addiction you're going through

266
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,920
withdrawal you're coming off of the food

267
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,360
chemical ride it also leads to this

268
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,639
problem when someone actually stays away

269
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,040
from the food chemicals or they try to

270
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,440
clean up maybe do a cleanse a really

271
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,600
healthy one like a plain steamed potato

272
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,199
or some bananas it gets really old fast

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,000
and then you feel like you're

274
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,360
restricted it's hard to eat without all

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,240
that brain excitement that addiction the

276
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,880
food chemicals hitting all the neurons

277
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,800
it's like when you see somebody out

278
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,800
there and they get sick they get all

279
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,839
these symptoms and they have to dial it

280
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,839
back learn how to heal and maybe they'll

281
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,760
find some really good information maybe

282
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,480
they'll pick up a medical medium book

283
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,399
and they'll learn how to Mono eat for a

284
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,000
while and they'll do it and their

285
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
symptoms go away and they start healing

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,440
they get better because they've been

287
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,600
holding back all these toxic foods

288
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,959
they've been allowing their body to heal

289
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,360
they've been not feeding their pathogens

290
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,959
from all the different foods that are

291
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,240
bad for them and they're staying away

292
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,240
from all the bad flavorings and all of

293
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,480
the tricks that are inside food that

294
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,760
food chemical Industries create and then

295
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,959
they dropped their guard they got better

296
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,160
enough better enough to experience other

297
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:46,120
things again or experience the old

298
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,440
things in their old life when they were

299
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,639
sick so they go out to a restaurant they

300
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,600
order a vegan pizza maybe something that

301
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,399
has all that flavor and their mind is

302
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,240
blown their brain is just totally like

303
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,880
overloaded from those senses that

304
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,440
intense flavors back it hits every

305
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,160
single neuron it's excitement it's a

306
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,399
high and a happiness comes over and

307
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
takes over and then you hear friends and

308
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,680
family saying why can't you eat in

309
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,800
moderation why are you so restrictive

310
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,000
and you almost forget that you had a

311
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,199
restrict to heal to do the right things

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,759
to recover but now since you're better

313
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:25,000
it's like why am I eating that way why

314
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,560
should I just have a plain potato why

315
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,440
can't I just eat what I want in balance

316
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,440
in moderation

317
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,519
now you're on the addictive train again

318
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,000
the food train and then you go for

319
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,639
another vegan pizza and then you go for

320
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
another treat and then you go with a

321
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,399
chocolate bar and then you go with

322
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,680
something else a coconut ice cream and

323
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:45,000
then you go with something else and it

324
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,079
doesn't stop and now you're back on the

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,360
restaurant tour you're eating scrambled

326
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:49,920
eggs you're eating all these other

327
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,720
dishes you're eating salads with all

328
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,279
this flavoring in it and it's so easy to

329
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,399
poo poo what you did to get to this

330
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,680
place of Health where you got strong

331
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,160

better got a little bit more energy

373
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,639
you've been restricting restricting away

374
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,560
from all that flavor all those dressings

375
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240

376
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,800
combinations and then you're watching

buffalo chicken wings flavored coffee

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,680
drinks drinks with alcohol in them take

382
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,519
out every day restaurant Sandwiches and

383
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,160
you remember that things taste so much

384
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,000
better in restaurants and all your

385
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,800
friends they're getting those highs

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,439
they're excited they're excited about

387
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,880
food they're watching you with your diet

388
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,000
and they're reminding you every second

389
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,919
how you're missing out then you start

390
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,880
feeling down about yourself you start

391
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,839
thinking what am I doing why am I

392
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,959
restricting how come I can't eat like

393
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,039
everybody else but what's really

394
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,240
happening is you broke your addiction

395
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:22,559
for a little while you're not living off

396
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,839
all that flavor you went through

397
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,919
withdrawal long enough to know what it's

398
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,480
like you lost a few pounds you started

399
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:30,080
feeling a little bit better you didn't

400
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,240
didn't cheat so much and maybe you

401
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,559
didn't cheat at all for a while what's

402
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,520
really happening though is you broke

403
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,039
ownership you were owned well that's the

404
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,080
thing the flavor companies they own all

405
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,760
of us that's the whole game the flavor

406
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,640
industry wants to own everybody the

407
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,640
chemical flavor industry knows you're

408
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,679
going to lose you're going to lose the

409
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,679
battle no way you're going to be able to

410
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,000
hang in there that long they know they

411
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,480
got you they know they got everybody

412
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,880
they know that eventually you're going

413
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,280
to be peer pressured by somebody family

414
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,159
friends people you know loved ones

415
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,400
anybody co-workers and they know the day

416
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,799
is going to come and the food chemical

417
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,080
Industries think tanks you know the

418
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,840
group of people that know you better

419
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,080
than you know you sometimes those think

420
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,760
tanks no you're going to fall into that

421
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,760
whole thing of hey I'm craving it maybe

422
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,799
my body needs it this time and those

423
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,760
think tanks know you're going to fall

424
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,880
prey to that old trick I just needed a

425
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,679
little s salt I was craving a little

426
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,159
salt that's why I went with that bag of

427
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,799
chips that's why I went with that fast

428
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:39,600
food restaurant french fries but if

429
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,320
that's the case why can't you just try a

430
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,400
steamed potato plain with a Sprinkle of

431
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,120
a little salt on there no it doesn't do

432
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,880
the trick and how come homemade french

433
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,280
fries made at home baked in the oven or

434
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,039
in an air fryer just don't taste like

435
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,600
the same thing when you go through the

436
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,360
fast food restaurant and you get some

437
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,480
french fries there there because it's

438
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,760
not just salt not even homemade french

439
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,640
fries fried in oil will satisfy you like

440
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,760
a french fry somewhere in a restaurant

441
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,520
so you end up coming off the Bland train

442
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,799
and you end up cheating and then you're

443
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,080
like wow that's what I remember but it's

444
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,320
even more exciting than ever before the

445
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,880
stimulation is crazy this was amazing

446
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,960
food your adrenaline's pumping you're

447
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,760
laughing with friends you can't believe

448
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,000
how awesome the food is is and now

449
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,080
you're like why can't I do this another

450
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,880
time why am I restricting so much now

451
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,720
you're back in it with everybody else

452
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,840
you're on a train again but the think

453
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,880
tanks know that that's the whole point

454
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,000
chemical food industry knows this is

455
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,600
going to happen and they love it they

456
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
know you're going to join the losing

457
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,360
team now don't get confused with herbs

458
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and spices that's not what we're talking

459
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,000

and it's like I'm happy again I'm happy

478
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,000
like what was I doing what was I

479
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,799
thinking isn't there such thing as

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,840
moderation and balance

481
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,440
yeah yeah I was talking to this coach

482
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,600
and the coach said that I can just eat

483
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,960
what I want and still be happy but I'm

484
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,000
trying to remember didn't I start eating

485
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,840
really clean because and started eating

486
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,200
really like fresh and no junk and

487
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,520
garbage and no processed foods because I

488
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
wasn't feeling good right and I had

489
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,039
weight while I lost a few pounds yeah

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,480
and now I feel like I can just start

491
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,600
fresh oh my God this is so good I could

492
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,320
do this like every day right now I know

493
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,080
some people think they've escaped it all

494
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,120
because they've figured out intermittent

495
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,840
fasting for a while in their life and

496
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,799
they're not a part of all this flavored

497
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,279
game but it's actually the opposite

498
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,799
they're doing the flavored chemical

499
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,440
coffee drinks all day long and then at

500
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,600
the end of the day they're eating

501
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,080
anything their heart desires cuz they

502
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,960
starve thems all day long and how do you

503
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,120
get vanilla flavored coffee when there's

504
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,679
no real vanilla in there and then when

505
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,360
you eat you eat anything you want and

506
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,559
they take pride in the fact that they

507
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,159
can eat what they want and do eat what

508
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,559
they want but that really means they

509
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,200
really haven't escaped the whole that

510
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,400
the food chemical companies have on them

511
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,799
and then there's the athletes out there

512
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,559
that work really hard with their

513
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,159
athletic work and after they're done

514
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,400
they award themselves with their

515
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,880
favorite food like donuts or bagels or

516
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,240
something cheesy usually something from

517
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,600
their favorite restaurant and what's

518
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,279
incredible is that these athletes

519
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,600
they're in good shape they look amazing

520
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,480
they're working hard everybody aspires

521
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,960
to be like them but at the same time

522
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,799
they're trap too and the chemical

523
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,200
industry the food chemical industry

524
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,159
knows this and when you talk to an

525
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,279
athlete they'll tell you it's about

526
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,039
balance and moderation and that's why

527
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,919
they do it too they love their favorite

528
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,159
foods they feel like they earned it they

529
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,520
ran 20 miles they burned off all those

530
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,000
calories why not eat our favorite Donuts

531
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:54,200
now but the funny thing is the food

532
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,400
chemical industry created the term

533
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,799
balance and moderation they created it

534
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,320
with the the pharmaceutical companies so

535
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:04,760
that people go you know what I can have

536
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,480
a little bit more of that toxic crap the

537
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,080
industry pushed and promoted the balance

538
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,960
of moderation narrative so that you

539
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,720
would buy more chips and cookies and

540
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,120
donuts and package food and drinks and

541
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,200
restaurant food and any other foods from

542
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,080
other food companies that they've sold

543
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,520
their chemical additives to so let's go

544
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,000
back to the Collision where the food

545
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,039
chemical industry realized ocean it and

546
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,559
people in the mainstream realized

547
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:38,440
something's bad in these products the

548
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:41,520
moment enough people realized MSG was

549
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,400
doing something to them the moment they

550
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,400
realized it was on the label and the

551
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,760
moment they realized it was actually

552
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,080
toxic in causing a problem the MSG

553
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,039
realizations the MSG realization from

554
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,200
the food chemical industry too where

555
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,720
they're like oh my God they're figuring

556
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,720
it out they're finding out what do we do

557
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:11,480
the food chemical industry said to

558
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,840
itself if we don't keep this stuff tasty

559
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,919
addictive we're going to lose a lot of

560
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,159
sales and the effect was going to happen

561
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,640
from the highest part of the food chain

562
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,039
down to the lowest part of the food

563
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
chain the chemical manufacturing

564
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,880
facilities which is the highest part of

565
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,279
the food chain that were producing all

566
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,559
of that MSG plus artificial flavoring

567
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,720
and other kind of food chemicals too

568
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,159
they were going to take a big hit

569
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,360
because they were the ones that were

570
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,799
selling all of that product all of that

571
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,760
MSG to the other food corporations the

572
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:43,600
food corporations that sell all the soft

573
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,279
drinks and the drinks and the package

574
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,559
foods and the bagged and packaged snacks

575
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,279
and the next line on the food chain was

576
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,600
the food chains meaning the restaurant

577
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,760
business restaurant chains fast food

578
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,520
they purchased all that MSG and all the

579
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,200
other food chemicals too and were

580
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,200
putting in it in all their chain

581
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,440
restaurant Delights and tasty dishes but

582
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,760
it didn't stop there and then all the

583
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,559
other food businesses food companies

584
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,760
that bottled and canned things they

585
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,279
purchased the MSG and other food

586
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,080
chemicals to put in all their different

587
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,279
things you find on the Shelf all the

588
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,200
bottled stuff all the Jarred pickles

589
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,360
Jarred olives Jarred artichokes all the

590
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,480
different jellies and jams mayos

591
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,240
mustards ketchups dressings and then the

592
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,960
next stop on the food chain Candy World

593
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,520
chocolate bars candy bars all of those

594
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,399
packed with MSG and then the next part

595
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,399
of the food chain dropping down to the

596
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,720
mom and pop stores mom and pop

597
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:48,320
restaurants where it's condiments in

598
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:51,440
bulk soy sauces vinegars tomato sauces

599
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,880
peanut oil canola oil olive oil MSU was

600
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,960
added to those bulk oils this was the

601
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
wholesale market and this is the

602
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,880
wholesale Market that was fed to the mom

603
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,679
and pop stores and restaurants all laced

604
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,760
with MSG the entire food chain business

605
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,600
was infested with MSG and contaminated

606
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,399
with food chemicals from the highest

607
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:22,919
Echelon and beneath then the word got

608
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:26,360
out MSG was toxic it was bad and then it

609
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,399
disappeared like a ghost ship in the

610
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,679
night the letters

611
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,440
MSG disappeared off of all the labels

612
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,000
all the labels in the food World changed

613
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:43,039
but the recipe stayed the same emergency

614
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,559
action was taken by the food chemical

615
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,159
industry which was illegal because the

616
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,919
word MSG monosodium glutamate was

617
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,240
removed off of all the labels of every

618
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,080
single food in the industry but yet MSG

619
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,480
was still in the food all the same and

620
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,600
then people got wise though they still

621
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,760
weren't feeling good and so individuals

622
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,320
looked into the products and were

623
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,039
looking and searching for MSG it was

624
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,039
still there this was during a time when

625
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,799
food Chemical Testing was approachable

626
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:20,120
the Layman can get food tested for

627
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:23,039
Basics and actually see results a small

628
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,360
window in time before the food chemical

629
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,480
industry to control over almost

630
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,880
everything when when the food chemical

631
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,080
industry joined forces with big Pharma

632
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,240
and determined what we allowed to truly

633
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,919
see in our food and drugs and for the

634
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,840
short moment of time in our history

635
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,480
added MSG was no longer there it was

636
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:51,120
removed it wasn't in the food anymore it

637
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,399
disappeared but then it reappeared under

638
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,919
different names different tags different

639
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,240
ingredient words private deals were made

640
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,399
behind the scenes with these

641
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,200
organizations private deals

642
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,200
grandfathered in that you're never

643
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,399
allowed to know the MSG found its way

644
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,880
back into the food under code names

645
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,799
yeast artificial flavors fermented

646
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,679
products fermented foods soy products

647
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,600
Protein Isolate and so many more but

648
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:25,720
there's a big one really scary one it's

649
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,080
natural flavoring natural flavors why is

650
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,559
it scary one reason

651
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,880
it's so deceiving it's really a trick

652
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:37,519
out it's natural all natural natural is

653
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,720
great natural's good natural can be in

654
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,080
any organic food it can be in any

655
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,840
product that's healthy for you and all

656
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,480
the people that wanted food transparency

657
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,559
like they wanted transparency of what

658
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,679
they're eating what they're feeding

659
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,200
their children they think they're

660
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:56,240
getting that transparency natural

661
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,000
flavors what could go wrong think about

662
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,919
all the people in the health world World

663
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,600
Health and Wellness World they care

664
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,360
about what they're putting in their body

665
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,440
they look at everything they read

666
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:10,320
everything moms buy juice boxes juice

667
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,000
boxes say apple juice and then natural

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,279
flavors underneath it almost every

669
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,640
single health food out there has natural

670
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,880
flavors in it one way or another

671
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,760
including supplements any kind of

672
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,240
supplementation you'll see natural

673
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,640
flavors in there now here's where it

674
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
gets really confusing you'll see organic

675
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,039
natural flavors

676
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,880
still the same thing we're going to talk

677
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:37,240
about that in a minute organic flavoring

678
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,399
organic vanilla flavor vanilla flavoring

679
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:43,279
vanilla flavors Berry flavor organic

680
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,640
Berry flavor any kind of natural

681
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,880
flavoring but it doesn't stop there it

682
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,080
might say fruit flavoring or it might

683
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,720
say caramel flavoring or it might say

684
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,919
something else but it never stops

685
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,559
there's so many different versions and

686
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,679
different types of flavors and then the

687
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,120
individual fruit names or vegetable

688
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,039
names it'll be like Blackberry flavoring

689
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,600
raspberry flavoring and then you think

690
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,159
it's just a raspberry that was put in

691
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,960
there but it's not just because you hear

692
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,640
the word natural flavors and then you

693
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,919
read the package and you're like well it

694
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,360
doesn't say natural flavors on here it

695
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,919
says poisonberry or Blackberry flavoring

696
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,440
or fruit flavoring I'm off the hook

697
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,960
everything's okay it's not natural

698
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,919
flavors but you're not off the hook it's

699
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,399
not okay it's all the same but at the

700
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,799
same time it's so different so let's

701
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,279
talk about that what I mean by that is

702
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,399
every time you see a flavoring of any

703
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,039
kind in a product there could be 200

704
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,080
different ingredients within that

705
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:45,720
flavoring 400 ingredients 1,000

706
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,039
ingredients 100 ingredients it could be

707
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,480
anything and that's the whole point it's

708
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,840
like the fragrance world it's a secret

709
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,399
you don't get to choose or know what is

710
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,720
inside the product it's like perfume

711
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:04,120
perfume fragrance cologne you'll never

712
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,559
know a thousand ingredients many of them

713
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,720
toxic sitting inside of it and you don't

714
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,639
know about it natural flavors is like

715
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,760
the perfume perfume fragrance world of

716
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:15,919
food and you thought you're getting

717
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,840
transparency full transparency of your

718
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,880
health food you're in the store you're

719
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,360
in an organic market you're in a Foods

720
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,000
Market you see some healthy snacks some

721
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,360
healthy drinks and little do you know

722
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,679
you got MSG in your or drink in your

723
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,799
snack it's in the natural flavor along

724
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,039
with many other chemicals you don't know

725
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,360
about that are in the natural flavorings

726
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,519
now why would natural flavors or natural

727
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,200
flavoring of any kind have MSG in it if

728
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,760
you look into MSG you'll see out there

729
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,320
that it has to be listed in an

730
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,720
ingredient list on a food product so if

731
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,960
you want to choose to use MSG to flavor

732
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,200
your food it has to be listed in the

733
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,720
ingredient list but what people don't

734
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,600
realize is there's a workaround for

735
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,200
example if you're a food company and you

736
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,279
want to produce a tasty food product and

737
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,559
you want to buy and purchase isolated

738
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,440
mono sodium glutamate to make it taste

739
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,200
good you can you can purchase it and

740
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,080
then you can add it to your ingredient

741
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,159
list but you have to have the

742
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,159
transparency you have to say mono sodium

743
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,360
glutamate in your food product

744
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,960
ingredient list but if you're a

745
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,960
health-minded person and you see it in

746
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,440
the ingredient list mono sodium

747
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,880
glutamate you may not choose to purchase

748
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,559
that product so the workaround comes

749
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,480
like this the food company can purchase

750
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:39,039
natural flavors natural flavors can go

751
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,840
into the food snack or food product you

752
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,200
don't have to list monosodium glutamate

753
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,039
it's in the natural flavors food

754
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,679
chemists that work for the food chemical

755
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:51,159
industry create the natural flavors they

756
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,720
add the MSG into the natural flavors

757
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,960
along with a whole bunch of other

758
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,440
chemicals then they sell those natural

759
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,679
flavorings to food manufacturer ing

760
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,639
companies if you have a package of

761
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,039
snacks that you like and they're a

762
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:07,440
healthy package of snacks and GMO free

763
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,760
the whole bit gluten-free and you see

764
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,720
natural flavors in there and you call

765
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,080
the company and say what's in your

766
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,080
natural

767
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,200
flavors hello super erer duper healthy

768
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,360
Sac Delights Incorporated how can I help

769
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,360
you yeah um anyway I got your package

770
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,000
right here and I just have a question it

771
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,919
says natural

772
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,799
flavoring yeah and it say natural

773
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,320
flavoring and I'm just want to clear

774
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,799
this up for a second cuz I'm thinking

775
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:41,159
what is that like what's in the natural

776
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:43,240
flavoring our snack foods are non- GMO

777
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,919
they're grain-free they're gluten-free

778
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,480
and the best there is out there so

779
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,080
what's your question again

780
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,679
sir the the natural flavorings is it

781
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,720
possible something else is in the

782
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,120
natural flavorings because what is

783
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:03,919
natural flavorings do you know

784
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:06,519
M hm I think I really don't I can't

785
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,599
answer that right now I can get back to

786
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:11,200
you though what's your phone number the

787
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:13,320
thing is no one will ever know no one's

788
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,560
supposed to know it's not meant for

789
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,560
anybody to know that's the whole point

790
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,240
it's a way for the industry to sneak in

791
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,879
anything they want to sneak in now we're

792
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,520
highlighting MSG but there's a whole

793
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,639
bunch of other chemicals getting snuck

794
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,280
into those natural flavors but there's

795
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,560
good reason to highlight MSG because

796
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,119
it's really that bad now there's a lot

797
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,280
of gaslighting going on about MSG out

798
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,720
there you'll hear about it it's not so

799
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,560
bad for us after all there's really no

800
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,839
harmful effects there's no evidence or

801
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,399
data there's no proof clinics are even

802
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:48,639
saying well there's really no proof that

803
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,599
MSG has harmed anyone so you can

804
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,800
actually have it in moderation why not

805
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,399
no one's really getting hurt by it now

806
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,919
here's the big one they hang their hat

807
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,040
on right here they'll say mono sodium

808
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:02,960
glutamate is naturally occurring in all

809
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,480
your Foods Dairy meat fruits vegetables

810
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,640
and this is where they're totally wrong

811
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,960
if you have an organic non-GMO cherry

812
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,240
tomato in your hand they will say that

813
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,480
there's naturally occurring MSG inside

814
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,560
that tomato this is not true to begin

815
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,480
with your cherry tomato is organic it's

816
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,079
non GMO you have to remember that what

817
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,560
you'll find in that tomato is naturally

818
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,920
occurring glutamic acid in traces not

819
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
the mono sodium glutamate additive

820
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,680
that's used in the industry the thing

821
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,040
that's added to the food that's isolated

822
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,640
and synthesized highly concentrated and

823
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,800
GMO if a supplement product or food

824
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,200
product says non GMO but has natural

825
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,119
flavors in the ingredient list and those

826
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,400
natural flavors are comprised with a lot

827
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:56,160
of different chemicals and additives

828
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:00,319
that are derived from GMO sources is the

829
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,400
product now truly non- GMO or because

830
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:06,960
the natural flavors has GMO chemicals in

831
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,480
there it's truly not a non-GMO product

832
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,480
but in defense of supplement product

833
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,240
companies and food product companies

834
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,359
they just don't know no one's telling

835
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,040
those people who own and run those

836
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:23,119
companies that natural flavoring is GMO

837
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,480
or natural flavoring has a lot of MSG in

838
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,480
it or natural flavors and natural

839
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,720
flavoring has 100 200 300 500 different

840
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,960
chemicals in it if you see a drink or a

841
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,319
packaged food that has say 10

842
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,960
ingredients in it and it's wholesome and

843
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:42,119
the ingredients look clean and good but

844
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,640
you see an additional ingredient called

845
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,119
natural flavorings or natural flavors or

846
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,280
just plain flavors or raspberry flavor

847
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,599
vanilla flavor or any kind of flavor

848
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,200
flavoring then in true reality you're

849
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,720
not dealing with 10 ingredients you're

850
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,160
dealing with at least an 11th which is

851
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,319
MSG but here's the crazy part you're

852
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,960
really dealing with 100 more or maybe

853
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:07,520
200 more or even more than that could

854
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,160
even be a thousand no one would ever

855
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,359
know so really instead of 10 ingredients

856
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,760
on that package there should be a list a

857
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,960
mile long on that package names you

858
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,920
can't even believe and that's the

859
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,359
workaround and that's how everybody's

860
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,040
being played as the years go on anything

861
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,119
could be put into those natural

862
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,240
flavorings and natural flavors and then

863
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,079
put into your food no one would ever

864
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,200
know the MSG of today is different than

865
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,480
the MSG years ago decades ago and the

866
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,040
MSG decades ago was different than the

867
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,280
MSG originally discovered back in 1908

868
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:47,680
the MSG now is produced and created out

869
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:52,720
of GMO sugar beads GMO corn GMO molasses

870
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:56,200
making MSG GMO and then that MSG is

871
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,480
added to a natural flavor mix whether

872
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,760
it's or organic natural flavors or

873
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,680
natural flavorings or vanilla natural

874
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,160
flavor it's added to that now it's a GMO

875
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,440
product then those natural flavors get

876
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,119
put into a package of organic food

877
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,000
organic food label says n GMO but now it

878
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,720
is GMO and here's an interesting thing

879
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,359
MSG isn't just MSG anymore by itself

880
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,079
sure they derive it from GMO sources

881
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:28,240
like the GMO corn GMO sugar beets and

882
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,839
other GMO products but they also add

883
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,960
different chemicals to it now so it's

884
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,160
not just MSG by itself it's MSG with

885
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,040
other chemicals added to it and it's

886
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,760
random you won't know what kind of MSG

887
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,319
you even get some MSG is just plain old

888
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,640
just sugar beads that are actually GMO

889
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,440
gmoe corn it's dry from it and you just

890
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,520
get the MSG mixed into those natural

891
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,359
flavors and some MSG will have that plus

892
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,720
chemicals but it's all random and it's

893
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,880
all bad and then when you think it's bad

894
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,599
enough there's different forms of MSG

895
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,839
there's a cloned version where it's all

896
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,800
synthetic what this means is the

897
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,960
original was made off of GMO sugar beets

898
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,560
or GMO molasses GMO corn but chemical

899
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,920
companies found cheaper ways of doing it

900
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,400
cloning it cloning the building blocks

901
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,280
of GMO corn GMO sugar beat versions of

902
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,960
MSG creating an identical synthetic

903
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:27,599
compound and calling it MSG and then

904
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:30,240
that sold to food companies and put into

905
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,560
the natural flavors and then those

906
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,440
natural flavors get put into your ice

907
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,880
creams your drinks your snacks your

908
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,800
cereals your supplements and then little

909
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,400
juice boxes that your kids drink it was

910
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,400
the ultimate baat and switch it was an

911
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,920
invasion natural flavors became an

912
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,119
invasion into our food supply without

913
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,400
your consent nobody ever asked you hey

914
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,200
everybody do you want this crap in your

915
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
food sad thing is you're not even going

916
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,920
to taste the real flavor of what the

917
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,240
food was because they added all their

918
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,560
chemical natural flavors in so if it was

919
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,480
apple juice you're not going to taste

920
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,359
the apple juice to the natural way it

921
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,119
would be you're going to taste their

922
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
concoction they added into the apple

923
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,240
juice the thing is there's all these

924
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,640
people out there that pride in how they

925
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,200
eat they pride in what they avoid too

926
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,839
like they avoid fast foods or processed

927
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,960
foods they think they escaped the

928
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,319
conventional machine but they didn't the

929
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,400
conventional evil machine still has

930
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,920
their hands in your Pure Food so let's

931
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,000
head back to the MSG why is it bad well

932
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,000
conventional world says right now like

933
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,800
don't worry about it clinics even say

934
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,119
hey it's not really causing a problem

935
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,160
with anybody something not to be alarmed

936
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,119
about there isn't enough studies we

937
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,000
don't really see anything we haven't

938
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,160
seen anybody really get hurt by it so

939
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,440
maybe you don't have to worry about it

940
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,040
but how would they know science of

941
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,640
research doesn't know why anybody sick

942
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,839
still to this day they don't have the

943
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,040
technology to know why at the same time

944
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,560
chronic illness is exploding out there

945
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,839
especially neurological conditions and

946
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,480
disorders I'm not saying that all the

947
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,160
chronic illness of today is because of

948
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,640
MSG but I am saying they figured out

949
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,880
years ago decades ago that the MSG was

950
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,720
bothering people giving them migraines

951
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,440
making them dizzy giving them

952
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,560
neurological symptoms and then they

953
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
backtracked they papered it all up

954
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,960
doesn't exist it's not happening they

955
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,240
rewrote history like they do all too

956
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,520
often so let's go back a little ways

957
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,880
when people first started complaining

958
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,480
about problems that they identified with

959
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:44,599
MSG first of all your doctor could not

960
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,920
identify why the MSG was causing a

961
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:49,319
symptom or a problem they didn't have

962
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,920
the technology to diagnose it and they

963
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:54,000
still don't today which is why they can

964
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,640
rewrite history right now and tell you

965
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,040
well we don't know what the effects are

966
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,240
and we don't think think there is any

967
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,920
problems MSG really isn't an issue like

968
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:05,359
we maybe thought before but let's talk

969
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:09,520
about the truth to begin with MSG isn't

970
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,200
the cause of somebody having OCD bipolar

971
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,280
depression anxiety but it can help

972
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,880
worsen it and MSG is not the cause of

973
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,319
severe migraines or the cause of other

974
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,920
symptoms and conditions that are severe

975
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,400
but it can worsen the symptoms here's

976
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,839
why MSG could be a problem it can build

977
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,880
up inside the brain over time deposits

978
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,880
of MSG can build up around neurons

979
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,520
dampening electrical impulses neurons in

980
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,800
neurotransmitter activity so if anybody

981
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,760
has a problem like toxic heavy metals in

982
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,040
their brain or lowgrade viral infections

983
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,720
or high-grade viral infections chronic

984
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,520
illness autoimmune there already is a

985
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,440
compromise going on between the

986
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,440
pathogens the metals and toxins

987
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,599
somebody's dealing with or brain

988
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,599
inflammation that somebody is dealing

989
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,920
with MSG can be the straw that breaks

990
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,640
the Campbell's back all these problems

991
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,160
are happening MSG deposits are building

992
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,640
we have more issues now with the brain

993
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,520
this way if somebody's already sensitive

994
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,839
from metals and pathogens and other

995
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,640
issues then they're going to be

996
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,599
sensitive to the MSG if someone doesn't

997
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,920
have any big health problems they don't

998
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,440
have any symptoms or conditions yet and

999
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,280
they go through life ingesting a lot of

1000
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,040
MSG along the way it keeps building up

1001
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,200
over time and eventually the MSG

1002
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,359
deposits that build up on the neurons

1003
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:36,839
become a weakness I talk in great detail

1004
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,839
about this in the brains saver

1005
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,920
books H my favorite snack bars let me

1006
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,440
see this what flavors do they

1007
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,319
have ooh strawberry and

1008
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,440
almond o raspberry and macadamia nut let

1009
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,720
me read the

1010
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,640
back what's this natural flavors thing

1011
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,000
oh that's right right I remember that

1012
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:05,480
stuff's bad putting this

1013
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,359
back the word natural isn't safe space

1014
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,599
anymore it never was the lines are

1015
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:16,359
blurred always have been there is

1016
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:19,240
treachery in the stores natural can mean

1017
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:22,680
anything at this point in the world not

1018
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,319
even good old non GMO is sketched in

1019
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,480
stone nor

1020
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:29,359
secure what we see with our own eyes

1021
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,880
isn't all that's cracked up to being

1022
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,280
known and what we can't see with our

1023
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:37,559
eyes is in a leag of its own words can

1024
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,359
have different meanings when it comes

1025
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:42,960
down to our health there's a lot of bad

1026
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:46,599
still out there in our way when it comes

1027
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,839
to healing and who knows it's still so

1028
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:51,800
confusing and sad when you think about

1029
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,720
the tricks in games played on the ones

1030
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:58,040
by the bad who take care of their health

1031
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,200
the most but they've been had and as we

1032
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:03,160
walk down the food aisles filling our

1033
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,359
baskets with wholesome options and have

1034
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,000
no idea why corruption somehow found its

1035
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,319
way into the door of the natural and

1036
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,720
even organic food stores how strange it

1037
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,680
all really is that the back of the

1038
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,280
bottle or package has a mysterious word

1039
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,839
puzzle that most everyone

1040
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,520
ignores sometimes it's even on the lid

1041
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,119
it's time we become aware about the

1042
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:33,400
flavors that make the food tastes less

1043
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,640
Bland and so bizarre so many pride in

1044
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,079
themselves when it comes to taking care

1045
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,000
of their health and they think about

1046
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,240
everything that enters their mouth

1047
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,280
because they're all told health is

1048
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,680
wealth at the same time something is

1049
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,800
hidden and completely stealth

1050
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,240
interfering with your self-care and your

1051
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,040
self-help when it comes to these small

1052
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,599
little words hiding deep within the

1053
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:05,880
labels we seem to trust the ones that

1054
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,880
control our taste buds and tell us
