[246.88 - 251.40] it have you noticed have you noticed the
[250.32 - 255.60] new
[251.40 - 257.68] war I mean they're armed with demons the
[255.60 - 260.16] goal is to take down the vegan movement
[257.68 - 264.32] have you seen it and so what happened
[260.16 - 268.80] was as the in the last few years as the
[264.32 - 270.72] carnivore world started to rise up they
[268.80 - 273.64] got crafted
[270.72 - 275.36] so the meat eater guys the dudes that
[273.64 - 276.76] started hitting social right they
[275.36 - 279.00] started hitting social and they're like
[276.76 - 281.20] you know what we're going to take down
[279.00 - 282.76] that vegan crap we're going to take down
[281.20 - 284.56] veganism we're going to take down the
[282.76 - 287.64] plant-based movement and we're going to
[284.56 - 291.24] search to chip away at the Men start you
[287.64 - 294.44] know calling them weak calling them
[291.24 - 295.76] frail you know calling them feminized
[294.44 - 299.00] that's one of the things that happened
[295.76 - 300.16] so it was an incredible technique in war
[299.00 - 303.76] and so the
[300.16 - 306.00] the the animal-based movement the new
[303.76 - 308.24] animal based movement which is basically
[306.00 - 309.40] Atkins but then turned into something a
[308.24 - 312.12] little different we're going to go into
[309.40 - 313.36] that in detail too basically it's the
[312.12 - 316.08] Akin
[313.36 - 319.00] diet without some of the garbage in some
[316.08 - 322.00] of the junk and then it's rangle and
[319.00 - 326.40] repackaged into it's like the Atkins
[322.00 - 327.68] movement the paleo diet movement both
[326.40 - 331.40] ref
[327.68 - 336.16] finagled reclaimed and turned into this
[331.40 - 340.48] new version this mutation of carnivore
[336.16 - 343.40] and keto and then dudes rose out of it
[340.48 - 346.52] on social that's what happened they rose
[343.40 - 348.72] out of it ready to slay and that's
[346.52 - 351.16] really what happened and they're like
[348.72 - 353.48] we're going to slay those vegans and
[351.16 - 355.84] those plant-based people and we're going
[353.48 - 358.24] to use all kinds of techniques we're
[355.84 - 360.64] going to tell women that they can't be
[358.24 - 362.32] fertile without meat that's the first
[360.64 - 364.84] thing so all these women that were
[362.32 - 366.04] plant-based and vegan and went there
[364.84 - 368.52] because they weren't feeling well and
[366.04 - 370.24] they weren't feeling sick decided like
[368.52 - 373.16] wait a minute here I'm not going to be
[370.24 - 375.68] fertile infertility is going to happen
[373.16 - 378.24] I'm seeing dudes that are looking pretty
[375.68 - 380.56] good on social they're talking about hey
[378.24 - 382.60] if I stay vegan If I Stay plant-based if
[380.56 - 384.92] I'm not eating meat I'm not going to
[382.60 - 387.08] keep my hormones balanced I'm going to
[384.92 - 388.92] have fertility issues I'm not going to
[387.08 - 390.16] be able to have a baby when I meet the
[388.92 - 391.48] right guy
[390.16 - 393.04] you know something like that so what's
[391.48 - 394.84] happening and basically that's what it
[393.04 - 398.12] is that's what's happening out there
[394.84 - 400.24] basically so a lot of women were falling
[398.12 - 401.84] from Grace vegans were falling from
[400.24 - 404.08] Grace so they would do all their posts
[401.84 - 405.88] and all their social media posts and
[404.08 - 408.28] they would say hey they would start out
[405.88 - 411.68] like look you know my symptoms are kind
[408.28 - 414.76] of coming back I've been you know vegan
[411.68 - 417.36] for quite a while I gave it a year now
[414.76 - 419.84] I'm kind of incorporating some raw milk
[417.36 - 422.84] now I'm incorporating you know back to
[419.84 - 425.32] some raw eggs or back to eggs or raw
[422.84 - 427.04] eggs now I'm incorporating some meat now
[425.32 - 428.80] and so their whole their whole platform
[427.04 - 431.64] would be like wait a minute you had us
[428.80 - 433.48] on this vegan ride for a year and now
[431.64 - 434.96] you're telling us that you know our
[433.48 - 436.52] hormones aren't really going to be
[434.96 - 437.84] balanced and all these women are like
[436.52 - 440.24] now you're telling us we're not going to
[437.84 - 442.12] be fertile now you're telling us that
[440.24 - 444.28] you're Switching gears and you're eating
[442.12 - 446.92] eggs and you're eating meat and that's
[444.28 - 449.16] what I should do and then the protein
[446.92 - 452.44] scare the reinvention of the protein
[449.16 - 455.68] scare developed where once again all
[452.44 - 457.76] these dudes rising up on social all
[455.68 - 459.44] trying to say Hey you know like let's
[457.76 - 461.80] take out the vegans let's take out the
[459.44 - 464.84] plant-based people let's hit them with
[461.80 - 467.20] the protein fears again let's feed that
[464.84 - 469.60] back on people amino acids proteins
[467.20 - 472.56] let's feed all of that back on people
[469.60 - 474.56] and then things like choline choline
[472.56 - 476.36] choline you need choline you're not
[474.56 - 478.60] going to get that you need the right
[476.36 - 481.84] vitamins you need iron right back to
[478.60 - 484.28] those old f years that our grandmothers
[481.84 - 486.20] had right that are grandmothers had back
[484.28 - 488.28] to some of those like iron right that
[486.20 - 490.60] one too now you need to be eating liver
[488.28 - 492.76] now you need to be eating beef organs
[490.60 - 495.08] now you need to be eating hearts and
[492.76 - 497.44] that's what you should be doing so this
[495.08 - 499.60] movement's growing and growing and it
[497.44 - 501.28] it's been the last four years but
[499.60 - 503.36] getting a little heavier and a little
[501.28 - 505.64] heavier and so the vegans and the
[503.36 - 508.52] plant-based people have been dropping
[505.64 - 510.00] like flies mostly the women just
[508.52 - 511.80] dropping like flies
[510.00 - 513.52] getting scared because they don't
[511.80 - 515.88] understand their symptoms and they're
[513.52 - 518.28] just getting the minute a vegan person
[515.88 - 520.76] or a plant-based person gets a symptom
[518.28 - 521.80] boom they're like now they're doubting
[520.76 - 523.28] everything they're doubting the
[521.80 - 525.20] plant-based thing and then they hear
[523.28 - 527.60] dudes that are working out in the gym
[525.20 - 528.64] and training and they're on social and
[527.60 - 531.88] they're sitting there and they're
[528.64 - 533.92] ripping apart soy boys and stuff and
[531.88 - 537.08] they're making you know women feel like
[533.92 - 539.92] their men are weak and fragile and just
[537.08 - 541.84] they're soy boys and they're feminine in
[539.92 - 543.80] and then they get told it's all out
[541.84 - 546.28] there that if you're plant-based as a
[543.80 - 548.52] dude you're feminized and so that's
[546.28 - 550.40] another thing too so a whole massive
[548.52 - 552.28] campaign of bullying has been coming
[550.40 - 554.76] down on the vegans and the plant-based
[552.28 - 557.24] people right so I don't know if you guys
[554.76 - 559.44] have seen it but it's been happening so
[557.24 - 562.32] all the dudes are being they're all
[559.44 - 564.80] called soy boys now right they're all
[562.32 - 565.96] feminized and so a lot of women are like
[564.80 - 568.52] wait a minute I'm not going to get
[565.96 - 571.36] fertile I'm going to have infertility my
[568.52 - 574.76] dude is you know he's feminized my
[571.36 - 576.96] dude's a soy boy this doesn't look good
[574.76 - 579.40] I got you know so what's happening is
[576.96 - 581.16] this war has been really really smart in
[579.40 - 584.20] a lot of ways to take down the vegan and
[581.16 - 586.68] plant-based movement and it did I'm
[584.20 - 590.56] sorry but it did it pretty much
[586.68 - 592.68] slaughtered it okay I I believe from
[590.56 - 595.72] what I can see and tell and information
[592.68 - 597.72] that I get above and all in the above
[595.72 - 600.96] that the vegan movement was
[597.72 - 604.76] bigger at at a around
[600.96 - 606.64] pre-2000 than it is today right now the
[604.76 - 609.52] plant-based movement and the vegan
[606.64 - 612.60] movement was bigger a little bit pre
[609.52 - 615.52] 2000 than it is right now so this is
[612.60 - 617.24] something to think about okay now if you
[615.52 - 619.08] just got on here you're thinking wait a
[617.24 - 620.68] minute wait a minute how you know how
[619.08 - 622.84] does this work medical M information
[620.68 - 625.04] medical M information is not against
[622.84 - 628.28] plant-based it's not against veganism
[625.04 - 630.16] it's not against animal protein it's not
[628.28 - 631.56] against people that want to keto or
[630.16 - 633.88] whatever they want to eat animal
[631.56 - 635.80] products instead it's these powerful
[633.88 - 638.68] tools that you can incorporate and then
[635.80 - 641.32] you can learn what to avoid as a
[638.68 - 643.52] plant-based person as a vegan person as
[641.32 - 646.44] an animal person as a keto person
[643.52 - 648.44] whatever it is things you can avoid so
[646.44 - 649.72] you can take your healing to the next
[648.44 - 651.80] level that's what medical medium
[649.72 - 654.00] information always was and people used
[651.80 - 657.00] to ask me all the time plant-based
[654.00 - 659.00] doctors used to reach out to me some
[657.00 - 663.56] I've known some I didn't know and would
[659.00 - 666.36] say are you a plant-based book or not I
[663.56 - 669.00] saw your book in the bookstore it wasn't
[666.36 - 671.52] with all the plantbased people what is
[669.00 - 673.72] going on aw what are you and what are
[671.52 - 676.08] you not I'm like why does it have to be
[673.72 - 679.28] that way my books are fill the tools you
[676.08 - 682.56] can apply for both right there for both
[679.28 - 685.00] meat animal you know plant-based the
[682.56 - 687.24] whole bit and so there's always been two
[685.00 - 689.40] sides of the aisle two sides of the
[687.24 - 691.28] aisle you guys know this right you're
[689.40 - 692.92] either plant if you want to call it
[691.28 - 694.80] veganism because you're you don't want
[692.92 - 698.48] to wear leather shoes and you don't want
[694.80 - 701.36] to eat honey it's either plant and vegan
[698.48 - 704.00] or animal and that animal can be in any
[701.36 - 708.20] form Atkins
[704.00 - 711.72] paleo um keto uh carnivore whatever it's
[708.20 - 713.60] either plant-based vegan or animal those
[711.72 - 717.00] are the two sides of the aisle that's
[713.60 - 718.24] how the game's been played but in the
[717.00 - 721.44] last few
[718.24 - 722.40] years the vegans and the plant-base have
[721.44 - 725.84] been
[722.40 - 728.64] slaughtered slaughtered they have the
[725.84 - 730.92] amount of animal protein doctors coming
[728.64 - 733.84] out of the woodwork going on social
[730.92 - 736.80] waging you know War campaigns the amount
[733.84 - 738.88] of the amount of influencers that are
[736.80 - 741.04] dudes that are just worried about their
[738.88 - 743.80] masculinity and just you know trying to
[741.04 - 745.52] say you got to eat meat and you know and
[743.80 - 748.60] and the dudes that are plant-based are
[745.52 - 751.32] just weak and you know frail and they're
[748.60 - 754.04] thin and and all this stuff and so
[751.32 - 755.92] they've really done a number and then
[754.04 - 758.88] you know that wasn't totally enough to
[755.92 - 761.88] push women out of veganism to push women
[758.88 - 763.96] out of plant-base the key was you're not
[761.88 - 765.56] going to be fertile your reproductive
[763.96 - 767.00] system is going to dry up you're going
[765.56 - 769.16] to have infertility if you're
[767.00 - 771.64] plant-based you're not going to be able
[769.16 - 773.40] to have a baby that was the kicker right
[771.64 - 776.72] there your hormones aren't going to be
[773.40 - 781.52] balanced properly balanced that was the
[776.72 - 784.76] nail in the coffin right there so the
[781.52 - 787.20] Meat Heads okay they did a good one with
[784.76 - 788.64] that one and the soy boys they're kind
[787.20 - 790.24] of like stuck because they don't know
[788.64 - 792.84] the difference they don't know what's
[790.24 - 794.48] right or wrong the soy boys they don't
[792.84 - 796.24] know they don't know really what you
[794.48 - 797.88] have to do to keep yourself healthy
[796.24 - 800.52] they're just staying away from animal
[797.88 - 803.04] right they don't know okay and then the
[800.52 - 805.24] Meat Heads they like they put the nail
[803.04 - 807.88] in the coffin on that one they just
[805.24 - 810.40] hammered it in they they did it and they
[807.88 - 812.80] did a good job they slammed that one
[810.40 - 814.36] down everybody's throat and they were
[812.80 - 815.64] like this is what's going to happen to
[814.36 - 817.24] you you're a girl you want to be
[815.64 - 819.16] plant-based that's not going to work for
[817.24 - 821.72] you you're not going to be fertile
[819.16 - 824.40] you're going to have infertility and
[821.72 - 829.88] everybody went running and screaming for
[824.40 - 833.16] the most part they pretty much won the
[829.88 - 836.72] war just going to say right there pretty
[833.16 - 838.56] much won the war now let's go into it a
[836.72 - 840.44] little bit now some other stuff about it
[838.56 - 843.36] so
[840.44 - 845.76] uh are you guys with me so far we're
[843.36 - 848.88] making some killer food which is really
[845.76 - 851.24] amazing here crispy perspective Meat
[848.88 - 853.64] Heads versus soy boys laugh out loud
[851.24 - 856.16] that's what it is it's Meat Heads versus
[853.64 - 857.84] soy boys and the soy boys don't really
[856.16 - 859.44] know how to defend themselves and I'll
[857.84 - 861.24] tell you why so get this this is really
[859.44 - 863.80] an important part right
[861.24 - 865.56] here they don't know how to defend
[863.80 - 867.48] themselves because they don't know
[865.56 - 869.40] medical medium information they don't
[867.48 - 872.76] know why people are sick so when the
[869.40 - 875.08] Meat Heads who get sick who get sick the
[872.76 - 878.00] Meat Heads say to the soy
[875.08 - 880.76] boys okay you're not going to get your
[878.00 - 882.92] protein you're going to get sick you're
[880.76 - 884.40] going to have this problem that person
[882.92 - 886.80] problem your women aren't going to be
[884.40 - 889.12] able to have babies when they do that
[886.80 - 891.36] the soy boys they can't defend
[889.12 - 893.76] themselves because they don't know
[891.36 - 895.28] medical medium information they don't
[893.76 - 897.16] know about the mineral salts they don't
[895.28 - 899.32] know about the glucose they don't know
[897.16 - 901.00] about how you can be keto and do it all
[899.32 - 903.80] wrong you can be animal and do it all
[901.00 - 906.76] wrong they don't know that vegan isn't
[903.80 - 909.08] just vegan and period black and white
[906.76 - 911.72] they don't know that plant-based is just
[909.08 - 913.72] plant-based period in black and white
[911.72 - 916.08] they don't know that so anybody who's
[913.72 - 919.16] adopted different plant-based diets or
[916.08 - 921.24] or vegan diets they did it high fat and
[919.16 - 923.52] then the women that got on plant-based
[921.24 - 925.60] did it high fat and when they did at
[923.52 - 927.12] high fat they did not get rid of their
[925.60 - 928.64] symptoms maybe they did for the first
[927.12 - 931.12] few months and things were going along
[928.64 - 933.36] or the first year and then it all fell
[931.12 - 934.68] apart and that's a big deal all on its
[933.36 - 936.12] own so I'm just turning this down a
[934.68 - 940.80] little
[936.12 - 944.96] bit the plant-based movement did not did
[940.80 - 948.76] not learn the medical medium information
[944.96 - 952.20] to save itself and now it's going
[948.76 - 955.60] down it did not learn the information it
[952.20 - 959.08] needed to learn to go into war with the
[955.60 - 962.96] Meat Heads it did not learn this and for
[959.08 - 965.48] that reason it's going down it is I
[962.96 - 968.04] remember specifically four or five years
[965.48 - 969.72] ago I was doing an Instagram live one of
[968.04 - 972.04] those lives or something like that and
[969.72 - 974.08] somebody came on there just like you
[972.04 - 975.60] don't know it was it was it was some
[974.08 - 977.44] plant-based people I think it was two
[975.60 - 979.84] plant-based women or three there was
[977.44 - 981.80] like one plant-based woman and then her
[979.84 - 983.92] friend came on there too and they're
[981.80 - 986.00] like you don't know what's going on out
[983.92 - 988.40] there you don't understand this and that
[986.00 - 990.40] and this and and all that I can
[988.40 - 992.32] guarantee you right now they're not
[990.40 - 994.28] plant-based anymore I can guarantee you
[992.32 - 997.20] they've been switched over to animal
[994.28 - 998.88] protein like probably a year after that
[997.20 - 1001.64] they got a symptom their symptom didn't
[998.88 - 1003.88] go away the Meat Heads came up told them
[1001.64 - 1007.92] they weren't going to be fertile gone
[1003.88 - 1009.84] boom gone they got eaten up because the
[1007.92 - 1012.04] vegan movement and the plant-based
[1009.84 - 1014.92] movement did not understand medical
[1012.04 - 1020.28] medium information and did not learn it
[1014.92 - 1023.44] they drowned themselves in fats
[1020.28 - 1025.92] they got they got the natural flavorings
[1023.44 - 1028.44] in the way the MSG in the way and didn't
[1025.92 - 1030.56] know it kept them sick they got the
[1028.44 - 1032.20] citric acid in the way they kept the
[1030.56 - 1033.64] apple cider vinegar sure they were
[1032.20 - 1036.32] plant-based but they kept the apple
[1033.64 - 1039.48] cider vinegar and they kept the fake
[1036.32 - 1042.32] cheeses the fake cheeses and they got
[1039.48 - 1045.52] eaten up Alive by the animal kingdom
[1042.32 - 1048.12] people they've eaten them up alive buy
[1045.52 - 1052.00] shootout spit out the vegan movement's
[1048.12 - 1053.36] pretty much dead gone bottom line get
[1052.00 - 1056.72] this now here's another thing very
[1053.36 - 1058.00] interesting okay somebody can go vegan
[1056.72 - 1059.32] because they're worried about animal
[1058.00 - 1061.28] rights they're worried about animals
[1059.32 - 1063.56] they're worried about animals being hurt
[1061.28 - 1066.36] animals being killed we know that
[1063.56 - 1068.48] animals have souls yes but what people
[1066.36 - 1071.28] don't realize is the minute their
[1068.48 - 1074.04] symptoms came on that wasn't enough to
[1071.28 - 1076.56] keep them in the game there's very few
[1074.04 - 1079.48] women left in the vegan movement that
[1076.56 - 1082.24] were worried about animals and leather
[1079.48 - 1085.40] and worried about animal torture they
[1082.24 - 1087.84] got symptoms wor heard some heard a meat
[1085.40 - 1092.56] head talk about infertility and they're
[1087.84 - 1094.60] gone boom gone didn't matter at all
[1092.56 - 1096.56] about animals being hacked to death and
[1094.60 - 1098.84] killed it didn't matter about cows being
[1096.56 - 1101.44] knocked in the head pigs going into Pig
[1098.84 - 1102.68] machines and all coming out ground up it
[1101.44 - 1105.60] didn't matter
[1102.68 - 1107.88] anymore yeah they got into veganism
[1105.60 - 1109.40] became a vegan they did they didn't want
[1107.88 - 1113.00] they all got vegan
[1109.40 - 1115.40] shoes definitely and vegan sandals and
[1113.00 - 1118.76] vegan high heels and whatever shoes that
[1115.40 - 1122.56] they want vegan sneakers vegan whatever
[1118.76 - 1124.84] the vegan boots they got all those okay
[1122.56 - 1126.80] they they they were vegan for a while
[1124.84 - 1129.20] and then they got their first or second
[1126.80 - 1130.64] symptom again or they got symptoms for
[1129.20 - 1132.12] the first time in their life because
[1130.64 - 1134.04] they they went vegan because they were
[1132.12 - 1137.60] worried about animal cruelty and animals
[1134.04 - 1139.04] and all that stuff and then they got
[1137.60 - 1140.32] their first symptoms and then their
[1139.04 - 1142.48] doctors like you're not getting enough
[1140.32 - 1144.32] protein or they go on social and they
[1142.48 - 1146.96] see a doctor now on Social cuz what
[1144.32 - 1149.56] happened was social media did not have
[1146.96 - 1152.48] hardly any doctors on social media
[1149.56 - 1155.04] hardly any were on social media years
[1152.48 - 1157.28] ago they were just in practice they were
[1155.04 - 1160.12] practicing and then the birth of the
[1157.28 - 1162.20] social media doctor who doesn't practice
[1160.12 - 1164.76] so it's the birth now of the social
[1162.20 - 1166.92] media doctor who does not practice and
[1164.76 - 1169.40] does not know their patients pain and
[1166.92 - 1171.20] suffering who doesn't know really how to
[1169.40 - 1173.84] heal their patient who's dealing with
[1171.20 - 1176.32] pain and suffering they became a doctor
[1173.84 - 1178.32] didn't want to do it it was too nasty
[1176.32 - 1180.24] and dirty work they didn't want to
[1178.32 - 1182.20] communicate with people one-on-one in
[1180.24 - 1184.40] the office they couldn't stand people
[1182.20 - 1186.28] sitting there complaining to them about
[1184.40 - 1188.56] how they're sick and how this medication
[1186.28 - 1190.28] didn't help or how this herb didn't help
[1188.56 - 1192.56] that was in this mixture of stuff with
[1190.28 - 1194.00] probiotics and they left they didn't
[1192.56 - 1196.52] really get into it and they left so
[1194.00 - 1198.76] there's a birthing of doctors that never
[1196.52 - 1200.16] practiced they're not seasoned doctors
[1198.76 - 1201.92] They Don't Know Jack they don't know
[1200.16 - 1204.68] squat and they're out there on social
[1201.92 - 1206.56] media screaming away and screaming away
[1204.68 - 1208.12] and and and getting all kinds of bits
[1206.56 - 1210.00] and pieces of information that's not
[1208.12 - 1212.04] even from scientific studies and so
[1210.00 - 1213.72] forth right also poaching and stealing
[1212.04 - 1216.08] medical medium information along the way
[1213.72 - 1217.96] as well get rid of medals you do it this
[1216.08 - 1219.28] way get rid of medals do it this way
[1217.96 - 1220.80] they didn't even know about medals they
[1219.28 - 1222.80] went to regular medical school didn't
[1220.80 - 1224.72] want to practice anymore got interested
[1222.80 - 1227.88] in health now they're on social media
[1224.72 - 1231.00] it's a group of them too that took down
[1227.88 - 1234.44] the vegan movement that did a great
[1231.00 - 1237.52] job it's a group of those doctors that
[1234.44 - 1241.24] destroyed the vegan movement destroyed
[1237.52 - 1243.72] it destroyed it it's a ghost right now
[1241.24 - 1245.56] it's a ghost and I'm not on here
[1243.72 - 1248.12] screaming because I want everybody vegan
[1245.56 - 1250.88] and plant-based that's not it at all it
[1248.12 - 1252.20] doesn't matter to me if you want to heal
[1250.88 - 1254.92] plant-based you can do it through
[1252.20 - 1257.48] medical meme information you do the 369
[1254.92 - 1260.76] you do it you push through if you want
[1257.48 - 1263.04] to heal doing animal learn how to do it
[1260.76 - 1265.48] learn how to do it right with the animal
[1263.04 - 1268.12] stuff and you can do it and you can push
[1265.48 - 1270.76] through and you can heal I never took a
[1268.12 - 1272.60] side of the aisle do you guys know this
[1270.76 - 1276.36] you guys must know this
[1272.60 - 1279.48] right you guys must know this hey so
[1276.36 - 1282.08] when I turned plant-base there were many
[1279.48 - 1284.40] vegan people with symptoms on social
[1282.08 - 1287.04] social and vegan influencers did not
[1284.40 - 1289.12] have answers they would always say you
[1287.04 - 1293.20] are either detoxing or not do it right
[1289.12 - 1294.60] and that buried them it did it did it
[1293.20 - 1297.04] did they didn't want to know medical
[1294.60 - 1298.88] medium information the vegan movement
[1297.04 - 1301.00] the social the social media vegan
[1298.88 - 1303.32] movement they didn't understand medical
[1301.00 - 1305.28] medium information maybe they understood
[1303.32 - 1306.64] some tidbits they were even adverse to
[1305.28 - 1308.84] celery juice didn't even want to do
[1306.64 - 1311.08] celery juice or they did it privately
[1308.84 - 1314.56] secretly but that's all they did they
[1311.08 - 1317.04] did not want to learn how to heal while
[1314.56 - 1319.32] being plant-based so they all jumped
[1317.04 - 1321.60] ship and they started going to animal
[1319.32 - 1323.56] animal animal and it started out it
[1321.60 - 1325.64] started out with a lot of women
[1323.56 - 1327.24] influencers young women influencers that
[1325.64 - 1328.76] were vegan for a little while or
[1327.24 - 1330.76] plant-based for a little while and they
[1328.76 - 1332.24] started out with their social media
[1330.76 - 1334.32] platform with their so first social
[1332.24 - 1338.68] media post it just turns on and they're
[1334.32 - 1341.40] like so yeah I've been vegan I've been
[1338.68 - 1343.52] plant-based for like I don't know like a
[1341.40 - 1345.68] year and a half like what's my boyfriend
[1343.52 - 1349.28] doing Hey listen put the dog can you put
[1345.68 - 1352.12] the dog in the cat out and I and I have
[1349.28 - 1355.32] to tell you I got sick and I went to the
[1352.12 - 1358.32] doctor and the doctor said like he said
[1355.32 - 1361.12] like I had like a protein deficiency so
[1358.32 - 1362.64] listen girls I know that you like I know
[1361.12 - 1364.12] that I've been doing the vegan thing for
[1362.64 - 1366.12] like a year year and a half and you know
[1364.12 - 1367.72] me and I've been doing it so good I've
[1366.12 - 1370.96] been doing it to the
[1367.72 - 1372.76] letter I think that I'm changing now and
[1370.96 - 1374.92] I'm doing some raw milk and actually
[1372.76 - 1376.12] think my Skin's getting better and I'm
[1374.92 - 1378.88] starting to come around that was the
[1376.12 - 1380.68] first ones right there the very first
[1378.88 - 1383.84] ones right
[1380.68 - 1386.28] there okay and then it went from those
[1383.84 - 1389.44] very first ones it went from those very
[1386.28 - 1391.56] first ones to the second ones and then
[1389.44 - 1393.36] it went to the third ones what I mean by
[1391.56 - 1395.60] that is then then all of a sudden
[1393.36 - 1397.20] another Army of young women coming out
[1395.60 - 1399.48] of the plant-based vegan movement would
[1397.20 - 1401.36] be like I'm not getting enough protein
[1399.48 - 1403.40] I'm actually going to be my amino acid
[1401.36 - 1405.52] structures are wrong I went to this
[1403.40 - 1407.72] doctor I saw a guy on social media you
[1405.52 - 1411.12] should follow him too and it went to the
[1407.72 - 1413.88] next level went to the next level
[1411.12 - 1416.76] so and it's just next level and Next
[1413.88 - 1419.56] Level and where were the dudes where
[1416.76 - 1420.72] were the vegan dudes if you looked at
[1419.56 - 1423.88] the soy
[1420.72 - 1426.24] boys wherever they were whoever they are
[1423.88 - 1427.76] if you looked at the vegan dudes they
[1426.24 - 1429.48] didn't know how to stand up for
[1427.76 - 1431.88] themselves they didn't know how to how
[1429.48 - 1433.72] to fix things they didn't know how to
[1431.88 - 1436.48] get women to be like wait a minute no
[1433.72 - 1438.80] wait a minute something's wrong here it
[1436.48 - 1441.36] something's wrong here right they didn't
[1438.80 - 1444.64] know how to stand up for the plant-based
[1441.36 - 1447.92] movement and It Came Crashing Down
[1444.64 - 1450.84] crashing down and the trainers and the
[1447.92 - 1453.04] weightlifters and the buff dudes and
[1450.84 - 1456.20] that they got they even have credentials
[1453.04 - 1459.64] some of them are like nutritionist PS pH
[1456.20 - 1461.56] PhD MD chiropractor and they're coming
[1459.64 - 1463.32] up and they're just like in the gym and
[1461.56 - 1464.68] they're like you need your protein girls
[1463.32 - 1465.80] you need your protein you need this
[1464.68 - 1467.32] you're going to be in you're going to
[1465.80 - 1469.04] have infertility you're going to need
[1467.32 - 1471.36] your hormones balanced you need meat
[1469.04 - 1473.72] meat's got B6 be this be this like
[1471.36 - 1478.84] they're doing this and then women are
[1473.72 - 1481.68] just like totally mind totally mind like
[1478.84 - 1484.52] totally and so the vegan movement Came
[1481.68 - 1488.20] Crashing Down it's a ghost of what it
[1484.52 - 1491.12] was it's a fraction of what it was and
[1488.20 - 1494.32] it's going down fast I'm talking to a
[1491.12 - 1496.72] complete burn unless you're doing
[1494.32 - 1499.40] medical medium information and you learn
[1496.72 - 1501.64] how to heal and you understand how to do
[1499.40 - 1503.44] plant-base properly for your body and
[1501.64 - 1504.80] what you need as you're healing same
[1503.44 - 1507.40] thing if you're a me eat or two whatever
[1504.80 - 1509.08] in the whole bit Alissa says over there
[1507.40 - 1510.80] on YouTube it's so funny hearing you
[1509.08 - 1512.84] talk about this because I've seen this
[1510.80 - 1516.24] all happen I was following those
[1512.84 - 1518.60] influencers it's crazy there's a war on
[1516.24 - 1520.88] I hinted about the war six seven years
[1518.60 - 1523.08] ago in the books I hinted about the war
[1520.88 - 1525.00] five years ago I hinted about the war
[1523.08 - 1527.88] four years ago hinted about it and
[1525.00 - 1530.72] talked about it 3 years ago and then it
[1527.88 - 1534.92] took over over and that's it people are
[1530.72 - 1536.64] clobbered clobbered and there's Carnage
[1534.92 - 1540.76] Carnage from
[1536.64 - 1542.28] it and The Spoils of War and how how
[1540.76 - 1547.48] much pork
[1542.28 - 1551.32] fat money was made on the flip side how
[1547.48 - 1555.40] much money was made from the influencers
[1551.32 - 1557.44] pushing meat believe it or not I mean
[1555.40 - 1561.24] they slaughtered the plant-based
[1557.44 - 1563.28] movement basically now here's what's
[1561.24 - 1564.92] happened and I talked about the mistakes
[1563.28 - 1566.56] the carore movement made where I told
[1564.92 - 1570.08] you about that you want to watch the
[1566.56 - 1572.68] last live I did you to hear
[1570.08 - 1575.48] that but now we have basically the
[1572.68 - 1577.44] Atkins diet refled into a keto diet the
[1575.48 - 1580.12] keto diet is really some medical medium
[1577.44 - 1582.68] tools mixed in with meat that's what
[1580.12 - 1584.64] they did they were so smart that they
[1582.68 - 1587.24] learned how to poach medical medium
[1584.64 - 1590.36] information so the meat eaters and the
[1587.24 - 1592.56] Meat Heads in industry the influencers
[1590.36 - 1594.44] they learned how to poach key things for
[1592.56 - 1597.12] medical medium information stay away
[1594.44 - 1599.72] from MSG stay away from all kinds of
[1597.12 - 1602.24] stuff be cautious about corn stay away
[1599.72 - 1604.32] from all corn that was medical medium
[1602.24 - 1606.64] information meanwhile the vegans were
[1604.32 - 1609.32] eating all the corn all all the organic
[1606.64 - 1610.56] corn gobbling down organic corn organic
[1609.32 - 1613.28] corn organic
[1610.56 - 1616.52] corn the plant-based movement raw
[1613.28 - 1619.52] organic corn raw organic corn corn corn
[1616.52 - 1622.56] soy the vegan movement soy soy soy soy
[1619.52 - 1625.72] soy organic soy organic soy medical
[1622.56 - 1629.52] medium information it's all GMO it's all
[1625.72 - 1632.12] GMO that was medical medium
[1629.52 - 1635.60] information the vegan information right
[1632.12 - 1639.60] check this out the vegans we're doing
[1635.60 - 1641.84] soy corn organic corn feeling safe
[1639.60 - 1644.44] feeling comfortable nutritional yeast
[1641.84 - 1645.96] nutritional yeast nutritional yeast
[1644.44 - 1648.44] chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate
[1645.96 - 1651.04] chocolate chocolate and they got
[1648.44 - 1653.48] themselves sick they stayed sick and
[1651.04 - 1655.72] then the animal protein movement the new
[1653.48 - 1657.52] one I'm talking about the dudes were
[1655.72 - 1661.04] smart they were listening to Medical
[1657.52 - 1663.76] medium podcasts how do I know a podcast
[1661.04 - 1665.80] would come out and two to three of the
[1663.76 - 1667.32] meat head influencers would be saying
[1665.80 - 1669.08] the same thing that was in the podcast
[1667.32 - 1671.08] word for word like
[1669.08 - 1673.04] plagiarizing so they were listening to
[1671.08 - 1674.76] Medical medium information they were
[1673.04 - 1677.04] listening to the podcast they were
[1674.76 - 1679.44] looking through the books and they saw
[1677.04 - 1683.68] stay away from nutrition East and they
[1679.44 - 1687.36] saw stay away from corn it's all all GMO
[1683.68 - 1690.68] and they saw stay away from soy it's all
[1687.36 - 1693.24] GMO and they used it and poached it they
[1690.68 - 1696.24] added it to their fancy keto diet and
[1693.24 - 1697.92] they crushed the plant-based movement
[1696.24 - 1700.00] because the plant-based people they
[1697.92 - 1702.48] didn't want to know enough about medical
[1700.00 - 1704.60] medium information to keep them afloat
[1702.48 - 1708.72] to keep them safe to keep them able to
[1704.60 - 1712.92] do it it's Carnage it's Spoils of War
[1708.72 - 1716.20] it happened the war on veganism and how
[1712.92 - 1718.08] smart the Meat Heads were to be able to
[1716.20 - 1719.56] collaberate and even take medical medium
[1718.08 - 1722.12] information and do
[1719.56 - 1725.64] so they're so smart they started
[1722.12 - 1728.36] screaming no natural flavors no MSG no
[1725.64 - 1730.72] natural flavors no MSG they got it from
[1728.36 - 1732.80] medical medium information but they got
[1730.72 - 1735.52] it and they
[1732.80 - 1738.84] robed the plant-based movement do you
[1735.52 - 1740.84] guys understand what happened
[1738.84 - 1743.96] it's
[1740.84 - 1747.84] unbelievable I don't disrespect you know
[1743.96 - 1751.60] anybody and I have respect for everybody
[1747.84 - 1753.56] I even have respect for these idiots
[1751.60 - 1755.76] that did that to the plant-based
[1753.56 - 1760.44] movement because they were they were
[1755.76 - 1762.96] thinking at least evil evil but thinking
[1760.44 - 1765.68] they were thinking let's steal this from
[1762.96 - 1767.84] mm let's use it against a plant-based
[1765.68 - 1770.60] movement plant-based movement's not like
[1767.84 - 1773.00] let's take this from mm no they're just
[1770.60 - 1776.76] like oh guys's a
[1773.00 - 1780.64] medium what does it say in the Bible you
[1776.76 - 1783.36] know oh if you're a medium you're a
[1780.64 - 1786.92] sorcerer oh you're going to hell you
[1783.36 - 1789.60] know what I mean so what happened was a
[1786.92 - 1792.60] plant-based movement if you believe in
[1789.60 - 1794.20] karma if that's what you believe they
[1792.60 - 1799.24] got
[1794.20 - 1801.92] Karma they did slammed slammed
[1799.24 - 1806.00] the Meat Heads let's see an IG love the
[1801.92 - 1809.20] beach the Meat Heads versus the soy boys
[1806.00 - 1809.20] the new Westside
[1812.84 - 1821.12] Story okay IG you're absolutely right
[1818.72 - 1824.80] many people who are vegan convert it to
[1821.12 - 1829.96] meat and eggs again not just many almost
[1824.80 - 1833.20] all of them thanks uh thanks vegan
[1829.96 - 1834.12] snia very important to know so why does
[1833.20 - 1836.52] this
[1834.12 - 1838.92] matter I think it's
[1836.52 - 1840.64] important I think it's important because
[1838.92 - 1842.40] a couple of things that are critical
[1840.64 - 1844.84] when it comes down to chronic
[1842.40 - 1847.12] illness you have to know what caused it
[1844.84 - 1849.68] you have to know what caused it I'll see
[1847.12 - 1851.44] it 10 times in a row and you can say aw
[1849.68 - 1854.32] is repeating himself you have to know
[1851.44 - 1856.72] what caused it then you have to know
[1854.32 - 1858.44] what to do for it it's not about what
[1856.72 - 1860.00] side of the aisle you're on you want to
[1858.44 - 1861.88] be plant-based damn it you stay
[1860.00 - 1864.68] plant-based that's what you do you stay
[1861.88 - 1869.60] plant-based I support plant-based that's
[1864.68 - 1872.52] right I do I do big time and you
[1869.60 - 1876.00] actually can heal and get down to the
[1872.52 - 1878.36] nitty gritty inside and you can help
[1876.00 - 1879.96] detoxify you can help restore your
[1878.36 - 1881.44] immune system and do it plant-based but
[1879.96 - 1883.84] you got to do it right and you got to
[1881.44 - 1885.44] customize it right to yourself and you
[1883.84 - 1887.32] can't get thrown off and what happened
[1885.44 - 1889.60] was the vegan movement was just a whole
[1887.32 - 1892.08] bunch of people people all t one big
[1889.60 - 1893.68] tumble weed of people and they didn't
[1892.08 - 1895.60] know the medical medium
[1893.68 - 1897.88] information they were just eating
[1895.60 - 1900.56] whatever and eating vegan Donuts vegan
[1897.88 - 1903.16] cookies vegan this vegan soy vegan
[1900.56 - 1906.32] cheese vegan that vegan this vegan
[1903.16 - 1910.60] sausages and you know what's really
[1906.32 - 1912.96] sad is the fake processed Meats in the
[1910.60 - 1914.44] vegetarian movement so that was thrown
[1912.96 - 1917.28] on the vegans this was a really
[1914.44 - 1919.28] brilliant move right here so the Meat
[1917.28 - 1921.56] Heads the ones with now like they're
[1919.28 - 1923.64] flashing whatever nutritionist degree
[1921.56 - 1925.32] they have they're in the gym they're
[1923.64 - 1927.60] talking about how you need this amino
[1925.32 - 1930.16] acid they're talking about how you know
[1927.60 - 1931.60] soy kills right and they're talking
[1930.16 - 1934.12] about all these
[1931.60 - 1935.56] things and they and it's information
[1934.12 - 1937.88] they gleaned from medical medium really
[1935.56 - 1939.12] smart how they poached some good pieces
[1937.88 - 1941.48] really good pieces that they could have
[1939.12 - 1943.12] used that they could use that they did
[1941.48 - 1946.48] but the plant-based movement could have
[1943.12 - 1949.44] used those tools and they didn't they
[1946.48 - 1952.72] didn't what was wrong with
[1949.44 - 1956.12] them they didn't they didn't take the mm
[1952.72 - 1959.56] info and use the tools to battle the
[1956.12 - 1961.76] Meat Heads who have taken them
[1959.56 - 1964.92] down but let's go into the fake
[1961.76 - 1968.68] processed meat game
[1964.92 - 1970.76] whoa whoa what a great tool the
[1968.68 - 1972.52] influencers that are doing the keto and
[1970.76 - 1974.56] the meat and the carnivore whatever you
[1972.52 - 1977.08] want to you know chalk it all up into
[1974.56 - 1979.08] one big ball those meet either influen
[1977.08 - 1982.80] your trainer weightlifter dudes that are
[1979.08 - 1985.76] all into that those dudes they figured
[1982.80 - 1990.04] something else out they figured out that
[1985.76 - 1993.56] they can rank on the processed fake
[1990.04 - 1996.28] meats that vegans get blamed for what a
[1993.56 - 1999.00] win what a win because in those fake
[1996.28 - 2001.36] processed meats you got all kinds of MSG
[1999.00 - 2003.80] you got gluten you got everything bad in
[2001.36 - 2006.08] that stuff chemicals everything Galore
[2003.80 - 2008.72] and so these influencers are just like
[2006.08 - 2010.88] screaming you're the fake process meat
[2008.72 - 2012.88] people and you're doing soy and you're
[2010.88 - 2015.96] doing this and you're doing that it's an
[2012.88 - 2018.84] incredible weapon they use and here's
[2015.96 - 2021.56] the stupid part those guys don't even
[2018.84 - 2022.68] realize it those influencers that are
[2021.56 - 2024.28] using that weapon against the
[2022.68 - 2026.40] plant-based movement don't even realize
[2024.28 - 2028.04] something that wasn't the vegan movement
[2026.40 - 2031.24] that created all those fake processed
[2028.04 - 2033.72] meats that vegans tend to Love
[2031.24 - 2035.76] sometimes it wasn't that those fake
[2033.72 - 2039.00] processed Meats with all that [ __ ] in
[2035.76 - 2040.68] them was designed for the vegetar Arians
[2039.00 - 2042.24] which are now Dead and
[2040.68 - 2044.20] Gone
[2042.24 - 2046.92] Gone
[2044.20 - 2048.32] vegetarians gone there might be a few
[2046.92 - 2049.88] lingering around and there might be a
[2048.32 - 2051.28] few in the medical M community that say
[2049.88 - 2054.60] they're vegetarians and see themselves
[2051.28 - 2057.08] as that but they're mostly all gone the
[2054.60 - 2060.72] fake processed Meats were created for
[2057.08 - 2064.96] the vegetarians in the 60s the 70s the
[2060.72 - 2068.88] 80s the90s or the 70s ' 80s the '90s the
[2064.96 - 2072.20] early 2000s it was designed for the
[2068.88 - 2075.28] vegetarian the bean and riser that ate
[2072.20 - 2077.92] eggs and dairy products as well the
[2075.28 - 2081.12] vegetarian the vegetarian that drank
[2077.92 - 2087.04] goat's milk cow's milk raw milk cooked
[2081.12 - 2088.52] milk cheese kefir feta cheese ricotta
[2087.04 - 2090.68] cheese
[2088.52 - 2093.24] whatever the
[2090.68 - 2095.56] vegetarian the vegetarian that buried
[2093.24 - 2098.20] everything in nutritional yeast ate a
[2095.56 - 2100.20] pile of beans with cheese on it d cow
[2098.20 - 2103.00] cheese on it the
[2100.20 - 2106.08] vegetarian the vegetarian that ate lots
[2103.00 - 2107.48] of eggs in the morning and then wanted
[2106.08 - 2111.08] some fake
[2107.48 - 2113.92] sausage so the industry the food
[2111.08 - 2116.88] industry created for vegetarians and the
[2113.92 - 2119.28] vegetarian movement fake processed Meats
[2116.88 - 2122.40] they weren't even for the vegans and the
[2119.28 - 2123.72] plant-based people sure I'm sure a vegan
[2122.40 - 2125.56] that wanted to become vegan or a person
[2123.72 - 2127.76] that became vegan went and bought one of
[2125.56 - 2130.32] those turkeys that was actually
[2127.76 - 2132.28] processed meat with MSG and gluten but
[2130.32 - 2134.16] the point is it was created for the
[2132.28 - 2137.24] vegetarians so the Meat Heads
[2134.16 - 2138.84] influencers trainers PhD guys whatever
[2137.24 - 2140.72] you want to call them that have crushed
[2138.84 - 2143.12] the vegan movement saying that all their
[2140.72 - 2146.00] women are going to be infertile and all
[2143.12 - 2148.16] it takes is one woman who's vegan or
[2146.00 - 2150.44] plant-based one woman who's vegan or
[2148.16 - 2151.96] plant-based who can't have a baby and
[2150.44 - 2153.80] they're going to be convinced it's
[2151.96 - 2155.24] because those Meat Heads are right and
[2153.80 - 2157.36] those influencers are right it's going
[2155.24 - 2159.16] to they're going to be convinced that
[2157.36 - 2160.88] they totally went down the wrong track
[2159.16 - 2163.20] being plant-based and they're not going
[2160.88 - 2165.60] to have a baby now and that these dudes
[2163.20 - 2167.32] know better out there that are on social
[2165.60 - 2168.88] screaming away on how all their women
[2167.32 - 2170.72] are going to go infertile and I'm going
[2168.88 - 2174.36] to tell you what a weapon that was that
[2170.72 - 2176.96] was brilliant brilliant for their side
[2174.36 - 2176.96] to win the
[2177.40 - 2181.24] war you just got on the live you got to
[2179.80 - 2182.88] rewatch it from the beginning every
[2181.24 - 2187.32] single word is
[2182.88 - 2187.32] important once it's posted
[2188.44 - 2191.88] processed fake Meats with all the gluten
[2190.16 - 2193.24] and all the MSG and all the garbage in
[2191.88 - 2194.84] it and everything else you guys the
[2193.24 - 2196.44] processed fake Meats were for the
[2194.84 - 2198.32] vegetarians not for the vegans the
[2196.44 - 2200.12] vegans were never supposed to eat it
[2198.32 - 2202.72] they was never created for them it was
[2200.12 - 2204.76] created for the vegetarian and what
[2202.72 - 2206.44] happened was these influencers these
[2204.76 - 2208.64] Meatheads these keto these carnivore
[2206.44 - 2210.72] influencers and and and everything above
[2208.64 - 2212.48] including their doctor friends and PhD
[2210.72 - 2215.40] friends and everything else what they
[2212.48 - 2217.76] did was they pulled a real good fast one
[2215.40 - 2219.36] on those vegans and what they did was
[2217.76 - 2221.60] they convinced everybody that the
[2219.36 - 2223.36] processed fake Meats were vegan were for
[2221.60 - 2225.04] vegans they were made for vegans they
[2223.36 - 2227.12] were created for vegans and the vegans
[2225.04 - 2230.12] just slobbered it and ate it all down
[2227.12 - 2231.60] and that was it really good move but
[2230.12 - 2233.56] guess what the plant-based people in the
[2231.60 - 2234.96] vegans can't stick up for themselves cuz
[2233.56 - 2238.40] a they're probably not watching medical
[2234.96 - 2242.20] medium stuff really B they don't want to
[2238.40 - 2243.84] learn C there was a way to battle that
[2242.20 - 2245.48] one easily cuz that was for the
[2243.84 - 2248.48] vegetarians not for the plant-based
[2245.48 - 2248.48] people
[2248.68 - 2251.64] so let's get down to the
[2252.40 - 2256.64] nitty-gritty a so over there on YouTube
[2254.56 - 2259.16] when I turned plant base there were many
[2256.64 - 2261.68] vegan people with symptoms on social and
[2259.16 - 2263.92] vegan influencers did not have answers
[2261.68 - 2266.56] they would always say you are either
[2263.92 - 2268.48] detoxing or not doing it right correct
[2266.56 - 2271.04] that's what they would always say you're
[2268.48 - 2272.32] detoxing too much you're detoxing too
[2271.04 - 2274.28] much that's what they would always say
[2272.32 - 2276.72] but they didn't know information they
[2274.28 - 2279.08] didn't know that it's not detoxing too
[2276.72 - 2281.48] much they didn't know it was you got
[2279.08 - 2283.84] viruses you got pathogens you're not
[2281.48 - 2285.80] eating the right way to support going
[2283.84 - 2287.16] against those pathogens they didn't know
[2285.80 - 2289.12] why you were sick they didn't know
[2287.16 - 2291.64] autoimmune a farce they didn't know
[2289.12 - 2293.52] anything Brook over there on YouTube I'm
[2291.64 - 2295.44] a perfect example of this I was vegan
[2293.52 - 2299.16] for over 10 years before I had my health
[2295.44 - 2299.16] challenges after having my first
[2302.72 - 2308.12] baby over there Michael Charles over
[2306.20 - 2310.84] there on YouTube You're going to be
[2308.12 - 2312.96] deficient quotation marks there is what
[2310.84 - 2314.92] they'll say not knowing anything about
[2312.96 - 2317.16] the B12 that's in your book and the B12
[2314.92 - 2319.20] information okay great one so Mye
[2317.16 - 2320.64] Charles that's really a really important
[2319.20 - 2325.32] one and I want to talk about that for a
[2320.64 - 2327.60] second okay great one okay the B12
[2325.32 - 2330.48] weapon is a great one too that's what
[2327.60 - 2332.24] he's saying it's these influencers like
[2330.48 - 2333.76] I said before the Meat Heads the
[2332.24 - 2335.64] trainers whatever you want to call it
[2333.76 - 2337.12] the bodybuilders or just the doctors
[2335.64 - 2338.76] that don't want to work on patients
[2337.12 - 2340.16] they're just they're wealthy doctors
[2338.76 - 2341.56] don't need to work ever a day in their
[2340.16 - 2344.24] life their mommy and daddy paid for
[2341.56 - 2346.00] their medical their medical uh school
[2344.24 - 2348.00] they they went through Medical School
[2346.00 - 2349.80] whatever it is all paid for by Mommy and
[2348.00 - 2352.28] Daddy they got which is fine whatever
[2349.80 - 2354.52] that's fine they got they got they got
[2352.28 - 2356.08] their medical license but realize they
[2354.52 - 2358.40] don't want to practice they don't want
[2356.08 - 2361.16] to touch dirty people they're too you
[2358.40 - 2362.88] know above that they don't want to deal
[2361.16 - 2364.44] with people complaining and crying in
[2362.88 - 2366.88] the waiting rooms and them just trying
[2364.44 - 2369.44] to like offer a drug or whatever it is
[2366.88 - 2372.56] so they just went on social there's a
[2369.44 - 2374.56] massive upsurge of these what I call
[2372.56 - 2375.56] fake doctors because they don't want to
[2374.56 - 2377.20] practice and they don't have
[2375.56 - 2379.12] experiencing practice experience
[2377.20 - 2380.72] practice right they don't have that so
[2379.12 - 2381.88] what they're rising up right now and
[2380.72 - 2383.24] they're the ones that are taking down
[2381.88 - 2385.12] the vegan movement and the plant-based
[2383.24 - 2388.88] movement they Ed the B12 example right
[2385.12 - 2391.24] there so Mike they Ed the B12 example
[2388.88 - 2393.36] and but what the vegans and the
[2391.24 - 2395.80] plant-based people did not adopt what
[2393.36 - 2397.44] they did not do is no medical medium
[2395.80 - 2399.96] information enough to know that
[2397.44 - 2402.36] everybody's B12 deficient all the meat
[2399.96 - 2406.44] eaters are B12 deficient and the
[2402.36 - 2408.04] B12 in meat is not even synergistic to
[2406.44 - 2410.56] your body it's not even
[2408.04 - 2414.40] bioidentical so you can't even use that
[2410.56 - 2417.48] B12 the B12 in meat isn't B12 your body
[2414.40 - 2419.36] uses so you become B12 deficient even if
[2417.48 - 2422.72] your blood test says you have
[2419.36 - 2424.60] B12 and so that's why millions of meat
[2422.72 - 2426.40] eaters are getting sick every single day
[2424.60 - 2428.16] millions of Keto people millions of the
[2426.40 - 2429.92] Paleo people in the past millions of the
[2428.16 - 2431.48] Atkins people millions of the new
[2429.92 - 2434.36] carnivore people well there isn't
[2431.48 - 2438.20] millions of those millions of the keto
[2434.36 - 2440.96] people they're all getting sick too and
[2438.20 - 2442.52] they're all getting like lots of
[2440.96 - 2446.96] different symptoms and they're getting
[2442.52 - 2449.24] B12 deficient you can be B12 deficient
[2446.96 - 2452.24] both as a plant-based person and a vegan
[2449.24 - 2454.16] person and as a keto person carnivore
[2452.24 - 2456.64] person or any kind of animal protein
[2454.16 - 2458.72] person you can be B12 deficient and
[2456.64 - 2460.32] guess what every everybody really is
[2458.72 - 2461.56] even if their blood test says a certain
[2460.32 - 2463.32] thing if you learn medical medum
[2461.56 - 2465.28] information you can learn how to heal
[2463.32 - 2467.36] the details matter but guess what the
[2465.28 - 2470.36] pl-based movement many of them didn't
[2467.36 - 2473.28] really want to learn or know or didn't
[2470.36 - 2475.32] really look at it and they got burned
[2473.28 - 2477.48] they got convinced and pushed out of
[2475.32 - 2480.28] something that intuitively they knew was
[2477.48 - 2482.24] good for them keep that in mind a lot of
[2480.28 - 2484.16] people that went plant-based intuitively
[2482.24 - 2486.24] thought this was good for me they used
[2484.16 - 2488.12] their intuition and they knew that the
[2486.24 - 2490.80] plant-based movement was good for them
[2488.12 - 2493.00] but then they got psyched out by demons
[2490.80 - 2494.92] demons in the hellfield that actually
[2493.00 - 2497.04] took them out and that's what this is
[2494.92 - 2499.76] about it's the war the Meat Heads
[2497.04 - 2499.76] against the soy
[2501.40 - 2507.96] boys and as soy boy lost because I don't
[2505.88 - 2510.04] know about a recovery from this I really
[2507.96 - 2511.72] don't a recovery for the vegan movement
[2510.04 - 2512.80] is going to be really hard and I know
[2511.72 - 2514.72] what you're thinking you're thinking at
[2512.80 - 2516.40] the last vegan Festival there was 20,000
[2514.72 - 2517.76] people there 15,000 people there that's
[2516.40 - 2521.52] a joke
[2517.76 - 2523.64] that's a joke for the vegan movement for
[2521.52 - 2526.52] the plant-based movement that's really
[2523.64 - 2530.24] sad really
[2526.52 - 2532.60] sad really is and half those people were
[2530.24 - 2534.24] still half to three4 of those people are
[2532.60 - 2536.08] still doing animal products here and
[2534.24 - 2537.76] there and that leads me to the next part
[2536.08 - 2539.80] of the
[2537.76 - 2542.32] topic there's not a lot of people that
[2539.80 - 2543.88] were truly plant-based they always they
[2542.32 - 2546.00] were plant-based for a month and then
[2543.88 - 2547.96] not anymore for a day plant-based for
[2546.00 - 2549.32] another month and not anymore for a day
[2547.96 - 2550.92] then they ate a piece of cheese at a
[2549.32 - 2553.32] friend's house then they ate a piece of
[2550.92 - 2556.44] cheese here then they ate an egg two
[2553.32 - 2558.44] weeks later there really wasn't a lot of
[2556.44 - 2560.20] people that were plant-based plant-based
[2558.44 - 2562.56] plant-based they wanted to be they were
[2560.20 - 2564.72] trying but they just couldn't do it and
[2562.56 - 2566.76] they just they caved in and they ate an
[2564.72 - 2567.92] egg and they ate a piece of cheese and
[2566.76 - 2570.28] that's what they
[2567.92 - 2572.08] did but there's a lot of people that
[2570.28 - 2573.80] thought when they were vegans and they
[2572.08 - 2575.36] were being a vegan and they thought
[2573.80 - 2576.52] animal cruelty and animals dying and
[2575.36 - 2579.00] getting slaughtered and pigs getting
[2576.52 - 2580.60] slaughtered and killed they were like
[2579.00 - 2582.56] that was enough for them to not do
[2580.60 - 2584.72] anything animal so they're really strict
[2582.56 - 2587.08] like no animal animal no animal and then
[2584.72 - 2588.52] when they got 24 years old 25 years old
[2587.08 - 2589.68] and they got their first symptoms and
[2588.52 - 2591.76] something went wrong and they found
[2589.68 - 2594.00] something on their skin and everything
[2591.76 - 2595.68] they panicked and it wasn't about the
[2594.00 - 2597.60] animals anymore forget the animals who
[2595.68 - 2601.24] cares if they die I got a problem on my
[2597.60 - 2602.20] skin I'm protein deficient now and or
[2601.24 - 2605.28] they
[2602.20 - 2610.04] believe so the plant-based movement was
[2605.28 - 2613.84] always high fat High high fat high fat
[2610.04 - 2616.28] even when it was lowfat a little bit it
[2613.84 - 2617.88] wasn't low it wasn't low of fat enough
[2616.28 - 2620.36] for somebody that had a serious health
[2617.88 - 2621.96] condition that needed to heal so
[2620.36 - 2623.52] therefore there's really nowhere to go
[2621.96 - 2624.92] you go into the vegan plant-based
[2623.52 - 2626.76] movement you're kind of stuck you're in
[2624.92 - 2628.16] high-fat land you're in all this other
[2626.76 - 2630.00] stuff you're using canola oil you're
[2628.16 - 2631.48] eating canola oil without even realizing
[2630.00 - 2635.16] it all these
[2631.48 - 2638.32] things nutritional yeast vinegars canola
[2635.16 - 2639.80] oils mixed all this stuff citric acid
[2638.32 - 2641.32] all these things right you're eating
[2639.80 - 2643.52] corn you're eating corn but you think
[2641.32 - 2645.76] it's organic but it's but it's not and
[2643.52 - 2647.76] it's not organic and it's GMO and you're
[2645.76 - 2651.48] eating soy and you think it's organic
[2647.76 - 2655.16] and then like I said
[2651.48 - 2658.72] earlier the winners of the war the
[2655.16 - 2660.92] winners of the war they won they learned
[2658.72 - 2663.16] medical medium information they learn
[2660.92 - 2665.76] that all soy was bad they learned that
[2663.16 - 2667.92] all corn was bad they learned that and
[2665.76 - 2669.80] by the way corn and soy Fe pathogens so
[2667.92 - 2672.04] here you are a plant-based person eating
[2669.80 - 2673.84] lots of organic corn all the time not
[2672.04 - 2676.68] just one or two ears of corn in the
[2673.84 - 2678.28] summertime you're eating it every day
[2676.68 - 2679.48] and this is key medical beam information
[2678.28 - 2681.36] you're eating it every day you're
[2679.48 - 2683.20] feeding pathogens so here you are as a
[2681.36 - 2684.88] plant-based person and you're feeding
[2683.20 - 2686.32] pathogens and you're getting sick and
[2684.88 - 2688.00] symptoms because of all the corn you're
[2686.32 - 2689.52] eating but you're plant-based you're
[2688.00 - 2690.80] confused so now you're running back to
[2689.52 - 2694.08] eggs you're running back to things you
[2690.80 - 2696.64] see an influencer you see all the women
[2694.08 - 2698.76] influencers the young women influencers
[2696.64 - 2700.12] that try tried the plant-based movement
[2698.76 - 2701.80] and now they're on their feeds talking
[2700.12 - 2703.44] about their protein deficiencies and how
[2701.80 - 2704.60] they don't have they're not fertile or
[2703.44 - 2706.40] they don't know if they're fertile
[2704.60 - 2707.84] enough you hear that and then you're
[2706.40 - 2709.76] another woman too and you're just like
[2707.84 - 2711.84] oh my God I'm hearing that I'm running
[2709.76 - 2713.28] from this I'm getting a symptom I didn't
[2711.84 - 2715.52] know it was because I'm eating corn
[2713.28 - 2716.84] every other day I'm getting a symptom I
[2715.52 - 2718.20] better get out of this like they're
[2716.84 - 2719.72] getting out of this and I better get on
[2718.20 - 2721.52] some eggs and some dairy products and
[2719.72 - 2723.60] whatever else I better start eating meat
[2721.52 - 2728.20] and choking that stuff down no matter
[2723.60 - 2728.20] what I better learn how to choke it down
[2732.40 - 2736.56] yeah important to know and I talked
[2734.72 - 2739.04] about the last live anybody that's on a
[2736.56 - 2741.80] carnivore diet keep in mind you're going
[2739.04 - 2743.12] to hit the wall at some point you're
[2741.80 - 2744.68] just going to hit the wall at some point
[2743.12 - 2747.16] you're going to get gluc glucose
[2744.68 - 2749.16] deficient in your
[2747.16 - 2751.80] brain you're going to get bogged down
[2749.16 - 2753.84] with all that fat that animal fat you're
[2751.80 - 2755.16] going to get nutrient deficient for real
[2753.84 - 2757.24] it's going to show up a couple years
[2755.16 - 2759.16] down the road and you're going to have
[2757.24 - 2760.68] to do what the carnivore people do which
[2759.16 - 2762.64] is bringing honey and lemon that's
[2760.68 - 2764.64] medical medium information bringing
[2762.64 - 2766.16] honey and lemon and then you're going to
[2764.64 - 2767.72] have to bringing fruit medical medium
[2766.16 - 2769.04] information again remember I was the one
[2767.72 - 2771.56] that broke fruit fear do you guys
[2769.04 - 2774.00] remember that medical medium information
[2771.56 - 2775.56] broke the whole fruit fear thing broke
[2774.00 - 2777.40] the whole fruit fear thing so that
[2775.56 - 2780.44] carnivore could have S could save its
[2777.40 - 2782.72] skin did you know that I made Fruit
[2780.44 - 2785.44] acceptable in the health World which
[2782.72 - 2787.32] means the carnivore people now saved
[2785.44 - 2789.16] their butts when they were dying from
[2787.32 - 2791.28] just eating meat alone they saved their
[2789.16 - 2793.32] butts by now bringing in Fruit that's
[2791.28 - 2796.16] medical medium information that allowed
[2793.32 - 2797.88] the carnivore people to eat fruit they
[2796.16 - 2799.44] would have never touched fruit in a
[2797.88 - 2801.96] million
[2799.44 - 2804.72] years in a million
[2801.96 - 2807.08] years if it wasn't for medical medium
[2804.72 - 2809.12] spending all those years all that time
[2807.08 - 2812.04] publishing all that stuff about fruit
[2809.12 - 2814.20] fear and making it acceptable so people
[2812.04 - 2816.24] would bring in their fruits and not be
[2814.20 - 2819.20] afraid and ostracized right and bring in
[2816.24 - 2821.80] their fruits so when the new keto
[2819.20 - 2825.36] influencer SL you know
[2821.80 - 2828.16] phdd bodybuilder SLT triner SL meat had
[2825.36 - 2830.60] came up on social media they were like
[2828.16 - 2832.92] I'm eating fruit now with my meat I'm
[2830.60 - 2834.52] eating fruit now with this you know with
[2832.92 - 2837.08] this with my chicken whatever I'm
[2834.52 - 2838.64] meaning fruit and they're doing it
[2837.08 - 2840.76] because I made it safe for them they
[2838.64 - 2843.88] were smart they took that information
[2840.76 - 2846.00] and they used it and it's protecting
[2843.88 - 2849.24] them while they're slaughtering the
[2846.00 - 2849.24] plant-based in vegan
[2849.80 - 2854.64] movement another thing they did was they
[2852.16 - 2857.24] weaponized not only the infertility they
[2854.64 - 2860.20] weaponized the hormones being imbalanced
[2857.24 - 2862.20] in women with their reproductive system
[2860.20 - 2865.68] they weaponized
[2862.20 - 2867.52] that they weaponized the soy and the
[2865.68 - 2868.76] corn information from medical medium
[2867.52 - 2870.96] they took that information they
[2868.76 - 2873.16] weaponized
[2870.96 - 2874.40] that and they
[2873.16 - 2877.68] [Music]
[2874.40 - 2879.12] weaponized the feminization
[2877.68 - 2882.52] Factor
[2879.12 - 2885.24] feminizing they weaponize that they
[2882.52 - 2887.44] convince the plant-based women and the
[2885.24 - 2890.72] vegan women that the dudes that are
[2887.44 - 2892.80] vegan are feminized they're feminine now
[2890.72 - 2894.72] from what they were doing and that's not
[2892.80 - 2897.20] going to help them you know with
[2894.72 - 2899.60] fertility too their sperm is not going
[2897.20 - 2901.76] to be strong so the influencer the
[2899.60 - 2903.52] meater influencer now the new one that
[2901.76 - 2905.84] I'm talking about out there the new ones
[2903.52 - 2907.56] they're like my sperm is strong that's
[2905.84 - 2909.64] what they're all basically trying to say
[2907.56 - 2912.32] and they actually do say that
[2909.64 - 2914.48] too some not all of them but some of
[2912.32 - 2917.32] them say that and how to get strong
[2914.48 - 2920.32] sperm and ladies that's what's going on
[2917.32 - 2922.64] here your soy boys they're weak they're
[2920.32 - 2925.24] infertile their sperm isn't working
[2922.64 - 2927.84] right they're eating soy they're flimsy
[2925.24 - 2929.92] guys they're soft guys they're weak guys
[2927.84 - 2932.04] they've completely coined the
[2929.92 - 2935.08] plant-based movement and the vegan
[2932.04 - 2940.24] movement with that kind of
[2935.08 - 2942.60] thing as a brilliant game and
[2940.24 - 2944.08] strategy and from what I see I don't
[2942.60 - 2947.32] think the plant-based movement and the
[2944.08 - 2949.80] vegan movements coming out of it Toby
[2947.32 - 2952.40] 777 on YouTube the details are so so
[2949.80 - 2954.12] important they are you can be a
[2952.40 - 2957.32] plant-based
[2954.12 - 2961.36] person and you can heal you can heal
[2957.32 - 2964.60] from dastardly stuff bad chronic illness
[2961.36 - 2968.24] you can heal multiple sclerosis you can
[2964.60 - 2970.64] heal okay someone over there
[2968.24 - 2972.60] see over there on YouTube there are a
[2970.64 - 2975.04] lot of people who have been eating only
[2972.60 - 2977.28] meat for many years have a lot of energy
[2975.04 - 2980.04] and don't drink coffee they are you like
[2977.28 - 2981.16] being lied to you like being lied to see
[2980.04 - 2982.68] you're actually one of those that
[2981.16 - 2984.68] believes every single thing someone says
[2982.68 - 2986.24] on social media about what they're doing
[2984.68 - 2987.64] so you don't think anybody lies nobody
[2986.24 - 2989.84] lies nobody's a
[2987.64 - 2993.64] liar they're
[2989.84 - 2995.88] lying because I'll tell you right now if
[2993.64 - 2997.20] you're a woman and you only eat meat and
[2995.88 - 2999.32] you don't bring in any anything else
[2997.20 - 3001.84] just eat meat Watch What Happens in 6
[2999.32 - 3005.96] months watch your skin fall apart watch
[3001.84 - 3009.56] your collagen basically dissolve in your
[3005.96 - 3013.40] body watch your face change watch
[3009.56 - 3013.40] everything get really
[3013.64 - 3017.16] bad it's really
[3017.68 - 3021.88] sad they have to bring a caffeine in
[3020.00 - 3023.32] order to function and they do bring in
[3021.88 - 3025.12] caffeine in order to function but in
[3023.32 - 3027.96] order to keep a good social media
[3025.12 - 3029.92] profile going and a good social media
[3027.96 - 3031.68] campaign going they're not going to tell
[3029.92 - 3033.12] you what they dip into once in a while
[3031.68 - 3035.60] and what they eat once in a while and
[3033.12 - 3037.28] what they grab and the Apple they ate
[3035.60 - 3038.68] last week or three days ago they're not
[3037.28 - 3041.84] going to tell you what they're doing to
[3038.68 - 3044.00] scam that you know scam you and get by
[3041.84 - 3045.88] and what binge they're on when they when
[3044.00 - 3047.44] they binge and when they do it and the
[3045.88 - 3048.60] time they did it they're not going to do
[3047.44 - 3050.04] that because that's going to destroy
[3048.60 - 3051.16] their platform now their platform is
[3050.04 - 3052.36] destroyed it's not going to be helpful
[3051.16 - 3056.32] for them they're not going to be able to
[3052.36 - 3056.32] bank and Bank
[3056.88 - 3061.08] The Spoils of War man slaughtering the
[3059.16 - 3063.56] vegan and plant-based movement they did
[3061.08 - 3065.48] a great job and they did it they did it
[3063.56 - 3067.64] is there any hope there's always
[3065.48 - 3069.28] hope I don't see the vegan and
[3067.64 - 3071.32] plant-based movement coming out of it
[3069.28 - 3074.92] anytime soon I see it going down even to
[3071.32 - 3077.40] a darker pit in a deeper rabbit hole is
[3074.92 - 3079.64] where it's going if you're plant-based
[3077.40 - 3080.96] stay plant-based but learn how to do it
[3079.64 - 3084.04] right if you're plant-based stay
[3080.96 - 3087.16] plant-based learn how to do it right
[3084.04 - 3090.08] okay it's very important right there
[3087.16 - 3092.36] learn how to do it right save yourself
[3090.08 - 3094.64] cuz you will be on meet at some point in
[3092.36 - 3097.00] your life because you'll be so confused
[3094.64 - 3098.88] you won't even know 10 ways a Sunday you
[3097.00 - 3100.60] won't even have any clue and you'll be
[3098.88 - 3102.92] back on eggs and whatever else and meat
[3100.60 - 3104.68] and whatever else confused doing the
[3102.92 - 3106.88] ring around the rosie doing the musical
[3104.68 - 3109.36] chairs
[3106.88 - 3111.80] doing you know you're going to be in
[3109.36 - 3113.64] that big old forever Catch 22 not
[3111.80 - 3115.88] knowing what to do not knowing how to
[3113.64 - 3117.80] heal symptoms still coming symptoms
[3115.88 - 3120.00] still kind of going up and down new
[3117.80 - 3121.84] symptoms appearing that's what where
[3120.00 - 3123.44] you'll be if you're plant-based stay
[3121.84 - 3127.00] plant-based but learn how to do it and
[3123.44 - 3130.40] customize it to what you need
[3127.00 - 3133.16] critical maram right there it is so true
[3130.40 - 3135.44] I read books by MDS to help my brain and
[3133.16 - 3137.56] it was all about keto it made me worse
[3135.44 - 3139.48] of course cuz keto can't help a brain
[3137.56 - 3141.16] thank goodness I found medical medium
[3139.48 - 3144.00] through a friend and and that takes me
[3141.16 - 3145.84] to the next part you can't fix a brain
[3144.00 - 3147.52] you can't detox a brain when you're on
[3145.84 - 3150.28] keto
[3147.52 - 3151.84] it just can't but if you're 24 years old
[3150.28 - 3153.60] and you're working out every day and you
[3151.84 - 3156.60] really you didn't have a sick moment in
[3153.60 - 3158.80] your life yet you just got some athletes
[3156.60 - 3160.16] foot and you just got some fungus on
[3158.80 - 3161.28] your feet because all those dudes got
[3160.16 - 3162.80] fungus on their feet and I'm going to
[3161.28 - 3165.72] tell you right now because I know this
[3162.80 - 3168.80] because I know I've talked to enough
[3165.72 - 3172.32] people enough times I also got a little
[3168.80 - 3174.84] voice in my ear and so they still got
[3172.32 - 3177.84] athletes foot they still got jockage
[3174.84 - 3179.48] fungus that comes in goes with creams
[3177.84 - 3181.56] they still got all that but they're not
[3179.48 - 3183.84] exhibiting that neurological fatigue yet
[3181.56 - 3186.24] or anything like that that comes later
[3183.84 - 3187.52] that comes later when they hit the wall
[3186.24 - 3189.76] and they get their first batch of
[3187.52 - 3191.76] shingles all over the side of their body
[3189.76 - 3193.36] on the side of their torso and they're
[3191.76 - 3195.28] in they're into that whole thing now
[3193.36 - 3197.04] they're just you know in that place and
[3195.28 - 3199.76] they're confused and like what's going
[3197.04 - 3202.36] on here it comes sickness comes every or
[3199.76 - 3202.36] they just have a heart
[3202.48 - 3206.84] attack like so many people are doing
[3204.56 - 3208.72] every single day right now at age 20 2
[3206.84 - 3211.12] age 30 the heart attacks are crazy right
[3208.72 - 3213.20] now the amount of people that are dying
[3211.12 - 3216.52] with heart problems is unbelievable just
[3213.20 - 3220.76] like I predicted Tressa says can we also
[3216.52 - 3224.12] talk about all those Meat Heads in shape
[3220.76 - 3225.84] claiming they look buff from carnivore
[3224.12 - 3227.60] when they're doing steroids and of
[3225.84 - 3229.00] course not mentioning it of course they
[3227.60 - 3230.36] do a lot of steroids and a lot of guys
[3229.00 - 3232.76] do they don't do steroids like the
[3230.36 - 3235.08] steroid days like the old days they
[3232.76 - 3237.24] don't do that like the old days they do
[3235.08 - 3238.84] testosterone
[3237.24 - 3241.12] they don't do the they don't do the
[3238.84 - 3242.48] steroids that they did back back then
[3241.12 - 3244.40] just so you know and the growth hormones
[3242.48 - 3245.88] and the in the steroids they just do
[3244.40 - 3247.68] testosterone right the doctors are
[3245.88 - 3249.24] giving them all testosterone they want
[3247.68 - 3250.52] their testosterone to be somewhere
[3249.24 - 3255.68] around
[3250.52 - 3257.52] 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 so they want
[3255.68 - 3261.08] that they want to see testosterone
[3257.52 - 3262.68] levels like 1,800 on their blood test
[3261.08 - 3265.40] and they and then they want to even take
[3262.68 - 3268.04] more testosterone than that so they are
[3265.40 - 3269.60] on steroids they up their testosterone
[3268.04 - 3272.20] they're working out that's what they're
[3269.60 - 3274.60] doing that's a big part of it too out
[3272.20 - 3277.40] there you know the other big part of it
[3274.60 - 3279.44] is that the ones you see on social they
[3277.40 - 3282.20] don't have a job most of them they don't
[3279.44 - 3284.28] work a job they're in the gym they're in
[3282.20 - 3286.04] the gym four hours a day they pamper
[3284.28 - 3289.24] themselves they self-care themselves to
[3286.04 - 3291.52] death they can do it day in and day out
[3289.24 - 3294.44] haven't gotten sick yet their stress is
[3291.52 - 3296.72] really low to down real low those are
[3294.44 - 3298.84] the ones you see on social those are the
[3296.72 - 3300.52] said to Mommy and Daddy are you guys all
[3298.84 - 3303.36] right I want to have a family meeting
[3300.52 - 3305.88] here is Dad around I want to have a
[3303.36 - 3307.76] family meeting is Dad around and what
[3305.88 - 3310.00] they do is then they go and they have a
[3307.76 - 3312.48] family meeting and it's like hey I just
[3310.00 - 3315.56] want to tell you guys Mom Dad I know you
[3312.48 - 3317.88] gave me $250,000 to do you know medical
[3315.56 - 3320.40] school and I know that I I passed
[3317.88 - 3323.44] medical school but I just it it's not
[3320.40 - 3325.36] it's not speaking to me right now son
[3323.44 - 3326.92] you are supposed to be a doctor it's not
[3325.36 - 3329.80] speaking to me right now but I was
[3326.92 - 3331.56] hoping that you're okay if um if I just
[3329.80 - 3333.04] play on social media for a while and try
[3331.56 - 3334.84] to find myself I hear a lot of people
[3333.04 - 3336.76] are making money and I want to help
[3334.84 - 3339.52] people through that oh that's a really
[3336.76 - 3342.00] good idea that's a great that's a great
[3339.52 - 3344.44] idea you should do that honey oh I guess
[3342.00 - 3345.80] so why not you're you're our son and
[3344.44 - 3348.76] that's what's happening right now is
[3345.80 - 3350.72] these all these doctors are literally
[3348.76 - 3353.08] they're all just playing the field now
[3350.72 - 3354.68] on social and they're not practicing and
[3353.08 - 3356.36] they're able to selfcare themselves to
[3354.68 - 3357.60] death and do four hours in the gym every
[3356.36 - 3359.28] day and if that's what they want to do
[3357.60 - 3361.68] fine they're on testosterone they're
[3359.28 - 3364.00] doing stuff like that and some do
[3361.68 - 3366.72] regular steroids definitely some still
[3364.00 - 3368.48] do regular steroids
[3366.72 - 3372.08] so
[3368.48 - 3375.76] um you're getting a well-rounded episode
[3372.08 - 3378.76] dror Fawn a real doctor if not on
[3375.76 - 3381.40] testosterone testosterone
[3378.76 - 3384.28] precursors like
[3381.40 - 3388.76] HCG oh my God
[3384.28 - 3388.76] exactly I agree I
[3390.24 - 3397.24] agree all right so quick little rundown
[3393.68 - 3398.84] a couple little couple more things about
[3397.24 - 3403.04] it
[3398.84 - 3406.04] so there's so many fighting words and
[3403.04 - 3409.64] strategies and techniques that the Meat
[3406.04 - 3412.52] Heads have now you just can't beat it if
[3409.64 - 3414.92] you're a vegetarian vegan
[3412.52 - 3417.12] plant-based they can't beat it they can
[3414.92 - 3418.56] Hammer you with the protein Fe Hammer
[3417.12 - 3421.40] you with the b112
[3418.56 - 3423.76] deficiency they can Hammer you with the
[3421.40 - 3426.84] soy and the
[3423.76 - 3428.72] corn they can Hammer you with the you
[3426.84 - 3430.44] know the oils cuz they took information
[3428.72 - 3433.08] medical medium information like the soy
[3430.44 - 3434.32] corn the the oils they can Hammer you
[3433.08 - 3436.00] with the nutritional yeast they took
[3434.32 - 3437.92] from medical medium I was the first to
[3436.00 - 3440.96] tell you the stuff was dangerous bad and
[3437.92 - 3442.88] crappy and bad for you and everybody was
[3440.96 - 3444.56] just pissed at me I probably lost so
[3442.88 - 3446.80] many followers because I went after
[3444.56 - 3448.92] nutritional yeast because people use
[3446.80 - 3452.12] that like
[3448.92 - 3453.92] crack and the Meat Heads they took that
[3452.12 - 3455.68] information and they have so many
[3453.92 - 3458.08] weapons and they took infertility for
[3455.68 - 3459.80] the women and they took they took the
[3458.08 - 3463.32] whole thing where the soy boys the men
[3459.80 - 3465.20] are feminized and they took all of that
[3463.32 - 3467.24] and they weaponized all these bits in
[3465.20 - 3470.56] pieces and they did a good
[3467.24 - 3472.20] job and they're not even done they're
[3470.56 - 3474.80] not even
[3472.20 - 3478.08] done and they put the last nail in the
[3474.80 - 3479.60] coffin with that fertility crap right
[3478.08 - 3482.96] they knock that one
[3479.60 - 3484.96] in not going to be a lot of women left
[3482.96 - 3487.12] doing plant-based or vegan so they're
[3484.96 - 3488.20] going to be sick either way if they
[3487.12 - 3490.20] don't learn the medical medium
[3488.20 - 3494.24] information this isn't about medical
[3490.20 - 3496.32] medium medical medium is not on either
[3494.24 - 3497.68] side this is just what's happening in
[3496.32 - 3499.16] the world right now I need people to
[3497.68 - 3501.24] know I'm not sitting here trying to
[3499.16 - 3503.20] fight for
[3501.24 - 3504.16] vegans I'm not sitting you're trying to
[3503.20 - 3507.84] fight for
[3504.16 - 3510.40] vegans I'm not
[3507.84 - 3512.32] you can do animal proteins in a way to
[3510.40 - 3514.44] still use medical medium and heal
[3512.32 - 3516.08] they're figuring it out those Meat Heads
[3514.44 - 3517.48] are partially figuring it out they
[3516.08 - 3520.40] brought the fruit
[3517.48 - 3522.96] in they know to stay away from corn and
[3520.40 - 3525.08] soy yeah they know to stay away from all
[3522.96 - 3528.40] the MSG and all the you know weird
[3525.08 - 3530.80] ambiguous places they they're
[3528.40 - 3532.68] learning and they're figuring it out and
[3530.80 - 3534.12] they're getting some benefits from it
[3532.68 - 3535.36] and they're moving forward and they're
[3534.12 - 3537.68] able to get on their social media
[3535.36 - 3539.16] platform and say my skin was yucky I had
[3537.68 - 3542.08] acne now it's getting a little bit
[3539.16 - 3544.36] better and then you got some girl who's
[3542.08 - 3546.96] plant-based who's following this dude's
[3544.36 - 3549.04] account and she's plant-based and her
[3546.96 - 3550.68] acne is blowing up because she doesn't
[3549.04 - 3552.56] know medical medium information about
[3550.68 - 3554.56] how to get rid of acne while you're
[3552.56 - 3556.00] plant-based how you can do that while
[3554.56 - 3557.56] you're plant-based she's not going to
[3556.00 - 3559.92] know that so then she's watching the
[3557.56 - 3561.84] dude and she's just plant-based
[3559.92 - 3567.28] movements just going to be gone I think
[3561.84 - 3569.76] it's probably probably on its last leg
[3567.28 - 3571.76] just in this the rest of this year early
[3569.76 - 3574.36] next year a whole another level
[3571.76 - 3576.28] wonderful wondering wishing says over on
[3574.36 - 3577.80] YouTube aw I finally tried spinach soup
[3576.28 - 3580.52] again oh my God that's such a healing
[3577.80 - 3584.00] tool medical M healing tool but prayed
[3580.52 - 3585.88] to let but I prayed to like it I have
[3584.00 - 3588.12] now had it every day for two weeks in a
[3585.88 - 3589.76] row and love the taste major
[3588.12 - 3591.52] improvements in my health definitely
[3589.76 - 3592.64] Missing Link thank you it is a missing
[3591.52 - 3593.92] link and I want to tell you something
[3592.64 - 3595.80] about the spinach soup the medical beam
[3593.92 - 3597.76] spinach soup I'm going to make it for
[3595.80 - 3599.92] you next live I do because I want to
[3597.76 - 3601.80] show you different like variables that
[3599.92 - 3603.72] make it taste better and how how to do
[3601.80 - 3606.20] it just right and what you can do with
[3603.72 - 3609.00] that what you can do with that it's
[3606.20 - 3612.80] incredible one of the weapons that the
[3609.00 - 3615.84] meat hads used which was being anti
[3612.80 - 3619.36] vegetable and anti- leafy
[3615.84 - 3621.92] green another really good weapon of
[3619.36 - 3623.40] choice against the plant-based people
[3621.92 - 3626.00] because they know that the plant-based
[3623.40 - 3628.28] people are eating their salads and
[3626.00 - 3631.84] plant-based women are eating their
[3628.28 - 3634.88] salads they know that plant-based women
[3631.84 - 3638.08] love salads and they know women love
[3634.88 - 3641.44] salads so another way to really wipe the
[3638.08 - 3644.40] floor clean of the with the plant-based
[3641.44 - 3647.08] movement was to hit the vegetables are
[3644.40 - 3649.96] bad they're toxic here's the reasons why
[3647.08 - 3654.16] out in nature what happens is this
[3649.96 - 3657.04] greens are bad they took that like paleo
[3654.16 - 3659.52] information of vegetables being
[3657.04 - 3660.72] de and they Incorporated it and they
[3659.52 - 3663.76] used it as a weapon against a
[3660.72 - 3667.40] plant-based movement so the plant-based
[3663.76 - 3669.44] girls plant-based women would be like
[3667.40 - 3671.32] well I'm not supposed to be eating these
[3669.44 - 3672.76] vegetables either this dude's saying
[3671.32 - 3675.60] that these things are
[3672.76 - 3677.48] toxic and it's it's another great weapon
[3675.60 - 3680.12] that happened and descended upon the
[3677.48 - 3682.64] plant-based movement now if you don't
[3680.12 - 3685.96] see any of this out there happening it's
[3682.64 - 3690.68] out there happening and it's rampid and
[3685.96 - 3692.48] it is going a mile a minute right now so
[3690.68 - 3694.92] I'm giving you all the different
[3692.48 - 3696.28] variations the understandings of of
[3694.92 - 3697.76] what's Happening kind of how it was
[3696.28 - 3700.08] derived around the time frame it was
[3697.76 - 3703.56] derived what's going on with
[3700.08 - 3706.88] it and you're going to see pretty soon
[3703.56 - 3711.00] all of the fashion companies are not
[3706.88 - 3712.80] going to be offering vegan leather
[3711.00 - 3716.28] pretty soon they're going to be only
[3712.80 - 3718.64] offering one shoe in vegan leather Two
[3716.28 - 3721.80] Shoes in vegan leather you're going to
[3718.64 - 3724.96] see that next year you're G to see
[3721.80 - 3726.92] fashion designers not offering it
[3724.96 - 3729.64] companies and fashion brands not
[3726.92 - 3731.56] offering it you'll see going out to
[3729.64 - 3733.68] pasture is where you're going to see
[3731.56 - 3735.00] that go that's going to be in the next
[3733.68 - 3736.84] coming couple of
[3735.00 - 3741.08] years
[3736.84 - 3743.20] because because veganism is dying
[3741.08 - 3746.64] veganism is practically dead plant-based
[3743.20 - 3747.92] movement is just about on its way
[3746.64 - 3750.64] let's start making some food and I'll
[3747.92 - 3750.64] cover a little bit
[3751.52 - 3760.04] more back to this if you're this is
[3756.32 - 3762.60] important I'm not pining for either
[3760.04 - 3765.04] side I feel bad for the plant-based
[3762.60 - 3767.80] people there's a way to be
[3765.04 - 3772.72] plant-based and there's a way to heal
[3767.80 - 3772.72] there's a way to fix your problems
[3773.44 - 3778.52] plant-based Bela says I've been
[3775.96 - 3781.40] listening to you and reading your books
[3778.52 - 3784.44] for like eight years I see people and
[3781.40 - 3786.32] companies all the time now saying things
[3784.44 - 3788.00] I first heard from you it's so strange
[3786.32 - 3790.00] and that's what they're doing they've
[3788.00 - 3792.16] gone into the medical medium series the
[3790.00 - 3794.24] medical medium Bibles and they poached
[3792.16 - 3796.08] the crap out of them now here's what I
[3794.24 - 3797.80] was supposed to do but I wouldn't
[3796.08 - 3801.16] wouldn't have done it
[3797.80 - 3802.92] anyway so I have people coming to me
[3801.16 - 3804.76] that that because I don't have like I
[3802.92 - 3807.04] don't have PR firms working for me I
[3804.76 - 3808.84] don't do the pr firm thing and you know
[3807.04 - 3811.52] the branding thing you know how I don't
[3808.84 - 3813.24] do that you guys it's it was organic the
[3811.52 - 3814.80] books went out there people healed and
[3813.24 - 3818.28] told somebody
[3814.80 - 3820.08] else so PR marketing firms come up to me
[3818.28 - 3821.60] all the time that like support people's
[3820.08 - 3823.20] brands or you know take on people's
[3821.60 - 3824.92] Brands they knock on my door and they
[3823.20 - 3826.64] say can I get a meeting with aw and I'll
[3824.92 - 3827.80] be like okay if they a pain in the butt
[3826.64 - 3829.40] enough I'll be like what what what do
[3827.80 - 3830.56] you want and they'll talk to me and
[3829.40 - 3834.04] they'll say
[3830.56 - 3836.88] this okay they'll say these things
[3834.04 - 3840.20] they'll say why did you put all that
[3836.88 - 3843.40] information for free in nine books over
[3840.20 - 3845.32] the last 10 years why didn't you take
[3843.40 - 3846.88] pieces of this because it was original
[3845.32 - 3848.60] information it wasn't out there why
[3846.88 - 3850.08] didn't you package and sell each
[3848.60 - 3852.28] individual
[3850.08 - 3854.08] thing and and and you could be a
[3852.28 - 3858.20] billionaire by now they say it all the
[3854.08 - 3860.68] time I say because that's that's that's
[3858.20 - 3862.48] not the way to do it I want to offer
[3860.68 - 3864.40] these books you can go in the library
[3862.48 - 3867.76] and get them for free you can buy one
[3864.40 - 3869.28] for 20 bucks I mean that's free also in
[3867.76 - 3871.00] hundreds and hundreds of live streams
[3869.28 - 3873.08] and podcasts they also poach the
[3871.00 - 3875.04] information and so what happened is what
[3873.08 - 3877.96] you see now is all this early medical
[3875.04 - 3881.12] medium information being weaponized and
[3877.96 - 3883.04] used it is and you see people talking
[3881.12 - 3885.08] about it you see podcast doctors talking
[3883.04 - 3887.32] about it you see it out there right
[3885.08 - 3888.92] exactly they took the info and they're
[3887.32 - 3891.36] using it and they're weedling it into
[3888.92 - 3893.56] their own belief systems like carnivore
[3891.36 - 3895.76] and like keto and like even some
[3893.56 - 3897.64] plant-based people are doing it too but
[3895.76 - 3899.12] plant based people could not save the
[3897.64 - 3901.24] movement because they didn't want to
[3899.12 - 3902.80] know medical medium information
[3901.24 - 3905.56] enough
[3902.80 - 3908.28] Cynthia over there in IG I'm a doctor

[4029.64 - 4034.48] never said don't eat meat I never said
[4031.92 - 4037.48] people are stupid by eating meat I never
[4034.48 - 4037.48] said anything of the
[4037.72 - 4043.32] sort but what I have said all these
[4040.16 - 4045.84] years is if you want to go the meat root
[4043.32 - 4048.08] there's a way to do it you can heal you
[4045.84 - 4050.44] can work on your healing process and you

[4077.32 - 4084.68] death you can eat so much overt fat that
[4081.48 - 4086.76] you can really decline in so many ways
[4084.68 - 4089.04] that's one thing all on its own I mean

[4162.84 - 4167.48] talking about you haven't seen it yet by
[4166.28 - 4171.68] the beginning of
[4167.48 - 4171.68] 2025 the winter of
[4172.84 - 4177.32] 2025 and maybe that's the summer on the
[4175.48 - 4178.28] other side of the planet but the winter
[4177.32 - 4181.24] of
[4178.28 - 4184.72] 2025 would be
[4181.24 - 4188.08] probably the veganism and plant-based
[4184.72 - 4190.44] movement um
[4188.08 - 4192.64] funeral by the winter of
[4190.44 - 4195.68] 2025 that will be the plant-base and
[4192.64 - 4197.92] vegan movement funeral
[4195.68 - 4201.76] there'll be some scraggler left there'll
[4197.92 - 4203.60] be a few a few people left but pretty
[4201.76 - 4206.36] much all
[4203.60 - 4208.76] gone except the medical M Community cuz
[4206.36 - 4211.28] you can be plant-based here and
[4208.76 - 4213.32] heal and like I said you can eat meat
[4211.28 - 4215.08] and heal you got to learn how to do it
[4213.32 - 4217.84] there's ways to do it so this is the
[4215.08 - 4220.28] Millet and Herb salad and now I'm moving

[4297.52 - 4301.48] another thing the Meat Heads have
[4299.40 - 4303.64] adopted for medical medium information
[4301.48 - 4305.80] on how there's basically spray on
[4303.64 - 4308.76] everything and there's metals on
[4305.80 - 4310.92] everything and metals in everything all
[4308.76 - 4313.04] the different tidbits they're
[4310.92 - 4316.88] taking okay so I'm going to chop up this
[4313.04 - 4319.36] cucumber bear with me here
[4316.88 - 4323.84] all you need is about a cup in this
[4319.36 - 4323.84] recipe okay so I'm going to dice these
[4324.72 - 4331.56] up there we go and these like nice
[4327.64 - 4331.56] little like kind of like triangly
[4331.64 - 4336.96] squares you don't want them too thin you
[4335.04 - 4339.32] want them to have a little bit
[4336.96 - 4343.28] of structure to
[4339.32 - 4344.16] them that's how I like it for these
[4343.28 - 4348.44] there we
[4344.16 - 4350.08] go might have a big one in there right
[4348.44 - 4351.28] I'm going to drop this in right here
[4350.08 - 4354.04] what's great about this cutting board
[4351.28 - 4354.04] right here I can do
[4356.32 - 4360.40] this okay next one right
[4362.04 - 4367.48] there okay Victoria rising out of the
[4364.80 - 4369.96] ashes rising from the ashes apologize
[4367.48 - 4373.24] for that what they on YouTube I noticed
[4369.96 - 4376.08] at my local organic store things used to
[4373.24 - 4378.28] cater to a lot of vegans but in the past
[4376.08 - 4381.00] year or more that changed and I didn't
[4378.28 - 4383.96] understand why catering to vegans is
[4381.00 - 4386.52] disappearing absolutely it's definitely
[4383.96 - 4390.00] disappearing farmers markets all
[4386.52 - 4393.12] included it's um and menus too in
[4390.00 - 4395.36] restaurants as well menus are not going
[4393.12 - 4397.44] to cater as much you're going to see
[4395.36 - 4400.88] less and less on the menus there's going
[4397.44 - 4402.60] to be less vegans going into places and
[4400.88 - 4404.96] that's that's the thing and asking for
[4402.60 - 4406.12] things and that's what's happening which
[4404.96 - 4409.12] is is you
[4406.12 - 4411.76] know which is really really annoying for
[4409.12 - 4413.32] so many people because why when I talk
[4411.76 - 4415.84] about truths a lot of people get
[4413.32 - 4419.20] offended and then they're upset and then
[4415.84 - 4421.68] I don't make friends um my podcast
[4419.20 - 4424.00] episodes Don't Make Friends especially
[4421.68 - 4427.88] the one that I'm putting out next week
[4424.00 - 4429.96] you know like there's there's it's like
[4427.88 - 4432.56] yeah a lot of things that I've said over
[4429.96 - 4434.24] these years the fragrance thing right I
[4432.56 - 4436.28] broke the fragrance thing out in the
[4434.24 - 4438.32] world now it's of course getting all
[4436.28 - 4440.52] poached right there's a new person every
[4438.32 - 4443.68] day like fragrances it's always some PhD
[4440.52 - 4447.28] guy or something
[4443.68 - 4450.08] and um and they're like fragrances are
[4447.28 - 4452.32] bad got I'm chopping up some tomato but
[4450.08 - 4455.48] I when I broke the fragrance thing the
[4452.32 - 4457.96] hate man the hate was so thick when you
[4455.48 - 4459.68] break the stuff out first and you teach
[4457.96 - 4462.16] about it and stuff and you message about
[4459.68 - 4464.64] it especially from Spirit like all the
[4462.16 - 4466.88] info oh my God the amount of the hate
[4464.64 - 4469.60] was crazy but then weeks or months or
[4466.88 - 4472.04] years later those same people who were
[4469.60 - 4474.64] hating on me talking crap about me on
[4472.04 - 4476.56] social media they're all using the
[4474.64 - 4479.76] information benefiting it and passing it
[4476.56 - 4479.76] around like they're the
[4480.84 - 4487.64] experts when you do things like that you
[4484.32 - 4491.32] have to reckon with that when you leave
[4487.64 - 4494.00] here I think that's something
[4491.32 - 4496.36] that you know Spirit of compassion told
[4494.00 - 4499.00] me that when I was
[4496.36 - 4501.96] younger that when you purposely do evil
[4499.00 - 4504.64] [ __ ] like that or you purposely do evil
[4501.96 - 4507.24] stuff with intentions behind it you sit
[4504.64 - 4509.56] there and you try to demean and hurt
[4507.24 - 4511.52] someone like you know you you're you're
[4509.56 - 4513.16] you're a medical medium hater you're
[4511.52 - 4515.04] ranking on what he what the medical
[4513.16 - 4517.08] medium is talking about the information
[4515.04 - 4518.56] right and you're ruining people's
[4517.08 - 4521.04] chances of healing because they get
[4518.56 - 4523.20] thrown by it right think about that and
[4521.04 - 4525.04] then a year later two years later 3
[4523.20 - 4526.84] years later you take medical me
[4525.04 - 4528.36] information you never apologize for what
[4526.84 - 4530.52] you've done you never said how you were
[4528.36 - 4533.08] wrong and and Anthony William had it
[4530.52 - 4536.16] right and then you end up using it well
[4533.08 - 4537.72] what happens is when you purposely do
[4536.16 - 4540.52] that
[4537.72 - 4543.60] purposely it's something that has to be
[4540.52 - 4545.92] resolved before you die so when you're
[4543.60 - 4547.52] 80 years old 90 years old 70 years old
[4545.92 - 4548.80] whatever it is 60 years old or whatever
[4547.52 - 4550.80] is going to happen with someone in their
[4548.80 - 4553.92] life and you're on your
[4550.80 - 4556.60] deathbed that gets brought before you
[4553.92 - 4558.36] Spirit of compassion has always told me
[4556.60 - 4562.92] that gets brought before
[4558.36 - 4564.40] you it does and it's basically like you
[4562.92 - 4568.04] remember when you purposely
[4564.40 - 4570.16] intentionally were just evil and you
[4568.04 - 4572.04] thwarted people's healing process and
[4570.16 - 4574.00] you said all these things and then you
[4572.04 - 4577.48] took the information and then you
[4574.00 - 4581.12] benefited from it and never apologized
[4577.48 - 4584.16] and never came clean you remember that
[4581.12 - 4587.48] and you were evil when you did it that
[4584.16 - 4588.96] has to be resolved before you pass on
[4587.48 - 4590.80] and so I see all these people doing that
[4588.96 - 4592.92] and I'm like you think that's just like
[4590.80 - 4595.52] that that's it nothing to worry about
[4592.92 - 4597.20] anymore that's it it's over you totally
[4595.52 - 4599.00] screw me over like that you know you
[4597.20 - 4601.32] tell people this and that you do this
[4599.00 - 4602.16] then you take the info that info comes
[4601.32 - 4604.60] from
[4602.16 - 4607.08] above that info you learned and you're
[4604.60 - 4609.00] spreading around and using against me
[4607.08 - 4611.16] and using for yourself the benefit and
[4609.00 - 4615.20] doing these evil you know these evil
[4611.16 - 4617.96] things that's information that came from
[4615.20 - 4621.32] a Divine Source from
[4617.96 - 4623.96] above you don't think down the road
[4621.32 - 4628.00] there may be some payment for that in a
[4623.96 - 4628.00] on a spiritual level well you'll
[4628.20 - 4632.56] say all right let's get some chopped up
[4630.40 - 4634.80] celery sticks in here a couple celery
[4632.56 - 4637.40] sticks I've been helping people for over
[4634.80 - 4641.24] 35
[4637.40 - 4643.84] years and I have not just U social media
[4641.24 - 4645.52] or anything like that 35 years have been
[4643.84 - 4647.40] helping people
[4645.52 - 4650.24] All Around the
[4647.40 - 4652.40] World Erica Brown a vegan restaurant
[4650.24 - 4656.64] near me is recently no longer vegan they
[4652.40 - 4656.64] started adding meat dishes to their
[4657.36 - 4663.28] menu bye
[4659.44 - 4663.28] bye this American
[4666.80 - 4674.40] Pie JS J jzs funny that you say that
[4671.48 - 4676.96] because I went to Whole Food and they
[4674.40 - 4680.92] stopped making vegan cupcakes and I
[4676.96 - 4680.92] couldn't understand why now I
[4683.24 - 4690.20] know see you later
[4686.64 - 4690.20] alligator see you later
[4691.19 - 4695.20] [Music]
[4692.32 - 4699.84] alligator
[4695.20 - 4702.20] yep it's over all right just in a little
[4699.84 - 4703.92] bit more time okay so I'm going to put a
[4702.20 - 4707.20] little green onion in here really quick
[4703.92 - 4707.20] okay so some green
[4709.12 - 4713.32] onion you guys this dish is really
[4717.72 - 4721.60] delicious if you're a meat eater and
[4720.16 - 4723.12] you're somebody that's on keto or
[4721.60 - 4724.80] whatever and you're watching this and
[4723.12 - 4726.88] you're not sure if you hate me or like
[4724.80 - 4730.20] me even though you you kind of probably
[4726.88 - 4733.84] heard you can do animal products I never
[4730.20 - 4735.76] ripped down meat and ripped it apart and
[4733.84 - 4737.40] attacked people support or anything like
[4735.76 - 4740.36] that have always been supportive if
[4737.40 - 4742.88] you're an animal protein dude or or you
[4740.36 - 4744.48] know person of some kind and you're you
[4742.88 - 4746.92] know you're an animal protein person
[4744.48 - 4749.72] here's what I would do I would make this
[4746.92 - 4751.36] dish I would take the Millet and move
[4749.72 - 4754.84] the Millet out and not use it in this
[4751.36 - 4757.40] dish and I would put a small portion of
[4754.84 - 4760.16] your favorite meat in the dish that's
[4757.40 - 4762.04] what I would do that's all if you're a
[4760.16 - 4764.52] meat eater that's what I would do I
[4762.04 - 4767.68] would not do it with the Millet in there
[4764.52 - 4769.52] I would replace the Millet with the meat
[4767.68 - 4771.60] and I wouldn't use a lot of meat I'd use
[4769.52 - 4774.20] a little bit of meat because the meat is
[4771.60 - 4776.24] an overt fat and you don't want to over
[4774.20 - 4778.96] fat your dish too high you're not going
[4776.24 - 4781.48] to heal if you over fat your dish too
[4778.96 - 4783.52] high and then I would make sure that
[4781.48 - 4785.68] that was pretty much your only meat for
[4783.52 - 4788.36] the day if you're trying to heal if
[4785.68 - 4788.36] you're chronically
[4792.80 - 4798.48] sick all right what else we got cooking
[4795.04 - 4803.60] here um I'm going to um cut up an onion
[4798.48 - 4803.60] a little bit okay let me do
[4803.76 - 4810.24] that see is this an onion that's a good
[4806.36 - 4810.24] onion it is a good onion right
[4816.32 - 4827.12] here another thing too marketing wise
[4822.24 - 4830.80] marketing the meat found a great way to
[4827.12 - 4833.96] Market great techniques great tactics as
[4830.80 - 4835.40] well they really can do a lot of damage
[4833.96 - 4837.16] to the plant-based
[4835.40 - 4838.60] movement the take down of the
[4837.16 - 4841.24] plant-based
[4838.60 - 4844.76] movement was on
[4841.24 - 4847.48] purpose it was to get plant-based people
[4844.76 - 4850.92] to buy their stuff and do their stuff
[4847.48 - 4854.00] buy their protein powders by all their
[4850.92 - 4857.24] things it was to get people that were on
[4854.00 - 4860.52] plant Pro protein powders to go and buy
[4857.24 - 4865.28] the Meat Heads protein
[4860.52 - 4868.44] powders it was a cash cow
[4865.28 - 4869.84] man Cash Cow all right so I put some
[4868.44 - 4872.60] onion in
[4869.84 - 4875.16] there okay and I got some green onion in
[4872.60 - 4877.20] there a little bit of
[4875.16 - 4880.68] onion
[4877.20 - 4882.48] um all right I'm going to mix that up in
[4880.68 - 4886.76] a little bit we're almost
[4882.48 - 4886.76] there I'm going to put some parsley in
[4888.68 - 4894.80] here I got a mix right here of some
[4890.96 - 4894.80] parsley with some cilantro wrapped up
[4898.84 - 4903.12] together so I'm going to chop up this
[4901.04 - 4905.04] parsley right here you can use a lot of
[4903.12 - 4907.96] it you can use a little bit of it I'm
[4905.04 - 4909.68] I'm like a big fan of leafy green herbs
[4907.96 - 4912.88] I've been um talking about that
[4909.68 - 4915.88] messaging that for years that you use
[4912.88 - 4917.96] your green leafy herbs as green leafy
[4915.88 - 4919.44] greens that's what you do with it now
[4917.96 - 4921.88] you can just take some of this and put
[4919.44 - 4925.76] it on top of it at the you know after
[4921.88 - 4925.76] you make it I'm going to mix this
[4927.04 - 4932.64] in but I'm not going to have just um big
[4930.84 - 4934.44] pieces of this I'm going to go with kind
[4932.64 - 4936.28] of
[4934.44 - 4938.84] like there you
[4936.28 - 4941.52] go all
[4938.84 - 4943.44] right I'm going to pop some in now a
[4941.52 - 4945.16] little bit and then I'm going to leave
[4943.44 - 4948.00] some on the side for now
[4945.16 - 4950.00] now all right and then I got some mint
[4948.00 - 4953.12] right here too so let's get some mint in
[4950.00 - 4953.12] here I'm not going to use a lot of
[4955.16 - 4961.20] mint I'm just going to eat a little bit
[4958.20 - 4963.48] of mint today not a lot of it I'm going
[4961.20 - 4964.68] to eat a little bit of it okay there we
[4963.48 - 4967.68] go
[4964.68 - 4971.44] there coming together you guys coming
[4967.68 - 4973.52] together so we got Millet so we can do
[4971.44 - 4976.08] we can do a little bit of millet half
[4973.52 - 4979.04] cup a full cup whatever you would like
[4976.08 - 4982.48] I'm going to do a scoop gauge
[4979.04 - 4985.16] it two cups you can do
[4982.48 - 4990.64] so I'm going to take some freshly cooked
[4985.16 - 4990.64] Millet here it's cooked perfectly too as
[4993.64 - 5000.44] well see what you don't do is you don't
[4997.28 - 5005.48] put an over it fat you don't put oil in
[5000.44 - 5008.04] here with this Millet you don't do that
[5005.48 - 5010.08] you keep you keep the fats
[5008.04 - 5011.88] out and list if you're if you're
[5010.08 - 5013.28] somebody that's you know you just don't
[5011.88 - 5015.16] want to do the Millet you don't have to
[5013.28 - 5016.64] do the Millet do it without the Millet
[5015.16 - 5018.44] if you're a meat eater take the Millet
[5016.64 - 5020.48] out replace it with some meat but do it
[5018.44 - 5021.72] the way I was talking about going to put
[5020.48 - 5023.24] a little bit more here cuz I want
[5021.72 - 5025.00] roughly around two cups so I'm going to
[5023.24 - 5027.20] put a little bit more in here there you
[5025.00 - 5032.00] go see how that
[5027.20 - 5032.00] looks nice looking real
[5032.72 - 5036.44] good give it a good mix
[5036.72 - 5041.04] I think it's got a great balance of
[5038.44 - 5041.04] everything in
[5042.04 - 5048.00] there I can put it in a different
[5045.20 - 5050.76] Bowl Millet is one of my favorite grains
[5048.00 - 5054.76] it's a grain that can help you heal it
[5050.76 - 5056.56] can offers a lot of nutrition a lot of
[5054.76 - 5058.56] phytochemical
[5056.56 - 5061.44] compounds it's not that you should be un
[5058.56 - 5063.56] Mill it every day it's one of these
[5061.44 - 5064.88] things though you can use as a tool if
[5063.56 - 5068.52] you use it just
[5064.88 - 5071.72] right if you mix Millet with a whole
[5068.52 - 5074.76] bunch of oil and a whole bunch of nut
[5071.72 - 5079.08] butter or tahini it's not a good it's
[5074.76 - 5082.92] not a good use of it if you're
[5079.08 - 5086.92] healing cweed hero says no radical
[5082.92 - 5089.56] fat just conservative fat really
[5086.92 - 5091.44] smart so yeah so there we go I made the
[5089.56 - 5093.20] dish I made it in this bowl I could set
[5091.44 - 5096.44] it up in a different Bowl though
[5093.20 - 5101.00] potentially make it kind of look look
[5096.44 - 5101.00] okay uh you can do it in different ways
[5103.00 - 5107.96] here and maybe I can even do this really
[5108.44 - 5112.68] quick can do something like this
[5115.76 - 5119.80] too and what you can do is just
