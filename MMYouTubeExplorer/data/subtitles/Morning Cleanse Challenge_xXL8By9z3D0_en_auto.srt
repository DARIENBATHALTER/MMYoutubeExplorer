we do

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,200
is we don't do a liver flushing routine

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
everybody thinks their liver is fine

77
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,239
they think their liver may not be

78
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,599
needing a flush or a cleaning

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
and the medical medium warning cleanse

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,640
helps to clean our liver every single

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,519
day every single morning and it's so

82
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,120
important to get us better to get us to

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800

86
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,599
poisons that age us

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,760
fast and nobody nobody wants to talk

88
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,760
about aging until they start aging

89
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,440
that's the other thing too and so they

90
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,239

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560

so important you guys are live on

237
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
facebook live on youtube

live on tick tock live on clubhouse

239
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,840
right now

240
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,440
that's amazing that's fantastic so happy

241
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
to hear so happy to hear

242
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
so people are doing their chocolate in

243
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
the morning cacao nibs they're doing

244
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,120
their cacao powder they're doing in

245
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
smoothies

246
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,360
and these are what everybody's being

247
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
told they're healthy fats right

248
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,479
you got your almonds and here's your

249
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,639
walnuts too

250
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
so we got our walnuts right there

251
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,080
another healthy fat

252
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,319
look at that right now when it comes

253
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,639
down to the chocolate the cacao

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,840
and the cacao powder it's not a healthy

255
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,240
fat really

256
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
because basically that caffeine just

257
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,000
annihilates any real health benefit you

258
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
can get from chocolate because caffeine

259
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,360
really just

260
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
ages as quickly but there's no caffeine

261
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959
in walnuts

262
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,640
so you got that so the walnut butter

263
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,080
handful of walnuts right i mean that's

264
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
not a bad thing at all

265
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
but if you're doing it in the morning

266
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
you won't

267
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,160
cleanse you just won't and the medical

268
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
media morning cleanse is something you

269
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,839
can do and

270
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,200
live your life doing so you can get

271
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,959
back on track but here's the thing and

272
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
everybody's doing other things too

273
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,080
they're doing their bacon in the morning

274
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
so they're doing their bacon right

275
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,760
they're doing that so say someone's like

276
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,600
well hey look i don't do any carbs i

277
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,920
don't have the pancakes

278
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
i'm on the bacon every single morning

279
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,120
i'm on the eggs every single morning

280
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,839
that's healthy

281
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
people think that's healthy and you're

282
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,920
just not going to cleanse

283
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
you're just not so you can't cleanse the

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
liver

285
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,160
you can't get the toxins out of your

286
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
body and i know people are worried about

287
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
the lymphatic system

288
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
where you're not going to be able to

289
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
purge your lymphatic system if you're

290
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,880
having

291
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,959
fat in the morning so if you do your

292
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,720
coconut oil and your almond butter

293
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,120
and your peanut butter in the morning

294
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,839
between before noon especially before

295
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,160
noon and you're doing you're doing your

296
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
cacao in the morning before noon

297
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,240
you're not cleaning up your lymphatic

298
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,920
system it can't clean up

299
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,360
and you're not cleaning up the liver

300
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680
it's really important to know

301
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
joseph says celery juice completely got

302
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,880

and nothing else could get rid over

306
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,519
three years

307
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,839
of trying everything to do since

getting you got everything better

313
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
also the rust looking spots in my legs

314
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
that started appearing

315
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,760
wow that's so good so good so important

316
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,200
so look if you do your bacon in the

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
morning you do your sausage you do your

318
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
eggs in the morning we get in trouble

319
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,600
that's right there say you're somebody

320
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
that's that's trying to do something

321
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
else like

322
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
say you got your gluten-free bagel right

323
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,560
you got your gluten-free bagel in the

324
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
morning you got your

325
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,480
organic cream cheese in the morning

326
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
you're not gonna cleanse

327
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
it's just not going to happen why do we

328
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
have to cleanse you guys we have to get

329
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
rid of poisons and toxins we got to get

330
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
them out of her body every day

331
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
they just build up and they wreak havoc

332
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
so that when you get

333
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,120
sick someday you don't get better no

334
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
one's teaching you how to get better

335
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,560
the reason why intermittent fasting

336
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,160
gives

337
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
people some relief

338
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
is because intermittent fasting is

339
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,839
getting rid of the fats in the morning

340
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
that's why so when people intermittent

341
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
fast

342
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
that's everybody's being forced

343
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,079
intermittent fast that's what's

344
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,880
happening right now

345
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,399
the younger generations are being forced

346
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,240
to intermittent fast because they can't

347
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
keep their weight off

348
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,440
they can't keep their weight off their

349
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
livers are all stagnant

350
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
and sluggish and that's what's happening

351
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
right there okay

352
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,160
and so an intermittent fasting is not an

353
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
answer

354
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
it's not an answer because what happens

355
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,440
is you blow out your adrenals when you

356
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
do your intermittent fasting

357
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,079
you blow your adrenals out that's what

358
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,480
happens along the way keep that in mind

359
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,240
so it's all cute it's all fun it's all

360
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,959
games at first with the intermittent

361
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,880
fasting

362
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,959
wow i'm feeling a little better let me

363
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,560
get on my let me get on my caffeine let

364
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
me do that i'm intermittent fasting let

365
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,040
me make sure i'm drinking my coffee

366
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,320
let me do that intermittent fasting is

367
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,560
working for me so good

368
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,079
i'm high on coffee all day high in

369
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,440
coffee all morning let me do my

370
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
intermittent fasting

371
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,120
i'm losing weight i'm feeling some

372
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,720
energy back and the reason why

373
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,800
is because you stopped doing

374
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
the fats in the morning you stopped

375
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,240
eating your eggs in the morning

376
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
you stopped eating your bacon in the

377
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,360
morning and that's what happened with

378
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
the intermittent fasting it's like wait

379
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,600
a minute

380
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,360
intermittent fasting is like the holy

381
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
grail or something but really what they

382
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,720
don't understand

383
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,040
is they stop eating the fats and they

384
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,360
stop killing their liver in the morning

385
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,839
that's what happened they stopped

386
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,440
killing their livers

387
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
and so people are being forced

388
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
intermittent fast and that's not the

389
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,519
answer

390
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,800
this is this isn't a pro intermittent

391
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,000

lighting in front of me the lights are

404
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,800
so bright for some reason today

405
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,760
so it's it's like the comments get

406
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,079
kind of like whited out write it out but

407
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,120
uh

408
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,760
thanks for leaving the comments

409
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,040
incredible intermittent fasting hurt me

410
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,600
i just saw that

411
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,200
so intermittent fasting what it does is

412
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
it burns out the adrenals

413
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,800
and it does hurt us over time when

414
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
you're younger you can pull it off it's

415
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,440
like just do the caffeine

416
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,079
stay high all day long and then take

417
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,560
that big

418
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,440
fatty meal at the end of the day right

419
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,440
and you'll notice

420
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
you'll start to slim down a little bit

421
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,120
your belly goes in a little bit

422
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,839
you start to you start to lose some

423
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,320
weight so intermittent fasting seems to

424
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
be

425
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
the greatest thing but it's really a

426
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
mistake

427
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,880
a bad mistake so what you do when you

428
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
intermittent fast you burn out your

429
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,920
adrenals you trash them

430
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,760
along the way and so there's something

431
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
better we can do

432
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
because you can't just live on

433
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
adrenaline you can't be doing this

434
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
intermittent fasting and just living on

435
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
adrenaline and living on adrenaline your

436
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,519
adrenals right there

437
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,199
right just running on adrenaline so it's

438
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
like hey i'm intermittent fasting let me

439
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,440
do a coffee coffee coffee

440
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,279
not eating not eating not eating and

441
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
matcha tea much tea not eating and just

442
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,519
blowing out your adrenals

443
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,120
and that's not the way to do things

444
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
that's not the correct way to do things

445
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,760
the right way to do things

446
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720

467
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,320
it because your guys are gonna eat fat

468
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,800
anyway i'd rather have you eat avocados

469
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
instead of an animal protein eggs milk

470
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,000

472
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,519
by the way

473
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
butter radical fat so if you're going to

474
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,519

use avocado right but you know you've

476
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,560
heard that before you're just you're

477
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,600
just you've heard that before

478
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,440
use avocado as butter okay 35 years ago

479
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,639
i couldn't get anybody to use avocado as

480
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
butter

481
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,519
i mean i got laughed off of lecture

482
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,399
stages for saying avocado was good for

483
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,279
you

484
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,040
30 plus years ago people would be like

485
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,519
avocados poisonous

486
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
you'll get a heart attack eating avocado

487
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,519
that's what everybody thought

488
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,320
doctors thought avocado was toxic just

489
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
so you know

490
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,799
fats since you were a child that's how

665
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,840
it's done

666
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,840
we're taught to crank the fats up

667
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,799
lots of overt fats i call them radical

668
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,159
fats

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,760

670
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,039
the fat we feel like we can't live

671
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,400
without it so i'm going to answer a

672
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
couple questions that are common

673
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,880
one is if i can't have my fats in the

674
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,919
morning

675
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,919

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,919
right my walnuts my eggs

677
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
my bacon my avocado if i can't have my

678
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
fats

679
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,200
in the morning how am i gonna keep my

680
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
blood sugar stable

681
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,400
you're having blood sugar issues the

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,760
answer's in your hands already

683
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
it's because of the fats it's

684
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,410
because of the fats elizabeth could see

685
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
it

686
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,200
[Music]

687
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,280
it's because of the fats that's why

688
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
your blood sugar is unstable to begin

689
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,120
with because your diet is so loaded in

690
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,679
fat what that means is your

691
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,720
pancreas is weakening

692
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,600
that's what that means your pancreas

693
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,799
is weakening that means your adrenals

694
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,360
are weakening

695
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:42,320
if you got blood sugar problems

696
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,760
that's because you've had insulin

697
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,200
resistance

698
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,679
for years you guys

699
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,799
so if you're someone that's scared to

700
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,159
death

701
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:56,240
of going fat free in the morning or fat

702
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
free during a day because you think

703
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,840
you're gonna have blood sugar

704
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,720
instability

705
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,279
then you're someone that already has a

706
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,120
weak

707
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,840
pancreas from fats

708
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
see what i mean you're already getting

709
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,799
injured

710
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,320
from your high fat diet and that's

711
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,480
how it rolls

712
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,320
if you're dealing with that if you're at

713
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
the doctor's office the doctor's like

714
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,720

you got your a1c is is moving around

718
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:42,320

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,760
the nuts and nut butters cat beard

725
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,080

726
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,200
when i started eating fruit and veggies

727
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,080
and cut out the fats i felt so much

728
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,799
better and quickly i stopped having what

729
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,480
i thought

730
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,320
were hypoglycemic episodes it means the

731
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,400
fats you've been consuming all these

732
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,240
years

733
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,039
are starting to beat down the pancreas

734
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,400
starting to take out the pancreas that's

735
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,880
what it means

736
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,559
regina says i've been doing that morning

737
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,279

that's how it rolls so look you guys

743
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,760
what i've noticed is

744
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,840
once people learn this information once

745
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,760
they actually learn the information

746
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,400
it's endless what they can do and that's

747
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,880
what they can do get their lives back

748
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,000

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,880
gone amazing that's incredible it really

765
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
is

766
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
so when people don't realize you guys is

767
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
they're living with insulin resistance

768
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,000
every single day

769
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,200
every single day for living with insulin

770
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,279
resistance

771
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
that's what they're up against insulin

772
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,279
resistance is

773
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,240
the big one right there their pancreas

774
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,400
is maxed out

775
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,200
every single day their pancreas is

776
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,760
hurting every single day

777
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
this is a we're in like part of the

778
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,200
medical meeting morning puns right now

779
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
i'm doing a little celery juice

780
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,880
i didn't do celery juice yet today

781
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,240
anyway

782
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
so this is great i'm excited

783
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
i was like you know what i'll do it

784
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,400
later on i'll have some celery juice

785
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
later on

786
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,760
so insulin resistance

787
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,919
means your pancreas and your adrenals

788
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,720
are getting weak it also means your

789
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,279
liver is stagnant sluggish and getting

790
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
weak

791
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,559
and i don't know why anybody would want

792
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
that maybe they just don't know they

793
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,919
have it right maybe they just don't know

794
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,480
they have the problem

795
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,240
but they do they do have it so we're

796
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,559
going to do some celery juice constraint

797
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,880
you have to strain the celery juice

798
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,799
it's critical you got to get all the

799
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
pulp out you got to get all the fiber

800
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,000
out right

801
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,559
i still get blown away at this at this

802
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,880
machine

803
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,399
you know the pulp is dry it's in my

804
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,320
hands right here it's a little bit of

805
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,799
pulp it's nice and dry

806
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,520
i just love that what that means if you

807
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,000
guys have the mm-900 hds it's only this

808
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,000

810
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,880

811
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480

813
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,240

816
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,760

817
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,840

962
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,440
it's kind of interesting when you think

963
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,000

964
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,480
sudden

965
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,399
a heavy metal expert when they didn't

966
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,039

967
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,279

the only way to get the metals out

970
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
okay is making sure you got the wild

971
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,720
blueberries in there which we did

972
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,159

977
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,720
dolce gotta have your cilantro in there

978
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,320

i'm gonna put a little extra wild

980
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,000
blueberry powder

981
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,919

982
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,240

983
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,200

986
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,520
let's do that

987
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280

let's get that in there i like to put a

989
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,839
little extra

990
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,440
doing that barley grass juice powder

991
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,639
that's another great way of getting the

992
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,160
metals out you have to have the five

993
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,560
ingredients and if you don't have the

994
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,320
full

995
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,000
five ingredients and you have three out

996
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,400
of the five you can get some

997
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,119

998
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
five

999
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,960
that's the way to really accelerate it

1000
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,560
quicker right now i have the capsules i

1001
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,160

actually let me get the waffle started

1131
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,040
and then i'm gonna make a quick fruit

1132
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,200
bowl

1133
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,119

1134
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,720
tell you guys

1135
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:40,160
i'm excited getting better

1136
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,319
is exciting getting better

1137
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,280
is a great thing so i'm popping some of

1138
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,280
the skins off of this right here okay

1139
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
so what i'm doing is i'm taking some of

1140
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
these potato skins off you don't have to

1141
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,119
take them off if you don't want to for

1142
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,240
your waffles

1143
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,760
potatoes become a problem

1144
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,040
when you mix oil fat nut butter in there

1145
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,760
grease when you stick eggs in there when

1146
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,359
you stick

1147
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,680
when you stick um any kind of oil in

1148
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
there

1149
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,400
butter cheese on a potato then

1150
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,319
potato is a problem but it's not

1151
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,839
necessarily a problem it's the butter

1152
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,520
that's a problem it's the cheese that's

1153
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
the problem and that's where the problem

1154
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,720
really lies

1155
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,599
i'm gonna make potato waffles it's a

1156
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,720
great one

1157
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,119
i really like potato waffles um i think

1158
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,760
it's

1159
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,079
what happens is it it's shocking for a

1160
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,599
lot of people to do

1161
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,200
say a morning cleanse where they're

1162
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,480
doing celery juice and they're doing

1163
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,720
lemon water

1164
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,560
and they're doing the heavy metal detox

1165
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,839
smoothie it might be hard for somebody

1166
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,560
to imagine

1167
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,000
that that's going to get them by so many

1168
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
people i know that if they're just

1169
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
starting out too they're going to be

1170
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,720
like i need something more hearty i need

1171
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,280
something more satiating because i'm

1172
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,000
used to three four eggs in the morning

1173
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,240
aw so what are you gonna do for me then

1174
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,079
cause i'm used to a whole bunch of eggs

1175
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,160
i'm used to like toast i'm saying well

1176
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,839
why don't we do some waffles and what

1177
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,280
you're going to find with the waffles

1178
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,240
these ones right here is you're going to

1179
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,599
find they're fat

1180
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,240
free that's the key to avoiding

1181
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,560
insulin resistance that's the key to not

1182
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,400
getting your blood sugar unstable if

1183
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,440
your blood sugar is unstable

1184
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,920
and your hypoglycemia happening or

1185
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,560
you're hypoglycemic or you're

1186
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,560
hyperglycemic

1187
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,119
then you've got a pancreas problem and

1188
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,440
you're on the edge of diabetes

1189
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,359
because your pancreas is basically

1190
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,079
saying you know what i'm done

1191
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,800
you fat at me to death i'm giving up

1192
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,599
soon

1193
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,520
so that's how it works okay so doing

1194
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,839
this can save pancreases i can't tell

1195
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,880
you how many pancreases have been saved

1196
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:46,720
through medical medium protocols so i

1197
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,240
think a pancreas is worth saving what do

1198
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,920
you guys think on clubhouse you think a

1199
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,680
pancreas is worth saving

1200
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,079
what do you guys think on tick tock

1201
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,760
pancreas is worth saving

1202
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,599
here's what happens when you get insulin

1203
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,200
resistance this is important information

1204
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,880
while i'm peeling these potatoes right

1205
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,560
here these beautiful potatoes these are

1206
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,720
steamed potatoes they're already cooked

1207
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,800
they're steamed

1208
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,359
what happens is that glucose is how you

1209
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,560
get your nutrients

1210
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,319
into your cells if that's in the way

1211
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
you can't get glucose into your cells

1212
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,040
easy and you can't get all your

1213
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,200
nutrients into your cells

1214
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,520
you can be taking all your your your

1215
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,640
supplements from your practitioners you

1216
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,400
can take all your

1217
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,560
all your different supplements all your

1218
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,319
different stuff and what happens is

1219
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,079
you can you're spending all this money

1220
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,760
on all your supplementation

1221
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,680
and it's not getting to where it needs

1222
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,200
to go you have to have

1223
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,240
sugar take in a nutrient into a cell

1224
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,880
you can't have a nutrient enter your

1225
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,400
cells

1226
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,079
unless sugar's driving it in and then if

1227
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,760
you're tanking the fats

1228
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,119
you got the eggs you got the bacon you

1229
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,720
got the nut butters in the morning you

1230
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,359
got the avocado toast in the morning

1231
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,440
you're not gonna

1232
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,880
you can if you're in the morning you

1233
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,240
keep on taking your supplements in the

1234
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
morning right let me take all my

1235
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,680
multivitamins my gut health products

1236
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,319
supplements my probiotics let me take

1237
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,839
everything

1238
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,760
i'm taking let me take all my my calcium

1239
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,880
let me take let me get all it in the

1240
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
morning right

1241
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,000
when you do that and you're still having

1242
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,000
your avocado toast let me kind of have

1243
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,359
my avocado toast with it too

1244
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,079
if you do that what's going to happen is

1245
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,200
only a fraction a tiny fraction of the

1246
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,000
supplements are ever going to get

1247
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,040
anywhere

1248
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
only a tiny fraction of those

1249
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,319
supplements

1250
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,599
are going to get anywhere into your

1251
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,079
cells because

1252
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,920
the fat from the avocado toast even

1253
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,520
though avocados are healthy fat

1254
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,119
even though it's a healthy fat the fat

1255
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,319
from the avocado toast

1256
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,400
won't allow the sugar to drive in all

1257
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,119
those nutrients into your cells

1258
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,160
do you see how it works and this is

1259
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,920
important to know

1260
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,440
so i'm just mashing up these potatoes

1261
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,240
right here okay

1262
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,319
that's what i'm doing here's an option

1263
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,839
you can do oatmeal in the morning

1264
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,680
you can do that if you're somebody

1265
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,760
that's like whoa i can't exist on the

1266
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,960
heavy metal detox smoothie i can't exist

1267
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,800
on a celery juice

1268
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,160
in the morning i can't do this medical

1269
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,560
medium morning cleanse

1270
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,760
i need something denser because you've

1271
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,000
been trained

1272
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,240
in such a way to have something much

1273
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,400
more denser right

1274
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,319
and your oatmeal usually has butter in

1275
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,079
it it usually has peanut butter in it it

1276
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,480
has nut butters it has nut milk in it

1277
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,040
right

1278
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,280
so then you feel satiated you feel like

1279
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,319
you're keeping your blood sugar balanced

1280
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,560
but it's smoking mirrors your pancreas

1281
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,480
is

1282
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,720
it's throwing out that insulin it's

1283
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,160
killing itself to throw out that insulin

1284
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,560
when you have all that fat with your

1285
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,680
oatmeal so what you can do you guys

1286
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,359
you can have fat free oatmeal oatmeal

1287
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,960
itself has fat inside of it

1288
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,119
every single fruit and vegetable has fat

1289
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,480
inside of it everything does

1290
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,880
fat is in everything but added fat overt

1291
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,440
fat

1292
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,599
radical fat adding it is another story

1293
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,839
you can have your oatmeal without adding

1294
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,440
avocado without adding nut butters

1295
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,720
without adding nut milks

1296
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:59,599
you can have your

1297
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,520
oatmeal without adding anything right

1298
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,280
i'm making a lot of waffle mix right now

1299
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,880
this is way more than i know that waffle

1300
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,800
maker can take

1301
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,800
so i'm just mashing up a lot right here

1302
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:16,880
so this information okay

1303
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,040

the bottom line is when you're fat free

1310
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,400
in the morning if you do some oatmeal

1311
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,520
you can do some millet that's an option

1312
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,640
right there

1313
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,160
now here's here's a trick to learn don't

1314
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,359
do the dried

1315
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,560
fruit in the morning

1316
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,119
don't do the dried fruit it takes a lot

1317
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,000
for the body to extract the sugar and

1318
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,280
break it down

1319
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,520
out of dried fruit it's not living water

1320
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,319
you can't flush the liver easy

1321
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,400
with dried fruit in the morning yes you

1322
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,720
can have it if it's all you got

1323
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,400
if all you got is some raisins it's all

1324
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,640
you have

1325
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,520
yep you can have it in the morning but i

1326
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,920
recommend not

1327
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,359
i recommend keeping your dried fruit out

1328
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,200
of your morning

1329
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,200
you know i mean that's what i recommend

1330
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,560
so just mashing some potatoes right now

1331
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,440
because we're going to make some waffles

1332
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:26,559
and we've got some maple syrup here too

1333
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:29,119
maple syrup is beneficial

1334
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,800
when there's no fat and butter there's

1335
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,440
no butter involved

1336
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,359
so maple syrup has a problem when

1337
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,000
there's butter involved so here's how it

1338
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,319
works right

1339
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,760
so i got some pancakes right there okay

1340
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,480
you see maple syrup on top of the

1341
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,760
pancake

1342
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,119
but you also see a pat of butter on top

1343
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,559
of the pancake

1344
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:51,760
it's the butter and the maple syrup

1345
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,240
together

1346
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,160
that become the problem right there

1347
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,079
maple syrup's great

1348
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,520
may we need maple syrup to get into our

1349
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,319
cells we need honey to get into our

1350
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,079
cells

1351
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:04,720
right we need fruit to get into our

1352
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,800
cells but what happens is the butter

1353
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,559
stops it from working and then our

1354
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,760
pancreas is spilling out all this

1355
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,800
insulin

1356
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,839
and the butter gets in the way keep it

1357
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,559
fat free in the morning

1358
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,319
guys this information is so important

1359
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,720
all right so

1360
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,440
we've got a little waffle mix which is

1361
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,720
some mashed potatoes

1362
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,079
there we go looking good doing a quicker

1363
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:35,200

they told that's not how they work um

1478
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,040
so being

1479
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,640
vegan or plant-based is not an answer

1480
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,280
it's not an answer

1481
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:56,720
being healthy keto clean animal protein

1482
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:00,880
carb free is not an answer it's not an

1483
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:04,559
answer being carnivore not an answer

1484
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,359
it's not being pescetarian

you're going to have dates in the

1531
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559

throw the dates in the smoothie and

1537
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,160

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,400
if you don't clean up your liver your

1647
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,599
lymphatic system is going to perpetually

1648
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,280

you're just you're going to be in a

1658
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,640
phantom world of thinking you're

1659
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,480
cleaning up your lymphatic system when

1660
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,839
your liver is still clogged and dirty

1661
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,280

1663
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,040
going to get your lymphatic system

1664
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,799

1746
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:44,319
uh great md incredible md so

1747
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,720
what happens is that people have to

1748
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,440
understand is that your lymphatic system

1749
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,160
is not

1750
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,799
your gut gut okay yeah it wraps around

1751
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,880
your gut

1752
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:55,760
all your torso it goes down into your

1753
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,920
thighs it goes into your armpits your

1754
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,760
lymphatic system travels everywhere

1755
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,599
and the majority of your lymphatic

1756
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,920
system is the center

1757
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,599
of your body so everybody says oh well

1758
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,839
the gut's where all your immune system

1759
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,000
is but first of all

1760
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,000
that that's completely wrong how that

1761
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,839
works your immune system is all in your

1762
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,720
bloodstream the second place your immune

1763
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,160
system is

1764
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,920
is your spleen the third place your

1765
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,319
immune system is

1766
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,920
right is your lymphatic system your

1767
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,799
bones that's a place for your immune

1768
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,720
system too

1769
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,799
so it's all these other options but the

1770
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,559
bloodstream is where the majority of

1771
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,599
your immune system is at

1772
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:33,920
it's in your bloodstream okay and

1773
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,280
the what they confuse everybody with

1774
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,960
everybody thinks i'm going to take a

1775
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,240
probiotic because the immune system's

1776
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,839
all in my gut but what they don't

1777
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,440
understand it's not in the lining of

1778
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,160
your intestinal tract so your immune

1779
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,119
system

1780
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,640
is not in the lining of your intestinal

1781
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,440
tract you got to know that your immune

1782
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,680
system is not

1783
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,000
inside your colon so i'm going to remove

1784
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,640
a part of this colon right here

1785
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,599
let me remove this okay see if it can

1786
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,640
come out

1787
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:00,079
stomach came out the liver just came out

1788
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,000
hey we got a liver in our hands that's

1789
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,400
good i'm going to need that for a second

1790
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,319
talk about that most of your immune

1791
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,160
system is in your bloodstream

1792
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,760
this alone kind of makes everything just

1793
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,079
fall apart out there

1794
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,200
you wonder why years of alternative

1795
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,520
medicine

1796
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,400
and nobody getting better that's what

1797
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,000
happened out there

1798
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,440
i watched it for decades years of

1799
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,960
alternative medicine people saying you

1800
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,119
got candida women

1801
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,400
being carried into doctor's offices

1802
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,599
because their fatigue was so bad they

1803
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,920
couldn't even speak

1804
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,599
or sit up and they'd be like you got

1805
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,319
candida that's why you're that sick

1806
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,839
years of women suffering right and then

1807
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,200
here we go the greatest alternative

1808
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,920
medicine we have now

1809
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,520

01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,839
system but let's be straight out and

1848
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,760
i'll call it the lymphatic system let's

1849
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,359
not make everybody think you can swallow

1850
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,799
a probiotic and for some reason you're

1851
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,960
going to have an immune system develop

1852
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:06,160
inside your colon

1853
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,520
it doesn't work okay it doesn't work

1854
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,839
like that

1855
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,839
so

1856
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:16,400
the misinformation is so great out there

1857
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,839
that there's nowhere to see like there's

1858
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,920
no way to escape it

1859
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,760
there's so much misinformation just the

1860
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,119
simple simplicity of this one

1861
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,640
the chickenpox virus is the shingles

1862
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,680
virus no it's not they're two separate

1863
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,599
viruses

1864
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,599
so if we have a medical system that

1865
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,039
can't get one thing right

1866
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,720
alternative and conventional how is

1867
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,240
anybody gonna see straight

1868
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,480
where's the sensibility going to be

1869
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,680
where's where's any of it going to be

1870
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,119

1890
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,200

16 to 32 ounces of lemon water upon

1893
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,880
waking

1894
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,280
wait at least 15 to 30 minutes then

1895
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,000
work on that celery juice 16 to 32

1896
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,599
ounces of straight

1897
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
celery juice because you want those

1898
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,640
mineral salts the sodium cluster salts

1899
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
to bind onto the toxins to get into the

1900
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,119
liver

1901
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,480
and do what they need to do

1902
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,880
you want that you can consume fruits

1903
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,880
after 15 to 30 minutes after your celery

1904
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,359
juice you can consume fruits

1905
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,839
which you can which is an example right

1906
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:57,680
here here's a fruit bowl papaya banana

1907
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:00,480
right in my hands

1908
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,039
crack open some oranges do that if you

1909
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,079

1910
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,000
okay crack open some oranges you can do

1911

1912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,520
heavy metal detox movie is really a

1913
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,039
great

1914
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,720
way of doing it so what i would do is a

1915
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,640
16 to 32 ounces of

1916
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,799
of lemon water first thing upon waking

1917
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,839
i'd wait 15 to 30 minutes hit the celery

1918
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,000
juice

1919
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,760
16 to 30 000 celery's wait a little

1920
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,440
while and i would go into the heavy

1921
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,160
metal detox smoothie that's what i would

1922
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,119
do

1923
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,640
right and if you need to do a bowl of

1924
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,839
fruit like i said you can do a bowl of

1925
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,160
fruit that's fine

1926
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:34,880
if you need something heavier i'm making

1927
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,839
it right here it's a fat free option

1928
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,440
that i'm making right now i got it

1929
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:42,079
inside the waffle

1930
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,480
maker it's a potato waffle you can do

1931
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:47,359
millet as an option

1932
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,119
you can do um oatmeal as an option but

1933
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:52,079
keep the nut milks off

1934
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,160
keep the avocado away if you want to do

1935
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,359
a piece of gluten-free toast and that's

1936
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,440
what you want to do

1937
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:58,960
do a gluten-free piece of toast if

1938
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,720
that's what you want to do

1939
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:06,400
keep the avocado butter off of it

1940
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:08,240
in the morning keep away from eggs

1941
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,000
keep away from eggs too i'm going to see

1942
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,359
if this is done

1943
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,920
so i'm giving you all the different

1944
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:17,199
options you can do additional water you

1945
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,600
can do 16 ounces of water and you can do

1946
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:21,120
16 ounces of coconut water some people

1947
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,319
aren't going to have the coconut water

1948
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:27,520
so you can do more water which is fine

1949
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,640
but drink another 16 ounces of coconut

1950
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,000
water if you can

1951
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,040
or minimum 16 ounces of water keep away

1952
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,719
the dried fruit

1953
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,319
it's okay if some is in there if that's

1954
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,920
what you want to do you're still ahead

1955
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:40,080
of the game because there's no fats

1956
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,440
going on but try to stay away from it

1957
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:46,480
and don't consume radical fats before

1958
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:49,600
noon if you keep up this practice you

1959
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:53,279
move ahead you move ahead

1960
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:56,560

1968
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:14,080
hot let me get a plate

1969
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,839
patricia says wow i thought almond milk

1970
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:19,359
was healthy

1971
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,719
almond milk isn't how it it is a healthy

1972
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,279
option

1973
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:28,400
avocado is a healthy option

1974
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,239
nut butter is a healthy option

1975
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,319
i know this is hard for a lot of people

1976
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:35,359
it is okay

1977
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,040
walnuts are a healthy option almonds are

1978
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,120
a healthy option

1979
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,640
okay coconut water by the way i'm going

1980
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,480
to talk about that in a second don't do

1981
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:45,600
the pink coconut water right

1982
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,239
peanut butter is a healthy option if

1983
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,359
it's the

1984
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,839
really good stuff right not the not the

1985
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:55,199
junk

1986
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:58,400
right but those are healthy options

1987
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:01,520
but when you do them in the morning or

1988
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,280
late morning you won't cleanse and you

1989
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,600
won't go through that you won't go to

1990
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,320
the finish line to heal

1991
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,360
that's the problem have your avocado or

1992
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,400

01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,520
has a more concentrated amount of fat

2028
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,360
versus just

2029
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:38,960
eating oatmeal yes gianna it does

2030
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:40,480
spot on so i got these waffles right

2031
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,600
here now i'm going to put a little maple

2032
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,760
syrup on here this is

2033
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,520
say someone wants something heavier just

2034
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,280
like say oatmeal in the morning keep the

2035
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,159
radical fats off what you won't see here

2036
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,800
is butter

2037
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:52,080
you won't see avocado on these waffles

2038
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,280
you're not going to see that i'm

2039
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,239
dropping some

2040
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,120
some maple syrup on i'm putting a lot of

2041
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:59,600
it on

2042
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,840
because it's perfectly fine you're not

2043
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,120
going to get insulin resistance

2044
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,159
if you don't put on the milk cheese

2045
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,800
butter whatever it is the avocado you

2046
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:12,159
don't do that

2047
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,159
you got your waffles right there

2048
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,840
the key is to learn how to live your

2049
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,480
life

2050
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,080
and gaining energy from healing and not

2051
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,760
from caffeine

2052
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:26,800
not from caffeine abusing your adrenals

2053
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:31,120
that's a big key right there you don't

2054
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,120
want energy from caffeine

2055
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,239
abusing your adrenals you don't want to

2056
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,199
be doing the caffeine and living on that

2057
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,239
all your life

2058
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,640
and then the the caffeine causing your

2059
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:44,719
adrenals to go into fight or flight

2060
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,000
and then we just kill our adrenals over

2061
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,000
time as the years go on

2062
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000

2063
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,159
