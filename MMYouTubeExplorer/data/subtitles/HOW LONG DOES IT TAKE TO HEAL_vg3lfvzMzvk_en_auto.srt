1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
and that's important because a lot of

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
people they don't know

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,760
like the ebbs and flows of healing it's

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,759
three steps up two steps down

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,559
five steps up

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,520
one step down

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,520
seven steps up five steps back

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,359
nine steps up one step back

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,920
and now you're driving your car oh my

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,599
god i'm feeling kind of energetic i'm

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,880
driving my car i'm not having panic

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,840
attacks anymore my fatigue is leaving me

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
now i'm not feeling as dizzy

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
so i'm actually doing a little better

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,879
i'm not getting the heart racing today

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
it's a little better and then it's like

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,760
nine steps up

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
another step up

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,520
two steps back and what happens is as

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
you're healing

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,559
you over exert yourself so if you're

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,480
somebody

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,399
who is just on mattress island and you

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
were stuck on mattress island and you

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
were stuck there

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,399
for a while where you're like 20 hours a

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
day in bed 15 hours a day in bed couch

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,400
island 10 hours a day on couch island

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
right

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,520
and now you're starting to get better

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,439
because you're doing all this great

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,159
stuff you're taking the the right kind

33
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,640
of b12 you're taking the right kind of

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,119
licorice you're doing your lemon balm

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,119
tea you're doing some celery juice

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,439
you're doing some other things you're

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,439
reading some details on how to heal and

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,960
learning and you're getting rid of a

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,119
couple of foods that were causing

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
trouble and then you start going up and

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,840
then you start going up okay you guys

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
right

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
and as you're going up

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
you're gonna

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
do more than you have in a long time

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
you're actually

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
going to do more

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,479
and when you do more and that could be

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
just that you're in the kitchen so now

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,280

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
you're 10 minutes more in the kitchen

55
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
sink and then you're doing some other

56
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,000
things too

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,920

20-minute walk

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,840

they've taken the b12 each day each day

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,039
and all of a sudden

152
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
they're not hurting so bad and they're

153
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,919
day and they're like oh my god this is

157
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,680
amazing and then 10 days later they're

158
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,919
getting more energy and then they push

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,360
it too far and now they're often hurting

160
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,800
again for a little bit and they're like

161
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
what do i do what's going on i

162
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,160
understand i said you do three steps up

163
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,880
two steps back three steps up two steps

164
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
back the healing process it's three

165
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,199
steps up and then five steps up and then

166
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,960
nine steps up two steps back and then

167
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,199
you're further than where you were

168
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,280
before

169
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,120
further than where you were before when

170
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,960
you're doing the right things and you

171
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,240
know about the details to heal and

172
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
you're bringing in your cellular juice

173
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,759
in your heavy metal detox smoothie

174
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,080
you're taking the right kind of b12 and

175
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,840
you're doing these things a little bit

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
at a time whether you're an animal

177
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
protein person or a plant-based protein

178
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
person but you're doing a little bit of

179
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,840
time and you're bringing it in

180
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,759
and then you can you start to recover

181
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,400
and you start getting stronger it comes

182
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,080
to a point where eventually

183
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,960
you're living your life again

184
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,120
and

185
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,960
you're really pushing now the envelope

186
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,919

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,479
the next day or two you're just you're

195
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
zonked you ran on the treadmill and now

196
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,160
you're zonked

197
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
because you're doing the three steps up

198
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
two steps back there's so many different

199
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,639
scenarios it could be the most serious

200
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,720
scenario where someone's been bedridden

201
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,639
for a long time they had every diagnosis

202
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
from neurological lyme to ms or anything

203
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
else and they can't take a shower

204
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
because when they get into the shower

205
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,280
the water hits them on the back of the

206
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,560
head

207
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,720
the water hits them on the back of the

208
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,280
head and they almost get knocked over by

209
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,440
it and after the shower they have to go

210
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,440
and just try to get like their robe on

211
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,360
and lay in bed and they're in bed and

212
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
they're literally shaking not because

213
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,080
they're cold but they're shaking in bed

214
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,880
because it was a lot for them even on

215
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
that scale they're still three steps up

216
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,199
two steps back and now you're taking a

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,720
shower now you're able to wash your hair

218
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
now you're able to do things like this

219
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,479
and it's like you get it's just up and

220
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,160
then you get kicked back a little it

221
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,440
could be on that

222
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
that kind of serious scenario

223
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,800
to

224
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
you're strong and you're exercising but

225
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
you're not at the top of the game

226
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,240
because you're rehabbing and getting

227
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,080
stronger and stronger right it's in in

228
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680

getting better

251
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,000
on your rehab you still need to rehab a

252
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,919
little bit

the heavy metal detox cleanse and you're

259
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
taking some of the supplements in here

260
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,120
too so you're taking some of the

261
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,760
supplements right

262
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,839
knowing the cause and the protocol so

263
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,080
now you're learning and you're like whoa

264
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,040
i can take a little bit of licorice root

265
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,120
anthony says inside here you can start

266
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,240
really slow because it's not one size

267
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,720
fits all it's customizable and you can

268
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,440
do a little bit of licorice a little bit

269
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
of b12 and then you start to move

270
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
forward

271
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,279
and as you're moving forward you're

272
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,360
getting stronger and you're gonna use

273
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,120
that energy you're gonna use it and

274
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
you're gonna use it

275
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
hard

276
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,720

277
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,040

281
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
to me throughout since i was a child and

282
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,720
their healing process is same like even

283
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
sports people now like olympic athletes

284
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,839

293
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
up and you're going to kick back a

294
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
little bit and then you get a lit it's a

295
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,480
rehab process and a chronic illness if

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,800
there's something similar to that

297
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,959
and how long it takes for somebody to

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,320
heal

299
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,800

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,440
depends

304
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,680

you had a lot of dental work done and

318
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,839

too so how many

329
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,839
combinations of toxic heavy metals are

330
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,240
inside your brain

331
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
are is your epstein bar stronger than

332
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,279
someone else's epstein-barr you know

333
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
what happens in the medical medium

334
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,600
community

335
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,480
people come to the community

336
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,079
years ago or whatever and they heal

337
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,640
they heal

338
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,760
they go on their merry way

339
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,320
and then they get themselves sick again

340
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,560
they either contract another

341
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,079
new epstein bar

342
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,079
they contract a new

343
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,720
bacteria streptococcus maybe from a new

344
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,120
relationship because that's life that's

medical medium information then it's

351
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,519
time to do it again and to get rid of

352
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,519
these bugs a lot of people

353
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
timely fashion of the healing process

372
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,200
also depends on

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,800
what

374
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,120
traps have been set that are taken

375
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,839

376
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,240

this is a big one

409
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,959
this one's critical just so you know

410
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,959
right and

411
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,959
this charcoal right here

412
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
i got this whole thing's filled with

413
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,920
charcoal i've been

414
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,440
drinking charcoal and you know i'm

415
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,760
kidding

416
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
prime example right there

417
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,959
somebody

418
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
wanting to get better and then them

419
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,720
they're taking something like charcoal

420
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
activated charcoal and they're

421
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
swallowing it

422
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,639
it's that kind of thing that could set

423
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
people back terribly who are struggling

424
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,079
and trying to move forward this is lemon

425
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,000
balm tea

426
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,959
there's lots of traps like that out

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,839
there so healing depends on how many

428
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,920
traps were set did you do all the coffee

429
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,240
enemas that could set you back in

430
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
healing for years

431
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,000
if you're not doing the right stuff

432
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,000
did you do the sodium bicarbonate game

433
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,880
it can set you back for years

434
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,959
guzzling all that sodium bicarbonate

435
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,560
in your intestinal tract

436
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,839
nightmare

437
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,040
did you do the apple cider vinegar

438
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,440
game could totally trash your stomach

439
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,120
that's just a start right

440
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,399
did you do the diatomaceous earth

441
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,040
particles did you do the chlorella

442
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560
did you do the pearl powder

443
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,880
this pearl powder will ruin your

444
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
intestinal tract the problem is with the

445
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,639
pearl powder

446
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,120
is unfortunately there's going to be a

447
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,639
whole bunch of young adults

448
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
that are going to be hurting really bad

449
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,399
down the road in their stomachs and

450
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,720
intestinal tracts from getting sucked

451
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,880
into the pearl powder game right

452
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,199
did you do the alkaline ionizer water

453
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,519
machines with all the medical met the

454
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,639
metal particles that break free off of

455
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759
the

456
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,680
right the metal plates all these things

457
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
they add up so here you are you're

458
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
trying to heal

459
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,600
and it depends on what the person has

460
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,000
done so it may take time to heal or at

461
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,120
least learn how to stop these things the

462
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,040
scale tips so someone's like well i'm

463
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,880
trying to get better and i'm working on

464
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
it why is it taking so long and you go

465
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
through their stuff they got natural

466
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,480
flavors msg and everything they got all

467
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,839
this other stuff going on

468
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
that i'm talking about so the traps are

469
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,839
laid

470
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,240
the bait and switches are laid

471
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
they're all sitting there so someone

472
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,000
who's chronically ill is just gonna walk

473
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,680
along and that's what they're gonna do

474
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,800
and they're gonna walk around because

475
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,240
they're stuck in the woods

476
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,920
when you're chronically sick you don't

477
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,440
have answers and you've been to doctor

478
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,279
the doctor and now you're trying every

479
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,040
trendy trap you're in the woods you're

480
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,700
walking in the woods and then you step

481
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,680
oh my god

482
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,720
[Music]

483
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,000
you step on a bear trap and you now got

484
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,240
a cage

485
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,279
going like this on your ankle

486
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,199
and you can see the light on the outside

487
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,880
of the woods but you can't get to the

488
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,000
other side of the woods you can't get

489
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
there

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,839
because the the bear trap

491
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,799
is crushing your leg and keeping you in

492
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,559
the woods for another two years

493
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,000
another three years another four years

494
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,319
right

495
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
so the bear traps are laid out there

496
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,039
some are harmless like chlorophyll drops

497
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
which won't get you better but it won't

498
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,400
hurt you that bad unless it's an alcohol

499
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,400
or some other garbage and then it can

500
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
hurt you but so just takes me to the

501
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
next level here fear-mongering let's go

502
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,640
into that right now

503
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,000
so every now and then i'll see a comment

504
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,360
from a hater or a naysayer right or

505
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,799
somebody from the medical medium hate

506
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,880
groups because there's a ton of them out

507
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,840
there they just love to hate on somebody

508
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,000
and

509
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,000
the kick kick me sign on my back really

510
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,919
you know is a great place to just you

511
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,720
know kick

512
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,039
but what people don't realize is that

513
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
it's not about fear-mongering

514
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,760
because i'll see somebody say that one

515
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
time

516
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,559
it's about saving lives if you're not

517
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,039
sick

518
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,440
you can play in that game for a while

519
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,039
until you get really sick so you can do

520
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
the chlorella

521
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,960
and the fulvic acid and the shilajit

522
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,320
doctor friend of mine calls it shallot

523
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,720
and you can do

524
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,720
all of these things and don't realize

525
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,039
though right

526
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,400
don't realize because you're not so sick

527
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:33,919
you don't realize that the coffee enemas

528
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,880
and the chocolate cacao 90 bars and 74

529
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,400
bars and cacao powder in your smoothies

530
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
you don't realize in the apple cider

531
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,440
vinegar and the diatomaceous earth

532
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,200
particles right

533
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,679
and then you don't realize the pearl

534
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,480
powder and

535
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,760
right and dousing mct oil you don't

536
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,160
realize that this is hurting more than

537
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,160
helping because you're not that sick yet

538
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,760
so the scale isn't really tipping you

539
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,400
can't tell what the coffee animals are

540
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
doing quite yet

541
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,039
so

542
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
those people might be like well fear

543
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
mongering i do my coffee enemas and i'm

544
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,080
fine yeah

545
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,440
when someone's on mattress island

546
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,600
they're really sick and they got real

547
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,000
fatigue real problems serious brain fog

548
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,520
they do coffee enema and they're trashed

549
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,480
trashed so i don't call it

550
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,000
fear-mongering i call it saving lives i

551
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,600
call it critical information it's just

552
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,840
that people who aren't sick enough yet

553
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,760
or aren't sick at

554
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,120
all they're just

555
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,520
ignorant to the information right

556
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,320

incredible

563
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,120
so

564
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,520
you know you want to know if you're

565
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:54,000
going to fall into a tiger snare

566
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
and there's jagged

567
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,240
wooden sticks that have been carved to a

568
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
point down at the bottom of the hole and

569
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
you want to know if you're going to go

570
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,120
down in that you call that fear monitor

571
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,159
i call it like dude i just i'm trying to

572
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,360
stop you from messing yourself up really

573
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,120
bad

574
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
so you have a shot to heal

575
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,640
so you have a shot to heal

576
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,039
if you're really sick you feel that

577
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,799
scale tip really quick

578
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,480
that coffee enema is one last coffee

579
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,559
enema before you're really screwed up

580
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,600
same thing with air fresheners

581
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,280
people will be like oh he's

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
fear-mongering about air fresheners

583
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,039
they're wondering about it

584
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
critical to make sure you pull those air

585
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,679
fresheners out of those walls and you

586
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,679
throw them out that's critical that you

587
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
take those and you throw those babies

588
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,320
out

589
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
because those air fresheners are

590
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,159
poisoning you and they will drop your

591
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,280
immune system down and they will fill

592
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,840
you with toxic heavy metals and

593
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,159
it's about protection

594
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,480
because guess what prime example if

595
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,480
someone says oh classic aw fear

596
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,240
mongering

597
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,600
how about this you don't know what it's

598
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,880
like to be sick you don't know what it's

599
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
like to be kicked down you don't know

600
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
what it's like to be really sick going

601
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,280
to too many specialists you don't know

602
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,799
what it's like to spend

603
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,120
tens of thousands and thousands of

604
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,799
dollars on all kinds of tests you don't

605
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
know when it's real what it's like to

606
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,960
get blood tests after a blood test after

607
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,919
blood test after blood test after blood

608
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
test

609
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,400
and then

610
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,799
over and over again oh sorry the blood

611
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,799
work was another 1200 oh sorry blood

612
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,799
work was another 700 oh you got your

613
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,799
copay you got your health insurance

614
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,960
what people don't realize is there's

615
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,640
this tipping scale

616
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,919
so healing

617
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,320
isn't just doing things right it's

618
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,080
making sure you don't do some of these

619
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,039
things wrong i've always said to

620
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,440
alkaline ionizer water machines

621
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,600
will make you mental it will take you

622
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,760
down a terrible path and it does to

623
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,880
people they don't know for a while and

624
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,120
then those metals get to the brain

625
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,039
because the metal plates

626
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,480
no one realizes it but the metal plates

627
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,080
are corroding and that's highly

628
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,000
corrosive material

629
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,039
and then they end up where they can't

630
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,120
even talk their tongues won't even work

631
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,280
things go wrong with them

632
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,960
and their tongue won't even work

633
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,480
and they get these crazy neurological

634
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
symptoms in vegas their problems and

635
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,080
they go downhill and they never knew

636
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,480
because no one ever said no one ever

637
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,400
said stay away from the alkaline ionizer

638
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,919
water machines where no one ever said

639
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,200
stay away from the charcoal powder

640
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,360
because that stuff will make you so

641
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,440
deficient you're you'll fall apart down

642
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,919
the road but it's not about fear because

643
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,679
you can correct what the damage was but

644
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,360
you got to know how to correct it you

645
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,640
got to get the metals out you got to get

646
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,120
the toxins out you got to know how to

647
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280

658
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,960
lot going on you guys trying to live

659
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
your lives you guys are doing all kinds

660
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,720
of things and the fact that you're here

661
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,240
and hanging out with all of us right now

662
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,679
and with me right now is an honor i just

663
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,000
want to say that i never say that enough

664
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,120
by the way i never say that enough

665
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
so

666
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,440
it's about making sure we can kind of

667
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,120
protect each other

668
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,720
and i think that's why the medical

669
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,760
medium community

670
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,840
gets picked on so much too

671
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,520
because you guys are the salt of the

672
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,440
earth

673
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,799
the better you are

674
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,880
as a person and as a soul the more crap

675
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,480
you get the more crap you get

676
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,120
because

677
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,679
the bullies out there they want you to

678
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:50,240
be in their bully pack right

679
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320

lemon balm is

728
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,720
a very very healing herb

729
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,799
right

730
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,240
so let's go into the healing process

731
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,640
it's not just about doing things right

732
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,799
it's about looking out for what we could

733
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,279
be doing wrong

734
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,240
no one's to blame meaning you're not to

735
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,720
blame

736
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,240
if you've been pulled into a coffee

737
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
enema

738
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600

powder

740
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480

741
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,159
nervous system

most people who have been through the

751

healing process they tried all that

752
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,520
they've been sucked into each one and

753
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,279
then they're sucked into the next one

754
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,840

780
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
the stuff cakes on the inside of the

linings and it does damage the ins

782
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,159
inside the linings the testing track

783
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,399

on there too so let's talk about this

811
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,840
let's talk about blood draw just for a

812
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,840
couple of minutes

813
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,520
okay

814
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,039
all right so blood draw i want people to

815
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,640
get their blood test if they want to get

816
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,960
their blood test

817
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,240
i like blood tests for people never was

818
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,679
against it

819
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,200
what happens is people get too much

820
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,200
blood drawn

821
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,520
this can make or break somebody's

822
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,279
healing process big time

823
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,240
getting too many vials of blood taken at

824
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,679
once

825
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,080
that is a big problem right there okay

826
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,720
so and what happens is people don't

827
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,720
realize it

828
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,960
and these are the small vials people get

829
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,000
the big tubes people are getting the big

830
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,399
tubes

831
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,039
right the doctor will will send some

832
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,880
blood to the lab or the phlebotomist

833
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,559
will you know will grab some blood from

834
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,279
you right

835
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,720
and it's like okay how many do we have

836
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,880
right here right

837
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:21,279
these are small ones these are like baby

838
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:24,159
tubes right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12.

839
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,840
12 vials of blood right there okay the

840
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,080
small tubes and they don't take these

841
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,880
small tubes really

842
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,840
so what people don't realize is that's

843
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
one

844
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,120
of the ways we can't heal

845
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,200
if we're doing the right stuff

846
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,480
it gets countered

847
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,000
by doing the wrong stuff

848
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,399
blood tests are good

849
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,159
i believe in it but what happens is when

850
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,679
they keep on drawing too much blood and

851
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,279
you don't know what to do you don't know

852
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,559
how to tell the doctor can you please

853
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,760
just take two

854
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,520
vials

855
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,240
and then i'll come back another time and

856
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,120
you could take another two

857
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
but take two or three vials max at a

858
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,440
time

859
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,679
but they'll take no we'll take five

860
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,080
vials seven files 20 miles 30 vials

861
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,520
right and they're removing your your

862
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,279
immune cells

863
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,039
out of your bloodstream is what happens

864
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,600
so your immune cells are being sucked up

865
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,520
and tossed out

866
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,120
and that's what happens

867
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,679
then

868
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,240
the reason why you're at the doctors

869
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,320
with all your pain and suffering and

870
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
your diagnosis and your autoimmune

871
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,440
diagnosis and everything else

872
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,440
because of pathogens

873
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,960
your immune system is trying to protect

874
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,159
you from the pathogens

875
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,240
so it's keeping the pathogens down

876
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,080
you're still sick because you've got the

877
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,760
pathogens and you're still sick because

878
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,720
your immune system is weak

879
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,039
but then

880
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,960
we get all these

881
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,519
orally says i only allow three to five

882
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,120
vials at a time brilliant

883
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,360
brilliant

884
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,600
i tell my friends and family only allow

885
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,440
two to three vials at a time

886
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,080
or

887
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,600
three to five half vials that's what i

888
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,039
tell my friends and family to do but you

889
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
do whatever you know you want to do and

890
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,120
your doctor wants to

891
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,880
so you end up drawing out

892
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,559
from all the blood work

893
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,919
the very thing that protects you from

894
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,799
why you're sick

895
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
and then

896
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,200
you get sicker a month later could get

897
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,320
sicker a week later two months later but

898
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,760
then you've got to go to the doctor

899
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,279
again

900
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,880
and then he sends you to a specialist

901
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,279
and now he's taking this plus way more

902
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,279
and then the doctor's just gambling away

903
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,120
your blood right here

904
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,320
okay i think i got a deck of cards

905
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,760
sitting over there i think i'm gonna

906
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,760
grab in a second

907
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,200
on the table and

908
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
because i think we're gonna

909
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,000
you know we'll do a little gambling real

910
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,080
quick

911
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,679
we'll do a little i don't know we'll get

912
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,640
some cards out

913
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,000
we'll have some fun okay

914
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,440
because

915
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,519
this is how it works and these cards are

916
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,679
the cool cards because these are the

917
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,440
wyman's wild blueberry cards

918
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,919
you guys this is really cool

919
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,600
a stack of wyman's wild blueberry cars

920
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679

921
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,440

923
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,840
right here right

924
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,320
so what happens is

925
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,880
everybody starts to gamble your blood

926
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,559
away well

927
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
i think we're going to do a couple of

928
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,519
tests we don't really know what's wrong

929
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,360
with you

930
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,039
we don't know really why you're sick we

931
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,039
just think you got autoimmune

932
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,320
i'm gonna bet four vials of your blood

933
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,679
away here see we got here let's get some

934
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,919
right

935
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,960
what huh

936
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,440
oh

937
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,640
okay do some do some wait what lost i

938
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,279
lost you can tell i don't know how to

939
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,960
play cards

940
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,559
but

941
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,960
okay see you later

942
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,519
lost those four vials come back in a

943
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
couple of weeks i think i'm gonna gamble

944
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,440
let's do

945
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,159
do five vials this time right let's see

946
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
what we got here

947
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,120
that's funny that queen has a b on there

948
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,519
yeah and that jack has a lumberjack on

949
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,760
there

950
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,760
anyway

951
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,000
these are great cards

952
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,960
the bottom line is we're gambling with

953
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,840
our lives and the doctors right

954
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,960
mistakenly in the blood labs gambling

955
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,039
your blood away

956
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,399
for inconclusive tests mostly now i

957
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,760
believe in blood working you should get

958
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,240
blood work but you got to be careful

959
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,919
because they throw the blood away

960
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,600
and then we go backwards and we go

961
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,880
backwards right

962
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,519
i talk about this the medical media

963
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,320
podcast at apple podcast all the details

964
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,880
but the bottom line is i'm noticing

965
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,440
that people forget

966
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,200
they forget about the blood work thing

967
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,799
or they never learned it yet the medical

968
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,799
meme information

969
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,480
so they come into the community someone

970
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,320
doesn't remind them about their blood

971
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,159
work

972
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,720
and they just got 20 vials pulled

973
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,040
and now they're online and they're like

974
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,879
i don't feel good today i'm gonna just

975
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,040
try something else this celery juice

976
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,359
made me sick

977
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,000
not the 20 vials that was taken from a

978
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,359
specialist eight days ago

979
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,119
because people don't realize it so their

980
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,359
immune system is being drawn out of them

981
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,200
and that's the whole thing lorena says i

982
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,720
like cards but i don't gamble either do

983
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,320
i

984
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,000

i'll let you guys

994
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,879

anyway you guys

997
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,200
quick run out real quick recap right

998
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,119
there it's not only doing the right

999
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,079
things get the right b12 instead of the

1000
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,000
b12 that has something bad in it you

1001
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,079
know high quality it's not just doing

1002
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,720
like one b12 it's about methylcobalamin

1003
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,240
dinosaur balance it's about

1004
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,280
spirulina not chlorella it's about

1005
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,839
right

1006
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,000
it's about licorice fruit not a coffee

1007
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,400
enema with whatever there's so many

1008
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
different aspects it's about

1009
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,240
right

1010
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,040
vegan epa dha oil

1011
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,839
not

1012
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,240
fish oil these things add up right and

1013
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,040
they add up it's about not doing the

1014
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,119
wrong type of magnesium right

1015
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,359
and then it's about doing

1016
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,119
celery juice and other things and other

1017
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,520
tools and getting metals out that we all

1018
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,880

1019
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,720

1020
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,560
