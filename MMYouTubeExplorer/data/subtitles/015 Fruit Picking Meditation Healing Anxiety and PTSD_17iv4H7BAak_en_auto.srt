time to take a stroll in a field or walk

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,080

picking

272
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,039
meditation your journey in life has now

273
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,520
been reinforced you have brought the

274
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,559
power of fruit picking into your very

275
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,840
own existence

276
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,000
every cell in your body was awakened by

277
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,720
this

278
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,440
experience all fruit trees have a soul

279
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,880
but their soul can never be fulfilled

280
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,559
unless we as humans are eating the fruit

281
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,240
they bear in order for us to feel whole

282
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,799
we have to have an unbroken Spirit heart

283
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:56,600
and soul fruit picking mends the cracks

284
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:00,440
of all three and lets us find our way

285
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,679
not be lost and live our life free the

286
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:07,200
very wounds we have come to know push us

287
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,840
up just like a fruit tree grows and over

288
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,559
time all that we've been through the

289
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,400
storms the weather the wind over the

290
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,960
ocean of Life allowed the beauty to show

291
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,480
your path will never be the same now

292
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,640
that you have experienced fruit picking

293
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,440
which will begin to reverse PTSD anxiety

294
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,559
broken trust and anything that's stands

295
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:35,360

when you reach up to pick up a divine

298
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,880
piece of fruit a message runs through

299
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,559
you connecting you from the fruit to the

300
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:51,400
ground your soul begins to spark as you

301
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:54,240

302
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,100
