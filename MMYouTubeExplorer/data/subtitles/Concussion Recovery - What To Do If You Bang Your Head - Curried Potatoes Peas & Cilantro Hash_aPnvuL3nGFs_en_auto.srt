that's right we're doing that today why

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,280

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,079
walking into walls bumping their heads

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,600

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,640
what are we talking about headbanging

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,000
we're talking about concussions too like

38
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,720
what about the concussion you get into a

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,880
car accident and then you are struggling

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,520
and suffering with like chronic illness

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,799
diagnosed with lime and then you're

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,600
diagnosed with that and then you're

47
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,680
diagn it's just crazy how it works and

48
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,079
then there's so much more to it than

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,799
just this as well there's a lot more but

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,399
so many people

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
struggle and they struggle what H they

52
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,039
struggle when they go through some kind

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,039
of Crisis what about sports injuries

54
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:00,280

lingering and lingering there's a lot of

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,520
people who have struggled so many times

59
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,399
and then we're going to talk about like

60
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920

people do and they do it all the time

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,800
another thing we're talking about is

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
it's a wave where everybody in the

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,360

74
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,040
guts out I've been trying to tell you

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,720
the media is keeping it quiet under WPS

76
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,480

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
is going around too right so that's

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,760
going around right now already so people

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
already caught their so-called colds

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
they already caught their so-called flu

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,239
depending on what was happening maybe it

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
was C maybe it was flu maybe it was C

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,799
maybe it was flu maybe they got tested

85
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,000
and it didn't come up a c but then it

86
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,760
did later like whatever's going on the

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,080

do that someone's not going to be happy

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,840
though if they bang their head really

158
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,199
hard I can tell you

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,759
that and I'm

160
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,120
also

161
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,039
going to get Samantha's head model out

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,479
that's Samantha's head model and she

163
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,520
will be coming someday just things have

164
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,160
been crazy she said she's been so busy

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,639
talking about protein and helping people

166
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,560
about with their protein needs that she

167
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:40,080
said that she could not come yet um but

168
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,880
anyway the point is is we're going into

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,280
little bit of the head stuff why not

170
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,280
where have you banged your head right

171
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,319
was it the front really bad so we're

172
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,759
going to go into sharp objects so you

173
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
bang into something really sharp right

174
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,039
like something sharp like the corner of

175
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,599
a table versus something that's not

176
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,280
sharp and your head hits it really hard

177
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,440
and your whole head shakes so we're

178
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,080
going to go into those details too okay

179
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:11,080
so that'll be good

180
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,080
so

181
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,960
anyway let's get that up there

182
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,479
ready so I want to talk about this topic

183
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,520
because I think it's

184
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:25,800
under understood it's under understood

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
it's misunderstood it's not talked about

186
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,800
nobody really cares about it there a lot

187
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,080
of tortured people though chronically

188
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,199
suffering because they banged her head

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
lots of them out there life was never

190
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,199
the same anymore and then no one knew

191
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,759
why how come it happened and what's

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,240
going on and they went and got a bunch

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,400
of MRIs and a whole bunch of different

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,680
CAT scans and they're taking you know

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,639
getting scans of their brain and they're

196
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,879
looking for that hollowed out section in

197
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,759
the middle of the brain is what they're

198
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,639
looking for maybe you have that disease

199
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,560
where you're missing the middle of your

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,080
brain and it's starting to hollow out

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,039
and people are looking for that they're

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,599
looking for a gap in their brain because

203
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,280
so when people have headaches and

204
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,879
problems and injuries the doctor might

205
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,159
say well you know you had those old

206
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,919
sports injuries you had all those

207
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,000
problems you had that car accident so

208
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,039
maybe you've got that missing piece of

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,879
brain that develops right where it

210
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,400
atrophies is in the center of the brain

211
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,599
and so forth right above the brain stem

212
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,840
so um but let's go into it some Basics

213
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:28,520
first besides like heavy concussions

214
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,599
injuries and so forth let's go into

215
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,200
Basics right you bend your head on

216
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,519
something sharp something that has a

217
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,000
point to it right so something that's

218
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,080
Jagged hits your head okay and it hurts

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,600
maybe a piece of metal sticking out of

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
some porch on your house and you're not

221
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,519
you you're in the area and you just

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,279
banged your head on it maybe you banged

223
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,680
your head on something else but either

224
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,839
way the injury happens and it's the

225
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
frontal lobe area right you bang your

226
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
head here it's a sharp

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,279
object

228
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,560
okay first thing that happens here is

229
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:10,480
you don't have to bend your head that

230
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,600
hard to get this type of injury but when

231
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,560
you get this type of injury it's a

232
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,880
pinpoint injury it's where it's a direct

233
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,880
pinpoint now I don't like those you can

234
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,720
get a you can get a hematoma from those

235
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,279
you can get problems with those but what

236
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,279
happens here is if you don't ice this

237
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,640
fast if you don't get the ice out quick

238
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,399
right this can be become a problem this

239
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,959
can turn into a storm for so many

240
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,240
different people so you have to know

241
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,519
what to do when you do when you actually

242
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,640
bang your head and it's a sharp object

243
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,560
so with this kind of bump on your head

244
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,200
you'll get an egg that egg will start to

245
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,240
occur that's the body's defense

246
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,480
mechanism right there where the body's

247
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,440
like the body's actually reacting that's

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,160
the reaction that's reaction you get to

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,440
actually protect your brain so the egg

250
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,920
the bump on the SK skull that starts to

251
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:07,279
occur is a mechanism to protect your

252
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,360
brain that's what that's for it's like a

253
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,720
sealant it's trying to seal the

254
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,120
potential fracture or hole in your skull

255
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,560
but that doesn't happen with 99% or 98%

256
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,040
or whatever 90% of people just banging

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,760
their head they're not going to get a

258
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,600
fracture in that moment they're not

259
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,839
going to get a hole in their skull but

260
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,880
there's this defense mechanism our body

261
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,079
has

262
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,000
where it it this inflammation occurs

263
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,079
instantly around the bone around the

264
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,160
skull and right right inside so then you

265
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,399
get this egg that egg is to

266
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,839
seal it's to

267
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,000
seal any kind of imped Ms anything

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,079
that's been opened any kind of access or

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,320
open ways right but yeah even though you

270
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,880
get an egg when nothing happened

271
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,720
terribly and you get that sharp egg on

272
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,399
your head when nothing went terribly

273
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,680
wrong your body still gets that egg it

274
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,920
still gets that crazy

275
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,839
inflammatory development where boom it

276
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,279
rises really quick and it starts to

277
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,399
pound and then you feel it it's sharp as

278
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,279
heck and you feel that pain radiating

279
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,519
around it right but it's sharp and it

280
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,959
was a small hit so something like you

281
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,200
know something sticking out of a wall or

282
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,680
something and you walk by and you Peg

283
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,880
yourself and you're like wow that really

284
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,600
hurt and then you're kind of like oh my

285
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,600
God and you're feeling that little spot

286
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,399
it's critical to get ice on that spot

287
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,839
quick so you don't want to be like well

288
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,560
you know what I'll deal with this later

289
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,360
I'll just rub it for a second and I'll

290
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,160
deal with this later you want to deal

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,440
with it in the moment you want to get

292
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,279
cold compress you want to get some ice

293
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,120
in a bag you want something like that

294
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,760
and you want to press it on the spot but

295
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,600
keep in mind there this is really

296
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
important to know I mean maybe you don't

297
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,959
care about this information but I think

298
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,959
it's really important you don't want to

299
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:12,800
ice your whole head around the spot when

300
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,320
it's like a pinpoint hit where you hook

301
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,560
it into something sharp something

302
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,800
meaning something pointy the corner of a

303
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,600
counter okay maybe the hood of your car

304
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,880
like some pointy thing sticking out of

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,880
the hood of your car whatever it is you

306
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,839
don't want to just ice the entire area

307
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,720
you want to pinpoint that ice on the

308
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,760
spot that's what you want to do and

309
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,360
that's very important so here's the next

310
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,040
part too if you hit your head here on

311
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,560
this side say your right side on that

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,240
spot there you want to ice the front

313
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,959
right here okay and you want to pinpoint

314
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,920
the ice right on top of it and you want

315
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,800
to do that for whatever 5 10 minutes you

316
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,519
can back off the ice you can put it back

317
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
on you can back off the ice you can put

318
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,600
it back back on by the way call your

319
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,320
doctor go to the hospital whatever

320
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,639
anybody needs of course but I'm just

321
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,399
saying that this is stuff I would do if

322
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,800
I happen to me or my family and so forth

323
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,240
but you you put the ice on the spot you

324
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,480
back the ice off you put it back on it's

325
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,000
going to hurt you back it off you do

326
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,199
this put it on for another minute or two

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,959
3 four minutes right directly on here it

328
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,839
could be a cloth wrapped around the ice

329
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,480
could be just a cloth and then you back

330
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,279
it off okay what you're doing here is

331
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,279
you're applying cold super cold for

332
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,560
moments and then backing off the cold

333
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,680
for for a moment when you back off the

334
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,320
cold you give your body a chance to

335
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,199
recalibrate and heal so you give this

336
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,480
area a chance to actually heal faster

337
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,720
then you put the ice back on and you

338
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,639
give it a few minutes and if you can't

339
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,079
stand it anymore and it hurts you back

340
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,360
the ice off right and you do this where

341
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,079
you you on and off you take the ice off

342
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,279
you put the ice on that little

343
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:05,560
pinpointed egg that egg spot what

344
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,399
happens is it's this intermittent icing

345
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,920
that allows the body to respond

346
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:13,240
different differently it takes the body

347
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,839
out of crisis mode and puts it more into

348
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,639
healing mode so that's important to know

349
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,000
so say you get a bigger bump you bump

350
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,079
the front of your head and it's a bigger

351
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,639
bump okay so I'm going to do a little

352
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,120
bit of a bigger bump if you guys don't

353
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,600
mind I hope this is interesting I find

354
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,720
it quite

355
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,839
interesting um

356
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,480
okay so what you have right there sure I

357
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,920
got that ink on my cutting board so I

358
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,920
can eat it later so what you have right

359
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
here is a larger bump it's not so much

360
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,680
as a pinpoint it's a little bigger of a

361
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,800
bump it's a little bigger of a hit the

362
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,079
egg is bigger the egg is

363
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,959
bigger this kind of bump you want to do

364
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,480
similar you want to get ice onto it

365
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,199
immediately you don't want to let this

366
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,079
sit you don't want the inflammation

367
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,079
to get out of control you don't want it

368
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,639
just taking over you want to get that

369
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,920
cold compress on here quick very

370
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,759
important to know get the cold compress

371
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,959
on there quick and when it's a bigger

372
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,240
bump and it's a bigger egg okay you do

373
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,199
the same thing you hold the compress on

374
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,240
there you back off after a few minutes

375
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,120
or even five minutes if it if it feels

376
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,920
good enough right you can do this thing

377
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,639
where you're intermittent you're on

378
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,480
you're off you're on you're off but the

379
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,440
difference is with this bump here being

380
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,759
that it's a larger egg and you feel it's

381
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,120
a larger egg and it feels like you're

382
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,319
feeling pain in other areas you want to

383
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,560
put an ice pack you want to take your

384
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:45,440
ice pack off of that bump and then you

385
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,880
want to put the ice pack on the back of

386
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,480
your head you want to put it on the back

387
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,720
of your head where that side of the bump

388
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,160
is so here's the bump right here okay

389
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,680
that's your bigger bump right there all

390
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,839
right now you want to put the ice pad

391
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,560
back on the back of the head just like

392
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,639
this you see this there's the bump right

393
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,639
here it's a good size egg it's larger

394
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,440
than this little pinpoint

395
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,079
bump and then but you want to get the

396
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,759
cold pack on the back of the head you

397
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,079
want to do that for a couple of minutes

398
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,800
that's not where the bump is no it's not

399
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:30,000
what this does is this actually slows

400
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:33,519
down the body's mechanism of Crisis

401
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,360
State because you got a bigger egg

402
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,360
bigger bump it's a bigger problem and so

403
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,639
you want to get cold compress on the

404
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,680
back of your

405
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,079
head instead for a moment and then when

406
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,120
you do that for a couple of minutes you

407
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,680
switch back up and you get the bump

408
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,959
right here what this does is it calms

409
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,079
the body

410
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:58,519
down so that you don't have a storm

411
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:02,040
going on because when we bang our head

412
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:06,160
heads weird stuff happens blood vessels

413
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,079
start to pop and break we get

414
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,120
bleeders we get

415
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,720
hematomas we get blood clots we get

416
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,959
blood pooling so blood pulling where it

417
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,319
pulls in

418
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,280
Eddies okay different things happen when

419
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,400
we bang our head and so what you're

420
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:31,880
doing is this bigger hit right here

421
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:36,280
means most likely your head moved your

422
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:39,520
brain moved apologize your brain moved

423
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:41,039
this one here this pinpoint one sharp

424
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,280
object I mean not razor sharp where

425
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,679
you'd be bleeding everywhere and you

426
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,760
need stitches you got to go to the

427
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,600
hospital and get stitched up right but

428
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,760
this sharp one right here this pinpoint

429
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,440
one where oh it's an egg and it hurts

430
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,159
and you feel it chances are that your

431
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,760
brain didn't

432
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:01,240
SLO you didn't have any slashing effects

433
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,919
with your brain I'm going to go into

434
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,240
that in a little bit too okay this one

435
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:12,360
here is a bigger egg you bend your head

436
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,880
you might have even seen a star R2 or

437
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,000
some type of maybe like some weird

438
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,960
squiggly things going across when you

439
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,799
hit maybe you you saw something when you

440
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,400
hit maybe you just saw black when you

441
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,880
hit but either way this bigger bump

442
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,559
right here you want to ice the front

443
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,400
with the C pack you know comfortably

444
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,159
comfortably I mean if it's killing you

445
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,280
or it's too cold you know back off and

446
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:42,080
you can go back and forth but with this

447
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,480
one you want to get the cold compress on

448
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,400
the other side after a few minutes so

449
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,039
here you are you're applying your ice

450
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,440
pack right here you're putting it on the

451
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,159
spot and then after a few minutes or 3

452
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,320
to five minutes you flip

453
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:59,120
it and you put it in the same

454
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,240
hemisphere

455
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,280
same hemisphere but on the

456
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,520
back that's what you do you don't put it

457
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,840
on the other

458
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,600
Hemisphere and then the back of it you

459
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,480
put the same hemisphere as the big bump

460
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
went there's the big bump okay see the

461
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,400
midline canal right right hemisphere

462
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
left hemisphere you see the midline

463
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
midline

464
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,600
canal well what you want to do is you

465
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,600
want to make

466
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,919
sure you get the right hemisphere so on

467
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,880
this bump you got to get the cold p on

468
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:39,039
the other side what this can do is

469
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,200
literally halt

470
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,600
hematomas blood vessel

471
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,640
breakage weird blood

472
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,840
clots

473
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,840
contusions it can halt those bring those

474
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,000
down okay because your head your brain

475
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,000
moved a little bit probably on the

476
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,240
bigger bump your brain moved a little

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,799
bit and if your brain moves a little

478
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,360
bit you want to get the cold pack on the

479
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:12,760
back right there now let's do another

480
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,039
hit now you just freaking hit your head

481
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,919
now you boom you hit it you're walking

482
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:22,240
on a sidewalk you trip you got your

483
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:24,720
sandals on you stub your toe you get

484
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,679
caught on something and you go down and

485
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,640
you bang your forehead really hard on a

486
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:36,159
metal bicycle on a park bench on a

487
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,159
whatever some front door on the cement

488
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,559
on the

489
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:44,720
curb on a car you bang the crap out of

490
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:48,120
the front of your head where you just

491
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,120
boom in this

492
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:58,320
situation you may not get an egg you may

493
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,120
not get a bump you may not get this huge

494
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,799
bump or egg on your head you might get a

495
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,480
little one but the hit was much harder

496
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,120
than what the bump shows keep that in

497
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,039
mind you're a hit really hard but you

498
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,200
don't have an egg you don't have really

499
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,320
a bump but you're hit hard frontal lobe

500
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,039
you hit it boom really

501
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,799
hard so in this

502
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,600
situation obviously you know you call

503
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,880
your doctor and so forth see what your

504
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,200
doctor wants to do but in this situation

505
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,640
what I would do okay is I would get ice

506
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,919
pack right on the frontal lobe right on

507
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,880
the front and I would do a couple of

508
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:46,120
different things I would ice the front

509
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,600
of my head where it hit okay but when

510
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,919
you hit your brain slashed

511
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,200
forward so your brain went forward is

512
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,600
what it did it went that way so you went

513
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,159
like this boom

514
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,480
and your brain then went boom it's kind

515
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,039
of like an elevator the elevator's going

516
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,960
down you're on an elevator and the cord

517
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,440
was cut or the elevator broke and you're

518
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,320
going down in that elevator the elevator

519
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,960
hits and then you

520
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
go right same thing you're walking along

521
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,640
you trip

522
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,279
boom your head hits something and your

523
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,520
brain slashes

524
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:30,159
forward and when that happens you will

525
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,960
have to first and foremost you have to

526
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,240
ice the front for a little bit but now

527
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,279
you got to do the back of the head you

528
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,720
have to ice the back of the head so

529
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:40,440
that's the next thing so you got to

530
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,480
definitely ice behind Okay the back of

531
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,880
the head not just the front of the head

532
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:51,120
the reason why is because your brain

533
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,000
shook from its cage connective tissue

534
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,200
the spider web of nerves and connected

535
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
tissue between the skull and the Brain

536
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,919
okay your brain moved away from the back

537
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,240
of your

538
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,520
skull and was

539
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,440
shooken it was

540
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,919
shaken and because of that inflammation

541
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,120
is going to start occurring in the back

542
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:16,000
of the brain if you don't do the quick

543
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,080
icing on the back of the brain and you

544
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,480
only ice the front of the brain the

545
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,600
frontal lobe in that situation it's not

546
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,440
going to be enough to protect you to

547
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,880
give you a fighting chance so your

548
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,960
concussion is

549
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,679
less so your concussion is less so you

550
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,880
don't have all the after effects you're

551
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,240
not

552
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,919
suffering so you have to do a front cold

553
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,240
pack then you got to go around the back

554
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,799
leave the front alone and you got to do

555
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,919
the back yeah you didn't hit the back of

556
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,400
your head you didn't hit the back there

557
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,240
no you didn't do that see but you still

558
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,840
got to get the cold pack on the back of

559
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,240
the head because that brain of yours

560
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,240
left that

561
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,799
area and It Slam into the front of your

562
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,919
skull and the back now is going to get

563
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:06,120
in inflamed and

564
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,919
swollen kind of similar to a car

565
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,440
accident car accident you ban your head

566
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,360
on the steering wheel some people an

567
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,600
airbag can literally give them a

568
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,080
concussion not some people half the

569
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,720
people out there that get into car

570
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,760
accidents the airbag itself gives them a

571
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
concussion so it's like oh I got my

572
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,880
airbags I'll be fine I get into a car

573
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,399
accident I got my airbags and all be

574
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,200
what oh you boom

575
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,159
and that airbag just knocks you silly

576
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,919
gives most people or not most but I'd

577
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,799
say 50% of the people that get into car

578
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,080
accidents and that airbag goes off boom

579
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,240
right in their face 50% get a mild

580
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,000
concussion some get severe

581
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,120
concussions so in this situation you

582
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
bang your head in the front really hard

583
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,480
you got to get some ice on there quick

584
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,399
because you're stopping a

585
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,080
storm you're stopping a reaction a

586
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:58,559
crisis State reaction you have to slow

587
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,520
that crisis State reaction

588
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,840
down reminds me of a story a long time

589
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,399
ago where this guy was driving a

590
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:12,520
motorcycle and he had his helmet on okay

591
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:15,360
he got into a crash on the

592
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,000
highway his bike went down he was going

593
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,919
80 90 M an hour something happened

594
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,240
another car and so forth and he went

595
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:30,320
down and then he got up from the ground

596
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,840
and was walking

597
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,559
around cops got there Medics got there

598
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,480
fire department got there everybody got

599
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,120
there the ambulances got there the other

600
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,200
people were being addressed and taking

601
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,120
care of they were taking care of him

602
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,039
too and the guy was told by someone not

603
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,000
to remove his helmet not to remove his

604
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,360
helmet he had his helmet on and what was

605
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,399
happening was there was a crisis The

606
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,159
Happening inside his head inside his

607
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:07,120
brain he was walking around

608
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:10,360
fine the police department was there the

609
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,399
Medics were there right paramedics were

610
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,240
there the EMTs were there everybody was

611
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:18,480
there the state police were there and he

612
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,360
took off his helmet and he

613
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,840
died his helmet was on but he wasn't

614
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,120
getting care for a long time because

615
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,360
there was confusion because even though

616
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,200
he wiped out he was walking around fine

617
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,320
and talking perfectly fine he was like

618
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,279
yeah know I'm all right yeah that's my

619
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,600
motorcycle it's 100 yards down that way

620
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,919
I got a bad scratch on my leg but I

621
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,840
don't need a stretcher I don't need

622
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,919
anything I don't have to worry about

623
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,600
nothing I don't need to go into the

624
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,720
ambulance and they sat him down and

625
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,559
they're like okay he's talking fine they

626
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,360
did a little check on his eyes his

627
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,760
helmet was still on he did a little

628
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,880
check on his eyes right little

629
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,159
flashlight in there dilation pupils and

630
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,399
all that and it was going on too long it

631
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,679
was like 45 minutes because the accident

632
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:05,559
report was being filled out people were

633
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,399
being taken care of tow trucks were

634
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,880
coming and grabbing grabbing things but

635
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:14,919
it went so long without something to

636
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,720
slow down the crisis that the minute the

637
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,840
guy took off his helmet and one

638
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,720
paramedic was like hey wait a minute you

639
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,760
were in that accident don't take off sir

640
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,159
don't take off your helmet sir don't

641
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,559
take off your helmet stop stop right now

642
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,600
the guy took off his helmet

643
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,760
and he died right there hit the ground

644
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,080
and died everything came

645
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,279
apart because in that 45 minutes of that

646
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,519
head injury they didn't have they didn't

647
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:46,480
cold pack him they didn't ice him they

648
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:49,000
didn't ice his head and at least slow

649
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,159
that progression down of that storm

650
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,279
before they can get him to the hospital

651
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,640
get him into Imaging and see where the

652
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,640
bleeders are and see where the

653
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,600
inflammation was really compounding see

654
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,159
if the skull was

655
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:08,000
fractured but it never got to that point

656
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,519
and never got to that point so we're

657
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,559
talking about mild stuff right here

658
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,039
though in the whole bit head injuries

659
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,799
can be huge triggers let's go into head

660
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,440
injuries can be a huge trigger but

661
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,120
before I go into that I just want to say

662
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,600
so you bump your head in the front and

663
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,799
it's a pretty good bump and you know it

664
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,279
because you felt it you saw

665
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,039
Stars you want to not just put a cold

666
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
compress on the front you want to switch

667
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,600
and put on the back you want to slow

668
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
down the inflammation that occurs from

669
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,600
the brain

670
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:41,399
leaving the cockpit and moving forward

671
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,399
okay so now what happens when it's the

672
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,799
back of your head let's do that really

673
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,640
quick how many people have bang their

674
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,720
head the back of their head

675
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,720
right how many people have done

676
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,320
that you bumped your head you slipped

677
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:05,320
you fell down now it's the back of

678
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,320
that

679
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,919
okay all right that's the front again

680
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,760
what am I

681
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
doing there's nothing like

682
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,679
alive so that's the back of the head

683
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,880
here we go so now you fall and you bang

684
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,320
the back of your head head really hard

685
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,240
you see stars you almost black out most

686
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,799
guaranteed to have a mild concussion

687
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,279
coming right first thing you got to do

688
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,840
is compress cold compress again but

689
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,559
starting on the back of the head you

690
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,080
want to pinpoint not pinpoint but you

691
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,480
want to generalize it to the back of the

692
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,640
head because you won't know really where

693
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,039
you hit it when you slipped and fell and

694
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,880
the back of your head hit the ground you

695
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,480
won't really know

696
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,200
where you might have pain you might feel

697
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,960
it you might kind of know where but you

698
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,559
kind of won't know where so you put that

699
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,519
cold pack on the back of the head right

700
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,519
here you do that for what few minutes at

701
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,000
a time too cold you can back it off a

702
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,399
little bit then put it back on you can

703
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,360
back it off a little bit then put it

704
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:13,760
back on right can do that but you also

705
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,919
then want to switch it to the front now

706
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,159
yeah you didn't hit the front of your

707
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:18,640
face and you didn't hit the front of

708
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:21,279
your head but you want to get the front

709
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,240
you want to make sure you hit the ice on

710
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,440
the front give it some time few minutes

711
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,000
and so forth then flip it on the back

712
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,600
what you're doing is slowing down the

713
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,840
storm you're going to have a milder

714
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
concussion because of this this is

715
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,159
important information you're going to

716
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,840
have a milder

717
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,360
concussion because of this move right

718
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,519
here right here so you bend your head

719
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,120
really bad on the back oh you slipped

720
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,600
boom slipped on some ice boom right you

721
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,760
got the ice back here you're cold

722
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,320
compressing and then after a few minutes

723
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,600
or sometime you flip it you put it on

724
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,720
the

725
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,720
front put it on the front the only

726
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,960
difference here when it comes down to

727
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,960
hitting the back of your

728
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,960
head is you want to put ice on the back

729
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,960
and then you want to

730
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:14,519
then you want to put it on the top you

731
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,360
want to go front back top front back top

732
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,440
whatever Back front top do that few

733
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,720
minutes on the top few minutes on the

734
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,799
back but you don't want to put your

735
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,039
whole head in ice you don't want to go

736
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,240
into an ice bath you want you don't want

737
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,760
to submerge your body into an ice bath

738
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,799
if you banged your head that's not what

739
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,480
you do you don't want ice everywhere on

740
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,600
your head this is critical to know

741
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,600
because if you put it everywhere you're

742
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,760
slowing down the healing

743
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,200
process it has to be localized boom

744
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,200
right in the back where you hit it you

745
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,399
wait a few minutes or or you know four

746
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,039
five minutes or three minutes and then

747
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:53,760
it's on top 3 four minutes and then it's

748
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:56,320
in the front that's how you prevent

749
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,200
concussions that are going to spiral out

750
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,919
of control and become someone's bane of

751
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,960
their existence I heard it so many times

752
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,200
over and over and over again I heard

753
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:09,320
people you know what a w the reason why

754
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,519
I came to see you is because I had a car

755
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,799
accident 20 years ago and I'm still not

756
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,080
right something's still terribly wrong

757
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:18,519
I'm sick with all these problems my head

758
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,240
my eyes I got this I got that the whole

759
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,360
bit I know you're not lying so caramel

760
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,919
says I know you're not lying I've been

761
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,159
several car in several car accidents and

762
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:33,159
they sent me into a very deep depression

763
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,600
I was diagnosed with TMJ all kind of

764
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:37,039
weird symptoms developed you can get

765
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,240
diagnosed with TMJ from that you can get

766
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,000
diagnosed with a lot of different things

767
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,000
um so many different things fibro TMJ ra

768
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
you can just get literally diagnosed

769
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,760
with

770
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,080
everything and so that's what can happen

771
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,440
right so

772
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,120
um so I just want to tell you something

773
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,799
about you know C right

774
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,240
that's going around and stuff like that

775
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:03,760
and all that you know how there's After

776
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:06,360
Effects there's Long Haul C you know how

777
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,279
long haul SE what's a medical medium

778
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,519
thing to start with I published it first

779
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,679
talked about it first Long Haul flu

780
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,760
right so um I've done lives on it years

781
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,519
ago I've done lectures on it what

782
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,279
happens when you catch the flu and then

783
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,320
you're not the same after you catch a

784
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,240
bad flu and you're beaten down and it's

785
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,720
and you're just you're you're tired got

786
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,360
fatigued got symptoms well the same

787
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,760
thing can happen with concussion so like

788
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,120
Long Haul

789
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,720
concussion same thing happens with those

790
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,840
concussions where they last for a long

791
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,480
time they can last forever for people

792
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,200
they can last for 10 years 5 years this

793
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,799
is a serious problem when it comes down

794
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,279
to the chronically ill and so many

795
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,519
people with chronic illnesses don't

796
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,440
realize they've been triggered because

797
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:56,200
they banged their head and they don't

798
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,279
realize that they've been set back

799
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,320
because they Bang hang their head

800
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,519
they've had a car accident they've had

801
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,799
an injury with their head sosed

802
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,760
around and so they've got into these

803
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:10,440
situations but what's really more

804
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,440
annoying is that someone who's stuck

805
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,119
with some type of situation where

806
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,240
they're head was injured whether a car

807
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,839
accident or something else and then

808
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,720
they're sick for years they got the

809
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,079
symptoms like TMJ like all these other

810
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,079
different symptoms you can have like

811
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,960
neck pain migraines head pain dizziness

812
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,399
vertigo ringing in the ear tontis all

813
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,240
that's happening and then you bang your

814
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,839
head again and then you bang your head

815
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,839
again

816
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:39,599
darn you get into a little fender bender

817
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,720
and your head gets jostled you get a

818
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,000
little Whiplash and your head slams the

819
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,000
back of your seat and then you bang it

820
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,280
again that's what happens to everybody

821
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,159
they bang their head again they slip

822
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,440
they fall boom they bang their head

823
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,960
again it happens all over again so

824
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,240
that's why this is important right here

825
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,200
so anybody who's chronically ill

826
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,599
chronically sick so let's go into that a

827
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,720
little bit so in the brainsaver

828
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,920
protocols there is concussion in here in

829
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,560
the brain saver protocols let's go find

830
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,560
it here it

831
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
is

832
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:21,119
so um aha concussion recovery side

833
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,560
effects so what you'll see right here I

834
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,119
know it's hard to see I'm just showing

835
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,200
you this is in brain saver protocols

836
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,520
okay it says concussion recover recy

837
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,359
side effects all

838
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,240
right there's a a list of things you can

839
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,040
do so I want to read off some of these

840
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,720
some of these things if you're

841
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,720
going

842
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,640
somewhere and you're out and about and

843
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,480
you bang your head you injure your head

844
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,680
you get into an accident or you just

845
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,359
simply bang it in the car door somewhere

846
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,400
how many people get out of their car

847
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:58,160
bang it on the top of their door jam or

848
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,800

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,520
there's a list of things to do right

850
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,760
away first first thing you might want to

851
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,440
do is you might want to get some

852
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,880
cucumber juice in

00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:13,079
you right away celery juice in you right

854
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,119

855
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:18,760
orange juice in you right away okay even

856
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,440
if it's just that even if you just

857
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,520
choose one of these things so here you

858
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,359
go you bend your head not even

859
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,400
concussion level I'm just talking about

860
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,599
like an egg just like I was showing you

861
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,280
before you Bang Your Head freshly

862
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,000
squeezed orange juice right away if

863
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,240
that's what you have a bunch of oranges

864
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,520
then that's what you do okay all right

865
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,599
cucumber juice if you got a bunch of

866
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,880
cucumbers cucumber juice right away okay

867
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,160
another thing you can do is a heavy

868
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,760
metal detox smoothie if you already do

869
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,240
it here's one right here the spinach

870
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,359
soup that's in the medical medium books

871
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,880
get on the spinach soup that day doesn't

872
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,000
have to be in that moment but the same

873
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,160
day you injure your head it's important

874
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,480
right there okay okay so let's talk

875
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,480
about

876
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,960
supplementation if this if it's just one

877
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,400
thing you do like I tell family friends

878
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,640
after a like a head injury a headbang or

879
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,960
something happened an accident get on

880
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,920
curcumin right away just and whatever

881
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,560
curcumin you have just get on it right

882
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,920
away that's the vimergy one but I'm just

883
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,920
saying make sure you get human and get

884
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,760
on it so it's one thing right there

885
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,200
important vitamin C B12 B12 you get a

886
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,079
head injury B12 right away and I'll tell

887
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,920
you

888
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,359
why

889
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,960
nerves very important to know nerves

890
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,160
nerve

891
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:51,200
inflammation your brain slashes around

892
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,520
the demand for B12 is going to be off

893
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,720
the

894
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,480
chart the you will eat up your B12 like

895
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,520
nobody's business you bang your

896
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:06,760
head you eat up the B12 your head shakes

897
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,000
around a little you burn through your

898
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:15,040
B12 reserves every cell in your brain

899
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,440
every single cell in your skull is going

900
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,280
to be requiring B12 in that moment in

901
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,160
that crisis so B12 is critical for any

902
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,680
kind of stuff with head injuries any

903
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,480
kind of problems where you actually hurt

904
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,319
your head neck too included because

905
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,240
we're talking about the brain stem as

906
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,880
well even

907
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,480
neck because it can ring right up there

908
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,520
and get up there curcumin so what I like

909
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,119
about curcumin for any kind of head

910
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,599
injury any kind of bump on the Noggin is

911
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,680
it helps to get inflammation down it

912
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
helps to push it down so not only are

913
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,160
doing the ice and the ice packs and any

914
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,280
kind of bumps and bruises on your head

915
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,040
but you're doing the curcumin to help

916
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,760
bring that down and that's one of the

917
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,920
things that's in the protocol right

918
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,119
there cumin B12 is in there zinc's

919
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,640
another one so what I love about zinc is

920
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,880
it dumbs down the cyto storm right zinc

921
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,680
dumbs down the reaction that happens

922
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,760
when your body's in crisis you bang your

923
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,760
head I tell family and friends get on a

924
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,160
little bit of

925
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,680
zinc you Bang Your Head get on a little

926
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
bit of Z so that's right there something

927
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,200
that's really important to know vitamin

928
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,560
C is another one if it's only one thing

929
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,480
you have you only have beads 12 that's

930
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,160
when you use it right there one thing

931
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,880
you have vitamin C is another one too so

932
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,119
that's a great one because vitamin C

933
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,280
that high antioxidant level helps to

934
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:44,240
bring down that pre radical crap that

935
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,599
happens when your body goes into a

936
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,920
crisis State and all this junk is

937
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,760
produced from it that's another one too

938
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:56,040
all on its own and

939
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,319
then um check the book out when you can

940
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,920
there's other also other information in

941
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:03,760
there about that so that's brain saer

942
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,599
protocols I didn't kill myself on that

943
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,680
book so I can't you know so that people

944
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,040
you know don't have options I want to

945
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,160
make sure they have options they have a

946
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,800
chance to

947
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,760
heal and so there we go all right so

948
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,040
let's just make some food you guys I'm

949
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,599

966
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,319
pneumonia a lot of people are getting

967
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,240
pneumonia right now their lungs are

968
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:06,359
getting filled with

969
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,200
mucus there's some places in the United

970
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:13,040
States right now where hospitals are

971
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,960
overrun from this whole white lung thing

972
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,839
basically it's just a crappy

973
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,800
crappy bronchitis that instantly turns

974
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,480

really gnarly gives you a fever in the

976
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,440

00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,000
to lower the immune system

1054
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,760
allowing Epstein bar to rise up in a lot

1055
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,200
of people so they end up with so many

1056
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,800

00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,599
to do is take this potato here let's go

1093
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,599
with one more if you guys don't

1094
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,680
mind someone might say why is he talking

1095
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,240
about like you know head injuries and

1096
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,359
stuff I'll tell you

1097
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,000
why so many people with chronic illness

1098
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,800
their lives have changed because they

1099
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,720
banged their head they had a head injury

1100
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,839
of some kind and and it wasn't addressed

1101
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,800
properly and their nerves became frayed

1102
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:42,760
in in different areas and their brain

1103
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,520
stem and their cranial nerve became

1104
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:47,119
inflamed because of because of say

1105
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,480
Epstein bar and the shingles rising up

1106
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,680
because their immune system was knocked

1107
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,920
down so when we go through something

1108
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:56,040
like some kind of trauma our immune

1109
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:57,480
system drops we have an adrenaline surge

1110
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,599
when we go through some kind of trauma

1111
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,640
or adrenaline is just pouring pouring

1112
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,480
into our bloodstream from our adrenals

1113
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,680
pumping and pouring in and then our

1114
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,800
immune system starts to drop through the

1115
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,240
crisis right and then if someone's just

1116
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,960
on the edge of that that um Epstein bar

1117
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,240
breakout they're just on the edge of

1118
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,000
that simplex one breakout or that

1119
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,079
shingles breakout they get in trouble

1120
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,720
because some of those viruses like the

1121
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,200
obscene bar can cling to the nerves the

1122
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,599
root hairs from these nerves and then

1123
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,280
they're at the doctor's office like I

1124
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,240
got fibromyalgia now I got problems I

1125
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,599
never had before and they're just

1126
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,599
dealing with all all this

1127
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,800
stuff

1128
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,359
okay so I got some frozen peas over here

1129
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,160
I'm going to pop in a little bit I also

1130
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:48,400
have um some steam peas too I just

1131
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,720
thought I would have both some people

1132
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,200
steam them where they're soft like this

1133
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,480
I do love them like this I like them

1134
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,520
when they got this like really soft kind

1135
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,440
of kind of you know they're they lose

1136
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:05,160
some of that green color but they're so

1137
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:08,880
good though right and then you can have

1138
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,680
them differently too where kind of

1139
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,960
popping you can make them toasty but

1140
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,640
they're not as

1141
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,640
soft these are frozen

1142
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,280

1171
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,480
concussion you're Rec recovering from a

1172
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,240
concussion I'm so going through flare up

1173
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,839
yeah I feel so bad for you the

1174
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,160
concussions are just so annoying and

1175
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,680
they can really linger and it's

1176
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,319
important to kind

1177
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:54,400
of know what you can do for it like for

1178
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:56,119
instance the concussion protocol has a

1179
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,319
lot of different things in here to work

1180
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:02,400
with but there's a reason for it because

1181
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:05,760
we get these viral flares on top of

1182
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,760
concussion issues

1183
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,000
right I'm going to put some tomato in

1184
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,400
here not a lot I'm just going to put

1185
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,480
some it's kind of like this the

1186
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,920
concussion can be a problem all on its

1187
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,000
own because your head was shook your

1188
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,520
brain was shook but it also can trigger

1189
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,119
off other things that are inside of our

1190
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,839
body immune system drops

1191
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:32,160
lot of people suffer from concussion

1192
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:36,280
issues a year if you're young sometimes

1193
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,440
it takes a year to power through it I

1194
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,640
mean it just

1195
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,599
can depending on how bad look

1196
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,319
everybody's concussion is different but

1197
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:50,240
still cold white spring I saw they just

1198
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:54,359
recognized Long Haul flu

1199
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:58,720
oh they didn't recognize it they stole

1200
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:02,559
it ha published in a New York Times

1201
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:06,480
best-selling book also I live streamed

1202
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,480
all about it and lectured about it in

1203
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,400
2019 September 15 2019 talking about flu

1204
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:14,680
Long Haul flu meaning what happens you

1205
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,319
get the flu it knocks you down in your

1206
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:18,400
immune system and then all these other

1207
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,680
things start

1208
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:23,520
happening medical medium

1209
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:27,720
information right there and I did it

1210
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,240
before the pandemic so I published

1211
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:34,079
multiple

1212
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:38,599
Avenues of that but I was talking to

1213
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,359
somebody who um is scientist guy who's

1214
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,359
interested in medical medium books and

1215
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:44,319
he says like why don't we do a whole

1216
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:46,520
bunch of studies on this I'm like hey

1217
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:50,000
why not he said you know they're taking

1218
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:53,040
your info right I go yeah no I know I

1219
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,040
know they took

1220
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:58,240
that all right I thought they're the all

1221
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,319
knowing they're all powerful out there

1222
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,000
in the medical world why do they need my

1223
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:04,000
books why do they need my

1224
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:08,400
information like what's up with that I

1225
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,359
thought they knew everything and then

1226
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,960
they call me names at the same time and

1227
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:14,480
try to keep the medical medium down

1228
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,799
medical medium information down but they

1229
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,440
steal and they take and they poach it

1230
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:20,839
it's actually

1231
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,160

01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,679
campaign going on right

1632
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:43,840
now okay a campaign that it's

1633
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:45,360
multifaceted right it's to shame anybody

1634
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,320
who's following medical

1635
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,120
medium to shame everybody who's

1636
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,360
following medical medium

1637
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,719
right and then at the same time steal

1638
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:55,440
the medical medium information at the

1639
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:56,719
same time try to convince people who

1640
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,320
follow medical medium that the

1641
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:02,440
information isn't original and it's not

1642
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:03,800
from my books or from the medical medium

1643
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:05,600
at the same time trying to say medical

1644
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:09,719
meds of

1645
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,080
fraud like a campaign at the same

1646
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,600
time the medical establishment in the

1647
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,719
medical world and the medical system is

1648
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,480
stealing all the medical medium

1649
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,960
information and they're putting it

1650
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,760
online they have nothing to back it up

1651
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,520
we know we we've done the research and

1652
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,000
we've actually caught them in like

1653
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,880
hundreds of different places where they

1654
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,080
actually take it right out of the book

1655
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:33,080
right out of the books at the same time

1656
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:35,199
all of this is happening mm's being

1657
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,480
censored at the same time all that's

1658
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:39,960
happening

1659
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,560
like you know they must really fear me

1660
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:44,239

1662
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:48,840
these campaigns and then there's the and

1663
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:52,440
then this the crazy thing is we have all

1664
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,960

strong to withstand some of

1684
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,400
it years ago you know what they said

1685
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,199
about medical Med you're monopolizing

1686
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,520
the entire Health movement that's what

1687
01:14:56,199 --> 01:15:00,159
they

1688
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:03,320
said they said you're

1689
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:06,520
monopolizing the entire Health movement

1690
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:08,320
and what I said was no it's just that

1691
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:10,600
millions are healing worldwide that no

1692
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,000
one has ever seen before no one has ever

1693
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,080
seen this kind of healing with people

1694
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,320
with real chronic illness bedridden and

1695
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,800
getting out of their wheelchairs no

1696
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,239

1697
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,639
how many eat better books came out no

1698
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:21,840
matter how much stuff came out nobody

1699
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:23,840
ever seen that before and so what they

1700
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,000
did was they took

1701
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:29,000
they took that as all these people are

1702
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,520

1703
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,440

1704
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,840

by people in some of the Facebook groups

1781
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:18,080
I'm in they argue and tell me that

1782
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,600
there's no scientific evidence and I

1783
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:23,080

1784
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:25,719
medical medium saved my life makes me so

1785
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:27,159
mad how they are attacking us they are

1786
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:29,560
but they're not attacking anybody else

1787
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:32,480
out there this is what they're doing but

1788
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:36,159
they're told to do that you guys there's

1789
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,719
a campaign that's paid for too and

1790
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,600
there's other campaigns that aren't even

1791
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:42,199
paid for but there's some paid for

1792
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:45,400
campaigns and there's some non-paid for

1793
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:47,880
campaigns but there's campaigns running

1794
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,440
to actually confuse you tell you you're

1795
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,480
you know this is tell you the

1796
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,400
information is not good no matter how

1797
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,199
many millions have healed no matter how

1798
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,040
it saved your life that must be crap

1799
01:19:55,199 --> 01:20:00,719
that must be and then they

1800
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:02,480
throw all these stories out

1801
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,120
that are actually not even

1802
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:06,480
real and also just influencers are out

1803
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,960
there want to sell all their stuff now

1804
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:10,000
so what they do is they say about

1805
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,280
medical medium then it brings in a crowd

1806
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,440
because anything medical medium just

1807
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,560
brings people in right and they say

1808
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:17,080
about medical medium then people come in

1809
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,040
and then they do that so they can sell

1810
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,760
their they can sell other people's

1811
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,360
stuff and sell this and that and sell

1812
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,760
their stuff it's like it's crazy what's

1813
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,960
happening but it's just a storm we just

1814
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,560
have to ride through it that's all we

1815
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:34,000
have to just ride through it and we'll

1816
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:35,960
get to the other side of it meanwhile

1817
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,840
science research is taking medical M

1818
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:41,239
information and not citing it everywhere

1819
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,840
they're doing it on all the clinic Pages

1820
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:46,440
we we see it we we actually capture it

1821
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,280
they do it in all kinds of other

1822
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:52,600
places it's actually amazing it's

1823
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:55,120

out right here that is the ultimate sign

1827
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:08,960
that Med medical medium is legit because

1828
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:12,080
it's challenged so heavily that's the

1829
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:16,080
sign that's the ultimate sign that it is

1830
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:19,600
legit where did that medical information

1831
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:23,199
come from when no one had it before

1832
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,960
where did it come from came from above

1833
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,760
you know science when science research

1834
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,560
takes your information constantly like

1835
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,719
multiple sceris is caused by obscene bar

1836
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,840
I published it years before and then

1837
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:35,120
they took it how I've bars behind like

1838
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,560
all of a sudden all these symptoms and

1839
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,600
neurological stuff they didn't know that

1840
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:41,600
that's medical medium information in

1841
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,960
depth though like when they steal all

1842
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,239
that then you know it's legit you know

1843
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:49,040
it's Untouchable stuff and I was told

1844
01:21:47,239 --> 01:21:53,760
over and over again that you're

1845
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:56,199
monopolizing the entire Health movement

1846
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,400
because number one I was one of the

1847
01:21:56,199 --> 01:22:03,199

1848
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,400
