1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,240
cultivated blueberry wild blueberry

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,840
cultivated blueberry wild blueberry

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
every time I see a cultivated

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,839
blueberry every time I see it in the

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,400
store or I see somebody using it I feel

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,560
bad there's just something that comes

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,480
over me because it's weak I support it I

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,920
like blueberries of all kinds but it's

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,359
not the same blueberry it's not that

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,320
adaptogenic power it's not that high

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,039
antioxidant rate it's not any of that

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,599
the anthocyans are different it's not

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,160
not the same thing so I'll give you

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,320
little differences here a wild food can

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,079
survive on its own through drought

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,079
through floods through freezing Tundra

17
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,760
cold the cultivated blueberry was a

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,680
blueberry that wasn't just growing in

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,760
the wild so it's not like hey you know

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
these blueberries have been around for

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,840
thousands of years not true the

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:58,120
cultivated blueberry was a spinoff a

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,359
spin-off a cultivated spin-off from its

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,559
cousins the wild blueberry big

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,519
difference with the wild blueberry

26
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,960
versus the cultivated blueberry what

27
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,720
happens if a disease hits a crop if a

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,799
disease hits a crop the crop can get

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,720
annihilated and we're going to have

30
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,880
disease hitting crops in the future

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,360
because of all the GMO crops are not

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,560
going to be able to be strong enough

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,520
they're not going to be able to sustain

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,720
a massive blow and that will be coming

35
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,280
in the future with crops the difference

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
with what I'm saying is like a

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,400
cultivated crop like say the cultivated

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,360
blueberry if a fungus comes and

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,720
eventually becomes strong enough and

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,479
hits a sensitivity in the crop and takes

41
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,000
out an entire cultivated blueberry crop

42
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,920
worldwide which it can it can do that

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,240
for virtually any crop by the way if it

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,159
does this the whole crop goes the

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,960
difference with wild blueberries is

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
there are hundreds and hundreds and

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,320
hundreds of different strains of wild

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,960
blueberry plants in the same crop in the

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,320
same like if you look at a wild the

50
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,479
Blueberry Field this is important to

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:10,039
know there are hundreds of different

52
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,920
Geniuses I like just saying it that way

53
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,319
there are hundreds of different

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,440
varieties hundreds of different strains

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,120
they all look the same almost it's all

56
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,599
wild blueberries it's all sitting in the

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,280
field the difference is that there are

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,160
different plants even though it's the

59
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,120
same plant all within that field that

60
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,599
means that if disease comes to the wild

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,920
blueberry crop it may only take out one

62
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,319
or two species of plant amongst the

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,239
entire field of wild blueberries if a

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,440
disease comes to a cultivated crop it'll

65
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,000
wipe the entire cultivated crop out

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,200
that's how it works check it out W

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,879
