comes down to matcha tea when it comes

102
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
down to coffee when it comes comes down

103
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
to chocolate we're told right now

104
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
that it's really great for us that's

105
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,159
what we're told

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,319
but there's something inside of us all

107
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,959
that knows a little better than that

108
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
we know when we get jacked up we know

109
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
you when we get jacked

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,480
up on caffeine what that's like right

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,599
and i don't blame anyone at all

112
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,680
on any level for being on coffee

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,400
for being on chocolate for being on

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,120
matcha tea for being on caffeine at all

115
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,040
energy drinks i don't blame anybody at

116
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,920
all and i'm on your side are you kidding

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
me because

118
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,200
when you got some brain fog and you

119
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,480
don't feel that good

120
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,879
and you know life is hard and we kind of

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
we

122
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,680
we lean on these things i mean we can

123
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,519
have energy issues we cannot feel good

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,920
we can have fatigue

125
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
and you know the focus and concentration

126
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,760
so you guys

127
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,599
you have to know like i'm with you i'm

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,959
on your side if you have to do chocolate

129
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
if you have to do matcha tea if you have

130
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
to do coffee to survive

131
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,479
because you've got low energy issues and

132
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,720
fatigue and brain fog

133
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,680
and you can't think because something

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
else is going on

135
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
because that's the whole point where

136
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,479
we're a society today

137
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,919
the human race is bogged down with all

138
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,040
these symptoms now

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,000
and so we have to get jacked up on

140
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,560
caffeine

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
it's and then we get told that it's good

142
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
for us

143
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
because of a study that may comes that

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
may come out like antioxidants there

145
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
might be some antioxidants in matcha tea

146
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,479
there's some antioxidants in coffee

147
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,040
there's antioxidants and chocolate

148
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,840
and i talk about that too about about

149
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,280
studies

150
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,919
and how they might be kind of biased and

151
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,680
paid for by caffeine industry so it's

152
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,360
really interesting the whole thing is

153
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800

how that works on how the caffeine

355
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,680
just just stays in the emotional center

356
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
of the brain

357
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,519
and we have this relationship with

358
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,240
caffeine that we can't break

359

facebook youtube all of that please

383
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,279
share it because it's the only way it's

384
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
going to

385
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
get around because you've got to

386
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,399
remember medical medium information was

387
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,160
always grassroots

388
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,519
it was always people healing only and

389
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
that's how it spread around

390
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
the world and it's all through that

391
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,639
grassroots

392
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,920
it wasn't through any marketing it

393
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
wasn't through any of that

394
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,600
so i never had mark marketing big

395
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
marketing pr

396
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
never had any of that so the reason why

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
i got around was because it's healing

398
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
people and people

399
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
shared it so if you can keep on doing

400
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
that share the podcast because the

401
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
podcast

402
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,600

to the air freshener episode to the

408
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,279
caffeine episode that you're

409
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,040
that you're hearing um now that you can

410
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
hear now so

411
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,480
margie says i only had one coffee i

412
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,639
think you said

413
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,160
i think what was that it went back up

414
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
but it's it's interesting you know it's

415
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
like it's hard to

416
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
it's hard to get off our coffee much tea

417
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,480
but here's the thing i

418
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,240
support if you have to use it remember

419
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,160
that like i support if

420
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
if you're on coffee there's a reason why

421
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,120
you're on coffee you probably don't feel

422
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
that great you probably have some focus

423
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,000
concentration things going on

424
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
maybe some toxic heavy metals and

425
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,519
other things going on so i get it or

426
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,839
your adrenals they're just they're just

427
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,560
not up to par so then we use caffeine

428
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
to try to jack them up but then i talk

429
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,440
about how this can kind of hurt us

430
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,360
hurt us along the way and how we need to

431
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
protect ourselves and protect

432
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
our adrenals and protect our liver and i

433
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,440
talk about how

434
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
it's not as anti-aging as people think

435
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,839
it is so

436
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,079
very important there so yeah

437
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
you know what with coffee if you need

438
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,000
coffee to actually

439
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
keep yourself level you stay on it if

440
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
you need coffee to keep yourself level

441
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
you stay on it so

442
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,920
it's that kind of thing if if you have

443
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,440
if you know that it's the only way that

444
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,480
you're gonna push through

445
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,920
and you're doing all these other

446
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
incredible things for yourself then you

447
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,880
keep coffee in there

448
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,399

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,679
loss in women

750
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,600
with caffeine or when you're doing

751
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
caffeine for a few years or a couple

752
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,440
years or even 10 years and then you get

753
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,840
the hair thinning later for women

754
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,520
and how that's different for men but for

755
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,080
women how you get the hair thinning

756
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
because

757
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,440
women's adrenals and i talk about that

758
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,520
with caffeine it's really a powerful

759
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,120
episode talk about different symptoms

760
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,320
too and but when it comes down to the

761
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
meditations though

762
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,360
remember that when you do these

763
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,360
meditations they actually work

764
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,799
and because the meditations come from

765
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,039
above okay

766
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,080
they're not man-made and they come from

767
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,320
above so

768
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,640
they have the ability to draw that

769
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
poison out of the soul draw that hurt

770
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
