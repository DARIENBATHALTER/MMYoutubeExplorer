two

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,900
pathogen exposure shot

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,119
[Music]

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,279
and we're here and we're live

not

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,600
pre-recorded pathogen exposure shot

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,600
right here

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,040
amazing you guys I'm excited about it

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,040
brain saber that's what it's from

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,800
are you are you guys bumped up

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,559

just right here that alone is alkaline

23
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:06,420
anyway all right pathogen exposure

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,040
here we are this shot can be useful if

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,640

00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,540
through shared glasses

31
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,180
a drink

exposure shot later

47
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,799
incredible see guys brain saver word day

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,960

49
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,780

out therapy cleanse challenge call me

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,620

we're doing it

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,200
people have to realize there are bodily

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,599
fluids left on toilet seats

81
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,280
those people don't realize that I know

82
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,040
people that don't even think that they

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,019
don't think bodily fluids are on toilet

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,120
seats

85
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,000
those bodily fluids can contain

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,220
varieties of streptococcus they always

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,459
contain varieties of streptococcus

88
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,040
really many strains of which are

89
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,379
antibiotic resistant

90
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,700
definitely E coli

91
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,400
staff

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,200
herpes simplex 1 Herpes Simplex 2 are

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,519
always on toilet seats public restrooms

94
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,360
Epstein-Barr yes Epstein-Barr can be on

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,159
a toilet seat there are shingles hhv6

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:07,319
cytomegalovirus CMV

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,120
and HPV can be on a toilet seat that

98
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,900
means that these bugs can be on toilet

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,519
seats surfaces and usually are

100
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:22,019
indeed they truly usually are so public

101
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,300
restrooms that is what is on there

102
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,000
they're covering toilet seats

103
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,540
so this is critical flopping down

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,220
straight onto a public toilet seat is

105
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,220
not a wise practice

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,940
if there's anything to take away if it's

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,160
just one thing and that's all

108
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,500
just one thing to take away from meta

109
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,960
from volumes of medical medium

110
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,180
information

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,620
if you want to throw away everything and

112
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,940
take one one thing with you let it be

113
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,280
flopping down straight onto a public

114
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,280
toilet seat is not a wise practice

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,660
then there's then there's the toilet

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,620
water in the bowl

117
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,160
even if the toilet was flushed but

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,380
toilets never truly flush

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,360
pretty crazy isn't that there's always

120
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,740
invisible leftover material floating

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,740
around in the toilet water

122
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,100
and as you go to the bathroom why do I

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,520
think that's funny that's not a funny

124
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,800
thing but why am I laughing here

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,100
if you if you go

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,740
and as you go to the bathroom

127
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:41,220
splashes from the water can pop up back

128
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,860
into you okay

129
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,080
it's very easy to get infected in

130
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,080
restrooms because when you're going to

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
the bathroom you're exposed

132
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,039
for example when someone is having a

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,539
bowel movement their rectum doesn't

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,539
immediately close

135
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,979
these are really good books these brain

136
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,220
saver books are mind-blowing

137
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,360
as their fecal matter Torpedoes into the

138
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,880
water

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,639
it's very easy for that water to Splash

140
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,520
up and enter into the rectum as the

141
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,500
rectum is still closing you guys were

142
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,440
day two of the medical medium brain shot

143
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,180
therapy challenge okay and we're going

144
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,699
to be doing 20 days if you just got on

145
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,680
here reading out a brain saver all right

146
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,360
so I'm excited about this is good

147
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,860
information to be talking about we're

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,660
just talking about pathogen exposure

149
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,060
shock maybe you weren't on a public

150
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,860
restroom recently but there's other

151
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,560
reasons through the pathogen exposure

152
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,520
shot it's really a powerful healing shot

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,520
in so many ways

154
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,580
before you poo

155
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,380
it's best to place a sheet or two of

156
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,860
toilet paper on the surface of the water

157
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,380
to mitigate splash

158
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,400
this might sound ridiculous for a second

159
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,400
but it's not

160
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,639
how many people don't realize how many

161
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,840
bugs they contract sitting on a public

162
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
restroom toilet

163
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,100
dropping a poo in the toilet and then it

164
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,620
sends water right up into the rectum

165
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,479
before the rectum closes

166
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,880
and now they have a brand new

167
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,400
streptococcus one that's antibiotic

168
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,699
resistant that some other person had in

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,280
their body because they took 20

170
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,280
billion antibiotics in the course of

171
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,440
their lifetime the kind of mitigate and

172
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,259
keep that

173
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:37,800
streptococcus under control as it gave

174
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,780
size and sore throats and UTIs and

175
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,860
bladder infections and kidney infections

176
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,919
and

177
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,539
and acne and acne yeah because acne

178
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,300
streptococcus that's what acne is it's

179
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:51,360
not hormones it's streptococcus

180
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,099
so it's best to place a sheet or two of

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,300
toilet paper on the surface of the water

182
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,300
to mitigate splash

183
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,340
because it stops the splash

184
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,620
to protect yourself further it's

185
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:07,259
important to flush a public toilet

186
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,780
before you even use it if you go into a

187
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,680
public restroom flush the toilet before

188
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,680
you use it

189
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,160
if it's a urinal urinal

190
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,500
you don't want to flush that one I'm

191
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,740
talking about a toilet

192
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,120
not one of those you know urinals right

193
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,180
those when you hit that when you hit

194
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,919
that that thing right splashes

195
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,760
everybody's urine all you know other

196
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,260
guys urine right on you right

197
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,260
but I'm talking about the toilet

198
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,440
it's important to flush a public toilet

199
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,440
before you even use it if it has a lid

200
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,300
put the lid down before flushing it so

201
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,880
when you're in a public bathroom put the

202
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,200
lid down before flushing it

203
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,940
foreign

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,920
did you guys expect we'd be talking

205
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,240
about this today at all on day two of

206
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,519
the medical beam breaks out there be

207
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,320
quench challenge

208
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,320
you flush with your foot I just saw

209
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,899
other way otherwise try to turn away or

210
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,620
back away while it's Flushing

211
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm on page 195 of the brain saver book

212
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,860
the Mist can project outward with

213
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,080
viruses or bacteria in it so you want to

214
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,600
shut the lid of the toilet

215
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,899
you never want to keep the lid of a

216
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,160
toilet open on a plane

217
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,160
before you flush it

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,000
because when you're on a plane if you

219
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,880
don't shut that lid it literally

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,880
will shoot up right into your face

221
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,899
if there's a lid laugh out loud then you

222
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,480
got to turn around Jackie B gotta turn

223
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,339
around away like I was just reading

224
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,240
liziam says this is the manual we needed

225
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,240
when we were born

226
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,080
Erica Malik says so many don't have lids

227
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,399
I know

228
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,580
I know

229
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,720
many people won't use enough toilet

230
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,720
paper to wipe

231
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,459
don't use like one sheet

232
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,940
so they'll use one sheet fine I totally

233
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,880
get it but

234
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,860
one sheet right they use a few tiny

235
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,779
sheets perhaps in the name of saving

236
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,540
trees or if they're in the habit of

237
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,760
using less to save money of course or

238
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,399
they just miss the target

239
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,720
they end up with a handful of feces so

240
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,140
what happens when people go to bathroom

241
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,620
they usually 95 of the people have a

242
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,100
handful of the feces of course

243
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,079
that hand will then flush the toilet

244
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,459
so we're talking about the toilet handle

245
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,440
now you guys if you're talking about

246
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,180
there's another handle so someone just

247
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,560
went to the bathroom they wiped their

248
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,760
ass with a couple of sheets they got

249
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
feces on their hand and now they're

250
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,779
flushing the toilet right

251
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
because not every place is automatic

252
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,680
flush

253
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,899
that hand will then flush a toilet

254
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,480
toilet if it's not automated

255
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,519
it's not automated

256
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,399
then that hand will touch the soap

257
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,839
dispenser and this it's Spencer and the

258
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,720
sink handles

259
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,760
leaving behind more feces particles and

260
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,339
then after they wash their hands they'll

261
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,440
touch the dirty handles again to shut

262
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,720
off the sink

263
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,180
so it's like you turn the sink on you

264
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,260
have feces on your hand you're washing

265
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,620
your hands

266
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,300
the feces is on the handles and then

267
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,980
you're done washing your hands and then

268
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,480
you shut the handles off again you shut

269
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,040
the handle off again and you got feces

270
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,200
back on your hand tear Appleman says the

271
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,399
toilets are flush while you're sitting

272
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,800
on them

273
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,800
yeah that's that's a tough one

274
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,560
all right

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,300
even if

276
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,100
their own hands are clean they're

277
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,899
touching handles that other people have

278
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,459
touched those other people could have

279
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:11,480
touched their eyes

280
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,480
blown their nose

281
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,720
or just touched their face while

282
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,300
applying makeup in the bathroom mirror

283
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,940
then as everyone exits the bathroom

284
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,600
they're touching the spot on the door

285
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,760
everyone else has put their hands on

286
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,700
what I try to do in the public restroom

287
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,120
is I look for any other spot to open the

288
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:35,040
door if I can a spot that I don't think

289
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,899
someone touched and I'll even ask Spirit

290
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,760
of compassion nobody

291
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,260
anybody touch the bottom of the handle

292
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,700
and spirit confession to say a whole

293
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,060
bunch of people use the bottom of the

294
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,060
handle

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,339
hand sanitizer does not stop all of

296
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,019
these hand body exposures it's it's a

297
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,480
noble idea

298
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,940
partially helpful sometimes and yet hand

299
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,339
sanitizer is random in its ability to

300
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,779
kill pathogens it's not good enough we

301
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,700
have to be careful about how we use

302
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,500
public facilities to stay mind hold that

303
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,180
pathogen transmission is common in

304
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,700
restrooms

305
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,880
that's one of the biggest places that

306
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,860
pathogen transmission occurs it's in the

307
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
restrooms anyway we're talking about the

308
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,220
pathogen exposure shot this is day two

309
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,500

signed up to the cleanse challenge the

321
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,360
brain shot therapy challenge so I just

322
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,360
want to remind everybody so

323
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,160
sharing food and drink and dining out

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,120
be mindful of sharing food and drink

325
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,160
you're also sharing saliva sometimes

326
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,160
even microscopic blood particles

327
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,339
sometimes we share food and drink

328
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,620
knowingly as when we eat off the same

329
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,660
plate or drink out of the same bottle or

330
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,680
glass sometimes we share with other

331
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,000
people unknowingly

332
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,160
restaurants do not usually clean their

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,160
glasses properly there tends to be

334
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,160
residue on all the glasses

335
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,880
lipstick residue for example tends to

336
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,100
hold on to pathogens on glasses so

337
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,040
that's just people don't realize the

338
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,959
restaurants and bars they don't wash

339
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,079
those glasses good

340
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,019
lipstick could sit residue on the

341
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,079
glasses just over and over again

342
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:52,139
lipstick encapsulates pathogens protects

343
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:54,600
them like a waxy protective cover

344
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,519
keeping the bugs sustained on the

345
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,260
glasses for days

346
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,240
so if you're drinking your glass at the

347
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,740
restaurant lipstick is

348
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,540
holding

349
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,519
and harboring

350
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,959
leftover lipstick on the glasses you

351
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,760
can't even see the leftover lipstick

352
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,699
it's not like see me read a perfect red

353
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,600
print like red lipstick like

354
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,600
it's print on there

355
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,459
check this one out

356
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,339
see if this sounds appetizing

357
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:26,339
Benny Jen says bars rinse their glasses

358
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,440
a rinse isn't good enough

359
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,079
that's for sure

360
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,160
that would not make me feel confident if

361
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:38,040
I was in a bar we rinsed our glasses

362
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,100
great all right

363
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,500
um by the way you just touched the glass

364
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,540
from the inside of the glass as you've

365
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,880
got it ready in hand and filled it up

366
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,339

glass

God knows what was on your hands when

you just went to the bathroom is there a

371
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:01,459

foreign

374
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,139
sounds appetizing okay you guys

375
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,260
many men

376
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,260
have extremely sticky saliva

377
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,260
barf

378
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,620
right I don't know is it does that make

379
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,839
you like does that make when I heard

380
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,519
that from spiritual compassion like how

381
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,560
would how would anybody know that

382
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,839
there's no science on that there's no

383
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,180
report on that there's no study on that

384
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,940
sort of capacity told me that men have

385
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,420
really sticky saliva and when I heard

386
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,579
that I was like we do like what what do

387
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,759
you mean we have sticky saliva I was

388
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,759
like

389
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,339
foreign

390
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,660
many men have sticky extremely sticky

391
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,199
saliva because men often go around

392
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:58,800
chronically dehydrated

393
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:03,240
eating protein heavy diets

394
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,000
and protein is extremely sticky

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,120
and proteins are extremely sticky Foods

396
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,939
higher protein diets tend to make saliva

397
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,179
very very gluey

398
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:18,959
men's saliva can sit on glasses for a

399
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:20,939
week after multiple Washings

400
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,679

okay

410
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,500
Forks in restaurants oh my God

411
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,320
Forks

412
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,900
dude

413
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:59,120
Forks in restaurants just like Forks at

414
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,120
home create small injuries in the mouth

415
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,460
small injuries in the mouth

416
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,460
unnoticeable

417
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,200
the steel in Forks is porous

418
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:18,480
metal forks stick into the person's gums

419
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,200
dislodging tiny bits of plaque and gum

420
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
bacteria

421
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,140
this is why I don't use forks in a

422
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,679
restaurant

423
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,679
Olga says even a dishwasher can't rid of

424
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,700
that no way people's lipstick gluey

425
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,500
saliva in in restaurants

426
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:40,140
notoriously two in restaurants that

427
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,500
stuff doesn't leave those glasses easy

428
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,419
me too 787 on YouTube good to see you

429
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,700
the hot water would often run out when

430
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,039
it was busy at the restaurant I worked

431
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,720
at uh-huh and I've heard that a billion

432
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,380
times by the way but dishes were still

433
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,720
being washed correctamundo

434
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,120
I've totally seen that I've heard that

435
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,360
so many times too

436
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,580
me too that was good thank you

437
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,340
metal forks sticking to the person's

438
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,200
gums dislodging tiny bits of plaque and

439
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,840
gum bacteria

440
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,340
compressing it into the pores of the

441
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,520
fork

442
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:21,660
you know that right that that's

443
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:25,320
plaque and skin flakes inside the mouth

444
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,140
skin cells being pressed into the fork

445
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,419
the porous parts of the fork so the

446
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,940
pores in the silverware get clogged up

447
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:38,480
with cells from the inside of people's

448
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:38,480
mouths including micro amounts of blood

449
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,260
restaurant

450
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,640
Forks okay

451
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,640
filled with all of that

452
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:55,160
Forks in restaurants can be biohazards

453
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,160
nobody knew that

454
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,480
watch it be talked about now out there

455
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,840
well poached once again for the medical

456
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,419
meeting books and not cited

457
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,880
they're not sterilized as if you were at

458
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,679
the dentist's office at the dentist's

459
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,780
office before they stick metal in your

460
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,059
mouth you guys they have to put it in

461
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,460
the sterilization machine or open up a

462
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:21,440
brand new one

463
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,440
they're not doing that at the restaurant

464
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:29,760
they're not sterilized as if you were at

465
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,980
the dentist's office where a sterilized

466
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,860
tool goes in your mouth even if it's

467
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,299
just poking around on a tooth let me

468
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,080
look here

469
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:44,760
okay Jessica let's just take a look yep

470
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,760
yep poking in here does that hurt oh

471
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,760
instead eating with bar or restaurant

472
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,160
silverware is like going to the dental

473
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,740
office where they take all their dental

474
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,660
tools and wash them by hand or throw

475
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,940
them in a common dishwasher would you

476
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,500
like the dentist to just take all their

477
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,059
dental tools and put it in a common

478
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,580
dishwasher

479
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,679
don't worry

480
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,260
um assistant

481
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,720
um Dental nurse hygienist nurse

482
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,059
hygienist can you go back at the

483
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,760
dishwasher back there and can you get

484
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,020
all the dental tools out we ran it on

485
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,500
clean

486
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,500
cycle whatever rinse rinse cycle

487
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,299
as is mind-blowing my mind is blown my

488
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,740
mind was blown when Spirit of compassion

489
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,700
gave me the info to begin with I was

490
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,980
like what

491
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,539
I mean I've known some of it that Spirit

492
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,740
of passion has given to me why I go to

493
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,539
restaurants and stuff but when I really

494
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,320
think about the details around it too

495
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,320
it's been insane

496
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,820
because most dishwashers do not get hot

497
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,980
enough to kill pathogens that's another

498
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,919
thing dishwashers in restaurants aren't

499
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,419
hot enough to kill pathogens you gotta

500
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:02,419
have some serious Heat

501
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,280
before putting them in your mouth or the

502
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,440
next patient

503
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,360
that's why I say that utensils in

504
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,760
restaurants can be biohazards

505
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,440
potentially spreading every pathogen and

506
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,200
disease

507
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,340
and for years I've said that busy chefs

508
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,320
oh I know chefs hate me too

509
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,340
everybody hates me now it's been

510
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,340
building up for years

511
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,480
leaving chefs hate me now and for years

512
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
I've said that busy chefs in busy

513
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,260
restaurants often cut their hands and

514
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,179
fingers daily

515
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,179
which is Russian Roulette

516
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,919
for transmitting any kind of pathogen

517
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,940
oh

518
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,840

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,580

when I'm at a restaurant I'll say can I

540
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,880
have a mug of scalding hot water

541
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,179
like you know for tea

542
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,400
and then I place my utensils in that so

543
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:52,140
they bring a mug of scalding hot water

544
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,600
lake for tea

545
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,720
and then I'll take my fork in the

546
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:01,020
restaurant plop that in there like that

547
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:03,419
and just let it sit there for a while

548
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,440
is that not the coolest or what that's

549
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,580
the coolest

550
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,440
people want to know what the medical

551
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,780

order food that doesn't require utensils

555
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,360

564
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,880
utensils are still dry so sorry she said

565
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,340
when the utensils are still dirty after

566
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,000
the washer they just dip in water and

567
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,000
wipe them

568
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,240
now I believe it

569
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,260
so alternatively you could bring your

570
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,400
own utensils which I've done but I do

571
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,039
you know

572
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,820
like to put the utensils in a hot you

573
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:01,559
know mug of water there too if I can

574
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,720
or I'll order something that doesn't

575
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,679
require using utensils then I'll make

576
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,679
sure my hands are clean

577
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,140
ask for your food to go this is an

578
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,340
important tip right here if you're

579
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,559
eating out in restaurants you guys

580
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,200
seriously check this out this is just

581
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,880
incredible ask for your food to come

582
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,980
very hot

583
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,679
if the chef cut their finger while

584
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,159
preparing your meal or there's foodborne

585
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,200
pathogens on there too the heat of the

586
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,419
food and the plate is a great way to

587
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,419
kill viruses that may be in that blood

588
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:36,120
of the chef that got it on your food

589
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,460
if you're doing a raw dish then that's

590
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,960
not you know raw salad obviously you

591
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,880
can't throw it in heat you know in the

592
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,320
oven but ask for your food to come

593
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,100
really hot if you're ordering cooked

594
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,799
food

595
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,799
that's what I've done in a restaurant

596
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,200
because I worry about eating raw food in

597
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,900
a restaurant because I don't know if

598
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,559
chicken juices went and spilled on raw

599
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,659
chicken on my my lettuce

600
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:05,820
and I would also do the pathogen

601
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,220
exposure shot when you come home after

602
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,940
you ate at the restaurant and maybe even

603
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,940
before you go

604
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,279
how about this one

605
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,080
ask for beverages that come in bottles

606
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,620
that haven't been opened to avoid

607
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,260
drinking out of glasses I've done that

608
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,000
I've consumed beverages out of bottles

609
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,500
because I didn't want to drink out of

610
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,059
the glass I'd be like can you give me a

611
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,799
bottle

612
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:34,500
ready for this though

613
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,360
wipe off the top and the neck of the

614
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,120
bottle with an alcohol wipe before

615
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,620
drinking because then the bottle gets

616
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,539
brought to you

617
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,840
by a waiter

618
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:48,120
that has possibly 10 viruses and bugs

619
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,860
and bacteria and feces on their hands

620
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,820
because it's just going to happen and

621
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,860
then

622
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,200
or the waiter was grabbing everybody's

623
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,240
dirty dishes and forks and stuff like

624
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,159
that and then oh yeah I'll get you a

625
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,539
bottle would you like sparkling water

626
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,539
get you a bottle here it is

627
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,580
wipe off the top and neck of the bottle

628
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,580
with alcohol white before drinking gas

629
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,559
your lips May slip past the part of the

630
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,299
bottle that had been under the cap onto

631
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,159
the area where the server was touching

632
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,440
the bottle as They carried it because

633
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,260
you know when you drink the bottle your

634
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,559
lips might slap you know they might slip

635
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,539
past that top of the bottle

636
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,480
and you know hit the area that's

637
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:33,299
wherever contaminated

638
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,260
if bottles aren't an option ask for a

639
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,700
can

640
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,260
but then you're dealing with aluminum

641
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,159
but hey look you do the best you can

642
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,279
make sure you're doing the heavy metal

643
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,320
detox cleanses that are in these books

644
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,360
in which case try to wipe down the rim

645
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,799
and pour area of the can before opening

646
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,539
I understand you have to drink out of a

647
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,039
can for some situation I'm on board

648
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,200
whatever

649
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,299
not shaming anybody there's just ways of

650
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,820
doing it right to protect yourself

651
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:59,400
lesser evils

652
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,039
if you're forced to drink out of a glass

653
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,080
this is interesting

654
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,740
if you're forced to drink out of a glass

655
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,039
ask for a wrapped straw or bring your

656
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,020
own straw

657
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,220
if you can bring your own cup and glass

658
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,220
to the restaurant too

659
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,220
all right so let's talk about dental

660
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,159
visits for a couple of seconds pathogen

661
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,620
exposure shot here's a comment right

662
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:28,020
here on oh Miss Candy

663
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:31,740
it's people like you that cause Mass

664
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:34,740
hysteria about germs and not wanting to

665
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:37,679
get them and then staying in and never

666
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,140
leaving their homes really germs are

667
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,480
okay

668
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:45,480
ah you're one of those people

669
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,480
interesting

670
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,860
well first of all I would like to

671
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,940
respond to that comment very much so

672
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,580
so

673
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:00,179
if germs are okay

674
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,520
right what about all the people that

675
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,919
have lost your lives to germs was it

676
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,340
okay for them

677
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:11,720
what about all the elderly people that

678
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,720
were knocked off by covet

679
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:19,500
was germs okay for them in the moment

680
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,299
how many people died of covid

681
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,000
how many people die of the flu every

682
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:26,700
year was germs okay for them

683
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,679
I'm just wondering

684
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,760
well we can't ask them because they're

685
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,520
gone

686
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:35,460
so we can't call those people up and say

687
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,919
you were in a nursing home and they

688
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,260
weren't careful there

689
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,600
and covet ran through it

690
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,179
or you know

691
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,799
Kobe ran through your house and knocked

692
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,980
off your aunt

693
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:53,340
or your grandmother grandfather but we

694
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,460
can't ask them if germs were okay

695
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,279
with them we can't ask them it's really

696
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,720
ignorant ignorant thing you just said

697
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,279
you don't know the cause of chronic

698
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,399
illness

699
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,960
it's actually pathogens germs

700
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:08,340
so you got people that are better and

701
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,980
you got moms that can't get out of bed

702
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,899
to feed their children

703
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,820
you got teenagers that are suffering

704
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:18,600
with autoimmune right now because of

705
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:21,120
germs viruses and bacteria

706
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,760
but you're but you're really ignorant

707
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,899
about all of this and I'm not blaming

708
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,000
you

709
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:28,860
but you should probably learn something

710
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,080
here

711
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,299
and not be really

712
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,039
you know

713
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,740
dumb about it

714
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,539
awareness is actually the key of knowing

715
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,919
so you can keep precautions so if you're

716
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,240
somebody really suffering with chronic

717
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,640
illness right now and you had a hard

718
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,500
time in your life and you you already

719
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,820
have neurological fatigue because you're

720
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,620
dealing with a mystery illness because

721
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,320
you're dealing with like a virus like

722
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,120
Epstein-Barr giving you brain

723
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,860
inflammation and everything else like I

724
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,240
talk about the brain books you're

725
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,240
already suffering

726
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,039
you don't need more epstein-bars you

727
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,140
don't need more simplexes you don't need

728
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:07,140
more Simplex too you don't need more

729
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,460
anything you need more streptococcus if

730
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,380
you're already suffering with acne

731
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,840
because of strep

732
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,520
do you need more more germs do you need

733
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,159
more streptococcus because you can have

734
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:19,559
even worse acne I mean

735
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:21,360
you don't want you don't want to pick up

736
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,340
three different strips from using public

737
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,679
restrooms wrong knowing how to take

738
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,860
precautions and and how you know this

739
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,679
has your back protecting you so you

740
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,200
don't live a Lifetime on antibiotics

741
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,640
you pick up two more streptococcus off

742
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,919
of a toilet seat

743
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,840
and now you're gonna like more UTIs and

744
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,940
you're on antibiotics

745
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,320
is that a good thing so you really like

746
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,880
germs

747
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,919
that would probably be the stupidest

748
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,899
thing comment I've ever read in a long

749
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:50,640
time actually

750
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,760
someone of those people that make people

751
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,740
afraid of germs come on the darkness

752
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,020
wants you to be in the dark and not know

753
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,640
about any of these germs in any of these

754
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,620
bugs they don't the darkness doesn't

755
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,419
want you to protect yourself

756
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,039
classified medical research and Sciences

757
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,840
want you to protect yourself no one

758
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,240
wants you to protect yourself they want

759
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,520
you sick sick or sicker sicker do you

760
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,740
pay the price until you're gone bye they

761
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,320
just want you to go

762
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,120
so yeah

763
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,919
and if you're under that if you're under

764
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,140
that thought

765
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,799
if you're under that belief that germs

766
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:28,919
make you stronger oh really

767
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,659
oh they do they make you stronger

768
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:33,179
uh-huh

769
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,100
tell that to somebody who just got mono

770
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,860
and it beat the

771
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,380
crap out of them

772
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,880
it really makes you stronger and now

773
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,740
they got thyroid problems five years

774
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,240
later and now they've got fibromyalgia

775
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,100
five years later because if I've seen

776
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,899
bar oh that made them stronger

777
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,020
this information is so you can be aware

778
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:53,880
and know how to kill pathogens

779
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,279
that's what this is it's so you can use

780
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,720
your own free will to actually Empower

781
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,940
yourself and be like you know what I'm

782
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,520
not gonna be a sucker anymore and I'm

783
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,020
not going to be brainwashed anymore and

784
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,700
I'm going to have my Free Will and use

785
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,899
my Free Will and protect myself from

786
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,899
pathogens in the whole bit

787
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,700
so you can defend yourself because the

788
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,500
chronically ill they can't defend

789
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,880
themselves

790
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,460
it's hard

791
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,860
the system's not set up for them to do

792
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:25,260
that there are things we can do and be

793
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,019
smart about as we go along

794
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,320
our way things to protect ourselves with

795
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,600
so when someone says a comment like that

796
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,840
it just shows me how

797
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,480
really out of touch you are and also

798
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,340
you've never been sick yet

799
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,600
with chronic illness but when you get

800
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,980
chronic illness we'll see what you're

801
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,799
we'll see who's laughing down the road

802
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,100
then you'll be all upset

803
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,159
our Schroeder said I love how he reads

804
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,620
all comments either good or bad he's so

805
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,539
honest I try my best and I'm at your

806
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,340
service

807
00:33:56,539 --> 00:34:01,740
and that's your service I'll even do a

808
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,659
curtsy Nicholas Russell says people

809
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:07,019
think germs strengthen their immune

810
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:09,799
systems oh really

811
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,799
really

812
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,139
that's why you know so many people are

813
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,540
dying right now that's unbelievable me

814
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,060
too 787 it's amazing that so many are

815
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,639
under the spell of more exposure makes

816
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,080
you stronger but stay away from Grandma

817
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,599
if you're sick exactly

818
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,820
contradictions

819
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,119
constant contradictions

820
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,280
that's what that is exactly

821
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,740
exactly

822
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,960
germs make you stronger let me go pick

823
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,359
up another Simplex herpes one cold sore

824
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,339
virus and now I got trigeminal neuralgia

825
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm suffering and I'm on a whole bunch

826
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,000
of freaking oxies

827
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,220
how many people are literally on opioids

828
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:57,960
prescribed from their doctor because

829
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,060
their trigeminal neurologist making it

830
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,760
so they can't even live

831
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,339
because of herpes simplex one oh so let

832
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,540
me go and catch another and maybe two

833
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,540
more and not be aware

834
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,940
I mean I can go on all day but we're in

835
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,859
the brain shot therapy cleanse challenge

836
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,920
yep

837
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:21,480
MV Doom over there on YouTube so if

838
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,339
you're completely healthy you should

839
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,720
still be taking all the precautions yeah

840
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:26,579
of course

841
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,920
of course you should because guess what

842
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:30,540
no one stays completely healthy and by

843
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,339
the way no one is completely healthy now

844
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,980
in this day and age

845
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:37,380
everybody has something

846
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,300
gnawing at them

847
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,800
and yeah if you don't stay aware of it

848
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,420
you'll collect all these pathogens and

849
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,520
get sicker down the road

850
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,180
I don't know if anybody's watching the

851
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,180
world right now

852
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:54,180
but the drugstores have lines of people

853
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,640
sick like never before in our history

854
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,920
the medical industry

855
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,060
is like crashing hospitals are filled

856
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,520
with people

857
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,640
the world has changed everybody's

858
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,140
getting sick everybody's sick you might

859
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,060
be healthy right now strong and

860
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,920
everything's good

861
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,200
and if you don't take care of yourself

862
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,619
and know without what to look out for to

863
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,099
protect yourself boom

864
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:23,160
the scale is tipped Heidi Curtis says

865
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:24,660
I'd rather know the truth viruses were

866
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,579
making me super sick until I found

867
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,460
medical meme information I'm so grateful

868
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:32,220
it's critical to know the truth and then

869
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,720
because you've already been sick from

870
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,760
any kind of viruses you've already had

871
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,160
pathogen exposure in your life it's good

872
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,980
to actually know what to look out for so

873
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,500
you don't add to it sure somebody else

874
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,940
out there who's not sick enough yet or

875
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,400
they're not so sick and they're just

876
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,140
going to their acupuncturist for some

877
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,820
you know little bit of needles in their

878
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,440
back or they're going to get a massage

879
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,960
once a while or they go see their

880
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,119
routine doctor for a checkup

881
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,579
because they get a headache once every

882
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,500
six months those people we're gonna are

883
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,420
gonna get sick down the road too they're

884
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,280
not looking out for exposures they're

885
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,260
not looking into anything they're gonna

886
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,900
get sick later anyway because it happens

887
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,420
every day just because

888
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,920
you don't know about it and are not

889
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,420
aware of what's going on out there

890
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,240
doesn't mean it's not happening that's

891
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,720
where ignoring things bites you in the

892
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,720
butt

893
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,160
anyway

894
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,160

it for a little bit all right

937
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,540
the dentist's office is another place

938
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:18,060
where pathogens are transferred

939
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,339
often dentists hygienists and assistants

940
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,700
will put oh my God

941
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:27,500
will put on their gloves and then start

942
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,500
touching everything with their gloves

943
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,720
the dentist and the hygienist and the

944
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,359
the assistant at the dentist office is

945
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,720
wearing their gloves to protect them not

946
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,720

00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,260

hygienist is wearing nitrile gloves phew

950
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:58,200
meanwhile the hygienist is grabbing this

951
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,320
boom grabbing that grabbing this in here

952
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,240
opening up drawers grabbing this and who

953
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,339
knows what's on the gloves right now and

954
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,339
then I was going in here like this

955
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,780
you know

956
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,460
after they had their hands in other

957
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,839
people's mouths too like all kinds of

958
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,220
different stuff like meaning and then

959
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,660
they're touching everything right now

960
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,280
they're touching all those surfaces

961
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,440
again of course it might take a little

962
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,480
handy wipe and go oh well I'll do the

963
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,680
light handle there I'll do this for a

964
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
second I'll do this for a second

965
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,560
and they don't even do that

966
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,940
they're touching the handles of the

967
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,800
lights adjusting them and also touching

968
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:43,740
chairs controls computer keyboards

969
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,780
computer keyboards yeah totally

970
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,460
in the end they're latex or nitrile

971
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,839
gloves are only protecting the

972
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,140
practitioner

973
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,260
dude not protecting the patient

974
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:59,660
drives me crazy corn EMA says I was a

975
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,660
dental assistant that's so true

976
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,700
bana says they keep saying that if you

977
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,460
get sick your immune system is getting

978
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,740
better I was sick as child very often

979
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,660
and I didn't miss sorry and I didn't see

980
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,660
any improvements in my immune system

981
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,980
it's just really just make believe when

982
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,020
they say that

983
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,020
the more germs the stronger you get

984
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:38,960
here's a cool Agostino on YouTube my dad

985
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,960
is a dentist and this is true

986
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,700
I believe you

987
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,700
yet the surfaces are touching with those

988
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,680
new gloves may have saliva blood is this

989
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,660
true

990
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,820
yet the services they're touching with

991
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,880
those new gloves may have saliva blood

992
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,460
and mouth tissue cells on them

993
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,119
and those surfaces have often not been

994
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:08,400
sterilized between patients

995
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,400
that's how pathogens can be transmitted

996
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,500
all right so let me read this next

997
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,480
little part if you guys got another

998
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,520
second

999
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,579
to avoid this situation bring your own

1000
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,700
disinfecting wipes to the dentist and

1001
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,980
ask them to wipe down high touch spots

1002
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,720
such as controls buttons and handles

1003
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,300
that they think they're going to use

1004
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,700
during your procedure

1005
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,220
and ask them to put on fresh gloves

1006
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,839
afterwards so after they do all that

1007
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,339
have them put on another set of gloves

1008
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:44,280
you can't be afraid to ask your dentist

1009
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:45,960
for better sanitary steps to be taken if

1010
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,880
people learn to request this it will

1011
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,420
become more common practice in the

1012
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,420

1013
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,180

public spaces that's the thing

1058
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,579

1066
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,520
after a visit at the dental office

1067
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:05,420
especially around flu season

1068
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,420
which is now

1069
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,000
you know be careful with shopping carts

1070
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,740
too then they say medical medium

1071
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,740
information didn't work

1072
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:21,900
I started medical medium yeah I've been

1073
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,300
doing it for like a month

1074
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,040
I'm doing my celery juice I'm listening

1075
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,540
to this crazy guy I'm doing medical

1076
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,540
medium

1077
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,280
yeah and then I got so sick

1078
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:35,160
so sick

1079
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,380
my stomach got sick I got a fever I was

1080
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,240
so sick I was coughing during that

1081
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,619
medical medium meanwhile they were at

1082
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,280
the dentist's office picked up the flu

1083
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,839
or stomach flu got sick

1084
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,640
yeah

1085
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,640
or yeah I started medical medium

1086
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,920
and it was something else that got them

1087
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,920
sick

1088
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:59,700
foreign

1089
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,800
you got to worry about shopping cart

1090
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,119
handles I've always done that my whole

1091
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,560
life you got to worry about shopping

1092
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,359
cart handles

1093
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,040
you got to clean a shopping cart handle

1094
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:10,200
definitely with a handy wipe there's no

1095
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:13,099
question this is long before covet

1096
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,099
pre-all that

1097
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,880
it's also important to stay aware when

1098
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,980
handling objects we just brought into

1099
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,200
our homes okay

1100
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,180
I understand if you can do this if this

1101
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,880
isn't an option

1102
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,260
it just be fine but I want to read this

1103
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,819
one thing about packages it's

1104
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,220
interesting

1105
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:34,680
okay packages can be a huge source of

1106
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:37,560
transmission like the flu or covid or

1107
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:40,200
strep or MRSA okay especially when

1108
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,359
you're setting down packages so what I

1109
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,280
do is when I get a new package that

1110
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,839
comes there's a delivery a medical

1111
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,000
medium book

1112
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,460
right I don't take the package and throw

1113
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,200
it on my kitchen counter you can but

1114
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,000
just remember when you put that package

1115
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,560
on the kitchen counter you probably want

1116
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,140
to wipe off that kitchen counter space

1117
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,220
because these packages have grease

1118
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,980
underneath them and all kinds of

1119
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,859
pathogens and stuff like that

1120
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,660
foreign

1121
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:08,940
says I've had around 10 Dental visits

1122
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:11,700
during last year and after the last one

1123
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,920
I did the brain shots and this was the

1124
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,680
only time I didn't feel bad or sick

1125
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,020
after the visit definitely doing this

1126
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,359
again we're doing it now with this shot

1127
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,520
we are together

1128
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:26,400
putting that shot together I'm gonna do

1129
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,720
it in a couple seconds with you guys

1130
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,000
okay

1131
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:33,619
you might not want to set packages that

1132
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,800
just came in from UPS FedEx whatever the

1133
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:41,119
UPS wherever it is USPS or wherever or

1134
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:44,099
around the country around the world

1135
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,300
you don't want to set the packages on a

1136
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,339
cutting board

1137
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,500
so my cutting board right here like I

1138
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:51,540
won't put a package that just came in

1139
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,020
the mail I won't just put it on my

1140
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,020
cutting board

1141
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,220
or my kitchen counter placing a new

1142
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,619
package on a crib I've seen people they

1143
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,119
place it on a crib or on a bed or a

1144
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,980
couch I'm like well I wouldn't do it

1145
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,260
that that way either

1146
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,880
and then grabbing the package and then

1147
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,500
you're rubbing your eye you know after

1148
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,940
you grab the package you're rubbing your

1149
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,680
eye

1150
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,240
sure enough it's there's a good chance

1151
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,900
nothing's gonna happen but what if it's

1152
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,900
at one time

1153
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,359
you know you're fixing your eye makeup

1154
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,280
or you're moving your hair constantly

1155
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:25,560
while in the middle of opening a package

1156
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,060
wash your hands after handling packages

1157
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,880
what I'm saying is when you get packages

1158
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,040
fresh off you know like you just ordered

1159
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,599
something and it came and you grabbed

1160
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,220
your package and brought it in put it in

1161
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,440
a spot where you don't think it's going

1162
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,040
to be a you know a big exposure spot

1163
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,380
like your cutting board or your bed

1164
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,180
don't put the package on your bed put it

1165
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,500
somewhere right and then wash your hands

1166
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,500
after you've opened up the package

1167
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,880
it's just it's good

1168
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,619
find a designated area for your packages

1169
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,260
that isn't a high exposure spot in your

1170
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,579
home if you are not in a rush to open it

1171
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,140
wait a day

1172
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,280
unless it's a medical medium book then

1173
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,280
wash your hands up here

1174
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,440
a practice I call decanting the practice

1175
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,640
you like wine decanting the wine

1176
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,859
decanting the package

1177
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:17,400
because packages can have people's mucus

1178
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:19,380
and saliva the man especially during flu

1179
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,319
season whoa

1180
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,780
traces a fecal matter skin flakes or any

1181
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,500
other bodily fluid fluids can be on the

1182
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:32,040
packages if you like if they did DNA

1183
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:35,280
testing on your packages when they come

1184
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:38,700
in the mail or whatever delivery they

1185
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,560
did DNA testing on there

1186
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,460
they got to find DNA of all kinds of

1187
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,339
stuff

1188
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:46,740
Amanda says yes I had a client of mine

1189
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:48,780
who worked for UPS delivery drivers pee

1190
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,040
in jars in the car no bathroom breaks

1191
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,740
the reason why they pee and I'm not

1192
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:56,220
blaming them for peeing in the car in

1193
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,500
the jar but it's true I've seen that out

1194
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,720
there too now I'm not blaming anybody

1195
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,640
for that because I get it if you're

1196
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,180
trying to get packages done

1197
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:09,440
it's holidays and you gotta pee

1198
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,440
you're gonna pull out a jar

1199
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,099
if you give a package three to five days

1200
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,660
if you can't in your designated area

1201
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:17,099
there will be lesser chance of being

1202
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,660
exposed you know I mean you could

1203
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,400
whatever

1204
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,500
but wash your hands afterwards whatever

1205
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,300
if you do open your package

1206
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,520
so know that and take precursive

1207
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,380
precautions with your packages learn

1208
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,740
this information

1209
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:34,319
here's the question right here

1210
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:36,119
DYI Health says

1211
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:39,540
okay

1212
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:42,180
Simone and yet getting or sorry Simone

1213
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,640
and yet people are getting sick he's

1214
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,579
advising that we are aware

1215
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,040
while we're there asking the hygienist

1216
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:53,300
not to touch other things while they are

1217
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,300
working in your mouth yeah

1218
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,900
beyond all of this awareness about

1219
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,240
exposures and sources you could limit

1220
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:03,660
the damage a virus can do by making your

1221
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:06,000
body an inhospitable place for viruses

1222
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,559
how you can limit the other brain

1223
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,960
betrayers in your life I talked about

1224
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:12,000

00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,400
anyway

1227
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:19,800
and there's a quote at the bottom

1228
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,880
there is a greater truth Underneath It

1229
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,400
All

1230
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,339

1300
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,400
so

1301
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,079
these cleanses are imperative for what's

1302
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,200
to come in this world oh but I'm not

1303
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,200
allowed

1304
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,520
don't talk about germs

1305
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:40,440
I'm just putting germ fear out there now

1306
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,280

1307
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,740

1309
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,900

00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:51,240
who cares it makes you stronger

1311
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,520

sarcastic right these cleanses are

1313
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,119
imperative for what's to come in this

1314
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,160
world the onslaught of domestic chemical

1315
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,500

college

1324
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,619
they bomb

1325
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,599
the dorms

1326
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:29,599

1327
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:32,700
rodenticides pesticides everything

1331
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,960
unbelievable level of insecticide

1332
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,700
when you send your kid off to school

1333
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,260
right

1334
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,059
and these things get collected

1335
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,040
throughout the years when you embark on

1336
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,839
these cleanse options you're using your

1337
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,640
free will and your intention to clean

1338
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:58,859
and protect the organ that Harbors the

1339
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,780
knowledge of the past present and soon

1340
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:02,460
to be future of your life which is your

1341
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,680
brain

1342
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:09,140
and guess what your brain Harbors your

1343
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,140
soul too and that's important to know

1344
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,579
it Harbors your soul

1345
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,079
we're not allowed to know that too

1346
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,480
is your information police here

1347
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,480
don't say that either

1348
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,460
Enlightenment is not about being

1349
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,400
all-knowing

1350
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:38,099
Enlightenment is the freedom to be at

1351
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:42,300
peace because you have full control over

1352
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:43,980
what resides inside your brain

1353
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,559
enlightenment

1354
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:48,599
is not just about all knowing that's not

1355
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,800
the answer Enlightenment is about having

1356
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,119
control

1357
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,119
and empowerment

1358
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:57,000
since we don't have control about what

1359
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,500
resides around us in the world because

1360
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,960
you can't control the world you have

1361
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:03,260
control about how you can protect

1362
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,260
yourself

all right let's do this

1427
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:04,079
this is the mm 1500 it's on sale right

1428
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,780
now I call it the medicine machine the

1429
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,180
medicine maker okay

1430
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:11,460
get the mm-900 too

1431
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:15,299
they have high compression

1432
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:17,700
I endorsed these machines for a reason

1433
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:20,780
because they're incredible they're cold

1434
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:24,480
pressed masticating juicers

1435
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,799
preserving nutrients but these squeeze

1436
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,319
out

1437
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:29,099
everything they can and that saves you

1438
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,220
money

1439
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:34,980
food costs are rising

1440
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:37,920
and Rising no matter what you're eating

1441
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,299
doesn't matter if it's processed food or

1442
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,579
a vegetable

1443
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:44,040
food costs are rising

1444
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:46,140
right but when you're using a medicine

1445
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,059
machine that's saving you money so it

1446
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,280
pays for itself

1447
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:51,780
it's incredible

1448
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,780
it's because juicers don't squeeze

1449
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:58,079
enough juice out and then after two

1450
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:01,559
years most juicers when they break down

1451
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:03,960
you can't get parts replaced 15-year

1452
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,540
warranty on the 900 and the 1500

1453
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:11,040

01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:13,020
see a mega mm-1500 Omega mm-900

just want you to know because people ask

1456
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,980
every day and it makes me want to scream

1457
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:19,319

1464
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:37,020

1473
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,920
two sprigs of Rosemary

1474
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:18,119
this is a serious serious exposure shot

1475
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:20,579
aw in Europe they have trouble sourcing

1476
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:23,700
green asparagus Depending on time of

1477
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:26,040
year his white asparagus okay to use for

1478
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,319

1479
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:30,780
don't know if I put white asparagus in

1480
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:33,200

1482
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,200
and maybe I did put it in there I don't

1483
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:43,380
know I just put Garlic in there so I put

1484
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,599
thyme I put Rosemary I put Garlic in

1485
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,819
there now I'm putting in asparagus next

1486
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,319
now these are small

1487
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:52,140
these ones so I'm going to put in

1488
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:56,660
probably more than two this is two raw

1489
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,660
medium asparagus Spears right

1490
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,619
but these are like small so I'm gonna

1491
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,619
pop in

1492
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,740
a couple more they're like really tiny

1493
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,960
and dried out

1494
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,119
all right

1495
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:14,400
next one is two raw brussels sprouts

1496
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:16,260
really tiny brussels sprouts I've been

1497
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,299
having a hard time getting the big ones

1498
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,900
so I'm probably gonna pop in a little

1499
01:03:18,299 --> 01:03:23,460
bit like that's one right there

1500
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,440
so I'm gonna have to put in four of

1501
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,440
these because two of them are equal

1502
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:32,099
one more

1503
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:33,660
because they got brussels sprouts in it

1504
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:36,660
like this

1505
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:39,540
these are like that all right

1506
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:42,540
one or two stalks of celery

1507
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:44,960
uh one it's a one to two stalks of

1508
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,960
celery

1509
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:50,359
right

1510
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,359
I'm gonna put two

1511
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:57,260
pathogen exposure shot is one of my

1512
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,260
favorite

1513
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,500
it really is

1514
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,559
okay here we go

1515
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,460
Valerie says I always have frozen

1516
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,559
asparagus in my freezer can I defrost

1517
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:15,960
them and use them

1518
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:18,059
yes you can

1519
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,020
I had to wait for that answer from

1520
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:21,020
Spirit of compassion

1521
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,180
by the way when you ask a question

1522
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,819
guess who's talking to me

1523
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:32,839
Spirit of compassion

1524
01:04:29,819 --> 01:04:32,839
that's how it works

1525
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:41,480
all right shutting this down

1526
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:47,460
by the way with this juicer

1527
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,380
when the pulp does come out

1528
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,299
this is so dry this time it's like

1529
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,700
coming out like dust

1530
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:55,920
and that's where the money saved is at

1531
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,079
which is incredible

1532
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,839
it's not like the spinning basket ones

1533
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,839
or the centrifuges and all those

1534
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:05,880
they just they just Scorch the juice

1535
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,160
because it's scorching literally

1536
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,299
scorching it's brutalizing it's not cold

1537
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,640
pressed

1538
01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:14,480
and on top of it

1539
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:17,040
it's incredible how dry this comes out

1540
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,660
it's unbelievable so the amount of juice

1541
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,520
that's saved I think is in the profile

1542
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:22,680
link is the description on the mm-900

1543
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:24,780
and the mm-1500

1544
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:27,859

1545
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,859
let me get a shot glass

1546
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:33,740
