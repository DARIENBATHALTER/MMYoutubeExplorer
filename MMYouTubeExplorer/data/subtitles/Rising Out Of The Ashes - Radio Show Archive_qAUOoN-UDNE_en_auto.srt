00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,320

51
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,879
information on the medical Medium show

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,400
right there hasn't gone through process

53
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,319
processing hasn't been turned into a

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,640

a blueberry muffin with fake blueberries

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,560
in there hasn't been processed and

59
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,040
altered and the information here is 10

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,239
20 years ahead of what's out there now

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
and I mean that and life is precious and

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,120
there's no time to spare because you

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,319
don't have 10 years to wait for answers

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
unless you do unless you think you got

65
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,840
10 more years 15 more years meaning just

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,480
to wait around for answers I mean I

67
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,680
don't have that there's no way I need

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,519
the spirit I need the spirit information

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,879
now you guys need it now and you know

70
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,319
what I'm seeing out there right now

71
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,159
which is really disheartening I got to

72
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,560
tell you I would have thought by now

73
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,319
2016 I would have thought by now at 2016

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,440
where we are today we still weren't

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,799
going to be

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,239
recycling uh nonsense information that's

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,920
been around for 30 years 20 years the

78
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,519
same information but

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,480
recycling back into brand new literature

80
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,360
and selling it with a bow on it I never

81
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,920
thought that would happen it just makes

82
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,239
no sense and it tells me something it

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,080
tells me why we're still backwards and

84
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,040
why we're still not healing and why

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,319
we're still where we are today without

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,519
getting the answers and it just tells me

87
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,159
and and know I'm like okay okay you know

88
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,840

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,879
through stuff we go through struggles we

99
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,519

the mood for getting a light blast to

183
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,680
ignite the healing and that light blast

184
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,080
that I talk about that started when I

185
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,879
was a child because what happened was

186
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,919
back a long time ago there wasn't a lot

187
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,120
of options for people to heal what I

188
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,199
mean by that is the grocery store had

189
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,520
nothing in it I'm going to be honest the

190
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,479
grocery store had nothing in it and I'm

191
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,680
sure you know there's there's people

192
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,080
that are listening you guys are

193
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,560
listening people out there that remember

194
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,639
that you go around your Corner

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,199
Supermarket and there was iceberg

196
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,479
lettuce okay and if you're lucky some

197
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,720
broccoli so I'm not going to be

198
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,199
completely completely saying there's

199
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,240
nothing in there but there was some

200
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,240
broccoli okay there was yes there was

201
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,759
some iceberg lettuce at least in my

202
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,720
store that's what we had and we had some

203
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,120
apples and some oranges okay those were

204
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,039
there and we had some bananas so I'm not

205
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,759
saying there wasn't some food but it was

206
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,199
really Bleak there wasn't cilantro there

207
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,960
wasn't you know berock rote okay there

208
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,479
wasn't Alo there wasn't just not even

209
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,159
just that there weren't even radishes

210
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,560
not in my neck of the woods back a long

211
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,319
long time ago there weren't the food for

212
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,479
healing and guess what the supplements

213
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,279
there weren't supplements they barely

214
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,719
existed at best they were really

215
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,039
gruesome I mean it was really gruesome

216
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,519
it was the Dark Ages back then so

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,320
options for people to heal weren't that

218
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,360
easy for people I remember when I was

219
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,279
about 13 years old and I was talking to

220
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,320
a client on the phone yes a client on

221
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,440
the phone at age 13 and in another state

222
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,399
and it was so Bleak yeah they had had

223
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
potatoes and they had iceberg lettuce

224
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,519
it's the two things they had and you

225
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,440
know for for medicinal Foods is what I'm

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,760
saying and I remember saying to Spirit

227
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,279
is there something else I can do is

228
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,279
there something else we can do because

229
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,760
they can't get they were in Idaho they

230
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,760
can't get anything but those two things

231
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,320
and no supplementation really when it

232
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,279
was in the dead of winter there was no

233
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,480
there was no foraging for wild food

234
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,640
because that's the first thing Spirit

235
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
would have said is we're going to look

236
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,360
for wild food for them that's what we're

237
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,399
going to do so there were a couple of

238
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,720
tees I remember that so I said to Spirit

239
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
what can we get and I and I asked the

240
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,279
people you know can you find this tea do

241
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,200
you know who could have this tea and

242
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,399
they had to go and just basically rans

243
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,360
sack an entire town for a little bit of

244
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,839
an herbal tea that's how bad it was so I

245
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,480
said to Spirit what do I do what do I do

246
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,279
we're not there yet and spirit said to

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
me there's going to in the future we're

248
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,720
going to have we're going to be packed

249
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,279
with different foods in the grocery

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
stores including even wild Foods in the

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,560
grocery stores to help us and I said

252
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,480
well you know what you know I I know

253
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,720
that but that's decades from now decades

254
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,880
from Spirit said there's going to be

255
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,800
supplements in the future too lots of

256
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,079
different supplements from Geniuses

257
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Geniuses and Alternative Health I'm not

258
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,079
talking about the cookie cutter crap you

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,600
know the the the the conventional um

260
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,920
nutritional supplement that's just

261
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,480
garbage that I see on TV every day and I

262
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,240
look at it you know when I whenever I

263
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,440
get a chance and I watch TV for a couple

264
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,880
minutes or I see a commercial somewhere

265
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,079
when I'm over a family member's house

266
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,839
and they got the TV on all the time is

267
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,959
that's usually when I'll see it is going

268
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
over a family member's house and when I

269
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:43,600
look and I see a commercial come on and

270
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,279
it's for a junk junk junk fish oil like

271
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,880
something that's just not even a good

272
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,360
fish oil and you guys know how I stand

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,839
about fish oil where it's not really

274
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,279
good and or I see some kind of

275
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,079
conventional supplement and I'm not

276
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,240
talking about even those I mean I'm

277
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,360
talking about right now in this day we

278
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,399
have all kinds of ingenious supplements

279
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,040
coming from incredible places I

280
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
recommend them on my site uh all the

281
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,959
time um I don't sell them on there but

282
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,800
if you if you go to Medical mean.com

283
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
you'll see I have the supplement

284
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,839
registry it's a supplement kind of

285
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,519
directory of the best stuff from genius

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,320
people out there and that didn't exist

287
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,160
back then that didn't that did not exist

288
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,040
and I said to Spirit what do we do and

289
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,480
spirit says let's do the light

290
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
blast and and I said okay I like the

291
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,920
light blast and spirit showed me the

292
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,800
light blast you know even even a couple

293
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,800
years before then when I was even

294
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,320
younger and spirit had to remind let's

295
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,279
do the light blast again okay I'm ready

296
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,079
and then I would help and get that light

297
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,279
blast of the person Spirit would send

298
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,440
light from above down hitting the crown

299
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,399
of the person rushing through their body

300
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,240
and igniting their healing process and

301
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,200
that's what we do at the events and that

302
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,880
I don't care what it takes and I said

303
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,800
this before in some of the other shows I

304
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,959
don't care after that light blast that

305
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm like a jellyfish on the ground okay

306
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,600
that I've been that I've been literally

307
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,200
neutralized and I'm on the ground like a

308
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,399
like a pull of sweat I make sure

309
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,320
everybody gets that blast of light and

310
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,079
then then I recharge later it's it's

311
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,760
it's it's fine you I don't want you guys

312
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,199
scared by it but I make sure that light

313
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,399
blast runs through everybody and starts

314
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,920
to ignite the healing process remove

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,880
start removing some old injuries some

316
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,760
Old Wounds we have hundreds and hundreds

317
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,720
of people that have had benefits coming

318
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,000
out of that and and and I and I still

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm still willing to do it while I'm

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,120
here while I'm alive and breathing I'm

321
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,720
still willing to do it and that's just

322
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,360
the bottom line and I'm going to going

323
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,760
to keep on trying to do it so hey so

324
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,519
that's at the event we do the light

325
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,880
blast also we talk about things that we

326
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,399
don't talk about anywhere not even not

327
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,320
even here on the radio show and we do

328
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,800
the live readings right on right on

329
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,199
stage so right there spirit's with me by

330
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,839
my side never lets me down and and tells

331
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:04,560
me what's going on with someone so check

332
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,639

335
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,440
to get into the show if this is your

336
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,399
first time here today it all started for

337
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,800
me at age four and I heard Spirit a

338
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:23,000
voice perfectly clear perfectly clear in

339
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,560
my right ear without anything in the way

340
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,839
just right there from the outside just

341
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,959
hearing spirit I went to my window and

342
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,880
looked out there thinking there was a

343
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:33,720
radio playing and there was nothing

344
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,560
going on there was nobody out there I

345
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,360
went

346
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,440
downstairs and saw my family and try to

347
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,279
shake it off and it would not shake off

348
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,399
that

349
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,199
evening sitting at the dinner table

350
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,000
Spirit appeared for the first of two

351
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,399
times Spirit has ever shown itself to me

352
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,079
so I hear spirit all the time in my ear

353
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,279
but this the first of two times that

354
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,000
I've ever seen Spirit ever

355
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,079
standing behind my

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,480
grandmother standing there and I was

357
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,959
sitting in my chair at the dinner table

358
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,600
and Spirits it spirit said to me and

359
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,360
waved me over and said come over and I

360
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,199
got out of my chair and I walked over to

361
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,680
my grandmother and he said pronounce

362
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,720
grandma has lung

363
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,320
cancer and I did after a couple of times

364
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,800
to get the words out just right and

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,880
later on we found out she did because we

366
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,560
had to take her in because a 4-year-old

367
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,040
just said Grandma has lung cancer and so

368
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,360
it all started there and I've dedicated

369
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,839
my life helping people helping tens of

370
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,519
thousands of people get answers and

371
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,759
that's what this show is about you guys

372
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,639
it's about getting the answers so that

373
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,199
we can move forward and heal and that's

374
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,800
what it's about so let's let's talk

375
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,600
about let's talk about rising out of the

376
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,600
ashes what does that mean what does that

377
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,279
mean well you know about the whole

378
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,959
Phoenix thing of course you know you got

379
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,320
the whole Phoenix thing and that's yeah

380
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,600
that that's that's a whole part of it

381
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
but we're not we're not talking about

382
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,040
that part of it we're talking we're

383
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,560
talking about the part of it about you

384
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,399
know literally when just everything

385
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,759
burns down on us that's what it feels

386
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,199
like and I'm not talking about Mercury

387
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,240
retrograde stuff where things get a

388
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:18,160
little hard I'm talking about when we're

389
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,680
we're struggling we're trying to push

390
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,959
through we're dealing with problems

391
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,639
we're dealing with sickness we're

392
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,959
dealing with illness we got all kinds of

393
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,240
different things going on in our life

394
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:32,800
and we and we have to get through

395
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:37,399
somehow you know spirit said to me

396
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,880
spirit said to me okay spirit said to me

397
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,440
all all storms

398
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:47,560
pass okay all storms pass and it is

399
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:51,360
sunny on the other side nothing stays

400
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,639
the same and all things change one thing

401
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,079
that people have told me over the years

402
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,560
has theyve been sick so long or not

403
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,240
feeling good so long or they've been

404
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,399
having a string long string of B bad

405
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,120
luck and they say to me it's not going

406
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,560
to

407
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,440
change it can't change it's been going

408
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,600
on too long and that's what they say to

409
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,920
me and it breaks my heart to hear that

410
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,279
to hear that come out of somebody's

411
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,040
mouth and I respect it I honor

412
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,240
it but one thing that like I said Spirit

413
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,759
has told me is nothing stays the same

414
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,600
and all things change no matter what so

415
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,680
nothing stays the same so if you've been

416
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,959
sick for a long time it's not going to

417
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,040
stay that

418
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:43,519
way it's going to change you have to

419
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,160
know that this is so important because

420
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,920
if you're in a storm and that Storm's a

421
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,639
long time and you've been experiencing

422
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,079
that storm for a long time and not well

423
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,440
and you're unwell and you've been sick

424
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,160
and not feeling good and you've been

425
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,040
experiencing that storm for a long time

426
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,279
it's not going to stay the same

427
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,199
it's not it's going to change and the

428
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,520
blue sky is going to come and the Sun is

429
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:11,959
going to come out so you need to know

430
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,640
that whether it's small whether it's big

431
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,480
whether it's something small where you

432
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,520
just have some symptoms you're dealing

433
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,559
with okay and the symptoms are doing

434
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,039
weird things and you're not sure what

435
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,240
they are cuz you've been to every doctor

436
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,079
and you've been searching and you don't

437
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,959
have answers but you have answers but

438
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,840
they're really not real answers but

439
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,320
you're looking for more

440
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,160
answers and it's you know it's not so

441
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,919
bad because you look

442
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
fine on the outside or maybe it's bad

443
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,720
and you still look fine on the outside

444
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,480

451
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,679
conditions and people on the outside

452
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,520
they think you look fine like there's

461
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,000
like you look good you look good I mean

462
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,000
and that's really hard right there and

463
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,280
then people you know people are kind of

464
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,840
tired of hearing about it too did you

465
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,200
ever run into that I run I I hear about

466
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,600
that all the time then people are you

467
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,159
know they're tired they're they don't

468
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,840
want to hear it anymore they don't want

469
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,640
to here oh that's right yeah you're sick

470
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,720
well you look okay oh but that's right

471
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,080
you're tired um yeah I forgot you I you

472
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,039
know or I know I heard it a million

473
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,159
times and so we have to we have to hold

474
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,360
on to these things when we shouldn't

475
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,200
have to hold on to them but we have to

476
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
we have to be quiet about them sometimes

477
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,280
you guys ever you've ever run into that

478
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,120
because I talk to people and then I've

479
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,400
seen it happen and I've seen people go

480
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,159
through that and it's really hard but if

481
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,200
you're not feeling well and you've been

482
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:02,840
through something and you're going

483
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,640
through something like that it can

484
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,960
change it can change there's no question

485
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,880
about it it can change and you can move

486
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:18,520
forward so all storms pass Spirit told

487
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:21,760
me nothing stays the same and all things

488
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:25,000
change you got to remember that because

489
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,320
when you know that it helps make it

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,200
happen it helps make it happen faster

491
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,760
and

492
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,600
sooner and it helps build up the spirit

493
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,760
it helps build up your spirit okay so

494
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,200
it's something I wanted to tell you so

495
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,600
rising out of the

496
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:47,640
ashes you know if anyone who's ever been

497
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,480
sick or has been sick too long they

498
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,919
could get to a point of saying something

499
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,640
and I was kind of talking about this a

500
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,159
little bit they get to the point where

501
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,240
they're like can I heal that's what they

502
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:04,240
say is it possible to

503
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:07,600
heal is it ever going to happen can I

504
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,400
heal because when you've been sick too

505
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,000
long and you get and you're going

506
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,840
through it too long you lose even the

507
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,600
the feeling that you can heal you lose

508
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,600
it I've seen people lose it after 6

509
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,840
months so they get sick with something

510
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,559
they're going to doctor they're going to

511
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,880
the doctor medical clinics you know here

512
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,679
across the country famous medical

513
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,360
clinics um you know the whole

514
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,200
which are just starting to get just you

515
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,640
know a little bit of new information on

516
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,520
health a little bit but they but they're

517
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,240
not there yet so you go to all the fancy

518
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,760
medical clinics that still think the

519
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,360
body's attacking itself they still think

520
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,000
autoimmune is the body attacking itself

521
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,080
so this is if this is your first show

522
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,440
and you've haven't you know read any of

523
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,840
the books or anything else like that and

524
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,200
or looked into um our information the

525
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,440
body doesn't attack itself and

526
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,880
autoimmune is a great mistake and um we

527
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,039
talk about it more and more so you're

528
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,440
going to have to tune into some of that

529
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
so you know when when we're when we're

530
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,200
going around and we're looking for help

531
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,559
and even after 6 months we can get to

532
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,360
the point where I can't heal I I just

533
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,840
can't or can I is it even possible

534
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,080
anymore and all the doubts file in and

535
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,760
then there's some people that are like

536
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,400
okay no no and they got a little bit of

537
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,360
jevity in this and they just they fight

538
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,279
they got a little bit more fight and

539
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,559
they go for another year of looking

540
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:26,760
around and they're still not feeling

541
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,200
well and they go for two years then they

542
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,440
get their Lyme disease diagnosis and

543
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,400
then they don't get their Lyme disease

544
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,440
diagnosis and then nothing seems right

545
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,120
and they never got bit by a tick or

546
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,000
whatever it is and then you know or they

547
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,520
get their Ms diagnosis or they get no

548
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,240
diagnosis and they're still tired or

549
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:44,120
they get told it's all in their head and

550
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,360
they're creating it whatever it is you

551
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,039
know it can last and it can go on a

552
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,039
little bit and and eventually we get hit

553
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:56,640
with I I don't even know if I could heal

554
00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:00,200
anymore and and that's that happens to

555
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,720
so many people and I'm sure you guys

know that if you were feeling good at

568
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,960
one time in your life this is for

569
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
anybody who's sick this is for anybody

570
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,400
who's not feeling good this is for

571
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,520
anybody who's struggling with hardships

572
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,039
even if it's not sickness or disease or

573
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,559
illness or

574
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,960
symptoms if you were in a better place

575
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:47,600
before in your

576
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,840
life whether that be at the beginning of

577
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,159
your life whether it be in the earlier

578
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,400
part or in a different part of your life

579
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:59,120
and you were feeling good and you were

580
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,400
well okay and you you felt great before

581
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,039
you got

582
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,320
sick you got to go back to that in your

583
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,520
mind you got to go back to that in your

584
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,480
memory or if it was before you had all

585
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,640
these trials and these you know these

586
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,640
hardships and struggles that are that

587
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,000
are not even sickness in your own life

588
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,840
but there's something else in your

589
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,840
family's life or something else around

590
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,159
you or whatever it might be whatever

591
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,960
kind of

592
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,520
struggle if you weren't in that position

593
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,840
at one time of your life you got to go

594
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,440
back to that and you got to be thinking

595
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,679
this is where present moment moment does

596
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,799
not help us

597
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,640
whatsoever this is where present moment

598
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,039
the whole present moment concept sh is

599
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,600
shattered being in the present moment

600
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,919
because because one thing Spirit told me

601
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,400
that if you're in the present moment

602
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,559
when you're really

603
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,720
sick then you're just going to be in

604
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:50,960
your present moment of being so sick and

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,640
if you're in the present moment of your

606
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
hardship you're going to be in the

607
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,200
present moment of your hardship this is

608
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,360
where looking into the future and

609
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,960
looking into the past past can save your

610
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,200
life and Present Moment present moment

611
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,720
doesn't now I believe in living in the

612
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,880
present moment I do I'm not I'm not you

613
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,039
know I'm not anti- presentes moment

614
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,960
believing um that's not it at all it's

615
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,080
just that present moment the whole

616
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,960
concept of present moment the whole

617
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,799
entire movement of the present moment

618
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,039
and the spiritual movement of it is for

619
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
people that aren't sick that's for

620
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,919
people that are healthy and fine and got

621
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,880
a lot of good things in their life and

622
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,559
they're just not they're just not being

623
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,080
the present moment during it

624
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:35,200
all and so that's what that's for okay

625
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,919
I'm just going to be honest but when you

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,000
of struggles if you got all kinds of

632
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,279
struggles and you're sick and you're

633
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,880
going through Hellen back yeah I said it

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,679
hell and back you know you're going

635
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,799

637
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,480

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,600
does is put you right okay I'm okay yeah

639
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,200
I'm sick I know it I'm in I'm you know

640
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,120
being in the present moment how do I

641
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,039
enjoy this moment when I'm suffering how

642
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,039
do I enjoy this present moment when I

643
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:13,720
see someone suffering like they do how

644
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,080
do I enjoy this present moment when I'm

645
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,000
going through Hellen back with some kind

646
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:23,039
of trial that may not even be a

647
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,360
sickness and what what matters then when

648
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,679
you're in that position is you have to

649
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,000
go in the

650
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,919
past if you have to live in the past you

651
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,760
live in the past for a little

652
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,200
bit and that means if you were feeling

653
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,640
good and you weren't in a struggle or

654
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,320
you weren't in a trial and you weren't

655
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,960
in a battle and that was in the past and

656
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,399
you had freedom for that moment like

657
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,279
really good

658
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:46,039
Freedom that you feel like you might

659
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,159
have lost of being sick you got to go

660
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,120
back there in your mind you got to get

661
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,720
that sensation you got to touch it you

662
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,240
got to feel it because you own that

663
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,559
sensation it's

664
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:59,480
yours and you can't let the present

665
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,960
moment concept take that away from you

666
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,679
and then when you're better and you

667
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,279
recover and you get past it all you can

668
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:05,760
be in the present moment meaning you can

669
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,240
you can utilize the present moment of

670
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,720
what it has to offer but right now you

671
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:13,399
need to use what the past has to offer

672
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,880
that is critical I've seen it save lives

673
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:16,919
because when you're sick for 10 years

674
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,080
like you guys know you're feeling you

675
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,880
know not good you've been through so

676
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,919
much and you knew there was a time when

677
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,279
you were at your best feeling at your

678
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:30,200
best not sick and you were healthy you

679
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,960
got grab on to that you got to grab on

680
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,640
to that you got to go back there and say

681
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,440
I was healthy that means I still am

682
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,600
somewhere inside of me healthy you get

683
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,720
where I'm going with this now you got to

684
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:46,679
tap into the

685
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:50,799
past to realize Health still resides in

686
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:55,679
you somewhere you're not entirely

687
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,320
sick okay that you can get better it is

688
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,200
real inside of you what you have in you

689
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,399
cuz you were feeling good you had it

690
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
going on you were feeling great you're

691
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:06,399
living your life you were doing this or

692
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,919
you were going through school or you

693
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,760
were working or whatever it is and maybe

694
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,760
you didn't feel the 100% grip but you

695
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,840
felt good enough to function whatever it

696
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,520
is and that that was in your past better

697
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,399
grab on to that because that tells you

698
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,960
you got Health inside of you now in the

699
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,960
present you got Health inside of you now

700
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,760
in the present that you're you know that

701
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,320
you got attack

702
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,880
into and also it brings you back when

703
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,960
you go back to the past of that when you

704
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,360
go back to the past of

705
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:43,600
that you're you're capturing that you're

706
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,159
basically planting seeds instantly by

707
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,399
pulling from what you had in the past a

708
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,840
garden you grew a long time ago forget

709
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,640
the present moment Garden forget that

710
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,440
one right now you want to go to the past

711
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,600
and you want to pluck things out of that

712
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Garden you want to pull fruits and

713
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,159
vegetables out of that Garden from the

714
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,679
past that's going to ignite something

future so we got to forget the present

739
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,240
moment when we go through Tri trials and

740
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,399
we go through hardships and we go

741
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,200
through struggles we got to we got to

742
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,600
dump it just push that aside just just

743
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:29,600

744
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,519
the past you strengthen your spirit and

745
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,559
you build up your soul with from Gardens

746
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,039
you planted in your

747
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,679
past those fruits and vegetables those

748
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:43,679
herbs you planted those flowers you

749
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,480
planted in the past and that reminds me

750
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,960
I had one person one client say to me a

751
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,760
long time ago they said you know what

752
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,640
thank God you told me this I said why

753
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,120
and she said because I planted a lot of

754
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,960
flowers a lot of flowers in the the past

755
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,279
when I used to feel good and I could get

756
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,279
in my garden and I could dig and I could

757
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:07,880
plant bulbs and different flowers and

758
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,640
annuals and perennials and all this kind

759
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,760
of thing and I remember doing that and

760
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,679
getting in the dirt and I love my flower

761
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,880
garden I would put you know all the

762
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,159
different mulch down around my flowers

763
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,799
and then I would go out there with the

764
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,320
hose and I would water it with the

765
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,640
hose and she said

766
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,559
Anthony I've been sitting here trying to

767
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,640
meditate in the present moment sick as a

768
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,159
dog knowing I'm

769
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,679
suffering and you just you just brought

770
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,880
back something that I had in my life

771
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,880
that I've been latching on to now and

772
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,519
I'm nurturing now in the past and

773
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,840

774
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,960

776
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,600
to think about your future too and she

777
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,799
goes but the future isn't the present

778
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,880
moment you can't we can't we're not

779
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:57,000

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,360
no no no no no no no no no no no no

781
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,799

00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,919
present moment that you have that are

783
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,600
good that we can hold on to it's not all

784
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,919

there are things there are things that

786
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,279

eating the food we need there are things

791
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,279
in the present moment I'm going to talk

792
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,799
about in a minute I'm just trying to

793
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,120
make sure you guys know the point I'm

794
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,799
trying to get

795
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,639
across and it's so serious to Healing it

796
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,679
means everything to rising out of the

797
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:28,799
ashes and you got to think about the

798
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:30,120
future right told her and she goes well

799
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,760
I don't I don't really like thinking

800
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,399
about the future too much I said well

801
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,799
what are you afraid of and she goes I'm

802
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,440
afraid of I'm not going to heal cuz I've

803
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:41,639
been sick so long I said no no no you

804
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,760
got to think about the future you got to

805
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:45,559
know you're going to heal and you're

806
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,120
going to get better because remember

807
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,519
what I said that Spirit told me one of

808
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,360
the most powerful things ever and it

809
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,799
seems simplistic and it's not a lot of

810
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,760
words but I'm going to tell you what it

811
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:58,799
is again is all storms pass and nothing

812
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,679
stays the same and all things

813
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,000
change and I and and that right there is

814
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,600
a rising out of the ashes phrase quote

815
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,919
from

816
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,279
Spirit which reminds me somebody said to

817
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,639
me well you got a lot of quotes I said I

818
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,559
don't have any quotes they're all from

819
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:20,039
Spirit they're all from Spirit I'm not

820
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,039
smart enough to come out with a

821
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,039
quote they're all from

822
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,320
Spirit okay because I get all my words

823
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,559
from Spirit sure you know exactly I'm

824
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,919
not the smartest guy then because I

825
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,120
never went to school so I'm not the

826
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:36,679
smartest guy it all comes from Spirit

827
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,679
every last bit of it I got to use from

828
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,279
Spirit spirit's the smart one spirit's

829
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,240
the one that knows everything and I told

830
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,600
you that story a long time ago you guys

831
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,559
I told you that I I had you know this

832
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,880
ego built up inside of me when I was

833
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,279
when I was in my late teens and early

834
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,279
20s because I felt Invincible because

835
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:58,880
every single thing that came from from

836
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,720
Spirit was always

837
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,840
right and I remember helping out a

838
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,480
neighbor okay and I was in the garden I

839
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,399
was pulling out onions in the garden you

840
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,080
guys know the story I know I can't help

841
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:11,679
but to tell you I was pulling onions out

842
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,880
of the garden my neighbor was came over

843
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,120
and he was standing there in the garden

844
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,000
and he said to me I don't know how you

845
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,960
do it I said what said I don't know how

846
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,399
you knew what was wrong with my wife she

847
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,320
couldn't walk for years she was in a

848
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,480
wheelchair and you knew what was wrong

849
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,279
and how to fix it and we went to every

850
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,200
doctor and every clinic and to every

851
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,200
place possible we even went overseas we

852
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,600
went to Germany we went everywhere and

853
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,679
it couldn't be fixed and she was

854
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,840
worsening and he said and I was positive

855
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,360
she was going to die I lost all hope and

856
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,159
said you knew what was wrong you knew

857
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,039
she had arsenic poisoning how did you

858
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,080
know she had arsenic poisoning it wasn't

859
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,399
even testable but you knew and you knew

860
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,279
how to get it out of her brain I said

861
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,080
and I looked up as I was holding the

862
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,159
onions and I said that's because I'm

863
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,519
never wrong never forget the I'm always

864
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,880
right I'm going to be right I'm never

865
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,919
never going to be wrong you never forget

866
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,960
it everybody else in the world never

867
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,200
forget it I'm right I'm always going to

868
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,119
be right you better believe it you

869
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,000
better know it it's the way it's going

870
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,639
to be and I'm never going to be wrong I

871
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,159
stood up cuz I was feeling Invincible

872
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,760
because Spirit since age four just you

873
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,000
know built me up pretty good I was

874
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,760
getting pretty pretty pumped up and I

875
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,720
got up and I walked over I took a few

876
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,639
steps and I Ste stepped on a rake kind

877
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,720
of like a hoe that was in the garden

878
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:33,520
stepped on it it came back at my face

879
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,240
knocked me out I was unconscious when I

880
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,520
mean unconscious I was completely gone

881
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,800
and as I was laying there on the ground

882
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,399
and I came out of it I saw my neighbor

883
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,440
standing up looking over me and then at

884
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,399
the same time spirit said to me you

885
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,359
remember this Anthony I'm the one that's

886
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,960
right you're wrong I'm the one that's

887
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:57,640
right and never forget it and so what I

888
00:34:53,960 --> 00:35:01,000
mean by that is when spirit's saying

889
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,280
all storms pass nothing stays the same

890
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,280
and all things change it's

891
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,640
true and so I was telling this client I

892
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,040
said you got to think about the future

893
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,800
what is it let's get the dream going

894
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,359
we're not going to kill the dream we're

895
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,160
going to bring it to life I want to know

896
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:22,960
where you see yourself at the

897
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,720
future I want to know and she say you

898
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,079
know what I see myself doing my flowers

899
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,480
again I see myself in the garden and

900
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,599
feeling good and my knees aren't

901
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,040
swollen and I see myself feeling better

902
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,560
I said I do too I see it

903
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,640
too and and I said you're going to take

904
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,160
what you have in the past that's yours

905
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,240
it's yours and you're going to bring it

906
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,200
in your mind now and bringing into your

907
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,920
soul now and you're going to recover

908
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,079
while you're doing your herbs and your

909
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,240
things that you need to do for your

910
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,760
health and you're doing the things

911
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,440
Spirit recommended and you're doing the

912
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,839
foods and you're doing all this great

913
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,119
stuff that Spirit recommends while

914
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,160
you're doing all of that in the present

915
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,400
moment that part's in the present moment

916
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,560
you're going to be thinking about the

917
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
past and you're going to be thinking

918
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,520
about the future and you're going to be

919
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,319
healing and she got better and she's on

920
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,520
the other side of that now in her life

921
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:19,280
she's on the other side of the storm and

922
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,359
let me tell you anybody who looked at

923
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,720
her at that time was like no no there's

924
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,440
no way no we just just she's she's she's

925
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,680
disabled there's no way she's disabled

926
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,119
she's not going anywhere that's what the

927
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,640
doctors would say that's what the

928
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,119
doctors would say that's what the

929
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,079
medical authorities also would say she's

930
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,440
not going anywhere that's it but no

931
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:45,760
she's better so it's important to

932
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,800
know you know when you're recovering and

933
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,040
you get the first sensations of

934
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,520
healing you got to hold on to those too

935
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,760
because it's a roller coaster ride for a

936
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,400
lot of people who've been sick for a

937
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,160
long time you guys it's a roller coaster

938
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,960
ride for a lot of people who have been

939
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,640
sick so if you guys have been sick or or

940
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,200

941
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,800

942
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
mean I I'm sure some of you out there

943
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,960
are like well I'm not sick I'm just

944
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,839
going through Hell

945
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,640
and Hell and everything plus and I got

946
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,560
all this stress and I got everything and

947
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,119
it hasn't changed and it's not

948
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,599
changing and um well then you know you

949
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,599
need to know you need to know when

950
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,319
something starts feeling better then no

951
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,400
matter what it is you got to hold on to

952
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,839
that even if it's for a moment that's

953
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,839
another thing I would tell people I

954
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,280
would tell people and I'm telling you

955
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,800
guys now so you start recovering and

956
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,359
you're doing your celery juice that

957
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,240
Spirit brought to us cuz celery juice

958
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,960
didn't exist prior to this and you bring

959
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,640
your celery juice

960
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,880
okay and you start drinking it you start

961
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,640
getting a little bit better and you

962
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,760
haven't you you haven't gotten a little

963
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,640
bit better yet with all the things

964
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,040
you're doing better hold on to

965
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,560
it build up that Spirit hold on to it

966
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,280
take it and use it for strength so even

967
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,280
if it takes a little time some people

968
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,000
have had Epstein Bar for a long time you

969
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
know I finally brought Epstein bar

970
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,920
information to Life For The First Time

971
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,760
in the World matching up the symptoms to

972
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,400
the illness meaning symptoms to Epstein

973
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,319
bar what symptoms cause and I see I

974
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,839
what's really amazing as I see people

975
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:26,319
actually talking about it now and

976
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,720
they're and they're saying hey look I I

977
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:31,839
heard this from Anthony William and and

978
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,000
they're just I've see just good people

979
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,520
doing that and and which is great

980
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,400
because then it could lead people to

981
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,440
getting more information also that maybe

982
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,160
someone might have forgotten or not you

983
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,560
know written down exactly so we can all

984
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,760
help together it's like we're all

985
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,560
working together as a team but then a

986
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,599
doctor friend just let me know that

987
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,839
there's a couple of people that you know

988
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,240
are taking the information kind of

989
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,680
altering it not saying where it came

990
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,280
from making it look like it's theirs and

991
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,319
the problem is with

992
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,599
that is it loses its auth authenticity

993
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,200
because it's not the the source of where

994
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,800
it came from is not being mentioned and

995
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,720
uh and that can lead people into a

996
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,560
direction that ends up just endlessly

997
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,000
just you know swimming around once again

998
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,520
back into the circle of sickness and

999
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,560
when I see that it's so disheartening

1000
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,640
it's not even funny so we got to all

1001
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,119
stay together we all got to stay strong

1002
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,079
together and we got to stay in this

1003
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,760
together and um and all heal together

1004
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,880
using spirit's information using the

1005
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,280
information that comes through so what

1006
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm telling you now if you get those

1007
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,319
sensations of healing and you had your

1008
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,440
celery juice and it's

1009
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:39,400
helping and you're doing some of the

1010
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,319
things that that we that we all talk

1011
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,880
about here on the show and on all the

1012
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,920
other shows and and you're healing

1013
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,079
remember three steps up two steps back

1014
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,760
three steps up two steps back remember

1015
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:55,040
that three steps up two steps

1016
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,240
back that's how healing

1017
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,880
works and some sometimes it takes a

1018
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,480
little longer for some people they've

1019
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,560
had a viral infection for 20 years might

1020
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,960
take take extra months to get some

1021
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,839
results and then they get the results

1022
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,079
and you hold on to that you hold on to

1023
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,640
those results what I mean by holding on

1024
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,160
to them you

1025
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,760
remember you have

1026
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,680
them

1027
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,440
because that right there is a key it's a

1028
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,000
key to healing and rising out of the

1029
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,640
ashes you hold on to that and more of

1030
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,680
it's going to come and more it's going

1031
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,839
to come even if you went two steps back

1032
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,640
then you're going to have three steps

1033
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,119
forward and more of it's going to come

1034
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,000

fasciitis

1048
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,319
neurological all of it is and they take

1049
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,760
a little time to heal all of those by

1050
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:10,440
the way are Epstein bar

they got that that small intestinal

1135
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,680
growth of overgrowth of bacteria which

1136
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,000
is still unexplainable by doctors by the

1137
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,720
way it's it's anti antibiotic resistance

1138
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,160
strep a cacus is what that is and that's

1139
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,800
from taking you know antibiotics when

1140
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,280
you're a child and and and all kinds of

1141
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,880
different stuff and later on you get a

1219
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,760

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,040
millimet where his finger slips and he

doesn't get and he doesn't have the Rope

1224
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,040
latched yet or anything like that and

1225
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,359

1226
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,880
it's

1227
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:19,160
treacherous and he's about to slip if he

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,559
had wild blueberries in him or she had

1229
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,440
wild blueberries in him could have meant

1230
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,480
the difference between slipping or not

1231
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,040

1232
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,480
