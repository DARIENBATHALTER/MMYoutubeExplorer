everybody's coming on all right so today

66
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,960
is the burnout stabilizer and the thing

67
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,600
I want to talk to you about that is

68
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,120
first of all people get diagnosed now

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,699
with burnout but it's totally

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,240
misunderstood yes you could get burnt

71
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,940
out but why how how does it work

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,440
and then it's it's a scapegoat too it's

73
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,300
like oh you're just burnt out you're

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
just weak you're not as strong as

75
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,020
somebody else

76
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,540
somebody else can handle everything

77
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,820
somebody else can do more you're just

78
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,639
weak something's wrong with you you're

79
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,759
burnt out you need a vacation you need a

80
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,100
a sabbatical you need a year off right

81
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,139
people say but it's more than that it's

82
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,660
way more than that the burnout

83
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,300
stabilizer is incredible though because

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,580
if you feel like you've been pushing

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,040
right pushing too much pushing the

86
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,720

about this they have the power to get

229
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,320
rid of a hundred symptoms

230
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,480
100 different symptoms over time

231
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,579

what they are they're actually Miracle

234
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,040
shots

235
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,779
how incredible they're designed to be

236
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,240
highly absorbable and I say this every

237
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,880
single day we do the challenge

238
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,500
instant absorption into the blood

239
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
vessels of the mouth

240
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,100
not just because they're in liquid form

241
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,100
but because of what they are

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,940
that's the key right there

243
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,220
nobody anywhere signs a research nowhere

244
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,700
anywhere do they know

245
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,740
how to come up with such a miracle

246
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,200
so this information comes from above if

247
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,720
you're new here this information comes

248
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,640
from above

249
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,220
and so with that

250
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,260
the healing power is Within These I mean

251
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,300
how many times has the man-made stuff an

252
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,880
alternative health

253
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,680

254
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,680
how many times has the man-made stuff in

255
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,079
conventional Health not helped us

256
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,260
I read a comment recently

257
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,060
and you might even be here okay who the

258
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,459
person who left this comment but I read

259
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,760
a comment recently about charcoal

260
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:56,519
they took charcoal years ago

261
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,899
I think it was like 20 years ago

262
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,640
because the doctor wanted them on

263
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,380
charcoal

264
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,980
and then they stopped it and then three

265
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,980
years later

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,180
they were getting a colonic for the

267
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,180
first time

268
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,959
and the therapist there

269
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,180
was seeing black ink coming out of their

270
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,279
colon

271
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,620
because the charcoal

272
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,459
did what I've been telling everybody it

273
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,779
does

274
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:30,120
it clings to the intestinal tract walls

275
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,640
not allowing nutrients to get in to the

276
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,920
bloodstream making somebody deficient

277
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,540
and it could stay there forever

278
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,399
and so they're getting clonic and it was

279
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,000
getting it out black ink was coming out

280
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,459

349
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,100
blown away by the information but I had

350
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,060
something that was kind of needling my

351
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,560
brain

352
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,420
this morning

353
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,160
I woke up this morning it was like five

354
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,079
o'clock in the morning or something

355
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,459
and I woke up and I thought about it and

356
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,920
I thought about like all the podcast

357
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,380
doctor guys

358
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,839
and all the other like guys and they all

359
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,480
have their big websites right

360
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,860
but they charge for everything but I

361
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
thought they were in it for people being

362
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,180
sick but it turns out really not because

363
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,560
if you're in it for the chronically ill

364
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,199
and if you're in it for The Chronic

365
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,699
allele to get answers and to heal why

366
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,800
are you charging them everything

367
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,199
everywhere why are you putting pay walls

368
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,880
up why are you charging for every course

369
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,760
in class why are you charging everything

370
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,600
if you're in it for the chronically ill

371
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:56,459
this was needling my brain at 5am

372
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
and

373
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,600
it's insane really when you think about

374
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,399
it and then when you actually pay for

375
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,260
one of their things their courses or you

376
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,060

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,179
I forgot who's saying that

410
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,500

people don't like me because I'm not

412
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,959

432
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,360
it's like okay fine but the thing is

433
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,799
people don't like me because they can

434
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,900
tell I'm not part of that club that

435
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,700
elite club that trust funder and that

436
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,799

00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:32,580
feel we did not like the mold exposure

445
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,780

00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,580
exposure shot at all

451
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,760

information in the books are not me

518
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:18,299
talking silly it's all the words from

519
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,480
above I write them down

520
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,480
foreign

521
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,299
books really smart from above

522
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,220
me not smart books really smart from

523
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,500
above

524
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,179
know that

525
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,179
me just good messenger

526
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,220
from this incredible information

527
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,960
from above to save lives

528
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,240
picture a swimming pool with the water

529
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,440
draining out you guys picture a swimming

530
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,640
pool

531
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:57,080
with the water draining out

532
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,080
or picture an ocean

533
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,860
that's draining because there's a big

534
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:04,080
hole in the middle of the ocean and it's

535
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,039
raining back into the Earth

536
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,039
that's pretty cool

537
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,120
at the same time you have water going

538
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,100
back into the swimming pool or water

539
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,140
going back into the ocean at the same

540
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,440
time but here's the problem

541
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:23,039
not as much water is flowing in than is

542
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,720
Flowing out you have more water flowing

543
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,539
out

544
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
foreign

545
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,860
flowing in so there's a problem here

546
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,260
more water's flowing out less water is

547
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,480
flowing in do you know what I'm saying I

548
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:39,000
am figuring this out with you guys right

549
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,679
we're figuring it all out less water is

550
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,500
flowing into the pool

551
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,820
or lake erosion more water is Flowing

552
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,299
out

553
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,880
so what happens the level goes down and

554
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,380
the level goes down and the level goes

555
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,580
down

556
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,980
see

557
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,980
right

558
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,960
you got water coming in but more water

559
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,460
leaving than what's water coming in and

560
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
the level's dropping now but you're

561
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:06,360
looking and you see the water coming in

562
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,340
well I got water coming into that pole

563
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,140
but for some reason that level is going

564
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,240
down because more water is leaving the

565
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,220
pool right

566
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,200
that's how it works when supplies can't

567
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,340
reach the brain faster than our brain is

568
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,820
using them up

569
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,799
our brain uses those supplies faster

570
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,140
faster than we're putting them back in

571
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,500
that's what happens

572
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,260
our brain is using those supplies faster

573
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,659
than what's going back into our brain

574
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,059
that's what's going wrong with so many

575
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:39,299
people what's going wrong with everybody

576
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:42,120
everybody has that problem right now

577
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,640
out there in the world

578
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,220
if nutrients and phytochemical compounds

579
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,740
and antiviral compounds

580
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,720
very important antibacterial compounds

chemicals leave the brain faster than we

587
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,980
put them back into the brain how can our

588
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,720
brain function optimally

589
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,159
when you just think about that right

590
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,440
there it's mind-blowing when you look at

591
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,000
these these books these brand saver

592
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,360
books and you just look at that and it's

593
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,360
just like

594
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,509
hold on you guys

595
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,509
[Music]

596
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,220
can I grow up

597
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,120
should a family member said to me very

598
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:35,720
recently said are you ever gonna grow up

599
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,720
like what

600
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,100
this is the foundation of burnout supply

601
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,380
and demand

602
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,240
supply and demand that's the foundation

603
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,760
of burnout that's what's happening to

604
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,380
everybody they're walking around and the

605
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,480
water is leaving the swimming pool

606
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,340
faster than the good Waters coming in so

607
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,960
the water's leaving

608
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,640
and the good water is coming in but it's

609
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,440
not enough water coming in you see how

610
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,419
it works and then boom we're starting to

611
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,860
get lower lower and this is what's cool

612
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,780
there's so much good information in this

613
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:06,059
chapter alone it's mind-blowing and then

614
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,220
what happens is

615
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:09,840
deficiencies and burnout have more to do

616
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,159
with each other than anybody knows get

617
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,080
ready for this

618
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,340
the conventional medical industry just

619
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,559
wants to say oh you're burnt out you

620
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,299
need a vacation

621
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,700
that's what's wrong

622
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:23,220
that's what they like to do

623
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,500
but burnout is very much real what is

624
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,179
true what it truly is and how it works

625
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,620
that's what the missing pieces are out

626
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,000
there in the industry they have no idea

627
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,100
what it is there's no medical

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,200
explanation

629
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,000
alternative medicine still believes that

630
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,860
autoimmune disease is the body attacking

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,059
itself how unbelievable is that you go

632
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,080
to your best functional medicine doctor

633
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,700

medicine doctor and they'll still

637
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
believe your immune system is attacking

638
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,860
your thyroid

639
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,179

liver and your other organs how insane

is that that's not even accurate we know

646
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,640
that with the medical medium books we

647
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,120
know that from the information above

648
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,120

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,159
burnout okay I finally got my answer

681
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,960
but she didn't get your answer

682
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,679
that's the term but you didn't get your

683
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,080
answer

684
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:26,820
Jenny Jenn says I had an MRI with

685
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,100
contrast last week that horribly

686
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,600
impacted my short-term memory I did both

687
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,700
the radiation and pharmaceutical

688
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,679
exposure shots and I have my memory back

689
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,260
brain shots are a blessing that's

690
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,419
incredible that's that's that's actually

691
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:42,000
investment to exactly them that's a

692
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,220
testament to how they work that's the

693
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,480
kind of power they have because that's a

694
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,480
serious impact you had

695
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,159
Julie says hi I'm doing these shots on

696
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:55,799
my nephew who is addicted to gambling

697
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,320
whoa and he's feeling loads better

698
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,200
sleeping and looking better incredible

699
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,820
keep them coming okay bartender give me

700
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,779
another one bartender give me another

701
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,779
one keep them coming

702
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,640
burnout is an answer that makes sense

703
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:13,320
for about 10 seconds you guys

704
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,179
because it's more than that see these

705
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,980
burnout stabilizers are addressing that

706
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,600
burnout term but there's way deeper than

707
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,460
that these burnout stabilizers are

708
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,440
incredible because they address the real

709
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,000
problems inside that's what I'm trying

710
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,860
to tell you guys that's what I'm trying

711
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,299
to say

712
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,580
the word burnout in the medical

713
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:31,980
establishment is an answer that lasts

714
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,600
for 10 seconds an hour or a day or two

715
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,340
that after that you're like what the

716
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,620
heck is wrong with me a burnout

717
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,240
diagnosis doesn't feel satisfying it's

718
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,580
not satiating

719
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,220
why am I burnt out you'll find yourself

720
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,559
asking why am I burnt out you get ready

721
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,940
how come I can't handle what someone

722
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,520
else can handle

723
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,440
see the questioning that happens think

724
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,820
about that one right there how come I

725
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,740
can't handle what everybody else can

726
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,260
handle if I'm burnt out and that's my

727
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,140
diagnosis after all those doctors what

728
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,120
am I doing wrong what am I weak

729
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,279
if you're fortunate enough to have the

730
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,039
resources to take a sabbatical or a week

731
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,700

at people it's like insane

741
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,860
Julie Greenwood says I could cry now

742
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,120

743
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,120

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,539
had a huge breakthrough with a friend

746
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:51,059
who I recommended to take the stabilizer

747
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,380
massive reduction in long-standing

748
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,820
anxiety what you guys are gonna find

749
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,620
that's incredible what you guys are

750
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,020
gonna find is that these brain shot

751
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,120
therapies are truly a miracle

752
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,899
but you're also going to find this

753
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,520
where there is light darkness comes

754
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:08,100
where there is light

755
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,559
a miracle a true Miracle Darkness

756
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,880
doesn't like that

757
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,679
you're going to get those incredible

758
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,880
healing results but then the trolls are

759
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,620
going to come in

760
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,260
and then darkness is going to come in

761
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,700
and try to like cancel it oh those shots

762
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,279
don't work

763
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,020
oh medical medium doesn't work oh those

764
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,940
shots don't work get ready for all that

765
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,340
crap because the power of the light and

766
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,779
the power of what's in these books is

767
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,700
gonna just it's it's unlike anything

768
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,559
anybody's ever going to see No One's

769
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,120
Gonna See brain shots work like these

770
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,440
brain shots it does it's not going to

771
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,600
exist

772
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,820
Ellison said I did the dream shot last

773
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,760
night and it's hard to explain how much

774
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,500
it actually affected and felt

775
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,179
you know I had an experience like that

776
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,000
with my dream shot that I took it was

777
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,279
great however

778
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,779
what was most ironic was Anthony was in

779
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,440
my dream

780
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:00,600
it was very random but super ironic the

781
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,020
first time I do that shot I appear in

782
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,020
your dream

783
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:06,960
Jenny Jan says through the trolls

784
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,340
nothing beats results and results are

785
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,080
going to be there people are going to

786
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,640
have these miraculous results and then

787
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,140
the darkness is going to want to step it

788
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,360
up they're going to want to step up

789
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,039
their game

790
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
so there you know you guys already know

791
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,120
there's paid campaigns against medical

792
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,059
medium right

793
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,000
it was talked about out there publicly

794
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:29,760
by accident by people in an organization

795
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,919
that we're building a campaign fit with

796
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,899
lots of money fed by an organization to

797
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,440
try to like dumb down all of this

798
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:39,600
constantly with a lot of imposters too

799
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,120
putting out a lot of Impostors so

800
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,860
medical meeting Community is one badass

801
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,260
community and I'll tell you why because

802
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,419
you guys you know the crap you've gotten

803
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,220
when you said oh medical media I mean he

804
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,600
hears it from above and he hears it you

805
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,039
guys know what you had to fight through

806
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,899
and you know what your healing results

807
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,220
are you know what's out there in the

808
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:58,140
junk in the garbage out there in the

809
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,020
health movement you guys are heroes to

810
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:04,140
me Heroes to me

811
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,299
by the way imposters look out for them

812
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,740
they're out there

813
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:11,039
they say they're Anthony William

814
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,779
whatever they used my profile

815
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,640
they act like they're me they want to

816
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:15,659
constantly give you a consultation and

817
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,179
they ask

818
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,620
money and or not or they just do stupid

819
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:22,340
terrible things and they DM people

820
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,340
they're everywhere

821
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,380
okay

822
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,380
let's get back to work

823
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,460
burnout should not be a sole diagnosis

824
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:35,100
we should be diagnosed with the deeper

825
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,020
issues at hand viral inflammation toxic

826
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,779
heavy metals other poisons and solvents

827
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,000
MSG deposits lack of glucose lack of

828
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,740
mineral salts neuron problems injuries

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,200
to neurons neurotransmitter deficiencies

830
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,760
adrenal complications and vices that

831
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,320
were brought Upon Us by the drug pushers

832
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,779
such as the caffeine industry machine

833
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,720
burnout should be seen as a complex

834
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:57,299
interplay of factors leading us to run

835
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,159
low on what our brains physically need

836
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:01,760
to sustain and keep us

837
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,760
safe

838
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,140
so burnout stabilizer is addressing that

839
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,980
but hitting it hard addressing that the

840
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,980
powerful impact

841
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,480
you guys I'm reading out a brand saver

859
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,539
because it's the truth

860
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,500
cleanser heal is an incredible book and

861
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,620

because what happens is

892
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,960

so and that information shows me the

896
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,619
struggle she went through

897
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,020

898
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:42,119

you've had and what you've struggled

907
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,599

all right you guys

912
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,099
we are once again in the burnout

913
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,440
deficient brain section here supply and

914
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:15,240
demand the brain is complex electrical

915
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,280
grid that you know well by now by

916
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,200
reading the brain saver books everything

917
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,760
doesn't need to be perfect on that

918
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,920
electrical grid that we have right here

919
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,320
it doesn't have to be perfect we have

920
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,780
room to play but if the supplies we need

921
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,420
are dissipating it starts to tip the

922
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,119
scale starts at tip to scale is what it

923
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,920
does when we get in trouble once we see

924
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,900
the sides okay here's here's here's the

925
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,579
part that here's the part that bothered

926
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,099
me that Spirit of compassion put in the

927
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:43,079
book because it's truth but it just was

928
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,900
like oh bummer

929
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,240
once we see the signs we're already deep

930
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,680
in it that's why we have to do some

931
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,660
serious healing we need the burnout

932
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,700
stabilizer we need all of this we need

933
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,339
the brain shots we need the heavy metal

934
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,660
detox cleanses we need all of this we

935
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,099
need the celery juice we need the

936
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,280
medical medium tools that are saving

937
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,900
lives once we see the signs we're

938
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,520
already deep in it you know when Spirit

939
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,440
of compassion told me that and I was in

940
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,960
my office burning a hole in the chair

941
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,880
you guys know

942
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,560
sure it was like probably three in the

943
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,300
morning

944
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,980
once I heard that once we see the signs

945
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,680
he said you have to put this in it he

946
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,540
goes once we see the signs we're already

947
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,460
deep in it and that made me think about

948
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,079
oh my God that's how much work we have

949
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,460
to do and that's why sometimes it takes

950
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,920
a little longer for people to heal

951
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,440
because they're so deep in it but the

952
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,900
brain shots help us get there faster now

953
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,820
boom like lightning it's like that

954
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,240
instant relief even pick it up quicker

955
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,240
and faster

956
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,619
okay what our brains are missing let's

957
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,599
go into that for a couple minutes too

958
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,160
but I feel an intermission coming along

959
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,839
pretty soon

960
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,880

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,359

962

984
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,920
I told her to compassion I wanted to

985
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,940
have an egg Shack cook eggs for

986
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,000

I can't run an egg Shack I can't do

993
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,660

994
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,160

that

996
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,800
I said what about a hot dog truck

997
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,900
he said no are you crazy

998
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,359
you don't want to grind all those pigs

999
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,339
up and put them in a

1000
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,760
sausage skit and

1001
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:08,359

1004
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,599
when I was a little kid these are the

1005
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,099
things you think about you see a hot dog

1006
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,020
truck when you're seven years old and

1007
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,760
you're like I would like to run a hot

1008
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,560
dog truck

1009
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,300
but I wanted to run the egg Shack and

1010
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,339
spirit of compassion said no the eggs

1011
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,260
are going to give people such sicknesses

1012
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,820

all right

1027
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,760
our brains are missing the things they

1028
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,820
need there's trace minerals salt

1029
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,740
deficiencies there's different things

1030
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,900
that our brains need that's what we're

1031
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,640
talking about here and that's what we

1032
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,160
need to fix

1033
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,300
keep in mind

1034
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,839
all right

1035
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,880
plain old salt is not a trace mineral

1036
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,820
loving healing says my mom is still

1037
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,760
struggling with the loss of my dad

1038
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,520
so I made her the shock and loss shot

1039
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,680
she felt like it really helped and she

1040
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,140
was able to handle stress that's

1041
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,000

1046
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,700
energy exposure shot last night and felt

1047
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,180
a bit different

1048
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:53,280
when I am feeling negative I usually

1049
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:58,140
have to journal it out to release my

1050
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,140
emotions I took the shot incredible

1051
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,000
the negative energy exposure shot I love

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,820
everywhere people and things and places

Kirsten says I can drink 32 ounces of

1077
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,980
celery juice now that's incredible when

1078
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,140
at the start I could only drink four

1079
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,680
ounces I won't have to go to the doctor

1080
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,780
anymore I'm so happy so much energy no

1081
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,640
pain what happens is that like some

1082
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,680
people don't drink four ounces so some

1083
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,180
people sorry they'll drink celery juice

1084
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,740
but they don't know the medical meme

1085
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,839
information so they'll give up on it

1086
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,540
because they don't know that you can

1087
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,180
start low they don't know you can start

1088
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,180

things they do it's one of the things

1199
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:51,000

00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,680
we're doing the burnout stabilizers so

1201
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000

00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:17,579

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,359
it's kind of dim right there

1297
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,599
right

1298
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,240
when I did the beach

1299
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,680
um betrayal and broken trust shot

1300
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,480
I'm trying to read a comment and keeps

1301
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,740
on going up

1302
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,740
I wonder if it could be larger

1303
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:23,400
I gotta get a larger screen that can

1304
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,780
hold more comments they're flying up

1305
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,160
they're doing all kinds of stuff and I'm

1306
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,760
losing some

1307
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,760
okay

1308
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,540
Lorraine now says they literally can't

1309
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,980
stand it because you're right and we

1310
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,260
know it

1311
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,059
so let's go into it

1312
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,200
we're going to the burnout stabilizer

1313
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:42,200
let's find it

1314
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:48,380
here we are

1315
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,380
okay you guys let's make it

1316
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:52,880
I'm excited so with this

1317
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,819
let's put things aside here let's move

1318
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,540
along

1319
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:59,540
foreign

1320
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,180
excited about this one the burnout

1321
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,940
stabilizer always gives me an instant

1322
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,500
effect usually on the first sip most

1323
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,559
every time on the second sip no matter

1324
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,940
what but it's really exciting let's do

1325
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,940
it are you guys do you have your juicers

1326
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:19,619
out by the way the mm-1500

1327
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,540
just letting you guys know and I forgot

1328
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:24,119
to tell you the other day not only is it

1329
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:28,260
20 off but the mm 1500

1330
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:30,720
makes nut Butters nut milks salsas

1331
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,800
hummuses

1332
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,480
thank you

1333
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,380
it makes

1334
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,780
almost it's incredible it makes sorbets

1335
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,700
this isn't this just a juicer but what's

1336
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,660
incredible about it is when you juice

1337
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,460
through it

1338
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,260
it's got that high compression and you

1339
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,839
squeeze all that juice out and you save

1340
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,280
money it's incredible

1341
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,260
there's a lot of tricky juicers out

1342
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,359
there you know the sharks are coming in

1343
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,500
trying to sell people to juicers now and

1344
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:57,119
they're all getting ripped off because

1345
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,680
they're spying all this produce and

1346
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,660
they're only getting so much juice it's

1347
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,940
terrible how much I see I've seen it too

1348
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,280
on social media I see people using those

1349
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,960
juicers the bad ones and I see them

1350
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,000
putting in a ton of produce to make a

1351
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,500
big vat of juice but the amount of

1352
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,880
produce they put in they have no idea

1353
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,800
they would have had to only use a

1354
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,420
fraction of that half of that or

1355
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,480
whatever to actually do what they got to

1356
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:22,260
do this is the Omega mm-1500

1357
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,760
right and mm-900 both these I work I

1358
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,319
endorse both these I worked with the

1359
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,640
company and endorsed both these models

1360
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:29,359
they're incredibly safe people money

1361
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,359
just want to tell you

1362
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:37,020
Gohan says Anthony and SOC 10 years ago

1363
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:41,099
I was diagnosed with brain illness

1364
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:44,640
which doctors told me were uncurable

1365
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:47,280
I've lived a very challenging life

1366
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,740
both socially and career-wise

1367
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,300
I discovered your books two years ago

1368
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,819
incredible

1369
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,980
one week after I started applying the

1370
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:57,660
info into my life my symptoms

1371
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,880
disappeared

1372
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,559
like they never ever happened in the

1373
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,319
first place

1374
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:05,940
it's just incredible the doctors were

1375
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,579
baffled by this

1376
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,520
two years symptom-free and this was

1377
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:14,160
before I purchased seven

1378
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,079
and eight books

1379
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,420
which are brain saver and brain saver

1380
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,280
protocols I'm currently reading brain

1381
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,020
saver and applying to make sure my

1382
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,440
illness never returns again thank you

1383
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:29,700

hard that was for you what you went

1392
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,240
through it's more than what you said

1393
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,619
right there including the doctor so you

1394
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,940
didn't go to one doctor you've been to a

1395
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:55,260
whole bunch of doctors you went to some

1396
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,960
Specialists they drew a lot of blood

1397
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:00,800
from you all of it is just it's just a

1398
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:05,540

1460
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:13,819

00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,819
I'm sorry but they can't

1462
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:20,700
you're doing something for yourself

1463
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,500
it's unimaginable

1464
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:26,099
because the industries don't want us to

1465
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,480
heal nobody wants us to heal

1466
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:28,740
out there

1467
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,359

1468
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,440
swept under the carpet but when you

1469
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:35,160

will

1472
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,640
and you become enlightened as to what

1473
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:43,500
works and what is right

1474
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,480
and what is good

1475
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,799

1476
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,140

the candles at four ends

01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,559

I have to do whatever I can I don't have

1532
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:17,400

right

1551
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:01,140
to really like to trust and it takes a

1552
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:03,480
certain person

1553
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:05,099
to know what they're seeing and to

1554
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,900
understand and it takes a certain person

1555
01:03:05,099 --> 01:03:08,220
who's been through hell and back like

1556
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,200
you guys have been through hell and back

1557
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:12,119
to know what you have in your hands and

1558
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,980
understand this information and

1559
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:15,900
understand what's going on

1560
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,640
it was a diet there's a registered

1561
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,440
dietitian or whatever

1562
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,359
spouting out all kinds of crappy stuff

1563
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,319
about me the other day like saying

1564
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,099
things like

1565
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:27,780
science can't prove this works

1566
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:28,859
saying like science can't prove this

1567
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,180
worse what are you talking about first

1568
01:03:28,859 --> 01:03:31,680
of all science takes medical meme

1569
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,079
information all the time

1570
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,839
but she's also saying something like

1571
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,880
science can't prove how it works just

1572
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:41,520
because a

1573
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,260
Spirit of sun sort is giving him the

1574
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,240
information doesn't mean it works I mean

1575
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:47,460
this person was saying this

1576
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,260
so does that make any sense like science

1577
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,299
can't prove that medical medium

1578
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,460
information doesn't work

1579
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:55,380
okay Millions healing with all the

1580
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,640
information and science can't prove it

1581
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:58,559
doesn't work but they're not trying to

1582
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,900
prove anything anyway

1583
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,059
but this person was like if medical

1584
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:04,200
medium information worked science would

1585
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:06,480
say so

1586
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,460
really like does that make any sense

1587
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,200
like Signs would say so

1588
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:12,240
but the point is she wasn't making any

1589
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,299
sense she was like over and over again

1590
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,160
it was ridiculous anyway guys

1591
01:04:15,299 --> 01:04:18,780
medical research in science doesn't know

1592
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:20,700
medical meme information because it's

1593
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:24,119
Advanced it's far ahead of its time by

1594
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:25,500
light years 50 100 years long after I'm

1595
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:27,480
gone

1596
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,760
this information will still be the

1597
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,859
Forefront of the healing movement people

1598
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,359
will find their way to the books and

1599
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:35,640
research in science will still be in the

1600
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:39,299
Dark Ages with mystery chronic illness

1601
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:42,359
and the funny thing is remember

1602
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:44,400
the cause of multiple sclerosis

1603
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:46,559
was taught by me for decades and

1604
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,000
published years ago and Harvard took

1605
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,200
that information and they published it

1606
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,299
just recently

1607
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,400
saying that Epstein-Barr causes Ms I

1608
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:55,260
already beat him to it many years and I

1609
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,660
also showed everybody the details of how

1610
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:59,760
it happens far Advanced information from

1611
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,099
Spirit and compassion

1612
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,720
about what's wrong with this and how we

1613
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:05,339
Heal The credibility is there the street

1614
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,380
cred is there

1615
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:09,000
so when a dietitian says celery doesn't

1616
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,920
work

1617
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,599
or you should eat a celery stick instead

1618
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,819

01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:17,579
compression over here that's from making

1669
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:20,059
sure you're squeezing all the juice out

1670
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:20,059
of your

1671
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,220
your resources so you're not wasting

1672
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,140
money

1673
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,640
and you're actually putting money back

1674
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:28,680
into the machine the machine pays for

1675
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,020
itself and then pays for itself over and

1676
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,640
over again saving money while juicing in

1677
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,980
a in an environment today where food

1678
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,960
costs are up you're juicing your herbs

1679
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,760
and your leafy greens

1680
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,319
and all of that you're making your brain

1681
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,180
shots and you're saving money at the

1682
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:45,720
same time that can only be done with the

1683
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:47,760
mm 1500 and mm-900 so the juicer sharks

1684
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,680
out there are ripping people off

1685
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,200
