1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
today which is kind of exciting I

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,660
haven't had a chance to talk about B12 I

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,880
get asked about it all the time lots of

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,679
questions but I haven't had the time

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,420
been putting the books up getting those

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,360
done and ready so they're out in your

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,980
hands working on other things getting

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,260
free information out all the time

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,980
working on on medicalmedium.com I hope

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,600
you're watching this from

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,779
medicalmedium.com that would be really

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,760
incredible and so all that I'm doing I

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,580
don't have time and we get a lot of

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,239
questions lots of them and a big portion

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,660
of questions are what about B12 you know

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,059
how about B12 what's the best B12 like

17
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,340
constantly ask that and I can't address

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,980
it every minute I can't address it every

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,960
day it's not humanly possible so every

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,360
now and then once in a blue moon I have

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,940
to be like okay let's see if we can at

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,860
least answer some questions help out the

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,440
big crowd of people that actually want

24
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,820
to know more about B12 so that's why I'm

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,320
here and I want to do more of these

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,300
kinds of things too because so many

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
questions so many concerns and

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,660
everything else

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,000
so right now that's what we're talking

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,700
about so I have some information

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,619
in the brain saver books

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,020
um if you have these books incredible

33
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,840
then you already know how packed they

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,180
are and I have a B12 in front of me

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,799
right here that's the vimorgy B12 so

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,560
that's the one that I take it's the one

37
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,140
I recommend to family and friends it's

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
the one that I feel is the best there is

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,659
and and I can tell you guys about

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,259
vimorgy as far as the four things and I

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,140
say this because it's for mind-blowing

42
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
things I mean I don't even know what to

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,200
say so if you're somebody and you're

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,880
looking for supplements out there and

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,520
you're wondering what B12 is the best or

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,400
you're looking for different things what

47
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,100
you won't find anywhere so before I go

48
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,840
into the B12 information mind-blowing

49
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,840
information which you won't find

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,979
anywhere with supplement companies from

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,340
what I've seen and learned is that label

52
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,700
requirements allow supplement companies

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,000
to hide a small percentage

54
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,640
of ingredients in the product without

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,640
ever disclosing it to the consumer so

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,680
think about that for a minute so it's

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,160
legal for that to happen label

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,480
requirements allow supplement companies

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,720
to legally have undisclosed

60
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,760
small percentages of other ingredients

61
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,099
in the supplement that you don't know

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,739
about right so you won't know about

63
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,020
then Richie says no I won't do that

64
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,920
they say we won't do that we will not

65
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:44,340
ever have a small percentage of hidden

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,540
ingredients that we won't disclose to

67
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,400
our consumer they refuse to do that on

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,980
any level so that right there blows my

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,560
mind because I've talked to a lot of

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,340
companies and I can't get that out of

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,860
them

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,720
so that's that right there is just

73
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,640
everything to me another thing too

74
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,599
before we go into B12 information and

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,400
all that

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,319
another thing that's mind-blowing right

77
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,780
thermology products are third party

78
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,540
independently tested

79
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,480
but they keep to that which is

80
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,140
incredible they don't do in-house

81
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,080
testing if you know what I mean in-house

82
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,120
right right so that's a whole other

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,700
thing too that's incredible

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,360
the other thing is beverage products

85
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:34,159
contain no alcohol

86
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,260
no soy no gluten no citric acid no

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,900
maltodextrin you know what that is no

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,900
magnesium steroate no vinegar no

89
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,360
caffeine no natural flavors you guys

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,560
know by now about natural flavors I'm

91
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,900
pretty sure right through medical meme

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,459
info and other that you know that that

93
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,920
gets out there in the world from mm

94
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,900
books and stuff no natural flavors no

95
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,260
artificial flavors

96
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,760
no titanium dioxide but the mind-blowing

97
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,459
thing about it all

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,599
is no alcohol

99
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,760
no citric acid no maltodextrin no

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,739
natural flavors mind-blowing

101
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,319
but

102
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,979
here's the other thing no small

103
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,440
percentage of hidden ingredients that

104
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,760
could be virtually anything

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
and that's

106
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,979
enough for me to be like drop the mic

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
it's unbelievable and then then there's

108
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,220
the fourth thing

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,040
I just want to tell you guys the fourth

110
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,380
thing the quality tears

111
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,600
so what does that mean you if you start

112
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,520
a supplement company today you

113
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,259
say you get some investors or somebody

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,120
or you want to whenever you get some

115
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,740
money and you want to start a supplement

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,560
company

117
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,680
and then you want to start your product

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,740
you can choose from the quality levels

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,960
but you can always still claim quality

120
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,880
but no one realizes there's different

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,780
quality levels

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,639
there's a real high quality level that

123
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,500
supplement companies don't go to because

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,360
of price point

125
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,400
see how this works

126
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,259
this is mind-blowing

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,660
and guess what as I'm saying this now

128
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:14,520
supplement companies are probably like

129
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,699
watching this going

130
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,699
[Music]

131
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,699
um

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,880
oh yeah well uh because this is mind

133
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,900
freaking blowing is what I'm trying to

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,720
tell you

135
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,840
so vimorgy chooses the higher quality

136
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,940
that they can possibly find the highest

137
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,820
quality they can possibly find

138
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,759
and that is something that I believe

139
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,139
doesn't exist out there and so when you

140
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,880
think about that because they don't care

141
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,759
about the price point

142
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,979
if they'll pay more for the best thing

143
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,960
they can possibly find and still keep

144
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,580
the cost down as low as they can and

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,639
that's the whole point and so when you

146
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,720
look at those four things right there I

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,699
just want to get those out of the way

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,699
because those are worth celebrating

149
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,699
they're worth talking about they're

150
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,560
worth like everything to me those four

151
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,880
things so if you're somebody that's on

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,759
here you're like what's he talking about

153
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,320
now that's a hundred percent why I

154
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,060
endorse the company and said I will

155
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,100
stand behind you guys with everything I

156
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,320
got I will tell everybody anywhere

157
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,539
anyhow to make sure these supplements

158
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,820
stay alive in the world because when you

159
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,100
take those four things you don't want to

160
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,819
lose that I don't want the supplements

161
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,819
to go away so I can't take them

162
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:32,580
I don't want the supplements to go away

163
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,860
and disappear so that I don't have this

164
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,840
incredible these incredible supplements

165
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,940
to take when I think about that my

166
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,100
family I got family and friends that

167
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,680
rely on the highest quality and the best

168
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,900
stuff for their health and everything I

169
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
don't want that to disappear

170
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,759
I don't want those four incredible

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,819
points I mentioned disappear so I'm

172
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,220
gonna income 100 endorse them in the

173
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,400
highest light and tell people about it

174
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,800
and that's how how it works as far as

175
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,479
with that but anyway it's not about B12

176
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,340
and that's what we're here for

177
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,699
so I'm excited you guys

178
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,860
sell the whole bit Iona says Bemidji

179
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,600
admits a strong light frequency into my

180
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,419
house and I believe that you're on

181
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,220
YouTube I believe that because I have a

182
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,900
spiritual connection and it and

183
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,099
obviously you know SOC and everything

184
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,319
else

185
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,660
and spiritually spiritually connected to

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,580
everything that goes inside my body

187
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,400
a piece of kale

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,380
I could feel it enter my body I could

189
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
feel I could res it you know I could

190
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,740
actually

191
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,639
resonate with the frequency from a piece

192
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,699
of kale

193
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,280
so it's like that with supplements too I

194
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,840
can resonate with them I know the

195
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,539
garbage and what's not Catherine

196
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,300
Elizabeth spaniel says vimergy is the

197
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,940
best I used to get an itchy face from

198
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,539
taking B12 I was told that I was

199
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,419
allergic to methyl I have no issues with

200
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,220
beverages B12 even my very sensitive sun

201
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,620
takes memories supplements now the

202
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,800
reason why could be a couple of things

203
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,960
Catherine on that

204
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,300
no hidden percentage of ingredients that

205
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,479
label requirements allow you to hide and

206
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,880
not disclose that doesn't exist in the

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,639
vanishing products

208
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,400
that's just one reason why

209
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,259
you you could be experiencing such an

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,259
incredible experience never mind so many

211
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,580
others that I could go on forever right

212
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,520
so

213
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,520
these things matter but what happens is

214
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,919
I can't talk about B12 every day

215
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,659
because I just don't have the time or

216
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,800
the energy but we notice that when the

217
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,959
questions build up and the questions

218
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,779
build up and I'm dm'd a thousand times

219
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,159
about B12 I have to spend some time so I

220
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,320
want to give you guys any kind of

221
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,920
mind-blowing information I can about B12

222
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,260
too so I wanna I want to offer that

223
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,880
because it helps with questions and

224
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,580
people's concerns about B12 or

225
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,399
understanding about B12 I wanna B is

226
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,200
informative as I possibly can

227
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,720
because it's all about health it's all

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,260
about well-being it's all about moving

229
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,320
forward all of that so and uh Sienna

230
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,060
says love my memory B12 every day my

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,339
girls love it too because it's actually

232
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,519
it actually tastes delicious

233
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:21,300
it does taste delicious with no

234
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,700
junk or natural flavors or anything in

235
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,880
there and it tastes delicious and that's

236
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,260
a whole nother thing it's just whoa when

237
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,080
you think about it

238
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,459
David says I only take memory and the

239
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,880
thing is so

240
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:37,680
with me it's about it's about that

241
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,880
vibration it's about that frequency

242
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
that's a big part of of how I connect to

243
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,260
something too

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,899
and so when I feel like the vimoracy

245
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,760
products and I hold them in my hand I

246
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,920
know what I'm feeling you know I'll have

247
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,660
a friend every now that comes over or

248
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,279

00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,760
and I'll be like well let me check that

251
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399

272
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,720
all of that natural flavorings and all

273
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,200

274
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,500

if you guys have a second

277
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:00,380
so

278
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,420
all of here's something that's

279
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,579
interesting that's in the brain saver

280
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,620
book check this out this is incredible

281
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,720
when I saw this line I was like I have

282
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,680
to read this to everybody

283
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,680
I just do

284
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,839
um Amber says member gb12 has been so

285
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,980
helpful for my son with autism I'm so

286
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,320
grateful

287
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,700
right there on YouTube incredible I mean

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,519
that that that has so much meaning to me

289
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,700
really does okay so I want to read this

290
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,740
little line right here passing negative

291
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,120
thoughts

292
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,120
can't deplete

293
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,100
your brain cells of B12

294
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,800
so passing negative thoughts right think

295
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
about this

296
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,100
so if you got negative thoughts and

297
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,100
they're going through your brain

298
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,440
negative thoughts that are passing

299
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,019
through the brain

300
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,120
cannot deplete

301
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:08,120
your B12

302
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
.

303
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,399
right that alone is just mind-blowing

304
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:16,200
when I read this in here

305
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,540
positive thoughts

306
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,060
in your brain

307
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,779
cannot

308
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,399
refill your brain cells with B12

309
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,260
so when you're thinking positive

310
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,220
thoughts which I try to think all the

311
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,740
time

312
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,720
I don't want to think negative thoughts

313
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,860
unless Spirit of compassion is telling

314
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,839
me things

315
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,279
about how the world Works what's

316
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,000
happening in the world

317
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,240
all about all of that anything stressful

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,220
of course you know which is no fun and

319
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,639
of course life is not easy we go through

320
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,519
a lot in life and I don't want to also

321
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,440
be stuck on any negative thoughts but

322
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,680
what's incredible here

323
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,360
is positive thoughts cannot refill your

324
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,000
brain cells with B12

325
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:07,399
so negative thoughts

326
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,399
cannot deplete your brain of B12

327
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,899
positive thoughts can't refill your

328
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,180
brain cells with B12

329
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,880
so we can be somewhere on a Mountaintop

330
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,800
we could be praying

331
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,660
we can be in a spiritual Retreat

332
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,160
somewhere and the spiritual Retreat

333
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,560
somewhere

334
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,820
totally relaxing

335
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,820
doing some healing

336
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,160
you know and

337
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:37,160
still we can't refill the brain with B12

338
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,779
we can take a walk in nature

339
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
and we're thinking positive thoughts

340
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,519
while we're taking a walk in nature and

341
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,519
we can't refill the brain with B12

342
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
and here's really something that's

343
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,339
incredible right here yet negative

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,300
experiences

345
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:02,940
like betrayal I've experienced that

346
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,040
I mean I experience that a lot

347
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,420
right I mean

348
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,839
I do

349
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,240
betrayal broken trust

350
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,560
losses have you guys had your trust

351
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,940
broken ever

352
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,220
on any level

353
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,560
relationships

354
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,800
world tragedies too

355
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,839
can deplete your brain cells of B12 so

356
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,180
that can deplete us

357
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,300
I have here in the book

358
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,320
so that can deplete us

359
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,320
a B12

360
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,139
so when I got this information from SOC

361
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,380
and I wrote it down

362
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,820
when I was doing the books

363
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,160
so these

364
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,959
points just blew my mind when I even

365
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,899
think about it

366
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,120
because it's so advanced

367
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:56,040
Nobody Knows the information

368
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,519
so passing negative thoughts can't

369
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,440
deplete your brain cells of B12

370
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,660
when they're passing through your brain

371
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,760
in mind positive thoughts can't refill

372
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,220

if you lose your B12 from your brain

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,160
cells you can become played out and

436
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,160
burnt out and that's another thing too

437
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,419
if we lose our B12 from our brain and

438
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,360
brain cells

439
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,160
so if we're losing B12 from our brain

440
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:05,900
cells

441
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,900
we can get pretty played out

442
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,960
pretty burnt out

443
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,380
even if we're playing

444
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,640
and we're having fun we're on vacations

445
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,640
we're on ski trips

446
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,780
we're having fun we're on a boat

447
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,240
somewhere we're on a lake

448
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,860
whatever we're having fun we're on the

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,900
beach

450
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,640
we're at a party

451
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,640
we're having a great time at a party

452
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:39,000
we're still losing

453
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,980
B12 and we can still get played out

454
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,120
and it doesn't mean it's easy recovery

455
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,220
too

456
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,480
so if you have too much fun it doesn't

457
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:51,860
mean it's easy recovery without B12

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,860
that's just incredible information

459
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,760
Linda says wow passing negative thoughts

460
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,620
deplete B12 no actually you can have

461
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,240
passing negative thoughts going through

462
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,039
your brain and it won't deplete your

463
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,400
b12.

464
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,860
and positive thoughts

465
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,080
won't refill your B12 in your brain

466
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,840
that's what it is watch this from the

467
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,460
from the beginning again afterwards but

468
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm really happy you're here I'm happy

469
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,200
you're hearing you comment it

470
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,780
okay

471
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,539
if you lose your B12 from your brain

472
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,580
cells you can become played out burnt

473
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:38,100
out from too much play and not easily

474
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,440
recover you can become drained from too

475
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,700
much fun and need a vacation from your

476
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,620
vacation

477
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,559
it's why a lot of people

478
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,200
they get burned out on their vacations I

479
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,200
know a lot of people out there some of

480
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,200
the most powerful people in the world

481
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,660
they take a lot of vacations

482
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,640
which is which is great

483
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,400
but I've seen

484
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,380
seeing them take so many vacations where

485
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,320
they're burnt out and then

486
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,179
they need a vacation from their vacation

487
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,860
when really they're getting burned out

488
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,860
they're losing their B12 Reserves

489
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,480
a difficult emotional struggle can do

490
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:22,020
the same so if we have a difficult

491
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,120
emotional struggle on any level we can

492
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,120
get depleted over a b12.

493
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,000
and it can burn us out if we're lacking

494
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,500
B12 that's another thing if you have an

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,820
emotional struggle it can burn you out

496
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,820
if you're lacking B12

497
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,539
recovery is very difficult without good

498
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,740

hard

515
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,320
we're we are relying on the strength of

516
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,660
the nuts and bolts to hold that car

517
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,460
together so it doesn't start falling

518
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,140
apart so every time you're in your car

519
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,760
and you're driving and you want to step

520
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,919
on that gas

521
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,100
you're relying

522
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,299
your life is depending on the nuts and

523
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,419
bolts

524
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,340

00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,520
holding everything together

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,820
your wheels all four wheels are held on

527
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,860
by those lug nuts

528
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,740
in the right the lug nuts in the bolts

529
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,659
or your tire goes off

530
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:58,380
when you step on that gas really hard

531
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:01,380
you're relying on hundreds and actual

532
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,419
thousands of nuts and bolts holding that

533
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,880
car together

534
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,299
your life depends on those nuts and

535
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,299
bolts

536
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,260
you're relying on the strength of the

537
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,780
nuts and bolts to hold that car together

538
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,520
so it doesn't start falling apart so

539
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,980
when we drive that car and we're

540
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,799
cruising we're on the highway

541
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,020
everything depends on the strength of

542
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,700
that car on everything that's holding

543
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,200
that car together all those nuts and

544
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,419
bolts

545
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,159
when you even think about that same

546
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,780
thing on a plane

547
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,580
if you're flying in a plane and you're

548
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,799
up in the air

549
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,640
it's really a car in the air with wings

550
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:45,179
that has an engine in it or engines

551
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,120
and it's still all Nuts and Bolts

552
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:50,400
I know an airplane mechanic works on the

553
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,220
big ones

554
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,500
and he tells me all the time

555
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,059
let everybody that's up there

556
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,100
flying around

557
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,039
if they only knew

558
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,320
it's all about the nuts and bolts the

559
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,419
nuts and bolts he tightens

560
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,000
on the routine maintenance

561
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,799
so when the planes down on the ground he

562
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,960
goes in there

563
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,700
and he's got the air tools and he says

564
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,919
he has to go in there and he says the

565
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,080
bolts loosen up

566
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,520
and if it's a bad mechanic guy that's

567
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,900
working on the planes that's not going

568
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,940
to help because now you're really either

569
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,960
at risk but he says he has to go in

570
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
there

571
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,440
in between every now and then on

572
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,240
maintenance

573
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,280
and he says you can't believe he can't

574
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,320
he actually he can't believe how many

575
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,600
bolts loosen up on those planes the big

576
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,640
commercial planes

577
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,580
he says sometimes he finds them so loose

578
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,500
they're almost completely falling out

579
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,659
engine mounts

580
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,559
in the planes it's holding the engines

581
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,240
in

582
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,100
so he goes in there and he has to

583
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,380
tighten up all those nuts and bolts

584
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,280
that's what he does with the machines on

585
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,280
all the airliners it's his job

586
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,539
and he says if people only knew and I'm

587
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,220
not trying to scare you anything but he

588
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,960
says people only knew

589
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,640
what's holding that together when

590
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,659
they're flying he says it's a car but

591
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,659
it's a car up in the air

592
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,600
when we're using our brains B12

593
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,559
okay

594
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,480
that's one of the nuts that's holding it

595
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,240
all together

596
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,880
so just like this guys my friend this

597
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,440
guy's he's actually zipping a couple of

598
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
bolts together holding the engine in on

599
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,880
the plane

600
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,919
one of those bolts on that plane is kind

601
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,919
of like the B12 in US

602
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,780
holding us together while we're going

603
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,700
through all this emotional traffic

604
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,380
an emotional BS that we're up against

605
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,380
out there because so much is going on

606
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,059
going at us in life it's not easy Lana

607
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,340
says I've been drinking beverages V12

608
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:58,080
for over four years along with being on

609
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,659
medical medium protocols and it has

610
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,840
changed my life Bemidji supplements are

611
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,539
pure powerful and the company has

612
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,860
Integrity you're on YouTube Lana I just

613
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:13,860
I just saw your um comment last night on

614
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,360
the brain shot challenge the day 10 one

615
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,500
I just saw you left a big comment on

616
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,500
there I just want to let you know that I

617
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,100
did see it and read it

618
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,100
foreign

619
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,600
so when you think about it like what's

620
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,480
holding us together

621
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,620
Spirit of compassion

622
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,360
always told me it's like exactly

623
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,799
it's one of those things that holds us

624
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,679
together

625
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:42,600
so when we're using our own B12 as one

626
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,840
of those nuts and bolts holding it all

627
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,840
together

628
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,520
some people blow through their B12

629
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,140
supplies faster due to different

630
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:55,440
experiences and exposures using up their

631
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,360
reserves so that's the thing

632
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
so if a plane is hitting a lot of

633
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,880
turbulence because of a lot of bad

634
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,679
weather

635
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,179
it's putting more stress on those nuts

636
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,240
and bolts

637
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,700
if we're going through life

638
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,039
and we're hitting some rocky ground and

639
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,600
some storms and some bad weather what's

640
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,760
it using

641
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,720
it's using one of those nuts and bolts

642
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,720
which is the B12

643
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,100
that's incredible that's a way to look

644
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,659
at it that actually helps me when I was

645
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,720
getting that information and putting in

646
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:29,340
here

647
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,799
so some people though they blow through

648
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:36,740
those nuts and bolts pretty quickly

649
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,740
because of the rocky turbulence in life

650
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,179
and they end up blowing through the

651
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,340
reserves

652
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:46,799
I mean that's incredible

653
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,380
to some extent everybody is depleted in

654
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,020
V12 to some extent everybody is depleted

655
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,380
in B12 I know I talked to a lot of

656
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,380
doctors

657
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,820
and I give the information out to a lot

658
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,779
of doctors and and doctors give me a lot

659
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,779
of information too

660
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,360
about it and

661
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,340
a lot of doctors agree with me and say

662
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,659
yes there's no question there's there's

663
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:15,980
a

664
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,980
a depletion out there

665
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,240
every nerve cell has to have a certain

666
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,240
amount of B12

667
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,779
I mean it's not a positive thing

668
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:29,460
everybody's depleted but it's incredible

669
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:32,100
when you think about it

670
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,900
of how it works out there

671
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,039
and the information here is just

672
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,080
profound

673
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,840
every nerve cell has to have a certain

674
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,480
amount of B12 and yet we walk around

675
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,580
with nerve cells that are deficient with

676
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,980
B12

677
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,779
which is a whole nother problem

678
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,000
going on out there

679
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,740
is our nervous systems

680
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,380
the cells themselves

681
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,900
are lacking B12

682
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,020
many of us walk around

683
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,200
with nerve cells

684
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,720
that are mildly depleted to extremely

685
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,360
depleted

686
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,940
and then we can feel that along the way

687
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,820
with burnout

688
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,799
someone just said 100 depletion I saw on

689
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,080
there

690
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,640
so another thing I want to mention which

691
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,679
has always been incredible medical

692
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,059
medium information and worth talking but

693
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,279
there's so much more information about

694
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,380
B12 in here so we're not done you guys

695
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,360
we still got some ground to cover if you

696
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,279
guys just came on here

697
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,140
I'm just talking about B12 because so

698
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,240
many people are asking me about B12 and

699
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,559
I want to make sure I provide

700
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,419
um just really profound incredible

701
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,059
information about it I want to talk

702
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:45,059
about the metaphysical aspects of

703
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:47,100
of B12 with us so that's one thing right

704
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,720
there that's important too so we're

705
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,600
going to cover that I also want to talk

706
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,659
about B12 shots for a few minutes I also

707
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,760
want to talk about B12 production

708
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,220
inside here

709
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,640
right there so if you guys still have a

710
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,559
few minutes let's cover some you know

711
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,960
killer information that's really just

712
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,179
awesome and fun too and if you just got

713
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,460
here what you see here is the

714
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,919
is the vimergy B12

715
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,539
okay now that's the big bottle

716
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,340
which is incredible

717
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,600
on its own

718
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,340
so

719
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,279
and I want to talk about also a little

720
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,960
bit with blood testing and b12 and all

721
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,299
of that as well too so that's the next

722
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,279
thing so we got a few topics to cover

723
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:31,260
but just if you got here and you're

724
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,299
looking at this a lot of people say

725
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,120
what's the best B12 what's the one you

726
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,260
like this is my favorite this is my

727
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,779
favorite

728
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,539
um the brand that's my favorite of all

729
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:46,260
that's the vimergy V is in Victor i m is

730
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:48,179
in Mary e r g y.com vemergy.com

731
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,340
and go there and check out their B12

732
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:53,279
that's your larger bottle

733
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,200
and what's incredible is it doesn't

734
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,820
contain

735
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,880
alcohol

736
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,399
contains no natural flavors no citric

737
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,159
acid no maltodextrin no caffeine no

738
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,080
vinegar no a whole bunch of things that

739
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,720
I see in all the supplements out there

740
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,640
so that's remarkable all on its own and

741
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,260
there's the four reasons I talked about

742
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,520
earlier so watch this video from the

743
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,500
start if you want to know the four

744
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,480
reasons that will just make you go okay

745
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,860
I've never heard anything like it

746
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,260
including

747
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,299
they don't have hidden ingredients on a

748
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,679
small percentage that label requirements

749
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,480
allow all the supplement companies to

750
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,460
have in the bottles and not disclose it

751
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,960
or beverage says no we're not going to

752
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,580
do that we're not going to put anything

753
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,580
in there that we don't disclose

754
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,539
just it's incredible anyway so that's

755
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:42,419
the emerging B12

756
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,640
and I fully endorsed them

757
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:47,279
because they deserve it

758
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,020
times 100 I wish I could do more I wish

759
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,000
I can do so much more

760
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,320
like endorse them a hundred times I

761
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,360
don't know I don't know but I wish I

762
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,399
could do so much more because I'm

763
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,080
grateful for what they've done for the

764
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,120
people out there with products like this

765
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,960
so it's incredible so let's go into it a

766
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,810
little bit

767
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,760
where does B12

768
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,320
[Music]

769
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,320
where does B12 come from

770
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,260
our body is supposed to produce it

771
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,840
but we've lost our ability to produce

772
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:22,740
B12 it's not like it used to be

773
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:25,380
it's not easy to produce B12 so our body

774
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,820
is supposed to rely on its own

775
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:32,419
production of B12 right there

776
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,419
right there

777
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,480
right here

778
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,880
we're inside now we're inside the gut

779
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,659
I like this if you take this off it's a

780
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,640
great

781
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,440
it's a great one

782
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,820
blueberry love says beverage is

783
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,260
literally the best

784
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,480
and you can feel too you're on YouTube

785
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,100
amazing

786
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,440
so

787
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:01,440
the ilium is where we have this

788
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,440
microorganism

789
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,179
community

790
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:08,640
called elevated biotics medical medium

791
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:11,640
information about elevated biotics

792
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,340
so that is a big part of how we produce

793
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,100
our own B12 it's in this region right

794
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,200
here but we lose our ability to because

795
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,960
one of the reasons why

796
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,340
because their guts get all chewed up

797
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,480
and we talked about that in all the

798
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,220
medical meaning books but the other

799
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,059
reason why

800
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,080
is because we don't eat produce

801
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:37,020
that comes out of the garden too often

802
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,779
so if you grow some parsley if you grow

803
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,360
some cilantro if you grow something in

804
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,360
your garden or on your porch or on your

805
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,380
windowsill or on your counter top in

806
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,720
your kitchen

807
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,799
if you grow anything an herb that's

808
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,320
edible

809
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,179
some Sprouts that are edible what will

810
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,480
develop on those Sprouts are those herbs

811
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:59,640
will be elevated biotics microorganisms

812
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,620
that can go deep down into your

813
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,120
intestinal tract and colon and reach the

814
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,919
ilium

815
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,260
and when it reaches the illum it'll sit

816
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,419
there so if you ever picked an apple off

817
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,279
of a apple tree and you bit into that

818
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:12,779
apple and ate that Apple there's a whole

819
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,679
bunch of microorganisms on the outside

820
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:15,679
of that apple skin

821
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:23,840
which is incredible right

822
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,840
all right let me look for an apple now

823
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,159
that apple is still nutritious still

824
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,100
really good for me still good for you

825
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:34,980
it's a delicious apple looks like a Brae

826
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,779
Burn I think that's a Brae Burn

827
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,940
great Apple to eat

828
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,919
delicious apple

829
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,720
but it doesn't have the microorganisms

830
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,580
on the outside of the skin unless it was

831
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,340
picked off the orchard

832
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,340
and you were driving home and eating it

833
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,539
and having some of your Apple

834
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,460
but still medically that apple is

835
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,500
incredible for you are still good for

836
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,600
you and it has all the building blocks

837
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,899
everything we talk about the glucose the

838
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,760
trace minerals

839
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,320
hydration right

840
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,460
so good that's a Brae Burn it's

841
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,560
delicious

842
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,879
we've got a crunch to it

843
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,679
but

844
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,540
this wasn't picked at an orchard

845
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,659
recently

846
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,520
and it's and and unwashed

847
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,020
so if I go to an apple tree and I pluck

848
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,179
this thing

849
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,580
and I bite it

850
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,020
or I go to a farm and they pull the end

851
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,760
and they all picked them all and I went

852
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,060
home and I ate it you would get

853
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,339
microorganisms on the skin

854
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,619
this is MM info

855
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:40,020
those micro radios microorganisms can

856
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,060
find their way deep

857
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,659
to the ilium

858
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,659
right here

859
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,220
they help us produce B12

860
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,200
we don't have a lot of opportunities but

861
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,000
yet it doesn't mean don't eat your Apple

862
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,020
it means you better eat your Apple of

863
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,220
course for a whole bunch of other

864
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,220
reasons so you can heal

865
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,940
if you grow something

866
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,500
on your windowsill like some parsley

867
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,180
and you pluck that parsley and eat it

868
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,180
you just got those microorganisms

869
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:14,940
it's a big part about how we produce our

870
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,020
B12

871
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,020
I mean how incredible

872
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:27,440
how so many people in the world are

873
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,440
missing their B12 lacking their B12

874
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,760
that's a reason all on its own also the

875
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,579
world has got become so much more

876
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,660
difficult to navigate through more

877
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:42,000
stress everything else more challenges

878
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,920
more problems and that so that depletes

879
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,900
B12 right

880
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,940
let's talk about B12 testing for a

881
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,220
couple of minutes B12 testing is really

882
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,619
confusing because a blood test for B12

883
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,380
is a snapshot in time

884
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,560
not to mention

885
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,619
I always have told doctors

886
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,980
that you go by symptoms

887
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:07,440
versus the B12 test itself so much

888
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,940
you can have somebody with a lot of

889
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,940
neurological problems and symptoms

890
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,560
but their B12 looks like it's normal

891
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,599
and so the doctor then doesn't recommend

892
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,359
B12 to them because the blood test

893
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,940
looked like it was normal

894
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,060
when I talk to doctors and they

895
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,460
recommend B12

896
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,500
for their patient that has neurological

897
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,180
symptoms of their stuff they recommend

898
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,640
the B12

899
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,380
prescribe it or whatever

900
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,599
regardless of what the blood test is

901
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,800
saying and I talked to doctors that do

902
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,800
this they notice improvements

903
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,040
so they're thinking in their head

904
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,900
they're scratching their head

905
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,359
these doctors and are like well the

906
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,180
blood test look normal

907
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,760
but my patient is now improving

908
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,980
because of the good B12

909
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,119
. so then they're thinking well

910
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,800
hey

911
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,980
what's going on here if the blood test

912
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,839
showed one thing and so forth so I've

913
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,820
gone into detail about blood testing in

914
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,560
B12 in the medical medium books you guys

915
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,660
probably know

916
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,800
and I've gone into detail about how that

917
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,260
works

918
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,200
where just because you're higher in B12

919
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,000
does it mean your brain and nervous

920
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,119
system is getting the B12

921
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,140
just because you're elevated on the test

922
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:31,200
doesn't mean you're elevated in the

923
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,599
nervous system you can have B12 floating

924
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,640
around your bloodstream but not have

925
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,280
enough B12 in your nervous system this

926
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,640
is what I teach doctors and then they go

927
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,619
no wonder why my patient is feeling

928
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,619
better

929
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:48,540
when I put them on B12 even though their

930
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:51,480
blood test said they were high in B12

931
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:54,300
see see how it works

932
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,520
Linda says B12 changed my husband's

933
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,099
attitude now he is more relaxed less

934
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,680
stressful after two years we look we

935
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:05,359
took memories B12 daily

936
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,359
amazing that's incredible

937
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,400
another thing too you can be low in B12

938
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,500
in your bloodstream

939
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,420
but be but at the same time getting

940
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,980
enough B12 to your nervous system but

941
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,780
you can't see so one thing medical

942
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,880
research and science can't do is they

943
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,320
can't test B12 levels in the nervous

944
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,119
system

945
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,280
so when I talk to doctors and

946
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,400
neurologists

947
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,920
what I do is I talk about that with them

948
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,079
and I'm like yeah well is there a test

949
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,460
that I don't know about

950
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,079
where they can test your nervous system

951
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,900
for B12 levels and I hear it from

952
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:41,460
doctors all the time no there is an aw

953
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,740
there is not a test

954
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,119
for testing to see how much B12 is in

955
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,280
your nervous system

956
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,339
I go okay let me know when they come up

957
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,960
with that test 50 years from now

958
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:54,839
but

959
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,380
so we really don't see a lot with blood

960
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:01,140
tests regarding B12 we don't see enough

961
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:05,040
of the big picture

962
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:07,380
and that's confusing so when I talk to

963
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,880
doctors it's always like what are their

964
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,700
symptoms

965
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,000
that's what I'll say to doctors

966
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:18,599
monitor symptoms because there's so much

967
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,980
gray it's not black and white with B12

968
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,300
blood tests

969
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,220
so let's talk about another thing too

970
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,200
that's interesting

971
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,200
B12 shots

972
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,820
so I always say look do what your doctor

973
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,859
wants to do and do what's right for you

974
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,440
with your doctor

975
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:36,359
okay I'm showing you just the B12 that I

976
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,440
use every day recommend my family and my

977
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:39,440
friends right there

978
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,780
um

979
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,700
and you know ask your doctor what's

980
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,920
right for you what B12 your doctor wants

981
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,079
you on all of that

982
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,400
and dosages from your doctor and

983
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:53,880
everything else

984
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,859
you know consult your doctor for sure

985
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,200
but when it comes to like

986
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:02,099
my family my friends

987
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,020
they'll ask me should I get a B12 shot

988
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,760
I'll say well not I mean if your doctor

989
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,579
said see you know it's it's life or

990
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,859
death and it's a matter of you staying

991
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:12,180
alive and your doctor's uh convinced of

992
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:13,800
all that and they want to give you a B12

993
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,440
shot then just do what your doctor tells

994
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,440
you but I tell my family

995
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,820
and friends that I wouldn't get a B12

996
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,820
shot myself personally

997
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,079
because

998
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,760
and I've talked about this before and in

999
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,859
the brain saver books it's really

1000
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,859
comprehensive about B12 shots

1001
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,320
so what I've gotten information like my

1002
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,040
like what I like my personal opinion and

1003
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,680
what I tell doctors this oral is best

1004
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,900
so a lot of doctors contact me they want

1005
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,579
to learn information they'll ask me a

1006
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,099
lot of questions B12 is always on the

1007
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,839
list it's always on the list when

1008
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,880
doctors talk to me

1009
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:59,339
and I always say well they'll say well

1010
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,820
what do you like best aw do you like B12

1011
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:06,020
shots aw do you like B12 oral aw which

1012
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,020
one and it's always oral

1013
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,700
so anyway let's go into another area

1014
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,880
we'll go into this question here that

1015
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,640
Joshua Eldridge has why is B12 linked to

1016
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,240
psychic ability

1017
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,240
so

1018
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:26,480
so let's talk about B12

1019
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,480
with metaphysical

1020
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,180
so

1021
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,980
first and foremost you got to think

1022
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,820
about this

1023
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,820
B12

1024
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,800
right

1025
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,839
it's supporting your nervous system

1026
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,380
so remember that right there

1027
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:50,400
if B12 is supporting your nervous system

1028
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,820
what's in your nervous system

1029
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,380
this is your nervous system here

1030
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,079
what is that

1031
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,180
that's your brain

1032
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,280
that's your Noggin

1033
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,440
right there

1034
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,859
what's sitting inside your brain and

1035
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,859
Noggin

1036
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,220
your soul

1037
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:16,380
your soul lives on forever

1038
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,880
and maybe you don't believe that and

1039
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,740
that's okay I hope you still stay here

1040
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,320
and hope you're not mad at me for saying

1041
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,720
that that your soul lives on forever

1042
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:29,160
I hope I didn't offend anybody either I

1043
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,720
mean seriously my apologies if I did

1044
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,339
Spirit of compassion just told me that

1045
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,079
someone just said no the soul doesn't

1046
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:36,060
live on forever I don't like what I'm

1047
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,359
listening to and I I completely

1048
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,359
understand

1049
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,660
so

1050
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,619
but the information I've gotten from

1051
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,540
above

1052
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:48,660
and what I believe is our soul lives on

1053
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:52,920
forever past this life

1054
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:55,020
so when our physical body is gone

1055
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,119
our soul

1056
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,319
still exists

1057
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,319
and it travels

1058
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,599
and I actually wrote about the soul

1059
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,579
in the medical medium brand saver books

1060
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,260
so there's sole information in the brain

1061
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,060
saver books you guys so we just got here

1062
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,300
you got to get these copies when you can

1063
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:21,980
I mean seriously

1064
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,980
information so amazing

1065
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:28,079
so our soul when we're alive and we're

1066
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:31,380
physically here sits about here

1067
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,380
unless we had a trauma and then as I've

1068
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,240
written in these books

1069
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,400
soc's information about what happens

1070
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,260
when we go through a trauma our soul

1071
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,119
exits

1072
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,400
we get the out-of-body experience

1073
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,920
because when we have a hardship a

1074
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,619
breakup or the relationship a loss A

1075
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,420
trauma an emotional hardship

1076
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:55,800
a struggle

1077
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:58,920
if we do our soul can project out of our

1078
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,260
brain and stay close by

1079
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,480
and then we have an out-of-body

1080
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,940
experience or we feel like we're

1081
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:10,079
watching ourselves go through it or we

1082
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,940
feel like disconnected from it all

1083
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,980
now the information in the brain saver

1084
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,660
books talks about

1085
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,060
what happens here

1086
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:20,520
with this process

1087
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,680
that literally our soul can get knocked

1088
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,500
right out of us

1089
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,780
there's a reason for that it's to

1090
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,859
protect the soul so it doesn't become

1091
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,020
damaged and injured badly from an

1092
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:36,540
experience we're having here

1093
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,040
my boyfriend cheated on me literally

1094
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:41,960
your soul

1095
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,960
leaves your brain

1096
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,460
you know my girlfriend she cheated on me

1097
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,460
your soul leaves your brain

1098
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,700
so it doesn't become damaged or too

1099
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,700
injured by the experience

1100
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,760
or something just happened I just lost

1101
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,800
somebody a family member your soul

1102
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,359
leaves your brain

1103
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,160
so it becomes this out-of-body

1104
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,079
experience really

1105
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,819
or a protective measure and then your

1106
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,859
soul comes back

1107
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,040
stays real close by but then it comes

1108
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:13,040
back

1109
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,240
so our and I talk about it in detail

1110
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:21,000
though in the brain saver books our soul

1111
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,220
resides in her brain and because of that

1112
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,140
our brain isn't just physical

1113
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,140
it's physical and metaphysical

1114
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:33,060
we have a soul

1115
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,260
a subconscious

1116
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:40,560
a Consciousness and subconsciousness

1117
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,480
and a physical tissue

1118
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,260
there are four things

1119
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,260
with our brain

1120
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:51,560
B12

1121
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:51,560
plays a role with all four

1122
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,660
I mean

1123
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:01,260
it's incredible

1124
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:04,880
so our brain isn't just our brain

1125
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,880
and our soul lives wherever

1126
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,940
Tracy says are you saying we shouldn't

1127
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:11,280
wash our fruits and veggies no I'm not

1128
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,020
saying that I go in the medical medium

1129
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,839
books you'll read in there all about

1130
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,359
washing and all that I'm saying that

1131
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,640
if you go to the grocery store okay if

1132
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,339
you go to the grocery store and you're

1133
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,900
like oh well I better not wash

1134
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:26,520
that

1135
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,760
food item

1136
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,980
because I want to have those those

1137
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,440
elevated biotics on there no you that's

1138
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,200
not it because 50 people could have

1139
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:40,380
touched that item and that item could

1140
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,220
have also had chicken juices tripped on

1141
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:46,319
it through through when it was actually

1142
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,819
delivered when it was in a truck your

1143
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,220
produce could have been in the same

1144
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:52,380
truck as chicken is because they do they

1145
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,180
actually they actually mix them in the

1146
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:56,640
same truck it's not like just a produce

1147
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,700
truck all the time it's produce plus

1148
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,780
meat plus fish some you know chicken and

1149
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,160
you don't know what kind of

1150
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,099
contamination could have gotten to the

1151
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,560
cases of produce so you do want to wash

1152
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:09,599
your store-bought stuff

1153
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,980
because you don't know what's in there

1154
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,780
or on there

1155
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,940
and then when the produce is on the

1156
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,859
store shelves for like a while like the

1157
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,599
produce guy puts puts all that out there

1158
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:21,180
and you guys this is all good stuff to

1159
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,740
talk about it's critical anyway

1160
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:24,599
and you're putting because if you guys

1161
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,220
get food poisoning or sick from some

1162
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,200
produce that has something on it then

1163
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,760
you'll either be 12 reserves so you can

1164
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,599
drop more so it's got we gotta go over

1165
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,940
this

1166
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:37,220
if someone stocks all this cilantro up

1167
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,220
there the produce guy on the store shelf

1168
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,980
it's just his hands are touching it sure

1169
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,960
right but then you got people with

1170
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,880
rolling their cards by and they go

1171
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,380
through them I don't like that one throw

1172
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,599
it back in I don't like this one throw

1173
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,220
it back in someone could have just been

1174
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,780
in the bathroom and who knows how they

1175
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,280
washed their hands after they wipe their

1176
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,960
ass and it's just like you got all this

1177
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,900
going on

1178
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,040
and it just yeah and that can happen a

1179
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:04,200
hundred times during the day in the

1180
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,579
grocery store 100 people 200 people

1181
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,680
could go through all the produce right

1182
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,359
you want to wash it

1183
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,160
I'm just saying

1184
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,380
but I'm talking about like if you go to

1185
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,200
a farmer's market

1186
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,000
and this guy that's got like a truckload

1187
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,680
of kale a truckload of cilantro and it

1188
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,240
was all harvested and yes people touched

1189
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,500
it but there's a good chance that all

1190
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,540
you really need to do is probably give

1191
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,400
it just a rinse but if it was sitting in

1192
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,980
the farmer's market on

1193
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,240
display and and you didn't get there

1194
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,680
that early in that morning and 100

1195
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,180
people throughout the afternoon already

1196
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,560
went through it all to pick what they

1197
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,579
wanted and through what they didn't want

1198
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,440
back

1199
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,339
you guys gotta be careful you gotta wash

1200
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,980
it

1201
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:43,500
but if you grow it yourself

1202
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:45,599
that's another story

1203
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,220
so if you grow it yourself just on your

1204
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,720
windowsill just some Sprouts on your

1205
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:50,640
windowsill just some parsley under

1206
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,460
windowsill just a lemon balm anything

1207
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,099
you grow yourself right there on your

1208
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,480
windowsiller or in your backyard or on

1209
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,940
your porch depending on what time of

1210
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,220
year is just just whatever right in your

1211
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,940
own house and you grow something and you

1212
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:08,280
pluck one little piece of that

1213
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:10,260
there's elevated biotics on that little

1214
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,940
piece right there and you don't have to

1215
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,740
wash that you don't even have to rinse

1216
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,300
it just send it down and you just got

1217
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:17,300
those incredible microorganisms

1218
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,119
so back to the whole soul

1219
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,220
so it's not just our brain in here

1220
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,460
it's our soul our subconsciousness

1221
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,760
Consciousness and our physical brain all

1222
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,760
four

1223
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,680
so spirit and compassion has always told

1224
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,540
me

1225
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:41,339
for years

1226
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,339
B12 is one of these like metaphysical

1227
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:47,220
nutrients

1228
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,020
because it's like those nuts and bolts I

1229
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,420
was talking about in the plane or in the

1230
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:53,520
car it's there

1231
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,920
kind of hold it all together but what is

1232
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,040
it holding together because

1233
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,300
it's not just holding together the

1234
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,300
physical brain

1235
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,720
because the subconsciousness

1236
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:10,680
Consciousness and your soul is still

1237
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,780
there too so all four are there

1238
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,440
isn't it possible it's holding together

1239
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,440
something else

1240
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,140
isn't it

1241
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,000
I mean

1242
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,099
wouldn't it be kind of ridiculous to not

1243
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,440
think it is

1244
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:30,720
you got

1245
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:34,460
the construction in here is both

1246
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,460
metaphysical and physical

1247
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,359
you got the physical aspect which is the

1248
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:41,400
tissue itself you got the subconscious

1249
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,079
mind which is another aspect you got the

1250
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,579
conscious mind which is another aspect

1251
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,380
that's the conscious mind I'm talking to

1252
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:48,380
you with and then you've got the soul

1253
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,880
and they all have to work in harmony

1254
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,740
and so when I hold B12 like the good

1255
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,819
stuff I feel a frequency and a vibration

1256
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,819
and it feels good

1257
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,000
and a lot of times what I'll do is

1258
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,680
always do this when any time anytime

1259
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,119
anybody ever hands me a supplement of

1260
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,900
any kind

1261
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:16,260
I grab it I put one hand on my head

1262
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,359
and I hold it with my other hand

1263
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,880
so for years

1264
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:23,579
friends and family members and whatever

1265
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,020
have thrown things in my hand like all

1266
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:27,720
right

1267
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:30,119
give it the little run over here like

1268
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,859
fine give it to me my hand on my head

1269
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:35,059
why am I putting my hand on my head I'm

1270
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,059
trying to make a continuity

1271
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,280
so it's all about continuity

1272
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,680
continuity from here

1273
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,020
to up here to here so when you touch

1274
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,480
your head and you touch the bottle

1275
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,940
whatever that supplement is

1276
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,760
there's continuity between

1277
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:55,500
your brain going down your hand going

1278
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,240
down your elbow and your arm right

1279
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,960
through your torso going down to the

1280
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,280
other arm and grabbing on to the bottle

1281
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,160
and the reason why I'm creating

1282
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:07,140
continuity from my brain to my hand is

1283
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,460
what I'm doing is creating continuity to

1284
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,460
my brain to the bottle

1285
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:18,180
and I see how that feels

1286
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,119
and I've held stuff in my hands that

1287
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:25,940
when I did the continuity test

1288
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,940
I was like oh no way no way in hell

1289
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,319
now I know I haven't told too many

1290
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:32,940
people it's kind of a private thing that

1291
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:34,859
I have

1292
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,900
but I try to tell you guys as many

1293
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:38,819
private things as I can I have if you

1294
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,980
look back on medical medium information

1295
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:42,540
everything else I've given you guys as

1296
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,920
much private information as I could

1297
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,599
think of it I can't there's so many

1298
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,460
things I do

1299
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,619
that I have to make a show out of each

1300
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,660
one like I'll do a whole podcast on this

1301
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:54,300
eventually about that continuity thing

1302
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,480
that I do I just haven't had time it's

1303
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,599
just I can only do so much

1304
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,619
but the continuity test is what I do

1305
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:03,619
so I feel

1306
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,059
the product itself and this is in

1307
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,059
kinesiology

1308
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,640
so I know that a lot of you people like

1309
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,140
oh that's an easy out it's not that's

1310
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:16,079
not it at all I've been doing this since

1311
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:17,940
I was little and it's a continuity test

1312
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,920
it's entirely different so this isn't

1313
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,260
about Kinesiology about what your body

1314
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,180
needs or doesn't want to want to need or

1315
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,880
whatever it is doesn't need or want

1316
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,220
or feel right too

1317
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,500
this is about the continuity between

1318
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,780
literally your brain this is a personal

1319
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,420
between yourself with no other person

1320
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,920
involved so this isn't like you go to

1321
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,240
some kinesiologist or something like

1322
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,800
this and they're yanking on your own

1323
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,420
that's not what this is you're not being

1324
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,420
governed by somebody else's free will

1325
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,380
so the reason why

1326
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,440
this test

1327
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:54,180
is so powerful is because no one's Free

1328
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,220
Will is interfering with my own free

1329
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:58,680
will

1330
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,140
this has no judgment upon Kinesiology or

1331
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,119
not or acupuncture or naturopathy or

1332
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,920
whatever it is that's out there or any

1333
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,300
kind of other natural means of of

1334
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,040
healing or anything that's not what this

1335
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,480
is I'm not pulling opinions and

1336
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,420
judgments on it

1337
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,920
I'm just saying that the difference is

1338
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,420
someone

1339
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,160
Spirit of compassion was saying someone

1340
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,660
was thinking Kinesiology I'm like no

1341
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,760
that's when someone else's Free Will

1342
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:24,119
interferes with your free will

1343
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,619
and tries to control your free will

1344
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,059
I'm not saying that in a bad way I'm

1345
00:54:25,619 --> 00:54:29,880
just saying that that's involved that's

1346
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:31,380
how it works this is your own no one's

1347
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,780
interfering

1348
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,140
this is continuity between

1349
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:38,760
Me Myself and I

1350
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:41,579
my soul

1351
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,140
which resides here my subconscious mind

1352
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:46,680
my conscious mind

1353
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:48,480
my physical brain and the product here

1354
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,740
now if you're

1355
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,480
depending on your left hand or

1356
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:53,839
right-handed you can go either way and

1357
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,839
do it

1358
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,980
it's one of the reasons why originally I

1359
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,319
first recommended

1360
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,619
the number two products by the way

1361
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:09,900
right from years ago

1362
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,760
because of that right there insulin's

1363
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,700
like what the heck and then I had asked

1364
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,559
questions why is it so good like why is

1365
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,359
the continuity so good so let's go into

1366
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,920
by the way and of course we know why

1367
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:21,660
I've talked about it in the four things

1368
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,520
okay

1369
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,339
so and you guys know I've endorsed them

1370
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:31,160
because of it all so let's go into this

1371
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:31,160
a little bit so why would B12 help us

1372
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,059
intuitively

1373
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,339
because SSC has only always told me

1374
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:41,220
helps us intuitively

1375
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:42,839
it helps us it's a nutrient that helps

1376
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,119
us psychically

1377
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:47,119
it's a nutrient that helps us

1378
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,300
clairvoyantly

1379
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,819
it's a nutrient that helps us

1380
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:58,559
telepathically

1381
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:00,420
if that's what you have

1382
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,640
inside of you

1383
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,260
everybody has a little bit of that some

1384
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,940
people have more some people have less

1385
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,800
some people it's undeveloped some people

1386
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,619
hasn't been developed enough some people

1387
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,859
but everybody has that possibility

1388
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:16,940
or they have it but it's just not

1389
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:16,940
upgraded right

1390
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:25,099
like Spirit of compassion always told me

1391
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,099
I have to take b12.

1392
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:29,040
and I have to take it for years and it's

1393
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,020
not just

1394
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,579
for the good reason to take it but for

1395
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,420
so many other reasons I'm talking about

1396
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:35,420
like that connection

1397
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,400
so anyway

1398
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:43,140
I take it straight I don't even I don't

1399
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:47,000
use it but I take the B12 straight is

1400
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,000
what I do taking a dropper full now

1401
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,920
and that's the other thing like I know

1402
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,619
what resonates and I can feel that

1403
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,700
vibration it's incredible

1404
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:58,260
but

1405
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,520
we covered a lot of things if you just

1406
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,020
got on here

1407
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,579
watch us from the beginning because

1408
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,440
we're covering like the B12 shots a

1409
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:05,220
little bit we're covering B12 testing a

1410
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,500
little bit

1411
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,420
and I talked about doctors experiences

1412
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,220
with that experiences that it that I've

1413
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,020
had with that as well and the

1414
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,660
information I've covered that a little

1415
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:18,660
bit too I've also talked about

1416
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,760
other aspects of B12 and and of course

1417
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:22,559
the production of B12 so if you guys

1418
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,660
just got here there's different topics

1419
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,760
there's different

1420
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:28,440
different things that actually you know

1421
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:31,020
view when you get a chance and watch

1422
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,940
just great information about p12 in

1423
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:35,099
general

1424
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,200
so I'll talk about a couple other little

1425
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:38,819
things that's interesting right B12

1426
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,260
helps

1427
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:46,980
prevent vitamin B12 memory loss which is

1428
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:51,359
pretty awesome so B12 helps to prevent

1429
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:54,300
vitamin B12 memory loss

1430
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,700
which is really awesome

1431
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,579
you know so it helps actually prevent

1432
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,619
vitamin B12 deficiency related memory

1433
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:04,680
loss which is incredible vitamin B12

1434
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,720
helps to support heart health because

1435
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,760
someone was asking me recently and

1436
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,180
they're like what about cardiovascular

1437
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,819
what about heart B12 does help support

1438
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:16,500
heart health

1439
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:18,240
and then you'll see out there if

1440
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,859
somebody would be like yeah B12 puts me

1441
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,260
in a better mood it's because it

1442
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:25,079
promotes a healthy mood

1443
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:28,619
which is incredible too and b12 helps

1444
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:30,480
the body make energy from food

1445
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:31,440
which is awesome so that's the whole

1446
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,540
thing so you got all these people

1447
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,240
they're eating food for energy they're

1448
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:38,599
eating food to create energy but B12

1449
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,839
helps their body

1450
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:45,480
make energy from food so it's actually

1451
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:47,700
something that helps the body make the

1452
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,740
energy from the food itself so you have

1453
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,540
food and what food offers that gives you

1454
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,180
energy but

1455
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,859
the nutrient itself that sits inside of

1456
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,319
us when we take the B12 and we have that

1457
00:58:55,859 --> 00:59:00,599
nutrient in us so we have it in US it

1458
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:03,540
actually helps

1459
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:06,359
energy being produced by that food so I

1460
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:09,500
love that all on its own in B12

1461
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:12,299
so the memory gb12 is the

1462
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,460
methylcobalamin adenosilcobalamin it's

1463
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:18,839
the two coenzymes

1464
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:20,520
and it's balanced in the right way

1465
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:23,819
so I just wanted to run those by you

1466
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:26,819
guys too it's really cool

1467
00:59:23,819 --> 00:59:29,640
David says I want to know too

1468
00:59:26,819 --> 00:59:32,040
always mind blown archangela

1469
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,020
Angelica says

1470
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,819
always mind blown

1471
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,799
amazing it's incredible information

1472
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:39,480
check out the brain saver books when you

1473
00:59:37,799 --> 00:59:41,339
guys get the chance because if there's

1474
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,500
so much B12 information throughout the

1475
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:45,720
book it's something that you might want

1476
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:47,099
to look at when you get a chance I know

1477
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,740
that people have so many questions but

1478
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:52,740
it's like hey get the books too learn

1479
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:54,540
learn from the books there's a reason

1480
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,540
why there's such incredible information

1481
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:00,420
in there so we can actually all learn

1482
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,220
so incredible you guys

1483
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,599
all right so

1484
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,059
I just wanted to give you a little B

1485
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,460
talk B12 talk today because so many of

1486
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,200
you guys ask me all the time and every

1487
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,880
once in a blue moon I don't know if it

1488
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,400
was two years ago I did a B12 talk I

1489
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,960
don't know when it was but it was time

1490
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,260
especially with everything happening

1491
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,720
right now any support we can get when

1492
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,660
times are stressful or anything else and

1493
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,280
quality matters it's another thing too

1494
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:28,980
so what I was telling another doctor

1495
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:31,079
friend that if you go and you use a

1496
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,520
lower quality B12

1497
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,040
it

1498
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,540
isn't really doing Us justice it's

1499
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,520
another thing too

1500
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,520
and then also everything I said about

1501
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:43,260
the four things hidden things in there

1502
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,880
that you know that they don't have to

1503
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:46,140
disclose there's just so many other

1504
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,599
things that just aren't great but

1505
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,280
stressful times of the year right now

1506
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:52,319
too and that doesn't help a lot of

1507
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,059
people are indulging a lot of people are

1508
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:56,180
partying a lot of people try to dumb

1509
01:00:54,059 --> 01:01:00,720
themselves out at this time of year

1510
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:03,359
and no judgment whatsoever on that on

1511
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:06,359
any level like never never ever put

1512
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:09,119
anyone down for what they're eating

1513
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:11,579
ever or or what they're doing or what

1514
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:14,099
they're drinking I never do that I mean

1515
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:16,380
I make jokes about weed and stuff

1516
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,240
you know I know like a lot of people are

1517
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,040
weed smokers and they make you know

1518
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,680
jokes about that whatever and I'm like

1519
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:23,880
yo dudes yeah man I told you I got a

1520
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,260
friend that's still on the couch he's

1521
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,940
been on the couch for 30 years his wife

1522
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,859
left him

1523
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,839
he all he did was smoke weed every day

1524
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:32,720
and she finally just moved out and it's

1525
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:35,160
so sad because they were a great couple

1526
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,059
that that's besides the point anyway

1527
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,520
whatever

1528
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:40,319
and then flu season is here which knocks

1529
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:43,079
us down

1530
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:45,420
so kind of is a good time to talk about

1531
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,900
B12 in general because flu season's here

1532
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,880
and knocks us down all of that stuff

1533
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,099
yeah like you know my friend Bryce right

1534
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,960
you guys know my friend Bryce

1535
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,299
Bryce it's a big weed smoker right

1536
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,520
remember I had Bryce on here remember I

1537
01:01:57,299 --> 01:02:01,799
was busy I was you know I was outside

1538
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,480
and Bryce came in here and he started

1539
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:04,920
working with you guys

1540
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:08,240
yeah

1541
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,240
Chris it says make sense

1542
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,140
anyway don't judge anybody for what they

1543
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:15,599
do regardless of what they do

1544
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:18,839
and it's because I know that life is

1545
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,839
hard and everybody's jacked up on

1546
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:23,400
caffeine you try to push through the day

1547
01:02:20,839 --> 01:02:26,700
smoking weed to try to like you know

1548
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,740
blow off their problems and do an

1549
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,079
Ayahuasca because you know they're told

1550
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,119
that it's good for you oh my God

1551
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:35,280
which is not it's not good for you

1552
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:37,020
either way I don't judge anybody I'm

1553
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,400
just saying that there are things we can

1554
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,200
do to support ourselves through

1555
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,540
different difficult times and everything

1556
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:44,819
else

1557
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:46,260
good Erica true wash it unless you grew

1558
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:48,839
