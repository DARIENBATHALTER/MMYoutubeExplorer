instead they think that everybody has

116
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,240
good in them and that people are just

117
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,240
misguided people also believe that

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,919
news something you see out there in the

127
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,960
media where how did these people burn up

128
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,840
alive in a car how come they just

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,840
couldn't get out of the car what

130
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
happened or how did that person run

131
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,840
themselves over they were getting out of

132
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,800
the car it rolled backwards dragged them

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,960
along the way ran over them but how they

134
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,360
weren't looking for that to happen that

135
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,280
day everybody was happy things were

136
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,000
going good how is this possible they

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,960
woke up that morning they took a shower

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,360
brushed their teeth they had a bagel

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,759
they had a drink of orange juice hour

140
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,680
later they were dead they were run over

141
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,720
by their own car a freak accident and

142
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,680
why do we make choices that aren't the

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,240
best for us how does that work someone's

144
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
young they're in college they're

145
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,639
drinking too much they get alcohol

146
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,720
poisoning they leave the party or they

147
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,919
leave the bar they're walking down the

148
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,639
street talking to themselves they're

149
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,759
walking around aimlessly they walk down

150
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,240
a different street cameras last see them

151
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,879
here cameras last see them there they

152
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,680
disappear nobody could find them 20 days

153
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,680
later they're found in a river nothing

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,720
makes sense what soever there was no

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,560
reason for it and what about

156
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,960
relationships gone wrong toxic

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,000
relationships but why are they toxic to

158
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,840
begin with is it just baggage is it old

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,360
hurt Old Wounds and where did that old

160
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,240
hurt and Old Wounds deriv from where did

161
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,639
they come from why are they there was

162
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,720
there any kind of other influence

163
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,680
involved and why do people do dark

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,560
things dark things things that aren't

165
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,680
good for them things that aren't good

166
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,479
for others around them things that were

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,639
premeditated things that were

168
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,080
spontaneous things that were hurtful but

169
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,800
they didn't really mean it and then

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,039
there's people out there that hurt

171
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,720
others that mean it what is this all

172
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,440
about so many people out there live in a

173
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,840
bubble where the thought of Darkness

174
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,800
existing is only meant for the movies

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,039
for television they believe when things

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,599
happen to people in real life they

177
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,639
brought it upon themselves they caused

178
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,039
it and for those that believe this kind

179
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,360
of thing that when bad things happened

180
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,520
to people they caused it and brought it

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,039
upon themselves maybe the worst they've

182
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,960
ever experienced so far in life was a

183
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,360
girlfriend or a boyfriend cheating on

184
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,879
them and that was it or a family member

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,400
that they didn't get along good with

186
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,440
well these things can still cause

187
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,840
injuries and not be great people think

188
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,080
that Darkness plays no role in any of it

189
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,800
that it just happened because people are

190
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,279
people and yes people can be people but

191
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,000
there is something to be said that

192
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,519
darkness is involved with so many issues

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,760
toxic relationships Darkness can be

194
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,240
involved and it doesn't mean that the

195
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,800
people in the relationship are bad but

196
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,320
they could be influenced yes influenced

197
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,079
by dark Fallen beings demonic beings

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,440
inherently involved D in so many of

199
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,600
their issues and to the people that live

200
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,079
in a bubble the thought of demonic and

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,560
Fallen beings inherently involved in so

202
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,519
many of the world's problems seems way

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,200
way overreaching and totally not any

204
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,839
kind of reality you would think humans

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,279
would be elevated at this point at a

206
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,959
place in time and history where we know

207
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,360
that hate and destruction and war is not

208
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,440
productive and you would think at this

209
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,040
point in time in history

210
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,760
people would actually not do terrible

211
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,920
things that institutions wouldn't do

212
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
Terrible Things countries wouldn't do

213
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
terrible things you would think that

214
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,120
everybody would just get along and

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,440
everybody would try to make good things

216
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,079
happen only but how come it doesn't work

217
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,480
that way why are we witnessing so much

218
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:54,720
constant chaos and destruction and

219
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,680
wrongful death why in our everyday lives

220
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,920
do we experience so many heartaches so

221
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,000
much red tape that thwarts are dreams

222
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,720
and why are there so many unstable

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,800
people out there people that create

224
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,560
nothing but static and

225
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,519
confusion some people that like creating

226
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,200
confusion some people that just don't

227
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,800
know they're creating that much

228
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,680
confusion why do people who work so hard

229
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,600
at manifestation still get foiled still

230
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,240
get thrown off their path when you hear

231
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,640
the word demon how do you feel what kind

232
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,440
of reactions do you have have what kind

233
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,360
of reactions do other people have for

234
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,000
some people they just don't like the

235
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,240
sound of the word the word itself scares

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,040
them for some people it gives them a

237
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,240
creepy crawly sensation a funny feeling

238
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,320
for some people they're worried they're

239
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,040
superstitious they think it's dangerous

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
to say the word demon and they think

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,839
they're bringing it to them just saying

242
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,519
the word itself that's a problem maybe

243
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,880
they're going to bring a demon to them

244
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,040
to cause problem albums and then there's

245
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:09,160
folklore demon stories out there demon

246
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:12,480
stories in films demons in film Seance

247
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,959
boards the idea if you actually talk

248
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,200
about something you bring it to yourself

249
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,120
if you entertain the idea you bring it

250
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,959
upon

251
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,680
yourself now I'm not here to convince

252
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,360
anyone that demons exist you can believe

253
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,399
in demons or you don't have to believe

254
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,959
in demons they would prefer you don't

255
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,399
believe in them Darkness would prefer

256
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,720
you don't believe in Darkness Darkness

257
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,639
would rather have the experiences in

258
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,320
someone's life that are not agreeable to

259
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,160
be blamed on people blamed even on them

260
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,519
or maybe happen stance or freak

261
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,040
accidents instead of anybody thinking

262
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,360
about the possibility that demonic

263
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,240
forces exist if someone avoids thinking

264
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,800
about

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,800
demons does that protect them are you

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,079
more susceptible to Demons when you

267
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,240
focus on them being real is it unhealthy

268
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:11,079
to think about the possibility of demons

269
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:14,680
being real no it's not this isn't like

270
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:17,639
Beetle Juice or if you say demons three

271
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,279
times you're in trouble Dark Forces out

272
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,839
there are at play no matter what they're

273
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,839
at play out there and you can witness

274
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,959
these dark Forces you could see it out

275
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,880
there every day if not in your own

276
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,480
personal life can witness what's

277
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,079
happening in with planetary politics

278
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,680
Earthly destruction and throughout the

279
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,639
decades lots of innocent people dying

280
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,240
then there are the constant coverups out

281
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:45,320
there so the darkness can be hidden and

282
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,120
the truth doesn't show many coverups

283
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,720
that the light never shines upon and

284
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,720
some that surface over time demonic

285
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,399
forces play a role in it all they're

286
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,720
always trying to tempt people to mess

287
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,600
with people's heads and many people

288
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,320
carry one or even multiple demons around

289
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,279
them or with them or sometimes in them

290
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,440
people who suffer from addiction issues

291
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,120
can be taunted by demons even long after

292
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
an addiction has been healed conquered

293
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,920
or

294
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,440
defeated the person who defeated that

295
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,560
addiction who won over that addiction

296
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,720
and moved forward still can be taunted

297
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,120
every now and then still can be teased

298
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,600
every now and then still feel an UR

299
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
merge every now and then on an emotional

300
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,120
level and when they overpowered that

301
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,760
addiction with their free will they

302
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,880
overpowered that demon the Demon's

303
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:45,279
influence the darkness' influence they

304
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,560
overpowered it doesn't mean that demon

305
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,519
won't come along one day when they're at

306
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,000
a weak moment when they've been chipped

307
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,120
away when they've been beaten down by

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,639
something by some other demonic force in

309
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,000

relationship with them that has demons

in some form shape or in some way and

314
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,000
that demon starts to chip away at them

315
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,279
starts to tempt them when they're in

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,880
their darkest hour for the moment or

317
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,680

you in all these decades I've been asked

356
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:15,399
about demons asked about the afterlife

357
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:17,880
asked about ghosts asked about spirits

358
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,639
asked about angels and the most

359
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,480
inquiries I get are about demons what's

360
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,560
going on with demons what's the whole

361
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,959
demon

362
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:33,199
thing how does that work or demons even

363
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:36,399
been real along the way I would shed

364
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,160
some light on fragments of the inner

365
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,720
workings of the spiritual realm and what

366
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,000
seemed to be meaningless

367
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,839
atrocities until now I've been holding

368
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,120
back lots of spiritual information

369
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:54,480
because the hands of time had not

370

have to be obsessed with it you don't

377
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,199
have to think about demons

378
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,000
24/7 or think about their possibility of

379
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,640
existing all the time you don't have to

380
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,919
live like that you can just be aware

381
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,280
that when things are going wrong it's

382
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,880
not because of you it's not your fault

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,200
you're not the reason why things are

384
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,039
going wrong there are other things at

385
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:42,039
hand and that's when we use the light of

386
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:45,200
God we call upon the angels we learn how

387
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:48,799
to protect ourselves we finally become

388
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
aware and that awareness is powerful

389
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,919
it's

390
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,440
Unstoppable that awareness pushes demons

391
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,440
away helps to conquer demons that

392
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,679
awareness is awareness that God

393
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,559
the angels are aware of as well they

394
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,679
