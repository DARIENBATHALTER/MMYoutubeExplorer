[38.34 - 42.66] hopefully that doesn't get anybody upset
[40.44 - 44.70] like why is he eating oatmeal cookies
[42.66 - 47.34] tonight for his dinner
[44.70 - 49.86] is that bad what's the medical medium
[47.34 - 52.50] eating what's he doing
[49.86 - 54.72] maybe he's not doing good he's eating
[52.50 - 58.58] this this is great though I got some
[54.72 - 58.58] raisins right here I'll show you guys
[59.64 - 63.78] some oatmeal
[62.04 - 65.04] I'm gonna move this out of the way if
[63.78 - 68.10] you guys are okay with that I'm gonna
[65.04 - 72.08] let this steep a little bit
[68.10 - 75.00] some nice tea with honey in it okay and
[72.08 - 77.64] I have the gluten-free banana oat
[75.00 - 79.92] breakfast cookies right here
[77.64 - 82.86] there we go it's right out of cleanse
[79.92 - 87.02] the heel that's what I'm doing how is it
[82.86 - 87.02] going with your Stones The Journey
[87.66 - 91.26] today did you walk with your Stones
[89.52 - 93.90] walking meditation with your Stones
[91.26 - 96.90] where are my Stones right here took a
[93.90 - 98.64] walk today with my stones
[96.90 - 101.10] right are you putting them on the
[98.64 - 103.08] windowsill are you letting your Stones
[101.10 - 104.64] get some light on them through the
[103.08 - 106.74] window are you looking through the
[104.64 - 109.80] window while you have your Stones when
[106.74 - 112.74] we look through the window
[109.80 - 115.02] regardless of what scenery is on the
[112.74 - 116.76] outside of that window if we look
[115.02 - 118.74] through the window
[116.76 - 120.06] something happens here with our neurons
[118.74 - 121.92] something happens with the emotional
[120.06 - 125.28] centers of our brain
[121.92 - 128.28] all kinds of Memories We don't even pick
[125.28 - 129.66] up on that are circulating through old
[128.28 - 131.64] memories that are in there that we're
[129.66 - 134.52] not grabbing onto
[131.64 - 136.68] all kinds of connections occur there's
[134.52 - 141.00] something when
[136.68 - 143.16] a human being looks through a window
[141.00 - 145.14] something happens
[143.16 - 147.24] something we can't measure something
[145.14 - 150.24] people cannot understand out there
[147.24 - 152.16] science doesn't understand and when we
[150.24 - 155.40] look through a window and we see things
[152.16 - 158.22] we see birds we see trees we see grass
[155.40 - 160.32] we see buildings we see sidewalks
[158.22 - 162.24] whatever it is we see cars when we look
[160.32 - 163.62] through a window something happens a
[162.24 - 165.60] connection is made and then the
[163.62 - 169.26] emotional centers of the brain
[165.60 - 172.56] starts to tick and starts to tick and
[169.26 - 175.14] information starts to pour out of your
[172.56 - 177.30] being and into the stones if it
[175.14 - 179.16] shouldn't be there
[177.30 - 180.78] a lot of people have experiences where
[179.16 - 182.34] they look out windows because they were
[180.78 - 183.78] depressed they had something happen in
[182.34 - 186.24] their life maybe they had some kind of
[183.78 - 187.68] disturbance maybe they had some kind of
[186.24 - 190.08] abuse maybe they went through a hard
[187.68 - 193.08] time maybe they had losses and it takes
[190.08 - 195.30] us to the window and we look out the
[193.08 - 198.42] window it takes us to the window in our
[195.30 - 201.24] life how many times have we looked out
[198.42 - 202.62] the window when the relationship breaks
[201.24 - 204.84] at breakups with all kinds of
[202.62 - 206.40] confrontations in life being bullied
[204.84 - 207.66] whatever it is that's happened in our
[206.40 - 210.30] life
[207.66 - 212.82] we get kind of taken to the window
[210.30 - 214.80] and we look out
[212.82 - 216.18] and there's a reason for this lots of
[214.80 - 217.50] reasons for that so the emotional
[216.18 - 218.82] centers of the brain has all this
[217.50 - 221.40] information
[218.82 - 223.86] regarding when we actually look out
[221.40 - 226.02] windows
[223.86 - 228.00] it's important is important to know so
[226.02 - 229.64] when you put the stones there by the
[228.00 - 231.90] windowsill and you look out the window
[229.64 - 233.70] the emotion centers of the brain are
[231.90 - 234.96] connecting to our soul and so forth and
[233.70 - 237.54] all that I'll talk about that more and
[234.96 - 240.00] other things I'm making these banana oat
[237.54 - 242.10] breakfast cookies as I showed you before
[240.00 - 244.92] I got my raisins I got everything right
[242.10 - 247.80] here two bananas first that's what we're
[244.92 - 249.18] gonna do two bananas first
[247.80 - 252.18] so
[249.18 - 254.28] here we are let's get my little Mixing
[252.18 - 256.86] Bowl here
[254.28 - 260.10] this is what I felt like eating for
[256.86 - 261.36] dinner tonight it was these have you
[260.10 - 262.56] ever tried these have you ever made
[261.36 - 263.70] these these that are out of cleanse to

[281.04 - 283.98] just putting a little extra piece right
[282.78 - 285.84] there
[283.98 - 288.36] Uma says I think my favorite thing is to
[285.84 - 291.12] read with my Stones I love to read with
[288.36 - 292.62] my Stones too you guys don't mind I'm
[291.12 - 294.92] just gonna give these a little bit of a
[292.62 - 294.92] mash
[295.20 - 301.02] I like this recipe because it's really
[297.36 - 302.70] easy it tastes really good Gail Stewart
[301.02 - 305.40] not says it looks like breakfast cookies
[302.70 - 307.38] I've made them indeed it's breast
[305.40 - 308.70] breakfast cookies and indeed and here's
[307.38 - 312.60] the funny thing
[308.70 - 315.42] the funny thing about this right
[312.60 - 317.90] is it's breakfast but it's not breakfast
[315.42 - 317.90] here
[318.00 - 322.10] it's not break fast here
[323.82 - 328.98] no it is not
[326.22 - 331.98] it's dinner time
[328.98 - 335.16] but it's it's perfect though feels good
[331.98 - 338.84] right now processing a lot of emotions a
[335.16 - 338.84] lot of emotions leaving the body
[338.94 - 342.32] lots of Old Wounds
[342.36 - 345.78] leaving the body leaving the soul
[344.46 - 349.80] leaving
[345.78 - 353.64] are being lots of wounds
[349.80 - 354.84] felt like making a breakfast
[353.64 - 359.78] you know what I like about this
[354.84 - 359.78] breakfast it's a baked good we're baking
[360.18 - 364.02] the funny thing about medical medium
[361.98 - 366.06] information there's more baked goods and
[364.02 - 368.70] medical medium information
[366.06 - 371.60] it's insane it's like a whole website
[368.70 - 371.60] you filled with them
[372.54 - 378.44] crazy how much
[375.18 - 378.44] anyway okay
[378.54 - 381.96] all right
[380.04 - 383.58] we're making these cookies really
[381.96 - 385.38] excited about this
[383.58 - 387.60] what I like about these cookies can I
[385.38 - 391.38] just add this I know what's at the end
[387.60 - 394.08] of the day it's evening for many of us
[391.38 - 396.48] so it's a different kind of vibe a more
[394.08 - 397.68] relaxed it's not that afternoon Vibe
[396.48 - 400.98] right
[397.68 - 403.70] so let me get two cups
[400.98 - 403.70] of
[403.74 - 409.64] some gluten-free oats let's get two cups
[406.50 - 409.64] rolled oats
[409.68 - 415.44] instant oats whatever you want to do
[412.62 - 417.48] it's one cup let me get another cup what
[415.44 - 419.04] I like about this there's no lard in
[417.48 - 422.34] here
[419.04 - 425.52] isn't that nice no lard
[422.34 - 428.04] there's no pork fat
[425.52 - 431.28] there's no bad oil in here there's no
[428.04 - 433.20] corn oil there's no bad vegetable oil in
[431.28 - 434.70] here either
[433.20 - 438.26] all right
[434.70 - 438.26] let's get some cinnamon in here
[440.10 - 443.96] looking for my cinnamon hold on
[445.80 - 448.52] we're live
[448.74 - 453.50] we're actually live let's go with two
[450.90 - 453.50] teaspoons
[454.50 - 459.30] two teaspoons
[457.02 - 461.46] boom right there
[459.30 - 463.32] half cup of raisins skip that in there
[461.46 - 466.32] let's get these baking
[463.32 - 468.66] and then we can talk
[466.32 - 470.64] how are my Stones doing are you guys
[468.66 - 472.62] eating with your Stones I'm doing all my
[470.64 - 474.86] meals with the stones I'm eating with my
[472.62 - 474.86] stones
[475.02 - 479.78] we got the cinnamon in here let's mix
[477.36 - 479.78] that up
[481.48 - 484.74] [Music]
[486.90 - 490.70] we need a half cup of raisins
[496.20 - 500.18] I'm gonna throw these in here just like
[497.94 - 500.18] this
[502.62 - 505.58] so there's no
[507.48 - 513.50] there's no uh
[510.30 - 513.50] swine in here
[514.76 - 518.78] there's no pig fat in here
[520.08 - 525.12] friend of mine makes
[522.24 - 528.36] some baked goods and
[525.12 - 531.24] puts anything in there
[528.36 - 532.74] imagine he's still a friend of mine
[531.24 - 533.88] I think the medical medium would say
[532.74 - 537.20] you're not a friend of mine anymore
[533.88 - 537.20] because of what you eat
[538.10 - 542.24] but that's not how it rolls
[545.58 - 549.90] that doesn't depict
[547.80 - 553.34] if you're
[549.90 - 553.34] a good Soul or not
[555.96 - 560.70] so I'm just mixing this up we're pretty
[558.54 - 562.94] much almost there I'm gonna make these
[560.70 - 562.94] cookies
[563.94 - 567.06] there we go
[565.38 - 569.16] let's make sure these are moist enough
[567.06 - 571.02] and I think it's the recipe was just
[569.16 - 573.26] perfect right there
[571.02 - 575.76] sometimes your bananas they might not be
[573.26 - 577.86] as soft
[575.76 - 580.02] or as ripe
[577.86 - 583.46] these happen to be that perfect ripeness
[580.02 - 583.46] when you're doing some baking
[584.16 - 590.36] I just want to make sure these oats get
[586.74 - 590.36] the attention they deserve
[594.00 - 598.08] you guys how are you holding up how are
[596.10 - 599.82] you doing through this transformation
[598.08 - 602.16] day five of the collecting Stones
[599.82 - 604.88] meditation Journey
[602.16 - 604.88] there we go
[608.34 - 613.46] I'm gonna make some cookies
[610.38 - 613.46] I think so
[618.12 - 623.48] you don't have to make them too big you
[620.10 - 623.48] don't have to make them too small
[631.20 - 636.80] you can make them any way you want
[634.02 - 636.80] how about that
[639.00 - 644.28] there isn't any big rules here
[642.36 - 645.66] whatever feels good on this you can make
[644.28 - 647.52] one I don't know I wouldn't do I
[645.66 - 649.98] probably wouldn't make one big massive
[647.52 - 651.66] cookie there we go just want to shake
[649.98 - 654.38] the cookie up a little bit get another
[651.66 - 654.38] pan here
[655.14 - 657.98] there we go
[658.08 - 660.68] nice
[661.22 - 667.34] small cookies are fun
[663.72 - 667.34] I like them a little bigger
[677.28 - 684.18] here we go
[679.56 - 685.86] whoa Tara says over there on YouTube I
[684.18 - 687.78] feel better since I started this
[685.86 - 690.00] meditation
[687.78 - 692.94] this is like a meditation all on its own
[690.00 - 694.32] right here just making these feels
[692.94 - 697.44] really good
[694.32 - 700.44] feels really nice
[697.44 - 703.44] had a good day today
[700.44 - 706.62] it's like you know what I'm gonna
[703.44 - 709.26] bake some cookies tonight I mean I
[706.62 - 712.86] actually do
[709.26 - 715.64] like sometimes something just like this
[712.86 - 715.64] at night
[716.22 - 719.90] for dinner what about you guys
[723.30 - 726.60] you know what I like about these cookies
[724.80 - 730.62] here
[726.60 - 731.76] I didn't have to put any eggs in here
[730.62 - 734.34] because you know medical medium
[731.76 - 738.20] information is the first that ever put
[734.34 - 738.20] out that eggs feed pathogens
[739.74 - 747.18] it was not known in the Health world or
[743.10 - 749.52] medical world the pathogens ate anything
[747.18 - 751.26] at all
[749.52 - 752.94] but then you see people now saying it
[751.26 - 754.50] even though science hasn't even proved
[752.94 - 757.10] it yet or anything but you see people
[754.50 - 757.10] saying it
[757.92 - 764.30] where they get that info from oh
[760.86 - 764.30] medical medium information
[764.36 - 768.68] all right you guys we're day five
[770.34 - 777.00] anyway I like doing baked goods without
[774.06 - 778.38] eggs in them I'm not saying look I'm not
[777.00 - 779.94] saying if you like eggs and that's what
[778.38 - 781.50] you do it's fine but if you got chronic
[779.94 - 783.92] illness if you're struggling in with
[781.50 - 788.34] anything if you're dealing with anything
[783.92 - 790.86] health-wise it's good to keep them out
[788.34 - 794.00] and this is a great recipe
[790.86 - 794.00] a great recipe
[799.28 - 805.04] indeed indeed
[802.14 - 805.04] all right so
[806.04 - 810.02] I'm making these the size that I want
[810.30 - 814.58] to make it smaller to make them bigger
[819.12 - 821.78] there we go
[829.32 - 833.30] so good so good with raisins
[833.58 - 837.50] any of you guys raising fans
[838.50 - 844.98] now day five
[841.56 - 847.56] we have day six and we have day seven
[844.98 - 849.30] I hear some of you guys don't want to
[847.56 - 850.86] let your Stones go
[849.30 - 854.72] already
[850.86 - 854.72] or you're worried about letting them go
[855.00 - 858.96] it's part of the process it's part of
[856.92 - 861.26] the healing process it's part of the
[858.96 - 861.26] exercise
[861.66 - 864.62] letting them go
[866.82 - 870.62] sending them back into nature
[871.86 - 875.96] so nature can diffuse
[876.42 - 879.20] the bomb
[882.24 - 885.54] yeah
[883.62 - 889.02] of emotions
[885.54 - 893.84] of hurt of Old Wounds store deep inside
[889.02 - 893.84] so nature can diffuse
[897.54 - 900.20] IG
[900.62 - 907.76] roanzin says Anthony I'm finally healed
[904.32 - 907.76] from eczema and acne
[909.36 - 916.28] that's what it's all about
[912.02 - 916.28] that's what it's all about
[917.40 - 924.30] that's why we do this
[920.40 - 925.62] Deb says took my stones on my girl's
[924.30 - 927.84] weekend
[925.62 - 931.44] fantastic
[927.84 - 932.82] the best news I ever heard as well
[931.44 - 935.34] because you don't want to leave your
[932.82 - 937.26] Stones behind you want to take them with
[935.34 - 938.94] you you don't want to leave them behind
[937.26 - 942.38] where they're just
[938.94 - 942.38] all Left Behind
[943.02 - 946.50] you're gonna be on your trip and you're
[944.52 - 947.76] gonna be like well my stones are back
[946.50 - 948.96] there
[947.76 - 951.96] at
[948.96 - 954.42] my house or back there at my apartment
[951.96 - 955.58] back there at home
[954.42 - 958.26] all right
[955.58 - 960.48] I think this is really really worked out
[958.26 - 962.16] we got a kind of a little bit of a

[1014.18 - 1020.18] gluten-free banana oat breakfast cookies
[1016.58 - 1022.70] you can add dried wild blueberries or
[1020.18 - 1025.70] chopped dates or cranberries those are
[1022.70 - 1027.86] options cranberries make sure though the
[1025.70 - 1029.96] cranberries have no added oils because
[1027.86 - 1032.06] it might not be a good oil at all and
[1029.96 - 1034.34] you don't need to have that
[1032.06 - 1036.32] might be a canola oil or something which
[1034.34 - 1038.74] we don't want to use so these are going
[1036.32 - 1038.74] in the oven
[1043.76 - 1049.16] for 350.
[1046.70 - 1052.04] let's see what we can do
[1049.16 - 1054.68] oven set for three
[1052.04 - 1056.44] 50.

[1061.82 - 1065.86] reading good to see you guys
[1078.74 - 1083.36] can IG
[1080.36 - 1086.24] sunlit says just put mine on the
[1083.36 - 1087.38] windowsill it's Sunset perfect time to
[1086.24 - 1089.48] do so
[1087.38 - 1092.74] putting your stones on the windowsill
[1089.48 - 1092.74] great time
[1097.10 - 1100.52] people looked out the window and they
[1098.90 - 1104.30] were at work
[1100.52 - 1106.82] maybe at an office or some workplace
[1104.30 - 1109.10] and they just stared out the window
[1106.82 - 1110.60] you guys we are currently on day five of
[1109.10 - 1112.64] the collecting Stones meditation Journey
[1110.60 - 1114.74] you can sign up at Link at the link
[1112.64 - 1116.84] right there in the profile and Link in
[1114.74 - 1119.36] the bio Link in the description you can
[1116.84 - 1121.04] sign up for all those in those
[1119.36 - 1122.18] how many times have we looked out the
[1121.04 - 1124.76] window
[1122.18 - 1125.78] when we were just contemplating think
[1124.76 - 1127.52] about that right there just
[1125.78 - 1129.02] contemplating
[1127.52 - 1131.42] have you ever looked out the window and
[1129.02 - 1133.94] you're just contemplating
[1131.42 - 1135.50] and you're looking out the window
[1133.94 - 1136.76] how many times have you looked out the
[1135.50 - 1139.16] window because you're having a bad day
[1136.76 - 1140.48] you were having you were having a
[1139.16 - 1141.80] stressful moment in your life a
[1140.48 - 1144.32] stressful day
[1141.80 - 1147.02] and something just took you over to the
[1144.32 - 1149.00] window to look out the window how many
[1147.02 - 1150.38] of you had that where you're looking out
[1149.00 - 1151.58] the window because you're having a hard
[1150.38 - 1153.26] day
[1151.58 - 1155.00] how many people look out the window
[1153.26 - 1156.80] because they want to see what's going on
[1155.00 - 1159.62] outside no matter what and it's a part
[1156.80 - 1161.78] of their routine so it's part of their
[1159.62 - 1164.90] routine to look out the window look at
[1161.78 - 1168.58] hummingbirds look at birds look at just
[1164.90 - 1168.58] anything going on out there
[1168.86 - 1173.36] look at the trees
[1171.08 - 1175.64] how many people look out the window when
[1173.36 - 1177.68] it rains you have a rainy day and
[1175.64 - 1179.00] something kind of comes over you and you
[1177.68 - 1182.60] feel
[1179.00 - 1185.42] a little sad you just
[1182.60 - 1187.22] you want to go to the window
[1185.42 - 1189.46] Courtney says I feel trapped inside of
[1187.22 - 1189.46] work
[1191.60 - 1199.36] since he's just looking out
[1194.72 - 1199.36] Tristan Marie says it's my daily routine
[1201.32 - 1203.92] what happens when
[1206.60 - 1213.58] pathways are accessed
[1209.42 - 1213.58] that we don't normally have access to
[1213.74 - 1216.38] so
[1214.82 - 1218.36] basically a channel opens up
[1216.38 - 1220.16] automatically emotional centers of the
[1218.36 - 1224.12] brain connect to other areas of the
[1220.16 - 1228.62] brain meaning the non-emotional areas
[1224.12 - 1230.78] information is trans transferred
[1228.62 - 1232.46] sometimes we get Nostalgia when we're
[1230.78 - 1233.72] looking out windows sometimes we get big
[1232.46 - 1237.14] ideas
[1233.72 - 1239.06] great ideas sometimes we get
[1237.14 - 1241.52] memories
[1239.06 - 1243.20] but either way Windows play a big part
[1241.52 - 1245.54] that's part of the whole windowsill
[1243.20 - 1248.50] stones on the windowsill with you while
[1245.54 - 1248.50] you're looking out the window
[1249.14 - 1251.98] on day five
[1252.56 - 1256.10] Boston says where can I find this P
[1254.42 - 1257.84] would love to tell you it's cleansed to
[1256.10 - 1259.40] heal if you don't have this book you're
[1257.84 - 1261.08] missing out
[1259.40 - 1263.30] by far one of the greatest medical
[1261.08 - 1266.60] textbook out there for people to get
[1263.30 - 1269.18] their lives back this book this book
[1266.60 - 1271.16] I will commend this book
[1269.18 - 1273.86] this book has healed so many people
[1271.16 - 1276.32] around the world and saved so many lives
[1273.86 - 1278.50] and very proud of this book soc's
[1276.32 - 1278.50] information
[1279.20 - 1283.88] going to page 450 I want to read just a
[1281.84 - 1285.68] little bit just for fun
[1283.88 - 1287.54] anywhere you open up the medical medium
[1285.68 - 1289.58] books it's just people own away when
[1287.54 - 1290.66] have you opened them up in a while have
[1289.58 - 1293.54] you read
[1290.66 - 1296.00] it's like you've never read it before
[1293.54 - 1298.60] that's what's interesting too cookies
[1296.00 - 1298.60] are baking
[1298.70 - 1304.64] I feel like some big baking tonight
[1302.42 - 1307.52] Jim says hi aw thanks for all you do for
[1304.64 - 1312.22] us could you explain why I'm sensitive
[1307.52 - 1312.22] to a heated oven I really miss baking
[1312.74 - 1318.32] um beer on detective first of all are
[1314.36 - 1320.00] you sensitive to Pete in general are you
[1318.32 - 1321.74] sensitive to a really hot day because I
[1320.00 - 1323.84] know some people they can't handle a 90
[1321.74 - 1326.66] degree day they can't handle 85 degree
[1323.84 - 1330.62] and humid they can't handle 78 degrees
[1326.66 - 1334.04] anything above 75 degrees
[1330.62 - 1336.98] oven heat is dry dry heat sensitive
[1334.04 - 1338.24] nervous systems don't like super dry
[1336.98 - 1340.88] heat
[1338.24 - 1344.24] so sensitive nervous systems do not like
[1340.88 - 1347.36] super dry heat sensitive sinus cavities
[1344.24 - 1351.02] do not like super dry heat of course
[1347.36 - 1352.46] real humid humid heat is a whole nother
[1351.02 - 1354.44] you know
[1352.46 - 1355.64] irritation for a lot of people on its
[1354.44 - 1358.40] own but I'm talking about dry heat
[1355.64 - 1361.10] coming out of the oven
[1358.40 - 1363.80] when people are struggling they're
[1361.10 - 1366.74] overheated internally overheated too
[1363.80 - 1368.60] they might have a struggling stagnant
[1366.74 - 1370.58] sluggish liver
[1368.60 - 1374.56] and then info
[1370.58 - 1374.56] now taken for granted around the world
[1374.78 - 1379.12] about stagnant and sluggish livers about
[1376.76 - 1379.12] why
[1380.72 - 1384.62] if I don't mention that people be like
[1383.12 - 1386.36] oh he must have got it from this person
[1384.62 - 1387.62] he was got it from that person he must
[1386.36 - 1390.56] have got it from this person no
[1387.62 - 1392.78] originated from the medical me books
[1390.56 - 1394.88] okay I want to read a little if you guys
[1392.78 - 1397.16] are open to it
[1394.88 - 1399.26] Charlotte career says I've been dealing
[1397.16 - 1401.30] with awful heat sensitivity but it's
[1399.26 - 1403.46] slowly getting better with mm info and
[1401.30 - 1405.62] the reason why people have awful heat
[1403.46 - 1407.60] sensitivity for the most part not
[1405.62 - 1410.48] everybody most people have heat
[1407.60 - 1412.22] sensitivity because of a sensitive
[1410.48 - 1414.32] central nervous system sensitive central
[1412.22 - 1417.76] nervous system and sensitive cranial
[1414.32 - 1417.76] nerves that's a big one right there
[1419.18 - 1425.12] sensitive cranial nerves
[1422.72 - 1426.74] big one right there all the cranial
[1425.12 - 1428.48] nerves
[1426.74 - 1430.64] when people have those sensitive cranial
[1428.48 - 1432.98] nerves what happens is insensitive vagus
[1430.64 - 1434.90] nerve
[1432.98 - 1435.98] sensitive vagus nerves the cranial
[1434.90 - 1438.02] nerves
[1435.98 - 1439.94] people have issues with that then they
[1438.02 - 1441.68] get heat sensitive they're sensitive to
[1439.94 - 1444.32] the heat outside they're sensitive to a
[1441.68 - 1447.26] lot of sun sensitive to heat sensitive
[1444.32 - 1450.92] to ovens they're sensitive to stoves
[1447.26 - 1453.70] they're just sensitive to a lot of heat
[1450.92 - 1453.70] that's a noise
[1453.92 - 1458.90] Compton says where can I get the
[1456.20 - 1460.64] information about the stone so what you
[1458.90 - 1462.32] want to do is sign up to the collecting
[1460.64 - 1464.60] Stones meditation Journey link is in
[1462.32 - 1466.58] profile link is in description you can
[1464.60 - 1471.16] get the original information which is
[1466.58 - 1471.16] really important in medical medium
[1471.26 - 1476.30] right here the meditation is in this
[1473.78 - 1480.32] book if you don't have this book
[1476.30 - 1482.60] that is also a bummer this book has
[1480.32 - 1485.62] saved lives all around the world
[1482.60 - 1485.62] countless lives
[1489.74 - 1493.82] be kind to yourself tear Appleman says
[1492.32 - 1495.44] heat sensitivity has been a huge
[1493.82 - 1497.36] struggle for me finally been making
[1495.44 - 1499.52] progress healing the symptom with
[1497.36 - 1501.56] medical medium info
[1499.52 - 1502.70] that is so amazing and it's been a hot
[1501.56 - 1504.92] summer
[1502.70 - 1506.30] Gail says I love listening to your audio
[1504.92 - 1510.44] chapter
[1506.30 - 1512.18] one from the revised book made me cry
[1510.44 - 1514.28] share it with friends thank you for
[1512.18 - 1515.96] sharing with Friends
[1514.28 - 1519.05] bless you
[1515.96 - 1519.05] [Music]
[1519.08 - 1524.60] Sharon K over there on YouTube says my
[1521.06 - 1526.88] stone found me it came out of nowhere
[1524.60 - 1528.56] very interesting
[1526.88 - 1529.82] profound actually
[1528.56 - 1532.28] found
[1529.82 - 1534.68] what experience that is
[1532.28 - 1537.56] the idea of cutting out foods from your
[1534.68 - 1539.18] diet even for the short space of a mini
[1537.56 - 1541.70] cleanse just say
[1539.18 - 1543.86] can be loaded
[1541.70 - 1547.16] for women especially
[1543.86 - 1551.18] societal messaging has attached shame to
[1547.16 - 1553.34] food choices for far too long
[1551.18 - 1555.94] I've always said that I'm not the food
[1553.34 - 1555.94] police
[1556.22 - 1561.02] medical meme information was the first
[1558.20 - 1564.38] to bring back fruit
[1561.02 - 1565.82] into the world of Health as we speak
[1564.38 - 1568.46] even though there's still a battle
[1565.82 - 1571.46] trying to stop fruit from being in any
[1568.46 - 1574.34] of the health genres
[1571.46 - 1576.44] fruit fear was the big one
[1574.34 - 1578.42] so I spent 30 years trying to break
[1576.44 - 1580.52] fruit fear because fruit was not allowed
[1578.42 - 1581.96] in anybody's diet
[1580.52 - 1584.00] that had anything to do with natural
[1581.96 - 1585.56] health on any level
[1584.00 - 1586.76] and he kind of cleanses any kind of
[1585.56 - 1589.52] Natural Health
[1586.76 - 1591.44] in any way fruit was not allowed and no
[1589.52 - 1593.18] disrespect to all
[1591.44 - 1595.40] frames of
[1593.18 - 1598.34] of the health world everything from
[1595.40 - 1601.04] naturopaths to acupuncturists and so far
[1598.34 - 1602.72] so so forth like acupuncturist said
[1601.04 - 1604.76] fruit gave you dampness you you're not
[1602.72 - 1606.20] allowed to have it it can't have raw
[1604.76 - 1608.30] fruit like everybody had their thing
[1606.20 - 1610.04] naturopath said too much sugar feeds you
[1608.30 - 1611.78] know Candida
[1610.04 - 1614.60] see
[1611.78 - 1617.24] to Sweet Jane over there
[1614.60 - 1619.10] um I don't mess with any sugar except
[1617.24 - 1622.22] wild blueberries
[1619.10 - 1626.78] fruit today is all GMO despite being
[1622.22 - 1628.58] organic too much sugar well fruit isn't
[1626.78 - 1630.44] GMO
[1628.58 - 1631.70] today I mean but but I'm glad you're
[1630.44 - 1634.16] doing the wild blueberries and no
[1631.70 - 1635.42] disrespect thank you for actually that
[1634.16 - 1636.86] comment because that comment's very
[1635.42 - 1638.54] interesting
[1636.86 - 1641.12] so
[1638.54 - 1643.58] if you're getting like the Honeycrisp
[1641.12 - 1646.34] apple per se that's not GMO
[1643.58 - 1649.90] if you're getting some pairs
[1646.34 - 1653.48] some Bartlett pears that's not GMO so
[1649.90 - 1656.84] bananas are grafted to start with the
[1653.48 - 1658.34] corn that's not GM not corn corn
[1656.84 - 1659.78] this whole thing the banana trees right
[1658.34 - 1662.48] the corns
[1659.78 - 1664.52] that's not GMO
[1662.48 - 1667.84] so it's important to know
[1664.52 - 1667.84] but but but but
[1669.44 - 1674.42] in Hawaii
[1671.24 - 1675.74] I would never eat a papaya there I mean
[1674.42 - 1679.16] of course you can eat a papaya there
[1675.74 - 1682.46] chances are they're GMO
[1679.16 - 1685.64] or serious GMO contamination
[1682.46 - 1688.40] because Hawaii is GMO capital
[1685.64 - 1691.54] literally GMO Capital it's where they
[1688.40 - 1691.54] grow all the medical corn
[1692.30 - 1696.26] is a beautiful place
[1694.58 - 1698.24] but
[1696.26 - 1700.64] beauty also
[1698.24 - 1702.68] another flip side of that there's some
[1700.64 - 1704.36] hidden dark secrets
[1702.68 - 1708.34] and so Hawaii
[1704.36 - 1711.94] is literally the GMO
[1708.34 - 1711.94] Ground Zero
[1713.18 - 1717.68] including every Island
[1715.40 - 1720.02] okay
[1717.68 - 1722.48] but it's still a beautiful place let's
[1720.02 - 1724.34] go a little bit here
[1722.48 - 1726.44] so the idea of cutting out foods for
[1724.34 - 1729.62] your diet even for the short space of a
[1726.44 - 1731.84] mini cleanse is fully loaded a loaded
[1729.62 - 1734.18] topic for women especially societal
[1731.84 - 1737.36] messaging has attached shame to food
[1734.18 - 1739.16] choices for far too long
[1737.36 - 1740.60] I've always said that I'm not the food
[1739.16 - 1743.06] police
[1740.60 - 1744.62] and that will always be true
[1743.06 - 1747.02] remember this when you see a medical
[1744.62 - 1749.36] medium recommendation to limit or
[1747.02 - 1752.06] temporarily cut out a certain food
[1749.36 - 1754.58] that is never attached to judgment on
[1752.06 - 1756.86] any level so there's no judgment
[1754.58 - 1759.20] that's why I have friends
[1756.86 - 1762.32] that just eat what they want
[1759.20 - 1765.80] I did not defriend them
[1762.32 - 1768.38] I did not say you are not my friend I am
[1765.80 - 1771.02] the medical medium
[1768.38 - 1773.84] and how dare you be a friend of mine if
[1771.02 - 1778.06] you're eating an egg how dare you be a
[1773.84 - 1778.06] friend of mine if you're eating whatever
[1778.34 - 1785.38] far from the food police
[1780.44 - 1785.38] so much so far from the food police
[1788.06 - 1792.26] far
[1789.80 - 1793.40] it's unbelievable talk about that
[1792.26 - 1795.98] another time
[1793.40 - 1799.10] Lilly says in IG my daughter back in
[1795.98 - 1801.26] 2015 was listening to you and you healed
[1799.10 - 1802.94] and cleared out her skin explanation
[1801.26 - 1804.74] points thank you so much aw you're
[1802.94 - 1807.64] welcome
[1804.74 - 1807.64] that's your service
[1812.66 - 1815.36] I never judge anybody for what they're
[1814.40 - 1818.06] eating
[1815.36 - 1819.80] never will never have
[1818.06 - 1821.24] I'll never judge them if they're eating
[1819.80 - 1823.52] something in a store that was in a
[1821.24 - 1825.86] package some kind of crazy cupcake with
[1823.52 - 1828.08] some kind of like weird hard white icing
[1825.86 - 1829.34] strip down the center of it I never
[1828.08 - 1832.46] judge them if they're eating some kind
[1829.34 - 1834.20] of crazy fudge cookie in a package
[1832.46 - 1836.00] I never judge them if they're making
[1834.20 - 1838.10] some pancakes and they throw all kinds
[1836.00 - 1840.32] of crap in there and they got bacon on
[1838.10 - 1842.90] the side or anything else like that I
[1840.32 - 1844.40] never forever JoJo you know and that's
[1842.90 - 1847.22] the thing and it's so important to know
[1844.40 - 1849.44] because what happens is that
[1847.22 - 1850.70] it wouldn't be
[1849.44 - 1852.38] Fair
[1850.70 - 1853.88] to anyone
[1852.38 - 1856.04] it just wouldn't
[1853.88 - 1858.50] it wouldn't it's a hard World we're
[1856.04 - 1860.06] raised on certain foods a lot of us
[1858.50 - 1862.10] don't know we don't have the education
[1860.06 - 1864.08] and when we do it's still hard
[1862.10 - 1867.20] Trisha Marie says my conventional doctor
[1864.08 - 1870.14] had me afraid to drink juice or fruit
[1867.20 - 1874.12] smoothies it was disappointing hearing
[1870.14 - 1874.12] that he thought it was bad for the liver
[1874.70 - 1880.88] medical medium information
[1876.98 - 1883.70] was about breaking the fruit fear
[1880.88 - 1886.04] putting the wild blueberries out there
[1883.70 - 1887.42] the messaging the information being a
[1886.04 - 1889.82] messenger about the power of the wild
[1887.42 - 1893.48] blueberries it was about getting fruit
[1889.82 - 1896.48] back into the diet done right
[1893.48 - 1898.94] so people can heal it's not about being
[1896.48 - 1900.80] fruitarian that's not it at all mm info
[1898.94 - 1903.14] isn't about fruit only and only fruit
[1900.80 - 1904.52] and nothing but fruit a mistake I've
[1903.14 - 1906.44] seen out there where people talk about
[1904.52 - 1908.18] quite the contrary
[1906.44 - 1911.42] and then info brought in the leafy
[1908.18 - 1915.02] greens not just the fruit people did not
[1911.42 - 1918.52] eat real leafy greens nor did they treat
[1915.02 - 1918.52] herbs like leafy greens
[1922.40 - 1925.88] and medical medium
[1924.14 - 1929.42] me
[1925.88 - 1932.54] never ever shame someone for eating meat
[1929.42 - 1934.10] quite the contrary I always said you can
[1932.54 - 1936.38] heal while eating meat if you want to be
[1934.10 - 1939.44] a meat eater
[1936.38 - 1941.54] and you can still heal if you
[1939.44 - 1942.80] want to learn the tools and the
[1941.54 - 1944.78] information
[1942.80 - 1947.00] the mm info shows you how to do it while
[1944.78 - 1948.80] eating meat and you can still heal the
[1947.00 - 1950.60] mm info shows you how to do it if you're
[1948.80 - 1952.76] plant-based and never shamed anybody for
[1950.60 - 1956.84] being plant-based ever
[1952.76 - 1959.18] will never did
[1956.84 - 1961.22] nor anybody who was a pescetarian or
[1959.18 - 1962.90] anybody that was a vegetarian or anybody
[1961.22 - 1966.34] who did anything
[1962.90 - 1966.34] because it's not about that
[1968.18 - 1974.30] a medical medium cleanse is never about
[1971.36 - 1977.54] virtuousness virtuousness
[1974.30 - 1981.46] versus shame it's about healings it's
[1977.54 - 1981.46] never about being so virtuous
[1981.80 - 1985.82] right
[1983.54 - 1988.52] it's about healing
[1985.82 - 1992.44] and from a medical perspective
[1988.52 - 1992.44] shame is not healing
[1992.54 - 1998.60] shame releases a harsh adrenaline blend
[1995.72 - 2000.94] that's corrosive and abrasive to our
[1998.60 - 2004.12] neurons our nervous system and can
[2000.94 - 2006.52] weaken our immune system that's what
[2004.12 - 2007.60] that adrenaline from shame is that's why
[2006.52 - 2010.48] we're doing the collective Stones
[2007.60 - 2012.40] meditation too some of our stones are
[2010.48 - 2014.56] named shame I've noticed that people
[2012.40 - 2016.96] name their Stone shame it's incredible
[2014.56 - 2018.46] because what happens is all that stored
[2016.96 - 2020.92] up the wounds and the soul and
[2018.46 - 2023.44] everything based around shame starts to
[2020.92 - 2025.36] funnel out into that stone and that
[2023.44 - 2028.00] Stone's mineral composition is taking it
[2025.36 - 2030.42] in and absorbing it it's eating up that
[2028.00 - 2030.42] shame
[2030.76 - 2035.86] Baghdad says as a nurse I remember the
[2033.94 - 2040.00] first time reading your first book years
[2035.86 - 2043.48] ago and going quote Oh my God this makes
[2040.00 - 2046.92] so much sense so much more sense than
[2043.48 - 2046.92] what I have been taught
[2049.90 - 2054.88] over there on IG
[2051.76 - 2057.70] my mm healing lifestyle and IG says my
[2054.88 - 2061.68] Mom's doctor told her to have
[2057.70 - 2061.68] half a banana only for breakfast
[2065.80 - 2071.20] I'm Doctor
[2067.84 - 2073.24] I'm not just so and so
[2071.20 - 2075.40] I think the phone just I thought I heard
[2073.24 - 2078.78] the phone ringing
[2075.40 - 2078.78] I thought I heard the phone ring
[2079.36 - 2083.20] if you set out with the very best
[2081.04 - 2084.76] intentions
[2083.20 - 2086.80] if you set out with the very best
[2084.76 - 2088.78] intentions for your health and then have
[2086.80 - 2091.60] a terrible stressful day where
[2088.78 - 2093.52] appointment after a appointment ends up
[2091.60 - 2095.56] on your calendar and you get over hungry
[2093.52 - 2097.90] and reach for a food that's outside the
[2095.56 - 2100.48] cleanse because it's sitting right there
[2097.90 - 2103.50] in the break room does that mean that
[2100.48 - 2103.50] you should feel guilty
[2108.16 - 2115.24] hi I'm Dr food shame
[2112.30 - 2118.66] I got the food shame as I recommended
[2115.24 - 2120.22] only eat a little tiny piece of banana
[2118.66 - 2122.86] for breakfast
[2120.22 - 2126.46] I only recommend
[2122.86 - 2127.96] huh I'm not the food please
[2126.46 - 2130.24] no no
[2127.96 - 2133.72] why you hear that in social media about
[2130.24 - 2136.96] the medical medium he's so bad he's
[2133.72 - 2138.64] restricting everybody but I won't let my
[2136.96 - 2139.78] patients have more than a little piece
[2138.64 - 2143.92] of banana
[2139.78 - 2145.90] for breakfast yes Dr food shavier a
[2143.92 - 2146.74] nurse nurse did you just put off the
[2145.90 - 2150.28] line
[2146.74 - 2151.66] yes is this and no more than a little
[2150.28 - 2154.50] piece of banana
[2151.66 - 2154.50] that's all
[2158.20 - 2163.00] Dr Fine many of the high protein gurus
[2160.60 - 2166.24] can't even eat a banana without their
[2163.00 - 2170.04] sugar spiking to 200 to 300 they created
[2166.24 - 2170.04] their own insulin resistance
[2171.34 - 2176.56] they did
[2174.04 - 2178.36] correct
[2176.56 - 2179.40] okay okay okay
[2178.36 - 2183.64] wait wait
[2179.40 - 2186.16] I'm gonna check my cookies
[2183.64 - 2188.50] I have an oven mitt here
[2186.16 - 2192.42] fantastic I'm just making sure they're
[2188.50 - 2192.42] brown they got that nice toasty look
[2195.48 - 2201.28] coming together nice
[2198.40 - 2202.66] they need a couple more minutes
[2201.28 - 2204.90] it's good it's good a couple more
[2202.66 - 2204.90] minutes
[2205.96 - 2209.04] I'm gonna keep this up
[2211.00 - 2214.32] you guys are we having fun
[2215.08 - 2218.52] is I'm having a blast
[2219.28 - 2223.50] I'm trying not to crack myself up though
[2224.32 - 2230.88] Chris Angela says just the laugh I
[2227.02 - 2230.88] needed while on a break at work
[2234.28 - 2241.24] whatever food choice you make at
[2236.92 - 2244.48] whatever time it's not bad or shameful
[2241.24 - 2248.64] it's only that a choice you made and the
[2244.48 - 2248.64] next time you can make another choice
[2249.76 - 2254.68] because food choices outside the
[2252.16 - 2258.46] guidelines of any cleanse
[2254.68 - 2261.30] does it mean you're a bad person doing
[2258.46 - 2261.30] the best you can
[2263.32 - 2267.16] when you eat a food that you know
[2265.24 - 2268.86] doesn't take you closer to feeling
[2267.16 - 2271.42] relief from your symptoms
[2268.86 - 2274.60] self-punishment shouldn't come into the
[2271.42 - 2277.36] picture we should not self-punish
[2274.60 - 2281.50] ourselves we shouldn't
[2277.36 - 2283.12] we shouldn't self-punish ourselves
[2281.50 - 2285.70] it shouldn't come into the picture
[2283.12 - 2288.22] should not
[2285.70 - 2290.68] rather than enter that headspace try to
[2288.22 - 2292.96] remind yourself gently that physically
[2290.68 - 2295.98] the best choice you can make is to be
[2292.96 - 2299.26] kind to yourself being kind to yourself
[2295.98 - 2301.00] really important
[2299.26 - 2304.24] healing
[2301.00 - 2306.52] is not an easy process
[2304.24 - 2308.44] we have to be good to ourselves while
[2306.52 - 2309.88] while we're healing while we're going
[2308.44 - 2311.98] through the process
[2309.88 - 2314.02] while blueberry dreams on IG says yet I
[2311.98 - 2316.90] healed my brain lesion using medical
[2314.02 - 2318.58] medium info incredible
[2316.90 - 2321.58] incredible
[2318.58 - 2323.92] AKA Amy Kelly on IG celery juice
[2321.58 - 2328.68] literally is still saving me thank you
[2323.92 - 2328.68] mm credible info in all the books
[2328.72 - 2333.34] I drink celery juice every day
[2331.30 - 2336.82] I try to drink it every day
[2333.34 - 2338.50] once in a blue moon I'll miss it or I
[2336.82 - 2340.42] don't drink it in the morning I drink it
[2338.50 - 2342.52] at the end of the day it just happens it
[2340.42 - 2346.56] happens I'm not gonna punish myself I'm
[2342.52 - 2346.56] not not gonna flog myself
[2346.60 - 2349.68] I'm not gonna like
[2350.44 - 2355.96] not gonna take a whip and or a strap and
[2353.98 - 2357.82] whap my back
[2355.96 - 2360.60] I'm not gonna do it
[2357.82 - 2360.60] I'm not
[2364.84 - 2368.32] be kind to yourself what does that
[2366.52 - 2370.48] kindness look like it would seem like
[2368.32 - 2373.30] the ultimate triumph over food shame
[2370.48 - 2377.64] would be to eat anything you want at any
[2373.30 - 2377.64] time I wish that were true
[2378.82 - 2383.92] you can do that it's certainly an option
[2380.94 - 2385.60] if your resource is allowed that will
[2383.92 - 2387.52] take you down a route where you end up
[2385.60 - 2389.94] sicker though
[2387.52 - 2392.40] just a reality
[2389.94 - 2395.62] self-compassion looks more like a pause
[2392.40 - 2398.62] whenever you get the impulse to reach
[2395.62 - 2400.42] for a food that isn't part of a cleanse
[2398.62 - 2403.38] or part of what you're doing your
[2400.42 - 2403.38] routine to heal
[2404.74 - 2407.38] so I'm going to check those cookies one
[2406.36 - 2410.88] more time
[2407.38 - 2410.88] are we really talking about cookies
[2412.06 - 2417.46] are we really talking about cookies

[2424.84 - 2430.00] I'm hungry hungry Linda Thomas says I'm
[2428.32 - 2432.04] not a fan of bananas but I certainly
[2430.00 - 2435.06] would make these cookies with banana and
[2432.04 - 2437.98] enjoy them indeed
[2435.06 - 2440.28] I am very excited about these cookies I
[2437.98 - 2440.28] must say
[2441.82 - 2446.98] Cellini says can we have the recipe for
[2444.58 - 2450.04] the cookies please hey W yes you can
[2446.98 - 2454.50] they're in cleanse to heal
[2450.04 - 2454.50] the recipe is oats and banana

[2462.40 - 2465.40] to look at all the recipes that are for
[2464.50 - 2467.74] free

[2471.34 - 2475.18] incredible healing Journey for free
[2472.96 - 2477.04] right now
[2475.18 - 2478.54] don't be a hero can I read this for a
[2477.04 - 2481.26] couple seconds
[2478.54 - 2481.26] couple of minutes
[2482.14 - 2485.50] rewatch this live once it's posted for
[2484.30 - 2487.48] the recipe because that showed the
[2485.50 - 2489.28] recipe already
[2487.48 - 2491.62] another way to show compassion for
[2489.28 - 2493.90] yourself is to think ahead taking into
[2491.62 - 2496.84] account the fundamental truth that you
[2493.90 - 2500.94] get to have an appetite
[2496.84 - 2500.94] hunger is a sign of life
[2502.60 - 2507.60] I love when Tick Tock shuts down my life
[2504.82 - 2507.60] and kicks me off
[2507.82 - 2512.38] you have nothing to prove by going all
[2510.40 - 2514.06] morning without breakfast or skipping
[2512.38 - 2517.62] lunch now here's something interesting
[2514.06 - 2517.62] and something important to know right
[2518.98 - 2524.56] mm info isn't about
[2521.80 - 2526.36] intermittent fasting and not eating
[2524.56 - 2528.64] anything all day long
[2526.36 - 2530.68] until the very end of the night
[2528.64 - 2532.96] it's not about that
[2530.68 - 2536.86] that's the way you kill your adrenals
[2532.96 - 2541.00] you destroy your adrenals
[2536.86 - 2543.88] mm info the cleanses any or
[2541.00 - 2546.34] the information in here is adrenal
[2543.88 - 2548.44] protective it's all about protecting the
[2546.34 - 2550.78] adrenals so these cleanses and these
[2548.44 - 2552.88] books are Geared for protecting The
[2550.78 - 2554.26] Originals you'll see misinformation out
[2552.88 - 2556.72] there and you'll see somebody say oh
[2554.26 - 2558.28] wait it's too tough on adrenals what are
[2556.72 - 2560.40] you talking about it's actually for your
[2558.28 - 2563.26] adrenals it's to protect them because
[2560.40 - 2565.00] adrenals are destroyed with all these
[2563.26 - 2567.58] other different diets and different
[2565.00 - 2569.26] things and belief systems out there they
[2567.58 - 2571.24] just get annihilated with so many people
[2569.26 - 2573.94] they do good for a little while and then
[2571.24 - 2576.42] boom they're hurting bad later they
[2573.94 - 2576.42] don't know why
[2582.34 - 2588.34] all it does is set you up to run on
[2584.44 - 2590.92] adrenaline and get tired irritable
[2588.34 - 2593.64] I'm gonna get these cookies out
[2590.92 - 2593.64] take a look
[2601.36 - 2605.32] I like my cookies with a little bit of
[2603.70 - 2607.42] crispiness to it
[2605.32 - 2609.70] I don't like them chewy and soft I like
[2607.42 - 2612.06] them a little bit crisp crispy a little
[2609.70 - 2612.06] brown
[2613.00 - 2616.84] what happens is a lot of people don't
[2614.62 - 2619.48] realize it but they run on adrenaline
[2616.84 - 2622.42] and get tired and irritable and they get
[2619.48 - 2624.58] over hungry and then they do
[2622.42 - 2626.74] grab things they probably wouldn't have
[2624.58 - 2629.52] grabbed because they starved themselves
[2626.74 - 2629.52] the whole day
[2632.98 - 2639.94] tree spennett says I'm in day three of
[2635.38 - 2642.28] 369 wish me luck haha amazing
[2639.94 - 2645.52] so happy to hear that
[2642.28 - 2646.96] healing with Holly 144 hunger is a sign
[2645.52 - 2648.16] of life
[2646.96 - 2650.50] quote
[2648.16 - 2653.76] I think about this mm quote so often
[2650.50 - 2653.76] it's so comforting
[2657.82 - 2662.20] whenever you can plan ahead prep your
[2660.16 - 2663.94] snacks and meals ahead of time on days
[2662.20 - 2666.10] you'll be away from home or when you
[2663.94 - 2668.14] know you'll get too busy to stop and
[2666.10 - 2670.24] spend time in the kitchen midday think
[2668.14 - 2673.00] about ordering cases of produce if you
[2670.24 - 2675.94] need to so you have it like a you know a
[2673.00 - 2677.14] backlog of it it's that it's it's what
[2675.94 - 2678.88] you need
[2677.14 - 2680.02] to have enough ingredients on hand
[2678.88 - 2681.64] another thing too is a lot of people
[2680.02 - 2683.50] don't have the ingredients they don't
[2681.64 - 2686.20] have bananas on hand
[2683.50 - 2688.60] they didn't grab a few extra bunches
[2686.20 - 2690.82] they don't have potatoes on hand they
[2688.60 - 2692.92] didn't grab an extra bag a five pound
[2690.82 - 2694.90] bag of potatoes so they really don't
[2692.92 - 2696.46] have much in stock
[2694.90 - 2697.78] and they're grabbing little pieces here
[2696.46 - 2699.40] and there and then end up going and
[2697.78 - 2701.74] ordering something or they end up going
[2699.40 - 2703.30] out and getting food out and in that
[2701.74 - 2705.94] food out it's like
[2703.30 - 2708.88] the fake olive oil mixed with canola oil
[2705.94 - 2711.76] and all the MSG and in the food out and
[2708.88 - 2713.68] everything even foods that are in like
[2711.76 - 2716.26] seemingly healthy restaurants really
[2713.68 - 2718.06] healthy restaurants loaded with MSG the
[2716.26 - 2722.28] soy sauces that are all hidden in there
[2718.06 - 2722.28] everything just lots of MSG
[2726.82 - 2732.66] cookie time
[2729.34 - 2732.66] put my Stones right here
[2739.12 - 2744.06] yeah
[2741.34 - 2744.06] boom
[2744.16 - 2749.14] can I actually show you guys
[2746.44 - 2752.02] there's a raisin that's running around I
[2749.14 - 2755.02] saw a raisin running around
[2752.02 - 2757.00] just that was crazy watch this video
[2755.02 - 2759.78] afterwards find out how that reason was
[2757.00 - 2759.78] cruising like that
[2761.32 - 2763.86] all right
[2775.30 - 2779.64] okay let me get these on a plate
[2780.22 - 2783.76] but I'm gonna let them cool a little bit
[2781.90 - 2786.96] did you ever burn your tongue because
[2783.76 - 2786.96] you don't want to wait
[2787.06 - 2791.82] this is a very hot cookie right here
[2789.10 - 2791.82] right out of the oven
[2794.74 - 2799.00] but I know I'm gonna burn my tongue or
[2797.38 - 2801.58] burn my mouth
[2799.00 - 2804.24] Gotta Wait I gotta have patience gotta
[2801.58 - 2804.24] have some patience
[2804.52 - 2807.82] boots McGee over there on YouTube
[2805.90 - 2810.22] definitely as long as I'm eating every
[2807.82 - 2813.16] 90 minutes I make way better decisions
[2810.22 - 2815.38] you also protect your adrenals
[2813.16 - 2818.98] but since the light blasts I no longer
[2815.38 - 2822.10] beat myself up when it isn't feasible
[2818.98 - 2823.98] do not beat yourself up
[2822.10 - 2826.36] and I'm so glad you don't anymore
[2823.98 - 2827.80] mystere said pretty cookies over there
[2826.36 - 2829.18] on YouTube
[2827.80 - 2830.32] so we're talking about all kinds of
[2829.18 - 2832.12] stuff I just want to give you guys a
[2830.32 - 2833.92] reminder we are day five with collecting
[2832.12 - 2835.66] Stones medication journey and it's a
[2833.92 - 2838.18] profound Journey now
[2835.66 - 2840.16] kind of downplay in it
[2838.18 - 2842.38] I'm downplaying it because I'm getting a
[2840.16 - 2844.96] little emotional about
[2842.38 - 2846.88] day seven when we have to let our Stones
[2844.96 - 2848.38] go
[2846.88 - 2851.26] it's unbelievable what's happening it's
[2848.38 - 2853.66] a phenomenon or or a hundred thousand
[2851.26 - 2855.58] people doing this collecting Stones
[2853.66 - 2859.36] meditation Journey with us all together
[2855.58 - 2861.94] there are a hundred thousand people
[2859.36 - 2865.00] doing this collecting Stones meditation
[2861.94 - 2867.28] Journey as of right now
[2865.00 - 2869.44] a hundred thousand people
[2867.28 - 2872.38] so keep that in mind this is like a
[2869.44 - 2875.02] collective this is a Powerhouse of
[2872.38 - 2876.52] healing happening for all of us people
[2875.02 - 2878.80] are feeling so comfortable with their
[2876.52 - 2880.66] Stones they're able to talk to them and
[2878.80 - 2884.26] not feel judged
[2880.66 - 2886.06] that is incredible and mind-blowing and
[2884.26 - 2887.68] very healing they don't feel like
[2886.06 - 2889.42] they're being judged when they're
[2887.68 - 2893.28] talking to their stones
[2889.42 - 2893.28] they don't feel that way at all
[2893.56 - 2897.22] there's Martinez says over there on
[2895.42 - 2899.32] YouTube the light blast was my first one
[2897.22 - 2901.36] I'm so grateful we had the opportunity
[2899.32 - 2903.22] to do it it helped me I'm planning on
[2901.36 - 2905.02] another one I don't know when but it's
[2903.22 - 2908.88] going to be it's gonna be this year and
[2905.02 - 2908.88] it's going to be sometime soon
[2911.02 - 2914.86] I think that I'm trying to keep it kind
[2913.72 - 2917.64] of low-key
[2914.86 - 2919.96] but I'm beaming absolutely beaming
[2917.64 - 2921.82] because I know the kind of healing
[2919.96 - 2924.58] that's taking place
[2921.82 - 2927.52] in every individual
[2924.58 - 2928.80] and I'm
[2927.52 - 2931.60] it's it's
[2928.80 - 2934.48] extremely exciting
[2931.60 - 2936.22] but I kind of got a little nervousness
[2934.48 - 2939.10] right because the nervousness is
[2936.22 - 2942.04] involved with I know
[2939.10 - 2943.72] the time has to come to release and let
[2942.04 - 2947.26] the stones go
[2943.72 - 2948.76] I know it's coming soon
[2947.26 - 2950.98] that's gonna be hard to let go of my
[2948.76 - 2952.72] Stones I've actually really have grown
[2950.98 - 2954.34] close to my Stones my stones have been
[2952.72 - 2956.32] absorbing so much
[2954.34 - 2959.14] of the things that have been inside me
[2956.32 - 2962.08] that that I've experienced
[2959.14 - 2964.42] being an underdog being um being bullied
[2962.08 - 2967.60] my whole life all of it for hearing a
[2964.42 - 2969.58] voice being taken advantage of being
[2967.60 - 2971.80] taken taken for granted
[2969.58 - 2972.52] people poaching all my info not citing
[2971.80 - 2974.86] me
[2972.52 - 2977.38] not having any respect for the fact that
[2974.86 - 2980.50] there's so much contributed
[2977.38 - 2982.90] from me in spirit to the health movement
[2980.50 - 2984.94] in these last 35 years and how it would
[2982.90 - 2988.90] not be like it is today
[2984.94 - 2992.86] it would be literally a Barren desert
[2988.90 - 2995.98] and all of that I can live with
[2992.86 - 2998.68] but it's nice to get some of
[2995.98 - 3001.08] this hurt that's been in there and get
[2998.68 - 3004.44] that out into the stones and more than
[3001.08 - 3007.88] 35 years of the work I've done
[3004.44 - 3007.88] to get information out there
[3007.92 - 3012.30] healing From the Inside Out says hubby
[3009.90 - 3014.58] and I have had these awful tense
[3012.30 - 3017.16] conversations about a certain subject
[3014.58 - 3021.30] day three we've literally broke into
[3017.16 - 3024.18] Common Ground whoa it was no longer
[3021.30 - 3027.20] emotional the Stones played a huge part
[3024.18 - 3027.20] in that thank you
[3027.48 - 3032.58] stones
[3028.92 - 3035.04] we're kind of creating that channel
[3032.58 - 3038.00] creating
[3035.04 - 3038.00] that frequency
[3038.10 - 3042.66] pulling in some of that old pain and
[3040.80 - 3046.38] sorrow
[3042.66 - 3049.40] kind of clearing the room all of it
[3046.38 - 3049.40] that's what they can do

[3731.64 - 3738.06] why do all heart specialists and other
[3734.34 - 3740.58] doctors promoting a low carb diet
[3738.06 - 3744.48] personally I'm sick of hearing about how
[3740.58 - 3747.24] bad carbs are I'm grabbing an apple now
[3744.48 - 3749.82] dear Lord
[3747.24 - 3752.06] apples are incredible for the heart the
[3749.82 - 3752.06] liver
[3752.34 - 3757.56] apples are so good for the liver
[3755.22 - 3760.22] and when the liver gets healthier it
[3757.56 - 3760.22] helps the heart
[3762.30 - 3766.50] and they say I'm the food police for
[3765.18 - 3768.66] you you're not even allowed to eat an
[3766.50 - 3770.10] apple
[3768.66 - 3774.18] Susan says
[3770.10 - 3777.12] I'm sorry upset I had to stop my stones
[3774.18 - 3779.66] medication
[3777.12 - 3779.66] wait a minute
[3781.14 - 3786.66] Susan Fontes on IG
[3784.14 - 3788.58] I'm sorry upset
[3786.66 - 3790.32] I had to stop my Stones medication
[3788.58 - 3791.58] because I had an extremely difficult and
[3790.32 - 3794.40] stressful day
[3791.58 - 3795.96] oh meditation but it turned out to a
[3794.40 - 3797.70] typo to medication I was going to say
[3795.96 - 3799.02] did you really have your stones on
[3797.70 - 3803.64] medication
[3799.02 - 3803.64] I thought the stones were on medication
[3804.24 - 3806.88] I had an extremely difficult and
[3805.68 - 3809.04] stressful day I'm really sorry to hear
[3806.88 - 3811.80] that then I couldn't find my stones for
[3809.04 - 3815.10] two days oh my God
[3811.80 - 3816.78] but I couldn't reach at all
[3815.10 - 3819.44] that's your heart
[3816.78 - 3819.44] all right
[3819.78 - 3823.56] I think hopefully I wasn't rude
[3822.72 - 3826.32] um
[3823.56 - 3828.36] listen we we get
[3826.32 - 3830.64] I understand you know when we get
[3828.36 - 3832.68] stressful days
[3830.64 - 3833.82] and we can't even do we can't even do
[3832.68 - 3835.98] what we need to do but that's okay
[3833.82 - 3837.78] because your intention is there you have
[3835.98 - 3839.46] it in the back your mind
[3837.78 - 3841.44] so if you had a really stressful day and
[3839.46 - 3843.60] you didn't you weren't able to do the
[3841.44 - 3845.84] stone meditation for two days that's
[3843.60 - 3845.84] okay
[3846.00 - 3851.64] your Stones know this they know this so
[3849.72 - 3854.22] keep on going if you can all the way to
[3851.64 - 3855.90] the end you got still today tonight you
[3854.22 - 3857.82] still got tomorrow you still got the
[3855.90 - 3861.68] seventh day okay
[3857.82 - 3861.68] all right I love you guys
