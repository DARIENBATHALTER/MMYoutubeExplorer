00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
How many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health? Chances are, whether

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,559
they show it or not, most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,240
in your life do. And chances are, you're

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
one of them.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,320
Whether you're dealing with anxiety,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,000
depression, endometriosis, acne, eczema,

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,400
autoimmune, thyroid, lime, brain fog,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,320
fatigue, or any other symptom or

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,120
condition, you're far from alone.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,040
Living with symptoms has become the new

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
normal. So, no more guessing games. It's

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,320
time to get answers. Welcome to the

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
Medical Medium Podcast. I'm Anthony

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,399
William.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,879
We're talking about angels. That's

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,360
right, angels.

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,360
Do you believe in angels? There are a

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,879
lot of people that do and then there's

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,520
some that don't. And did you know you're

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,760
not alone? Now, it's easy to think

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
you're alone when you don't feel good.

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,560
You're on mattress island or you got

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
some aches and pains and you're sick

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
going through a lot of different

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,119
struggles. Or maybe you went through

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,759
some betrayal, some hardships, some

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,400
letdowns. It could make somebody think

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,720
like, "What's the point?" But the thing

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,759
is, there's angels, angelic forces, and

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,520
they're around. They're looking out. And

32
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
there's a lot of crazy stuff happening

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
in the world right now. Seems to be

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
getting worse and worse and worse with

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,240
the quickening, but it just puts the

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,960
angels on guard. The angels become hyper

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,560
aware. This means hyper aare for you.

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,720
This means looking out for you. We just

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
have to learn how to call them. We just

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,079
have to keep our eyes open. We just got

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,000
to think about them because they're

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,640
there and they care. Now remember, we

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
have an audience. God and the angels are

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
looking out. Now, in this episode, we're

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,640
going to cover some different angels.

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,440
Angels you can call upon. Angels that

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,239
are hoping you call upon them. Now get

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,720
ready. Fasten your seat belts. It's time

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,640
to connect to some angels. It's time to

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,959
be connected, tuned in. And with angels,

51
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,959
you're in the right place at the right

52
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,959
time.

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,400
I've seen signs in my lifetime. I've

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,280
seen angels. I know they're real. And

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,000
not just real, real. I've seen one when

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,120
I was almost drowning underwater saving

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,080
my dog many, many years ago. And that

58
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,720
angel saved my life. And throughout the

59
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,000
decades, I've seen others. And I've also

60
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,680
seen the signs. And you have, too.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
You've seen the signs. I know you have.

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,280
Think about it a little bit. What about

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,080
that time you could not explain and it

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,760
just didn't make sense how it all

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,560
happened? That day, that moment. You

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,440
knew something was up. And maybe you're

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,400
somebody where you didn't know. You just

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,760
don't remember. But it happened.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,360
Something happened. There was a sign.

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,400
There was an angel. Something occurred.

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,080
Because what happens with human beings

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,319
is we block things out. Yes, we block

73
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,519
things out. We don't see it in the

74
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,480
moment. It's not crystal clear.

75
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,239
Something supernatural happens and we

76
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,440
don't really see it. We experience it.

77
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,040
It gets locked up in our

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,319
subconsciousness.

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,680
Our subconscious holds on to it. Our

80
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,040
soul holds on to it. But we kind of pack

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,680
it up, lock it up, and move on as if

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,720
nothing ever happened. But it did

83
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,480
happen. It did. And a lot of people out

84
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,040
there, they think back and they're like,

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,000
"Wait a minute. That would have never

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,640
happened unless this happened. That

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,200
would have never occurred unless this

88
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,239
occurred. I would have never got through

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,519
that if something supernatural didn't

90
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,680
occur. I would have never made it if God

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,160
wasn't involved. If God didn't

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
intervene, I would have never survived

93
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,520
that. If it wasn't for some kind of

94
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,000
angelic force. And I remember I remember

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,800
seeing something. It was there. There

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,360
was something holy present. There was

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,800
some kind of angelic force present.

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,880
There was some kind of godly force there

99
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,280
and present. And what about the people

100
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,919
that had a difficult experience in life,

101
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,960
a struggle, something happened and they

102
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,960
just barely made it out alive and they

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
know deep down in their heart it could

104
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,280
have been so much worse that something

105
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,520
intervened. Yeah, they got hit hard.

106
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,759
Yeah, they got scarred with something.

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,960
But in the end, they know something

108
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,840
interveneed. They made it. They survived

109
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,560
it. As bad as it was, they still

110
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,520
survived it. Every little thing we do

111
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,479
here has an impact. There's an impact

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,880
spiritually. I recently heard a story

113
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,440
about a guy that loved to save animals

114
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
of all kinds. That's my kind of guy

115
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,199
because I like to do that too. He used

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,160
to save bunny rabbits, cats, dogs,

117
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,720
foxes, turtles, coyotes, whatever came

118
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,560
his way. And one day he saw something in

119
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
the road as he was driving his car and

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,440
it was a snake. He parked his car. He

121
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,600
jumped right out. And he grabbed the

122
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,240
snake without thinking about anything.

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,880
And then the snake bit him. Bit him

124
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,840
good. And the snake wasn't a friendly

125
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,720
snake. It was a timber rattlesnake. And

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,479
the venom started traveling. Traveling

127
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,360
to kill this man. He went numb. Couldn't

128
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,240
talk. Couldn't walk. First responders

129
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,639
got to him. They got him to the

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,919
hospital. He got treatment. He got the

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,880
antivenenom and he nearly died. He was

132
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,720
on death's door. When he finally started

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
coming around and they pulled him out of

134
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,479
the medicine induced coma, he knew he

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,759
knew supernatural means, supernatural

136
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,759
powers were there that day. supernatural

137
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,120
powers that either came with the first

138
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,960
responders or were there in his car or

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,759
were there above looking down at him as

140
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,960
he got bitten by that snake. And he was

141
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,360
all heart wanted to rescue little

142
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
creatures. Little creatures that other

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,880
people wouldn't care about. Little

144
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
creatures that other people would just

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,080
run right over in the streets. Who

146
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,440
cares? But the angels above knew he had

147
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,960
a big heart and had their eyes on him.

148
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,080
And he knew he was saved. And they knew

149
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,120
he cared. He cared about life. He cared

150
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,720
about little animals and their lives.

151
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
And is he ever going to jump out and

152
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,880
grab a snake without thinking for a

153
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,560
moment? No. He's never going to do that

154
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,280
again. But still, he was seen from above

155
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,000
and he was spared. He still had

156
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,520
important work to do on planet Earth.

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,840
He still had important purpose. He still

158
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,160
had a lot of work to do for God. And

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,960
what if he wasn't spared? What if he

160
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,919
died that day right on that road after

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,360
being bitten by a snake? Then God had

162
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,680
bigger plans. God and the angels had

163
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,680
another plan for them. And that's what

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
happens to a lot of people that leave

165
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
early. They were watched. They were

166
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
seen.

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,960
But they needed to go somewhere. They

168
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
needed to cross over. They needed to get

169
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,400
to the other side because they needed to

170
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,120
come back because there was a bigger

171
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,680
plan and God needed them to start all

172
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,000
over again. You see, we're never truly

173
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,039
alone down here. Now, when it comes down

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,319
to angels, angels tend to walk through

175
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,800
woods. They tend to stand on highways.

176
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,440
They like to stand on bridges. They like

177
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,800
to stand on top of buildings. And

178
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,440
they're experts at chaos. Not chaos

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
because they create chaos. They do the

180
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,599
opposite. They're experts at knowing

181
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,399
about chaos, seeing it, understanding

182
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,360
it, knowing how it's caused. All the way

183
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,360
from wars to little things that happen

184
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,200
in people's lives that don't feel so

185
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,919
little. Angels are no stranger to chaos.

186
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,440
And angels know people like to do stupid

187
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,000
things. They like to drive drunk, drive

188
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,480
under the influence. They like to peer

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,760
pressure people, pushing them over the

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,560
edge. They like to bully people till the

191
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,680
people give up and lose hope. And

192
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
angels, they watch it all. They see it

193
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,279
all. And angels are looking for people

194
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,640
to tune into them. They're looking for

195
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,040
people who think about them. Angels want

196
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,240
people to be connected. They want people

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,880
to care about angels. And there's a

198
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,800
reason for that. Angels want people to

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,600
have faith because angels, holy angels,

200
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,399
love God. And angels know people

201
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,440
struggle with God. And that's okay.

202
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,279
Angels protect God and care about God.

203
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,880
And if somebody doesn't care about God,

204
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:42,399
that's okay. Angels like to turn people

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:45,519
around. Angels like to show signs. Signs

206
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,320
that make people doubt everything they

207
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,440
thought before. Signs that are

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,480
miraculous. Signs of things that people

209
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,839
can't explain. Angels want to turn

210
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,360
doubting Thomases around. They want them

211
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,959
to get that aha moment. They want that

212
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:09,600
wait a minute here. Something is going

213
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,160
on that's beyond anybody's imagination.

214
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,800
Because then a spark of light, a spark

215
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,680
of faith begins. So why are we talking

216
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,279
about all this? Because it's about

217
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
getting a deeper connection to the

218
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,560
angels. It's about learning to call upon

219
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,760
the angels. It's about knowing you're

220
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,079
not alone and you are seen from above

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
and that you can call upon the angels

222
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,160
and you can talk to the angels. You can

223
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,000
ask for help from the angels. And the

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,800
one way to do this is to know that

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,079
you're worthy. Yes, you're worthy. And

226
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,640
it doesn't have to be a big ego thing.

227
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,920
It's a humble thing. It's a humble

228
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,000
understanding that you are worth it and

229
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,000
that you are worthy. And when you're

230
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,240
sick or been sick, the angels know you

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,160
got something they love. They don't want

232
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,480
you sick. They don't want you to have

233
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
chronic illness. That's not what they

234
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,920
love. But you got something else they

235
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,040
love. It's that unbelievable powerful

236
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,519
spiritual growth that you have inside

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,640
that you have within. And that life

238
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,480
experience of being sick, stricken with

239
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,160
an illness, having a symptom or a

240
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,480
condition is worth everything to angels

241
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
is worth everything to the angelic realm

242
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,000
because all that spiritual growth is

243
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
collected inside your soul. Your soul is

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,760
on another level and it means you have

245
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,800
spiritual power. That spiritual growth

246
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,000
equals spiritual power and it can't be

247
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,560
taken from you ever. Mental hardships,

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
emotional hardships and physical

249
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,839
hardships are worth their weight in

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,079
spiritual light, spiritual wisdom,

251
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:56,000
spiritual power, spiritual light from

252
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,399
above, God's light, the angel's light.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
But you have to see it. You have to know

254
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
this. You have to be able to get in

255
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,000
touch with this. And you have to look

256
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,000
out for the signs. They're there. You

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,639
just have to see them. You have to be

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,639
open-minded. You have to be open to it.

259
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,800
You have to look for them. And it's okay

260
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
if you're not. The signs will still be

261
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
there. You might see one. You might

262
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,560
catch one. They're still there. But what

263
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,320
if we make that connection stronger?

264
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,360
What if we learn to call upon the

265
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,839
angels? You see, you have every

266
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,720
God-given right to reach out to the

267
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
angels. You were born with this right to

268
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,959
reach out to angels. So, let's talk

269
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,200
about the 27 essential angels. To begin

270
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,200
with, these aren't the only angels.

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,079
These are just some of the angels that

272
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,560
are around us, that are above us that

273
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,200
work for God. Let's start with the angel

274
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,399
of faith. And although the angel of

275
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,120
faith is there to help you build faith,

276
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,200
to help instill faith in you, you can

277
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
call upon the angel of faith for other

278
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,160
things, too. She's there to help you

279
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,880
build conviction. She wants you to have

280
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,959
faith. If you're lacking faith, she

281
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,760
wants you to have strong faith. She's

282
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,760
one of the easiest angels to call upon,

283
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,160
especially if you're sick, especially if

284
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,399
you have a symptom, especially if you're

285
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,600
ailing, if you're hurting, if you're in

286
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,480
pain. The angel of faith wants you to

287
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,519
hold that faith strong while you're

288
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,639
healing. And then she wants you to have

289
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,360
a faith that you're going to heal, a

290
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,639
faith in healing. And you can say,

291
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,200
"Angel of faith, I need your help. I

292
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,959
need to build my faith. I need it

293
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,399
stronger. Can you please come and help?"

294
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,760
Another angel that's really powerful and

295
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,959
easy to call upon is the angel of trust.

296
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,279
And if you're somebody and you're

297
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,519
hurting and you don't feel good and

298
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,399
you've been sick a long time and you

299
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,760
lost trust in your body, trust in the

300
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,279
system, trust in the medical system,

301
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,160
trust in people, trust in anything, then

302
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,760
it's time to call the angel of trust to

303
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,680
help you when you're struggling, when

304
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,079
you're trying to recover. And one of the

305
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,880
hard parts about losing trust, one of

306
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,600
the hard parts about being sick is you

307
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
lose trust in your own decisions. And if

308
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,680
you're losing trust in your own

309
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,880
decisions, then it's time to call the

310
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,560
angel of trust. Angel of trust, I need

311
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,079
help. Can you please come down? Are you

312
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,480
there? I need your guidance. I need my

313
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:39,680
trust to get stronger. I'm trying to

314
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,600
heal and I need my trust stronger to do

315
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,240
so. Another angel that's really powerful

316
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,000
is the angel of mercy. One of the most

317
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,560
powerful angels out there. An angel that

318
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,839
can match the archangels and strength.

319
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,040
An angel with a lot of compassion. An

320
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,079
angel that works for God, the angelic

321
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,800
realm with all its glory. And the angel

322
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:08,000
of mercy is called upon, is summoned by

323
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,040
God many times to battle darkness, to

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,519
fights for humankind. The fight fights

325
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,120
for God. Do you think she's too out of

326
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,360
reach? No. The Angel of Mercy is not.

327
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,399
She's there for you. You just have to

328
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,519
ask. You just have to ask for the Angel

329
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,199
of Mercy's help. Angel of mercy, I need

330
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:32,800
your help. Will you please come down?

331
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,680
I'm having a fight, a battle in life. I

332
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,839
need help. I feel like my soul's being

333
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,519
challenged. I feel like my body is

334
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,560
losing steam. Can you help me? One angel

335
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,800
I truly love is the angel of healing.

336
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,079
The angel of healing helps with the

337
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,560
soul, helps with anxiety, helps with any

338
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,199
kind of struggle, helps with a sickness

339
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,440
and illness, especially for long term.

340
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,240
The angel of healing is a wonderful

341
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,800
angel to call upon when there's a sick

342
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,279
loved one, someone you're sitting by

343
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,199
their bedside, they're struggling,

344
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,440
they're going through a lot. You call

345
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,399
upon the angel of healing and things

346
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,680
start to calm down. You'll notice

347
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,680
something change as she enters the room.

348
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,040
And then there's the angel of

349
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,600
restitution. This angel understands the

350
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,959
soul, understands the spirit and how it

351
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,519
can be beaten down. This is an angel

352
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,199
that understands emotional trauma,

353
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,360
emotional abuse, emotional hardship. She

354
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,880
understands if somebody has done you

355
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,839
wrong. She understands if some worldly

356
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,639
power, some institution, or some

357
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,440
individual has harmed you. The angel of

358
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,680
restitution has your back. Just got to

359
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,839
call upon her. And then there's the

360
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,920
angel of purity. There are so many

361
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,680
people out there with addictions. It's

362
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,079
how this world works. You can get

363
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,720
addicted to anything. Darkness in this

364
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,920
world wants us to have temptation. Wants

365
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,400
us to have addictions. Wants us to be

366
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,959
slaves to addictions. And if you're

367
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,520
struggling, struggling with anything,

368
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,480
any kind of addiction, you call upon the

369
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,520
angel of purity. Angel of purity, I feel

370
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,400
stuck. I feel trapped. I can't break

371
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,559
this addiction. I can't stop my coffee

372
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,600
drinking. I can't stop my cigarette

373
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,679
smoking. I can't stop my arguing. I

374
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,080
can't stop the recreational drugs. I

375
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,320
can't stop from running away. And I

376
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,039
can't stop my worrying. I need your

377
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,160
help. You have to come. You have to help

378
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,720
me, please. And then there's the angel

379
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,039
of peace. I love the angel of peace and

380
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,240
I've used the angel of peace many times

381
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,160
in my life. I've asked for help along

382
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,960
the way. You can ask for the angel of

383
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,919
peace to quiet your mind to help you

384
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,160
think about positive things, to calm

385
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,840
your brain, calm your mind, calm your

386
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
neurotransmitters,

387
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,160
calm down your electrical impulses,

388
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,960
relax your neurons, soothe your soul, or

389
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,799
just ask the angel of peace to sit by

390
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,720
your bedside, to sit there at night. Ask

391
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,440
the angel of peace to sit there all

392
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,919
night long. Especially if you're sick,

393
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,160
if you're unwell, you don't feel good,

394
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
and you have a lot of worry, ask the

395
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,799
angel of peace to come by. Tell the

396
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,480
angel of peace that you're unwell, and

397
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,039
you would love her support. And then

398
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,559
there's the angel of dreams. You can ask

399
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,600
the angel of dreams to enter your dream.

400
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,720
Enter your dream state, to be in your

401
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,120
dream, looking out for you. guarding

402
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
you, protecting you while you're

403
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,559
dreaming. Ask the angel of dreams to

404
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,200
help you decode your dreams, give you a

405
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,080
better understanding. And if you ask the

406
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,200
angel of dreams to come to your dreams

407
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,480
every single night to enter them,

408
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,480
something profound happens. Your dreams

409
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,360
become more clear, more vivid. They

410
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,360
become more understandable and you make

411
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,480
connections with your dreams and you see

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,520
signs in your dreams. And then there's

413
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,480
the angel of time to help you remember

414
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,960
things that you forgot. They're in

415
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,120
there. They're in your soul. They're in

416
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,919
the memory banks. They're in your

417
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,960
neurons, but they're not accessible.

418
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,520
You're asking the angel of time to time

419
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,280
travel for you. You're asking the angel

420
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,440
of time to look for those memories to

421
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,400
bring you back there, to actually bring

422
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,120
you to that place. So all of a sudden,

423
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,799
these memories start to arrive. Good

424
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,280
memories, beautiful memories. Memories

425
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,679
that have been lost. They're gone.

426
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,440
They've been forgotten. Ask the angel of

427
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,640
time to help you find resolve.

428
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,039
experiences that were forgotten that can

429
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,600
solve puzzles in your life that can

430
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:11,919
solve problems. Say to the angel of

431
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,559
time, "Angel of time, can you help me?

432
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,160
Can you come here? Can you sort things

433
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,400
out? Can you take me back in time? Can

434
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,000
you help me remember things,

435
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,360
experiences,

436
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,120
moments that were precious in my life? I

437
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,960
want to feel that feeling that I had. I

438
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,080
want to experience

439
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,520
what occurred back then. I want to use

440
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,240
it now in my difficult times. I want to

441
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,080
remember moments in my life that needed

442
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,559
resolve so I can resolve them now. Can

443
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,559
you help me? Never be afraid to call

444
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,720
upon the angels.

445
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:56,080
Never be scared to ask for help. Never

446
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,039
feel that you don't have the worth, that

447
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,480
you are not a good person, that you

448
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,840
don't deserve help from the angels.

449
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:10,559
Never feel you don't deserve help from

450
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:14,159
God. Never feel that you don't deserve

451
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,559
anything. You're a good person.

452
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,600
You should call the angels. You should

453
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,159
ask for help. You deserve good things.

454
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,320
And you're a spiritual person.

455
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,360
And you have a spiritual connection, a

456
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,720
connection up above, a connection to the

457
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,360
angels, a connection to God. Never

458
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,840
forget it. If you get a chance, check

466
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,360
Comes to a point in everyone's life

467
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,600
where they think no one understands and

468
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,919
they feel they're alone in what they're

469
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,480
struggling with. They're alone in what

470
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,039
they're facing. Even when there's people

471
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,840
around them, even when loved ones are

472
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,360
around them, they can feel lost. They

473
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,200
can feel sad. They can feel lonely. And

474
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,360
they can feel like no one's really

475
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,240
listening. And when it comes to chronic

476
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,480
illness, it becomes a personal battle.

477
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,559
Every day could feel like a struggle.

478
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,120
Even every hour can feel like a

479
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,760
struggle. And with so many aspects of

480
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,559
chronic illness, it is a struggle. A

481
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,440
struggle that others can't understand

482
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,200
unless they've been there before. And if

483
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,640
you're in that struggle and you feel

484
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,120
like you're alone, I got words for you.

485
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,480
You're not alone. The angels are

486
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,640
watching. the angels you can call upon.

487
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,280
There are people out there that feel a

488
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,360
loved one is watching them. They feel a

489
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,159
loved one is around them, that has

490
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,720
crossed over, that has left. And that's

491
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
true. Maybe there is a loved one that's

492
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,000
keeping an eye out. And that does

493
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,919
happen. But also what happens is that

494
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,240
angels are around. They are nearby. They

495
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,960
give out an energy. They give out a

496
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,559
warmth. You have to look for the signs.

497
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,520
And you might have seen the signs

498
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,600
before, but just don't realize it that

499
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,679
they were there. You might have walked

500
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,120
by the signs. You might have heard

501
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,159
something. You might have felt

502
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,919
something. Angels want you to believe in

503
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,039
them. Angels want to help, but they need

504
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,400
you to be involved as well. Angels want

505
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:42,080
your faith strong. And if it isn't,

506
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,320
that's okay. The angels love you anyway.

507
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,640
There comes a time when you look back

508
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,919
behind you and your struggles are far

509
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,320
away. Your pain, your suffering, your

510
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:55,120
illness, your sickness have been long

511
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,720
gone and you're standing strong. And

512
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,200
you'll remember that you weren't alone.

513
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,240
You'll see it clear. You'll remember a

514
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,240
time when you now know an angel was

515
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
near.

516

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,080
answers like so many have before them.

541
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,080
The medical medium information here on

542
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,919
this podcast doesn't come from broken

543
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,919
science, interest groups, medical

544
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,640
funding with strings attached, botched

545
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
research, lobbyists, internal kickbacks,

546
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,799
persuaded belief systems, private panels

547
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,559
of influencers, health field payoffs,

548
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,400
trendy traps, or gathered bits and

549
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,320
pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because

550
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,240
chronic illness is exploding like never

551
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
before in our modern-day history, it

552
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
takes a greater force than us down here.

553
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,679
It takes a helping hand from above.

554
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,279
Medical medium information has street

555
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,559
cred. It's an organic movement of

556
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,320
countless people around the world

557
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,080
healing. More healing stories of real

558
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
people not being paid to tell their

559
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,840
life-changing experiences, of rising out

560
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
of the ashes of sickness and entering

561
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,600
into the light of full recovery, getting

562
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
their lives back, and finally healing

563
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
when nothing else in the world of health

564
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,640
could move the needle and get them

565
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,039
better. The information on this podcast

566
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,880
is not man-made. It comes from above,

567
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,799
from a higher source. Whatever you

568
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,720
believe in, whether God, the universe,

569
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,000
the light, or the creator, or if you

570
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,360
believe in nothing at all, that we're

571
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,039
just floating through space together on

572
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,880
this rock, know that the information you

573
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,640
hear on this podcast is separate from

574
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
all the other noise out there. It comes

575
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,799
from a different place. A pure

576
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,840
untampered with advanced clean

577
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:22,159
uncorrupted original primary source. A

578
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,159
higher source, spirit of compassion.
