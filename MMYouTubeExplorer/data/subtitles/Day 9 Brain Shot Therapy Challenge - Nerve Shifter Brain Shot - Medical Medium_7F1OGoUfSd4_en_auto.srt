miracle miraculously stealing people

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,640

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,559
in the brain saver books incredible

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,879
right there

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,079
nerve shifter that's what we're doing I

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,640
want to read a couple things to you

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,559
about it

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,600
use the nerve shifter when you're

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,460
feeling shaky or anxious how many people

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,140
are feeling shaky or anxious and when

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,920
you use this nerve shifter when you're

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,439
feeling shaky and anxious boom

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,960
boom it's incredible

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,820
If you experience random spasms Twitches

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,400
ticks or shifting and moving pain

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,320
throughout your body I hear it all the

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,140
time I hear it from Doctor friends I

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,180
hear it all the time twitches and spasms

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,500
aw my patient has all these Twitches

36
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,240
they can't get rid of them we don't know

37
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,520
what's wrong we did MRIs we did

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,259
everything CAT scans we did all the

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,900
different ultrasounds we don't know why

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,520
they're twitching they're spasming while

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,320
they're doing all this moving pain

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,020
throughout their body what is going on

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,119
AW and I would tell them

44
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,960
cranial nerves all this stuff about it

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,060
and that's what we're talking about

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,740
today cranial nerves so if you're

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,840
experiencing those kinds of spasms or

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,479
Twitches or anything like that it's like

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,520
boom nerve shifter time Bring It On in

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,840
the thing is about the nerve shifter it

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,540
can work

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,540
in that moment I'll talk about how it

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,700
does instant relief and it can work also

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,080
along the way if you're doing the nerve

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,400
shifter and that's what you choose and

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,220
that's what you pick and you're doing it

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,480
every day the power of that brain shot

58
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,879
therapy

59
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,739
it's just incredible like it can build

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,140
upon itself that's what I wanted to tell

61
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,239
you guys earlier that it can build upon

62
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,860
itself and build upon itself and that's

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
a big deal right there because that's

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,700
healing that's actually moving forward

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
You're Building upon itself all of it so

66
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,700
here we go when struggling with any kind

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,520
of neurological onset or episode

68
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,940
now that's a big one right there a

69
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,920
neurological onset or episode

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,680
what does that mean

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,440
one migraine coming on

72
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,440
boom get the nerve shifter out

73
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,239
right twitches and spasms coming out of

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,580
like getting out of control boom get the

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,080
nerve shifter out tingles and numbness

76
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,120
that's happening get the nerve shifter

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,720
up so it what it is is like if you got

78
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,940
neurological symptoms and you feel an

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,660
episode coming on

80
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,580
of any kind of neurological problem

81
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,019
and you feel it coming on and you're

82
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,000
like oh no I'm going to be dealing with

83
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,159
this again this is why I went to five

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,840
doctors this is why I went to the

85
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,220
specialist in the neurologist and it's

86
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,440
coming on again then you get the nerve

87
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,540
shifter out how incredible is that

88
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,800
here's one right here to break a nervous

89
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,099
feeling

90
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,300
about the moment you're in like you're

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,920
going to be going somewhere you're

92
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,720
meeting a friend you're going to a

93
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,519
wedding you're going to a party

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,500
you have an appointment somewhere and

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,840
you're nervous you have a doctor's

96
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,700
appointment and you're nervous you have

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,500
any kind of appointment then you bring

98
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,060
in there the nerve shifter how cool is

99
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,780
that

100
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,360
to help calm restless legs syndrome

101
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,280
restless legs and that's what people are

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,080
going to notice how incredible the nerve

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
shifter is for restless legs and any

104
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,900
kind of other issues

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,180
some people are already saying I'm

106
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,980
sleeping better because of it

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,599
so Kimberly Ann asked the question what

108
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,400
is in the nerve shifter you are looking

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,879
at what's in the nerve shifter right

110
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,620
here but it's the specific combination

111
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,580
and the amount

112
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,320
that makes the incredible Miracle happen

113
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,320
so it's the cilantro the kale the

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,540
spinach The Parsley the asparagus by the

115
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,540
way asparagus can be called a spear

116
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,360
right

117
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,979
it can be called a shoot too that's

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,320
something

119
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:32,220
it can be called a stock so I'm just

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,900
letting you know but there's no

121
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,900
difference it's it's either or right

122
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,199
lettuce in the celery and the lime when

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,620
you put those together

124
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,759
and a certain amount in a certain order

125
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,840
and these ones that's when it happens

126
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,840
which is incredible

127
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,360
so to break a nervous feeling like I was

128
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,560
talking about how about this one to calm

129
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,300
your restless legs and then how about

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,040
this one before you go flying and taking

131
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,720
a trip a car trip if you're nervous

132
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,940
about a car trip nervous about a plane

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,080
trip but these are just some reasons to

134
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,759
use it

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,620
if you have anything neurologically

136
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,479
going on and you feel like you need that

137
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,880
boost

138
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,860
then you can bring in the nerve shifter

139
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,860

188
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,900
it

189
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,699
you know and I knew you guys were gonna

190
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,680
get this experience

191
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,180
because of what they are because Spirit

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,960
compassion was saying it's instant

193
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,240
relief of my incredible incredible this

194
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,180
is how it works

195
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,340
Erica says I find this shot works beyond

196
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,020
what it says it helps it does work

197
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,520
beyond what it says it helps and that

198
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,680
that's another thing too the nerve

199
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,139
shifter does really a broad spectrum of

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,199
neurological problems

201
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:40,500
and what I love about the nerve shifter

202
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:43,880
is it can give relief instantly to some

203
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,039
symptoms while offering

204
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,599
long-term relief happening with other

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
symptoms

206
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,940
so what I like about the nerve shifter

207
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,699
is if you drink it

208
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,440
it builds on itself and then not only

209
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,520
gives you relief for say one or two

210
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,979
symptoms or something that you're

211
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,380
dealing with but it gives you long-term

212
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,580
relief because it builds on itself so

213
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,660
all of a sudden you're doing the nerve

214
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,520
shifter for a couple weeks and you're

215
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,259
like what is happening and then

216
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,699
life-changing results are happening in

217
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,800
other areas

218
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,780
which is incredible all on its own but

219
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,759
the shifter shots can do that you get 30

220
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,960
though you got the stabilizers to shift

221
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,520
your shots right and you got the

222
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,440
exposure shots you guys know now you

223
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,360
have the books

224
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,460
and how incredible that is medical

225
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,280
medium brain shot therapy offers instant

226
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,680
relief because it goes into the blood

227
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,300
vessels of the mouth absorbs instantly

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,779
and heads to the brain as fast as

229
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,779
possible

230
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,459
so it heads to the brain quick but it

231
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,320
isn't just that factor alone it's the

232
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,240
combination that nobody knew science or

233
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,399
research didn't know or anybody else in

234
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,440
health in the world and ever will

235
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,279
that the information that came from

236
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,779
above is cilantro spinach kale parsley

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,560
asparagus

238
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,120
lettuce celery and lime put together

239
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,000
just right in the combination of the

240
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,800
order makes it so that a certain group

241
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,980
of neurons

242
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,800
get the medicinal effect what the brain

243
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,100
shot therapies do is pinpoint groups of

244
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,260
neurons for specific reasons and healing

245
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,760
that right there can't be done anywhere

246
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,800
else that's how incredible this healing

247
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,839
tool is

248
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,720
Deborah said my brain is feeling so much

249
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,740
clearer from taking these shots

250
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,339
and that is so important because if that

251
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,600
can happen for us what does that mean it

252
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,600
means everything less doctor

253
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,720
appointments less stress less everything

254
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,360
that gives us a hard time Jenny Jen I

255
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,420
took the trauma shock and lost shot last

256
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,279
night and it helped my back pain I

257
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,240
wasn't expecting that that's how it

258
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,740
works it works like that because they're

259
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,600
that powerful and when you're dealing

260
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,180
with potent medicine entering the brain

261
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,420
really quick in certain regions

262
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,160
other things can start to improve

263
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,779
what happens is with that potent

264
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,700
medicine that's going there and it's

265
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,580
delivering their fast and that's

266
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,820
something too to think about

267
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,640
because the combination makes the

268
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,700
absorbent power quick

269
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,040
when you have a quick reaction occur

270
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,200
where it's driving to the brain and the

271
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,740
brain stem fast

272
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,019
you can get

273
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,760
reset and rewired fast

274
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,980
so what the brain shot therapies are

275
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,860
doing is they're a therapy that's

276
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,260

00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,320

extraordinary really it's incredible the

Spirit of compassion I talked about that

285
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,820
in the last eight days before today

286
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,160
these brain shots are composed of

287
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,320
specific combinations of ingredients

288
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,240
working together systematically for

289
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,079
specific reasons that only a source

290
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,079
above could know

291
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,320
incredible

292
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,779
the relationships among these

293
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,300
ingredients are intricate and unknown to

294
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,779
anyone until now this knowledge from

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,180
above has remained untapped but now it's

296
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,100
out in the world

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:19,500
there's a craving shifter I mean

375
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,480
yeah these can do so many things now

376
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,480
remember 50 ounces of water a minimum

377
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,160
through the day so it doesn't have to be

378
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,279
right when you take your shot so if just

379
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,620
pretend I just need the nerve shifter

380
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,600
now and I'm going to send it down

381
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,700
right

382
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,860
bartender give me another one right and

383
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,600
I just sent it down I'm not going to do

384
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,040
50 ounces of water right now I'm not

385
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,240
going to dilute it I'm not going to eat

386
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,560
a whole bunch of food I'm not going to

387
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
go out get a double cheeseburger I don't

388
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,519
eat double cheeseburgers I'm not going

389
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,860
to go out and eat that right when I sent

390
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,959
that down

391
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,399
you can also make them all at once store

392
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,260
them in a jar with the lid if you really

393
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,019
want

394
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,120
that's okay best to make them fresh that

395
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,500
best to make them on the spot best to

396
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,139
make them right now when you make them

397
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,820
each time but you can also do that too

398
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,459
make them ahead of time if you have to

399
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,399
and do other things

400
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:14,519
what the brain shot therapy does is it

401
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,560
gets to the brain stem the neurons in

402
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,899
various areas of the brain the emotional

403
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,440
center of the brain too gets there quick

404
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,600
and starts to Target and pinpoint areas

405
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,180
that need help it's almost like they

406
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,600
find their way

407
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,060
they're driven by light

408
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,100
comes from above so it just goes to the

409
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,199
brain and areas it's a miracle it's why

410
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,180
we're having Miracle results

411
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,880
how incredible

412
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,940
Debbie says did aw say when the mm-1500

413
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,139
will be restocked it is in stock so I

414
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,699
don't know why they're doing that did

415
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,880
you call the company because it's so

416
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:53,100
strange the mm-1500

417
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,220
should be in stock

418
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,139
and it's 20 off

419
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,220
incredible so what you'll see out there

420
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,240
you guys and I'll give you a rundown

421
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,380
we're going to talk about the vagus

422
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,579
nerves and everything else in a second

423
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,540
but I'll give you a quick rundown on

424
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,000
this

425
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,920
why is the mm1500 Great

426
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,079
it's great because it saves you money

427
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,420
what I'm noticing is everybody's all

428
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,760
pumped up about the MLM and affiliate

429
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,620
marketing juicers that are out there now

430
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,360
that have all this money behind them and

431
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,620
all that and they've the sharks have

432
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,540
gotten into the medical meme community

433
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,820
and everybody's buying these other

434
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,260
juicers fine buy them it's great but

435
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,800
you're going to spend

436
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,959
double the money on produce long term

437
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,040
so you lose money as you're using the

438
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,399
juicer

439
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,380
the difference is with the mm-1500 is

440
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,899
the high compression

441
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,600
and what's happening it's a masticating

442
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,220
slow masticating juicer so the nutrients

443
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,500
get preserved

444
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,540
now what people don't realize when you

445
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,279
use the the other juicers that are like

446
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,899
breaking into the community fine and

447
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,600
dandy right

448
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,579
what no one realizes it's not a slow

449
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,040
masticating juicer

450
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:00,480
it's not a slow cold pressed juicer

451
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,560
so what you're doing is you're losing

452
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,240
nutrients

453
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,059
the other problem

454
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,860
is you're not squeezing enough juice out

455
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,439
of the pulp

456
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,360
and so what you're doing is you have to

457
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,339
buy more so that means if you want a

458
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,020
juice with your juicer it's all great

459
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,520
and all but you'll have to buy more kale

460
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,559
more parsley more everything and the

461
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,140
cost of food is going up the reason why

462
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,380
I backed Omega and I work with them

463
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,439
is because the concept

464
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,900
of food going up in price like it is

465
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,580
in the concept of being able to save

466
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,039
people money why they use their medicine

467
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,160
machine

468
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,200
was a big deal to me because the

469
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
chronically ill they're not made of

470
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,740
money

471
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,960
and so saving money wherever they can is

472
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,700
critical so be careful if you unless

473
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,280
you're rich if you're totally rich and

474
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,980
you want to just throw produce down the

475
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,720
Chute of your in your machine

476
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,120
and all that and it doesn't matter how

477
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,520
much of it you buy every second

478
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,320
then yeah then then don't worry just

479
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,820
don't worry about the 1500 I guess but

480
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,580
I'm just saying that's what this was 20

481
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,140
off has a high compression slow

482
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,220
masticating juicer to preserve the

483
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,220
nutrients

484
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,840
and it pays for itself so that's why it

485
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,400
was all about that I haven't talked

486
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,539
about it in months and stuff and all

487
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,340
that and

488
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,140
I've been so busy with the books and

489
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,880
everything else it's good for you guys

490
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,460
to know if you did buy another juicer

491
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,919
just so you know that down the road you

492
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,900
could save up get the mm-1500 and save

493
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,760
money and it'll pay for the juicer you

494
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,799
once bought that didn't save you money

495
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,280
so it'll pay for that plus your new

496
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,280
juicer

497
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,120
choose your talk

498
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:41,120
okay let's get into it vagus nerve

499
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,559
your inflamed cranial nerve section

500
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,360
inside the book is epic I say that

501
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,179
because it's Advanced it's ahead of

502
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,100
research in science it's mind-blowing

503
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,020
and it basically

504
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,760
tell us the story of why we're dealing

505
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,140
with so many neurological conditions so

506
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,059
if you're anybody that has struggled

507
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,400
with neurological fatigue like fatigue

508
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:05,640
or anything else in your life

509
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,320
the information in this section is just

510
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,059
it's so important it's just epic so

511
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,220
let's go into it a little bit

512
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:13,200
inflammation of the cranial nerves play

513
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,480
a large role in chronic mystery illness

514
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,460
and that's what medical research and

515
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,100
science doesn't know

516
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,320
that the cranial nerves being inflamed

517
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,260
the subtle inflammation that they don't

518
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,179
realize plays a role in all of our

519
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,480
neurological symptoms

520
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,000
this is a huge deal right here

521
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,919
I also say mystery illness is a much

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,059
broader category than anybody realizes

523
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,919
you know what I was talking about

524
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:40,140
earlier you guys you can get a diagnosis

525
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,620
of vertigo but you don't have an answer

526
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,840
or know why you have vertigo

527
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,880
a doctor can give you a diagnosis for

528
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,400
vertigo but not give you the answer that

529
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,400
it's your vagus nerves being inflamed

530
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,679
and why they're inflamed so not only

531
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,720
unless they took medical medium info

532
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,299
right

533
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,280
but not only when you get that vertigo

534
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,840
diagnosis or feeling like your balance

535
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,700
that mystery balance issue you've been

536
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,080
through all the MRIs you got all the CAT

537
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,020
scans

538
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,820
you got all the brain scans it's still a

539
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,340
mystery but you got this bit dizziness

540
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,260
and balance issues and vertigo and all

541
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,760
that even if it's temporary in your life

542
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,100
the point is

543
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,980
is they can give you the label of

544
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:27,960
vertigo or Meniere's disease

545
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:30,240
but they can't give you how why or where

546
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,660
it doesn't exist in the medical world

547
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,700
both alternative and conventional

548
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,220
same thing if they give you a Bell's

549
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,679
Palsy diagnosis or a fatigue diagnosis

550
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,320
or an anxiety diagnosis they still can't

551
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,179
give you the answers to why you have it

552
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,160
and they don't know it's the cranial

553
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,840
nerves being inflamed or which cranial

554
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,260
nerve is in flame that can give you the

555
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,260
anxiety

556
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,419
anyone who has struggled with any

557
00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:00,000
chronic health issue knows this isn't

558
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,679
how it works you guys know if you've

559
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
been to the doctor you know that when

560
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,120
you get an answer

561
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,679
of a diagnosis or not even a diagnosis

562
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,600
maybe you didn't even get one and you're

563
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,419
on your tenth doctor but when you do get

564
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,059
a diagnosis it's still not an answer to

565
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:17,039
why or how

566
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,419
so you're being handed a label for your

567
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,940
set of symptoms

568
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,559
that's not the same as receiving answers

569
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,900
about why those symptoms aren't

570
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,280
interrupting your life in the first

571
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,200
place

572
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,480
so that's important to know and I wanted

573
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,280
to run that you like when I read this

574
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,419
section there's so many places to talk

575
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,419
about but that was a really

576
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:41,880
important Place cranial nerve answers

577
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,559
your cranial nerves include your vagus

578
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,020
nerves your trigeminal nerves and your

579
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,860
facial nerves among others right

580
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,080
hypoglossal nerve that's another one

581
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,659
right there olofactor nerve right

582
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,020
Factory nerve and then your optic nerves

583
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:57,539
you got all your cranial nerves

584
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,940
these are the places that get inflamed

585
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,860
and then we have problems we end up with

586
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,320
the brain fog we end up with the

587
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,900
Twitches spasms we end up with the

588
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,880
tingles and numbness we end up with the

589
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,100
migraines we end up with the trigeminal

590
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,840
neuralgia we end up with the bell's

591
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,760
palsy we end up with all kinds of

592
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:18,780
different things

593
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,799
twitching nose blurry eyes where your

594
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,940
eye doctor's like well there's nothing

595
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,900
wrong with your eyes you got the blurry

596
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,299
eyes right

597
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,640
so whatever happens the cranial nerves

598
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,500
get this mild inflammation and within

599
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,600
this mild inflammation we end up with

600
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,460
symptoms we go to doctor to doctor and

601
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,460
nobody knows why we're sick

602
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,240
viral nerve and brain stem inflammation

603
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,780
so let's cover that for a couple of

604
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,780
minutes too

605
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,460
most people with chronic illness don't

606
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,980
have physical injuries to the cranial

607
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,539
nerves keep that in mind so someone has

608
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,539
a chronic mystery symptom or condition

609
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:58,100
they don't have an injury to the vagus

610
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,100
nerve itself

611
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,059
and what you'll find out there that

612
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,039
people say vagus nerve

613
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,140
and so every time I say vagus nerves to

614
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,580
people they go Oh you mean Vegas Turf so

615
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,620
I have to flip it sometimes so that

616
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,880
they'll understand I'll run into this

617
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,140
all the time

618
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,059
but what

619
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,860
people don't realize that the vagus

620
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,179
nerve it's vagus nerves there's two of

621
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,360
them

622
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:23,400
and so when someone has a vagus nerve

623
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,900
injury that's only one of the vagus

624
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,840
nerves

625
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,880
if someone has a vagus nerve

626
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,220
inflammation it's only inflammation of

627
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,679
one nerve not two

628
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,720
if someone has Vegas

629
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,640
influence if someone has inflammation to

630
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,799
the vagus nerves it's both nerves but

631
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,620
there's two nerves it's important to

632
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,480
know and what you'll find out there and

633
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,919
all the lectures that I've had to do but

634
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,140
the vagus nerves and the information of

635
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,240
the books and everything

636
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,980
what's so crazy is when you talk to

637
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,600
somebody that's like trying to learn

638
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,159
about the vagus nerves out there and

639
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,900
everything they'll never say nerves they

640
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,820
think it's one only

641
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,559
had someone tried to lecture me pretty

642
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,120
recently about that saying that they

643
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,559
knew all about the Vegas room like

644
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,320
there's two right and they're like no

645
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,980
there's not I was like yeah there is

646
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,980
there's two

647
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,940
so what is this mysterious inflammation

648
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,919
that happens in our cranial nerves that

649
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,080
actually takes us down to a situation

650
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:22,380
where we can be in our darkest hour and

651
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,480
I mean that here's the crazy thing when

652
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,620
we're dealing with chronic sickness you

653
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,200
guys

654
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,000
for the most part the cranial nerves

655
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,179
play a role especially when it's

656
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,280
Neurological on any level

657
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:37,860
this is where people can be literally on

658
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:42,000
their hands and knees and praying to God

659
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:44,159
like God I'm dying please help me

660
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,380
this is when people really suffer they

661
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,179
have severe fatigue that's your cranial

662
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,980
nerves

663
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:51,659
they have pain in their face that's

664
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,799
their cranial nerves they have pain in

665
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,500
their ears

666
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,179
cranial nerves severe tinnitus ringing

667
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,679
in their ears so bad they can't sleep at

668
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,679
night that's their cranial nerves

669
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,200
burning tongue burning mouth so bad that

670
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,580
they can't even they can't Rectify it

671
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,320
they can't find help that's their

672
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,260
cranial nerves

673
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,299
people out there have been pushed off

674
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,400
the cliff

675
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,679
because their suffering was so great

676
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:24,860
because their cranial nerves were

677
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:29,820
problematic but no doctor or

678
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:32,340
psychiatrist or healer knew it was a

679
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,020
cranial nerve causing that problem but

680
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,760
there was a problem even Underneath It

681
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,980
All the true cause to why the cranial

682
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,299
nerve was inflamed see how advanced this

683
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,299
information is it's incredible

684
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,740
and a lot of people suffer greatly

685
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,960
because of trigeminal nerve being

686
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,860
inflamed facial nerve being inflamed

687
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:57,500
optic nerve being inflamed

688
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,500
have a glossal nerve being inflamed

689
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:03,000
cochlear nerve being inflamed

690
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,580
all of it like suffered greatly to the

691
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,760
point of can't function can't work they

692
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,279
have 50 100 symptoms

693
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,700
it all adds up they've been to 20

694
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,340
doctors 100 doctors all because of

695
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,539
mysterious inflammation in the cranial

696
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,100
nerves

697
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:22,320
when you think about how much that

698
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,400
affects people in their suffering and

699
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,200
struggling

700
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,900
oh my God

701
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,100
let's just talk about it anxiety is a

702
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,720
big one right there there's people with

703
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,760
crippling anxiety

704
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,320
I see stories all the time I hear

705
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,659
stories all the time I have doctors

706
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,940
contact me all the time about crippling

707
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:42,419
anxiety cases

708
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:46,080
and we're dealing with cranial nerves

709
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,520
with the crippling anxiety

710
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,260
of course you guys know in the medical

711
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,299
mean books there's anxiety chapter in

712
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:54,360
the brain saver book that's mind-blowing

713
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:56,340
when you read that it's like whoa It's

714
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,200
so detailed

715
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,120
so let's go into the little bit the tree

716
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,520
branch effect right here

717
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,080
the cranial nerves where inflammation

718
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,240
can be the most common are the

719
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,400
trigeminal nerves

720
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,539
facial nerves

721
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,539
vagus nerves

722
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,980
right vestibular cochlear nerve right

723
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,980
optic nerves

724
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,520
right well Factory nerves right

725
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:30,539
hypoglossal nerves right

726
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,700
anyway all of these can be inflamed the

727
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,039
tree branch effect that's the spirit of

728
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,659
compassion calls it

729
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,720
as I mentioned earlier our cranial

730
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:43,200
nerves occur in pairs which is why I

731
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,120
refer to them in the plural here

732
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,640
which is why I refer to them that way

733
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,000
you'll often hear these nerves referred

734
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,700
in the singular that is the vagus nerve

735
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,039
as though it is one single rope of a

736
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,380
nerve running through your body I say

737
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,620
vagus nerves in the books

738
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,320
because there is a pair of vagus nerves

739
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,140
branches stemming from your brain stem

740
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,140
just as there is a pair of trigeminal

741
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,820
stemming from the brain stem

742
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,419
cranial nerves are like tree branches

743
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,679
you guys and it's pretty cool to

744
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,520
actually see them like tree tree

745
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,520
branches

746
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,919
which can make symptoms complicated and

747
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,919
which also spares us from even greater

748
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:34,080
pain or debilitation

749
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,720
the human body is designed specifically

750
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,400
so that if one nerve or one branch of a

751
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,679
nerve is damaged

752
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,260
whether viral inflammation or car

753
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,380
accident or something else that you have

754
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,000
the other nerve to survive

755
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,580
so what research and science doesn't

756
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,100
know alternate medicine doesn't know is

757
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,480
we were designed with two nerves

758
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,779
protect us

759
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,279
so that if we get injured maimed hurt or

760
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,279
inflamed through viral infection

761
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,900
or inflamed and irritated

762
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,020
from complications of toxic heavy metals

763
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,360
that we have another nerve

764
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,760
that's why when we get Bell's palsy it's

765
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,360
usually one nerve that goes down

766
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,100
and then our face goes like that

767
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,500
Jackie B says oh my God that makes so

768
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,779
much sense I have I've had ear issues

769
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,880
for a long time ringing pain Etc you can

770
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,679
get the pain in the ears here that's the

771
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,840
cranial nerve so you can get the pain so

772
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,760
bad in the ear in the weirdest places

773
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,320
and you go to all these different ears

774
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,120
nose and throat doctors and they don't

775
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,799
know what it is or what's going on they

776
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,520
give you an antibiotic send you out the

777
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,679
door

778
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,700
they can't tell if it's otitis media

779
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,700
they can't tell anything

780
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,279
I mean it's credible information though

781
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,100
about this in through this book and

782
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,360
you'll see how like cool it is and how

783
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,159
much is in here

784
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,960
if someone says oh he doesn't know his

785
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,460
books or anything like that but the way

786
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,899
I read them or anything you have to

787
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,700
realize that

788
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:05,279
I took the information down word from

789
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,320
word from above I had to learn it just

790
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,679
like you guys have to learn it

791
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,200
it's two huge massive books of

792
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,179
complicated incredible Advanced Medical

793
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,679
information

794
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:17,940
I am a student

795
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,760
of

796
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:25,440
Spirit of compassions

797
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,500
information I'm a student and messenger

798
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,820
I've written the books with my own right

799
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,059
hand

800
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,520
from getting the information from above

801
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:38,880
but I still have to memorize and study

802
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,100
and become an expert the books are that

803
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,399
fiercely filled with Incredible

804
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,399
information

805
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,480
Mary Kay says I've only ever heard

806
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:51,960
people refer to them as the vagus nerve

807
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,799
never Vegas nerves until you

808
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,659
and mark my words right here you will

809
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:00,659
eventually see it out there being

810
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:03,360
referred to as vagus nerves as soon as

811
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,520
the vagus nerve experts so they say

812
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,679
learn the truth

813
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,179
from these books and hearing people talk

814
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:16,340
about it they'll then reset themselves

815
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,340
and they won't cite it back to the books

816
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,320
okay the biggest nerve insights what

817
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,440
you'll hear called the vagus nerve is

818
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,700
not just one thick nerve this is

819
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,640
mind-blowing if you want to know a

820
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,020
really powerful vagus nerve piece of

821
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,200
information here

822
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,779
what you'll hear called the vagus nerve

823
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,779
when it's really vagus nerves

824
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,820
is not just one thick nerve that runs

825
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,200
from one end to the other in a perfect

826
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,020
line

827
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,100
the vagus nerves are a larger pair of

828
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:53,760
nerves that leave the head region

829
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:56,760
and travel down to the Torso right

830
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,440
but get this check this out you won't

831
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,679
hear this anywhere

832
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,380
the vagus nerve size and reach make them

833
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,840
more complex than shorter cranial nerves

834
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,960
which is why they deserve specific

835
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,240
attention here and get this it's coming

836
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,799
right now you'll be blown off your seat

837
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,200
if you want a new Vegas nerve

838
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:20,520
information about the Vegas nerves Susan

839
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,919
Oren says I'd spend 25 years going to an

840
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,320
ENT doctor and dentist chiropractor

841
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:28,440
appointments crazy I'm finally learning

842
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,539
this today after all these years

843
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,120
I had to learn it too but I have to

844
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:35,820
learn the information in all eight books

845
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,919
the medical medium books it's a lot of

846
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,200
information to to remember it's a lot of

847
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,559
information to learn I'm a student and a

848
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,559
messenger

849
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,799
the Vegas they're Grapevine check this

850
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,600
out

851
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,179
we can think of the vagus nerve

852
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,700
structure as a grapevine like the other

853
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,580
cranial nerves the vagus nerve Grapevine

854
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:59,820
is split in two as it leaves the brain

855
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,100
stem with those two main Vines branching

856
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,520
off on their own pathways

857
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:07,679
one vagus nerve vine branch could be

858
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,179
inflamed while the other vagus nerve

859
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,179
vine branch is not inflamed

860
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,179
I mean that's insane when you think

861
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,980
about it because think about how

862
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,659
powerful of a piece of information that

863
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,640
is that's why you have a symptom here

864
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,960
but you don't have one here that's why

865
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,820
you got a problem here but you don't

866
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,200
have one here that's why things are

867
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,240
moving too

868
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,220
one Vegas theravine Branch could be

869
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
inflamed while the other Vegas theravine

870
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,700
branch is not inflamed this is a

871
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:35,039
critical part of the human design that

872
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,899
protects us it means that if one of the

873
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,059
vagus nerves is completely inflamed or

874
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:41,279
damaged there may still be a chance of

875
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,899
survival why the other Vegas Fair shares

876
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,460
its functions

877
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:47,279
besides of research doesn't know that

878
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,899
yet they share their functions that is

879
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,880
not known they don't have a study they

880
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:53,039
don't have a test they don't have any

881
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,260
ability to know that

882
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,140
medical research and science here it

883
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,120
says that and here interesting medical

884
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,980
research in science haven't yet

885
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,440
discovered all aspects of the vagus

886
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,480
nurse that came from above

887
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,860
that's not my words

888
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,740
that's the words that Spirit of

889
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,560
compassion specifically made me write

890
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:15,960
in that moment medical research in

891
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,339
science haven't yet discovered all

892
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,339
aspects of the vagus nerves

893
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,500
there are still new discoveries to be

894
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:29,040
had one future Discovery is Vegas nerve

895
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,379
regeneration vnr that is certain parts

896
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,599
of the vagus nerves can regenerate and

897
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,560
regrow themselves if the conditions are

898
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,899
right

899
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,940
medical research and science will also

900
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:41,639
discover that the anatomy of the vagus

901
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,460
nerves is not definitive this is where

902
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,020
it really gets crazy ping says yes it's

903
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,820
a lot of information it's like learning

904
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,679
to be a neurologist it's mind-blowing

905
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,419
yes it is

906
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,679
that's exactly what it is because I know

907
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:55,139
somebody complained and says he doesn't

908
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,140
even know his own books it's like

909
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,180
if I was another Health author my book

910
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,520
would be this big

911
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,780
it'd be one book every three years two

912
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,640
years

913
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,920
it would be one concept you hang your

914
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,020
hat on in the book The Concept would be

915
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
a theory from some study that didn't

916
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,800
work out right

917
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,540
there'd be some keto stuff and some eat

918
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,280
better stuff in there

919
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,200
and then I would take a half a million

920
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,480
dollars and shove it into the in into

921
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,400
getting the book out there through like

922
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,040
the system because that's what they do

923
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,800
and medical medium we don't do that here

924
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,300
but with here's the thing this is this

925
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,220
is actually

926
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,200
but with this information neurologists

927
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,880
in science research don't know yet

928
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,560
so you're getting

929
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,859
like a class

930
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,720
in this a training and education in this

931
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,760
but science research doesn't know this

932
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,460
information yet

933
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,119
okay ready this is really cool medical

934
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,940
research and science will also discover

935
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,280
100 years from now that the anatomy of

936
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,280
the vagus nerves is not definitive

937
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,680
surgeons don't even know this yet the

938
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,540
vagus nerves are not designed the same

939
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,339
way in every person for example the

940
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,220
Vegas nerve branches don't completely

941
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:12,119
connect in the Torso for everybody oh my

942
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,880
God

943
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,900
so the vagus nerve branches don't

944
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,200
completely connect in your torso the

945
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,960
same way somebody else for everybody

946
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,780
in some people the two Vine branches

947
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,880
merely cross over and touch each other

948
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,880
not actually connecting

949
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,000
that's Advanced Medical Research and

950
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,740
science

951
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,240
I remember when Spirit compassion was

952
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,500
making me write that part down and I was

953
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,500
just like it what

954
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,240
the vagus nerves also vary in length in

955
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,380
each person what

956
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,960
what

957
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,200
the vagus nerves think about that also

958
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,900
vary in length in each person

959
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,920
Melanie says oh my God that's why I have

960
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,200
restless legs only on one side correct

961
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,700
the Vegas nerves also vary in length in

962
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,280
each person I could read that line 100

963
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,140
times because that is so mind-blowing it

964
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,700
is unbelievable you can go to any course

965
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,680
or class you can go to medical school

966
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,200
and they won't teach you that there

967
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,380
you can spend a million dollars in the

968
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,300
best medical school there ever was

969
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,859
some ivy league medical school and they

970
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,820
won't teach you that bit of piece of

971
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:25,820
information right there

972
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,640
if anything's glitching there will be a

973
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,640
replay you can watch this again at

974
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,560
medicalme.com under brain shot therapy

975
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,900
video replays you have to find that

976
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,240
section on medicalme.com click that part

977
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,240
and you can watch it the replay

978
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,380
okay

979
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,560
this discovery is going to be forced

980
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,859
upon the medical industry due to robotic

981
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,900
surgeries what where robots programmed

982
00:37:55,859 --> 00:38:00,240
to perform surgery end up injuring

983
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,400
patients vagus nerves because the

984
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,780
calculations are so unpredictable from

985
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,780
person to person did you hear that

986
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,480
did you hear that like what

987
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:15,900
I forgot that was even in here

988
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,160
and I've like gone over these books

989
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:22,980
day in day out 20 hours 22 hours a day

990
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,079
this discovery of the Vegas nerves

991
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,900
varying in length and each person is

992
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,359
going to be forced upon the medical

993
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,339
industry due to the robotic surgeries

994
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,640
where the robots programmed to perform

995
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:37,380
surgery end up cutting injuring patients

996
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,060
vagus nerves because the calculations

997
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,200
are so unpredictable from person to

998
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,200
person can you believe that

999
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,280
my God

1000
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,300
a health author can hang their hat on

1001
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,240
that one little Discovery right there

1002
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,700
and write a book about it and put it out

1003
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,160
there that's how just that concept alone

1004
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,960
and there's hundreds of these these

1005
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,260
incredible pieces of Truth in these

1006
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,260
books

1007
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,980
this chapter belows me away

1008
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:13,200
medical communities are going to start

1009
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,020
finding out that the vagus nerves length

1010
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,940
length growth size and directions of

1011
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,700
travel are not as cookie cutter as

1012
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,740
previously assumed how do you like that

1013
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,180
but don't worry once these books are out

1014
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,720
which is now

1015
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,640
some vagus nerve experty person who does

1016
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,320
exercises or whatever is going to take

1017
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,940
that piece of information and teach in

1018
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,440
their classes and never tell one of

1019
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,300
their students where it came from and

1020
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,040
originated from

1021
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,280
please share these Challenge videos by

1022
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,280
the way

1023
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,520
the vagus nerves are made up of tiny

1024
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,680
strands and strings of nerve cells that

1025
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,240
run the length of the nerves a vagus

1026
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,579
nerve is not just one solid nerve

1027
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,020
it's a complex weave of nerve cells this

1028
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:58,140
is similar to how the other cranial

1029
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,060
nerves work although not identical this

1030
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,640
is this complexity Works in our favor

1031
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,440
when vagus nerve inflammation occurs it

1032
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,599
may affect multiple strings within a

1033
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,380
vagus nerve yet not every single string

1034
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,839
of the nerve no one knows that part ever

1035
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,000
Natalia says that's not that's how

1036
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,960
medical discoveries happen by injuring

1037
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,060
people

1038
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,740
brilliant brilliant no brilliant that's

1039
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,500
incredible

1040
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,359
you're over there on YouTube

1041
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,339
that's how medical discoveries happen by

1042
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,300
injuring people

1043
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,300
oh you're asking

1044
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:33,119
um yes

1045
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
for instance like the robotic surgeries

1046
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,000
the surgeries that they're developing

1047
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,220
right they're creating they're building

1048
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,839
and perfecting trying to perfect robots

1049
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,240
for surgeries

1050
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,140
but they've had to put the robots aside

1051
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,300
because

1052
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,800
robots are also really dangerous what

1053
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,480
happens with the Vegas nerve they're

1054
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,339
going to discover the vagus nerve is

1055
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,900
different length in everybody because

1056
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:53,400
they're going to accidentally be cutting

1057
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,560
the nerve in half through robotic

1058
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,300
surgeries so when a patient's on the

1059
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,820
operation table

1060
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,619
the robot is going to accidentally when

1061
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,859
it cuts it's going to cut someone's

1062
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,660
vagus nerves in half not realizing that

1063
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,680
each person's is a different length

1064
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,119
that's how they're going to learn about

1065
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,300
the different lengths through it to

1066
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,119
catastrophe like that epic you know epic

1067
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:19,260
Carolina says what page are we reading

1068
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:23,359
from 102 page 102 of brain saver right

1069
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,359
here not for brain saver protocols

1070
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,280
medical communities are going to start

1071
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,140
finding out that the vagus nerves length

1072
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,359
growth size and directions of travel are

1073
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,579
not as cookie cutters previously assume

1074
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,079
the vagus nerves are made up of the tiny

1075
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,359
strands I talked about which is another

1076
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,640
incredible thing this means inflammation

1077
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,980
does not take over an entire vagus nerve

1078
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,599
I talked about that okay here we go it

1079
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,839
also means symptoms can move and shift

1080
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,300
so vagus nerve cells are in these

1081
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:53,160
strands so one section of your vagus

1082
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,720
nerve can be inflamed like through like

1083
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,339
Epstein-Barr some kind of viral

1084
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,680
neurotoxin that we talk about in all the

1085
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,420
medical mean books that that advance in

1086
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,820
information that's very compassionate

1087
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,560
gave us for years now in these books you

1088
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,079
can have this inflammation in half your

1089
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,420
vagus nerve causing symptoms to vary and

1090
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,560
go actually causing neurological

1091
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,359
symptoms to make you feel like you're

1092
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,020
going insane and the doctor doesn't

1093
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,020
understand you

1094
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,540
I can go on you guys there's so much

1095
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,040
information in here about the vagus

1096
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,280
nerve

1097
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,079
and cranial nerves you guys

1098
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,400
we're in the brain saver book we're in

1099
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,560
the brain saver challenge let's start

1100
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,240
making the nerve shifter shot I think

1101
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,740
that's someplace we can go we talked

1102
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,200
about a lot of different aspects of it

1103
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,700
we're in shifter shots let's read about

1104
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,680
shifter shots for a couple seconds

1105
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,839
because that's what we're doing

1106
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,940
the world is getting so complicated in

1107
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,740
so many ways and we've been being pushed

1108
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,540
in so many different directions it's

1109
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,640
easy to get confused or stuck in a

1110
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,339
pattern and to shift your shots like the

1111
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,320
nerve shifter break that pattern

1112
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,560
how incredible is that

1113
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,900
when you think about that right there

1114
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,240
breaking that pattern

1115
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,940
are we in half time right now we're in

1116
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,840
half time before we make the shot

1117
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,000
you guys want to do the robot with me

1118
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,700
[Music]

1119
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,520
that's not the robot

1120
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,310
that's not the robot get it right

1121
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:19,140
that's not the robot

1122
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:22,640
[Music]

1123
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,640
we're doing the talking robot

1124
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:30,000
[Music]

1125
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:32,040
you guys can do a better one break dance

1126
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,680
all right so let's get you guys we're

1127
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,319
out of the half time right now

1128
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:39,420
if robots will cut through the vagus

1129
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,480
nerves why aren't regular surgeons

1130
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,700
already cutting them regular surgeons

1131
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,800
are already cutting them but the problem

1132
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,079
is with regular surgeons regular

1133
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,599
surgeons already accidentally cut a lot

1134
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,420
of things in people but the regular

1135
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,740
surgeon is looking at the Vegas nerve

1136
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,900
but doesn't know it's a different length

1137
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,660
than somebody else's but what's happens

1138
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,480
is they dial in the robots

1139
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,700
how the body's built and the robot

1140
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,859
accidentally cuts through because they

1141
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,180
can never calculate each person each

1142
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:12,000
person's vagus nerve is a different

1143
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,619
length but an individual surgeon opens

1144
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,480
you up and sees a Vegas nerve not

1145
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,099
realizing it's a different length but he

1146
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,839
sees it but yes he can still

1147
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:21,780
accidentally cut it because surgeons

1148
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,880
accidentally cut everything

1149
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,280
all right guys we're out of our halftime

1150
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,500
intermission

1151
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,099
so we're in the

1152
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:35,700
let's make the shifter shot right here

1153
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,560
we're day nine if you just got in here

1154
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,140
how cool is that

1155
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,660
I'm pumped about the day nine

1156
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,760
MB Doom I didn't expect it but I think

1157
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:49,520
this shot might be the most important

1158
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,520
one for me it's clearing so much pain

1159
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,640
that's why I do what I do because if I

1160
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,940
can give you pain relief

1161
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,220
with sfc's information it means

1162
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:05,160
everything Christine says just order the

1163
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,380
mm-1500 gray is sold out I got the blue

1164
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,480
I love the blue one I have the blue and

1165
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,920
gray one the blue and kind of like

1166
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,079
silver gray one

1167
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,540
I love the blue one

1168
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,200
it's incredible

1169
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,200
all right

1170
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,560
let's get into it a little bit

1171
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,480
let's start with the lime

1172
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,300
let's peel it

1173
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,160
so I'm peeling the lime right now as you

1174
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,780
can see

1175
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,400
so it says

1176
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,400
Porter lime peeled

1177
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,060
so

1178
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,920
now if your lime is not that juicy use a

1179
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,819
little bit more

1180
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,700
if your lime is really juicy you might

1181
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:54,300
use just your quarter if your lime is

1182
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:57,240
huge like you got a big lime

1183
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,119
you can like gauge that as well they

1184
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,520
don't have to be Precision perfect but

1185
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,619
you want to get close to it so I'm going

1186
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,720
to do a quarter of a lime right here

1187
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:09,800
peeled

1188
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,800
getting my ingredients ready

1189
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,619
all right

1190
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,300
so we got the lime I got a quarter of a

1191
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:21,560
lime peeled right here quarter cup

1192
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,560
tightly packed spinach

1193
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:28,280
[Music]

1194
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,280
let's get you in there

1195
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:36,720
so quarter cup tightly packed that's

1196
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:40,020
about it right there

1197
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:44,599
if I was to pack that in

1198
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,599
all right so now we need a quarter cup

1199
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,140
roughly chopped kale

1200
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:56,599
get a quarter cup going

1201
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,599
okay

1202
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,940
now you know what I've measured a

1203
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,099
billion times because obviously I've

1204
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,599
made these

1205
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:09,480
so I've got a really good idea with my

1206
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:11,760
hands of what that is plus I also

1207
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,720
have a voice talking to me

1208
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,099
quarter cup tightly packed are roughly

1209
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,099
chopped lettuce is next

1210
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,640
try to get any lettuce that you like or

1211
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,339
whatever I mean honestly butter Leaf I

1212
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,540
like so I'm doing butter leaf I love it

1213
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:30,680
for that

1214
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,680
Green Leaf is fine

1215
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,380
quarter cup tightly packed Cilantro's

1216
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,380
next

1217
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:40,980
so

1218
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,900
that's about that right there for

1219
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,180
quarter cup

1220
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,720
got that in here quarter cup tightly

1221
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,720
packed

1222
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,079
parsley

1223
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,079
foreign

1224
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,900
medium asparagus stocks

1225
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,800
that's kind of a smaller one I'm gonna

1226
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,800
go with a medium right there

1227
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:12,720
there you are

1228
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,280
now you can call them Spears stalks I

1229
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,280
might go with this one there you go

1230
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,099
shoots

1231
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,500
awesome and then a half a stalk of

1232
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:29,099
celery now okay let's get this straight

1233
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,079
I see some of you guys social media have

1234
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:34,079
been when when you're thinking like half

1235
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:36,180
a stalk of celery I see some of you guys

1236
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:40,579
are using half of a whole bunch of

1237
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,579
celery so say you got a bunch of celery

1238
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:45,960
instead of like taking one stock off

1239
00:48:43,859 --> 00:48:49,430
breaking in half like you're supposed to

1240
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:52,440
and running it through

1241
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:55,859
[Applause]

1242
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,440
you're doing a whole half a bunch

1243
00:48:55,859 --> 00:49:01,200
that's not gonna work

1244
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,420
so you have to go with a half a stock a

1245
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,099
half a stock is one really important to

1246
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,099
know okay we got it

1247
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,880
incredible I love how quiet that juicer

1248
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:26,220

1254
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:43,140
this is a nerve shifter and I I can use

1255
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,240
a nerve shifter

1256
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,640
I get nervous sometimes when I come on

1257
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,640
here and I go live

1258
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,520
this is not pre-recorded I can make a

1259
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,050
terrible mistake by saying a bad word

1260
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,460

1297
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:40,559
and I remember when I took that first

1298
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:42,720
sip that did the same thing to me it

1299
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:47,000
puts a smile on my face

1300
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,000
it's going to the brand fast

1301
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,059
why does your face pain go away in 10

1302
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,380
minutes

1303
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:57,119
because

1304
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:59,760
the nerve shifter goes into the neurons

1305
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,240
where the brain stem is and it hits

1306
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:08,780
those cranial nerves

1307
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,780
and it's really a miracle it's a miracle

1308
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,800
these books

1309
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,619
are the greatest books of all time

1310
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,859
spread the word they are and and you can

1311
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:23,339
be proud that you're actually straight

1312
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:24,839
up being truthful because these are the

1313
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:26,280
greatest books of all time it's

1314
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:27,960
undeniable

1315
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,700
when you read them and what you see in

1316
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,540
them and the Miracles that are in these

1317
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,099
books

1318
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,240
they are the greatest books in health

1319
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,059
history

1320
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,760
I can judge these books

1321
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,800
and I've I've known that the medical

1322
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,359
medium books are all incredible books

1323
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,020
and the best health books that we have

1324
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:48,839
in history but I've never said that

1325
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,460
I never said that these two like this is

1326
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:51,599
different or these are the greatest

1327
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,119
books

1328
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,619
in health history right now that were

1329
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:58,559
released

1330
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:00,000
because it was the next level and of

1331
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,740
course all the medical media books have

1332
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,260
saved lives and they're all Next Level

1333
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,839
and they're all Frontier information

1334
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:09,300
Advanced science and against science and

1335
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:11,460
research Advance far above it but the

1336
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,440
point is is that these books are the

1337
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,000
greatest books of all time you'll know

the books on amazon.com if you can

this way people can find their way and

1362
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,900
they see these reviews and it matters

1363
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,119
people make decisions and I can't tell

1364
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:16,980
you every time the trolls come in and

1365
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,020
try to hit the books on the one stars

1366
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,200
and then people come in and they go well

1367
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:24,300
I'm not sure about that medical medium

1368
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,819
I'm not sure about his brain saver book

1369
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,980
because this one star called him you

1370
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:30,540
know a putz and says he's just ugly and

1371
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,440
stupid and everything else and I don't

1372
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,480
think

1373
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,460
I don't think I want to get the book now

1374
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,380
well you just lost your chance to heal

1375
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,000
you're going to see another 10 doctors

1376
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,500
and maybe 10 years later you'll come

1377
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,660
back to the books but the point is is

1378
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,339
the reviews helpful so people can find

1379
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:47,099
their way

1380
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,940
if you like the books if you like the

1381
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:50,460
books

1382
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,440
and how do you clean your book they come

1383
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,180
dirty sometimes through Amazon because

1384
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,740
on the Amazon conveyor belt they get

1385
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:57,660
thrown on the conveyor belt the conveyor

1386
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:59,880
belts are greasy

1387
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,859
so your brand new pristine books

1388
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,440
depending on what Warehouse or where

1389
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:06,839
could have a smudge on it take a you

1390
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,880
know a damp washcloth put a little soap

1391
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:11,940
on there and clean it off incredible

1392
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,800
right and look out for imposters

1393
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:16,140

the books talk about some fun stuff and

1422
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,520

about it you guys know I work with them

1430
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:31,440
I fully endorse them because of the fact

1431
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,960
that it's that good slow masticating

1432
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,619
cold pressed juicer saves people money

1433
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:40,260
it's juicing more the the pulp is dry

1434
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,540
the other juicers don't do that even if

1435
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,940
they say they do they actually don't

1436
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,859
that's the game played it's a dog eat

1437
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,980
dog world

1438
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,839
that's what it is

1439
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,220
and they come in and they just take

1440
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:58,140
advantage of people

1441
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:59,220
and they lie it's a dog eat dog world

1442
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,780
um

1443
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,420
so yeah

1444
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:06,119
the question there can't you have a

1445
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:09,240
phone call or you can answer emails so

1446
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:11,339
you can personally help the list of

1447
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,619
people that were trying to reach me for

1448
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:17,400
help reached into the millions many

1449
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:19,319
years ago a lottery system that we had

1450
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,980
many years ago

1451
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:25,079
the whole thing was just sad

1452
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,020
I could not reach that many people

1453
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:30,839
millions of sick people around the world

1454
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:33,900
my doctor friends and many other people

1455
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:36,480
through the years said aw when are you

1456
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,400
gonna write the Books

1457
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,780
Spirit of compassion wanted me to start

1458
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:46,020
writing the books over 20 plus years ago

1459
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:48,540
situation in life didn't lead me to be

1460
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:51,300
able to write them over 20 25 years ago

1461
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:53,640
because I was busy helping out people by

1462
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,420
the thousands one-on-one seven days a

1463
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,460
week

1464
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,819
and what happened was

1465
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:01,260
the too many people needed my help and I

1466
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:03,480
could not keep up with it it was

1467
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,640
virtually impossible seven days a week

1468
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:10,500
for years no vacation ever for decades

1469
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:13,319
including on call throughout the middle

1470
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,359
of the night for emergencies an

1471
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:17,579
emergency line for doctors

1472
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,640
to reach me in the middle of the night I

1473
00:58:17,579 --> 00:58:23,760
didn't sleep for decades I worked very

1474
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,099
hard and spirit of compassion said it's

1475
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,619
time to get the information to the world

1476
00:58:26,099 --> 00:58:31,680
so Millions can receive that information

1477
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:34,200
in the books so they don't need a

1478
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,059
consultation and so they can educate

1479
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,799
their doctors themselves become their

1480
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,020
own experts and work on their healing

1481
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:42,660
process and have access to these Miracle

1482
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:44,940
tools which is happening

1483
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:48,059
so I hope that answers the question

1484
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,619
the books are one book so you have to

1485
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:51,720
get both

1486
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:53,220
but it's two books

1487
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,079
see

1488
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:57,119
it was one book originally and the

1489
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:58,740
publisher couldn't publish it

1490
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,760
where they couldn't put it out there and

1491
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,460
print it

1492
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:04,980
and so it had to be split in two it's

1493
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,619
two massive books 600 pages

1494
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:10,200
there's 12 books in both books meaning

1495
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:13,079
six books and six books 12 books worth

1496
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,559
it's packed and jammed

1497
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:20,900
I wrote it mostly in one year

1498
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,900
and I did 20 hour days

1499
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:24,299
and

1500
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,760
they are done and in your hands

1501
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:28,980
incredible

1502
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:31,819
anyway I do free lives I do free

1503
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,440
podcasts free information on the website

1504
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:36,059
everything's free free you can become

1505
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,160
your expert for free you can get the

1506
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:40,740
books in the library for free

1507
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,359
that's how it should be because the

1508
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:45,240
chronically ill

1509
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,460
most everybody who's chronically sick

1510
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:50,280
doesn't have a lot of money

1511
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:52,740
I want free wherever we can because it's

1512
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:56,579
the mission to get people better I could

1513
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,960
put a paywall in up front of everything

1514
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:59,880
I do

1515
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,619
everything

1516
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,480
and you can get real creative with

1517
01:00:01,619 --> 01:00:05,339
paywalls and subscriptions and all that

1518
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:09,599
real creative

1519
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:12,420
how we can do merch merchandise and

1520
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,339
creative pay walls left and right

1521
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,160
and no one will have access to the

1522
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:19,559
medical meme information unless they pay

1523
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,380
whether they like me or not we won't do

1524
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:24,059
that nope in fact

1525
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,680
what you'll notice on my YouTubes

1526
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:27,420
there's no commercials and advertisers

1527
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,059
before you watch a YouTube what you'll

1528
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,260
notice in front of my podcast at Apple

1529
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,359
podcast

1530
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,760
you'll notice there's no commercials and

1531
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,520
advertisers in front of my podcasts

1532
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:41,099
so even with all that said and done

1533
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:44,480
we're the only podcast at the level that

1534
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:44,480
we are because it's a number one podcast

1535
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,859
there's no advertisers and commercials

1536
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,859
in front of it

1537
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,660
and it's very special

1538
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,200
I pay out of pocket to do my podcast

1539
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:01,319
I pay out of my pocket to do everything

1540
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:03,299
that's the mission and the books costs a

1541
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:06,000
lot of money to print and ship around

1542
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:08,040
the world so people have access to them

1543
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,240
and so that's why there is a fee for the

1544
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,040
book unless you want to go to the

1545
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,720
library and get it for free

1546
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,640
and someone said hey why don't you just

1547
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,559
put a PDF on your website well then

1548
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,960
someone in a bookstore is not going to

1549
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,640
be able to see that PDF and somebody

1550
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,140
who's in the library is not going to be

1551
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,280
able to see it as someone who's looking

1552
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,960
for the books not going to be able to

1553
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,799
see it the books are shipped around the

1554
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,140
world

1555
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:30,180
and they're in almost they're gonna be

1556
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,920

1557
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,900
medical mean books are in almost every

1558
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,940

many more people

1563
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:45,180
and just when you don't have to rely on

1564
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,280
the internet too because the internet

1565
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,660
could go bye-bye

1566
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,819
