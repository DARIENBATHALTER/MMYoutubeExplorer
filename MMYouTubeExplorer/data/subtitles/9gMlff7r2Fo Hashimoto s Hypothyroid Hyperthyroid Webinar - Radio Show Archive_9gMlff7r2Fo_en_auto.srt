with your phone or something else why

22
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,480
you're in the middle of the book and

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,320
skip over a part that's so critical or

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,039
important and not realize it it it's so

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,399
easy to happen that way cuz we live in a

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,199
world of distraction So reading it again

27
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,360
you might all of a sudden hit that spot

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,000
and be like whoa wait a minute what or a

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
couple of different spots so I don't

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,759
want you to lose anything that's in

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,200
there um so uh hopefully some of you

32
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:19,640

going to be talking about a lot of great

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,600
stuff here like I said before I'm

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,320
honored that you're with me on this

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:34,560
webinar right here um it's an important

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,399
webinar it's an important time and you

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,200
know knowing the truth about

41
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:45,719
something um is that powerful is truly

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,759
that powerful and it means it means a

43
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,799
lot of freedom it means a lot of freedom

44
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,000
you know not every truth has Freedom

45
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,119
attached to it you know you've heard the

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,479
saying oh there's still okay who's truth

47
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,960
this truth that truth what is a truth is

48
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,719
it not everybody claims the truth and um

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,799
but what happens is is that the reason

50
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,239
why truth is so confusing in so many

51
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,440
different ways is because truth is

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,840
backed by things that makes

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,879
it kind of a a false truth so truth gets

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,160
backed by things it gets backed by

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,879
medical funding you know with lots of

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,080
strings attached it gets backed by

57
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,879
internal Kickbacks and persuaded belief

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,160
systems and private panels of

59
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,599
influencers and health field pay offs it

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,480
gets backed by trendy traps and

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,800
different interest groups it gets backed

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,280
by things and that's why it's could be

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,599
truthful some of it out there in the

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
world of Internet information about

65
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,680
thyroid or books or experts working on

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,720
it but there could be pieces in there

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,800
missing there could be pieces that are

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,200
skewed like the thumb on the scale

69
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,959
because it has stuff attached to it the

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
information in here doesn't have any

71
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,560
contamination attached to it so the

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,480
information you have in front of you is

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,239
clean it's clean it's not attached to

74
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,200
something that's conditional something

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,000
that's conditional that might have

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,840
altered it or made it just right so it

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,440
fits into the world

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,879
today that's not how it should be you

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,280
need to know the truth about your health

80
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,200
you need to know the truth about your

81
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,799
thyroid you need to learn these things

82
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,239
it's so important to learn these things

83
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,439
it is so important to know

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,159
what the truth really is with healing

85
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,319
and your thyroid in general with

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,400
anything and so that information here

87
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,720
comes from a pure place untampered with

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Place Advanced Clean Source a higher

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,159
source and that's what the information

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,439
is in here and that's what it is you

91
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,840
know painstakingly I took the

92
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:58,040
information down from my source um day

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,840
in day out day in and day out and made

94
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:06,480
sure it was in there just the way my

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,120
source wanted it to be and um and so

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
this doesn't have the thumb scale on it

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,319
this doesn't have the dollars behind it

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,600
this doesn't have things that make make

99
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,000
it and shape it into something that fits

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
just right so that all the interest

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
groups out there in the medical Fields

102
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
both conventional and alternative are

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,840
happy no that's not what this is about

104
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,160
this is about making you happy this is

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,759
about meaning making you better not just

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,479
not about making you happy making you

107
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,759
better make giving you that freedom a

108
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,600
false happiness this is the freedom that

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,720
we

110
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:45,479
need and um and to and to be a part of

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,240
it together blows me away to be a part

112
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,639
of it together blows me away seriously

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,560
it really does so we're talking about

114
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,240
Hashimoto today we're talking about

115
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,759
Hashimoto we're talking about

116
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,479
hyperthyroidism we're talking about

117
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,360
hypothyroidism we're just talking about

118
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,759
we're going to just Bop around and talk

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,400
about a lot of different things there's

120
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,520
cool stuff going on with all of it um

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,880
I'm going to start a little bit with I

122
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,280
think I'll start a little bit with

123
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,120
history a little bit with history just

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,800
about Hashimoto in general you know when

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
you get diagnosed with

126
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,199
Hashimoto you should think okay well I

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,639
have something here meaning meaning

128
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,960
science and research is there they're

129
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,080
there they know they get it Hashimoto

130
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,600
science and

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:37,560
research there's nothing scientific or

132
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,720
research about Hashimoto yet yet I'm

133
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,639
just going to tell you right now that's

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,199
what one of the saddest parts of it all

135
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,600
is first of all it's discovered back in

136
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,440
the early 1900s how by a physician

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,560
putting his hand on a patient's throat

138
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,680
and feeling that there might have been

139
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,560
some

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,160
inflammation and that's with thyroiditis

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,319
was that was the birth of thyroiditis

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Hashimoto thyroiditis there it is that

143
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,280
was the birth of it that was the birth

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:10,319
of it and the only thing that's come out

145
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,360
of it since then the only thing that's

146
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,400
come out of it since then which is a

147
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,599
theory a

148
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,160
theory okay is the discovery of an

149
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:24,360
antibody discovery of an auto

150
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,639
antibody that Discovery okay but but not

151
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,639
knowing what Auto antibodies do you guys

152
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,199
not knowing what they do not having any

153
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,080
clue any idea aidea just

154
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,000
theoretically believing that an auto

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,160
antibody is creating inflammation and

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
attacking your thyroid that was just a

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,440
theory that was a theory because it was

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,080
the safest one to go to which backed

159
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,520
science and research the reason why it

160
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,000
backed science and

161
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,680
research it backed science and research

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,919
because it put the blame on you your

163
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,560
body that was the safe fault for science

164
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,879
and research is a perfect safe fault

165
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,599
because science of research never wants

166
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:00,199
to admit they're behind the times or

167
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,639
they're in a non-discovery Zone they

168
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,560
hate it they hate it they hate it they

169
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,360
hate feeling or knowing that the

170
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,840
billions of dollars and the trillions of

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,000
dollars that have gone into science and

172
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,199
research about anything they hate

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,319
knowing it hasn't amounted to

174
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,080
anything they hate that and so they have

175
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,879
to take theories and they have to make

176
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,080
them law law law of the land which only

177
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,000
hurts you law of the land that only

178
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,919
hurts you and that becomes false truth

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,080
that becomes false

180
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,520
truth that's what that becomes and then

181
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,919
it becomes law of the land a fake truth

182
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,319
a false truth becomes law of the

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,520
land so Hashimoto is this so this only

184
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,800
other thing that came out of Hashimoto

185
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,159
in science is there was this discovery

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,240
of of of a random Auto

187
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:00,159
antibody with no identification of what

188
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,280
it does or where it even goes where it

189
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:07,319
even goes what it

190
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,080
does nothing nothing just a

191
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,479
theory attached to it it must be why you

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,639
get

193
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,759
thyroiditis and that's how bad things

194
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,440
are that's how sad things are and that's

195
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,800
where we are with the most advanced in

196
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,319
in in in thyroid and somebody one of you

197
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,879
might be out there saying well no not

198
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,840
true there's all these triggers and all

199
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,159
this other stuff we're going to talk

200
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
about triggers

201
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,599
we're going to talk about

202
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,479
triggers but but and you'll see there's

203
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,800
a list of triggers actually that I put

204
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,479
in there you'll see it the list of

205
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,880
triggers but they're just triggers

206
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,680
they're not the cause they're just

207
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,959
triggers they're just triggers just like

208
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,959
anything just like any kind of

209
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:56,880
trigger just a trigger so so the theory

210
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
was the only thing that came next after

211
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,560
all that 10 and something years here we

212
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:06,640
we are what year is it now and look two

213
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,560
things came out of Hashimoto's

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,200
thyroiditis two things a guy feeling

215
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,880
somebody's thyroid which named it

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,519
Hashimoto's

217
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,519
thyroiditis and a guy 50 years later a

218
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,320
guy 50 years later a doctor 50 years

219
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,480
later finding an auto antibody but not

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,560
having a clue to what it does so it was

221
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,279
a madeup

222
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,279
theory compounded

223
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,279
that was basically well this is probably

224
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:38,000
what it's doing let's do this it's the

225
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:41,760
safest way out let's create the

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,320
autoimmune fallacy the autoimmune Theory

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,440
the autoimmune theory of your body

228
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,120
destroying itself cuz you know why it it

229
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,720
sets it protects science and research

230
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,440
till the cows come home till the cows

231
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,519
come home it protects and protects and

232
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,240
protects and protects like you don't

233
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,279
even know because it's your fault that's

234
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,120
your body being faulty and since they

235
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,240
still don't have answers to what causes

236
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,920
anything it becomes your genes now and

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,320
you'll see a little genan section in

238
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,320
this book read that read that baby like

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,079
three four times that Gene

240
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,920
section you have to Deb brainwash

241
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,600
yourself it's so critical it's so

242
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,040
critical to Healing it's so critical to

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,200
the conditioning that

244
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,760
occurs so this is an important step this

245
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,440
is an important

246
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,160
step right here where we are in history

247
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,000
right

248
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,639
now this information is an important

249
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
step in history right now this just

250
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:50,519
isn't just a book you

251
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,320
know is isn't a book to do anything like

252
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,800
further my career or anything like that

253
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
it's not that's not what it is you know

254
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,800
it's a funny thing someone even said to

255
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,839
me ah you

256
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,120
authors this isn't a memoir this isn't

257
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,279
you know yeah I'd love to do something

258
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,240
silly like uh a whole book on on the

259
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,880
medical medium starting from when I was

260
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,519
birthed to to now and in a whole you

261
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,560
know level of the painstaking crap I've

262
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,360
gone through my whole entire life

263
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,600
hearing Spirit it'd be a fun book

264
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,480
meaning to

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,959
read it would just you know further my

266
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,440
career on that way

267
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,839
and that's not what these books are

268
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,200
about I put a little touch the origins

269
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,480
of of of me in the first

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
book but what it's about is getting you

271
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,120
the truth and the information that's all

272
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,279
I care about I I'm not going to be able

273
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,560
to cover the whole book in this webinar

274
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
but we're going to cover what we can but

275
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,320
I had I have to give you the basis of

276
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,440
the understanding of the

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,720
two the two discoveries is all we have

278
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,240
for thyroid meaning the two discoveries

279
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,399
that's signs and research have that

280
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,200
everybody's holding on to literally like

281
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,440
it's like it's

282
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
everything a mystery Auto antibody that

283
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,440
no one knows what's going on or what

284
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,000
it's doing putting the blame on you that

285
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,519
your body's attacking itself and

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,800
destroying itself and destroying the

287
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
thyroid and at the same time the

288
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,519
discovery of hasimoto to begin with some

289
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,079
guy some guy felt a swollen thyroid back

290
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,079
in the early

291
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,560
1900s and let me tell you something I do

292
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,560
respect and appreciate both of those

293
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,760
very

294
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,199
things as much as I sound like I'm

295
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,839
talking down about it I'm talking down

296
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:42,800
about the fact that it becomes law and

297
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,959
nobody just even has a clue or debates

298
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
it or understands any of it nobody in

299
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,120
the professional world of medicine or

300
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
anything and just move just keep on

301
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,079
moving

302
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,760
forward and then you don't get the

303
00:12:53,079 --> 00:13:00,360
answers you need you don't get the truth

304
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,760
you don't you don't get any of that

305
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,440
we're going to talk about Epstein bar a

306
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,560
little bit Epstein bar gets into the

307
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,880
thyroid and that's what causes Hashimoto

308
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,279
we're going to go into it a little

309
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,720
deeper today but you'll see the new

310
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,639
experts that recently took information

311
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,720
from book one the origins you know book

312
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,839
one medical medium they took information

313
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,519
because spirit and I published how it

314
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,720
works with Epstein bar and the thyroid

315
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,120
and everything like that and they took

316
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,000
it and they sprinkled it on their

317
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,839
websites and they sprinkled it in and

318
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
out of their their other kind of books

319
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,120
now thyroid books sprinkle it in and out

320
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,680
because they don't want to be left out

321
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,079
but they call it a trigger because they

322
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,839
just don't trust in the fact of what's

323
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:42,399
going on because they're so married to

324
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:45,120
the laws the two laws a guy in 1950 in

325
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
the 1950s that found an auto antibody

326
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,160
but doesn't know what's going on so the

327
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,399
theory became it's your body attacking

328
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,279
itself and then of course the guy

329
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,880
Hashimoto felt the thyroid and felt it

330
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,160
was swollen they don't want to leave

331
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,160
these

332
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,079
laws but that doesn't really protect you

333
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,680
sure you could clean up the diet maybe

334
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,360
get your numbers a little better on the

335
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,360
thyroid but that's not the answer either

336
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,279
entirely this is serious stuff we're

337
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,320
talking about this is serious stuff this

338
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,480
is no

339
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,320
joke this is no

340
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,880
joke

341
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:29,120
so um by the way you

342
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,000
know have your tea have your herbal

343
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,399
whatever you need I got mine right here

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,639
because we're going to go deeper into

345
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,320
this and we got we got a lot of time

346
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
we're going to be doing this so I'm

347
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,320
going to be sipping some tea along the

348
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,759
way being this is live it's uh you know

349
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,279
might get a little dry throat from

350
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,240
talking so much but thank you for just

351
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,720
listening and holding on tight fasten

352
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,959
the seat belts is what I'm saying if

353
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,600
you've already done that because already

354
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,199
you should have the seat belt fastened

355
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,639
for just what we're talking about just

356
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,720
what we've been talking

357
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,639
about we should already have them

358
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,920
fastened all right so talk a little bit

359
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,040
about the

360
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,680
history of hashimotos the swollen

361
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,880
thyroid now

362
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,079
originally in the 17 1800s late 1700s

363
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,480
early 1800s originally right around that

364
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,560
time there was there was a goer

365
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,240
developing this was from iodine

366
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,480
deficiencies in certain areas of the

367
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,160
world goers and that was from a real

368
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,199
true 100% you know iodine

369
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,199
deficiency that was different than the

370
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,519
thyroiditis always different than the

371
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,959
thyroiditis that was creeping up come

372
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,240
around the turn of the

373
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,160
century right around the late 1800s all

374
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,000
these food experiments were happening

375
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,720
that not even people know when they know

376
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,839
about the Green Revolution and they know

377
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,120
about all that kind of stuff that was

378
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,360
going on in 1950s and how food was being

379
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,480
you know um monog grown and sprays were

380
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,800
being you know uh the whole thing with

381
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,360
pesticides and everything there were a

382
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,839
lot of different experiments pre

383
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:16,399
1900 all in the late you know in the

384
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:18,600
1860s 1870s 1880s tremendous experience

385
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,839
experiments I mean lots of them

386
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:25,720
tremendous amounts of them I mean due to

387
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,800
food they were dropping off canisters at

388
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,079
every Farm whether it's small Mom and

389
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,920
Pop to a little bit bigger to

390
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,759
everybody's backyard to farmers markets

391
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,120
dropping off cans of contaminated

392
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:41,600
materials to BL and put

393
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,279
on everybody's food that was growing in

394
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,880
that time 1860 1870 this is

395
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,079
completely hidden hidden in the in the

396
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,279
world because people can't handle this

397
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,680
they just don't want to they didn't want

398
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,720
to know then they don't want to know

399
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,480
now these were experimental insecticides

400
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
the

401
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,240
earliest these were experimental

402
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,560
antibiotics before the birth of

403
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,839
antibiotics before the birth of

404
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,199
penicillin in the

405
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,760
1900s and it was experimented on our

406
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:14,559
food really broke our immune systems

407
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,600
down like never before in

408
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,760
history it also fed a harmless bug a

409
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,480
friendly little bug that was never

410
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:28,039
against us ever which was Epstein

411
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,919
bar Epstein bar it was a virus that

412
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:34,000
actually only worked in our favor it

413
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,080
destroyed enemies and it helped us it

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,360
was a friend not a

415
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:44,120
foe it was a friend a friend friend to

416
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:48,679
our immune system it protected us from

417
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:51,720
disease it was a bug actually it had not

418
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,320
a mean streak in it on any level but it

419
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,880
was tampered with and it was fed poison

420
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,000
and it was beaten

421
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:03,159
down and by 1900

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,679
it was getting into some thyroids was

423
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,919
creating the first

424
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,600
thyroiditis the first thyroiditis that

425
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,880
wasn't just an iodine

426
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,360
deficiency it wasn't just a

427
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,280
goer and it got into the thyroid isn't

428
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,440
this fun isn't this fun though I'm still

429
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,760
have I'm having too much fun I'm sorry

430
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm sorry I'm having too much fun I just

431
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,960
I waited for this this book to come out

432
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
I just waited we waited we waited okay

433
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,919
all right

434
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,600
so the virus became a little bit more

435
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:39,600
meaner developed a little bit

436
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,640
more of a meanor streak it wasn't in

437
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,520
everybody it wasn't spread it wasn't

438
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,880
spread to everybody it wasn't getting

439
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,400
too far there weren't a lot of

440
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,400
cases of this thyroiditis it was

441
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,400
rare But as time went on in the

442
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,400
1900s the virus changed and it mutated

443
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,039
ated and a few more strains developed

444
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,240
and by 1940 women discovered they had

445
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:10,320
symptoms for the first time in women's

446
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,280
history of the symptoms they had which

447
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,960
seemed like very which seemed very odd

448
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
and strange medical community was

449
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,039
completely baffled 100% had no idea what

450
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,799
the hell was going on there were

451
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,799
neurological symptoms there were the hot

452
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,520
flashes hot flashes in the first time

453
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,240
first time ever real recorded documented

454
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,360
hot

455
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,000
flashes up and down temperature

456
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,679
fluctuations

457
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,520
fevers aches and pains

458
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,919
fatigue hair falling out hair falling

459
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,840
out hair didn't fall out before then

460
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,600
hair didn't fall out before

461
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,720
then there were you know hair loss the

462
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,280
brittle nails all the different

463
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,520
symptoms and medical science was

464
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,440
completely

465
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,159
baffled and what was happening was the

466
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,080
epin bar virus was growing into

467
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,120
something different growing into

468
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,760
something

469
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,440
different and more cases of thyroiditis

470
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,039
were developing more thyroid problems

471
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,039
for women more cases of thyroiditis were

472
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,120
uh was

473
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,200
developing

474
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,200
and Medical Research Medical Science

475
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,320
didn't know what to do besides they were

476
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,880
already in the process in the late 40s

477
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,520
and mid mid to late 40s they were

478
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,159
already in the process of developing and

479
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,679
working on hormones they're working on

480
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,480
hormones they were in the process this

481
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:33,400
was the perfect perfect match ever

482
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,679
before in history the perfect match by

483
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,200
1950s so many women were literally

484
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,559
lining the doctor's

485
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,200
offices the ones that were

486
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,039
wealthy they were told they had a they

487
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,360
they they had a problem the ones that

488
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,480
weren't wealthy were told they were

489
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,240
insane that's how medicine worked back

490
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,919
then by the way that's how conventional

491
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,120
medicine worked this is an alternative

492
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,480
medicine alternative medicine was a

493
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,360
beautiful thing back then no doubt

494
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,840
conventional medicine was an absolutely

495
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,520
hot mess a complete disaster at this

496
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,760
point so when very wealthy rich women

497
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,559
came into the doctor's office the

498
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,640
doctors are like well you know you do

499
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,520
have something going on and now since

500
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,279
big Pharma gave us all these hormones

501
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,360
here let's let's make sure we apply

502
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,919
these because we think you have just

503
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,679
hormone problems and they were really

504
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,520
steroidal these hormones that they were

505
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,240
giving these women which led to some

506
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,679
suppression of some of the symptoms but

507
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,679
not a lot of suppression at all in fact

508
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,200
even worse symptoms in many to most

509
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,440
women at that point but it was

510
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,480
completely birthed the hormone movement

511
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,440
at that point of it's your hormones it's

512
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,799
your hormones women that were poor that

513
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,919
went to the doctor that got to the

514
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:44,080
doctor and they were on the lower class

515
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
scale at that time frame in history they

516
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,720
were told they were

517
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:54,880
nuts just hysterical crazy lying

518
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:57,720
bored so and um and maybe hormonal too

519
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,480
depending on who the doctor was so this

520
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,880
is what was going on in this time frame

521
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,880
medicine was was

522
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,960
disgusting and you know and so but what

523
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:14,640
was really happening was Epstein bar all

524
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:19,600
the women that were born in 1900 1905

525
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,600
1904 1894 1898

526
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
1897

527
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:30,039
1910 by the 40s and 50s 1940s and 1950s

528
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,720
they were 40 years old 45 years old 50

529
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,039
years old so it seemed like it matched

530
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,240
the change of the of of

531
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,200
menopause so that's why the hormonal

532
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,720
thing just really kicked in as being the

533
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,120
the the the tell all for what these

534
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,840
symptoms were but before that women in

535
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,400
their 40s didn't experience that women

536
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,480
in their 50s didn't experience that

537
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,760
before that this is a firsttime thing in

538
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,960
history the change was never a painful

539
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:02,200
toxic kind of

540
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,440
thing meaning both emotionally mentally

541
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,679
historically but it was the Epstein bar

542
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,520
creating a whole new barrage of

543
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,240
symptoms and thyroid problems were more

544
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,120
common too more common which leads to

545
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,520
where we are today where the experts

546
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
today are like well the thyroid is

547
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,799
causing most of all this now yes and

548
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,000
you're going through a change and the

549
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,799
thyroid is causing most of these

550
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,080
problems now because it's all kind of

551
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,039
seeming like the same time frame but not

552
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,480
really because women now in their 20s

553
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,679
have thyroid problems 30s have in their

554
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,679
20s and early 30s teens have thyroid

555
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,720
problems so that's also kind of a

556
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,039
baffling aspect of it all but they're

557
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,000
just it's all just thrown into hey it's

558
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
autoimmune in the bodies attacking these

559
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,480
young women

560
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,039
early on the basis of that false Theory

561
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,039
to begin

562
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,480
with so right now today we're in a place

563
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,120
where Hashim Oto we think we have the

564
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,679
answers when we don't we do now what's

565
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,000
in your hand it's

566
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,720
there but we're still in Antiquity land

567
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,039
until we drop a the body's attacking

568
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,559
itself and going after the thyroid and

569
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,159
these Auto antibodies are there to

570
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,559
destroy the thyroid and if we can get

571
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,760
out of that land then we're out of

572
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,080
antiquity

573
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,760
land but we're not going to get out of

574
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,000
there because that married law is still

575
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,880
in is still going to impregnate and

576
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,279
still going to saturate every single

577
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,480
expert from here on out that's coming

578
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:38,080
out except you as an expert you it

579
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,720
won't you're getting the

580
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,440
truth you know when it says the truth in

581
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,960
the subtitle of the

582
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,399
book when it's anything medical medium

583
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,200
then it's the darn

584
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,159
truth you need to know the difference

585
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,320
between that and the truth you see and a

586
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,240
lot of other self- health books you need

587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,720
to know the difference this is the

588
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,760
difference you're hearing it now you're

589
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,720
going to read it it's important to

590
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,240
understand this isn't me boasting this

591
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,640
is about taking Health seriously and

592
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,200
really getting better this is about

593
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,080
really making a difference with the

594
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,600
people around you you yourself if it's

595
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,520
just you yourself then that's that's

596
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,960
that's all I need if it's people around

597
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,559
you great that's wonderful it's people

598
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,039
around them wonderful if it's getting

599
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,440
the message out wonderful whatever it

600
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,679
is whatever it

601
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,360
is

602
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,240
Hashimoto is a stage of Epstein bar

603
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,240
after Epstein bar leaves the liver

604
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,679
Epstein bar leaves the liver and it

605
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,080
heads to the

606
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,120
thyroid and Hashimoto thyroiditis is a

607
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,279
stage hypothyroidism is a stage it's

608
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,000
just the same thing it's the virus

609
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,720
leaving the liver going into the thyroid

610
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,720
that's the Epstein

611
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:59,080
bar and the Hashimoto is a little bit

612
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,679
more heavy dut Beauty version where it's

613
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,320
not just keeping at a hypothyroid but

614
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,640
it's all the same a lot of people with

615
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,200
hypothyroid end up hashimotos later

616
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,159
because the thyroid was in the the the

617
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,520
thyroid was in the stage of the Epstein

618
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:15,679
bar sitting in there working on the

619
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,720
thyroid so over time it then

620
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,960
became seeable as far as antibodies

621
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,480
being pre present in the blood

622
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,840
work but that's also a lot of times you

623
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,279
can have Auto antibodies and it's not

624
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,799
even present in the blood works so you

625
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,320
can even have that with hypothyroid

626
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,640
doctor won't even know cuz blood tests

627
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,080
aren't aren't so easy to read which

628
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,279
you'll see there's a guest tests guest

629
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,760
test chapter in this in this book

630
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,799
thyroid guest tests talking about how

631
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,080
why and what why it's so difficult and

632
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:44,880
why a lot of doctors now and

633
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,760
practitioners are guessing and just

634
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,200
saying well you need to go on thyroid

635
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,120
medication you need to be on thyroid

636
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,080
medication even though your numbers look

637
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,600
good or they look borderline you'll see

638
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:00,000
why when you read that

639
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,039
chapter and so what is going on with the

640
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,520
auto

641
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,399
antibody well as you'll also read the

642
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,320
auto antibody is designed by your immune

643
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:10,960
system to go after only one thing a

644
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,720
virus it has tagged a virus it has

645
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,080
tagged a virus it has

646
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,679
found it's not going after thyroid

647
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,960
tissue the virus goes after thyroid

648
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,720
tissue the virus inflames the virus

649
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,559
itself inflames and this is not known

650
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,039
till this day it is not known yet in any

651
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:32,240
in any

652
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,600
place in any place where we got the

653
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,720
research of Science and we got the

654
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,120
experts it's just not known

655
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,000
yet will they ever learn down the road

656
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,399
it depends because breaking the

657
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,399
autoimmune Theory means admitting you

658
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:49,760
don't science of research doesn't know

659
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,399
what's wrong with their patients yet it

660
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,080
admits that and that it's not the

661
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,600
patient's fault and it's not your body

662
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,799
attacking itself and that's not going to

663
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,720
be something easily admitt ever by the

664
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:04,399
medical research department or in even

665
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,760
experts that put out books because it it

666
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,720
it it it it outdates their book

667
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,120
instantly in the thyroid

668
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,600
Market think about it that's serious you

669
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,279
put out a book you got something you

670
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,480
believe in but you can't drop a theory

671
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:22,440
to get people better to move forward

672
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,840
because it it it cancels out what you

673
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,080
did in your work so how is it ever going

674
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,240
to change think about that right I mean

675
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:31,200
that's difficult and I don't blame a

676
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,159
practitioner or a Healer or a doctor

677
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,480
that's written a book that has outdated

678
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:38,200
thyroid information I don't blame them

679
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,919
at all it's like it's like your work is

680
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:45,760
all there and then you're like holy crap

681
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,039
I can't let those theories down because

682
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,679
it means it it outdates my book the work

683
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,240
I put into and that's why it's that hard

684
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,679
to get people

685
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,200
better that alone is that what that's

686
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,440
that's that's why it's that hard to get

687
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,440
people

688
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,200
better so the auto

689
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,960
antibody the auto

690
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,320
antibody goes after the virus itself and

691
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,960
only the virus the body is brilliant

692
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,279
your body is brilliant your body is such

693
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:19,080
a healing machine oh my

694
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:21,080
God lord it's a healing

695
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,240
machine like no

696
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,480
other your immune system is like no

697
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,799
other it sends out soldiers it creates

698
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,840
soldiers called Auto

699
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:35,640
antibodies not Auto as in destructing

700
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,039
you and hurting you or whatever no no no

701
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,880
no is going specifically after the virus

702
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,120
and even if research and science

703
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,799
discovered this they probably

704
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,039
wouldn't put it out

705
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:49,600
there because it means they have to open

706
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:51,000
up such a huge can of worms about

707
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,799
Epstein bar and they have to give

708
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,279
Anthony upstein and Dr bar

709
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,039
credit and then they have to find billi

710
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,880
ions of dollars and do research on

711
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
Epstein bar they so don't want to go

712
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,080
there because it takes billions away

713
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,480
from investing into genes and genetics

714
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,919
which puts the blame on you once again

715
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,600
so how are we ever going to get that

716
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,600
truth out there well we're going to get

717
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,880
it out there you guys us we're going to

718
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,399
get it out

719
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,880
there takes a little time got to have

720
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,720
patience but that auto antibody goes

721
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,559
exactly after the virus and only after

722
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,320
the virus it's there to break down that

723
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,320
virus go after

724
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:37,760
it and even when it's not detectable

725
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,720
on on a blood test or through blood

726
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,440
blood profile even if it's not even you

727
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,840
can find it even if you can't even find

728
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,080
it your body's still going after that

729
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,600
virus even when you're in just hypo

730
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,600
instead of just

731
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,559
Hashi it's going after the virus it's

732
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,840
designed to go after the virus it's

733
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,480
actually programmed to go after the

734
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,760
virus it's it's

735
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,200
tagged to go after the virus it's

736
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,440
looking to only tag the virus

737
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,000
itself the virus is what causes the

738
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,600
inflammation inside the thyroid the

739
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,519
virus is what causes cigar tissue the

740
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,559
virus is what causes uh thyroid nodules

741
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,440
the virus is which what causes any kind

742
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:24,480
of cyst or any kind of tumor inside a

743
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,720
thyroid all from the Epstein bar there's

744
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,159
different varieties you'll read about

745
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,159
those two

746
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:36,039
and is this information

747
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,159
helpful it's beyond

748
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,960
helpful because when you know your body

749
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,960
is doing the right thing and you know

750
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:47,360
it's going after something the right way

751
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,360
you can heal fast and

752
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:52,519
faster knowledge is power when it comes

753
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,880
down to this it comes down to this

754
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,880
knowledge is incredibly powerful I can't

755
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:03,240
even say it enough incredibly

756
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,240
powerful I can't even say it

757
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:11,120
enough so let's talk

758
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,679
about symptoms a little bit H

759
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,279
hypothyroid symptoms what you're

760
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,600
experiencing when you're experiencing

761
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,880
hashimotos or

762
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,360
hypothyroid those symptoms aren't the

763
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,240
thyroid causing it and you're going to

764
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,159
learn that there's very few symptoms the

765
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,960
thyroid actually causes from bonking out

766
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:30,240
on us from getting affected by Epstein

767
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,919
bar in anyway very few symptoms some

768
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,399
temperature fluctuations is pretty much

769
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,519
it I think maybe a couple more I put in

770
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:41,639
there but that's

771
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:43,559
it well there's a lot of people I I know

772
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:45,480
somebody's mind is blown there's a lot

773
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,799
of people and I'm going to explain this

774
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,240
that's why there's a lot of people they

775
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,799
get their hormones balanced just right

776
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,240
for the

777
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,440
thyroid they get rid of even I mean

778
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,000
their Auto antibodies don't even show

779
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,320
but they're still dealing with lots of

780
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,480
symptoms they always have they're still

781
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,679
dealing with the fatigue or they're

782
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,679
still dealing with something else or

783
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,320
they're still dealing with some

784
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,480
different symptom they're still dealing

785
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,600
with weight gain whatever it

786
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,240
is because it's not coming from the

787
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,000
thyroid and I explain in symptoms and

788
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,240
conditions list you'll see where a lot

789
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,639
of these symptoms are coming

790
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,679
from I can't believe I can even say that

791
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:23,679
that means you got the

792
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,880
book

793
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,399
and that that's that's amazing so

794
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,080
understand that Hashimoto and

795
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,360
hypothyroidism the symptoms are not

796
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,360
thyroid

797
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,799
related but they're liver related other

798
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,480
things related they're viral related

799
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:52,120
they're about being

800
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,919
viral I've had people without a

801
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,240
thyroid have all the same symptoms

802
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,880
nothing went away nothing changed

803
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,440
or they had their thyroid killed off all

804
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,080
the same symptoms they had their the

805
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,480
hormones up to par the hormones were up

806
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,480
the

807
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,359
level all the same symptoms same thing

808
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,639
with somebody with hypothyroid all the

809
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,159
same

810
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,720
symptoms sometimes a thyroid medication

811
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:17,159
can suppress and I talk about that in

812
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,040
here it's a steroid so it can suppress

813
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,560
some symptoms and they put a lot of of

814
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,000
thyroid medication in you the reason why

815
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,679
is cuz you're they want to keep those

816
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,399
numbers up because the liver keeps on

817
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,760
sucking up that medication sucking up

818
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,919
that medication sucking up that

819
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,399
medication and keeps on absorbing it

820
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,960
finally the liver maxes out and it's

821
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,679
like I can't absorb anymore and then

822
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
finally you get balanced meaning they're

823
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,399
like okay you don't have to really

824
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,359
change your your your thyroid medication

825
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,839
amount because it seems to be level in

826
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,280
the bloodstream that's cu the liver had

827
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,280
to fill

828
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:50,480
up and with all that steroid compound

829
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,599
floating around it can sometimes

830
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,159
suppress symptoms viral symptoms and

831
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,359
sometimes it doesn't you'll read about a

832
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,320
little bit of that to

833
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:03,119
too

834
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,200
so what happens is just like it happened

835
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,640
starting in 1940s and 1950s all these

836
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,720
symptoms

837
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,400
occurred and the blame was on hormones

838
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,079
only like the change the menopause men

839
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,680
had had these symptoms they didn't

840
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,960
complain it was a stoic time back then

841
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,040
and Men weren't allowed to complain they

842
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,800
were scared to death to tell their

843
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,000
doctor they had a

844
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,520
symptom they were also scared to death

845
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,320
of telling their workplace because they

846
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,160
would be

847
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,359
fired let go seen as unusable or not

848
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,079
usable or not or useless symptoms were

849
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:43,800
not a good

850
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,240
thing if a man had hot flashes it was

851
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,880
totally

852
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:54,240
just canceled out as work

853
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,200
sweat and just shaken

854
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,400
off a man a man had to be stoic back

855
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,040
then in the greatest

856
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,079
sense and couldn't have a

857
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,720
complaint were allowed to complain now

858
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,040
you know men are allowed to complain all

859
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,240
day long they're allowed to feel their

860
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,440
emotions

861
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,280
and contemplate and wonder who they are

862
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,880
and whatever they're allowed to do that

863
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
they weren't allowed to do that then it

864
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,240
was seemed it was it was

865
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,760
odd it was

866
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,839
odd he had to roam with the pack survive

867
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,480
in the

868
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:36,560
world no time for complaining about any

869
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,960
kind of symptom thank God women were

870
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,920
bold strong and said I don't care what

871
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,640
it takes I need to get my message out I

872
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,560
don't care who what where knows it

873
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,760
doesn't know it I need to go to the

874
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,400
doctor I need to let the doctor know

875
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,880
there's something going on here and

876
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,880
thank God for that because it has helped

877
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,760
it has

878
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,720
helped but the the hormone time period

879
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,119
was birthed at at that point and then

880
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,400
eventually it just fell into thyroid

881
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,720
later on after that and then of course

882
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,680
down to thyroid and the hormone period

883
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,040
it's just thyroid and the hormone period

884
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,680
time now where we're just it's it's PR

885
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,359
per menopause and thyroid but what is

886
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,720
not understood with all the per

887
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,560
menopause symptoms and menopause

888
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,280
symptoms and postmenopause symptoms is

889
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,839
those are all epin bar symptoms those

890
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,400
are all viral symptoms and yes there's a

891
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,800
thyroid problem that has occurred

892
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,400
because that's a stage of when the virus

893
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,720
gets from the liver to the

894
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,520
thyroid the thyroid is just another

895
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,440
victim in the batch of symptoms that's

896
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,920
occurring the thyroid is just another

897
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,839
symptom that is the big big big thing

898
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,240
right there that's

899
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:49,240
it that's the big boy right

900
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:56,040
there and

901
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,480
that that's ignored meaning research and

902
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,800
science don't want you knowing that even

903
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,839
if they

904
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:07,240
knew they

905
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,240
don't it's just one other

906
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,760
thing it's just one other thing

907
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:17,240
happening it's one other symptom it's

908
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,280
one other part of of all of that but

909
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,960
it's not the cause it's not the cause of

910
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,720
the aches and pains the fatigue the

911
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,359
brain fog the confusion the

912
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,280
lightheadedness the vertigo the tentis

913
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:31,800
the the uh hot flashes the mood swings

914
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,560
the brittle nails the hair falling

915
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,040
out it's not a part of that it's

916
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,400
not and that's a big thing that's a big

917
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,000
thing that's why I'm even pausing

918
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,480
because it's just it it's it's

919
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,160
unbelievable what's going on in in in

920
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,680
the medical world right now and what's

921
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,160
happening and how it's things are seen

922
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,400
and understood we're still behind

923
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,400
chronic illness is still behind

924
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,079
look I totally love research and science

925
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,720
love it love it love it it just it's

926
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,640
just not there with thyroid disease and

927
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,000
thyroid illness and everything about the

928
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,000
thyroid it's not there

929
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,280
yet

930
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,240
hyperthyroid hyperthyroid is the epin

931
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,720
bar going into the

932
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,720
thyroid and accelerating tissue

933
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,079
growth because it's attacking the

934
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,800
thyroid so feverishly that the thyroid

935
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,359
protects itself and develops a little

936
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,520
bit more tissue this is a protection

937
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,520
meth mechanism for

938
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:41,280
you the bulging eyes for Graves and

939
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,079
hyperthyroid that comes from fluid

940
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,680
buildup from having the virus fluid

941
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,319
build up specifically behind the

942
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,160
eyes it's not the thyroid necessarily

943
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,880
causing bulging eyes the thyroid problem

944
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,359
itself is not causing the bulging eyes

945
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,680
this is fluid buildup behind the eyes

946
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,280
this is something research science

947
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,160
doesn't know either yet understands that

948
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,160
symptom yet

949
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,400
entirely

950
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,280
somebody can still gain weight with

951
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,000
hyperthyroid because they'll also have

952
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,440
another variety of Epstein bar which is

953
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,440
the one that slows down the

954
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,040
thyroid meaning that's the one that sits

955
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:25,359
in the liver allowing the liver to get

956
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,359
super super sluggish causing the weight

957
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,359
gain

958
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,880
so what happens is if the liver has a

959
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,680
lot of viral material in it so it has

960
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,119
two varieties of viruses or even three

961
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,760
some people have even more they have

962
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,920
different kinds of viruses but if they

963
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,319
have two varieties of the Epstein

964
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,880
bar the liver really gets sluggish and

965
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,640
slows down so even if someone has the

966
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,480
hyperthyroid virus and it's in the

967
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,920
thyroid creating a little accelerating

968
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,079
the tissue growth a little bit which is

969
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,319
more hormone

970
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,319
production they also can have the other

971
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,800
Epstein bar inside the liver that's also

972
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,960
inside the thyroid but it's inside the

973
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,319
liver really really really slowing the

974
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,000
liver

975
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:10,160
down which then affects the

976
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
thyroid but it's the liver being the

977
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,800
problem it's the liver being the symptom

978
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,400
that's the problem the liver is where

979
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,280
that's at it's not the thyroid in the

980
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,640
end but it's the liver that's actually

981
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,000
causing that and that's a whole another

982
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,400
thing the liver is causing

983
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,040
literally dozens and dozens of symptoms

984
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,280
because Epstein bar sitting inside the

985
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,640
liver causing symptoms and causing

986
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,440
problems for the thyroid and for other

987
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,079
things in the body cuz the thyroid like

988
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,160
I said is just this other victim it's

989
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:43,920
just this other thing that's happening

990
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,920
it's another part of what's being

991
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,520
problematic and when somebody gets a

992
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,880
thyroid killed off there's still thyroid

993
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,839
tissue working and there's still thyroid

994
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,119
working and when someone gets their

995
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,000
thyroid removed you'll and you'll read

996
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,079
about that how that works someone gets

997
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,200
their thyroid

998
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,560
removed there's still thyroid tissue

999
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,800
always left producing

1000
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,359
hormone but what

1001
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,200
hormone is the most important hormone

1002
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:16,839
you're thinking T4

1003
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,240
T3 no they're the least important

1004
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:22,400
hormones there's two undiscovered

1005
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:25,520
hormones that you're going to read

1006
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,480
about that are really important to

1007
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,040
thyroid

1008
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,839
healing

1009
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,800
now um so let's go into a couple of

1010
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,720
other things here let's go into a couple

1011
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,280
other things that we need to go

1012
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,440
into we're going to talk about the role

1013
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,400
of the thyroid a little bit this is fun

1014
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
this is fun we're going to talk about

1015
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:50,680
the role of the

1016
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,119
thyroid now the thyroid its function is

1017
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,319
a lot different than we think we think

1018
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,920
it's the metabolism function we think

1019
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:01,200
it's just for controlling weight it's

1020
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,160
it's we think we we don't science

1021
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,000
research believes that the thyroid does

1022
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,880
a whole bunch of the T4 D T3 means

1023
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,480
everything meaning it basically sustains

1024
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,480
our

1025
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,000
life and it's these the ultimate

1026
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,800
metabolism hormones too keeping weight

1027
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
off and everything like that and by the

1028
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,960
way that's just not true there are so

1029
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,520
many women that have either normal

1030
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,240
numbers or they have or they have um

1031
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,760
hormone replacement they have the

1032
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,200
thyroid medications and they're still

1033
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,200
gaining weight like crazy because like I

1034
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,720
said before it's the liver and it's the

1035
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,359
virus inside the liver that does that

1036
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,400
just like when someone has two viruses

1037
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,760
like I said with hyperthyroid that's why

1038
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,680
hyperthyroid people they they tend to

1039
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,200
gain weight too and just so you know

1040
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,319
people with

1041
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,559
hyperthyroid there's more people with

1042
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:51,640
hyperthyroid gaining weight meaning

1043
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,880
overweight hyper thyroids than there are

1044
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,640
people underweight

1045
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,559
hyperthyroid very important to know very

1046
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,040
important to

1047
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:04,160
know that that's a critical critical

1048
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,160
point to know by the way but boy they'll

1049
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,720
make it out like different they'll

1050
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,480
completely make it out different to try

1051
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,559
to prove a point that they have a theory

1052
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,960
that they have so they'll make it seem

1053
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:15,960
like no no no then you're you're the

1054
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,920
only one that's gaining weight with

1055
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,400
hyperthyroid that's how they'll act and

1056
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,920
be it's unbelievable research of science

1057
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,480
will they'll just you're the only one

1058
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,640
everybody else they're all losing weight

1059
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,680
they can't keep their weight on with

1060
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,160
hyper thyroid and you're the only one

1061
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,440
gaining weight with hyperthyroid you're

1062
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,960
just an anomaly oh okay just here's your

1063
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:37,839
medication see you off on your

1064
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,200
way no no no no there's more people much

1065
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,760
more it's like 70% of people with

1066
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,480
hyperthyroid are gaining weight and

1067
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,440
they're overweight and they're dealing

1068
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,720
with weight issues 30% are either normal

1069
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:53,280
with their weight or losing

1070
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:55,079
weight and that's even that's even not

1071
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,760
even right meaning in the sense that

1072
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:02,200
that 30%

1073
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,720
um 30% is complicated it's complicated

1074
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,079
it means people still stay the same

1075
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,240
weight most of that 30% and then they

1076
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,880
gain weight later is what I mean they

1077
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,079
gain weight later so it all depends on

1078
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,440
where the person is in their time

1079
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,720
someone could have hyperthyroid when

1080
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,400
they're 30 and have their weight stable

1081
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,440
or even lose a little but for some

1082
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,200
reason here they are later on gaining

1083
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,160
weight and and before any kind of iodine

1084
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,160
treatment radioactive iodine or any kind

1085
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,160
of kill off or anything else like that

1086
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,480
or any removal of thyroid or anything

1087
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,480
like that and then they're gaining

1088
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,800
weight before any of that even happens

1089
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,480
that's another thing none of this is

1090
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,599
they don't document all this all the

1091
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,880
different variables and what

1092
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:46,440
happens so in essence most hyperthyroid

1093
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
people don't have a weight loss problem

1094
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,599
they have a weight gaining problem one

1095
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,599
time or another

1096
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,280
eventually

1097
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,520
because the amount of thyroid having the

1098
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,480
other thyroid virus I was talking about

1099
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,040
the other Epstein bar not the one that

1100
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,280
accelerates uh hormones and tissue

1101
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,960
growth in the thyroid that you'll read

1102
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,119
about with hyperthyroid but the other

1103
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,559
one that slows down the liver which

1104
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:12,160
slows down everything the other one

1105
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,280
sitting in the thyroid and that slows

1106
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,800
down the

1107
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,839
liver

1108
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:23,040
so um so let's go into what the thyroid

1109
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,599
does what does it really

1110
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,400
do what does a thyroid really do I mean

1111
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,880
that that's another thing too well first

1112
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,240
of all it's like the second

1113
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,920
brain it's your body's data

1114
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:41,079
center it's not the metabolism

1115
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:44,720
manager that everybody wants it to

1116
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:48,040
be it cataloges everything it's it marks

1117
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,040
everything it cataloges

1118
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,119
everything its goal is to create

1119
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,520
homeostasis throughout the body but

1120
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,599
homeostasis throughout the body balance

1121
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,359
throughout the body it's the complaint

1122
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,200
center and you'll even read about that

1123
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,040
the this is really funny the complaint

1124
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,359
center that's where every organ every

1125
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,559
gland in the whole body can send out a

1126
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,760
complaint to the

1127
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:13,559
thyroid but what's it sending out a

1128
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:16,920
complaint for so that T4 and T3 can do

1129
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:20,079
anything no no no no it's not sending

1130
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,319
out a complaint so that T4 and T3 can

1131
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,480
save the world within the body that's

1132
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,240
what I'm trying to

1133
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,680
say it's not doing that these other two

1134
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,119
hormones that are undiscovered by

1135
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,119
research and

1136
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,119
science

1137
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,440
okay these other two hormones that

1138
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,040
you're going to read

1139
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:44,480
about they are radio frequency

1140
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,559
hormones because research and science

1141
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,800
only looks for one kind of

1142
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,079
hormone a special chemical that

1143
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,640
determines if it's a hormone or not

1144
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:56,599
meaning a a different kind of there's

1145
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,040
different kinds of hormones

1146
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:02,880
some that aren't just the the blatant

1147
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,800
steroid variety what I'm saying is the

1148
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,480
only

1149
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:10,040
hormone the only hormone variety

1150
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,680
research and science has documented so

1151
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,559
they know what they're looking for is a

1152
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,640
steroidal based hormone that means we

1153
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,920
have all these different hormones in the

1154
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,520
body all these different hormones but

1155
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,480
they all have a steroid touch to it they

1156
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,319
all have an identification of steroid

1157
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,040
but there's this whole group of hormones

1158
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:30,280
in the body in general in all kinds of

1159
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,200
places that I'm going to have to get

1160
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,079
information from Spirit along the way my

1161
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,359
source and get it to you but there's a

1162
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,160
whole bunch of different kinds of

1163
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,720
hormones that aren't steroid

1164
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:45,000
based so they're not identified in the

1165
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,319
lab because the lab is only literally

1166
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,040
programmed with data to find a

1167
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:50,040
steroid-based

1168
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,680
hormone these hormones are radio

1169
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:57,119
frequency hormones cu the body is way

1170
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,520
more complicated than anybody knows than

1171
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,640
research and science has ever discovered

1172
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,640
radio frequency

1173
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:08,520
hormones they're not a steroid compound

1174
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,079
attached to

1175
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,359
it there's there's no chemical compounds

1176
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,599
in the steroid Department that are

1177
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:17,760
really Affiliated or understood with the

1178
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,200
radio frequency

1179
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,359
hormone and the radio frequency hormone

1180
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,559
has chemical compounds but they're not

1181
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,240
going to be understood as the regular

1182
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,720
steroid the regular steroid that

1183
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:31,200
everybody knows about which is

1184
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,040
everything T4 T3 which is progesterone

1185
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,240
and and estrogen which is testosterone

1186
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,960
which is all the different hormones

1187
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,880
which is you know all of that the sex

1188
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,599
hormones all of that they are steroids

1189
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,359
the adrenaline hormon

1190
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,400
steroids

1191
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:48,440
steroids well that's what they are so

1192
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,440
they're identified like that in the labs

1193
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,200
but radio frequency hormones are not

1194
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:56,040
discovered

1195
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:59,160
yet and the thyroid has two of them that

1196
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,000
play a bigger role in our thyroid health

1197
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,680
and our body's physical health than than

1198
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,680
no one even can imagine

1199
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,760
yet and so these frequencies get

1200
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,520
delivered to different parts of the body

1201
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,119
to keep it balanced delivered to the

1202
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,839
liver delivered to the pancreas

1203
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:19,839
delivered to other glands and

1204
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:22,839
organs and that's the powerful real

1205
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,720
role of the

1206
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:30,000
thyroid so if the thyroid gets d

1207
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,400
damaged if the thyroid gets

1208
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,599
hurt if the thyroid gets injured by

1209
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,960
Epstein

1210
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,559
bar the thyroid is still going to send

1211
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,839
out those radio

1212
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,280
frequencies cuz radio frequencies are

1213
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,400
powerful in the thyroid to the point

1214
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,640
where you only need a little bit of

1215
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,240
thyroid tissue left you're still going

1216
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,720
to have a lot of radio frequency coming

1217
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,359
out of those little pockets of tissue

1218
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,880
even if your thyroid scarred and damaged

1219
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,880
and everything

1220
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,480
else

1221
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,240
and the liver stores a tremendous amount

1222
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,160
of interesting chemical compounds that

1223
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,720
help out the thyroid when a thyroid

1224
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,960
calls out for radio with the radio

1225
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:12,040
frequencies and the adrenals

1226
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,559
overcompensate as well the adren

1227
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:18,559
adrenals can even mimic T4

1228
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,920
T3 in its own way can do all kinds of

1229
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,839
things for us to give us to give us

1230
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,920
backup hormones the thyroid works with

1231
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:30,520
every organ and every gland and this is

1232
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:34,160
a big deal and this right here we're not

1233
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,880
there yet as far as research and science

1234
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,200
T4 T3 play a role in our health but a

1235
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:42,160
small one T4 T3 really just helped the

1236
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,480
immune system stay balanced which is

1237
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,160
important don't get me wrong it is

1238
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,559
important but other things keep the

1239
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,319
immune system balanced too other thing

1240
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,319
other things in the body keep it

1241
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:59,720
balanced and so

1242
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:04,000
T T4 T3 help with temperature

1243
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:07,040
controls so you don't feel cold in the

1244
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,200
morning or you don't feel kind of like

1245
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,200
there's a little bit temperature

1246
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:18,680
off but that's pretty much

1247
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:21,240
it your thyroid sends a 911 call out to

1248
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:25,119
the liver for backup for storage of T4

1249
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,880
and T3 if your thyroid needs it it sends

1250
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,160
an 911 call through a radio frequency

1251
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,839
hormone the Undiscovered radio frequency

1252
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,480
hormones to the liver to

1253
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:39,680
get the liver to convert some T4 to T3

1254
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,359
and also to get some T3 to begin with

1255
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,880
and T4 going out of the liver if

1256
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,440
needed that's the power of the thyroid

1257
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,079
that's one of its

1258
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:54,440
roles and it can do that even if it's

1259
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:56,960
injured even if epine bar has invaded

1260
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,799
the thyroid

1261
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,359
the adrenals can create T4 and

1262
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:06,880
T3 and even a little bit of radio

1263
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,760
frequency R5 and R

1264
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,359
six has

1265
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,119
backup so this is important

1266
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:17,000
information okay let's take a sip I'm I

1267
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:21,160
am I I don't know you guys but I'm going

1268
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,160
to take a sip here of some tea bear with

1269
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:29,680
me that's a mix of peppermint and lemon

1270
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:33,720
Bal it's very good very

1271
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,839
good okay so um let's go into symptoms

1272
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:38,280
let's talk about symptoms a little bit

1273
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:43,200
let's do that that that's kind of

1274
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:46,319
fun um weight gain liver the liver

1275
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:47,920
causes weight gain um the liver becomes

1276
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,119
toxic over the

1277
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,880
years um uh builds up little fatty

1278
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,640
deposits even if it's not diagnosed as a

1279
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:59,280
fatty liver yet and and that's the very

1280
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:04,640
basis behind weight

1281
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:07,520
gain mostly the basis basis behind

1282
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:09,599
it metabolism

1283
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,119
metabolism that's really just the liver

1284
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,920
once again um make sure you read the

1285
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:16,000
metabolism

1286
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,119
chapter whatever you

1287
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,760
do you can't forget about the metabolism

1288
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:26,440
chapter so make sure you you look into

1289
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:29,400
that one um hair loss

1290
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,960
hair loss that's adrenals that's that's

1291
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,640
that's cortisol that's adrenals that's

1292
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,400
adrenals being in you can be under

1293
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,599
stress for three four years five years

1294
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,880
in your life you could be drinking

1295
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,160
coffee being stressed out um not taking

1296
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,160
care of yourself getting really

1297
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,520
deficient but the adrenals play the

1298
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,040
largest role in hair loss hair thinning

1299
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,599
not the thyroid the adrenals

1300
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,319
do and you can read more about it you

1301
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,400
know more kind of cleaner version in the

1302
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:57,720
book I'm glazing over it right right now

1303
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,839
meaning that symptoms hair texture

1304
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,760
that's straight

1305
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:02,280
deficiencies that's one of the things

1306
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,960
straight

1307
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:07,440
deficiencies

1308
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,480
insomnia insomnia is a neurotransmitter

1309
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,640
problem usually Epstein bar and Epstein

1310
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,520
bar creates deficiencies just eats away

1311
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,079
at at our um vitamin storage

1312
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:20,160
bin slows down the liver um all that

1313
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,920
stuff so we we get less vitamins less

1314
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,640
conversion with vitamins less

1315
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,640
methylation that's all that's that all H

1316
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,640
happens with um Epstein bar inside the

1317
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,720
liver insomnia neurotransmitters due to

1318
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,400
neurotoxins you can read and you can see

1319
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,200
neurotoxins that do a really good

1320
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:37,880
explanation in there of neurotoxins

1321
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:41,400
dermatoxin

1322
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:44,960
byproduct so make sure you get into that

1323
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,559
sometime brain fog concentration

1324
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,680
neurotoxins once again floating in the

1325
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:52,920
bloodstream coming from the liver coming

1326
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,760
from an Epstein bar floating around um

1327
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,920
toxic heavy metals also either in the

1328
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,559
brain brain that are also oxidizing but

1329
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:03,079
feeding viruses causing neurotoxins to

1330
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,119
cause more brain fog more confusion more

1331
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,520
concentration that's not a thyroid

1332
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,240
problem that is not a thyroid symptom so

1333
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,839
I'm comforting some of these symptoms so

1334
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,400
you know what's not a thyroid symptom

1335
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:16,520
too chills that's not a thyroid problem

1336
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,440
that's a viral problem someone coming

1337
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,319
down with Hashimoto with serious serious

1338
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,240
fatigue and chills it's blamed on the

1339
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:25,680
Hashimoto no it's not the thyroid

1340
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:28,559
causing problems because the virus is in

1341
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,200
the thyroid it's the virus in general in

1342
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,880
the body causing the problems causing

1343
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,839
the chills causing the fevers causing

1344
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,680
the fatigue causing the neurological

1345
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,799
fatigue that's the Epstein bar that's

1346
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,319
the chronic fatigue syndrome Epstein

1347
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,680
bar what science and research is good at

1348
00:56:43,319 --> 00:56:47,280
though is renaming things they've

1349
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,720
already named chronic fatigue syndrome

1350
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,200
you know five times I don't know what it

1351
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,880
is now they'll probably name it another

1352
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,520
five times just to keep us

1353
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,799
distracted

1354
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:02,000
um cold hands and

1355
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:04,119
feet cold hands and feet is liver

1356
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,039
circulation because of the liver and a

1357
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:10,240
lot of toxins in the liver namely many

1358
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:12,359
could be viral puffy face puffy eyes

1359
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,960
lymphatic system and liver once again

1360
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:17,520
liver being clogged

1361
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,520
up and that's edema that's a mild edema

1362
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,119
and then regular edema if a doctor can't

1363
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,839
find kidney problems or heart problems

1364
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,359
which which is which is easy to find

1365
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,440
with what we have in research science

1366
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,039
thank God and that's what I love about

1367
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,200
research of science is they have so much

1368
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:33,440
that is helpful that I do love in so

1369
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,640
many ways and surgeons I love surgeons I

1370
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,599
love everybody committed to bettering

1371
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,920
people's lives and we have so many great

1372
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,160
things and I've talked about that over

1373
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,799
and over again you guys don't need to

1374
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,960
hear that again from me you know I'm Pro

1375
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:48,240
I'm Pro uh Pro doctor Pro surgeons Pro

1376
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:51,559
Specialists Pro experts too you know

1377
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,280
even know I I say what I say about you

1378
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:54,880
know in the thyroid World in other world

1379
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,559
it's just a chronic illness is falling

1380
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,520
short so I do I do say that everybody is

1381
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:03,280
kind of behind the times in that area of

1382
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,720
course that that that I stand by been

1383
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,480
chronic illness is where it's all

1384
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:10,400
falling through um and has been for

1385
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,280
decades and decades so the puffy face

1386
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,760
puffy eyes that's liver lymphatic

1387
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:17,520
sluggish liver problematic

1388
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,839
liver so these are just some of the

1389
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,520
symptoms um and you can see other

1390
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:25,680
symptoms too that are that are in there

1391
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,920
that are you know of what's going on

1392
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,119
that's a that's another thing now

1393
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,440
medication I want to talk about

1394
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:33,960
medication a little bit of medic

1395
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:36,039
medication is is a funny thing um you

1396
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,240
know talk to your doctor with any of

1397
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:40,119
that um you know your practitioner

1398
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,880
whatever if you want to play with your

1399
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,280
medications you know a lot of doctors

1400
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,839
these days are definitely open to

1401
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,799
playing with medications they're open to

1402
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:48,599
reducing them in case you're getting a

1403
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:52,520
side effect from a medication they're

1404
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:54,319
open to uh changing them sometimes too

1405
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,119
um so they're they're they're they're

1406
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,440
open to to a lot of different things

1407
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,640
some you know I've seen a lot of great

1408
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,039
doctors where they learn about Epstein

1409
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,599
bar they learn about the thyroid they

1410
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,799
see their patient getting better doing

1411
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,119
anti-in bar protocols I've seen this

1412
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,680
because they're doing stuff out of say

1413
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,680
the medical medium book or

1414
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,119
something and um and the doctor

1415
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,839
minimizes the medication for them along

1416
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,839
the way they feel better um and so

1417
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,200
there's a lot of different things you

1418
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:20,839
can do with medication but one thing

1419
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,160
about thyroid medication it does make

1420
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:25,000
the liver sluggish so if someone goes on

1421
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:28,319
thyroid medication because they have a

1422
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,680
hypothyroid say in their 30s or in their

1423
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,920
they're in their 20s so if if you've

1424
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,240
ever experienced that if you know

1425
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:37,520
somebody or maybe it's you going through

1426
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:39,280
it what happens is that if you're on

1427
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,599
that medication for 20 years you're just

1428
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,079
given that medication for Life what

1429
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,520
happens is the medication ends up

1430
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,960
slowing down the liver clogging up

1431
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,680
causing weight gain sometimes it's not

1432
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,359
even the upstein bar somebody's life is

1433
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:56,359
going good where they're not triggering

1434
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:57,839
so easily their Epstein bar

1435
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,599
and you know there's not a lot of

1436
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,400
terrible things happening or stressful

1437
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:06,200
things or changes in their life like big

1438
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,799
breakups and heartbreak and divorces and

1439
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,960
um things that we go through in life

1440
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:11,720
that everybody goes through in life you

1441
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,400
know all the normal things that cause

1442
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,680
stress Financial stress everything else

1443
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,000
the triggers the triggers and you'll see

1444
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,240
the trigger section there so if you're

1445
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,280
not going through a lot of triggers if

1446
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,359
you're not someone that's going through

1447
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,000
a lot of triggers things could all be

1448
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,599
going smooth you got this very mild

1449
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,720
hypothyroid because the mono you had

1450
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,400
that you may not even know you had

1451
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,640
really mild it could be like I talk

1452
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,400
about a medical

1453
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,039
medium that could just literally be

1454
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,960
giving you you know the exposure of a

1455
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:43,520
very mild epine bar in the liver it's

1456
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,359
not doing much then it goes to the

1457
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,160
thyroid causing the hypothyroid in your

1458
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,799
20s or 30s it's not doing much it just

1459
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,160
sits in there it's not doing much and

1460
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:55,760
you don't have a lot of triggers things

1461
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:59,400
are going smooth life is going great

1462
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,160
and next thing you know it though the

1463
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,559
medications end up clogging up the liver

1464
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,400
over time by the time you're get into

1465
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:07,160
your 40s you're noticing weight gain you

1466
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:09,880
can't control and then that gets thrown

1467
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:11,559
into hey you need estrogen testosterone

1468
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,319
you need all everything rebalanced you

1469
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:16,319
need progesterone you need all your you

1470
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:17,920
need all your hormones looked at because

1471
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,359
then the hormone thing gets thrown into

1472
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,119
but really what's happening is you got

1473
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:22,400
this liver problem from old Epstein bar

1474
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,839
sitting in there so long and you got all

1475
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,520
the medications built up from your

1476
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,480
thyroid medication and that happens to

1477
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,359
millions of women where things are kind

1478
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,720
of going smooth they're not getting too

1479
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:34,680
many triggers too many upsets in life um

1480
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,079
and uh just maybe some of the basic

1481
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,880
upsets or basic triggers and you know

1482
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:41,760
the upstein bar hasn't really Advanced

1483
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,839
too far causing too many symptoms and

1484
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,520
then the thyroid medication builds up

1485
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,359
and builds up and builds up in the liver

1486
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,880
from 20 years of thyroid medication

1487
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,599
which is bottles after bottles of

1488
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,240
thyroid medication being stored inside

1489
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:54,799
the liver and then finally weight gain

1490
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,480
comes on then it's blamed on hormones

1491
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:59,599
it's blamed on per menopause it's blamed

1492
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,000
on menopause and if then if they get any

1493
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,599
kind of triggers at that point in your

1494
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,359
life so if you get a trigger in that

1495
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:05,680
point in your life now it's years later

1496
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:07,760
you're in your 40s you're in your early

1497
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,720
50s and you're getting triggers now

1498
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,400
something happens divorce stress or any

1499
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,200
kind of other you know or any kind of

1500
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,520
thing trauma or anything well then the

1501
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,000
virus can amp up a bit causing other

1502
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,720
symptoms fatigue brain fog other things

1503
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,400
and when that happens then the doctor

1504
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,920
say well definitely menopause per

1505
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,359
menopause symptoms and this was the

1506
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,480
mistake made in

1507
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:32,599
1950 this was the mistake made in

1508
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:35,160
1950 and I talk about it here in thyroid

1509
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:37,760
healing but I thought I would you know

1510
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,760
talk about it a little bit also in this

1511
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,760
webinar

1512
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:47,039
um so uh so

1513
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:49,880
basically we don't want to build up that

1514
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,119
much medication in the liver either over

1515
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,720
time so we do want to play with

1516
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:56,039
medication if we can I mean if you're do

1517
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,440
meaning if you're doctor's open to it

1518
01:02:56,039 --> 01:03:00,400
you can talk to your doctor and see if

1519
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:03,359
he's open to it and you do the protocols

1520
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,319
that um that Spirit KN have outlined in

1521
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,799
the book for knocking down Epstein bar

1522
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,559
and what's happening is with these

1523
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:11,680
protocols inside the book it's about

1524
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:15,119
knocking down Epstein

1525
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:17,079
bar that's what it is and that's that's

1526
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,680
the key and it's some some of the

1527
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:21,079
supplements too are to revive the

1528
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,720
thyroid from Epstein bar damage because

1529
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:24,640
we want to protect the thyroid so it can

1530
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,319
keep strong and keep our radio active

1531
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:31,760
frequencies and everything else going on

1532
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:33,279
but it's about the foods not to eat you

1533
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,920
know you do the best you can you take

1534
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:38,279
one thing at a time try not to get

1535
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,520
overwhelmed and you do the best you can

1536
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:42,720
you take out some of the foods that feed

1537
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,520
the virus that you can back down and

1538
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,119
that's what happens with a lot of also

1539
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,559
you know diets out there is they take

1540
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:49,279
away some of the foods or a lot of the

1541
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,559
foods that do feed Epstein bar but they

1542
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:53,039
don't know that that's what they're

1543
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,400
doing and then they call it the thyroid

1544
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:57,799
fix but really what's

1545
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,440
happening when they do get results they

1546
01:03:57,799 --> 01:04:02,839
don't know why they have the wrong

1547
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:05,400
reasons of why they're getting

1548
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:07,799
results it which is fine as long as

1549
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,319
someone's getting results but you need

1550
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:10,720
to know why you're getting results you

1551
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:12,319
can keep on it stay on it so it's

1552
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,760
nothing creeps up and comes back 10

1553
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,559
years down the road 5 years down the

1554
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,240
road or something else happens you want

1555
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:19,920
to really get rid of the epsteen bar and

1556
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,200
clean it up you really want to revive

1557
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,960
your thyroid but you want to know why

1558
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,920
and how and that's that's what we're

1559
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:29,359
trying to do in thyroid healing so that

1560
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,400
once you take out those foods that feed

1561
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,760
the virus and and and cause the virus to

1562
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,720
cause more symptoms and whatnot once you

1563
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,880
you know you're using take out the foods

1564
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,720
that don't help and you're using foods

1565
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,240
that do help revive the thyroid you're

1566
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,319
using foods that do help knock down

1567
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,720
Epstein bar then you're moving forward

1568
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,839
but you know why you're moving forward

1569
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,079
you know what you're after you know what

1570
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:49,720
you're doing and you know why you have

1571
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,799
the auto antibodies and you know why

1572
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,440
things are going on that matters so you

1573
01:04:51,799 --> 01:04:55,440
don't pop off course one day on a

1574
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,880
different

1575
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,000
Trend or you're on the same Trend and

1576
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,480
you're but now you're not getting

1577
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,200
results and you don't know why a year

1578
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,359
later that's because it wasn't really

1579
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:06,440
specifically for what the real knowledge

1580
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:08,480
is which is about knocking down Epstein

1581
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:10,480
bar which is about knocking down the

1582
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,039
viral load it's viral the Epstein bar is

1583
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,440
not a trigger and that's what happened

1584
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:18,119
that's what happened if you read a note

1585
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,720
for you at the beginning of the book

1586
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:22,760
read that note you don't have to read it

1587
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:25,640
now but you know or anytime but when you

1588
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:28,680
get a chance read that note that the

1589
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:33,200
note for you I I wrote that note for

1590
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:35,359
you and in that note it's important to

1591
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,279
understand um some of the things that I

1592
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,400
I put in there because it it it'll help

1593
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:42,520
it'll

1594
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:45,079
help it's because what happens is

1595
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:46,960
that the information for instance like

1596
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:48,200
book one getting Epstein bar out there

1597
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,160
about how it got into the thyroid they

1598
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,880
got a lot of people upset out there they

1599
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,079
got a lot of professionals upset so what

1600
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,200
happened was they started using the

1601
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,079
abene bar thing you know but they're

1602
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,319
using it as a they're putting it in the

1603
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,160
trigger basket which is the wrong place

1604
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,359
they're putting it in a trigger basket

1605
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,520
it's not a trigger it's not a trigger

1606
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:10,520
it's the cause of Hashimoto it's the

1607
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:13,119
cause it's the th it's the cause of

1608
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:16,079
hashimotos it's the cause of Hashimoto

1609
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,119
symptoms it's the cause of hypothyroid

1610
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,319
it's the cause of

1611
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:23,160
hyperthyroid it's the cause of thyroid

1612
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,000
cancer it's the cause so um it's

1613
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:26,920
important to know that

1614
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,279
and and being you know back they're just

1615
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,400
you know when they're trying to protect

1616
01:06:28,279 --> 01:06:32,160
themselves and they're taking our

1617
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,680
knowledge here and then kind of

1618
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,240
manipulating it so it works in their

1619
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:37,599
favor but doesn't work in your favor

1620
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,039
entirely that's just that's that's how

1621
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:43,279
things get messed up and screwed around

1622
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:46,240
with or skewed around with that's how

1623
01:06:43,279 --> 01:06:49,599
that you know that's how that

1624
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,359
happens and um and so just keep an open

1625
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,279
mind when you read a note for you so you

1626
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,000
can kind of say that's why he's saying

1627
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:55,920
all this it's part of why he's saying

1628
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,480
all

1629
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:02,599
this so that's a really

1630
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:04,960
important important fact

1631
01:07:02,599 --> 01:07:07,160
so the deal is with the supplement

1632
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,520
section look supplements are always

1633
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,279
overwhelming take it one day at a time

1634
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,400
the supplements there are geared to

1635
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:16,480
killing off Epstein bar they're geared

1636
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,440
to helping the nervous system recover

1637
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,920
from Epstein bar symptoms they're geared

1638
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:25,559
with they're geared to helping you know

the way you feel you need to go into it

1655
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:01,599
so baby step baby step baby step baby

1656
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,799
step well that's what I would do is baby

1657
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,799
step and if you're confused about what

1658
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:07,680
kind of vitamins because different zinc

1659
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:09,520
and it's true I've seen zincs out there

1660
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,839
where I've tried where I've almost I've

1661
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,640
spit it out and I couldn't believe what

1662
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,440
went in my mouth because it had so much

1663
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:19,440
citric acid in there it was like poison

1664
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:22,440
it had it had so much preservative in

1665
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,960
it I couldn't believe what entered my

1666
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,679
mouth I've tried all so many different

1667
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:30,600
things out there and I I would squirt

1668
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,960
this zinc from a reputable company just

1669
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,239
right in my mouth and and it would burn

1670
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,759
a hole in my mou throat and mouth

1671
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:42,000
because it had it had an ounce of citric

1672
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:45,279
acid just in there oh my God and so for

1673
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,839
that reason I I I put a note in there

1674
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,719
saying go to my directory I don't sell

1675
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:51,799
the supplements on my directory I'm not

1676
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:53,080
in the supplement you know business or

1677
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:55,040
anything like that I don't sell the

1678
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,480
supplements but go to my directory so

1679
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,520
you don't go to the store and buy the

1680
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:01,080
zinc that has all that citric acid in it

1681
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,920
or something like that and it's like

1682
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,560
that with with with all supplements

1683
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:07,920
meaning you just got to be cautious with

1684
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:11,920
whatever so I put I put a note saying if

1685
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,640
you want the ones that I trust that will

1686
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:17,120
you that make that list or whatever then

1687
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:19,799
go to the directory at at Medical medium

1688
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:22,600
and did that to protect you

1689
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:23,759
um and so uh so when it comes down to

1690
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,040
supplements you know work with your

1691
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,319
ition you might have a practitioner

1692
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,319
that's really really liberal with

1693
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:30,839
supplements really liberal and they're

1694
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:32,319

might have practitioners already have

1699
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:42,199

1745
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,719
talking about one or two people I'm

1746
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,400
talking about hundreds of people and

1747
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:35,920
hundreds of people have healed their

1748
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,639

01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,360
you if you need to be slow on

1753
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,480
supplements if you need to be kind of

1754
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,480
you know slow on the subs or slow on you

1755
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,080
need to be slow on the

1756
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,600
foods then take your time then take your

1757
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,960

01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,600
is going to help you take one day at a

1759
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,199
time but you'll get to the foods and

1760
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,239
you'll get to some of the

1761
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:03,880
supplements you'll get to some of those

1762
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:05,600
supplements that are really helpful

1763
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,840
there's a whole thing on iodine in there

1764
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,280
how iodine Works Sea vegetables and so

1765
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,120
forth because there's a complete

1766
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:16,520
misconception out there about iodine

1767
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:18,080
iodine is a disinfectant the reason why

1768
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,880
some people with hashimotos have a

1769
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,440
reaction if they put a whole bunch of

1770
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:24,239
iodine in them because they actually in

1771
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,080
this in this reaction is considered

1772
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:28,440
negative and you don't want a huge

1773
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,080
reaction but it's considered negative to

1774
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,520
practitioners and doctors so they say oh

1775
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,639
stay away from iodine it could flare

1776
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,679
Hashimoto what iodine

1777
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:38,719
does is it goes after the virus meaning

1778
01:12:36,679 --> 01:12:40,719
it actually is a disinfectant it kills

1779
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,719
all bugs all pathogens you put a

1780
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,080
pathogen in a Petri dish and you stick

1781
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,239
iodine in there and guess what the

1782
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,040
pathogen

1783
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:49,880
dies you put iodine in your throat and

1784
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,679
you got Hashimoto's and it's saturated

1785
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:54,639
with Epstein bar that has that that that

1786
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,199
thyroid with Hashimoto is saturated with

1787
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:57,560
with epine bar and you put you put

1788
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:58,800
iodine in there and you're going to get

1789
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,520
you're going to it's like shocking the

1790
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,320
thyroid because it's killing off so many

1791
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,639
bugs you don't want to do it that way

1792
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,719
but you can't be afraid of a little

1793
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:09,840
iodine and a half a teaspoon of

1794
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:12,480
Spirulina or a little touch of iodine

1795
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,760
and some dolls or a little bit of

1796
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,600
kelp because you don't want to be iodine

1797
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,320
deficient with Epstein bar you don't

1798
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,840
want to be iodine efficient with any

1799
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,360
kind of thyroid disease or thyroid

1800
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,199
illness or thyroid

1801
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:27,000
problems so that's something be to

1802
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:29,040
consider you know read that whole area

1803
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,159
read that whole that whole area

1804
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,400
carefully so um that's a whole another

1805
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:38,239
kind of thing

1806
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:41,320
and now you may Wonder there's an

1807
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:44,560
insomnia there's a sleep

1808
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:46,560
section A sleep section in thyroid

1812
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,880
like is it odd is it out of sorts it

1813
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,040
actually the opposite insomnia and

1814
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:05,400
sleeping problems is blamed on thyroid

1815
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:07,840

history maybe you've already experienced

1817
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,159
that because you're sleeping problems

1818
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,480
and then wait a minute your thyroids off

1819
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:15,800
as Hashim Modas that's why you're not

1820
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:18,880
sleeping I hurt it every day I hurt it

1821
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:21,199
every single day out there over and over

1822
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,080
and over again well I've had sleeping

1823
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,120
problems my doctor thinks it's uh it's

1824
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,760
the

1825
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:30,080
thyroid IT it became the easy out

1826
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,719
symptom any kind of sleep problems

1827
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,480
that's your

1828
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:38,440
thyroid so I had to dedicate a section

1829
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:40,520
with multiple chapters in the sleep in

1830
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,239
the Sleep World in the Sleep Department

1831
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:46,159
in the thyroid book I had no

1832
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:48,480
choice because yes it's a symptom but

1833
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,239
it's it's it's now there's so many

1834
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,520
people and you may be experiencing that

1835
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:54,280
are having sleep problems in general

1836
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,080
having sleep problems for anything for

1837
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,520
to to having sleep problems one way or

1838
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,760
another whether it's restless legs or

1839
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,719

1840
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:03,400
having whatever it

1841
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:06,520
is and it's being all thrown in the in

1842
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:08,719
the thyroid basket if it's not diagnosed

1843
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:11,400
with lime which is a whole another thing

1844
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,840
whole another story on down the road

1845
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,520
I'll have to put a whole book out on

1846
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,560
Lime to set the record

1847
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,360
straight I'm definitely going to have to

1848
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:19,960
do that I did a chapter in book one

1849
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,560
medical meeting but I have to do a whole

1850
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,000
a whole book on it and I know that I'm

1851
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:25,639
I'm dreading it I'm dreading it cuz when

1852
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,199
it gets controversial when anything gets

1853
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:28,920
too controversial you just get nothing

1854
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,719
but Stones thrown at you you get

1855
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,960
pitchforks and knives and Tor you know

01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,760
torches you get all that starts

1857
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,719
happening cuz when you put real truth

1858
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:40,360
out there you know what happens which by

1859
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:42,120
the way is there any way any anybody

1860
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:45,440
there if you like thyroid healing can

1861
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:50,000
you put a review on Amazon for spirit

1862
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:51,960
and I Spirit would love it um I like it

1863
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
because the spirit likes it because it

1864
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,480
can help people

1865
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,880
it can truly help them because they'll

1866
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,840
know there's there's some good

1867
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,120
information in this document there's

1868
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,719
some good information that's healing for

1869
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:06,280
people so if you can I know you're busy

1870
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,920
and you got busy lives and it's a pain

1871
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:13,159
in the butt but if you can just put any

1872
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:15,239
kind of review you feel um uh on Amazon

1873
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:17,880
uh for thyroid healing we would be so

1874
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:19,560
grateful grateful grateful because

1875
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,960
there's going to be an onslaught of also

1876
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:23,639
torches and pitchforks because of

1877
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,080
because of how controversial this is

1878
01:16:23,639 --> 01:16:27,679
because when you when you show the truth

1879
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,320
and you show the body's not attacking

1880
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:33,040
itself and you and you try to get the

1881
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,520
truth out there there's also this this

1882
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,400
small army of people that just hate that

1883
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,280
and they end up just you know throwing

1884
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:41,800
stones and rocks so if you can do that

1885
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,560
that would be so appreciated I can't

1886
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,000
even tell you and I hate asking anything

1887
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,760
of you I swear to God I hate

1888
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,639
it because you know I know you're busy

1889
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,520
and I know you got so much going on in

1890
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,560
your life and just know that I care and

1891
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:57,920
I totally understand

1892
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:59,440
that um but when you have the truth in

1893
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,480
your hand it's going to help you in

1894
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,000
every way possible in every way possible

1895
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,719
it's going to

1896
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,639
help so the Sleep Department needed more

1897
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:12,679
it just it just needed more I mean sure

1898
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:15,520
there could be chapters on every single

1899
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:18,600
symptom that's in there that Spirit can

1900
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,760
provide additional information but in

1901
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,480
the Sleep realm it's being packaged into

1902
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,760
thyroid and it's not a thyroid problem

1903
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:27,239
sleeping is not a thyroid

1904
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:30,000
problem but sleeping can be anything

1905
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:32,040
from stress cortisol adrenals viral

1906
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,800
issues like Epstein bar the liver being

1907
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,520
unhappy the liver being sluggish the

1908
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,600
liver being completely burdened um

1909
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:39,760
sensitive nervous systems

1910
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,199
neurotransmitter issues all these

1911
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,560
different things is our sleeping

1912
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,320
problems from different varieties of

1913
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:48,719
stress from different varieties of worry

1914
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,480
from subconscious worry from

1915
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,960
subconscious stress from all kinds of

1916
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:55,280
things could be your sleeping problem so

1917
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,000
so I had to put a good section in there

1918
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,920
because they can't get all picked off as

1919
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,440
just thyroid so it had the record had to

1920
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,159
be set with sleeping so I hope you

1921
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:05,480
enjoyed that there's a chapter in there

1922
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:07,960
a very small one of why bad dreams are

1923
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:10,679
pretty good for you you might get a kick

1924
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:12,639
out of it I know it's t you know it's

1925
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:16,199
it's I know it's taking it's going a

1926
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:16,199
little bit on the spiritual side of

1927
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:23,679
things and um but it's it's

1928
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,440
powerful because what happens is we heal

1929
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,000
through our bad dreams it doesn't mean

1930
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,480
when you have good dreams and only good

1931
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
dreams that you're never healing or

1932
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:33,280
you're a bad person that's not it at

1933
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,080
all I just said every now and then if

1934
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:37,080
you ever get a bad dream one every 10

1935
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:39,600
years one every 30 years one every 20

1936
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:42,040
years is's a reason for it that's your

1937
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,679
body healing if you get a bad dream

1938
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,440
every night there's a reason for it I

1939
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,199
get a bad dream I get bad dreams I do

1940
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,600
some

1941
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:52,120
healing I do some healing I get some bad

1942
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,719
dreams here and there I've seen so much

1943
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:55,159
in my life and I've been through so much

1944
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:56,520
in my life and with this gift and

1945
01:18:55,159 --> 01:19:00,239
everything

1946
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:02,679
else that yeah I have some bad

1947
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:05,639
dreams but that's how you let things

1948
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:06,920
loose and let things out and you heal in

1949
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:08,080
different ways different parts of

1950
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,719
healing you don't have to have bad

1951
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,440
dreams to heal in all kinds of different

1952
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:13,320
ways you don't have to have bad dreams

1953
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,040
to heal your thyroid but just letting

1954
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:17,960
you know since we were talking about

1955
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:21,120
sleep so much in those chapters that I

1956
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:23,760
thought I would throw that little tidbit

1957
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,520
that Spirit has taught me so much

1958
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,080
out and I hope you enjoy it I hope you

1959
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,560
enjoy

1960
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:35,920
it when we get diagnosed with

1961
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,880
something it it can hit us really

1962
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,440
hard you know I when especially when

1963
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,719
when we're younger too when we're

1964
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:46,480
younger I mean I've seen so many people

1965
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:48,360
in their early 20s and late 20s get

1966
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,639
diagnosed with with a thyroid condition

1967
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:53,639
and they feel like their life is

1968
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:55,320
over and and even their spouse or their

1969
01:19:53,639 --> 01:19:57,040
fian or their boyfriends or their

1970
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,639
husbands they just can't they can't hack

1971
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,920
it I've seen this happen so many times

1972
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:02,159
I've seen so many

1973
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:06,159
breakups so many

1974
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:09,679
breakups because it was just scary for

1975
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:12,520
the boyfriend or the husband or the or

1976
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,600
the uh fiance it was just so scary that

1977
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,520
their

1978
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,440
25-year-old partner you know has this

1979
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:19,960
thyroid problem so what next and then

1980
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,440
when you look into thyroid problem and

1981
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,520
you look into Hashimoto of the body

1982
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:26,960
destroying and it's attacking itself

1983
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:29,080
it can make a a person run away from a

1984
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,320
partner and this is one of the most

1985
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:35,120
disturbing reasons I feel is part of the

1986
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,679
misinformation trap that's out there

1987
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:40,159
I've seen

1988
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:42,960
couples completely alter their Destiny

1989
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:45,920
and completely split up when they were

1990
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,400
very happy together because of

1991
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,600
information that floats around in the

1992
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,040
internet and other books like for

1993
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,880
instance like Hashimoto is being the

1994
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,600
body destroying itself which is wrong

1995
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:55,440
it's about the body attacking itself and

1996
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,120
causing all this harm and how where

1997
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,560
things can go if it's not under control

1998
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,040
and all these things and I've seen

1999
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:04,480
people run from each

2000
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:06,800
other and young women just lose partners

2001
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,440
and have to and and just and and wallow

2002
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:13,600
in in agony over that their

2003
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:15,639
diagnosis and it's

2004
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,960
heartbreaking and I I I've seen this

2005
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:20,080
with women in their 30s men and women in

2006
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:23,440
their 30s

2007
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,600
happening and um and even seen it with

2008
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:27,040
women in their

2009
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,639
40s the divorce suddenly happens during

2010
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,840
the Hashim Modas

2011
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,560
diagnosis I've seen

2012
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,199
this and so this is from misinformation

2013
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:38,719
out there that's what this is putting

2014
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:41,960
fear into women and into and into uh the

2015
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:44,000
system in general that creates these

2016
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,679
imbalances what I'm saying is if you've

2017
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,480
been diagnosed young or you're you're

2018
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:50,639
young now and you're diagnos with with

2019
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,159
Hashim just don't fear it don't get

2020
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:53,600
scared don't think your life is over

2021
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:54,880
don't think you're dependent on hormones

2022
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,920
for the rest of your life don't think

2023
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,520
that you're going to have problems for

2024
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,080
the rest of your life don't think any of

2025
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,199
that you've had a little bug in you a

2026
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:05,760
little viral issue that you've had that

2027
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:07,560
frankly most people have in their system

2028
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,320
doing something one way or another that

2029
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:13,080
we all live with that you can clean up

2030
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,760
and break down and help and

2031
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:17,080
restore and get your life back mentally

2032
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,159
emotionally and

2033
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:21,639
physically and you can take control so

2034
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,840
if your moms and you have a daughter

2035
01:22:21,639 --> 01:22:23,679
this is something you can tell daughter

2036
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,120
that's going through the same things

2037
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,440
it's not because mom had it now the

2038
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:29,320
daughter has it and it's genetic that's

2039
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,400
not how it works that's not how it

2040
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,719
works and then your child's going to

2041
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:35,239
have it because it's genetic no that's

2042
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:37,960
not how it works that's another big

2043
01:22:35,239 --> 01:22:40,560
round of misinformation that's out there

2044
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:43,840
that's one more thing I just wanted to

2045
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,600
tell everybody here about before um the

2046
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,960
webinar ends and I just I just wanted

2047
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,920
everybody to know this and it's

2048
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,000
difficult when you're young because

2049
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,920
you're starting your career you're

2050
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,960
trying to look for a career you're

2051
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,159
trying to figure out school you're

2052
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,960
trying to figure out what you're doing

2053
01:22:53,159 --> 01:22:56,120
maybe your job maybe you love your job

2054
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,560
maybe you're doing things and you get

2055
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:59,320
given this diagnosis and you got these

2056
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,320
symptoms you don't understand them you

2057
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:04,600
fight you fight forward you heal up you

2058
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,679
you take what you deserve meaning good

2059
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,239
health and freedom and you grab that

2060
01:23:06,679 --> 01:23:11,320
freedom you deserve it and you take that

2061
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:13,719
and you hold it in your hand and you

2062
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,280
keep that as armor and you fight for it

2063
01:23:13,719 --> 01:23:16,920
and you do what you need to do and I say

2064
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,480
that for anybody in any age it's just

2065
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,159
that the younger people I noticed they

2066
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:23,480
suffer more mentally and emotionally

2067
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:26,520
when they're not feeling well

2068
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:28,800
and and and it's just it's unbelievable

2069
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,600
with with what younger younger people

2070
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,199
have to go through and of course I feel

2071
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,560
that way with everybody no matter what

2072
01:23:32,199 --> 01:23:37,040
age if you're my age or older or

2073
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,639
whatever your age is I feel that for

2074
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,560
everybody but I notice that the world

2075
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:44,360
has changed there's a chapter in there

2076
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:46,679
about creating your illness how we don't

2077
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,679
create our illness I'm noticing that the

2078
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,920
young people are falling tra in prey to

2079
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,120
a Consciousness that's developing a

2080
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,040
trendy trap of how if you're sick with

2081
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:57,320
Hashimoto and you're 25 that means you

2082
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,800
must have wished it on yourself that

2083
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:02,040
means it's bad karma that means you

2084
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,639
created it and that's why that chapter's

2085
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:06,199
in there to clarify that so make sure if

2086
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,560
Mommy if you got a daughter and your

2087
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:09,159
daughter's thinking that because she's

2088
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,800
getting diagnosed with hypothyroid make

2089
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:12,639
sure she reads that

2090
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,480
chapter because there's so much

2091
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,840
misinformation out there once again

2092
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:20,960
about that alone it's poisonous

2093
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:22,920
destructive and it just does so much

2094
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,679
damage to our

2095
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:29,400
children and even even us it does damage

2096
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:31,760
to us too so we need to know we need to

2097
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,760
know that we need to know

2098
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,239
that and if you're one of those that

2099
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,400
thinks it's all in your head for some

2100
01:24:35,239 --> 01:24:40,400
reason no it's not all in your head okay

2101
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:43,440
your symptoms are real and we're

2102
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:45,080
addressing them you better believe it

2103
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,679
we're addressing them the thyroid

2104
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,760
healing that's going to help you address

2105
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:49,920
them the book's going to help you

2106
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,760
address them you take one day at a

2107
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,719
time and you keep a light heart one

2108
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,400
thing about Epstein bar is it becomes

2109
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,800
useless meaning it it breaks down it's

2110
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:01,560
weak and once you know the power that

2111
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,199
you have it breaks down even more your

2112
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,119
immune system goes after it even more

2113
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,600
and does what it needs to do once you

2114
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,960
know what's going on in your system and

2115
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,800
you know what's creating your Hashimoto

2116
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:12,560
you have more power to heal it than ever

2117
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:15,480
before in history in any before in your

2118
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:18,320
life's history any any any ever

2119
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:21,239
before in your own life's

2120
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:23,520
history you have more power to break it

2121
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:25,880
down clean things up move forward and

2122
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,360
heal have patience some epine bars

2123
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,000
they've been around a long time in your

2124
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,840
system you might have had a lot of

2125
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,880
triggers so it could take longer because

2126
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:36,199
of your triggers that's okay you still

2127
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,639
can heal and still will get better over

2128
01:25:36,199 --> 01:25:40,280
time and sometimes there's healing going

2129
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,560
on well all the time there's healing

2130
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:45,280
going on but sometimes the delayed

2131
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,800
effect of saying getting rid of all the

2132
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,679
symptoms and maybe you get rid of six

2133
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,840
symptoms out of 10 some of the symptoms

2134
01:25:48,679 --> 01:25:52,280
that lag a little later are from made

2135
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,760
maybe damaged nerves that need to heal

2136
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,719
heal they need longer times to heal so

2137
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,520
nerves need longer time to heal or other

2138
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:01,199
aspects in the body liver needs a longer

2139
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,920

supplements a little bit I covered the

2180
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:38,400
um Foods a little bit now what I did in

2181
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:40,440
this book is I put a a couple of things

2182
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:43,000
about what the food does and what it's

2183
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:44,440
doing for you when it comes down to

2184
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,040
dealing with any kind of thyroid

2185
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,480
condition and underlying viral problem

2186
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,360
that's actually causing a thyroid

2187
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:51,119
condition I'm I'm or and causing other

2188
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:54,040
symptoms and all kinds of other all

2189
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:55,239
kinds of symptoms I I put you know a

2190
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:57,800
little bit of

2191
01:27:55,239 --> 01:28:00,800
information with each

2192
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,440
food make sure you you look into that

2193
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,840
make sure you read that just don't get

2194
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,239
the food and don't read that because

2195
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,480
it's important to kind of know that that

2196
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:10,719
food is doing something for you that's

2197
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:13,639
another thing that reboots and restores

2198
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:16,920
the immune system and helps clean the

2199
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:18,960
mess up that's inside it's just that

2200
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,199
there's information in food and if you

2201
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,440
know what that information is something

2202
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:26,080
happens with the immune system system as

2203
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:29,560
it uses the food so so when that food

2204
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:31,480
goes in you it's going in you with an

2205
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:33,320
intention your thoughts your

2206
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,400
Consciousness connects to that that that

2207
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:38,080
intention of what the food does for you

2208
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:40,080
anyway your immune system binds on grabs

2209
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:42,880
on to that intention of what the food's

2210
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:45,520
doing for you and literally the food

2211
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,159
even works better for you and even

2212
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:51,000
better so that's why I put those notes

2213
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:54,000
there about every food that's why I did

2214
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that

2215
01:28:54,440 --> 01:29:01,199
um just you know take it one day at time

2216
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,880
take it one day at a time if you feel

2217
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:05,040
like you're getting overwhelmed it's

2218
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:08,840
okay take a little break take one day at

2219
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:10,760
a time whatever you need to do and um

2220
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,600
just have a little patience like you've

2221
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:16,040
always had and if you've been sick for a

2222
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,560
day in your life or know someone who has

2223
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:21,199
you already know that you've you've you

2224
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,880
have patience within you or someone also

2225
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:24,679
that that's been for day in their life

2226
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:28,760
they know you know they have patience

2227
01:29:24,679 --> 01:29:30,760
within them and have some compassion for

2228
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,280
yourself have some compassion for

2229
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,080
yourself your body is not destroying

2230
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:37,040
itself you can heal your Hashimoto you

2231
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,639
can do more than just heal it you can do

2232
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,360
do more than just get the numbers

2233
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:44,320
straight you can do more than just get

2234
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:47,119
your symptoms better you can really get

2235
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:49,760
past this whole thing and keep it

2236
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:52,080
concrete and hold it strong and then go

2237
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:54,199
back to this book and get information to

2238
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,880
keep you stronger and stronger along the

01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:58,760
way so you don't get relapses 10 years

2240
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,119
down the road and everything else

2241
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,639
because the information out there's

2242
01:30:00,119 --> 01:30:04,679
flawed so this can really move you

2243
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:08,440
forward and get you to where you need to
