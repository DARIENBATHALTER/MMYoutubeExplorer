00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,480
always be there for you long before we

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,320
die to bring back and restore a part of

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,320
us that gets beaten down here on Earth

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,399
sending us on a spiritual search because

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,520
we get lost in the Lurch it's time to

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,960
find out what's behind the Stars far far

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,320
away from planet Mars you can't get

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,039
there by driving a car it would be way

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,480
too hard there's an easier way to reach

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,680
Above The Ether and heal the wounds we

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,800
receive from people that are meaner but

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,079
that's okay we can fix all the cracks

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,720
