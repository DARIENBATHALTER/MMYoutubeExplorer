too I soak these almonds so what I love

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,340
about this machine is because it has an

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,980
ability to pulverize to such a degree

13
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,260
it's going to extract nutrients out of

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,180
those almonds that you wouldn't get from

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,920
the traditional store-bought almond milk

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,860
this is the biggest sale on this machine

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,540
ever so far it's a hundred dollars off

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,640
you guys know I work with the mega and

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,440
everything the price is unbelievable for

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,079
what it can do for you and what it has

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
to offer

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,760
okay your mind is going to be blown you

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,160
taste pureness you taste cleanness next

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,160
on the list we're making the guacamole

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,760
a little bit of lime down in there and

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,060
I'm gonna put a little bit of salt down

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,439
there too and there we are right there

28
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,240
probably one of my favorite things to do

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,280
is make the parsley shot which is the

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,619
nerve gut acid stabilizer I'm running

31
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,200
parsley through here parsley is not easy

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,420
to juice and this is totally crushing it

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
you need a powerful juicer that doesn't

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,400
destroy the nutrients but still juices

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,140
The Parsley when you're sick you need a

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,060
main line of direct nutrients and when

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,100
you're using something like the mm-1500

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,860
you're getting that many nutrients out

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,780
of it you're getting a main line

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,240
directly into your system this is

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,159
practically dust good luck with any

42
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,780
other juicer ever seeing that we're

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,460
making a lot of things but this is an

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,079
important one right here right there

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,079
boom check it out

46
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,240
wait a minute here you know what I

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,979
forgot

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,280
ah

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,040
I forgot the natural flavors and the MSG

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,100
and the carrageenan I forgot to put that

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,740
in here oh bummer

52
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,140

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,140
almond milk what was I thinking
