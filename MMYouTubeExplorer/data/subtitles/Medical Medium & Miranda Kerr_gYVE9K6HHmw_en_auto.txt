[44.04 - 48.45] into your bloodstream exactly it's
[46.44 - 49.92] really important that we're conscious of
[48.45 - 51.57] what we're doing and putting on our skin
[49.92 - 53.40] and make an educated choice about it
[51.57 - 54.78] yeah yeah and you've always known this

[68.22 - 74.55] the chemicals and there are some simple
[72.78 - 77.97] things that people actually don't
[74.55 - 80.43] realize and when you understand and you
[77.97 - 82.20] can see what what is you know if you
[80.43 - 84.36] read the ingredients and whatnot on the
[82.20 - 85.92] back of any household goods what's in
[84.36 - 87.57] your hair shampoo what's in your
[85.92 - 89.37] products that you're putting on your
[87.57 - 91.59] skin then you make an educated choice

[101.16 - 107.43] choices about it and I feel like that is
[103.68 - 108.90] the best you can do really no I know you
[107.43 - 110.61] you eat really clean and that's what
[108.90 - 113.16] I've always admired like you're doing
[110.61 - 114.99] them the heavy metal detox movie yeah
[113.16 - 116.73] yeah I nearly mentioning how people
[114.99 - 119.16] think it's gonna be this like really
[116.73 - 122.85] harsh detox or something but it's not
[119.16 - 124.38] yeah this is very gentle smoothie that I
[122.85 - 126.75] love and I have every morning the heavy
[124.38 - 129.69] metal detox amazing with your it's your
[126.75 - 132.15] recipe I love it and I actually have to
[129.69 - 132.49] even be a bit of a bigger bigger one
[132.15 - 135.52] than
[132.49 - 137.97] that's a small one with my celery juice
[135.52 - 142.06] in the morning I have 32 ounces cool
[137.97 - 145.48] that's perfect I tell people I started
[142.06 - 147.25] like this yeah 32 ounces I'm doing so
[145.48 - 149.29] much yeah and you know everyone in my
[147.25 - 152.80] family is drinking celery now even Flynn
[149.29 - 155.38] no way Evan Evan loves e celery he's
[152.80 - 157.33] like he didn't in the beginning he's
[155.38 - 159.22] like oh it's probably not gonna make a
[157.33 - 161.74] difference and now I see he even tells
[159.22 - 163.84] his friends celery celery you've got to
[161.74 - 166.42] get on it's so good it helps just with
[163.84 - 170.38] like the brain fog with energy levels
[166.42 - 171.64] with just health in general I know every
[170.38 - 173.02] now and then you'll hear out there like
[171.64 - 175.15] there's some naysayers saying don't
[173.02 - 177.07] drink celery juice you don't want a
[175.15 - 179.44] juice celery you want to keep the fiber
[177.07 - 181.93] and I'm always like no no no what this
[179.44 - 183.91] is an herbal this is an herbal power
[181.93 - 186.97] right here it's a table medicine
[183.91 - 190.24] alkaline system yeah fast though like
[186.97 - 192.46] fast versus slow alkalinity it actually
[190.24 - 193.93] alkaline this quickly and that's
[192.46 - 195.67] something that happens too that's why
[193.93 - 197.17] people get relief with acid reflux
[195.67 - 200.38] almost immediately
[197.17 - 203.11] yes and all of that actually when I was
[200.38 - 206.26] younger I had a little bit of acid
[203.11 - 208.71] reflux and I think it was emotional at
[206.26 - 211.27] the time because I had lost my boyfriend
[208.71 - 213.76] he had passed away instantly in a car
[211.27 - 216.52] accident and I had to worry and concern
[213.76 - 219.79] and that had brought like kind of you
[216.52 - 221.05] know how emotion you have a loss I've
[219.79 - 222.43] talked about that in the medical meeting
[221.05 - 224.86] books they talked about that in medical
[222.43 - 226.27] media book one and they're some of the
[224.86 - 229.30] other medical media books that like when
[226.27 - 232.54] you get that great loss and and
[229.30 - 235.30] something so so hard and a struggle like
[232.54 - 237.88] that it's it could really hit you hard
[235.30 - 239.59] too on a whole nother but I wish that I
[237.88 - 241.30] had known about celery juice back then
[239.59 - 244.36] because it would have really helped like
[241.30 - 246.37] soothe soothe my digestion and now it
[244.36 - 247.69] does every day which I'm so great well
[246.37 - 249.85] you've been doing it long term too
[247.69 - 251.32] that's what's cool like and I tell
[249.85 - 252.52] people I tell you guys out there all the
[251.32 - 254.44] time and I tell other people I run into
[252.52 - 256.75] all the time you just don't do it for
[254.44 - 258.70] just five days don't do it for and to
[256.75 - 260.53] seven days and you're done and every day
[258.70 - 262.96] every day yeah and you're doing every
[260.53 - 267.61] day for a long time now
[262.96 - 269.32] for a couple yeah that's really cool and
[267.61 - 270.79] this made the biggest difference and
[269.32 - 272.38] continues to make the biggest difference
[270.79 - 275.13] to my health and I thought I was healthy
[272.38 - 278.05] before I met you and you have taught me
[275.13 - 281.05] so much more than what I even thought
[278.05 - 282.82] you know I even thought was even out
[281.05 - 285.43] there and obviously every day we're
[282.82 - 287.68] learning more and more and sure and
[285.43 - 291.28] that's obviously what life is about but
[287.68 - 293.59] it's these simple things like the celery
[291.28 - 295.93] juice like having the banana and
[293.59 - 297.82] actually potatoes yeah I love
[295.93 - 299.50] everybody's afraid about that I love the
[297.82 - 303.46] fact that you're really all about
[299.50 - 305.62] potatoes and incorporating like potatoes
[303.46 - 308.35] steamed potatoes into your diet and not
[305.62 - 312.07] being afraid of the cards yeah
[308.35 - 313.99] because they've also been like since I
[312.07 - 315.94] met you a staple in my diet that's
[313.99 - 318.64] incredible and the potatoes have been
[315.94 - 321.01] really helping me as well that's amazing
[318.64 - 322.18] it's very soothing yeah you know and my
[321.01 - 323.08] cleanser heal book that's gonna be
[322.18 - 326.44] coming out you guys
[323.08 - 328.09] that book I mean potatoes play a big
[326.44 - 329.65] role in that it's really important
[328.09 - 331.15] because there's you can mono eat with
[329.65 - 332.77] potatoes they're so good for you for
[331.15 - 334.63] healing problems with the digestive
[332.77 - 337.18] tract and the intestinal tract and
[334.63 - 339.10] they're so soothing but meanwhile it's
[337.18 - 340.81] funny they're like hated out there
[339.10 - 343.42] they're hate and what I always find out
[340.81 - 345.85] there is they're usually hated by people
[343.42 - 348.40] in the industry that don't know what
[345.85 - 349.87] causes chronic illness so it's like wait
[348.40 - 351.85] a minute if you don't know what causes
[349.87 - 353.47] all the different conditions out there
[351.85 - 354.91] that women are suffering with the
[353.47 - 357.31] fibromyalgia and the chronic fatigue
[354.91 - 359.47] syndrome and and like rheumatoid
[357.31 - 361.00] arthritis and the Lyme disease and all
[359.47 - 362.77] these other things that are now becoming
[361.00 - 364.87] mysterious like even Lyme disease is now
[362.77 - 367.00] a mystery to the industry because it's
[364.87 - 368.74] autoimmune now they say so with all of
[367.00 - 370.45] that it's like and then we're gonna hate
[368.74 - 372.61] on a potato I've seen people get their
[370.45 - 375.55] lives back from those potatoes I mean
[372.61 - 378.34] potatoes and yeah like really really
[375.55 - 381.49] helpful especially for digestive issues
[378.34 - 383.71] oh yeah the steamed potatoes and what
[381.49 - 385.33] are some of your recipes that are so
[383.71 - 387.31] yummy you've got a whole bunch of them
[385.33 - 389.86] and they they have the potatoes in them
[387.31 - 391.42] yeah I mean there's that I think we have
[389.86 - 393.25] a whole bunch of them exactly there's
[391.42 - 395.74] all kinds of ways you can make them and
[393.25 - 396.73] steamed potatoes are liked I know
[395.74 - 398.89] everybody likes to bake
[396.73 - 401.62] potatoes yeah and it makes it fun yeah
[398.89 - 404.17] right but Dean potatoes I'd they're
[401.62 - 406.77] quite addictive I feel yeah really
[404.17 - 410.65] nourishing they're filling yeah and
[406.77 - 412.57] right before I came here I was at an
[410.65 - 414.76] event and then I packed because I always
[412.57 - 416.80] pack my food in the car so I packed a
[414.76 - 419.26] salad I had steamed potatoes and then I
[416.80 - 421.81] just wrapped it in a little seaweed roll
[419.26 - 425.32] yeah and I was able to eat it on my way
[421.81 - 426.73] here to see you and it was easy it was
[425.32 - 428.80] easy it was easy
[426.73 - 431.26] yeah very easy and you don't have to
[428.80 - 433.36] worry about it going bad so it's easy to
[431.26 - 435.10] you know travel with because everyone
[433.36 - 438.79] these days is on the go whether or not
[435.10 - 440.95] they're going to work or running getting
[438.79 - 442.39] on an aeroplane no not you didn't take
[440.95 - 444.16] them with you you could steam a bunch of
[442.39 - 446.26] them the night before you can have them
[444.16 - 447.94] in the fridge take them with you what I
[446.26 - 450.16] like about this the potato is it's got
[447.94 - 452.71] l-lysine in it and l-lysine
[450.16 - 454.45] is actually what knocks down all of
[452.71 - 455.95] those viral issues that everybody's
[454.45 - 456.58] struggling with with all their different
[455.95 - 459.10] conditions
[456.58 - 461.98] you know eczema psoriasis and like the
[459.10 - 463.57] fibro the CFS and the lupus and and
[461.98 - 464.68] that's why it's so important to have
[463.57 - 467.95] those potatoes they're actually a
[464.68 - 469.75] medicine which is really cool nobody
[467.95 - 470.77] really knows that they just think oh
[469.75 - 472.51] it's bad and what they're really
[470.77 - 474.37] thinking or what they're really
[472.51 - 479.98] associating the potato with is all the
[474.37 - 490.21] sour cream the butter cheese you don't
[479.98 - 491.62] want to be any more so that's really
[490.21 - 493.60] cool because that's what makes it work
[491.62 - 495.49] well you know what I asked so fine about
[493.60 - 496.99] the potatoes is so funny that we expect
[495.49 - 499.03] us to be talking about potatoes is is
[496.99 - 500.68] really cool yeah you don't know what
[499.03 - 503.35] you're gonna know what's gonna know it's
[500.68 - 504.70] gonna bother and the potato is great for
[503.35 - 507.40] like food poisoning when people get food

[518.02 - 522.88] has told me this going back decades now

[522.88 - 526.60] healing and recovery from food poisoning
[524.74 - 528.64] is using it yeah just like steamed
[526.60 - 530.04] potatoes yeah you can also blend them
[528.64 - 531.72] right make like a potato soup
[530.04 - 534.00] after you've been through the heck of
[531.72 - 535.86] the total like up sets of the food
[534.00 - 537.45] poisoning for a good few days and you're

[544.41 - 548.58] you're just dealing with leftover
[545.82 - 550.74] foodborne illness and then you bring in
[548.58 - 552.42] those potatoes as your recovery food a
[550.74 - 554.34] little bit at a time and it can bring
[552.42 - 555.69] people back I've seen so many women
[554.34 - 558.02] struggling with food poisoning issues
[555.69 - 560.25] where they can't eat foods and and
[558.02 - 561.87] actually get comfort eating really
[560.25 - 563.46] anything they're struggling for months
[561.87 - 565.29] after food poisoning I've seen some
[563.46 - 567.15] people where it's like six months
[565.29 - 569.13] nothing is right they have gastritis
[567.15 - 570.87] they have bloating they have all these
[569.13 - 573.30] things after it they go and I've always
[570.87 - 575.49] seen potatoes be that answer to help
[573.30 - 577.86] bring people back so it's so cool and
[575.49 - 579.87] same with the coconut water right yeah
[577.86 - 582.69] coconut water with bananas yeah you
[579.87 - 593.76] taught me yeah that's the best yeah just
[582.69 - 596.55] make a shake blend it now the
[593.76 - 598.65] carbohydrate here I am breastfeeding
[596.55 - 600.30] mothers gonna eat again well that's how
[598.65 - 602.61] you build breast milk yes stolen it's
[600.30 - 605.85] like carbs build the breast milk yeah if
[602.61 - 607.38] you take a snack you know I've seen this
[605.85 - 609.03] over the years with so many people that
[607.38 - 611.01] have come to me looking for help
[609.03 - 614.04] had doctors talked to me about this I've
[611.01 - 616.71] had and where there's difficulty
[614.04 - 623.16] building breast milk with women hmm you
[616.71 - 625.68] know after birth and what happens is the
[623.16 - 627.81] trainer's help and yeah that's exactly
[625.68 - 630.48] and and any kind of any kind of food
[627.81 - 632.64] with glucose because breast milk breast
[630.48 - 632.97] milk is basically glucose so that's what
[632.64 - 634.98] it is
[632.97 - 638.43] it's a carb it's a carb drink it's sugar
[634.98 - 639.39] water and there's very low fat very low
[638.43 - 642.21] fat and breast milk
[639.39 - 644.07] exactly and really low in protein that's
[642.21 - 647.16] the breast milk is it's low protein it's
[644.07 - 649.32] low fat and and it's filled with sugar
[647.16 - 652.08] water yeah so breast milk is so if you
[649.32 - 654.06] and there's so many women that were if
[652.08 - 656.49] they go like where they're just all high
[654.06 - 658.44] protein no car but while trying to build
[656.49 - 660.84] breast milk they lose the breast milk so
[658.44 - 661.93] to bring the bring breast milk back it
[660.84 - 664.21] saves me like know you got
[661.93 - 666.49] bananas in you got to bring potatoes in
[664.21 - 669.88] but not as a great yeah so it's really
[666.49 - 671.71] important that's really cool yeah like I

[809.61 - 815.56] constructed like this and for one is in
[813.16 - 818.20] order to get a nutrient into our cells
[815.56 - 820.54] you have it has to be glucose that
[818.20 - 822.34] drives it into the cell so nutrients
[820.54 - 824.20] like if we take supplements all day long
[822.34 - 825.40] and we you know because there's some
[824.20 - 826.78] great supplements out there and there's
[825.40 - 828.31] different things or some foods that you

[892.93 - 896.71] to be honest I've never felt better
[894.58 - 899.17] that's because I'm eating healthy and
[896.71 - 901.21] I'm taking care of myself and you know
[899.17 - 903.82] I've always said it's about a balance
[901.21 - 907.63] and I like to have like 80% healthy and
[903.82 - 911.16] 20% indulgent but you've been mentoring
[907.63 - 914.26] me to be more strict with myself which
[911.16 - 917.10] has definitely been paying off in the
[914.26 - 920.20] way that I feel my energy levels and and
[917.10 - 922.33] health but your you know what though you
[920.20 - 925.00] like it you get committed you get

[943.97 - 948.71] always like you know you're always like
[945.71 - 950.57] on it so that when I do a check-in la

[956.12 - 961.88] difference and look as I said life is a
[959.69 - 964.88] balance it's about being educated making
[961.88 - 968.81] those choices having healthy choices the
[964.88 - 970.25] celery juice is really just like it
[968.81 - 971.78] takes things to a nice level yeah it
[970.25 - 973.58] just takes things to that whole other
[971.78 - 975.20] level of health and wellness and I'm
[973.58 - 977.33] just so grateful for that so thank you
[975.20 - 978.74] well look it's spirit of compassion I
[977.33 - 980.96] wouldn't I wouldn't know about it I
[978.74 - 983.63] would never know just these sweet celery
[980.96 - 985.34] juice because everybody like mocked that
[983.63 - 987.11] what they called a vegetable they
[985.34 - 989.18] thought that things just crudité you
[987.11 - 992.36] know that it's just chopped you know you
[989.18 - 994.43] chop that anything yeah you can chop it
[992.36 - 997.43] up into a salad I guess put a little in
[994.43 - 1001.21] a salad you know you can ya put in a dip
[997.43 - 1003.61] basically so so you know and but it's
[1001.21 - 1005.89] like for me it started in 1975 when I
[1003.61 - 1008.26] was this little kid and and spirit of
[1005.89 - 1010.69] compassion was like this is gonna be an
[1008.26 - 1012.25] answer right here for a family member
[1010.69 - 1013.87] that had a struggling back problem and
[1012.25 - 1015.58] it fixed it and then Wow
[1013.87 - 1017.74] and then spirit compassion was like you
[1015.58 - 1019.78] know there's just like I remember spirit
[1017.74 - 1021.70] compassion trying to convince me because
[1019.78 - 1024.07] I was just like you sure I should keep
[1021.70 - 1025.60] on recommending celery juice and I was
[1024.07 - 1027.31] eight and nine years old and 10 years
[1025.60 - 1029.44] old Spears like you know you have to
[1027.31 - 1033.18] recommend this because this is going to
[1029.44 - 1035.89] be that that that basically that
[1033.18 - 1038.05] safeguard for people's health like no
[1035.89 - 1040.21] other that's ever happened on this plan
[1038.05 - 1042.55] it's going to be that that tool that
[1040.21 - 1044.98] takes everybody to next level protects
[1042.55 - 1047.11] them helps them recover if they're doing
[1044.98 - 1048.91] something good for themselves this will
[1047.11 - 1051.55] help take them to that next level even
[1048.91 - 1052.69] more so and even if they're not doing
[1051.55 - 1054.94] anything good for themselves it's gonna
[1052.69 - 1057.25] help them yeah if you do it every day
[1054.94 - 1058.98] it's an everyday thing I think don't you
[1057.25 - 1061.41] think it's important this in every
[1058.98 - 1064.80] it's like brushing your teeth it's true
[1061.41 - 1067.76] exact on expect to have clean teeth if
[1064.80 - 1070.05] you don't brush them it's like yeah
[1067.76 - 1071.73] consistency I really feel is important
[1070.05 - 1073.23] like and I feel like a lot of people
[1071.73 - 1075.12] might go on it for a little bit then
[1073.23 - 1080.01] they go off it but it's really important
[1075.12 - 1082.32] to maintain the celery juice one little
[1080.01 - 1084.24] thing you can do yeah right it's one you
[1082.32 - 1086.16] know it should be like part of your life
[1084.24 - 1091.47] you should just like when you're taking
[1086.16 - 1093.39] showers exactly this should be in there
[1091.47 - 1094.74] just like anything like anything you do
[1093.39 - 1096.42] you put gas in your car you're always
[1094.74 - 1097.77] gonna put gas through always decelerate
[1096.42 - 1100.37] just whatever it is something that you
[1097.77 - 1103.41] know you always do in your life and
[1100.37 - 1105.03] whatever that is but celery juice should
[1103.41 - 1107.46] always be a part of it like yeah
[1105.03 - 1111.48] brushing your teeth like all of that
[1107.46 - 1113.04] it's so important and I forgot to remind
[1111.48 - 1119.49] everybody if you like this video thumbs
[1113.04 - 1121.05] do give us a thumbs up but the bottom
[1119.49 - 1123.54] line is what celery juice I find all the
[1121.05 - 1125.01] time you know miranda is that people
[1123.54 - 1128.28] will be like well I tried it for seven
[1125.01 - 1131.10] days or I did it for 30 days and then I
[1128.28 - 1133.65] stopped doing it and I noticed I was
[1131.10 - 1135.75] actually feeling better from it so the
[1133.65 - 1137.61] stop effect when people actually do it
[1135.75 - 1139.44] just long enough and then they stop it
[1137.61 - 1142.17] and then they're just like whoa
[1139.44 - 1144.24] something changed I gotta go back on it
[1142.17 - 1146.13] but actually it actually reminds you to
[1144.24 - 1148.47] go back on it it has an ability to
[1146.13 - 1150.39] remind people to go back on it how much
[1148.47 - 1153.60] do you drink celery juice a day do you
[1150.39 - 1160.29] know me yeah 64 ounces is what I try to
[1153.60 - 1163.68] do okay wait no 30 like today it's been
[1160.29 - 1165.33] this plus it was 32 this morning okay
[1163.68 - 1166.98] so it's probably not I don't know I
[1165.33 - 1169.26] don't think that's 64 today but there's
[1166.98 - 1170.64] a lot of days where I'm like I'm like 16
[1169.26 - 1172.38] ounces like I don't have it in the
[1170.64 - 1173.88] fridge I take one bunch out that's all I
[1172.38 - 1177.60] have and I run it through and I got like
[1173.88 - 1179.01] I got 16 ounces which is the which I
[1177.60 - 1181.14] like to use that is the bottom line for
[1179.01 - 1182.46] people but yeah the bottom line is empty
[1181.14 - 1183.75] stomach first thing in the morning empty
[1182.46 - 1185.34] stomach first thing in the morning and
[1183.75 - 1187.20] if you want to have additional salary
[1185.34 - 1188.71] throughout the day you can just do the
[1187.20 - 1190.78] empty stomach
[1188.71 - 1192.25] 'banahna oh no it doesn't have that's
[1190.78 - 1193.96] still really helpful just don't put
[1192.25 - 1196.45] anything in it do you have what do you
[1193.96 - 1199.96] find it like that all that your friends
[1196.45 - 1206.62] can I add lemon I'm like no I am celery
[1199.96 - 1208.12] yeah what about a carrot I might know
[1206.62 - 1210.13] everybody wants to put something in it
[1208.12 - 1211.63] or mix it with something oh my god my
[1210.13 - 1214.57] celery cheese put add parsley in there
[1211.63 - 1216.10] and it happened and that's ok but it's
[1214.57 - 1217.72] not gonna give it would it it's not
[1216.10 - 1220.18] gonna let it do what it needs to do to
[1217.72 - 1222.28] help us recover and help us get to where
[1220.18 - 1224.02] we need to go yeah but you're really
[1222.28 - 1225.70] eating amazing you oh you know you're
[1224.02 - 1227.98] really eating really cleanup you're
[1225.70 - 1229.99] doing 32 ounces that's mind-blowing a
[1227.98 - 1232.36] lot of you guys are probably now doing
[1229.99 - 1235.12] 32 ounces some of you guys are doing 16
[1232.36 - 1236.92] but 16 is always that like hey you know
[1235.12 - 1238.72] that's what you need to have it run
[1236.92 - 1241.33] through the body get up to the liver go
[1238.72 - 1243.28] up into go up into your brain clean
[1241.33 - 1244.84] everything out and send up heavy metal
[1243.28 - 1247.24] so the heavy metal detox movie can
[1244.84 - 1249.55] actually pull out the metals even easier
[1247.24 - 1251.68] and can you tell me more about the lemon
[1249.55 - 1255.43] water just like because being doing that
[1251.68 - 1258.28] lately as well just cut your lemon water
[1255.43 - 1261.28] yeah 32 ounces one lemon
[1258.28 - 1263.11] perfect why you wake up in the morning
[1261.28 - 1265.18] like all night long your liver is now
[1263.11 - 1266.65] working it's working for you so whatever
[1265.18 - 1268.57] you did if you if you're on a high-fat
[1266.65 - 1269.89] diet if you're doing lots of fats during
[1268.57 - 1272.74] the day and people are like I'm not on a
[1269.89 - 1277.18] high-fat diet well if you're on nut
[1272.74 - 1279.10] butters nut butters lots of avocados are
[1277.18 - 1281.35] good for you it's just that we eat a lot
[1279.10 - 1283.63] more of them than we should and that's
[1281.35 - 1285.28] what happens and so your nut butters the
[1283.63 - 1287.68] avocado you're on all the coconut oil
[1285.28 - 1289.48] then you're then maybe you're doing some
[1287.68 - 1291.88] dairy maybe you're doing some goat's
[1289.48 - 1293.74] milk whatever it could be and or chicken
[1291.88 - 1296.11] and so you're doing too many fats
[1293.74 - 1297.64] throughout a day and then hey look if
[1296.11 - 1299.38] you're not struggling with anything and
[1297.64 - 1300.97] you're doing all the fats then your
[1299.38 - 1302.38] liver will just kind of hang in there
[1300.97 - 1303.43] for a while until it gets sluggish down
[1302.38 - 1304.99] the road then you'll get your first
[1303.43 - 1307.96] symptoms and then have to lower the fats
[1304.99 - 1310.18] but what happens is that the lemon water
[1307.96 - 1312.04] is there to flush out those poisons and
[1310.18 - 1314.11] toxins that get built up by the liver
[1312.04 - 1316.66] ready to deliver into the system ready
[1314.11 - 1318.64] to get out so every single night it's
[1316.66 - 1320.05] like there's a there's a workshop going
[1318.64 - 1321.10] on and your liver a bunch of elves are
[1320.05 - 1321.64] in there and they're just working on
[1321.10 - 1323.77] getting all the
[1321.64 - 1326.08] without packaging up getting them ready
[1323.77 - 1327.70] and then that 32 ounces of lemon water
[1326.08 - 1328.99] and it's really important that it's 32
[1327.70 - 1330.94] ounces somewhere around there unless you
[1328.99 - 1334.24] can't do that and I totally get it so do
[1330.94 - 1336.64] less I do it I make sure I bought a 32
