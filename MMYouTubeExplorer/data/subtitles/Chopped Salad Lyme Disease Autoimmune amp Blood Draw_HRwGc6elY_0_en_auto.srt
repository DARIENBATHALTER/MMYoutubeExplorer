and

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
i think i think what happens to the

126
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,120
system doesn't realize that

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
medical medium information is medical

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,240
medium information

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
um all of medical medium information in

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
all the books

131
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
is original and unique and comes from

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,160
the source

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
and you guys know because if you read

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
the first chapter origins of the medical

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
medium right here

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
in this book new edition you'll read

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
about the source

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,479
in which the information comes from all

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
the information in this book

140
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,000
okay and in the medical mean books is

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,880
advanced and it's

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,880
decades ahead of science and research so

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,880
medical medium information

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,039
is going to be fact checked because they

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
don't realize it but it gets fact

146
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,400
checked back to me

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,919
because it's original and unique and

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
that's why millions are healing around

149
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
the world

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
so you can't just take medical medium

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
information

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,080
type it in and try to find it somewhere

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,600
else unless someone else has

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
taken it and they're not citing it but

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
it's the original from the source so

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
you're gonna see that you're gonna see

157
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,880
you're gonna see a post that will be

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
like fact check

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
this isn't true well that's kind of

160
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,280
funny because

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,600
it is because it's this is the source so

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,120
they just don't realize that and medical

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
science research is taking all my

164
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,720
information

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,360
now so they're taking the information

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,199
and

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,400
using it out there and it was published

168
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
first here

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,440
in this book published first that says a

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
lot doesn't it when you really think

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
about it

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
what does that tell you so i put unique

173
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,759
original information in the medical

174
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
medium book

175
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,400
and then years later science and

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,000
research steals it out of the book

177
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,280
right plagiarizes it and then they start

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
to use it

179
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,240
even though it's already been published

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,720
so legally

181
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,520
it is here published and documented

182
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,199
first

183
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
and years later science research they

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,840
can't come up with their own answers to

185
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,080
why everybody's sick so they had to

186
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,600
steal medical mediums

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
it's actually incredible when you think

188
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
about it it's also really insane too

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,960
like

190
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
i mean are they that desperate where

191
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,520
they could just knock on my door and say

192
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
hey well you

we choose truth michelle l we choose

198
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
truth over studies

199
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,120
i mean how many studies get people

200
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
better none

201
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,319
that's what's really demented about it

202
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,160
all right

203
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
i mean you could be sick for 30 years

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
with thyroid problems fibromyalgia

205
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,160
multiple sclerosis symptoms seen 20 30

206
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
specialists

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,440
and the study on matcha tea is not going

208
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
to fix you

209
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,319
they're busy with studies you know

210
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
they're busy with studies with all kinds

211
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
of stuff

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,599
they're studying wine they're studying

213
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
alcohol they're studying wine

214
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,960
just give you the stress benefits that's

215
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,400
what they're studying meanwhile

216
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,319
people are sick all around the world

217
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,039
with autoimmune in all kinds of ways i

218
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
mean

219
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,280
dying sick and they're studying

220
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,360
wine they'll pay for studies on this

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
group of people drinking wine

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
seems to have a lower reduced stress

223
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,840
level

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
paid for by the wine companies this

225
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,280
group here

226
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,440
who's not drinking wine seem to be a

227
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,840
little bit more uptight

228
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,160
and upset maybe because they're not

229
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
drunk

230
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:17,120
all right

231
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
okay thanks to the readers who went into

232
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,720
action

233
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:25,120
with the information here in this book

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,680
this book has prompted medical research

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
and science to recategorize

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,320
lyme disease this book prompted medical

237
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,800
research and science to recategorize

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,760
lyme disease i mean talking about

239
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,959
powerful what a powerful book

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,159
it's unbelievable while labeling lyme as

241
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,440
autoimmune

242
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,360
because that's what they did because of

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
this book still does not represent a

244
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,040
full understanding of lyme symptoms

245
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,720
this recategorization is a way for

246
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,000
medical research and science to admit

247
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,920
we don't understand this as well as we

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
thought we did

249
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,760
so medical research and science doesn't

250
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
understand lyme disease

251
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,800
or anything else in chronic illness as

252
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
much as they thought they did

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,720
especially lyme disease and that's a

254
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,720
major shift toward progress if you think

255
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,839
about it you guys it's a testament

256
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
to the people who read here in medical

257
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,920
medium

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:28,080
that lyme disease is viral eureka

259
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,320
viral not bacterial

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
okay who brought that information to

261
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,839
their doctors and who applied

262
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,000
the healing protocols here and got

263
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
results

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
it's also thanks to the doctors who have

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,240
educated themselves with this material

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,640
as they work to help their patients

267
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
many doctors have even applied the

268
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,839
healing protocols in their

269
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,640
own lives with their own lyme disease

270
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,600

275
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,839

read together

283
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,600
right and let's do that now let's read a

284
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
little bit before i start

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
chopping up some salad good to see you

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
guys

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
you got the few you got the book a few

288
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
days ago

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
um have you done you have you tapped

290
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,320
into the book

291
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,880
i hope so hope you got a chance

292
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
ariana why is everything viral epstein

293
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,600
barr

294
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
well science research believes

295
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,560
everything's genetic

296
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,279
your genes anya so that's what they

297
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,880
believe

298
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,680
so the question is why does research in

299
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
science

300
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
medical research and science believe

301
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
that every single thing is

302
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
is genetic so that's the question you

303
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
have to be asking

304
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,560
like why is research in science thinking

305
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,680
it's all genetic so every single disease

306
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,440
you have now

307
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,600
out there every single symptom every

308
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
single condition is genetic now

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,279
so it's not like why is everything

310
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,480
epstein-barr

311
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,240
anthony no why research in science is

312
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959
everything genetic

313
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,720
that's all they have as an answer so

314
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
think about that right

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,519
when you're functional medicine doctor

316
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,399
or your practitioner a natural

317
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,760
practitioner

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,440
when they they do all their magic spells

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,040
we'll try a little this we'll try a

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,959
little apple cider vinegar here take

321
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
these fish oil capsules hey take this

322
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,560
supplement here

323
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,839
let's do this test maybe we can do this

324
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
whatever they do and in the end they

325
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,839
still believe

326
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,600
it's your genes in the end

327
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
if you really beat them down on the

328
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,560
ground enough about it it's your genes

329
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,800
so it's not about and plus i don't say

330
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,639
epstein-barr is everything

331
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,360
i don't say everything fc bar is

332
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,800
everything simplex one

333
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,800
i talk about a lot hhv-6

334
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,079
the shingles virus has over 30 varieties

335
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,240
of mutated strains

336
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
the epstein bar is not one virus the

337
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,560
epstein-barr virus is over 60 varieties

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
of mutated strains and they do different

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,720
things

340
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,440
toxic heavy metals i talk about a lot of

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,680
the books

342
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,880
radiation okay toxic heavy metals

343
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,200
talk about that and

344
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
pharmaceuticals causing problems like

345
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,600
all of it so everything's not

346
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,079
epstein-barr

347
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,079
but a lot of stuff is epstein-barr

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,680
so yeah so you guys

349
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,519
i'm gonna read a little bit in here and

350
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,519
then we're gonna get making a salad i'm

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,279

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,079
i got youtube live right here which is

353
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,839
really cool

354
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
i also talk about high fat diets being

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,959
harmful too so it's not just epsom bar

356
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,800
it's high fat diets beating down your

357
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,360
liver giving you a stagnant sluggish

358
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,600
liver

359
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
doing harm i talk about all the trends

360
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,160
that are bad

361
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
like all the bad trends that cause

362
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,600
trouble

363
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
i talk about a lot of stuff and then i

364
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,160
talk about the emotional aspect

365
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,240
not just epstein-barr i talk about the

366
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,480
emotional aspect the trail

367
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
happens with your adrenals what happens

368
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
when you're in fight or flight

trust

372
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,000
and betrays you stabs you in the back or

373
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,279

375
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,240
all kinds of stress that people go

376
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,240
through i talk about that medical medium

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,800
information is really vast with a lot of

378
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,800
information

379
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
pam question there on facebook do you

380
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
think epstein-barr is part of your

381
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,160
genetics

382
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
wow 65 it's here it's not part of

383
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,519
genetics viruses have nothing to do with

384
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,720
genes at all at all

385
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:58,320
nothing to do with genes so

386
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:02,160
a virus just so you know

387
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,560
okay a virus is a microorganism

388
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
it has nothing to do with your jeans

389
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,560
it's

390
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,760
absolutely nothing to do it's a bug it's

391
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,120
on its own

392
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,800
it's it's a bug um does a fly flying

393
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,279
around a room have anything to do with

394
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
your genes

395
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
does it when you get food poisoning from

396
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,160
a foodborne

397
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,839
microorganism a bad parasite on a piece

398
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,639
of meat or a piece of

399
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,079
raw fish and you get the food does that

400
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
have something to do your genes

401
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,680
i don't i don't think so right it

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
doesn't at all

403
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,199
the virus that you can contract okay so

404
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,600
say you've got

405
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,040
mono which is the epstein-barr virus and

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,320
you kiss somebody

407
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,480
right in a relationship that person

408
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,079
then catches mono is that their genes

409
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,279
why would that be their genes they just

410
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,959
caught mono from you

411
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:07,360
so when you go into a public bathroom

412
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,279
and you sit on a toilet after somebody

413
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,519
has fecal matter on the toilet and in

414
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,560
that fecal matter

415
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,399
the poop on the toilet there's viruses

416
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,279
all in it because they're sick with the

417
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,880
hhv-6 or epstein-barr or shingles and

418
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,560
you sit on the toilet and you

419
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,560
catch the virus somehow

420
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,839
is that your genes

421
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,800
and kiss somebody with a cold sore and

422
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,839
you've got

423
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
the simplex one virus and you got a

424
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,120
fever blister

425
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,240
and you kissed them and now they have a

426
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,519
fever blister

427
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
is that their genes no they caught a bug

428
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,199
that's its

429
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
own microorganism and that's how it

430
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,440
works

431
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,920
i you know it's the thing is is that

432
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
but they'll tell you though that it's

433
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,480
your genes

434
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,560
so do priests as viruses can integrate

435
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,480
gray integrate

436
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:07,600
into your data no they can't

437
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,079
they can't so they can't mess with your

438
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,639
dna

439
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,560
they can't become your dna they can't

440
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,759
that's all theory and there's no science

441
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
behind that

442
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,240
there's no study that can actually show

443
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,839
that that's theoretical

444
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,240
but you know it's theoretical

445
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,320
theoretical

446
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,199
um that's how it works virus

447
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
is on its own you got the herpes simplex

448
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,120
one

449
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,560
and you got your fever blister and you

450
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
kiss somebody else and

451
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,560
then you give them your fever blister

452
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680
they just caught herpes simplex one

453
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,000
that's not your genes or dna that's you

454
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,120
catching the herpes simplex one a live

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,680
virus

456
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,160
it doesn't kind of get any more clear or

457
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
easy

458
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:54,240
breezy or understandable

459
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,480
okay um how did so many people get it

460
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
um all you gotta do is eat in a

461
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
restaurant

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
you just are the amount of

465
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,799
microorganisms

466
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,839
viruses like epstein-barr and strep and

467
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,799
shingles

468
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,839
you can get from restaurant eating is

469
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
unbelievable

470
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
unbelievable you've got chefs in a

471
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,120
kitchen with 100 degrees

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
their fingers

478
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
they constantly cut their fingers they

479
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
got band-aids all over their hands

480
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,039
as they're preparing your food that's

481
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,360
just one thing

482
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,799
you got public bathrooms public

483
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,000
bathrooms

484
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,000
if you go to bathroom and you don't

485
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,120
flush the toilet before you go

486
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
to bathroom because sitting on top of

487
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,200
that bowl is remnances

488
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,480
of somebody else and it splashes back in

489
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,160
you and then you can get it from

490
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
such relationships that's how everybody

493
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,120
spreads all the bugs

494
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
that's why it just goes around decades

495
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,240
of just spreading bugs it's just normal

496
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,880
life i mean normal life i'm not saying

497
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,120
1975. when multiple

515
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,200
children and young adults were

516
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,559
developing symptoms

517
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,960
which alerted doctors to launch an

518
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,720
investigation

519
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,320
in the area around lyme connecticut

um there's a lot of young people here

531
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
that don't know what a rotary phone is

532
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,760
or am i getting that old or what is it

533
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,919

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
going to get a rotary phone prop

536
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,720
i'm going to order one tonight that's

537
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
going to be good

that's gonna be fun i could do a tick

539
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,760
tock with that one

540

disease's theme if you guys just came on

559
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,400

rotary phones on the kitchen wall the

565
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,559
rotary phone was on the kitchen wall

566
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,760
this is important to know i'm trying to

567

568
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,039
why this is important okay and it's part

569
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,000
of why

570
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,720
everybody was so injured by treatment

571
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,280
for lyme

572
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
and how tens of thousands hundreds of

573
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,559
thousands of women

574
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
lost their health and their lives their

575
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,280
families fell apart

576
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,799
many died because of stupidity in the

577
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,159
medical system

578
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,919

hey terry just said no answering machine

607
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,600
either

608
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,880
right terry we the same age

609
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:27,679
or what nancy said i remember that

610
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,520
all that as a young child

611
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,280
all right kids were getting their

612
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,679
tonsils plugged out plucked out

613
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,840
as if they were apples on trees with no

614
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,799
understanding of the underlying cause of

615
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,120
tonsillitis

616
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,400
science research is so smart you guys

617
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
they don't even know what causes

618
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
tonsillitis and guess what

619
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,440
they still don't know what causes

620
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,440
tonsillitis and guess what

621
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,880
because medical medium tells people what

622
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,320
the cause of tonsillitis is

623
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,760
and puts it in the books medical

624
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
research and science are going to steal

625
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
that

626
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,280
next just like they stole all the other

627
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
information in here and started

628
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,520
publishing

629
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,840
with no studies behind it but started

630
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,840
publishing it after the fact

631
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,840
plagiarized plagiarity plagiarizing

632
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
if you're somebody who doubts medical

633
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
medium info and you're a big science

634
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
person you're all about science is

635
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
everything medical medium is crazy

636
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
well then this might give you some

637
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,720
relief to know that medical research and

638
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,480
science is

639
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,600
hijacking all of medical mediums books

640
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,360
and information stealing it out of there

641
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,760
yeah the medical means looking into it

642
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,799
because that's really screwed up they're

643
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,799
hijacking it

644
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,320
taking it and using it they're not

645
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,480
supposed to it's a pup this is

646
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
this is a publication that was before

647
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
all of their

648
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,200
them knowing all that even today there's

649
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,960
no clinical understanding of what's

650
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,240
behind tonsillitis they still don't know

651
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,320
what's behind tonsillitis

652
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
so smart my god they're so smart

653
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,880
while technology has made leaps and

654
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,200
bounds

655
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,760
yeah with phones and crap like that and

656
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
car like radios

657
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
technologies made leaps and bounds to

658
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,240
computers phones and car radios

659
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,640
that's it pretty much pretty much that's

660
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
it

661
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,559
think about that right but

662
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,159
the cars still have rubber tires we're

663
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,120
so advanced but all you got to do is run

664
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,679
over a nail

665
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,919
and your your ass is stuck on the side a

666
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,760
highway

667
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,279
we have so much technology now but we've

668
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,640
had a rubber tire since 1902

669
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,320
i'm trying to think about that one like

670
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,159
that that's a head scratcher to me we're

671
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,640
so advanced in technology

672
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
but we've had car tires since 1897 or

673
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,799
something like that but we

674
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,320
we still have a car tire which is a

675
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,440
rubber tire

676
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,039
with air filled in it since 1902 or what

677
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,960
is it 1904 i forget

678
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,799
1890 this is crazy right

679
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
so where's that advance we're advancing

680
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,120
car radios and

681
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,799
cell phones and and computers

682
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,400
while technology has made leaps and

683
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,679
bounds advancements in chronic and

684
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,000
mystery illness has been

685
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:02,400
at a freaking standstill

686
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,400
fibromyalgia still cause unknown they

687
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,919
think it's just overactive nerves

688
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,840
and if a functional medicine doctor

689
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,039
talks about pathogens it came from

690
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,559
medical medium books

691
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,080
and lectures the most advanced

692
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,720
information we have in chronic illness

693
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,679
comes from medical medium books only

694
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,440
you can have the best functional

695
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
medicine doctors practice in all their

696
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
stuff

697
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
the best naturopaths practicing all

698
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,640
their stuff and anything that they

699
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
that they talk about that's

700
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,480
microorganisms or comes back to anything

701
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,559
like viral or anything bacterial

702
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,480
comes only for medical medium books

703
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,320
before the medical medium books

704
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,520
and medical medium lectures and

705
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,840
everybody thought

706
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,320
candida was the cause of everything and

707
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,000
that was it

708
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,360
it's actually demented when you think

709
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
about it like why does it have to be

710
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,679
spirit of compassion that has to

711
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,400
solve medical mysteries why does it have

712
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,080
to be me at

713
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,760
four years old like you guys read in the

714
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,360
book i wake up one morning

715
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,880
and i'm hearing a voice perfectly clear

716
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,000
that's giving me all this information

717
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,159
like why does it have to go

718
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,799
that route and science research still

719
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,760
can't figure out why everybody's sick

720
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,200
that's why i wish it didn't have to go

721
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,679
that route because i would have had a

722
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,799
really

723
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,640
fun life or a peaceful life right

724
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,640
the symptoms that children and a few

725
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,440
adults in the lyme area started to

726
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,279
experience

727
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,200
chronic fatigue headaches joint pain and

728
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,520
so on were symptoms

729
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
that had been seen for decades in every

730
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,000
other town

731
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,039
in that state not to mention every state

732
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,600
throughout the entire country

733
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,320
so lyme disease symptoms were nothing

734
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
new

735
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,279
these symptoms children were

736
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,720
experiencing were nothing new it was

737
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,000
just that a few doctors had some

738
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
compassion and wanted to look

739
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,200
into it that's all it was they made a

740
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
few phone calls

741
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,279
yet somehow in this area around lyme the

742
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,120
illness was treated as something new and

743
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,640
unrecognizable even though everybody

744
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,200
around the world children were suffering

745
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,039
from this

746
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,960
for decades it's most likely because

747
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,240
compassionate doctors were trying to go

748
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,080
above and beyond their role

749
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,480
taking these symptoms more seriously on

750
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,400
a personal level

751
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,679
on a personal level doctors researchers

752
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,559
and townspeople began

753
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,120
looking for a culprit they went looking

754
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,840
for a culprit everybody

755
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,360
and landed on the deer tick they landed

756
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,240
on the deer tick

757
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,960
talk about lyme disease here they landed

758
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
on the deer tick

759
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
you guys just got on well i would i

760
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,360
would advise you guys to

761
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
recommend at least to watch it from the

762
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,720
beginning

763
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,679
later on so they landed on the deer tick

764
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
because one of the patients reported

765
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,399
seeing a

766
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:45,200
d a tick a few weeks before he fell

767
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:48,240
ill that's like a train derailing

768
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,320
the reasons unknown

769
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:56,720
and a passenger mentioning a deer

770
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
he saw grazing 50 miles back

771
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,840
the clues don't add up in either

772
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
scenario

773
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,640
even though no one could explain why a

774
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:15,520
tank would give someone lyme disease

775
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,520
a 17th century style witch hunt began

776
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,200
don't put those two words together

777
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,760
it'll it'll happen based only on a rumor

778
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,679
deer

779
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,200
ticks those two words

780
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,240
that lived on deer became the targets

781
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,240
so what happens you guys

782
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,960
what happens is the deer tick took the

783
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,080
blame

784
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,760
that's what happened it took

785
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,600
the blame right so

786
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,120
it's only because a deer tick

787
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:02,159
was seen a few weeks back

788
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:05,440
crawling on someone crawling on someone

789
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,320
and that is how it happened

790
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
okay nancy says oh my gosh so ridiculous

791
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,320
yeah so nuts right

792
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,559
so that's how it happened you're dying

793
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,559
here

794
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
so am i i'm laughing hard too the new

795
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,120
book is incredible

796
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,679
viola so you guys

797
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
that's how it happened so so when we go

798
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,200
back

799
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,240
into history into lime okay where it all

800
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,240
started

801
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
and you think about all the science and

802
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
research and technology

803
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
that we have in medical research and

804
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:41,039
science that we have

805
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:45,440
okay when you think about it

806
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:48,240
right really the conclusions were drawn

807
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,960
from symptoms children were having that

808
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
we're having

809
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,559
all around the world in places there

810
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,399
weren't even their ticks

811
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,559
or ticks of any kind not to mention

812
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,600
they only brought the deer tick in

813
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,520
because

814
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:09,600
one of the families saw a tick

815
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:12,399
crawling on someone weeks before

816
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,559
you see how how bad all this went how

817
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,399
terrible it all went

818
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,240
that's why research and science also

819
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,159
knows that i blew the ceiling off with

820
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,720
this one because millions

821
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,240
and millions of copies of this book sold

822
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
around the world

823
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
and doctors learned about it and they

824
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,600
realized

825
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,000
being sensible that research and science

826
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,399
and the

827
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,279
story and how it all happened with lot

828
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,880
in with

829
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,600
lyme disease was all bs yes people were

830
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,360
sick

831
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
yes they get sick with neurological

832
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,880
symptoms but it wasn't

833
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,880
really what it seemed to be

834
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,559
so patients reporting seeing a tick a

835
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,559
few weeks before

836
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,080
he fell ill that's like a train

837
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,559
derailing for reasons

838
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,960
unknown and a passenger mentioning a

839
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,039
deer ticky saw grazing 50 miles back

840
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,559
the clues don't add up in either

841
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:10,159
scenario like i told you guys

842
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,080
so in 1981

843
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,880
so you guys i'm gonna make a sell in a

844
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,320
minute you hang it in there

845
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,200
so i'm doing some reading for you guys

846
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,240
tonight i am i'm at your service

847
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,240

of course i want to be at your service

849
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,240
you guys always know that

850
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
in 1981 okay

851
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,360
all right a doctor announced he

852
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,360
discovered the missing link

853
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,600
a bacterium named borrelia

854
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,519
that the ticks passed along the humans

855
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,279
through their bites so

856
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,000
he thought he found something he thought

857
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,320
he found a bacteria

858
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,279
that must be passed from a tick to a

859
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,799
human right

860
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,480
1981. it's the missing link

861
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,200
okay he was lauded for his discovery

862
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,919
which led to a series of bacteria focus

863
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,200
tested treatments for lyme disease

864
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,399
it was the perfect out for medical

865
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,720
authorities

866
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,240
we solved your problem you guys your

867
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,600
problems solved

868
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,600
it's all solved it was a tick

869
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:29,840
bite that's what it was a tick bite

870
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:34,320
and we found the bacteria um

871
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,320
we everybody only had am radio

872
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,080
everybody had rotary phones on the wall

873
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,200
right no 9-1-1

874
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,840
probably didn't exist right

875
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,320
you had to call the town office to get

876
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,799
an emergency vehicle to your house

877
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,399
or you had to call the police department

878
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,919
number with your rotary phone

879
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,760
but they had the answers for lyme

880
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,760
disease just like they have them now

881
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
it was a perfect out for the medical

882
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,480
authorities no one liked ticks anyway

883
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,320
you guys like ticks

884
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,440
you guys like ticks crawling on you do

885
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,120
you guys like when you have a tick

886
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,720
crawling on you

887
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,000
i didn't like seeing those roaches run

888
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,440
across my counter did you see those

889
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
roaches run across my counter in the

890
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,159
tick tock video

891
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
i'm still still laughing here cracking

892
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,640
myself up no one likes take

893
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,600
ticks anyway and the theory of a

894
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,799
tick-borne

895
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,720
illness fed into the fear of nature

896
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,679
already present in society we hated

897
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,519
ticks everybody hates tickets

898
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,440
medical authorities felt they could give

899
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,880
up on digging for the answer all done

900
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,559
don't have to look for any answers

901
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,919
anymore we figured out it must have been

902
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,440
that little tick

903
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,600
that was you know found on that patient

904
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,440
weeks before they fell ill no other

905
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,399
ticks were found on anybody else but it

906
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,399
must have been that tick

907
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,679

unfortunately all these discoveries were

915
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,639
wrong

916
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,399

this is what you won't hear anywhere

918
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,599
else lyme disease is not

919
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,359
caused by ticks i broke

920
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,320

incredible what happened it freed so

922
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,399
many people

923
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,639
and lyme disease is not caused by

924
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,040
borrelia when the research was taken

925
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,040
place in the 1970s and 1980s you'd

926
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,359
suppose researchers would have realized

927
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,879
the problem was happening nationwide

928
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,639
and globally and today

929
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,159
you think someone would wake up and

930
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,760
realize that hundreds of thousands of

931
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,839
people who have never

932
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,639
been near a deer tick receive lyme

933
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,639
diagnoses

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,079
you guys are awesome let me get some

946
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,480
lettuce in this chopped salad so let me

947
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,359
just

948
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,359
put some lettuce down in here i mean

949
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,440
so i can just run by a couple little

950
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,160
things with you guys is here's what

951
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,200
happens

952
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,960
here's what happened with lyme disease

953
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,160
so because they thought it was bacteria

954
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,960
or it was on purpose to sell billions of

955
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,680
dollars of antibiotics

956
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,520
let's say trillions of dollars of

957
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,160
antibiotics let's just say that how

958
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,760
about that

959
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,640
trillions of dollars of antibiotics okay

960
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,640
let's just say that

961
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,760
worldwide worldwide worldwide right

962
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,760
so

963
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,599
and that's what happened there it was

964
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,520
about selling antibiotics because there

965
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
was no treatment for the disease or

966
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,480
condition there's no

967
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,320
there's no treatment now unless

968
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,079
someone's doing an epstein-barr protocol

969
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,960
for medical medium other than that it's

970
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,480
all guesswork

971
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,880
but they had to they had to

972
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,079
sell it because they needed they needed

973
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,400
to sell a drug

974
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,000
for this thing and so they had to say it

975
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,640
was bacterial and they had to say it was

976
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,800
a tick it was the perfect way out

977
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:41,839
it's the perfect way out so doing a chop

978
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,839
salad here

979
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,520
so what is behind lyme disease xena it's

980
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,160
a viral condition

981
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,800
viruses such as epstein-barr that cause

982
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,640
a lime

983
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,599
they release a neurotoxin that causes

984
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,599
neurological lyme

985
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,200
they release a neurotoxin that causes

986
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,200
neurological lyme disease

987
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,119
that neurotoxin affects the nerves

988
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
bacteria

989
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,320
can't create a neurotoxin and can't

990
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,680
cause neurological problems

991
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,160
but i can tell you right here the

992
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,400
history of lyme disease is grave

993
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,880
grave so many lives destroyed

994
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,920
see even some podcast doctors out there

995
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,000
and

996
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,960
health gurus out there that gave a lot

997
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,520
of antibiotics during the during the

998
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
90s

999
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,839
to their lyme patients put them in bed

1000
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,119
forever

1001
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:56,320
lyme disease okay

1002
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,320
if you want to say it's bacterial

1003
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,079
borrelia and bartonella are not super

1004
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,280
bugs you can kill them off with the

1005
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,839
mildness of

1006
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,599
antibiotics but what happens is the

1007
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,200
antibiotics makes lyme patients worse

1008
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,160
neurological line worse and worse and

1009
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,680
worse and worse

1010
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,960
unless you got a doctor now that gives

1011
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,480
you just a little bit of a mild

1012
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,240
antibiotic so they're not

1013
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,680
killing you with the antibiotics and

1014
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,960
then they're giving you cat's claw and

1015
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,000
all these other supplements

1016
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,520
like i've talked about um

1017
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,680
the cats call here like i've talked

1018
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,000
about not sponsored by the way

1019
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,359
the cat's claw from vimergy and i've

1020
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,079
been talking about cat's claw for

1021
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,960
decades

1022
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,240
and so now lyme doctors use cat's claw

1023
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,079
their integrative

1024
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,000
lyme doctors they use a little bit of

1025
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,920
antibiotics and they see that they see

1026
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
the patient get sicker and sicker and

1027
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,119
sicker from the antibiotics so they back

1028
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,400
down they get off the antibiotics real

1029
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,240
quick and then they start using cat's

1030
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,680
claw and natural subs and stuff it's all

1031
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
medical medium information they're using

1032
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,240
now

1033
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,320
but they do a blend so that people think

1034
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,839
they're not getting killed or

1035
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,920
literally losing their lives from their

1036
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,440
lyme treatment that that thank god

1037
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
that's what medical medium information

1038
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,839
did it's

1039
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
literally turned things around so people

1040
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,440
don't get killed off

1041
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,440
by their medical lime treatment

1042
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,680
making a chopped salad

1043
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,040
so we got the lettuce let's start

1044
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,520
chopping some other stuff you guys

1045
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,520
do red bell pepper let's do that

1046
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,720
red bell pepper i cut it at the top like

1047
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,640
that like you see

1048
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:28,079
i know i showed you these guys guys this

1049
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:31,520
100 times

1050
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,240
bartonilla barnella

1051
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,359
babesia borrelia get killed off easy

1052
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,160
with antibiotics

1053
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,880
they're not superbugs mrsa is a superbug

1054
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,000
and you can

1055
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,680
and the cure rate for mrsa

1056
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:50,240
is is incredible it's better than lime

1057
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,240
isn't that funny how's that possible

1058
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,720
because lyme disease is viral that's how

1059
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,880
it's possible

1060
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,240
and viruses create neurotoxins and make

1061
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,400
people really sick

1062
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560
viruses such as epstein-barr are the

1063
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,280
cause of lyme disease

1064
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,880
why do you think now right doctors have

1065
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,480
used so much medical medium information

1066
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,680
they now test for epstein-barr

1067
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,760
every time they actually work with

1068
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,599
somebody with lyme disease

1069
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,280
what why are you testing for

1070
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,560
epstein-barr no one gave a crap about

1071
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,839
epstein-barr before

1072
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,240
why are you testing for epstein-barr

1073
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,079
with everybody who has lyme disease

1074
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,680
like why are you doing that you're

1075
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,680
testing prep scene bar now

1076
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,520
everybody's testing for reactivated

1077
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,040
epsine bar you guys reactivated epsom

1078
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
bars medical medium information nobody

1079
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,599
knew it

1080
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,040
it reactivate it and now you can go to

1081
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,560
your doctor and they'll test you for

1082
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,960
reactivated epstein-barr

1083
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,839
and just so you know the reactive babies

1084
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,839
medical medium information

1085
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,640
35 years a lot of work

1086
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,319
but remember i'm 28 years old

1087
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,920
they're always writing all the articles

1088
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
and

1089
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,040
and hit pieces on me and everything else

1090
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
and the internet everything

1091
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,640
everything everybody has all the

1092
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,599
information right

1093
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,599
i have it all wrong

1094
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,200
morgellons i'm going to talk about more

1095
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,640
gel in some day you know what i'll do a

1096
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,640
podcast over jones okay

1097
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,560
how about that i'll do a podcast on more

1098
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,079
jealous i'm gonna cut up some tomatoes

1099
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,480
right here you guys let's cut these up

1100
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,480
real quick

1101
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,160
you can get an infection from a tick

1102
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,160
bite

1103
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,839
you can get a bad rash from a staph

1104
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,560
infection from a

1105
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,640
tick bite because the tick can leave a

1106
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,680
little particle of its body inside your

1107
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,079
arm

1108
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,079
okay that little particle is either the

1109
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,720
tip of the tick the head

1110
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,200
if it's not totally taken out all right

1111
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,079
or

1112
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,880
a leg of the tick can be left in your

1113
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,440
arm

1114
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,280
when a foreign body is inside your body

1115
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,800
you will start to get an infection and

1116
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,240
you'll get an infection on your arm and

1117
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,880
that infection will

1118
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,520
turn into a really nice staph infection

1119
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
right there

1120
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,839
and yeah if you need an antibiotic for

1121
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,839
that i i'm totally on board

1122
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,839
totally on board but that's not lyme

1123
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,839
disease

1124
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
can i talk about collagen

1125
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,200
absolutely you can't build your collagen

1126
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,560
by taking a collagen supplement

1127
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,599

you have medical medium information

1138
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,000

1139
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,839
collagen

1140
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,839
wild blueberries that's the way to build

1141
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
collagen

1142
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,920
trace minerals it's a way to build

1143
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,359
collagen

1144
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,040

your age

1151
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,280

1152
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,119
caffeine products going

sunspots make sure you have a lot of

1157
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,319
chocolate because the caffeine and the

1163
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,040
caffeine coffee products

1170
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,720
which makes it even worse because it's

1171
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,800
more caffeine

1172
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,200

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,160
another thing that hurts your collagen

1175
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:25,599
is viruses

dermatoxins epstein-barr

1178
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,760

and i got some butter leaf lettuce

1188
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,000
sugar selena what about it

1189
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,960
talking about processed sugar i don't

1190
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,440
think anybody should be unprocessed

1191
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,359
sugar

1192
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,040
but sugar is not the problem that's not

1193
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,560
why people are sick

1194
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,119
sugar's not white people are sick that's

1195
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,160
a cucumber you guys

1196
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,359
cucumber so sugar is not why people

1197
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,040
are sick it's fat that's why people are

1198
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,040
sick it's fat

1199
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,280
so that's why people get sick all the

1200
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,480
fat in their diet

1201
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,760
but i don't think anybody should be on

1202
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,280
processed sugar i don't think that's

1203
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,880
good xenon looks good

1204
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,280
on facebook how you guys doing on

1205
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,280
youtube

1206
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,440
is technology working out okay tonight

1207
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,440
you guys see me

1208
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,760
i'm skinning this uh cucumber down a

1209
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,760
little bit

1210
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,560
so what what really hurts collagen is

1211
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,720
all the cookies and cakes and

1212
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,079
even vegan cookies just fat anything

1213
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,160
that's fat

1214
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,920
lots of fat and diets you know i'm gonna

1215
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,760
have avocado tonight though

1216
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,680
but you can overdo it you can eat too

1217
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,599
much avocado because it's not avocado

1218
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,599
really that's the biggest problem it's

1219
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,920
avocados plus too many nut butters plus

1220
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,000
too many oils plus milk cheese butter

1221
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,839
plus chocolate it's all the fat

1222
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,200
and then then things are getting really

1223
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:12,880
out of control and then now your diet's

1224
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,400
just fat every day it's like oh my fat i

1225
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,440
had fat for breakfast i had peanut

1226
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,319

1227
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,960
i had peanut butter on my uh acai bowl i

1228
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,599

1229
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,520
chocolate on my oatmeal i had chocolate

1230
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,640
cacao nibs on my oatmeal i'm having all

1231
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,520
that fat

1232
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,760
um i had oil on my salad i had eggs in

1233
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,400
my salad i had tuna in my salads fat fat

1234
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,000
fat

1235
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,520
we fat ourselves to death that's what we

1236
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,800
do it's constantly it's all the time

1237
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,880
just lots of fat then

1238
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,960
i'm gonna have some bacon too or maybe

1239
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,960
pasta with oil maybe cheese

1240
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,000
cheese is fat it's just non-stop it's

1241
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,000
just constantly fat

1242
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,440
everybody's fatting themselves to death

1243
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,400
and then it builds up in the heart is

1244
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,760
what it does

1245
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,119
it always builds up in the heart later

1246
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,599
on i don't care who you are yeah you

1247
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,280
could live older and not have it

1248
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,960
take you down but you can also have it

1249
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,000
take you down to 50 years old you're on

1250
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,760
your treadmill at 50 years

1251
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,160
old you drop dead happens all the time

1252
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,319
out there you know

1253
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,280
and that fat just builds up and builds

1254
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,800
up and builds up

1255
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,400
and it gets inside your heart gets

1256
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,240
inside the valves gets inside the veins

1257
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,400
and the fat just builds up and builds up

1258
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,079
and that's a problem all on its own so

1259
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,520
it's not sugar's not the problem sugar

1260
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,160
doesn't build up in your arteries and

1261
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,760
your veins

1262
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,040
sugar can't build up in your arteries

1263
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,160

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,079
seatbelts i know some of you already

1311
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,520
know i've been talking about it already

1312
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,559
but just

1313
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,160
you might need to sit down for this i

1314
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,079
might need to sit down

1315
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,880
so when you get your blood drawn the

1316
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,960
doctor's office

1317
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,200
or at a place you get your blood drawn

1318
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,520
or phlebotomist comes to your home some

1319
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,119
people get that done that way

1320
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,240
um what happens is as they're drawing

1321
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,920
your blood

1322
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,079
they're removing something from you

1323
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,720
that's really important

1324
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,680
that shouldn't be removed from you so

1325
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,920
and what they're removing from you

1326
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,839
is your white count and everybody needs

1327
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,720
their white count desperately right now

1328
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:05,119
especially now you guys know why

1329
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,160
especially now you need your white count

1330
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,319
especially now

1331
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,319
so every time you get the blood draw

1332
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,680
they take way too much blood than they

1333
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,839
should

1334
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,440
and they keep on doing it they keep on

1335
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,480
doing so when you go back they do it

1336
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,079
again when you go back

1337
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,680
they do it again or the doctor orders

1338
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,280
for more tests and you do it again

1339
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,720
if you're chronically ill or chronically

1340
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,400
sick

1341
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,000
you're gonna get blood drawn from

1342
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,119
another specialist or somebody

1343
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,960
else but they'll take four vials full

1344
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,680
vials they'll take five full vials six

1345
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,160
or seven

1346
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,200
pretty much on any given day it's six or

1347
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,240
seven

1348
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,000
sometimes it's ten and in your blood

1349
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,440
is your weight count there's your white

1350
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,599
blood cell right there

1351
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,440
there's your red blood cell right there

1352
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:49,520
yeah your cbc

1353
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:53,359
your cbc your cbc see you later

1354
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,960
out the door see you cbc bye cbc

1355
00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:00,079
yep six files seven files bye cbc see

1356
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,079
you later cbc

1357
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:08,160
um whoa a white blood cell on top of red

1358
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,640
red blood cell going out going out now

1359
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,359
see you later

1360
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,319
and what happens is when you lose your

1361
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:17,119
white blood

1362
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,800
count your red blood cells they take a

1363
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,240
long time to come back

1364
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,920
so after they take your blood it takes

1365
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,319
easy 12 weeks for your red count to come

1366
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,720
back

1367
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,520
your red blood cells will come back you

1368
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,800
leave

1369
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,079
the doctor's office empty empty

1370
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
you're still walking you're still

1371
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,720
talking they give you some apple

1372
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
juice maybe maybe they give you a cookie

1373
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,880
and

1374
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,599
you leave you know they might take 10 14

1375
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,720
vials out they might take 18 vials out

1376
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,400
but you end up losing your immune system

1377
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,079
so if you've got chronic illness of any

1378
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,359
kind

1379
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,440
you end up you end up

1380
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:58,480
losing precious reserves precious

1381
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,760
reserves you need

1382
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,640
there's a reason so i'm in the lyme

1383
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,040
disease section

1384
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,880
which is also a trigger section which is

1385
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,319
interesting

1386
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,359
triggers to lyme disease and really

1387
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,640
triggers to a lot of different

1388
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,880
conditions right

1389
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,000
so extensive blood draw when a larger

1390
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,200
number

1391
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,200
of blood vials are drawn

1392
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,800
it can be stressful on the immune system

1393
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,640
because the very immune

1394
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,720
system the very immune defenses that are

1395
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,400
keeping the viruses behind

1396
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,880
lyme symptoms fibromyalgia hashimoto's

1397
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:37,280
any kind of chronic fatigue syndrome ra

1398
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,240
lupus whatever it is

1399
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,480
the very immune system that's keeping

1400
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,119
the viruses behind that are keeping them

1401
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,640
at bay end up being drawn out of the

1402
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,680
body so your

1403
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,200
white count gets drawn out of the body

1404
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,200
when your blood is taken large blood

1405
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,359
draws tend to take away a substantial

1406
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,920
portion of a person's immune system that

1407
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,200
day

1408
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,079
and it sometimes takes weeks

1409
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,960
to rebuild these portions of the immune

1410
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,040
system

1411
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,480
within those weeks that the full power

1412
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,240
of your immune system is not present

1413
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,359
anymore to monitor your blood

1414
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,960
you don't have your white count

1415
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,599
monitoring your blood like it should

1416
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,960
it's not

1417
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:20,880
it's not present viruses can get

1418
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:23,200
a window to strengthen and proliferate

1419
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,960
infections can travel from organ organ

1420
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,119
with ease because there's no account to

1421
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,880
protect you

1422
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,640
because they're not being corralled by

1423
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,160
your white blood cells it could lead to

1424
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,400
flare-up symptoms

1425
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,280
more fatigue more problems whether a

1426
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,760
week later

1427
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,160
a few weeks later or months later i

1428
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,880
recommend doing smaller blood draws

1429
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,440
over more visits i recommend doing

1430
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,920
smaller

1431
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,520
blood draws over the more visits

1432
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,599
if you're struggling with lyme symptoms

1433
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,400
or any other condition

1434
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,280
labeled autoimmune so important you guys

1435
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,000
so important

1436
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,200
i recommend no more than four vials of

1437
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,960
blood

1438
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:06,079
at a time and even consider

1439
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,040
fewer if it was me i wouldn't even do

1440
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,359
four

1441
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,200
if you're strong and you feel good maybe

1442
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,440
you can do four

1443
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,760
a mistake made by well-meaning doctors

1444
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,000
is to draw a large number of blood vials

1445
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:21,040
with sensitive people

1446
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,640
and i recommend if you're sensitive

1447
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:26,800
to do less so

1448
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,800
why is this important because it could

1449
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,800
take you down

1450
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,640
one of the greatest holes in the medical

1451
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,359
system right now which i had to drop the

1452
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,760
bomb

1453
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,520
i had to let everybody know because it

1454
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,319
always starts with medical medium

1455
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,520
with the you know these incredible

1456
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,119
pieces of information

1457
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,280
and it's not me in the end it comes from

1458
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,440
my source is that

1459
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,359
there's a serious serious crime

1460
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,920
happening

1461
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,839
and it's a crime of bloodletting where

1462
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,359
people are losing their immune systems

1463
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,880
to all these blood draws

1464
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,359
and if you're sick with chronic illness

1465
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,480
and you get five six seven vials taken

1466
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,480
away from you

1467
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,160
and your immune system leaves and then

1468
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,680
your viral issues creep up and you're

1469
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,280
getting sicker then guess what the

1470
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,960
doctor wants you back into the office

1471
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,640
for another blood draw and now it's

1472
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,119
another seven eight vials

1473
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,200
and then as you get sicker again the

1474
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,400
specialist that he recommends for you to

1475
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,839
go see wants a whole new blood panel

1476
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,599
and they want to see your metabolic

1477
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:22,880
panel they want to see your you know

1478
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,680
hormone panel they want to see

1479
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,920
everything

1480
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,200
and now they want to see a cbc they want

1481
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,640
to see all of it and now you're getting

1482
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,839
a whole nother round of blood work done

1483
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,240
and then you never get out of your

1484
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:37,520
sickness

1485
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:40,079
they keep you in your sickness for years

1486
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,440
and years and years

1487
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,480
that's how it works lisa says what about

1488
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,599
donating blood for blood drives

1489
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,240
probably the most dangerous what i would

1490
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,599
say is

1491
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,480
if you're donating blood for blood

1492
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,480
drives see if you can talk to them about

1493
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,480
donating less at the time and going back

1494
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
again if you really want to that's

1495
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,160
something you want to do i'm not saying

1496
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,520
people shouldn't donate blood we need

1497
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,839
we need blood donations but if you're

1498
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,480
sick with chronic illness

1499
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,760
the person who there should be some some

1500
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,200
system changes where

1501
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,040
people who donate blood should be the

1502
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,400
people who aren't dealing with any

1503
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,720
chronic illness you're not dealing with

1504
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,200
an

1505
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:22,240
autoimmune label no one with autoimmune

1506
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
should be donating blood

1507
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,000
but people without the autoimmune label

1508
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,079
they can donate blood they should be the

1509
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,319
ones donating blood so people who

1510
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,760
you know are at the top of their game

1511
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,960
they're in good health they don't seem

1512
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,480
to have any problems they're not

1513
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,760
diagnosed with autoimmune they should be

1514
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,799
donating the blood

1515
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:42,559
if you know if they choose to

1516
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:45,520
but you know took 30

1517
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:48,240
30 bikes bikes at a time you mean 30

1518
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,520
vials at a time

1519
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:55,280
30 biles at a time so

1520
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,079
what happens is that um we lose all our

1521
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,079
blood

1522
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,200
and then that's a scary thing so it's a

1523
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,760
hole in the system

1524
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,640
a really bad hole in the system where's

1525
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,160
your blood going

1526
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,319
because here's the problem they only use

1527
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:09,359
this much so

1528
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,359
they only use

1529
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,319
that much they throw your whole violent

1530
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,160
blood away

1531
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,720
what i recommend is asking for half

1532
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,760
vials that's what i recommend

1533
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,599
asking for half files ask your doctor

1534
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,960
can you do half files we're going to

1535
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,119
take about seven vials

1536
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:32,000
of blood can you do seven half vials

1537
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,960
which will end up being around what

1538
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,280
three and a half full vials

1539
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,880
i would want to keep it if it was me to

1540
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,480
two to three vials so you tell the

1541
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,520
doctor it's either two to three whole

1542
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,559
vials

1543
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,520
or two to three half vials one or the

1544
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,160
other

1545
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,000
now the nurse or the doctor might say

1546
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,599
well the blood lab won't receive it or

1547
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,640
accept it that's not true the blood lab

1548
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,319
will accept it

1549
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,680
the doctor just has to send it as half

1550
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,760
files and the blood lab takes it and

1551
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,599
uses it because the blood lab knows

1552
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,559
they only use that much

1553
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,559
they only use that much

1554
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,319
they throw all your blood away that's

1555
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,280
what they do

1556
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,440
it's probably the most dangerous

1557
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,599
negligent

1558
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:23,680
unreasonable deceiving

1559
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,640
disturbing broken part of our system

1560
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,040
and when we're dealing with times like

1561
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,640
these

1562
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,160
on top of it and we're dealing with the

1563
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,520
fact that chronic illness is on the rise

1564
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,359
to such a degree

1565
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,559
it's critical to know how it works and

1566
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,319
now i'm not giving you all the

1567
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,280
information on blood draw

1568
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:40,400
i'm doing a podcast pretty soon i'm

1569
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,319
hoping next week

1570
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,839
it comes out is what i'm hoping i'm

1571
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,520
doing a podcast on this

1572
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,119
and the information is going to blow

1573
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,640
your mind wide open it's medical meeting

1574
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,079
podcast at apple podcast i'm just

1575
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,319
preparing you guys now

1576
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,920
that medical medium podcast at apple

1577
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,240
podcast that's the uncensored version

1578
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,760
because

1579
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,359
if you hear it anywhere else at any

1580
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,119
other platform it's not going to be

1581
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,000
it's going to be censored even though

1582
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,599
you're hearing it it's going to be

1583
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,599
missing pieces i'm letting you guys know

1584
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,920
and they take crazy amounts of blood

1585
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:12,960
from pregnant women can you imagine

1586
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:15,200
how hard that is on the baby

1587
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,440
it's just unbelievable and they take

1588
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,200
crazy amounts for people who have cancer

1589
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,960
so when you have cancer you desperately

1590
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,119
need your immune cells you need your

1591
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,760
white count when you have cancer

1592
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,359
and they take all they take your blood

1593
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,880
they take your blood they take your

1594
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:30,400
blood and they take your blood and you

1595
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,400
don't even have an immune system because

1596
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,480
they're taking so much blood

1597
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,440
you ever you know come across somebody

1598
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,280
that's

1599
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,760
has cancer i mean they're taking all

1600
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,760
their blood

1601
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,160
and they're not using it they're

1602
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,599
throwing it all away

1603
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,040
they don't even tell you why don't we

1604
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,640
just take a quarter of a vial or a half

1605
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,079
file or do a real tiny tube and take

1606
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,359
half file they're throwing every bit of

1607
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,799
it away except for

1608
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,799
the smallest percentage there is

1609
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,440
you know what they used to do years ago

1610
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,200
i'll just cover this for a couple of

1611
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,799
minutes you guys they used to bloodlet

1612
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,480
everybody right when you got sick they

1613
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,079
would cut your arm open you bled in a

1614
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,680
pan and then if you didn't recover they

1615
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,200
cut you again if you didn't recover they

1616
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,880
cut you again if you got sick or from

1617
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,359
bleeding in a pan they cut you again cut

1618
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,680
you again

1619
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,119
cut you again and then you're dead they

1620
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,799
didn't stop bloodletting it's still

1621
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,599
happening now but it's under everybody's

1622
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,200
noses

1623
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,880
they completely fooled everybody every

1624
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,640
doctor every nurse they fooled everybody

1625
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,359
in the system and they fooled all of you

1626
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,760
everybody's fooled i had to drop the

1627
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,680
bomb

1628
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,839
i'm the only one to do it but i had to

1629
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,839
do it

1630
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,480
i'm gonna put some green onion on the

1631
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,480
salad

1632
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,960
i'm not saying don't get your blood

1633
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,559
working don't see your doctor i'm pro

1634
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,280
doctors i talk to doctors every single

1635
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,720
day

1636
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,880
i've helped doctors all through the last

1637
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,880
30 35 years with their patients

1638
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,480
i was known as the bizarre symptom guy

1639
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,040
doctor sent people to me

1640
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,280
to try to find answers because i was the

1641
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,720
detective of all detectives because a

1642
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,319
spirit of compassion

1643
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,760
and i would find out what's wrong with

1644
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,720
people i'm telling you that when you go

1645
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,760
get your blood

1646
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,680
drawn you got options you tell them to

1647
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,599
reschedule another appointment come back

1648
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,520
another day and get another two vials

1649
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,520
you keep your immune system so you don't

1650
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,319
lose it so you have a chance to heal and

1651
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,359
you don't

1652
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,839
lose your life lose your health or stay

1653
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,079
sick

1654
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:20,160
for 20 years as they do regular blood

1655
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,000
draws and you stay sick for 20 years

1656
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,520
because your immune system can't even

1657
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
work on cleaning things up so you can

1658
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,000
get better

1659
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,760
from your epstein-barr shingles hhv-6

1660
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
cytomegalovirus streptococcus bacteria e

1661
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,040
coli

1662
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:34,400
the staff and everything else all right

1663
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,240
let's put some avocado on this

1664
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,839
guys which avocado should i use did you

1665
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,760
ever come across that were you like you

1666
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:41,440
don't know which avocado you want to use

1667
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,599
is it this one or this one you know like

1668
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,880
some look better than the others

1669
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,640
meaning in a sense they look like they

1670
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,440
might be tastier

1671
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,480
i like the ones that are more firm this

1672
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,799
one feels a little

1673
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,839
softer i like avocados that are more

1674
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,839
firm that's what i like

1675
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,799
you guys you guys open avocados probably

1676
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,599
all the time right

1677
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:05,440
whoa that's a nice one whoa whoa whoa i

1678
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,640
like that

1679
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,640
you can squeeze that pit out that's

1680
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,160
an option you can do the knife trick

1681
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,000
trick right where you hit the knife into

1682
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,680
it and then you twist it like that

1683
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,920
but you can also squeeze the pit out

1684
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,599
right like this

1685
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,960
a lot of times it doesn't squeeze out so

1686
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,119
you end up crushing your whole

1687
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,400
half avocado so you didn't know you can

1688
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,160

1689
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,640
a fork you can use a fork to get it out

little dates on here

01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,839
takes years off your life is what it

1819
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,480
does the blood draws that are happening

1820
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:24,079
is taking years off of everybody's life

1821
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,680
you know those people that live to be 95

1822
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,880
years old nobody knows why or how or

1823
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,319
what one of the reasons is they didn't

1824
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,520
catch a lot of bugs

1825
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,760
had one of those lives where they didn't

1826
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,520
get a lot of different viruses bacteria

1827
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,559
the other reason

1828
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,319
is they didn't go to the doctor because

1829
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:39,839
they weren't getting sick to begin with

1830
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:41,760
to get them to the doctor

1831
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,200
they took less blood draws a lot you

1832
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,960
