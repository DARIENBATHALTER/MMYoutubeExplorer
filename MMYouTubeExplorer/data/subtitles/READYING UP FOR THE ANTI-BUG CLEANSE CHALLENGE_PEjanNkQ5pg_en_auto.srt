00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
into this let's talk about this a little

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
bit why anti bug plants what does it

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
even mean like

149
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
how does it work we got bugs that live

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,639
inside of us everybody is loaded with

151
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,960
bugs some people load it with more bugs

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,840
some people little less

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
and

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,840
there's four

155
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,639
actually yep four categories okay to

156
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,320
think about all right one category is

157
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,960
bug fuel

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,759
so we're eliminating

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
bug

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,639
fuel so we're eliminating a category of

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,160
foods

162
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,479
that feed the bugs so we're eliminating

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
bug fuel so that's one part that we're

164
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,280
gonna do

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,479
we're also eliminating blood thickeners

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,639
foods that thicken the blood when you

167
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,319
use foods that thicken the blood you

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,240
never cleanse you never detox you just

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
slowly kill your liver

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,560
you slowly kill yourself along the way

171
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,560
throughout your life

172
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,840
all those blood thickeners we're getting

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,479
rid of another category

174
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,319
dehydrator

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
not food dehydrators meaning like if you

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
got a dehydrator something like that you

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,880
want to make some crackers no no no

178
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,919
we're getting rid of a category of foods

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,639
that dehydrate the body dehydrate the

180
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,240
brain dehydrate the blood dehydrate the

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
organs right

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
and then we're getting rid of another

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,319
category of foods which are toxin

184
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,720
contributors

185
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,039
we're getting rid of the toxin

186
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
contributors so we're getting rid of the

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,120

foods are divided up by level with level

413
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,320
one being the most important to remove

414
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
through five

419
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,399
level one is going to be the easiest but

420
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,480
it's still going to be helpful and it's

421
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,199
still gonna be eliminating bugs you're

422
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,440
still gonna be starving bugs without

423
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,920
starving yourself okay

424
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,639

440
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,120
to you a little bit real quick if you

441
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,680
have a negative association

442
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,480
with removing foods from your diet

443
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,800
because of past diet protocols where

444
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
food was eliminated do any any of you

445
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,519
guys run into that do you have like a

446
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,759
negative association with removing foods

447
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
because of some kind of elimination diet

448
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,120
out there or some other kind of diet out

449
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
there right

450
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,279
where your food was eliminated for

451
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,040
example like food allergy diets or food

452
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,480
allergy testing

453
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,880
please know

454
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,639
that those were man made programs

455
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,079
gonna say it again

456
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,160
if you have a negative association with

457
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,040
removing foods from your diet

458
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
because of ptsd

459
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,079
from past

460
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,519
diets you've done

461
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,440
and cleanses

462
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,120
and food elimination

463
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,959
right please know that those were

464
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,160
man-made programs

465
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,560
man-made programs so important to know

466
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
their makers

467
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
their makers the men who made the

468
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
programs

469
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,399
their makers are unaware

470
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,240
of what causes chronic illnesses such as

471
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,439
autoimmune

472
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,600
okay and how food plays a role they were

473
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,079
unaware of that going all the way back

474
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,760
35 years of doing this that's any time

475
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,199
i've ever seen any kind of diet or

476
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,959
cleanse or anything

477
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,120
nobody was aware of what caused chronic

478
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,880
illness why somebody was sick with

479
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,039
autoimmune or chronic fatigue or

480
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,839
anything else but yet they were creating

481
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,679
these diets okay

482
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,400
so that's important to know

483
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,360
those are guessing games that we don't

484
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
play here so we don't play guessing

485
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,679
games

486
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
this is about knowing why you're

487
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,440
eliminating a food

488
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,400
what happens when you do

489
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,960
what bugs you're starving because of it

490
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,280
and how to heal like so many have healed

491
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
this is important so those are guessing

492
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,280
games out there that we don't play here

493
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,799
only here

494
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,120
only here will you find food empowerment

495
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,720
and the ability to take control of your

496
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
healing

497
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
take control of your healing process

498
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,520
using real knowledge okay i recommend

499
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
that you consider shifting your thinking

500
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,640
it's not that you're not allowed

501
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,760
to eat something i'm not gonna see and

502
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
actually you're not allowed to eat

503
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,320
something you're not allowed to eat

504
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,840
something okay you're allowed to eat

505
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,280
anything you want you you want to eat

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,400
something

507
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,000
yeah

508
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,360
look if you want to do this cleanse with

509
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
me and this is what you want to eat for

510
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,880
four days because that's what your free

511
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
will wants to do

512
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,919
and that's for some reason of what you

513
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
want to do

514
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120

522
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,039
choose not to eat the foods that will

523
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,200
feed the bugs like the cheese and gluten

524
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,490
pizza or anything i'm hoping that you

525
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,720

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,880
make informed decisions

557
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,240
so the list is in this book you can make

558
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,159
for informed decisions on what foods

559
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
that are getting in the way of your life

560
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,760
right

561
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,880
let's also be clear that none of the

562
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,799
foods here are listed as problematic out

563
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,840
of prejudiced

564
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,159
against a dietary belief system such as

565
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,480
veganism

566
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,799
plant-based

567
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,480
vegetarianism paleo philosophy or

568
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,799
ketogenic

569
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,159
theory

570
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,640
okay so this isn't about being biased to

571
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
ketogenic being biased to paleo being

572
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,760
biased to veganism being biased to

573
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,320
plant-based being bias to vegetarian

574
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,520
this isn't about that at all

575
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,960
okay

576
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,720
nor is this cleanse about

577
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,360

this is not a cleanse about

583
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
self-deprivation

584
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,880
starvation

585
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,039
or shame

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,120
this isn't about shame either i told you

587
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,760

right

598
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,600
the foods are listed solely because they

599
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,760
pose the risk

600
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,200
that you will not succeed with your

601
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,880
cleansing or healing process

602
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,799
that's what it is

603
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159

604
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,559

605
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
rundown on the medical medium

606
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,559
books here in this book

607
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
they got the street cred

609
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,120

water every day

674
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,919
you can sip coconut water make sure your

675
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,520
coconut water if you like coconut water

676
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,840
you don't have to sip or use coconut

677
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,919
water but if you are

678
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,640
make sure your coconut water is not red

679
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,679
make sure it's not pink

680
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,480
okay that's toxic coconut water

681
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,919
i know a trend passed around because the

682
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,679
coconut water industry didn't want to

683
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
lose millions and millions and millions

684
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,720
hundreds of millions of dollars over the

685
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,320
years so they convinced everybody they

686
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,120
lied

687
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,559
a zinger alert zinger alert

688
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,960
they lied

689
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,039
and they said that the pink red to pink

690
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,600
to darker red and the darker the color

691
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,120
of the coconut water going red

692
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,559
is actually good for you and that's the

693
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
best coconut water

694
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,320
that was a gross disgusting lie

695
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,600
the coconut water industry

696
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,760
i mean it's oxidated it's shot the

697
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,840
coconut water went bad

698
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
and that's what happens when it goes red

699
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,799
singer alert that's all that's what

700
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
happens when it goes red keep that in

701
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,360
mind

702
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,720
and what happens is when they're getting

703
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
all that coconut water shipped overseas

704
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
and it turned red

705
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,720
or it's turning red because it's getting

706
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
old they don't want to lose their shirts

707
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,960
so that red pink that pink to red

708
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,679
coconut water

709
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,919
is oxidative and gone bad and then they

710
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,840
sell it in the health food stores

711
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,279
pretending that that's the best stuff

712
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,840
that's how many tricks are out there of

713
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,600
the trade anyway use coconut water

714
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,840
that's not like that

715
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,559
keep that in mind so

716
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
zinger alert you're being screwed over

717
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,200
like

718
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
so many things happen in the alternative

719
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
movement non-stop

720
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,279

so you don't want to make that recipe

742
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,039
say you want to make a different recipe

743
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
you don't want to make the potato salad

744
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,919
tomorrow because i'm making that

745
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,039
tomorrow that's okay if you want to do a

746
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,640
different recipe totally on board okay

747
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
and say you don't want to do your

748
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
portobello stew

749
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,360
because you don't like portobello

750
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
mushrooms that's okay

751
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,880
maybe keep the portobello mushrooms out

752
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,400
or something make it the way you want to

753
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,799
make it right that's perfectly fine

754
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,720
so this is not a restricted diet you can

755
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,640
eat all day that's the cool thing you

756
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
want to make a big portobello stew and

757
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,559
you want to eat that all day long and

758
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
you can do that that's what's awesome

759
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,159
about that

760
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,960
and there's the portobello herb stuffed

761
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,320
peppers i'm making on the third day i

762
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,600
think i'm making that on the third day

763
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,559
yeah third day

764
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,399
right

765
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,240
so if for some reason you don't like

766
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,000
peppers you want to pick another recipe

767
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,520
inside the book pick another recipe in

768
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,399
the book but i'm hoping you make the fun

769
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,600
stuff with me right

770
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,520
so

771
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,440
let's talk about the levels that's the

772
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,840
next part so let's cover levels for a

773
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,960
little bit so this is fun

774
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,200
level one you want to keep out certain

775
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,120
foods okay

776
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,120
so let's bring in some foods in level

777
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,559
one level one

778
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,480
right

779
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,159
you want to keep these out

780
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,559
this is critical

781
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,279
this is bug fuel

782
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,520
i'm not ranking on eggs

783
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,440
eggs were a good survival food for years

784
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,240
and years and years out there

785
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
i was never anti-egg

786
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,320
but what happened was

787
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,320
classified medical research in science

788
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,000
before 1920

789
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,080
took the egg

790
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
and they learned they can grow pathogens

791
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,360
inside there because the eggs can eat

792
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,279
undeveloped protein from the egg so that

793
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,039
i mean the bugs can eat under

794
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,399
protein from the egg so they they

795
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,960
learned

796
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,679
that eggs feed all the bugs

797
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,320
and so they raised all the pathogens

798
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,919
the plague that everybody's freaking out

799
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,039
about right now

800
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,159
came from

801
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,159
eggs

802
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
meaning they were raised in eggs in the

803
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,520
labs

804
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,919
right so it's important to know so every

805
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,120
bug you deal with your simplex fever

806
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,120
blister

807
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,039
or your simplex 2

808
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,640
genital herpes or whatever you got going

809
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,919
on in your life that you want to clean

810
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,159
up and heal

811
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,279
or your mono or whatever it is

812
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,960
came originally grown out of eggs

813
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,039
from classified medical research in

814
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
science and then was released into the

815
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,559
public hiv

816
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
was grown out of eggs

817
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,320
and then released into the public person

818
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,399
purposely

819
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,000
so that people would get hiv

820
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
that's how classified medical research

821
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
and science does it

822
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
public medical research science doesn't

823
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,279
know this

824
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,000
so

825
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,200
you eat the eggs and every single bug in

826
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,720
your body

827
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,399
has a field day

828
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,960
and starts to eat

829
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,720
so we're taking away the eggs

830
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,440
that's on level one

831
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
so can you do it can you break away from

832
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
the eggs

833
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,679
can you break away from the bug feeders

834
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,640
right there so that's one

835
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,080
another thing too now level one in level

836
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,880
one right here says dairy products

837
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,520
so

838
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,600
can you get rid of the stick of butter

839
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,120
can you get rid of the cheese

840
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,559
can you get rid of the cheese sticks

841
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,480
right can you get rid of any kind of

842
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,640
cheese

843
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,559
cheese will feed the bugs too

844
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
can you get rid of the milk cheese and

845
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,480
the butter so that's one thing right

846
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,000
there to get rid of

847
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
okay

848
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,399
gluten that's the next one so let's get

849
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,720
rid of gluten right so we've got a slice

850
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,640
of bread right here

851
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
got a slice of bread can you get rid of

852
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
the bread

853
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,640
now that's not like straight white

854
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,120
processed flour bread but still

855
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,679
this was and it was toasted up with some

856
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,480
cheese inside right so can you get rid

857
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,840
of like the bread and the cheese

858
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,320
so this is level one level one also says

859
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,640
no soft drinks

860
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,640
no soft drinks on level one

861
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
so no soft drinks

862
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,080
right

863
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,360
that's important to know

864
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,600
no gluten which was the bread right the

865
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,960
wheat gluten so you can read the book

866
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,240
for more details but that's level one

867
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,679
and that's what i'm in right here

868
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,200
cleanse the heel

869
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
now maybe you're somebody that you just

870
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,240
wanna do level one

871
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,640
totally cool

872
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
totally cool happy you're here if you're

873
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
somebody that doesn't wanna do level one

874
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,240
and you just you just to have some

875
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,240
buttered toast and watch the gig i'm

876
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,799
happy you're here okay maybe you'll

877
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,360
learn some stuff it'll be fun right

878
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,080
let's go into level two so can you guys

879
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
do level two level two

880
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,840
is the same as level one you you get rid

881
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,919
of those first you get rid of the eggs

882
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,720
the milk the cheese the butter

883
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,799
gone but level two has additional foods

884
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,600
like pork

885
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,640
so that's when you get rid of the pork

886
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,720
so

887
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,279
you get the pork out of there that's a

888
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,279
big one too so that means like the bacon

889
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,440
the pork so i got some bacon on this

890
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,000
dish right here right so that's the

891
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,039
bacon so level two is getting rid of

892
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,039
pork now that's what we need to do

893
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,919
it's level two

894
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,799
okay

895
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,519
pork is a blood thickener i just showed

896
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,679
you

897
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,840
bug fuel right which is the eggs the

898
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,760
dairy the milk the cheese the butter

899
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,799
that's bug fuel

900
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,320
now i'm showing you blood thickeners

901
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,320
pork right

902
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,360
let's move to another one too so we're

903
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,200
in level two right the next one is tuna

904
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,880
so now we're talking about tuna so this

905
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,279
is sushi

906
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,159
so whether you open a can of tuna fish

907
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,640
or you open a pack of tuna

908
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,279
keeping tuna out is critical we're in

909
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,279
level two level two is not just eggs

910
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,000
dairy gluten milk cheese butter gluten

911
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,159
right and soft drinks level two

912
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,679
is pork

913
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,960
tuna

914
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,720
right

915
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,039
and corn

916
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,679
pork tuna and corn

917
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,440
that's level two

918
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,399
keeping those out so what happens if

919
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
you're gonna have corn tortillas

920
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,440
taco shells

921
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
made of corn

922
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
right

923
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,000
any kind of popcorn how many of you guys

924
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,760
are still like

925
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
cooking up and popping popcorn thinking

926
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,000
you guys are like in the safe zone

927
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,320
you're popping organic popcorn every

928
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,559
single night or on the weekends right

929
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,320
and you think you're in the safe zone oh

930
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,240
those feed bugs corn will feed the bugs

931
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,799
because it's it's all contaminated it's

932
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
all gmo and they use corn

933
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,440
right in the pharmaceutical world that's

934
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,320
how they make your drugs they use corn

935
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,640
to make all your drugs gmo corn they use

936
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,600
corn now also to still feed bugs in the

937
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,960
labs

938
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,120
okay

939
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,240
so we're level two

940
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,000
we will go into levels more tomorrow i'm

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,519
the preliminary to the cleanse it starts

948
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,000

950
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,200
so that was you my god doing all the

951
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,360
corn even organic corn even organic corn

952
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,159
it'll feed the bugs now what i've always

953
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,200
said with corn like organic corn if you

954
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,799
wanted to use it sparingly and carefully

955
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,399
throughout the summer or something

956
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,480
because you wanted you know to put some

957
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,520
corn in a dish you want to have that

958
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,679
roasted corn on the cob keep keep it

959
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,119
under control where you're just doing a

960
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,879
little here and there but if you're sick

961
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,560
with chronic illness like really sick

962
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,320
you've got something going on and you're

963
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,159
really struggling i would keep the corn

964
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,200
out all together because it could feed

965
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,760
the bugs even organic corn can so keep

966
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,919
that in mind i'm gonna make some

967
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,720
hot apple

968
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,879

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
so i got apple i'm gonna i got the apple

970
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,480
juice itself so you can go and pick up

971

an apple juice and organic apple juice

972
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,720

that if you need to it's perfectly fine

974
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,240
right as long as it does as long as it's

975
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,240
not like some apple juice it's got all

976
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,320
the citric acid in there or all these

977
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,240
natural flavors in there if it's just

978
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,079
pure straight

979
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,920
apple juice

980
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,839
you can use it if you want you can pour

981
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,079
it into your pot

982
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,160
you can make you can make your hot

983
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,079
spiced apple juice pour it into the pot

984
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,680
in the whole bit that's one option you

985
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,359
can also juice fresh apples too

986
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,200
so you can do that so i'm going to juice

987
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,079
a little bit of some fresh apples right

988
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,359
here

989
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,440
so i'm going to do that

990
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,800
and this is an option too you guys can

991
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,800
do which is perfectly fine

992
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,560
you just run some apples to the juicer

993
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,640
if you'd like

994
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,400
that's an option

995
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,800
just going to cut up some apple slices

996
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,800
right now

997
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,880
what i love about the anti-bug cleanse

998
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
is that it gets rid of bugs that control

999
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,920
your life

1000
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,599
because if you're sick and going to the

1001
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,000
doctor all the time and you're doing

1002
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,599
your doctor visits all the time and

1003
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,160
that's that's a big part of your life

1004
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,160
where you have to you have to make your

1005
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,079
doctor appointments okay i gotta go see

1006
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,599
this doctor about this skin problem now

1007
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,079
i have to see the doctor because i don't

1008
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,480
feel good now the doctors you know

1009
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,720
drawing all your blood and knocking down

1010
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,839
your immune system by drawing too much

1011
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,119
blood out of you you become like a slave

1012
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,440
to the industry a slave to

1013
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,720
what the bugs are doing inside of you

1014
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,839
you know like you're becoming a slave to

1015
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,359
to basically the world of bugs and the

1016
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,240
medical industry

1017
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,560
and

1018
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,640
that's not a like a great place to be

1019
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,680
that's not a fun place to be like i

1020
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,839
don't want to be um controlled by bugs

1021
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,560
and then controlled by big pharma too

1022
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,800
like who wants to be controlled by bugs

1023
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,359
and big pharma and here's the crazy

1024
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,440
thing big pharma the classified medical

1025
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,920
research and science part of big pharma

1026
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
is what made all the bugs so that's why

1027
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,160
you're sick to begin with you're sick

1028
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,839
because they made you sick and then they

1029
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,960
exposed you just like the hiv right

1030
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,599
you know the hiv they stuck all that hiv

1031
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,280
and all that blood that tainted blood

1032
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,520
and then they pumped it into people

1033
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,320
right that was one thing right there i

1034
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,560
mean

1035
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,000
you know they've actually spread hiv in

1036
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,880
a lot of different ways throughout the

1037
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,960
years purposely so that people would

1038
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,720
actually get sick right and they're

1039
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
doing they're doing it with every single

1040
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,280
thing with

1041
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,119
with the epstein bars

1042
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,480
i said once again i said in the past

1043
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,359
woodstock isn't is it how simplex and

1044
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,680
herpes got around it wasn't because of

1045
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,000
free sex and woodstock

1046
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,280
they put those bugs out there

1047
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
and

1048
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,400
they they put them out into the system

1049
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,760
they contaminated the system

1050
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,000
they actually infected people purposely

1051
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,720
that's what medical research and science

1052
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,680
did so keep that in mind of how it works

1053
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,599
so any reason why you're sick

1054
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,839
is because of that and then people yes

1055
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,560
people spread them of course but they

1056
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,720
knew that they knew people would spread

1057
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,520
the bugs they actually knew people would

1058
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,520
spread the bugs

1059
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,839
so it's like if you're if you're

1060
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,520
somebody who's living with a condition

1061
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,599
of any kind

1062
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,060
you're living with the bugs and if

1063
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,480
you're living with the bugs

1064
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,800
[Music]

1065
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,720
they're controlling a part of your life

1066
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,320
they're they're actually pushing you

1067
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,920
into

1068
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,599
they're pushing you into the doctor's

1069
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,079
offices you have to get prescriptions

1070
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,680
all the time right you got a thyroid

1071
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,359
problem and you have to live on thyroid

1072
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,359
medication well the bugs are doing that

1073
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,520
because the epstein bars is the whole

1074
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,920
reason for the thyroid problem you got

1075
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,560
hypothyroidism that's epstein-barr so

1076
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,200
why are we doing the anti-bug plants

1077
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,920
i think about it we're doing it so we

1078
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,400
can start knocking back the epscene bar

1079
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,200
knocking back the simplexes knocking

1080
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,960
back that shingles people think they

1081
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
skate free

1082
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,800
people think they skate free and they're

1083
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,280
going to be fine and then they have

1084
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,000
if you can like fast forward someone

1085
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,920
into the future like a healthy seemingly

1086
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,920
healthy 20 year old who's feels

1087
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,839
indestructible who has no problems if

1088
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,839
you can fast forward them to when

1089
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,280
they're 60 years old and they get a

1090
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,880
shingles breakout all through their

1091
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,920
mouth and throat and then want to kill

1092
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,520
themselves commit suicide

1093
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,200
it's happened you don't think the 60

1094
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,480
year olds or the 55 year olds to get

1095
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,480
shingles all through their mouth and

1096
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,079
their throat and the roof of their mouth

1097
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,160
you don't think they weren't they were

1098
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,000
20 at one point and weren't like

1099
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,920
exercising and playing sports and

1100
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
feeling indestructible and now they're

1101
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,359
54 years old shingles all down their

1102
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,480
throat and they want to die and they're

1103
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,320
on morphine in the hospital

1104
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,200
these bugs are in everybody and they

1105
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,220
come out and they come out in the most

1106
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,079
crazy ways

1107
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,200

1108
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,119
so

1109
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,040
medical medium information is

1110
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,400
reactivated epstein-barr if you heard of

1111
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,160
epstein-barr reactivated

1112
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,920
if you've heard that

1113
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,400
public medical research and science

1114
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,560
didn't know epstein-barr caused

1115
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,240
neurological symptoms and reactivated

1116
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,640
that's medical medium information so if

1117
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,400
you hear that from a podcast doctor it

1118
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,920
was taken from medical medium

1119
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,079
information

1120
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,680
because that's where it was first no one

1121
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,599
knew and it's years of teaching this and

1122
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,920
years of teaching doctors nobody knew

1123
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,839
any of that they didn't know that that's

1124
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,240
how it worked they didn't know

1125
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,839
uh epstein-barr reactivated they didn't

1126
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,000
know epstein barr

1127
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,240
had a second or third fourth life and

1128
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,040
reactivated over and over again

1129
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,680
they didn't know that epstein-barr

[Music]

1156
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,160
which i'm excited about now there's

1157
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
honey crisps out there right now you

1158
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,119

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,760
and like i said you can do bottle juice

1160
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,200
if you want to do an organic clean

1161
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,200
bottle juice

1162
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,160
you can do that like you know without

1163
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,240
citric acid put in there without natural

1164
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,720
flavors put in there so that's important

1165
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,640
to know what i like about the spicy hot

1166
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,920
apple juice it tastes so good it's

1167
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,400
insane

1168
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,400
you can use any kind of apples right

1169
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,240
you may not want to use green apples

1170
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,000
though so you may not want to use green

1171
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,359
apples green apples don't usually come

1172
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,800
out that great

1173
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,920

[Music]

1176
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
what i love about

1177
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,160
you can use any juicer you have what i

1178
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,839
love about this juicer is with food

1179
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,160
costs going up all it does is save you

1180
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,520
money which is incredible and really

1181
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,400
really

1182
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,720
like puts the pressure on whatever

1183
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,119
you're juicing so that you squeeze every

1184
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,720
last juice like drop a juice and that's

1185
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,240
what i love about it

1186
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,000

so i got some cinnamon sticks now you

1200
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,280

1201
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,280
can just use some cinnamon if you really

1202
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,440

to know that that's an option

1209
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,440
so

1210
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,560
it's a clean apple juice which you

1211
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,480

1212
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,720
got no you know citric acid always check

1213
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,240
is whatever apple juice you find make

1214
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,160
sure it's you know you do the organic

1215
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,920
apple juice and make sure it doesn't

1216
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,599

1217
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,040
just put some cinnamon sticks in there i

1218
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,280

okay i got this simmering

1235
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,160
so

1236
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,000
everybody has a bug in them

1237
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,400
whether they know it or they don't

1238
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,920
hepatitis c when you see people getting

1239
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,319
hepatitis c

1240
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,319
that's epstein-barr gone wrong so that's

1241
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,319
epsilon sitting in somebody's liver for

1242
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,280
so many years that they eventually get

1243
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,760
the hepatitis c diagnosis see

1244
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,640
so and if you got a reproductive system

1245
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,599
problem if you have endometriosis

1246
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,800
those are bugs if you have pcos that's

1247
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,599
the epstein bar which creates pcos

1248
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,240
so keep that in mind so can i use

1249
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,720

1250
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,280

eat them don't internalize

1279
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,480
those essential oils they aggravate

1280
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,400
the intestinal tract the central nervous

1281
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,640
system and when you're sensitive it

1282
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,720
could wreak such havoc i've seen people

1283
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,720
just in such bad shape from it so don't

1284
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,560
do that some people are so sensitive

1285
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,480
they're sensitive to even the smell of

1286
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,160
essential oils they're too strong for

1287
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
certain people to even smell them

1288
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,160
without getting headaches from it or

1289
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,720
getting aggravated by with anxiety

1290
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,560
problems getting worse essential oils

1291
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,640
are for people who

1292
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,880
have a very strong constitution who

1293
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,200
don't mind about strong smells they're

1294
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,880
their nerves aren't that sensitive or

1295
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,720
not sensitive at all

1296
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,480
and they can you know they can burn and

1297
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,560
they can diffuse them they can do they

1298
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
can do what they want with them but i

1299
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,319
still don't recommend taking them

1300
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:50,000
internally important on the central oil

1301
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,000
note really important information

1302
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,880
okay guys right now i'm just doing some

1303
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,119
hot apple cider

1304
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,359
actually it's hot apple juice and this

1305
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,000
is really amazing i got this in here

1306
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,319
i did some fresh apple juice in here i

1307
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,319
also want to show you that you can use

1308
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,400
the bottled apple juice too so i don't

1309
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:12,800
want you feeling stuck like you can't

1310
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,800
use the bottle you can all right

1311
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,720
so

1312
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,920
so i want you to make sure you're doing

1313
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,480
32 ounces of water or up to a liter of

1314
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,800
water a day i want that water intake

1315
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,640
herbal tea doesn't replace the water

1316
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,480
intake so if you're doing herbal tea

1317
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,440
right so if you're doing your herbal tea

1318
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,960
it doesn't replace the water intake

1319
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,920
keep that in mind during this cleanse

1320
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,000
right

1321
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,640
this cleanses in a deprivation cleanse

1322
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,079
so it's not about holding food back and

1323
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,720
starving

1324
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,359
it's not about going hungry

1325
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,240
really important to know okay

1326
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,240
so

1327
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,839
what you'll notice if you have questions

1328
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,319
like wait a minute what can i eat what

1329
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,640

1330
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,960
can't i eat

1331
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,880
when you look at the levels

1332
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,359
you'll instantly know

1333
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,440
because the levels tell you what you

1334
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,520
should choose to stay away from what you

1335
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,079
shouldn't eat right

1336
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,920
