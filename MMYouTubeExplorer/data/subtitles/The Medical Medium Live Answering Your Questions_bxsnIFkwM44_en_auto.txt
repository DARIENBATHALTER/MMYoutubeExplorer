[2.80 - 7.52] meditations

[25.76 - 28.80] have you guys been doing them
[28.84 - 31.84] um
[32.24 - 38.48] geneva says premenstrual syndrome
[36.24 - 39.36] yeah we what happens with that is
[38.48 - 42.40] because 80
[39.36 - 44.24] of the immune system goes to
[42.40 - 46.24] your reproductive system during your
[44.24 - 46.88] cycle and right before your cycle you
[46.24 - 48.56] start
[46.88 - 50.48] you start what happens with women is
[48.56 - 52.64] their immune system starts to
[50.48 - 54.08] to reduce everywhere else in the body
[52.64 - 54.96] and right when you're coming on to your
[54.08 - 56.24] cycle
[54.96 - 58.08] the immune system goes to the
[56.24 - 60.16] reproductive system
[58.08 - 61.20] and then all this pms happens and the
[60.16 - 63.36] pms could be
[61.20 - 64.48] anything because anything else you're
[63.36 - 68.16] struggling with
[64.48 - 71.20] anything it comes to surface
[68.16 - 74.64] and it comes to surface in a big way and
[71.20 - 77.84] then it gets blamed on the woman
[74.64 - 79.20] in so many ways like oh it's your pms oh
[77.84 - 82.08] it's just your pms
[79.20 - 83.68] your pmsing you know that's your problem
[82.08 - 85.04] that's your hormones you're hormonal
[83.68 - 86.72] you're just crazy
[85.04 - 88.08] you know that's what they did all these
[86.72 - 90.16] years they blamed it on the women it's
[88.08 - 92.32] just like oh it's your pms that's what
[90.16 - 94.32] it is but really that's not what it is
[92.32 - 95.52] there really is stuff going on like real
[94.32 - 96.96] things happening
[95.52 - 99.36] it's just and your immune system is
[96.96 - 102.56] going to your reproductive system
[99.36 - 104.16] and when it does that um
[102.56 - 105.76] everything else just comes out other
[104.16 - 108.08] problems that are really in there like
[105.76 - 111.12] adrenal imbalances
[108.08 - 114.56] digestive issues
[111.12 - 117.36] streptococcus you know acne can come out
[114.56 - 119.68] anything and when all you know just
[117.36 - 122.32] being real tired and you get cranky he's
[119.68 - 123.60] tired you don't feel good and that's
[122.32 - 125.36] what's really happening hey everybody

[158.00 - 160.00] here
[158.40 - 161.60] why don't we have more help to support
[160.00 - 164.24] our cycles
[161.60 - 166.72] um well that's the thing you know it's
[164.24 - 168.96] the the things that we deal with now
[166.72 - 170.00] in our life in the last 100 years didn't
[168.96 - 173.36] exist 200 years
[170.00 - 174.64] ago didn't exist 300 years ago and what
[173.36 - 177.76] people don't realize is
[174.64 - 181.52] chronic illness with women that's new
[177.76 - 185.12] yeah yeah there was disease sure
[181.52 - 185.52] but it but not what we have today as far
[185.12 - 188.72] as
[185.52 - 191.12] all of the path pathogen and heavy metal
[188.72 - 194.24] toxicity based conditions
[191.12 - 196.96] and other toxin based conditions and
[194.24 - 198.24] we never had all this and so women are
[196.96 - 200.08] up against things that
[198.24 - 201.92] weren't meant they weren't meant to be
[200.08 - 203.36] up against this wasn't supposed to
[201.92 - 207.04] happen in human nature
[203.36 - 208.64] but but you know evil evil evil people
[207.04 - 211.44] on this planet
[208.64 - 212.08] created a lot of bad situations and it
[211.44 - 214.88] fell upon
[212.08 - 216.48] women and men too it fell upon men too
[214.88 - 218.16] but it fell upon women and
[216.48 - 220.24] that's how this world's designed i mean
[218.16 - 221.36] this world is can be a really dark place
[220.24 - 224.48] i mean let's be
[221.36 - 228.00] let's be straight about that i mean you
[224.48 - 228.48] you gas and and murder six million jews
[228.00 - 230.16] yeah
[228.48 - 231.92] that think about and then genocide all
[230.16 - 233.60] around this planet in different ways and
[231.92 - 235.68] places and you think about that this
[233.60 - 237.44] place is a really dark place
[235.68 - 239.12] and yeah we could see the light in it
[237.44 - 241.04] and we can see the good in it too
[239.12 - 242.24] i mean the good that is here on earth
[241.04 - 245.04] but wow
[242.24 - 245.92] some bad stuff and from bad people and
[245.04 - 247.52] so
[245.92 - 249.04] and so yeah we're not supposed to have
[247.52 - 251.84] all these pathogens that
[249.04 - 253.60] medical research and science the private
[251.84 - 254.48] industry did and did you hear about that
[253.60 - 256.32] in my medical
[254.48 - 258.24] medical medium podcast at apple podcast

[261.52 - 266.64] what they did to our egg all of this and
[264.96 - 268.56] but yeah no we're adapting michelle
[266.64 - 270.56] we're i see your question there
[268.56 - 272.80] we're not adapting though we are we are
[270.56 - 274.88] we just have to use the tools to adapt
[272.80 - 277.44] we have to keep on using the tools to
[274.88 - 279.60] adapt and we can override these things
[277.44 - 281.28] we can get better we could rise above it
[279.60 - 282.72] absolutely so i don't want you thinking
[281.28 - 283.92] otherwise because you can get better

[389.36 - 393.20] yeah there's you can't speed up you have
[391.68 - 395.76] to be in just real time
[393.20 - 397.04] that's the only way the app works and i
[395.76 - 398.56] just want to let you know that that was
[397.04 - 400.40] in real time that was not sped up a
[398.56 - 402.96] little inside piece of information there
[400.40 - 404.80] lorraine l hey you're on here hi anthony

[416.08 - 421.36] food on they're gonna make my dinner
[418.24 - 423.28] and gonna answer questions thoroughly so
[421.36 - 423.68] you guys are doing the meditations i see
[423.28 - 425.44] that
[423.68 - 428.08] you guys are you guys are taking
[425.44 - 430.56] advantage of those free meditations
[428.08 - 432.40] um and i'm glad you guys you guys don't
[430.56 - 433.92] want me to charge for him or anything
[432.40 - 435.36] because i was asking you guys i think i
[433.92 - 437.28] was asking on tick tock
[435.36 - 438.64] i was asking do you guys want me to
[437.28 - 440.64] charge for those maybe
[438.64 - 441.76] that should that should that happen or
[440.64 - 444.56] it's like 500
[441.76 - 445.28] for a package of meditation so this way
[444.56 - 447.28] this way
[445.28 - 448.88] people feel like you know they they
[447.28 - 450.00] since they pay for it because that's the
[448.88 - 451.68] word out there in the street
[450.00 - 453.52] once you pay for something then people
[451.68 - 456.24] really take it seriously
[453.52 - 458.56] and um i don't believe that's true i
[456.24 - 460.32] think that i call bs on that
[458.56 - 462.24] i think if you make it free and it's a
[460.32 - 463.68] quality product actually a quality
[462.24 - 464.00] healing tool and practice somebody can
[463.68 - 465.84] get their
[464.00 - 467.20] life back i think people can recognize
[465.84 - 470.24] that i know you guys do
[467.20 - 471.04] um rachel brown says suggestions for
[470.24 - 473.84] healing with
[471.04 - 474.48] graves disease that's the epstein-barr
[473.84 - 478.40] okay
[474.48 - 480.48] so it's it's it's in order to get better
[478.40 - 482.56] it's important to in order to get better
[480.48 - 484.40] it's important to know
[482.56 - 486.16] like the information of why you're sick
[484.40 - 489.76] it's one thing to have graves
[486.16 - 492.16] but what is it um okay well
[489.76 - 494.08] you know you had you had a blood test
[492.16 - 495.68] the doctor says well you got a thyroid
[494.08 - 498.40] problem you got graves
[495.68 - 499.36] it's an autoimmune condition but where's
[498.40 - 501.44] the answer
[499.36 - 503.20] like i want to know where's the answer
[501.44 - 504.88] so if i had graves disease i want to
[503.20 - 507.44] know what that's going on like
[504.88 - 508.96] what's wrong like what what's happening
[507.44 - 511.68] does that mean my body's attacking
[508.96 - 513.68] itself what's going wrong and
[511.68 - 514.72] so that's what i would want and i would
[513.68 - 516.88] want an answer
[514.72 - 518.56] you get an answer and then you could
[516.88 - 519.84] really heal because then you know what
[518.56 - 522.32] you're doing you know where you're going
[519.84 - 524.80] and so i put information in here for
[522.32 - 525.76] hyperthyroid hypothyroid hypo hyperol
[524.80 - 527.76] that graves
[525.76 - 529.12] so it's in here so you know what's wrong
[527.76 - 531.20] and then some protocols you could take
[529.12 - 534.32] them to your doctor if you want to
[531.20 - 536.56] totally do that um says love the
