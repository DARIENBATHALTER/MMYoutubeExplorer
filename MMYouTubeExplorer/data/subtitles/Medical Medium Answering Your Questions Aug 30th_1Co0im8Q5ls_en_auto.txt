[14.92 - 19.76] and the celery juice though i'm working
[18.64 - 21.04] on that first
[19.76 - 22.88] so that's what i'm working on as we
[21.04 - 23.44] speak this is about 30 ounces of celery
[22.88 - 25.20] juice
[23.44 - 27.28] are you guys doing your celery juice
[25.20 - 29.20] it's an important tool therapeutic tool
[27.28 - 30.88] it's an herbal medicine
[29.20 - 33.04] and spirit of compassion told me about
[30.88 - 33.52] this long time ago when i was younger
[33.04 - 35.28] and
[33.52 - 37.28] just a great great tool it's helping so
[35.28 - 39.52] many people
[37.28 - 39.52] so

[45.44 - 50.32] barbara wonderful and um
[48.96 - 53.28] glad everybody's here because i want to
[50.32 - 56.32] answer questions
[53.28 - 58.48] so yeah there's there's a question there
[56.32 - 61.76] about mrsa too so i might have to
[58.48 - 63.04] talk about that in a little bit as well
[61.76 - 65.20] you know the thing is about with merce
[63.04 - 65.68] it's all about like getting immune
[65.20 - 67.84] system
[65.68 - 69.44] stronger getting your immerse is a bug
[67.84 - 70.40] and i talk about bugs it's all about
[69.44 - 72.56] bugs right
[70.40 - 74.00] and so when you look at cleanse of heal
[72.56 - 74.88] you see you know the anti-bug cleanse
[74.00 - 78.40] and everything else but
[74.88 - 79.44] bugs bugs have similar jobs their
[78.40 - 82.64] similar jobs
[79.44 - 86.40] is like bugs similar jobs is to
[82.64 - 89.44] feed off of food so
[86.40 - 91.36] bugs love food so bacteria whether it's
[89.44 - 93.20] super bacteria
[91.36 - 95.04] they love food so always they always
[93.20 - 95.60] realize they have to be eating something
[95.04 - 98.64] they like
[95.60 - 100.48] something that we have inside of us so
[98.64 - 101.68] a lot of doctors talk to me about mrsa
[100.48 - 102.80] it's something that comes up all the
[101.68 - 105.44] time
[102.80 - 105.84] and what i tell doctors is um because
[105.44 - 107.68] because
[105.84 - 109.44] you guys know i tell you this is i talk
[107.68 - 110.88] to a good two or three doctors a day
[109.44 - 112.48] every single day
[110.88 - 113.76] and they reach out they want to know
[112.48 - 115.44] information so they can help their
[113.76 - 118.16] patients out there in the world
[115.44 - 119.04] and um and what i've always asked about
[118.16 - 120.56] mercy like
[119.04 - 122.16] what do you you know what's your take on
[120.56 - 125.52] mercy and my take is
[122.16 - 126.64] getting foods out of you out of your
[125.52 - 129.60] diet that actually
[126.64 - 131.84] feed mrs that's one that's one edge you
[129.60 - 134.08] can try to get and i tell doctors so
[131.84 - 135.44] eggs you don't want to eat eggs because
[134.08 - 138.96] eggs were
[135.44 - 141.92] used to raise mrsa
[138.96 - 143.36] originally so mrsa wasn't this thing
[141.92 - 146.80] that just appeared
[143.36 - 148.48] like it appeared mrsa was in a lab
[146.80 - 150.48] along with all the other bugs a long
[148.48 - 154.32] time ago and somehow
[150.48 - 156.80] got out somehow escaped i don't know how
[154.32 - 158.16] but they did you know you can think of a
[156.80 - 158.72] lot of different ways they could have
[158.16 - 161.12] done it
[158.72 - 162.40] but it escaped and got on the scene and
[161.12 - 166.24] how was it raised it was
[162.40 - 168.40] raised in labs eating eggs so using eggs
[166.24 - 171.04] as the food so you got to remember that
[168.40 - 172.32] so if you're you know somebody that has
[171.04 - 173.68] that and you're dealing with that no
[172.32 - 174.48] eggs look out for that look out for
[173.68 - 177.12] gluten
[174.48 - 178.16] look out for different you know for um
[177.12 - 179.28] milk cheese and butter
[178.16 - 181.12] don't do anything like that that's
[179.28 - 182.00] really important to know and then it's
[181.12 - 184.00] about like
[182.00 - 185.20] if i had mrsa i'd want to make sure i
[184.00 - 187.04] had the right zinc
[185.20 - 189.28] because that's incredible for any kind
[187.04 - 190.40] of bug issue like in that or anything
[189.28 - 191.84] you know and i'll make sure i got the
[190.40 - 193.60] right zinc i make sure i know the right
[191.84 - 195.12] tools make sure i'm drinking my
[193.60 - 197.04] celery juice and someone might say oh
[195.12 - 198.88] he's saying celery just fixes everything
[197.04 - 200.72] no it's not it it's
[198.88 - 201.92] celery juice is really supportive for
[200.72 - 204.72] the immune system
[201.92 - 206.72] it also is anti-bug so it's all about
[204.72 - 208.88] how many tools can you bring in
[206.72 - 211.04] can you get rid of the eggs can you you
[208.88 - 212.48] know can you um
[211.04 - 214.56] you know it's all important you know
[212.48 - 216.24] it's all about that plus uh celery juice
[214.56 - 217.44] is bioavailable vitamin c it doesn't
[216.24 - 219.60] have to be converted
[217.44 - 221.20] so like the celery juice right here that
[219.60 - 221.52] doesn't have to be converted to vitamin
[221.20 - 224.24] c
[221.52 - 226.16] every single vitamin c you take and do
[224.24 - 228.56] has to be converted by your liver
[226.16 - 230.08] and celery juice is the only celery has
[228.56 - 231.84] the only vitamin c that doesn't have to
[230.08 - 233.60] be converted so it's all these little
[231.84 - 236.64] tools that count
[233.60 - 238.16] um so that when you're somewhere if
[236.64 - 239.60] you're visiting somebody in a hospital
[238.16 - 240.24] or whatever it is you end up getting
[239.60 - 242.56] mrsa
[240.24 - 243.60] or you could you can get it in a public
[242.56 - 246.72] bathroom
[243.60 - 248.72] and now you have mrsa and it's like
[246.72 - 250.16] yeah it's like what what kind of
[248.72 - 252.32] environment are you
[250.16 - 253.28] giving mrsa like what kind of
[252.32 - 255.68] environment is it
[253.28 - 256.32] allowed to take advantage of so it's all
[255.68 - 257.92] about
[256.32 - 259.20] the tools it's all about the zinc it's
[257.92 - 261.12] all about making sure you're not eating
[259.20 - 261.60] eggs it's all about keeping your fats
[261.12 - 264.32] low
[261.60 - 265.92] if your fats are too high then your
[264.32 - 267.44] immune system is going to struggle if
[265.92 - 268.96] your blood fat's high all the time
[267.44 - 271.52] you're eating too much
[268.96 - 272.96] avocado nuts and seeds you know almond
[271.52 - 276.48] butter peanut butter
[272.96 - 278.08] chicken meat fish whatever it is oils
[276.48 - 279.36] you know whatever you're doing if you're
[278.08 - 281.12] eating too much of that you're not
[279.36 - 283.20] eating enough leafy greens
[281.12 - 285.20] leafy greens are critical if you're not
[283.20 - 287.52] doing you know enough of that wild foods
[285.20 - 288.96] are you doing any well foods and so
[287.52 - 291.04] it's all this stuff medical medium
[288.96 - 292.24] information has all that information so
[291.04 - 297.84] and talks about that it's what it's
[292.24 - 302.48] always been so yeah
[297.84 - 304.80] so um delores super low b12
[302.48 - 306.24] getting weekly shots what can i do to
[304.80 - 308.40] naturally increase now what i tell
[306.24 - 309.92] doctors all the time i get asked that
[308.40 - 311.92] doctors contact me and say i heard
[309.92 - 313.60] anthony you don't like the b12 shots
[311.92 - 315.20] the doctors will ask me that i don't
[313.60 - 318.72] like the b12 shots
[315.20 - 320.56] um and i i like it orally
[318.72 - 322.32] so that's what i like using the b12 it
[320.56 - 324.48] has to be oral b12
[322.32 - 326.00] i mean my my whole opinion from what i
[324.48 - 326.88] get from spirit of compassion teaching
[326.00 - 328.48] me so then i've
[326.88 - 330.40] i'm obviously going with spirit of
[328.48 - 334.00] compassion's information so
[330.40 - 337.44] and i tell doctors to be 12 shots
[334.00 - 341.28] is that is it a shot is an actual shot
[337.44 - 343.68] versus in uh inter intravenous
[341.28 - 345.36] vitamin so that's different i mean you
[343.68 - 347.04] know i'm pro-intravenous vitamins and
[345.36 - 348.16] for some things and for some reasons and
[347.04 - 351.52] for some cases
[348.16 - 352.08] so i'm pro that but b12 shots i'm not
[351.52 - 354.08] pro
[352.08 - 355.44] so i'm not i'm never happy about b12
[354.08 - 357.20] shots so um
[355.44 - 359.04] you go to your doctor ask him say hey
[357.20 - 361.76] what about an oral b12
[359.04 - 362.88] i feel that when it goes or not feel i
[361.76 - 365.28] mean i've known through spirit of
[362.88 - 367.04] compassion and then i've seen it work
[365.28 - 368.40] when it goes through the digestive tract
[367.04 - 370.56] so when it goes into the mouth through
[368.40 - 372.40] the digestive tract it hits the ilium
[370.56 - 374.32] the ilium is where you produce your own
[372.40 - 375.84] b12 when it hits the ilium you're
[374.32 - 377.76] producing your own b12 there
[375.84 - 379.60] when you get a b12 shot it doesn't hit
[377.76 - 380.08] the helium and you want the b12
[379.60 - 381.68] eventually
[380.08 - 383.52] going down to the helium where you
[381.68 - 384.56] produce your own b12 and then it pulls
[383.52 - 386.88] up into the liver
[384.56 - 388.48] so when you take an oral b12 supplement
[386.88 - 389.84] it goes to this natural process
[388.48 - 391.92] it goes down to the ilium where you
[389.84 - 394.48] create b12 then it gets sucked up to the
[391.92 - 396.96] hepatoportal highway up into the liver
[394.48 - 398.48] and then the liver then converts it
[396.96 - 399.84] converts it better
[398.48 - 402.16] and when it converts it better it
[399.84 - 404.48] baptizes it sends it back out and that
[402.16 - 407.84] makes the b12 really work so
[404.48 - 410.48] um and if you're plant-based you're not
[407.84 - 412.32] b12 deficient because you're plant-based
[410.48 - 413.76] uh animal will be animal based people
[412.32 - 415.20] they're all b12 deficient
[413.76 - 418.72] just millions and millions of them
[415.20 - 421.28] millions so really important to know
[418.72 - 423.04] so but having a combination of adenosil
[421.28 - 425.36] cobalamin methocil cabal
[423.04 - 426.72] methylcobalamin adenosicobalam and it's
[425.36 - 429.36] really important you can check out my
[426.72 - 431.92] directory medicalminion.com

[513.04 - 516.16] find anywhere that's the one thing about
[514.64 - 518.08] the medical medium information it's all
[516.16 - 518.48] unique and original everything else is
[518.08 - 519.84] not
[518.48 - 521.36] so everything else floating around has
[519.84 - 522.96] been the same old for decade after
[521.36 - 525.92] decade with nobody getting better
[522.96 - 527.44] unless they take tidbits of original
[525.92 - 529.12] medical medium information
[527.44 - 530.56] and they do and they don't cite it back
[529.12 - 532.48] like a lot of different people all
[530.56 - 534.16] through the years 35 years of this
[532.48 - 535.92] have not cited it backs and then someone
[534.16 - 539.04] thinks it came from somewhere else
[535.92 - 539.84] um but what you'll find is copper inside
[539.04 - 543.84] the liver
[539.84 - 546.40] plus ebv equals eczema weeping eczema
[543.84 - 547.20] for sure all of it so you need a virus
[546.40 - 548.72] inside the liver
[547.20 - 550.56] and i teach doctors this all the time
[548.72 - 552.80] the virus inside the liver ebv
[550.56 - 554.00] it feeds off of copper releases a
[552.80 - 556.56] dermatoxin
[554.00 - 557.84] it craps out copper the virus actually
[556.56 - 559.44] craps out copper
[557.84 - 560.96] when it releases it goes to the bathroom
[559.44 - 563.12] and that copper comes out
[560.96 - 564.56] that becomes this dermatoxin and that
[563.12 - 566.00] floats around through the body and it
[564.56 - 567.84] surfaces through the skin because the
[566.00 - 569.84] liver is stagnant and sluggish
[567.84 - 570.88] and when that happens you end up getting
[569.84 - 572.80] your eczema so
[570.88 - 574.32] you'll learn here like what do i do
[572.80 - 576.32] you'll find out the true cause
[574.32 - 578.08] what do i do what kind of options do i
[576.32 - 579.36] have take this to your doctor ask him
[578.08 - 582.48] about it

[584.08 - 587.52] of healing that's the whole point you

[587.52 - 591.04] your own personal protocol with medical
[589.36 - 592.16] media information you can take it as far

[634.08 - 637.52] other people have known throughout the
[635.52 - 639.36] years is you you
[637.52 - 641.68] definitely get when it comes down to
[639.36 - 644.72] gestational diabetes
[641.68 - 646.00] ask around get second opinions get a
[644.72 - 648.00] third opinion
[646.00 - 649.92] get a fourth opinion and what you'll
[648.00 - 651.20] find is when you're getting different
[649.92 - 652.40] opinions you'll find that
[651.20 - 654.24] another doctor is going to be a lot
[652.40 - 655.44] helpful with that more helpful with that
[654.24 - 656.40] than another doctor that's what i've
[655.44 - 658.08] always known there's
[656.40 - 659.92] that that's where i would start is did
[658.08 - 661.52] you get a second third fourth opinion
[659.92 - 663.36] because when it comes down to that so
[661.52 - 665.36] important to get a consensus
[663.36 - 666.96] between doctors and are they talking to
[665.36 - 668.24] each other too like are the doctors
[666.96 - 669.92] talking to each other if you find they
[668.24 - 672.40] won't talk to each other
[669.92 - 673.84] and and you and that that that's really
[672.40 - 676.16] hard and i noticed that
[673.84 - 677.68] you know getting extra support because
[676.16 - 679.04] when doctors start talking to each other
[677.68 - 682.56] so then they can try to figure out a
[679.04 - 682.56] game plan and how to address it
[686.84 - 689.84] so
[694.72 - 699.04] it's a little dry tonight so i better
[696.32 - 699.04] sip some storage
[699.68 - 706.56] i've been talking all day so
[702.96 - 710.24] you know what a lot of times you'll hear
[706.56 - 710.24] you know one of the what the whole thing
[714.84 - 717.84] is
[722.96 - 726.64] looking for some questions here you guys

[731.60 - 735.36] so each other day 9 of the advanced 369
[734.56 - 737.60] cleanse
[735.36 - 738.72] the advanced 369 cleanse is in cleanse

[738.72 - 741.60] that's really helping so many people
[740.40 - 742.96] around the world right now it's an
[741.60 - 744.80] unbelievable cleanse
[742.96 - 746.32] just finished your eighth year so you're

[746.32 - 750.00] your second celery juice you're on round
[748.80 - 751.52] eight of 369.
[750.00 - 754.32] incredible i'm so proud of you it's
[751.52 - 759.20] amazing it's really amazing
[754.32 - 762.24] love you too erica
[759.20 - 763.36] karen r a rheumatoid arthritis so first
[762.24 - 765.12] thing you want to do is you want to know
[763.36 - 766.64] what causes it so that's the key go to
[765.12 - 768.08] the library
[766.64 - 769.68] don't even buy the book go to the
[768.08 - 771.28] library get it for free
[769.68 - 773.04] okay so then you can get the book and
[771.28 - 776.08] you can look at it and you can see
[773.04 - 778.32] like the cause of ra and you it's
[776.08 - 779.28] you can go to the autoimmune because ra
[778.32 - 781.12] is
[779.28 - 782.56] called autoimmune that's what the
[781.12 - 784.16] research and science calls it it's what
[782.56 - 786.56] doctors will call it it's autoimmune
[784.16 - 788.00] so if you go in here you'll find it
[786.56 - 790.16] either in the autoimmune section
[788.00 - 791.60] that will just be anything that's not
[790.16 - 793.20] listed in here that's autoimmune you go
[791.60 - 796.16] into the autoimmune section
[793.20 - 796.16] unless you find it
[799.12 - 802.64] sandra says you never answer questions
[801.92 - 805.36] you just say
[802.64 - 806.56] buy my book okay good question well
[805.36 - 808.40] don't buy the book
[806.56 - 810.08] get it free at the library that's number
[808.40 - 812.08] one so
[810.08 - 813.92] another thing too is i'm not just trying
[812.08 - 815.68] to sell a book if i wanted to do that i
[813.92 - 817.84] would sell programs
[815.68 - 819.20] and get rich you know by selling
[817.84 - 819.68] programs for five thousand dollars
[819.20 - 820.88] apiece
[819.68 - 822.64] twenty five hundred dollars a piece
[820.88 - 824.72] three thousand dollars a piece thousands
[822.64 - 827.36] of people would buy into the programs
[824.72 - 828.08] i can do courses and classes i don't and
[827.36 - 829.84] um
[828.08 - 831.84] it would be unbelievable really what
[829.84 - 833.76] would happen so i don't do that choose
[831.84 - 835.92] not to do that it's my publisher's book
[833.76 - 837.68] they sell it out there sure i'm trying
[835.92 - 839.92] to get the book out there too to help
[837.68 - 842.16] people so people have a resource
[839.92 - 843.36] but if i was all about just trying to
[842.16 - 845.92] sell something
[843.36 - 846.48] then i would be selling courses classes
[845.92 - 848.80] and
[846.48 - 850.64] um programs and selling them for
[848.80 - 852.00] thousands upon thousands of dollars
[850.64 - 853.28] i would break the book up so no one
[852.00 - 854.80] would get the information and they would
[853.28 - 856.24] have to pay for it but i want you to
[854.80 - 857.84] have the information for free
[856.24 - 860.00] so i'm here answering questions and
[857.84 - 862.48] telling you to go to the library
[860.00 - 863.92] um and what i'm doing is i'm answering
[862.48 - 865.28] questions as far as
[863.92 - 867.28] letting you know that you can find the
[865.28 - 868.64] causes to these conditions and i'm going
[867.28 - 869.52] to talk about food questions and other
[868.64 - 872.32] things too
[869.52 - 873.68] but the causes of these conditions so if
[872.32 - 874.56] you've got something going on you can
[873.68 - 878.32] learn the cause
[874.56 - 878.32] and that's that's really important
[878.56 - 884.00] it's so you know what to do it's like um
[882.48 - 886.32] all the information's in this book if i
[884.00 - 888.40] sit here i can blow an hour away
[886.32 - 890.24] just on one thing by how much
[888.40 - 892.40] information i can talk about which in
[890.24 - 893.92] this book and so
[892.40 - 896.08] i want to answer as many questions as i
[893.92 - 899.84] can
[896.08 - 899.84] but good question
[900.72 - 903.92] and thank you for asking it
[908.72 - 915.36] hey arizona i hope from
[912.00 - 917.84] arizona amazing so
[915.36 - 919.12] wendy says my name is wendy i have
[917.84 - 921.60] healed my thyroid
[919.12 - 923.76] i am so proud of you that is incredible
[921.60 - 924.64] and that's an accomplishment that's an
[923.76 - 926.56] incredible
[924.64 - 928.08] accomplishment it really is it's so
[926.56 - 928.88] helpful too for other people to know
[928.08 - 931.28] that
[928.88 - 932.80] you're doing your celery juice 16 ounces
[931.28 - 936.80] that's wonderful
[932.80 - 938.40] um okay so carrie can you talk about
[936.80 - 941.68] bipolar
[938.40 - 945.20] so i would love to um bipolar
[941.68 - 947.36] is a diagnosis for
[945.20 - 948.72] no one in medical research and science
[947.36 - 951.04] or anywhere knowing
[948.72 - 952.08] why how what the cause is what it is
[951.04 - 955.68] okay so
[952.08 - 956.64] it's a really silly name for a condition
[955.68 - 958.88] that's really
[956.64 - 960.40] hard to live with when someone you know
[958.88 - 962.08] when you're suffering with it yourself
[960.40 - 963.92] it's really hard and
[962.08 - 965.84] so they they don't know what causes it
[963.92 - 968.96] so they name it bipolar which means
[965.84 - 970.56] north south up and down so all the
[968.96 - 973.60] research and science we have
[970.56 - 976.08] all the technology we have all of the
[973.60 - 977.84] studies and peer review studies and all
[976.08 - 980.48] of the stuff that we got going on
[977.84 - 982.00] the best they can do is you're either up
[980.48 - 985.44] or you're down that's what they tell
[982.00 - 986.88] you it's sad i think bipolar is probably
[985.44 - 989.52] quintessentially
[986.88 - 991.28] an example of how screwed up the system
[989.52 - 992.72] is and how screwed up the medical system
[991.28 - 994.88] is and how screwed up research and
[992.72 - 997.04] science it is because
[994.88 - 999.12] they're better off just saying we don't
[997.04 - 1001.04] know why you're going through this we
[999.12 - 1003.04] don't know why you're suffering we don't
[1001.04 - 1003.52] know why you're hurting so bad and
[1003.04 - 1006.24] you're
[1003.52 - 1007.44] you're emotional and you're you're in
[1006.24 - 1009.68] agony and you're
[1007.44 - 1011.60] in the depression and you're not feeling
[1009.68 - 1012.00] good or you're manic and we don't know
[1011.60 - 1015.12] why
[1012.00 - 1016.80] all that's happening and so
[1015.12 - 1018.24] i wish they would be honest and not not
[1016.80 - 1020.96] be in denial but what they do
[1018.24 - 1021.84] is they will name it something bipolar
[1020.96 - 1024.72] which means
[1021.84 - 1025.12] nothing it just means they think you're
[1024.72 - 1027.92] either
[1025.12 - 1029.84] up or you're down it's really sad toxic
[1027.92 - 1031.84] heavy metals is the cause of
[1029.84 - 1033.44] that term bipolar it's the cause of
[1031.84 - 1034.88] somebody being all over the place like
[1033.44 - 1036.16] that where they're hurting emotionally
[1034.88 - 1038.08] and they're up and they're down and
[1036.16 - 1039.44] they're all over the place and it's then
[1038.08 - 1042.16] it's you know mercury
[1039.44 - 1044.24] big part of it so that's mercury is the
[1042.16 - 1045.84] issue behind that so that means
[1044.24 - 1047.84] you can go you can go and get a mercury
[1045.84 - 1049.52] test at the doctor you can go to your
[1047.84 - 1051.84] doctor get a mercury test
[1049.52 - 1052.88] um but it may not show up because
[1051.84 - 1055.12] mercury
[1052.88 - 1056.64] is inside organs and it gets inside our
[1055.12 - 1057.92] brain and it gets in center of liver and
[1056.64 - 1061.20] it gets inside our organs
[1057.92 - 1061.68] and so they won't see that in a blood
[1061.20 - 1064.56] test
[1061.68 - 1065.04] because it's inside organs and organ
[1064.56 - 1066.88] tissue
[1065.04 - 1068.88] you can't test for that easily but you
[1066.88 - 1069.84] can at least you can ask the doctor and
[1068.88 - 1071.52] tell them look
[1069.84 - 1072.88] i i think i got some heavy metals i
[1071.52 - 1074.16] think i got some mercury
[1072.88 - 1075.92] and you can you know you can learn
[1074.16 - 1077.92] information on how to you can take
[1075.92 - 1079.04] the cleanse of heal book to your doctor
[1077.92 - 1081.84] talk to them about
[1079.04 - 1083.28] you know toxic heavy metals i have a
[1081.84 - 1084.96] heavy metal detox cleanse ask your
[1083.28 - 1088.48] doctor if that works for you
[1084.96 - 1090.40] and but the bottom line is it's really
[1088.48 - 1092.64] sad when they don't have an answer
[1090.40 - 1093.60] instead they kind of like basically say
[1092.64 - 1095.92] something
[1093.60 - 1097.68] they give it a ridiculous name i mean it
[1095.92 - 1099.92] just doesn't make any sense
[1097.68 - 1101.92] um but the heavy medical medium heavy
[1099.92 - 1105.36] metal detox cleanse is important they
[1101.92 - 1109.36] if they only would give it its real
[1105.36 - 1110.88] the real thing like you got mercury and
[1109.36 - 1113.28] you know mercury poisoning so that's
[1110.88 - 1113.28] what it is
[1114.32 - 1117.28] that's what i tell doctors all the time
[1115.60 - 1117.76] so they know about it i just want to say
[1117.28 - 1120.48] that
[1117.76 - 1120.96] your frozen shoulder remedies are spot
[1120.48 - 1124.00] on
[1120.96 - 1126.16] so cheryl says that cured my husband
[1124.00 - 1127.04] in a few weeks while others are having
[1126.16 - 1130.80] surgeries
[1127.04 - 1133.20] in mua et cetera and suffering for years
[1130.80 - 1135.12] thank you well the frozen shoulder thing
[1133.20 - 1137.60] is is the shingles
[1135.12 - 1140.24] and research in science doesn't know
[1137.60 - 1142.88] that and so they look for
[1140.24 - 1144.64] they look for um and they look for
[1142.88 - 1147.12] tissue connective tissue that's messed
[1144.64 - 1149.04] up they look for tears
[1147.12 - 1150.32] they look for cartilage issues they look
[1149.04 - 1151.68] for spurs
[1150.32 - 1153.28] they look for all this by the way i'm
[1151.68 - 1154.88] really proud of you i'm proud of your
[1153.28 - 1156.96] husband really proud of you
[1154.88 - 1159.04] cheryl they look for all this stuff and
[1156.96 - 1162.24] then they put people under surgery and
[1159.04 - 1163.76] i'm not anti-surgery i'm not anti uh i
[1162.24 - 1165.12] mean i know surgeons i've talked to
[1163.76 - 1166.48] surgeons there's times when we need it
[1165.12 - 1168.08] there's times when we don't but what i
[1166.48 - 1169.36] like to do with frozen shoulders i like
[1168.08 - 1173.04] to go
[1169.36 - 1175.44] this way which is you're inflamed
[1173.04 - 1177.20] and we need to give it a chance to heal
[1175.44 - 1179.36] before we jump into surgery
[1177.20 - 1180.56] and so i'm proud of you and your husband
[1179.36 - 1182.72] because you did
[1180.56 - 1184.56] protocols you speci you did them
[1182.72 - 1186.00] specifically for you you customized it
[1184.56 - 1186.88] for you you knew how to use the
[1186.00 - 1188.40] information
[1186.88 - 1190.72] so that your husband could actually get
[1188.40 - 1194.08] the inflammation down
[1190.72 - 1196.08] with the information and get it down
[1194.08 - 1197.36] and so that you can get the shingles
[1196.08 - 1199.44] down because that's what it is the
[1197.36 - 1199.76] protocol is designed for frozen shoulder
[1199.44 - 1203.36] for
[1199.76 - 1205.36] shingles so that somebody cannot be in
[1203.36 - 1207.76] pain anymore with their shoulder
[1205.36 - 1208.96] and and others yeah other people they
[1207.76 - 1210.40] have to go get the surgery they don't
[1208.96 - 1211.60] know about the protocol they don't know
[1210.40 - 1212.96] about knocking down
[1211.60 - 1216.08] the shingles they don't know about all
[1212.96 - 1216.08] that so they don't know what to do
[1217.84 - 1221.12] i'm really proud of you cheryl really
[1219.28 - 1223.20] proud of you and your husband because
[1221.12 - 1224.64] sounds to me like you read the book you
[1223.20 - 1227.76] opened it you read it
[1224.64 - 1227.76] and you're like you know what
[1227.92 - 1232.00] a lot of people they just right now in
[1230.64 - 1233.60] this day and age
[1232.00 - 1235.52] some people are like i don't i want to
[1233.60 - 1237.76] just find a video somewhere
[1235.52 - 1241.52] and not read a book but it's important
[1237.76 - 1241.52] to read it if the information's there
[1242.48 - 1246.08] susan do you know anything about
[1244.08 - 1248.24] orthostatic tremors
[1246.08 - 1249.76] so and when it comes down to tremors
[1248.24 - 1250.96] you're talking nervous system
[1249.76 - 1252.16] so when you're talking about nervous
[1250.96 - 1253.52] system you're talking about a couple of
[1252.16 - 1255.36] things there
[1253.52 - 1257.36] if you're if you went to your doctors if
[1255.36 - 1258.64] you went to your um neurologist and they
[1257.36 - 1260.64] did all their tests
[1258.64 - 1262.24] they did their mris they did their cat
[1260.64 - 1262.96] scans they did everything that they want
[1262.24 - 1264.64] to do
[1262.96 - 1266.32] and they can't find anything they can't
[1264.64 - 1267.92] find a brain tumor they can't find
[1266.32 - 1269.84] something else they can't find
[1267.92 - 1271.36] and you're in this land of what do i do
[1269.84 - 1273.68] and now it's under this label
[1271.36 - 1275.28] or the static tremors and what do i do
[1273.68 - 1276.08] and when you're in that zone then you
[1275.28 - 1278.64] have to realize
[1276.08 - 1280.24] well okay then you look at like cleanse
[1278.64 - 1282.08] the heel you take it to your doctor
[1280.24 - 1283.76] you look at cleanse the heel and you'll
[1282.08 - 1286.48] be like okay tremors
[1283.76 - 1288.08] and you'll see that that's the central
[1286.48 - 1290.08] nervous system and you'll be like whoa
[1288.08 - 1291.04] there's an actual reason for this
[1290.08 - 1293.12] and when you see there's an actual
[1291.04 - 1295.68] reason which is viruses
[1293.12 - 1296.72] such as epstein-barr shingles so forth
[1295.68 - 1298.56] and and
[1296.72 - 1299.76] in other viruses too but viruses such as
[1298.56 - 1301.68] epstein-barr and shingles
[1299.76 - 1303.04] they release a neurotoxin that
[1301.68 - 1306.24] neurotoxin
[1303.04 - 1308.00] clings to nerves causes tremors and then
[1306.24 - 1310.40] that neurotoxin is also
[1308.00 - 1312.48] heavy metal based toxic heavy metal
[1310.40 - 1315.04] based so the viruses such as ebv
[1312.48 - 1317.20] feeds off of mercury then releases a
[1315.04 - 1319.44] mercury byproduct that mercury byproduct
[1317.20 - 1320.56] is so highly toxic it causes tremors it
[1319.44 - 1322.56] clings to the nerves
[1320.56 - 1324.56] clings to the vagus nerve the phrenic
[1322.56 - 1325.28] nerves um all the different nerves and
[1324.56 - 1328.08] then
[1325.28 - 1330.00] you get that tremor and so it's good to
[1328.08 - 1331.44] know what's going on so hey if i had
[1330.00 - 1332.72] orthostatic tremors what i would be
[1331.44 - 1333.92] doing is i'd be like trying to get the
[1332.72 - 1336.16] metals out number one
[1333.92 - 1338.08] i'd be trying to um i'd be eliminating
[1336.16 - 1340.32] foods like eggs
[1338.08 - 1342.24] get the eggs out because eggs raised
[1340.32 - 1344.40] they raised viruses with eggs
[1342.24 - 1346.08] in labs released the viruses over over
[1344.40 - 1347.76] the years somehow they got out
[1346.08 - 1349.76] and these viruses got into people
[1347.76 - 1350.24] throughout the decades and then boom we
[1349.76 - 1353.36] got
[1350.24 - 1353.36] orthostatic tremors
[1355.84 - 1360.96] so okay hi anthony i had breast implants
[1359.20 - 1364.96] two years ago
[1360.96 - 1366.48] so madolina so breast implants two years
[1364.96 - 1368.16] ago since then i've been suffering from
[1366.48 - 1371.44] chronic bloating and
[1368.16 - 1374.08] vaginal candida my left breast implants
[1371.44 - 1375.60] has always been harder than the other do
[1374.08 - 1377.68] you think i can recover from these
[1375.60 - 1380.16] symptoms without removing implants
[1377.68 - 1381.76] i've just i have to say that without
[1380.16 - 1383.20] realizing i've been suffering from these
[1381.76 - 1385.12] symptoms since i was
[1383.20 - 1387.68] little but now it looks like with the
[1385.12 - 1390.88] implants they got much worse so
[1387.68 - 1392.72] okay for for for one um
[1390.88 - 1394.88] like the vaginal candida when you're
[1392.72 - 1396.32] when you're candida is
[1394.88 - 1398.00] a label for when they don't know what's
[1396.32 - 1399.36] really happening underneath things and
[1398.00 - 1401.76] not underneath it all
[1399.36 - 1403.44] and so i i tell doctors this all the
[1401.76 - 1405.04] time they ask me about candida because
[1403.44 - 1405.68] candida is really confusing for a lot of
[1405.04 - 1406.88] people and
[1405.68 - 1408.80] it's never really candida it's
[1406.88 - 1409.44] streptococcus and then candida gets the
[1408.80 - 1411.12] label
[1409.44 - 1412.80] yeast infections get the label when it's
[1411.12 - 1414.24] streptococcus so
[1412.80 - 1416.00] and then if you read the medical medium
[1414.24 - 1418.72] books you'll learn that strep is a
[1416.00 - 1420.00] cofactor to ebv so scrap is a cofactor
[1418.72 - 1422.96] to epstein-barr
[1420.00 - 1424.48] and then breast implant illness is
[1422.96 - 1428.48] fatigue in the brain fog
[1424.48 - 1431.04] and the nerve pain and all that combined
[1428.48 - 1432.24] and that's neurological so then you're
[1431.04 - 1435.52] looking at
[1432.24 - 1437.12] viral plus viral creating neurological
[1435.52 - 1439.60] and then you kind of find your way and
[1437.12 - 1442.40] then you realize it's viruses that's why
[1439.60 - 1444.40] one one a woman can have breast implants
[1442.40 - 1446.48] and not have any problems because
[1444.40 - 1447.52] she may not have she doesn't have an
[1446.48 - 1449.12] active viral
[1447.52 - 1450.80] issue in the moment so what i would do
[1449.12 - 1452.56] is go to your doctor say look do i have
[1450.80 - 1454.24] any kind of viral stuff going on do i
[1452.56 - 1455.20] have any kind of epstein-barr going on
[1454.24 - 1457.76] because that
[1455.20 - 1459.84] that's what happens and um and it comes
[1457.76 - 1461.12] out usually later so women with breast
[1459.84 - 1463.36] implant illness
[1461.12 - 1465.04] end up finding epstein-barr in their
[1463.36 - 1466.80] blood at a doctor's office
[1465.04 - 1468.16] two years down the road three years down
[1466.80 - 1469.60] the road because it's hard to pick it
[1468.16 - 1472.40] off at a lot of times during the blood
[1469.60 - 1476.08] test you got to keep on going over time
[1472.40 - 1478.32] and so um breast implants can
[1476.08 - 1479.92] you know what happens is they can be a
[1478.32 - 1481.44] trigger if something's going wrong with
[1479.92 - 1483.76] them they can be a trigger but you have
[1481.44 - 1486.48] to have something inside of you
[1483.76 - 1488.40] that's getting triggered and the epstein
[1486.48 - 1491.44] bar will create the brain fog
[1488.40 - 1493.04] the fatigue um all kinds of different
[1491.44 - 1493.76] symptoms and so forth and that's what's
[1493.04 - 1496.32] happening
[1493.76 - 1497.68] and that's why it's important like when
[1496.32 - 1500.00] i go to cleanse the heal i'm like well
[1497.68 - 1501.60] what's the symptom you're dealing with
[1500.00 - 1504.16] and it's also why you had symptoms when
[1501.60 - 1506.72] you're younger you notice madelina like
[1504.16 - 1508.24] you said exactly you know you without
[1506.72 - 1509.04] realizing it you were suffering from
[1508.24 - 1511.44] these symptoms
[1509.04 - 1513.60] since you were little but now it looks
[1511.44 - 1515.04] like the implants got that much worse
[1513.60 - 1517.44] what were those symptoms when you were a
[1515.04 - 1520.64] little fatigued or were they fatigued
[1517.44 - 1522.80] brain fog anxiety were they body pain
[1520.64 - 1523.76] were they tingles and numbness when you
[1522.80 - 1526.32] were little
[1523.76 - 1526.88] and then migraines and then the breast
[1526.32 - 1529.20] implants
[1526.88 - 1531.04] could worsen them because they became
[1529.20 - 1533.36] kind of a little bit of a trigger so
[1531.04 - 1534.96] okay if if i had breast implants okay
[1533.36 - 1536.32] now if i was a woman i would just be
[1534.96 - 1539.12] working on
[1536.32 - 1539.68] i would be working on the underlying
[1539.12 - 1541.52] issue
[1539.68 - 1544.08] so i'd be working on that and so i'd
[1541.52 - 1545.52] look at the symptoms and find out what
[1544.08 - 1546.88] were the symptoms i had when i was
[1545.52 - 1547.36] younger obviously you're experiencing
[1546.88 - 1548.72] them
[1547.36 - 1550.00] that's what i would do and i'd be like
[1548.72 - 1551.44] what are those symptoms let me find
[1550.00 - 1552.40] those symptoms find out what the real
[1551.44 - 1557.84] causes start
[1552.40 - 1557.84] there you can talk to your doctor
[1573.04 - 1577.36] so that's a good question there cindy
[1574.56 - 1579.60] says why is it that you have to go to so
[1577.36 - 1582.00] many doctors for every problem
[1579.60 - 1584.24] i have to go to many doctors and visit i
[1582.00 - 1585.44] have internal medicine doctor it's good
[1584.24 - 1587.60] that you have one of those
[1585.44 - 1589.12] refers me out to pulmonologists yeah i
[1587.60 - 1590.08] know because he probably doesn't do
[1589.12 - 1592.48] pulmonology
[1590.08 - 1593.12] and then you got the bladder doctor yeah
[1592.48 - 1594.64] you got the
[1593.12 - 1596.40] you know the bladder doctor urologist
[1594.64 - 1598.96] and everything else you got
[1596.40 - 1600.48] in the heart doctor right cardiologist
[1598.96 - 1601.44] and what happened to the doctor who can
[1600.48 - 1603.84] help you with
[1601.44 - 1605.92] without so many of the doctors yeah
[1603.84 - 1608.00] totally i i completely understand
[1605.92 - 1609.36] um you know it's it's like that even in
[1608.00 - 1611.36] alternative medicine too
[1609.36 - 1612.72] it's it's funny like alternative
[1611.36 - 1613.68] alternative medicine you'll get a guy
[1612.72 - 1615.12] that only does this
[1613.68 - 1617.20] and you'll get somebody that only does
[1615.12 - 1619.20] this and it's whatever really what the
[1617.20 - 1620.88] doctor likes to focus on like the lyme
[1619.20 - 1622.00] doctor just wants to focus online but
[1620.88 - 1623.76] what's funny about that
[1622.00 - 1625.04] anybody who goes to him will get a lyme
[1623.76 - 1627.04] diagnosis so
[1625.04 - 1628.24] that's the only problem anyone who goes
[1627.04 - 1629.04] to another doctor will get another
[1628.24 - 1630.16] diagnosis
[1629.04 - 1632.16] it's pretty funny in alternative
[1630.16 - 1634.16] medicine if you go to a gut doctor in
[1632.16 - 1637.12] alternative medicine they just focus on
[1634.16 - 1638.96] say you know microbiome every single
[1637.12 - 1640.88] person leaving will be microbiome
[1638.96 - 1641.92] microbiome microbiome here's some here's
[1640.88 - 1643.68] some probiotics
[1641.92 - 1645.28] out the door here's some probiotics out
[1643.68 - 1646.08] the door you go to a lime doctor it's
[1645.28 - 1647.84] like you got lime
[1646.08 - 1650.64] out the door out the door lime trap lime
[1647.84 - 1651.20] trap and so it's it's crazy how it works
[1650.64 - 1653.76] but
[1651.20 - 1655.36] but i get it it's a lot of guys and and
[1653.76 - 1658.00] in the business they just want to do
[1655.36 - 1659.12] their one specialty but yet you know
[1658.00 - 1661.60] they have to send you out for everything
[1659.12 - 1664.88] else under the sun
[1661.60 - 1668.64] michelle hot flashes from sluggish liver
[1664.88 - 1670.24] yeah totally and um absolutely
[1668.64 - 1672.00] michelle thanks so much for all the work
[1670.24 - 1673.04] you do by the way because i see your
[1672.00 - 1676.24] comments out there
[1673.04 - 1678.16] and um and they're always spot on
[1676.24 - 1679.76] they're they're always just spot on it's
[1678.16 - 1681.20] it's amazing how much you know
[1679.76 - 1682.88] it's amazing how much medical medium
[1681.20 - 1685.36] information you know and
[1682.88 - 1686.80] it's it's incredible really and you're
[1685.36 - 1687.36] obviously reading the books and you
[1686.80 - 1688.88] obviously
[1687.36 - 1691.28] know what you're reading and
[1688.88 - 1693.12] understanding because these are medical
[1691.28 - 1697.84] textbooks so
[1693.12 - 1697.84] it's amazing michelle
[1700.00 - 1705.12] so dana says if you've had mono
[1703.20 - 1706.80] how long can the epstein-barr virus stay
[1705.12 - 1709.44] in your system
[1706.80 - 1710.64] which book has protocol for this i would
[1709.44 - 1711.28] start with cleanse the heel go to the
[1710.64 - 1714.48] library
[1711.28 - 1716.16] get it for free and
[1714.48 - 1718.08] what is your you know what what is your
[1716.16 - 1719.44] symptoms too what that's what i would do
[1718.08 - 1720.72] i would say what is my symptom and i
[1719.44 - 1722.48] would go back into here
[1720.72 - 1725.12] there's over 200 symptoms and conditions
[1722.48 - 1727.04] if you also want to like
[1725.12 - 1728.64] you know keep your immune system strong
[1727.04 - 1729.20] and you can look at any number one of
[1728.64 - 1730.72] the any
[1729.20 - 1732.72] any number of these cleanses but i would
[1730.72 - 1733.76] read the book take one page at a time
[1732.72 - 1738.24] and get through it and
[1733.76 - 1739.68] you can learn so much about that
[1738.24 - 1741.84] you know really what happens the medical
[1739.68 - 1743.36] media books exploded epstein-barr out
[1741.84 - 1745.04] there in the scene in the world
[1743.36 - 1747.60] now you're hearing it everywhere out
[1745.04 - 1749.04] there that's for millions of copies sold
[1747.60 - 1750.40] out there like if you read the little
[1749.04 - 1752.48] gold emblem on here millions of the
[1750.40 - 1753.60] medical medium series sold out there all
[1752.48 - 1756.32] around the world
[1753.60 - 1756.88] medical medium book one just went
[1756.32 - 1759.36] everywhere
[1756.88 - 1761.36] around the globe and millions of people
[1759.36 - 1763.44] learned about epstein-barr
[1761.36 - 1765.12] and but here's the thing what never
[1763.44 - 1768.56] existed out there before was
[1765.12 - 1770.16] what epstein-barr causes what symptoms
[1768.56 - 1771.92] nobody knew any of that that's all
[1770.16 - 1773.76] medical medium information
[1771.92 - 1775.44] they only thought epstein-barr caused a
[1773.76 - 1777.44] little little bit of fatigue
[1775.44 - 1779.20] and a little bit of malaise and a little
[1777.44 - 1780.40] fever once in a while that was all they
[1779.20 - 1782.48] knew and
[1780.40 - 1784.64] medical medium information opened the
[1782.48 - 1785.60] door for the first time in medical
[1784.64 - 1788.56] history
[1785.60 - 1790.24] to actually link epstein-barr to all the
[1788.56 - 1792.00] symptoms and conditions and it was
[1790.24 - 1792.48] published by medical medium first and
[1792.00 - 1794.72] also
[1792.48 - 1796.64] i taught it and lectured it to doctors
[1794.72 - 1799.04] over the last 35 years
[1796.64 - 1800.32] and it's incredible what has happened
[1799.04 - 1801.92] and transpired by that
[1800.32 - 1803.68] spillings are being helped but the only
[1801.92 - 1805.84] problem is it this
[1803.68 - 1807.28] it doesn't get cited back to me many of
[1805.84 - 1808.24] it doesn't get so people don't know
[1807.28 - 1809.76] where to get the
[1808.24 - 1811.68] information the protocols more
[1809.76 - 1814.56] information about epstein-barr like all
[1811.68 - 1814.56] the ins and outs
[1816.08 - 1825.44] so yeah
[1822.64 - 1827.60] let's see um donna very first time on
[1825.44 - 1828.96] with same issue hot flashes how do you
[1827.60 - 1830.40] fix
[1828.96 - 1832.88] what you definitely want to start with
[1830.40 - 1835.28] lowering your fats hot flashes
[1832.88 - 1836.32] sluggish liver you got to look at it
[1835.28 - 1838.48] that way and you want to
[1836.32 - 1840.24] reduce your fats if if your animal
[1838.48 - 1842.00] protein okay which i'm pro animal
[1840.24 - 1843.84] protein if that's what you like
[1842.00 - 1845.36] you you just got to reduce your your
[1843.84 - 1846.88] meats and stuff like that i mean i would
[1845.36 - 1848.16] get off of dairy products number one
[1846.88 - 1849.12] that's what i would do personally if i
[1848.16 - 1851.76] had hot flashes
[1849.12 - 1852.72] i would get off milk cheese butter kefir
[1851.76 - 1855.76] yogurt gone
[1852.72 - 1858.56] i would get rid of that and you know and
[1855.76 - 1859.52] and i would start with their eggs get
[1858.56 - 1861.12] rid of eggs
[1859.52 - 1862.32] boom get rid of all that if you're if
[1861.12 - 1863.28] you're eating animal protein then i
[1862.32 - 1865.28] would lower
[1863.28 - 1866.56] the amount of animal protein that i was
[1865.28 - 1868.88] eating i would
[1866.56 - 1870.32] reduce it so maybe it's only once a day
[1868.88 - 1873.60] or once every other day
[1870.32 - 1875.12] if you're plant-based i would reduce
[1873.60 - 1877.12] okay if you're plant-based i'll make
[1875.12 - 1879.36] sure you're gluten-free of course
[1877.12 - 1880.96] i would stay away from nutritional yeast
[1879.36 - 1883.44] for sure because that would just
[1880.96 - 1884.64] ruin the liver and then you know get rid
[1883.44 - 1886.32] of that
[1884.64 - 1887.92] and then i would reduce the amount of
[1886.32 - 1890.72] nuts seeds
[1887.92 - 1891.68] nuts seeds avocado i would reduce all
[1890.72 - 1894.40] that
[1891.68 - 1896.08] oils reduce all that bring that down and
[1894.40 - 1897.36] lower your fats there if you got if you
[1896.08 - 1898.16] got the hot flashes whether you're
[1897.36 - 1900.40] plant-based or
[1898.16 - 1901.36] animal product so that's what i would do
[1900.40 - 1903.44] because i'm pro
[1901.36 - 1905.28] all the diets yeah i'm pro whatever you
[1903.44 - 1907.60] want to be but i want to help you
[1905.28 - 1908.64] be the best at what you love to do if
[1907.60 - 1910.08] you love plant-based
[1908.64 - 1912.56] i want to help you do it right if you
[1910.08 - 1914.72] love the animal protein based diet
[1912.56 - 1915.84] if you're if you're an animal baser i
[1914.72 - 1916.80] want to help you do if you're a
[1915.84 - 1918.88] plant-baser
[1916.80 - 1920.48] i want to help you do it and and make
[1918.88 - 1922.40] sure it works for you and
[1920.48 - 1924.16] cleaning up that liver and making sure
[1922.40 - 1926.32] that liver gets cleaned up
[1924.16 - 1929.28] and this is just one part of it right
[1926.32 - 1929.28] here a tool for it
[1931.06 - 1935.84] [Music]
[1932.32 - 1937.12] that was 30 30 ounces of celery juice
[1935.84 - 1938.16] and i'm working through it right now
[1937.12 - 1941.04] tonight for dinner
[1938.16 - 1943.60] but i also have fresh squeezed orange
[1941.04 - 1943.60] juice right here
[1943.84 - 1951.60] for my dinner
[1949.60 - 1953.04] but sluggish liver doesn't just resolve
[1951.60 - 1955.04] in one shot
[1953.04 - 1956.88] you got to work on it and so i mean do
[1955.04 - 1958.56] you have cleanse to heal
[1956.88 - 1959.76] are you there yet have you gotten to
[1958.56 - 1961.60] cleanse heal are you doing some of the
[1959.76 - 1964.40] cleanses you're doing the 369 to really
[1961.60 - 1966.16] clean up that liver
[1964.40 - 1969.04] but you can get yourself on the way so
[1966.16 - 1969.04] it's important to know
[1969.44 - 1973.12] so liza love you anthony hey love you
[1972.80 - 1976.40] too
[1973.12 - 1978.40] i have been on all your books incredible
[1976.40 - 1980.40] over a year starting with liver rescue
[1978.40 - 1983.92] due to liver methylation issue
[1980.40 - 1986.64] incredible i completed 20 day
[1983.92 - 1988.48] 28 day cleanse 369 and i'm doing 32
[1986.64 - 1990.16] ounces of celery juice daily
[1988.48 - 1991.60] have many improvements so you got lots
[1990.16 - 1993.44] of improvements but hair
[1991.60 - 1995.68] still falling out does this mean i
[1993.44 - 1999.04] haven't found the root problem
[1995.68 - 2002.16] so look i'm not a flying fly on the wall
[1999.04 - 2004.08] um at your house and but what's you know
[2002.16 - 2006.56] first time it could take a little time
[2004.08 - 2008.40] and one thing's for sure that that when
[2006.56 - 2009.28] it comes down to the hair still falling
[2008.40 - 2012.56] out
[2009.28 - 2014.40] hair falls out later later on so what
[2012.56 - 2015.28] happens is if you've had a rough couple
[2014.40 - 2017.84] of years
[2015.28 - 2018.88] or a few years then the hair falls out
[2017.84 - 2021.76] later
[2018.88 - 2022.64] and i just you know i imagine you're not
[2021.76 - 2024.32] on caffeine
[2022.64 - 2025.84] but did you do caffeine in the past
[2024.32 - 2027.52] because you can have this delayed effect
[2025.84 - 2028.16] where hair falls out much later because
[2027.52 - 2030.16] of it
[2028.16 - 2033.28] did you do the matcha tea did you do the
[2030.16 - 2035.84] green tea matcha tea coffee drinks cacao
[2033.28 - 2036.32] that's that just makes hair fall out for
[2035.84 - 2038.24] women
[2036.32 - 2040.00] it's really sad it beats their adrenals
[2038.24 - 2041.76] down and you end up losing one of the
[2040.00 - 2042.80] adrenaline hormone blends one of the
[2041.76 - 2044.48] adrenal hormones
[2042.80 - 2046.16] when you lose that just hair continues
[2044.48 - 2047.44] to fall out for a long time it can take
[2046.16 - 2049.76] a long time to restore
[2047.44 - 2051.52] and are you doing supplement protocols
[2049.76 - 2053.44] in the books too are you customizing
[2051.52 - 2055.28] them for yourself to what's going on
[2053.44 - 2056.64] like the hair loss protocol and cleanse
[2055.28 - 2058.48] the heel
[2056.64 - 2060.16] and that's something right there and you
[2058.48 - 2061.28] know and i'm look i'm sure you are you
[2060.16 - 2062.40] got the books you're working on i'm
[2061.28 - 2064.64] really proud of you
[2062.40 - 2066.16] it you know you can get there and i'm
[2064.64 - 2069.36] really really proud of you actually
[2066.16 - 2069.36] incredible incredible
[2070.48 - 2074.40] rebecca says i have both these books do
[2072.32 - 2076.88] you consult with people i don't consult
[2074.40 - 2079.28] with people i just consult doctors
[2076.88 - 2080.72] um that's that's and i've done that for
[2079.28 - 2082.96] 35 years
[2080.72 - 2085.84] the reason reasons why i had so many
[2082.96 - 2088.16] people come to me when i used to consult
[2085.84 - 2090.00] many many years ago is through doctors
[2088.16 - 2091.04] doctors recommendations doctors
[2090.00 - 2093.36] recommending people
[2091.04 - 2095.04] to talk to me but i still have all those
[2093.36 - 2096.64] relationships with hundreds of doctors
[2095.04 - 2098.00] over the years plus new ones contacting
[2096.64 - 2100.08] me so what i do is
[2098.00 - 2101.36] i do help doctors on a daily basis so
[2100.08 - 2102.88] they can help their patients
[2101.36 - 2104.08] so you can bring any right back you can
[2102.88 - 2104.80] bring any of this information in the
[2104.08 - 2106.32] book or from
[2104.80 - 2108.56] what i'm helping you now with to your
[2106.32 - 2109.76] doctor of course so you have both these
[2108.56 - 2112.72] books amazing
[2109.76 - 2113.52] and you've had two neurologists tell me
[2112.72 - 2117.12] i have
[2113.52 - 2120.56] anxiety after having an mri eeg
[2117.12 - 2122.72] emg and i was cleared so
[2120.56 - 2124.24] so you had the eeg you had the mri and
[2122.72 - 2126.16] the emg
[2124.24 - 2127.60] and you're cleared so they but they say
[2126.16 - 2129.20] you have anxiety i have twitching
[2127.60 - 2131.44] involuntary movements
[2129.20 - 2132.40] jerks vibrations and basically they just
[2131.44 - 2135.84] say
[2132.40 - 2139.52] uh okay economists
[2135.84 - 2139.84] they cannot find anything what direction
[2139.52 - 2143.28] to
[2139.84 - 2145.44] turn so they say you just have anxiety
[2143.28 - 2146.56] um so if you look at the medical medium
[2145.44 - 2147.84] books and you look at
[2146.56 - 2149.28] cleanse the healing you can take the
[2147.84 - 2150.08] information to your doctor and i'm asked
[2149.28 - 2152.72] this by doctors
[2150.08 - 2154.24] and um this is neurological your
[2152.72 - 2156.16] symptoms are neurological
[2154.24 - 2157.84] so you look at your symptoms so when you
[2156.16 - 2159.04] look at cleanse the heel and you go back
[2157.84 - 2161.84] in there and you'll find
[2159.04 - 2163.04] twitching you'll find um you'll find
[2161.84 - 2165.44] that in there like the
[2163.04 - 2166.40] vibrations i talk about that when the
[2165.44 - 2170.24] body's humming
[2166.40 - 2172.40] buzzing vibrating twitching spasms
[2170.24 - 2173.92] you know ticks and spasms twitches all
[2172.40 - 2174.96] that stuff you'll find it in the back of
[2173.92 - 2176.72] the book
[2174.96 - 2178.16] and and you'll learn what the true
[2176.72 - 2179.28] causes are and then you'll be like whoa
[2178.16 - 2180.80] i found the true cause and you can go
[2179.28 - 2182.64] and take that to your doctor or work
[2180.80 - 2183.28] with it however you you need to or want
[2182.64 - 2186.40] to
[2183.28 - 2187.20] but that's that's you can find answers
[2186.40 - 2189.76] for that
[2187.20 - 2191.92] and and then you can even go into the
[2189.76 - 2193.60] anxiety section if you want to but
[2191.92 - 2195.60] that's not
[2193.60 - 2197.44] if if i had that i would know that
[2195.60 - 2198.56] that's not anxiety like if i had the
[2197.44 - 2201.76] jerking
[2198.56 - 2202.56] and the twitching and the spasms and all
[2201.76 - 2204.64] of that
[2202.56 - 2206.64] and i was living with that i would know
[2204.64 - 2209.28] it's not anxiety because i know it's a
[2206.64 - 2212.00] twitch it's a jerk it's a spasm and
[2209.28 - 2214.80] that's not anxiety
[2212.00 - 2216.88] it's just that anxiety doesn't help it
[2214.80 - 2220.16] but anxiety also can happen
[2216.88 - 2220.16] simultaneously with it
[2224.56 - 2228.32] veronica what do you think about dmso
[2226.96 - 2230.24] please i don't like it
[2228.32 - 2231.44] i mean i'm not a fan of it i think it's
[2230.24 - 2232.72] what happens is when you have nervous
[2231.44 - 2234.40] system conditions and your nervous
[2232.72 - 2237.20] system is inflamed because of real
[2234.40 - 2238.40] like like real causes like viruses and
[2237.20 - 2242.08] stuff like that
[2238.40 - 2244.40] um and i mean but but
[2242.08 - 2246.72] hey look i mean that's just my opinion
[2244.40 - 2249.04] i'm not a big fan of dmso
[2246.72 - 2250.16] uh only because i find it's a little too
[2249.04 - 2252.32] harsh
[2250.16 - 2253.44] for people with nervous system issues
[2252.32 - 2255.52] that are dealing with
[2253.44 - 2256.72] the chronic fatigue syndrome and the
[2255.52 - 2258.56] tickles and numbness and like the
[2256.72 - 2259.12] twitches and spasms and all that other
[2258.56 - 2261.36] stuff
[2259.12 - 2262.96] burning skin aches and pains all the
[2261.36 - 2265.36] nervous system stuff
[2262.96 - 2266.48] i'm not a fan of dms so i just you'll
[2265.36 - 2267.84] find look
[2266.48 - 2269.28] some of the answers to your questions
[2267.84 - 2270.32] will be answered if you read the books
[2269.28 - 2272.56] but like he doesn't
[2270.32 - 2274.72] recommend dmso he doesn't recommend
[2272.56 - 2277.28] nutritional yeast he doesn't recommend
[2274.72 - 2277.92] corella he doesn't recommend something
[2277.28 - 2279.36] charcoal
[2277.92 - 2282.84] and then you'll see well if he's not
[2279.36 - 2285.84] talking about it then that's a whole
[2282.84 - 2285.84] thing
[2286.32 - 2292.72] peter hey peter a.w asking gods
[2289.84 - 2293.36] asking god directly for help versus
[2292.72 - 2295.36] angels

[2295.36 - 2301.20] help there's no question

[2337.28 - 2342.64] so nancy says i ate an egg tonight what
[2340.56 - 2346.24] should i do now
[2342.64 - 2347.52] oh you know it's okay if you had an egg
[2346.24 - 2349.52] tonight it's all right
[2347.52 - 2350.96] it's all right just one day at a time i
[2349.52 - 2351.52] mean if you're are you dealing with
[2350.96 - 2353.04] symptoms
[2351.52 - 2355.20] are you dealing with the condition then
[2353.04 - 2358.24] just i wouldn't do any more eggs
[2355.20 - 2360.08] if you can um that's all right look it's
[2358.24 - 2361.36] it's not an easy time for anybody right
[2360.08 - 2362.96] now with what's happening
[2361.36 - 2365.36] with the plague that's been around us
[2362.96 - 2366.32] and making life so much difficult by the
[2365.36 - 2368.16] way is which
[2366.32 - 2369.76] which is why i want people to build
[2368.16 - 2370.48] their immune systems up it's why i want
[2369.76 - 2372.32] them to be
[2370.48 - 2374.24] you know taking care of themselves but
[2372.32 - 2374.56] it's perfectly fine if that's what you
[2374.24 - 2377.68] did
[2374.56 - 2379.44] it's all right and honestly nancy the
[2377.68 - 2382.72] whole world's eating eggs
[2379.44 - 2384.24] the whole world is eating eggs but um
[2382.72 - 2385.92] but what i would do is avoid them if you
[2384.24 - 2387.28] have a symptom a condition if you have a
[2385.92 - 2390.16] concern with your health
[2387.28 - 2391.76] just avoid them from here on out and and
[2390.16 - 2393.20] do some good things to count i look i
[2391.76 - 2395.36] like celery juice to counter
[2393.20 - 2396.72] any eggs you know because i know people
[2395.36 - 2397.84] that are eating eggs and it's like are
[2396.72 - 2399.04] you still doing your celery juice
[2397.84 - 2400.24] because at least you're doing something
[2399.04 - 2403.52] to counter it all
[2400.24 - 2406.80] and it's not that eggs were bad or
[2403.52 - 2408.72] are bad for us it's just that because
[2406.80 - 2410.40] of what they were used for and i talked
[2408.72 - 2412.96] about that before
[2410.40 - 2414.72] what they were used for to raise bugs in
[2412.96 - 2416.72] the labs years ago and they just
[2414.72 - 2418.08] happened to feed bugs but one egg's not
[2416.72 - 2419.92] going to do it okay people
[2418.08 - 2421.44] one egg's not going to do it all right
[2419.92 - 2422.96] i'm not trying to give everybody a
[2421.44 - 2424.56] license to just gobble down eggs i'm
[2422.96 - 2425.92] just saying that you're gonna be okay
[2424.56 - 2428.96] with that egg
[2425.92 - 2431.28] delight heart don't worry and um
[2428.96 - 2432.88] just try not to have any more if you're
[2431.28 - 2433.68] dealing with a symptom or condition it's
[2432.88 - 2439.20] okay
[2433.68 - 2440.88] it's not gonna hurt
[2439.20 - 2442.80] chrissy says can a protocol help
[2440.88 - 2443.68] tinnitus well what is the cause of
[2442.80 - 2446.48] tinnitus
[2443.68 - 2448.00] so what is it apparently science and
[2446.48 - 2450.40] research doesn't know
[2448.00 - 2452.16] unless you've had decibel damage like
[2450.40 - 2454.56] high decibels and
[2452.16 - 2455.92] you're in rock concerts for you know
[2454.56 - 2458.00] week after week and
[2455.92 - 2459.52] sitting next to the speakers and you had
[2458.00 - 2461.76] your ears just you know

[2465.36 - 2467.92] have this tinnitus that's been

[2470.40 - 2473.12] that that's not
[2471.20 - 2475.20] damage but it's viral tinnitus that's
[2473.12 - 2476.88] when viral issues get into the labyrinth
[2475.20 - 2478.24] of the inner ear they inflame
[2476.88 - 2480.00] the nerve channel there and then you
[2478.24 - 2482.64] start hearing buzzing popping
[2480.00 - 2484.32] ringing all kinds of noises and i talk

[2578.64 - 2582.72] recommended
[2580.24 - 2582.72] the books
[2588.40 - 2592.48] so angela i randomly became dizzy one
[2591.92 - 2594.80] day
[2592.48 - 2595.60] and it won't go away and it feels like
[2594.80 - 2598.24] falling
[2595.60 - 2600.00] right before bed and been on a boat all
[2598.24 - 2602.00] day it's driving me nuts and my heart
[2600.00 - 2603.44] will race and my anxiety goes crazy help
[2602.00 - 2604.32] well your anxiety's gonna go crazy
[2603.44 - 2605.76] because you're
[2604.32 - 2607.12] you're feeling like you're on a boat you
[2605.76 - 2608.32] know what happens that people deal with
[2607.12 - 2610.24] this they feel like they're walking
[2608.32 - 2612.08] along and they're going down
[2610.24 - 2614.24] and it's just like oh my god it's like
[2612.08 - 2614.80] so scary or your your balance is going
[2614.24 - 2616.24] one way
[2614.80 - 2618.48] and not the other and it's really
[2616.24 - 2620.24] difficult it's vertigo so that that's
[2618.48 - 2621.92] that's what that is that's just vertigo
[2620.24 - 2623.76] and um so
[2621.92 - 2625.36] i've talked about this that balanced
[2623.76 - 2626.24] feeling and being on a bow and the true
[2625.36 - 2627.76] causes to that
[2626.24 - 2629.68] now if you've been to your doctors
[2627.76 - 2631.68] you've had your mris you've had all your
[2629.68 - 2633.52] checkups they looked at everything
[2631.68 - 2635.04] they're looking for things and and all
[2633.52 - 2636.64] that well you can bring the book to your
[2635.04 - 2638.00] doctor too and say look since you can't
[2636.64 - 2639.60] find out what's going on
[2638.00 - 2641.12] he's got an answer in here he's got the
[2639.60 - 2642.88] true cause so you can find it in here
[2641.12 - 2646.00] and cleanse the heel in the back and
[2642.88 - 2647.60] vertigo that's you'll see the true cause
[2646.00 - 2648.56] and what happens when the vagus nerve
[2647.60 - 2650.64] gets inflamed
[2648.56 - 2652.80] the vagus nerve gets inflamed by a viral
[2650.64 - 2654.48] infection that they can't find because
[2652.80 - 2655.12] that's how viruses work they're so hard
[2654.48 - 2657.60] to find
[2655.12 - 2659.60] that viral infection keeps that that
[2657.60 - 2660.00] that vertigo going because the vagus
[2659.60 - 2661.60] nerve
[2660.00 - 2663.52] gets a neurotoxin attached to it
[2661.60 - 2664.88] neurotoxin comes from a virus the virus
[2663.52 - 2666.64] eliminates the neurotoxin
[2664.88 - 2668.48] the vagus nerve swells up and then you
[2666.64 - 2669.92] got your boat you're rocking on the boat
[2668.48 - 2672.48] you're going see-sawing and you're doing
[2669.92 - 2674.96] the room spins you hop in bed and the
[2672.48 - 2677.68] room is spinning and that's the type of
[2674.96 - 2679.12] vertigo and i talk about i
[2677.68 - 2681.44] i've been the only one with spirit of
[2679.12 - 2683.60] compassion that that put together
[2681.44 - 2687.12] epstein-barr virus and vertigo
[2683.60 - 2688.40] um and then you can learn how thousands
[2687.12 - 2689.60] of people have healed their vertigo
[2688.40 - 2692.08] through the information
[2689.60 - 2692.64] and spirit of compassion so i hope that
[2692.08 - 2694.32] helps
[2692.64 - 2695.60] so you can you get a direction on where
[2694.32 - 2696.64] to go so you can start thinking about
[2695.60 - 2698.64] what can i do
[2696.64 - 2700.08] maybe maybe embark on the mono eating
[2698.64 - 2701.60] cleanse
[2700.08 - 2702.96] bringing in some celery juice or the
[2701.60 - 2704.72] mono eating cleanse and you start
[2702.96 - 2707.44] working with that so angela so you can
[2704.72 - 2707.44] start getting better
[2712.80 - 2717.20] so lisa says please talk about
[2714.16 - 2717.20] mysterious rashes
[2717.36 - 2720.96] you're welcome so i will talk about it
[2718.96 - 2724.72] for a minute the serious rashes
[2720.96 - 2727.84] eczema is a mysterious rash so
[2724.72 - 2730.24] psoriasis is a mysterious rash um
[2727.84 - 2731.20] rosacea is a mysterious rash they don't
[2730.24 - 2734.40] know the cause
[2731.20 - 2736.96] true cause unknown they just named it
[2734.40 - 2738.40] maybe they didn't name your ash but it's
[2736.96 - 2740.40] all the same in the sense
[2738.40 - 2741.84] meaning all the same in the sense of
[2740.40 - 2744.08] they're all mysterious
[2741.84 - 2746.48] really important to know this is how the
[2744.08 - 2748.56] industry has tricked everybody out
[2746.48 - 2750.88] they give a name for something if enough
[2748.56 - 2752.08] people have a certain identifiable
[2750.88 - 2753.76] relation to a rash
[2752.08 - 2754.96] then they put a name on it but they
[2753.76 - 2755.84] don't know what causes it so it's
[2754.96 - 2758.72] mysterious
[2755.84 - 2759.68] mystery illness is every diagnosis
[2758.72 - 2761.76] practically
[2759.68 - 2762.96] and and every autoimmune diagnosis is
[2761.76 - 2766.08] mystery illness every
[2762.96 - 2768.32] all of that so some mysterious rashes so
[2766.08 - 2769.92] i mean if i had a mysterious rash i
[2768.32 - 2771.12] would just be like looking in here and
[2769.92 - 2773.20] being like okay
[2771.12 - 2774.80] uh first of all he's got the street cred
[2773.20 - 2776.72] because thousands upon thousands of
[2774.80 - 2778.40] healing stories on rashes and
[2776.72 - 2779.92] eczema and psoriasis and all that stuff
[2778.40 - 2780.96] and what did they do well they did some
[2779.92 - 2782.72] celery juice they
[2780.96 - 2784.56] they stayed strong with that they got
[2782.72 - 2785.68] rid of eggs and dairy products they got
[2784.56 - 2787.60] rid of gluten right
[2785.68 - 2788.88] and they started bringing leafy greens
[2787.60 - 2790.48] like the spinach soup
[2788.88 - 2792.08] they started bringing wild foods like
[2790.48 - 2794.72] the wild blueberries
[2792.08 - 2796.56] um and they started to learn how to heal
[2794.72 - 2798.08] using like the herbal medicine right
[2796.56 - 2800.64] here the celery juice
[2798.08 - 2802.40] and they started getting minerals they
[2800.64 - 2803.92] started learning how to use b12 they
[2802.40 - 2805.36] started learning how to do these things
[2803.92 - 2807.28] and in the back of the book i talk about
[2805.36 - 2809.60] eczema psoriasis and other skin rashes
[2807.28 - 2809.60] and stuff
[2810.88 - 2816.24] so um
[2813.92 - 2817.52] gabrielle hi anthony what about tingling
[2816.24 - 2819.84] in my limbs
[2817.52 - 2821.76] after every shower thanks very much
[2819.84 - 2823.76] tingling and limbs after every shower
[2821.76 - 2825.28] what that is is when the shower's
[2823.76 - 2827.68] hitting you
[2825.28 - 2829.52] it's hitting your nerves this is why
[2827.68 - 2830.32] when people have any nerve sensitivities
[2829.52 - 2834.24] that
[2830.32 - 2837.28] if some people get so so
[2834.24 - 2839.76] sick with different neurological stuff
[2837.28 - 2840.88] that they can't take a shower the water
[2839.76 - 2843.68] hitting them
[2840.88 - 2844.32] will make them pass out or make them hit
[2843.68 - 2846.96] the floor
[2844.32 - 2848.96] or really hurt their nerves or cause
[2846.96 - 2850.80] lots of numbness and tingles
[2848.96 - 2852.80] you're just having a little tingling
[2850.80 - 2853.52] going on so what that just means is you
[2852.80 - 2854.80] got a little bit
[2853.52 - 2856.96] your phrenic nerves are a little
[2854.80 - 2859.76] sensitive that's all that is
[2856.96 - 2860.80] i mean you know i i talked to recently a
[2859.76 - 2863.52] practitioner who's a
[2860.80 - 2865.28] naturopath and this naturopath i mean i
[2863.52 - 2866.96] talk to mainly medical doctors
[2865.28 - 2868.64] but i do talk to some naturopaths in
[2866.96 - 2870.80] between it all um
[2868.64 - 2872.08] and i stuck in this naturopath that
[2870.80 - 2874.56] reached out to me
[2872.08 - 2876.80] and the they were talking about this
[2874.56 - 2879.20] very thing about taking a shower
[2876.80 - 2880.24] feeling weird sensations feeling tingles
[2879.20 - 2881.68] and stuff like that
[2880.24 - 2883.04] and i was explaining to this naturopath
[2881.68 - 2884.24] that people have a lot of sensitive
[2883.04 - 2887.28] nerves they have sensitive
[2884.24 - 2888.80] frantic nerves you know all kinds of
[2887.28 - 2889.60] different nerves get sensitive and the
[2888.80 - 2892.80] shower is
[2889.60 - 2894.72] hitting the muscles it's hitting the
[2892.80 - 2896.72] muscles and the heat's getting in
[2894.72 - 2898.08] and what happens is your nerves are
[2896.72 - 2900.24] coming out they're coming
[2898.08 - 2901.44] out into muscle in other places the
[2900.24 - 2902.16] nerves are going into all kinds of
[2901.44 - 2903.20] places
[2902.16 - 2905.04] it means they're a little bit
[2903.20 - 2906.80] hypersensitive a little extra sensitive
[2905.04 - 2908.16] do you have any anxiety along with that
[2906.80 - 2910.16] do you have other things going on with
[2908.16 - 2911.92] that um
[2910.16 - 2914.08] i mean i personally if i was dealing
[2911.92 - 2916.00] with that i would be like no gluten no
[2914.08 - 2917.76] caffeine never the caffeine
[2916.00 - 2919.60] no eggs no dairy products move that
[2917.76 - 2921.36] stuff completely out for now
[2919.60 - 2923.60] um i bring in a little bit more fruit in
[2921.36 - 2924.64] my diet i bring in some leafy greens in
[2923.60 - 2926.24] my diet
[2924.64 - 2928.24] so i would start doing that maybe do a
[2926.24 - 2929.60] little celery juice so i mean that's
[2928.24 - 2932.08] what i would do to start with
[2929.60 - 2933.12] and and and personally what i would do
[2932.08 - 2935.28] if i was going through that i would
[2933.12 - 2937.04] bring in some b12 the right kind of b12
[2935.28 - 2939.76] to learn about that in medical medium
[2937.04 - 2942.40] information but i would bring that in
[2939.76 - 2944.88] and that's where i would start if i was
[2942.40 - 2944.88] doing that
[2945.92 - 2948.16] so
[2953.12 - 2957.44] so tanya says literally all these
[2955.92 - 2959.28] questions you guys are asking

[2982.84 - 2987.92] tanya
[2984.32 - 2990.48] okay so there's a question of there's
[2987.92 - 2991.04] there's a question of i have all the
[2990.48 - 2993.12] books
[2991.04 - 2995.28] bought all of them but you don't talk
[2993.12 - 2997.04] about durkheam's disease
[2995.28 - 2998.80] okay so there's that question right
[2997.04 - 3001.92] there and lisa
[2998.80 - 3006.00] i'm glad you asked that question okay um
[3001.92 - 3008.00] the the fatty lipomas and
[3006.00 - 3009.76] and other cis other symptoms that kind
[3008.00 - 3010.32] of like go along with it and stuff like
[3009.76 - 3013.12] that
[3010.32 - 3013.52] but you know the thing is with that is
[3013.12 - 3015.20] with
[3013.52 - 3017.12] okay first of all fatty lipomas fatty
[3015.20 - 3020.08] lipomas i do talk about that in
[3017.12 - 3021.92] in these lives many times and what
[3020.08 - 3023.12] happens with the fatty lipoma it tends
[3021.92 - 3025.28] to grow these
[3023.12 - 3026.24] in order for the lipoma to grow it has
[3025.28 - 3028.00] to grow the
[3026.24 - 3029.36] uh these blood vessels so the blood
[3028.00 - 3030.56] vessels grow out of it and those blood
[3029.36 - 3032.56] vessels need to be
[3030.56 - 3033.84] need to drop food they need to drop
[3032.56 - 3035.84] nutrients so
[3033.84 - 3037.04] i asked them i get asked about lipomas
[3035.84 - 3039.36] all the time
[3037.04 - 3040.88] and and like how do you stop them from
[3039.36 - 3041.44] growing why are they growing what's
[3040.88 - 3043.92] going on
[3041.44 - 3044.72] and they grow because they're eating
[3043.92 - 3047.68] something
[3044.72 - 3048.24] they actually do feed it's the craziest
[3047.68 - 3050.32] thing
[3048.24 - 3051.52] and i know it sounds crazy but they have
[3050.32 - 3053.12] because i talk to surgeons they're like
[3051.52 - 3055.36] well we got to kind of cut their roots
[3053.12 - 3057.28] when we come when we remove lipomas
[3055.36 - 3059.76] we have to kind of like sniff their
[3057.28 - 3061.44] little roots and
[3059.76 - 3063.12] nobody knows that it's the craziest
[3061.44 - 3063.68] thing how nobody knows this information
[3063.12 - 3067.12] but
[3063.68 - 3070.32] those little roots drop nutrients and if
[3067.12 - 3072.24] it feeds the lipoma and what this
[3070.32 - 3075.20] lipomas like to eat
[3072.24 - 3076.88] they love eggs they love eggs like
[3075.20 - 3078.72] homers grow bigger and bigger when you
[3076.88 - 3081.44] eat more eggs eggs eggs
[3078.72 - 3082.64] that i know and they do also like some
[3081.44 - 3084.64] dairy products
[3082.64 - 3086.08] they do like that they don't care about
[3084.64 - 3086.96] gluten like homers don't care about
[3086.08 - 3088.24] gluten i mean
[3086.96 - 3090.16] you may not want to be on gluten for
[3088.24 - 3092.08] other reasons that i talk about but
[3090.16 - 3093.68] lipomas don't care about about gluten
[3092.08 - 3096.64] okay but they love
[3093.68 - 3097.60] dairy products they love eggs really
[3096.64 - 3100.24] important to know
[3097.60 - 3101.20] okay right there and and that alone you
[3100.24 - 3103.28] can be proactive
[3101.20 - 3104.24] and if you're eating a lot of fat in
[3103.28 - 3108.00] your diet
[3104.24 - 3110.72] okay so fatty tumors
[3108.00 - 3111.84] yeah um drop down the fats that's
[3110.72 - 3114.48] another thing too
[3111.84 - 3116.24] and and that's that's something all on
[3114.48 - 3117.68] its own
[3116.24 - 3119.44] but really it takes a virus to make a
[3117.68 - 3122.72] lipo
[3119.44 - 3124.16] and look what i would do is dirkham's
[3122.72 - 3126.16] disease it's like what's all the
[3124.16 - 3127.76] symptoms of dirkham's disease
[3126.16 - 3129.68] what are the symptoms and i would
[3127.76 - 3132.80] individually look at the symptoms
[3129.68 - 3135.04] because it doesn't mean durkheim's is
[3132.80 - 3137.04] the like they name it that but they
[3135.04 - 3138.40] don't understand the symptoms in between
[3137.04 - 3140.72] it all so you take a look at you
[3138.40 - 3142.40] identify the symptoms on their own when
[3140.72 - 3143.04] you identify their sense so when you say
[3142.40 - 3144.48] look
[3143.04 - 3146.32] you talk about all these other things in
[3144.48 - 3149.76] the books but you don't talk about that
[3146.32 - 3151.44] well no you take the specific symptom
[3149.76 - 3152.96] and you take that specific symptom and
[3151.44 - 3155.04] you go on the back of the book and you
[3152.96 - 3156.24] line it up and then yeah it turns out i
[3155.04 - 3158.56] did talk about that
[3156.24 - 3160.40] in fact now you know the cause of it so
[3158.56 - 3162.16] it's really important
[3160.40 - 3164.48] so rene says why is my hashimoto's
[3162.16 - 3166.32] thyroiditis affecting me neurologically
[3164.48 - 3167.76] really awesome question incredible
[3166.32 - 3169.68] question for tonight
[3167.76 - 3172.00] my neurologist can't give me an answer
[3169.68 - 3177.04] because hashimoto's thyroiditis
[3172.00 - 3178.56] is the third stage of epstein-barr
[3177.04 - 3181.52] and you'll learn that in the medical
[3178.56 - 3184.56] medium books so hashimoto's thyroiditis
[3181.52 - 3185.92] is the third stage of epstein-barr so
[3184.56 - 3187.60] what happens is
[3185.92 - 3189.52] the first stage of epstein-barr is when
[3187.60 - 3191.68] you get infected by it so
[3189.52 - 3193.92] mononucleosis it's not mononucleosis but
[3191.68 - 3194.64] it's pre-mononucleosis you get infected
[3193.92 - 3196.16] by it
[3194.64 - 3198.72] it sits around in your system a little
[3196.16 - 3200.40] bit and then it kind of camps out
[3198.72 - 3202.08] and then the second stage of
[3200.40 - 3204.88] epstein-barr is
[3202.08 - 3206.16] boom mononucleosis it goes into war with
[3204.88 - 3208.80] your immune system
[3206.16 - 3210.72] so it means you had mono whether you
[3208.80 - 3212.08] realized it or not one time in your life
[3210.72 - 3214.72] going all the way back
[3212.08 - 3215.76] and then the third stage after it sits
[3214.72 - 3217.60] in the liver
[3215.76 - 3219.76] after mononucleosis it goes and hides
[3217.60 - 3221.12] itself in the liver it leaves the liver
[3219.76 - 3224.16] in the third stage
[3221.12 - 3226.96] and goes to your thyroid so
[3224.16 - 3227.44] hashimoto's thyroiditis is epstein-barr
[3226.96 - 3231.12] stage
[3227.44 - 3232.96] three and and anything thyroid related
[3231.12 - 3233.76] hypothyroidism hypothyroidism is
[3232.96 - 3235.52] epstein-barr
[3233.76 - 3237.44] stage three this isn't research in
[3235.52 - 3238.80] science this is a head of research in
[3237.44 - 3240.00] science doctors tell me all the time
[3238.80 - 3241.68] that medical media book
[3240.00 - 3243.04] information is way ahead of research and
[3241.68 - 3244.40] science that's why i talk to have to
[3243.04 - 3246.08] talk to doctors every day
[3244.40 - 3248.48] this is a medical textbook so the
[3246.08 - 3250.16] information's in here now
[3248.48 - 3252.00] and you can't get that anywhere else
[3250.16 - 3254.96] this information doesn't exist it's just
[3252.00 - 3256.40] the circuit is how to live longer uh how
[3254.96 - 3259.76] to anti-age uh
[3256.40 - 3260.24] telomeres um top five foods that are
[3259.76 - 3262.32] great
[3260.24 - 3264.16] top five foods to help you live longer
[3262.32 - 3265.92] uh be at your beth i mean
[3264.16 - 3267.52] it's like rhetoric out there between the
[3265.92 - 3269.60] plant-based books and
[3267.52 - 3271.28] the paleo-based books and the circuit
[3269.60 - 3272.88] and the podcast it's like
[3271.28 - 3274.32] none of it addresses all this real
[3272.88 - 3275.84] information it's only gonna
[3274.32 - 3277.20] it's only mm info but they'll take
[3275.84 - 3278.64] little pieces out there and sound like
[3277.20 - 3280.00] they're really smart and not cited back
[3278.64 - 3280.80] to medical medium information it's
[3280.00 - 3282.24] actually funny
[3280.80 - 3284.16] because i'm discriminated against
[3282.24 - 3287.36] because of where i get the info from
[3284.16 - 3288.96] um so but the point is is that that
[3287.36 - 3291.12] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[3288.96 - 3293.44] that's of the epstein-barr viral
[3291.12 - 3294.64] infection at stage three epstein-barr
[3293.44 - 3296.56] but here's the thing
[3294.64 - 3297.84] stage four i've seen bar is it stays in
[3296.56 - 3299.28] the thyroid but then it leaves the
[3297.84 - 3300.24] thyroid and it starts to aggravate
[3299.28 - 3302.88] nerves
[3300.24 - 3303.36] so that's epstein-barr so go to your
[3302.88 - 3305.92] doctor
[3303.36 - 3307.20] talk to your doctor ask them hey um
[3305.92 - 3307.92] there's a lot of doctors that use these
[3307.20 - 3309.44] books or in the
[3307.92 - 3311.20] in their that's the whole point they're
[3309.44 - 3312.24] in their doctor's offices then they know
[3311.20 - 3314.96] why
[3312.24 - 3316.56] um people have hashimoto's thyroiditis
[3314.96 - 3318.16] now they know it's epstein-barr
[3316.56 - 3319.60] then you can start looking into it what
[3318.16 - 3322.24] can you do all this stuff talk to your
[3319.60 - 3322.24] doctor about it
[3323.36 - 3332.56] so he can learn or she can learn um
[3328.56 - 3334.32] let's see lacrecia is there anything you
[3332.56 - 3335.68] recommend besides celery juice for
[3334.32 - 3339.68] weight loss i
[3335.68 - 3343.44] am periodic patient and electric patient
[3339.68 - 3346.80] and they push protein
[3343.44 - 3348.56] is a vegan diet best i also have cfs and
[3346.80 - 3350.56] fibromyalgia well first of all you got
[3348.56 - 3352.64] if you have the cfs the chronic fatigue
[3350.56 - 3353.12] syndrome and the fibrobiology you
[3352.64 - 3355.36] already
[3353.12 - 3357.12] are identifying one thing you have going
[3355.36 - 3358.64] on so when you look at the true cause
[3357.12 - 3360.88] you learn that that's viral so that's
[3358.64 - 3363.52] one thing right there okay and yes
[3360.88 - 3364.48] you can you can do lots for weight is is
[3363.52 - 3367.20] what you can do
[3364.48 - 3369.28] you there's lots of information like in
[3367.20 - 3371.04] cleanse the heel there's a whole weight
[3369.28 - 3372.72] weight loss weight gain weight loss
[3371.04 - 3374.16] information it's packed in here there's
[3372.72 - 3376.80] a protocol in here for that
[3374.16 - 3378.16] there's even in the back um there's a
[3376.80 - 3380.16] protocol back there
[3378.16 - 3381.84] it's really about lowering fats so
[3380.16 - 3383.60] whether you're animal protein
[3381.84 - 3385.44] or you're plant-based it's about
[3383.60 - 3387.44] lowering fats if you want to be
[3385.44 - 3389.04] plant-based yes you can be plant-based
[3387.44 - 3389.52] and then you can figure out how to do it
[3389.04 - 3391.92] like
[3389.52 - 3392.88] if i had that condition like me
[3391.92 - 3394.96] personally
[3392.88 - 3396.40] anthony william had that condition i
[3394.96 - 3398.64] would do like
[3396.40 - 3400.08] the mono eating i would go into the mono
[3398.64 - 3400.48] eating right here so the cleanse is in
[3400.08 - 3401.84] here
[3400.48 - 3403.52] and i would get comfortable with one and
[3401.84 - 3404.00] see how it's working for me that's what
[3403.52 - 3406.40] i would do
[3404.00 - 3407.60] i'd probably be doing the potato one
[3406.40 - 3409.76] personally for me
[3407.60 - 3411.44] or maybe papaya banana one with the
[3409.76 - 3412.56] celery juice and the lettuce and so
[3411.44 - 3414.56] forth but
[3412.56 - 3416.40] that's something i would try a little
[3414.56 - 3418.72] bit or you can even do something even
[3416.40 - 3421.12] just the morning cleanse which is so
[3418.72 - 3422.00] so easy and simple and it reduces your
[3421.12 - 3424.16] fats
[3422.00 - 3425.04] so that when your fats are down that can
[3424.16 - 3427.12] help all
[3425.04 - 3429.04] like that all on on its own right there
[3427.12 - 3430.96] and then the weight can start going down
[3429.04 - 3432.56] so yeah and if you if you want to do
[3430.96 - 3434.64] animal proteins
[3432.56 - 3436.24] keep keep the fats low keep them down if
[3434.64 - 3436.80] you want to be plant-based keep the fats
[3436.24 - 3439.36] low
[3436.80 - 3440.96] because then the liver can recoup and
[3439.36 - 3442.48] you can start losing weight and do your
[3440.96 - 3444.84] celery juice and do it all like you're
[3442.48 - 3447.84] cleaning up the liver so it's really
[3444.84 - 3447.84] important
[3449.52 - 3451.92] um
[3452.16 - 3458.72] [Music]
[3456.32 - 3460.08] sand you gotta inguinal hernia so the
[3458.72 - 3462.48] whole thing with that is
[3460.08 - 3463.28] it's about reducing that it's it's about
[3462.48 - 3465.84] you the thing is
[3463.28 - 3466.88] is that don't overeat if i had that i
[3465.84 - 3468.80] wouldn't overeat
[3466.88 - 3470.16] i just wouldn't that's one of the keys i
[3468.80 - 3471.60] talked to doctors all the time about
[3470.16 - 3474.24] this they asked me about this
[3471.60 - 3475.92] and that's the first thing i would do is
[3474.24 - 3476.64] you just don't overeat that's a key
[3475.92 - 3478.80] right there
[3476.64 - 3479.76] so the muscle wall weakness if you
[3478.80 - 3482.24] overeat
[3479.76 - 3483.84] and you're doing big meals all at once
[3482.24 - 3485.68] you can pop a cork
[3483.84 - 3486.88] and that can happen okay you don't want
[3485.68 - 3488.72] to pop a cork
[3486.88 - 3490.40] and so it's it's you want to keep your
[3488.72 - 3492.24] meals like
[3490.40 - 3493.92] you know you can do little meals all day
[3492.24 - 3495.92] long however you want to do it
[3493.92 - 3497.36] um i mean that's that's that's the
[3495.92 - 3499.52] safest way to go
[3497.36 - 3501.60] not eat like three big meals or one big
[3499.52 - 3502.96] meal and stuff yourself because then you
[3501.60 - 3504.80] put all this pressure
[3502.96 - 3506.48] if you get stuffed you put all this
[3504.80 - 3508.24] pressure and then that puts pressure
[3506.48 - 3510.56] up against the intestinal tract going
[3508.24 - 3517.84] into the stomach wall lining
[3510.56 - 3517.84] so um so that that's right there
[3518.40 - 3523.92] um so aaliyah what if you have such a
[3521.92 - 3525.60] wide range of symptoms that you fall
[3523.92 - 3527.12] into so many categories
[3525.60 - 3529.44] where do you start what's your more
[3527.12 - 3532.48] annoying symptom what's your second
[3529.44 - 3533.76] most annoying symptom um aaliyah like i
[3532.48 - 3535.44] would go into cleanse to heal
[3533.76 - 3536.96] get the book out of the library for free
[3535.44 - 3538.56] if you want go back
[3536.96 - 3540.24] go back to the symptoms and conditions
[3538.56 - 3542.80] section and look for your
[3540.24 - 3543.68] like more annoying symptoms and then you
[3542.80 - 3546.00] see
[3543.68 - 3546.88] that if you address that annoying
[3546.00 - 3549.44] symptom
[3546.88 - 3549.92] or one of them your second most annoying
[3549.44 - 3551.68] symptom
[3549.92 - 3553.20] your third most annoying symptom kind of
[3551.68 - 3555.84] go to those if you want
[3553.20 - 3556.48] address them and what you'll find or
[3555.84 - 3558.32] address
[3556.48 - 3560.40] two symptoms but what you'll find is all
[3558.32 - 3563.52] of a sudden as you're addressing that
[3560.40 - 3565.44] other symptoms start to disappear and
[3563.52 - 3567.28] start to ease off and that's that's how
[3565.44 - 3573.28] i would handle it
[3567.28 - 3577.68] if that was me
[3573.28 - 3577.68] so you guys are amazing um

[3649.84 - 3652.48] you're even better and you keep on going
[3651.28 - 3653.92] up the ladder to healing
[3652.48 - 3656.08] it happens with a lot of people who are
[3653.92 - 3658.48] seriously sick but you take one step at
[3656.08 - 3660.64] a time i know many of you guys are on
[3658.48 - 3662.16] mattress island and you're struggling
[3660.64 - 3664.88] because you spend a lot of time
[3662.16 - 3666.08] in bed and all of that and you know i
[3664.88 - 3668.32] just want to read one quote out of
[3666.08 - 3669.52] cleanse the heel right in the back here
[3668.32 - 3671.20] i'm going to cleanse the heels here's a
[3669.52 - 3674.40] quote at the end here in the book i'll
[3671.20 - 3674.40] show you the quote so you know
[3675.44 - 3681.04] right there and it's not survival of the
[3679.76 - 3682.80] fittest
[3681.04 - 3684.72] it's not that people who haven't been
[3682.80 - 3686.48] trapped by chronic symptoms simply
[3684.72 - 3688.80] understand the secrets of life
[3686.48 - 3690.80] better than those who get sick it's
[3688.80 - 3691.44] survival of the ones who come into this
[3690.80 - 3694.40] world less
[3691.44 - 3696.56] toxic with lots of love support and
[3694.40 - 3698.96] resources at the same time
[3696.56 - 3700.48] and then happen to stay that way while
[3698.96 - 3702.24] here on earth
[3700.48 - 3704.24] if you have ever found yourself lying in
[3702.24 - 3706.48] bed scrolling through somebody's feet of
[3704.24 - 3707.52] waterfalls beaches and smoothie bowls
[3706.48 - 3709.44] with peanut butter
[3707.52 - 3711.28] wondering where you went wrong to land
[3709.44 - 3712.80] yourself on your little mattress island
[3711.28 - 3715.52] apart from the world
[3712.80 - 3717.20] know this you didn't go wrong you're not
[3715.52 - 3718.88] faulty you're not less than
[3717.20 - 3721.04] the reality is that outside
[3718.88 - 3723.20] circumstances and inherited poisons and
[3721.04 - 3724.08] pathogens not internal weaknesses
[3723.20 - 3726.80] determine
[3724.08 - 3728.56] the challenges we face and someone who
[3726.80 - 3730.40] has suffered health challenges can
[3728.56 - 3732.24] change their fate what i'm saying is
[3730.40 - 3733.92] if you guys are struggling because you
[3732.24 - 3735.52] got the pathogens you're dealing with
[3733.92 - 3737.36] and just so you know everybody gets sick
[3735.52 - 3738.64] people who don't seem like they get sick
[3737.36 - 3740.40] now and they're young they're strong
[3738.64 - 3742.16] they get sick later everybody gets
[3740.40 - 3743.36] symptoms later everybody gets sick but
[3742.16 - 3745.20] just know
[3743.36 - 3746.96] that you can change your fate when you
[3745.20 - 3748.24] know and understand about the different
[3746.96 - 3750.32] pathogens that you have
[3748.24 - 3752.32] about the different toxins that you have
[3750.32 - 3754.24] and then we can turn that around
[3752.32 - 3755.92] we can take control over health the key
[3754.24 - 3756.88] is to know how prevention and healing
[3755.92 - 3759.76] really work
