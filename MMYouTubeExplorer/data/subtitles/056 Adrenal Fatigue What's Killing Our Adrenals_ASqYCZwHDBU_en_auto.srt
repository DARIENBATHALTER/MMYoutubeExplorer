our adrenaline we get high and for many

18
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:06,040

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,600
price is it your adrenals or you or both

up that they cheered her on they thought

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,320
she did it on purpose but then people

38
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,280
started to realize there was no water

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,680

44
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,920
whatever floats your boat someone likes

45
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,560
to do something they're into something

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,400
whatever floats your boat man whatever

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,440
your boat what it really means is and

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,560
what it really boils down to is where

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,480
and how do you get your adrenaline High

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:49,040
your adrenaline fix where does it come

52
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,120
from what turns you on what are you into

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
people don't realize it but they have

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,120
adrenaline addictions and we take our

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,080
adrenals for granted every day our

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,599
adrenals they do so so much for us and

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,200
in return we don't do a lot for them

58
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:12,840
most people don't do anything for their

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,360
adrenals that's right nothing NADA we're

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,200
not talking about hey we respect our

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
adrenals and that's what we're taught

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,200
every day we're taught the opposite

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,720
we're taught to destroy them in many

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,400
situations we're taught to annihilate

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,159
them but by default we sometimes look

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,560
out for our adrenals but we don't

67
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:39,159
realize it meditation yoga reading a

life related is adrenaline based and our

120
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,360
adrenals help us battle and handle

121
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,080
stress any kind of bad news any kind of

122
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,039
stress put on us it takes adrenaline to

124
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,639

125
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,599
news or you're up against a challenge

126
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,080
that adrenaline being released is

127
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,800
helping you power through it's there to

128
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,240
help you make quick decisions what to do

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,680
where to go and there's different levels

130
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,720
of adrenaline running through your

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,960
system and being released if you're

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,240
under a little bit of stress that's one

133
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,039
level adrenaline's being released it's

134
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,879
helping you to move quick it's helping

135
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,560
you to think fast and then there might

136
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,639
be something else more challenging in

137
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,000
that moment more adrenaline's being

138
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,960
released and that's helping you to get

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,199
on the move to get out of the way to do

140
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,639
something and then there's adrenaline

141
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,639
for everyday projects and jobs chores

142
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,319
things that you're doing so you can

143
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,599
think about what you're doing stay

144
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:22,879
focused get things done and then there's

145
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,680
fight or flight it's either run or fight

146
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,240
something happens there's a fire you

147
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,520
need to hustle you need to think fast

148
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,680
it's an emergency adrenaline's being

149
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,280
released into your bloodstream it's

150
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,520
flooding your central nervous system do

151
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,360
I jump out of this window or do I take

152
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,000
the staircase how do I get out of here

153
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,520
and then you go to the beach you're in

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,400
the ocean you're in the water playing in

155
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,400
the waves and then you get stung by a

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,120
jellyfish you feel an overwhelming

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,879
burning stinging pain on your leg you

158
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,800
don't know what it is at first and then

159
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,680
you realize it's jellyfish and you start

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,440
yelling and frantically trying to swim

161
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,520
out of the ocean it takes a large amount

162
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,400
of adrenaline to service Us in that

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,039
moment to help bolster us so we can move

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,000
and we can think and we can react and we

165
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,800
can feel and a lot of us have a storage

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,879
bin of adrenaline just for this occasion

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,240
just in case something happens a fight

168
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,639
ORF flight moment or a moment when we

169
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
have to become

170
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,000
superhuman like if somebody is changing

171
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,760
their Tire on the side of the road and a

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,719
car falls on them you got to be there

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,360
and that superhuman strength kicks in

174
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,680
that adrenaline you hear them screaming

175
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,599
while the car is on their torso and then

176
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,959
you go and you lift up the car so they

177
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,440
can slide out so let's gain some

178
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,000
perspective here if that happens a car

179
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,200
falls on someone and the person that's

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,040
going to rescue them is a guy who's

181
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,839
about 6'4 has a lot of muscle or just a

182
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,800
guy that's really strong has a lot of

183
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,760
muscle he's got to have a lot of

184
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,120
adrenaline storage he has to have strong

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,399
reserves adrenaline reserves and there's

186
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,720
a good chance he can lift up the car or

187
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,760
the back of a small car just enough for

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,160
somebody to be able to get out but what

189
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,720
if it's a strong muscly guy he looks

190
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,560
good he's got a lot of muscle and he's

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,000
there and he tries to lift the car and

192
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,600
he has weak adrenals weak adrenaline

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,360
reserves it's just not there he just

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,839
doesn't have it in him and he's trying

195
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,120
to lift a car he's not going to be able

196
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,800
to do the job that needs to be done it's

197
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,240
that lack of adrenaline that lack of

198
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,600
adrenal strength that can get you in

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,399
trouble so if a crisis comes and you're

200
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,279
needed it's that lack of adrenal

201
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,600
strength that can get in the way and

202
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,760
make it so that you don't perform like

203
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,040
say somebody else can perform if their

204
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,399
adrenals are strong I've seen this

205
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
happen with bodybuilders they got a

206
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,560
routine they're doing it for years

207
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,640
they're building a lot of muscle they

208
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,959
know what kind of weight they can lift

209
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,920
they know what kind of ground they can

210
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,440
move and then they get severe adrenal

211
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,120
fatigue they get adrenal issues their

212
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,720
adrenals are wasted and then they can't

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,839
do the workouts they used to do they're

214
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,320
dragging they're suffering they're

215
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,880
struggling they're going to the doctors

216
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,079
they don't know what it is they don't

217
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,040
know if it's fatigue chronic fatigue

218
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,800
they don't know if it's depression or

219
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,200
anxiety and the guy is struggling and

220
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,920
slowly they start losing muscle they

221
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,320
can't do what they used to do adrenal

222
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,959
issues are getting in the way and it

223
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,120
takes a little time for them to lose the

224
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,120
muscle because at first they have the

225
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,320
muscle it's there but they just don't

226
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,639
have that inner strength because they

227
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,920
have adrenal issues and then over time

228
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,920
if they can't keep the muscle on by

229
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
using them enough to the capacity of

230
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,920
what they were doing before and that

231
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,839
adrenal issue gets in the way they start

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,560
to slowly waste away wasting muscle away

233
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,720
it's partly why if you've ever heard

234
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,480
this before that sometimes a skinny

235
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Scrappy person tends to be able to do a

236
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,920
lot lift a lot it's like that group of

237
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,560
firefighters there's one that's skinny

238
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,279
and lanky but the guy can lift a heavy

239
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,279
burning log or that construction crew

240
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,560
where you got a skinny lanky guy he's

241
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,720
got muscle he's toned the guy looks good

242
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,720
he can lift a lot of bricks he's known

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,760
for it and then there's a couple of guys

244
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,480
on that same crew one is really built

245
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,800
he's always wondering how that skinny

246
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,720
lanky guy that Scrappy guy can lift all

247
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,160
those bricks when he can't really lift

248
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,079
them as much or as good a reason

249
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,279
adrenaline plays a role in this and then

250
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,160
you ask the skinny Scrappy guy how do

251
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,839
you do it and the guy would be like I

252
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,880
just have a strong back but really it's

253
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,560
more than that it's adrenal reserves

254
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,959
adrenaline strength and we need

255
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,320
adrenaline reserves for that special

256
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,360
moment like giving birth that's when

257
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,680
fight ORF flight happens for a woman

258
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,760
having a baby the baby has to come out

259
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,079
the body knows this the central nervous

260
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,920
system knows this it's time the

261
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,600
reproductive system knows this and

262
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,760
adrenaline is needed when the water

263
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,680
breaks people around a woman will say

264
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,880
stay calm stay calm everybody stay calm

265
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,000
let's get in the car let's get moving

266
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,920
let's get going to the hospital or if

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,120
it's a birth at home okay let's get

268
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,760
things ready because everybody's

269
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,079
freaking out adrenaline is Flowing the

270
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,360
woman's adrenal strength means

271
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,480
everything adrenaline reserves and

272
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,680
adrenal strength can determine if it's

273
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,160
going to be an easy birth or a very

274
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:46,720
arduous labor when the woman pushes with

275
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,959
all her might

276
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,399
pushes really hard with everything she

277
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:57,360
has every bit of inner strength every

278
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,399
cell in her body every single piece of

279
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,880
her existence is in into that one big

280
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,959
huge push and then that other big huge

281
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,800
push to get the baby to move it's

282
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:10,800
adrenaline behind it adrenaline reserves

283
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,399
can determine if it's going to be a

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,360
strong push a very productive push or a

285
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,560
weak push an unproductive push a lot of

286
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,480
emergency C-sections are because of weak

287
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,800
adrenals if the labor really long it's

288
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,440
not the woman that's giving up or it's

289
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,279
not her real physical muscles or

290
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,959
physical body just giving up it's the

291
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,079
lack of adrenaline it's the adrenals

292
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,680
giving up during that child birth which

293
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,279
could lead to an emergency C-section

294
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,000
there are many different reasons why

295
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,880
women can have complicated childbirth

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,399
situations but one of the most common is

297
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,279
weak adrenals but women aren't being

298
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,279
taught to protect their adrenals

299
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,399
strengthen their adrenals and preserve

300
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,680
their adrenals and prepare them prepare

301
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,720
them for childbirth but it's the

302
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,720
opposite women are taught to actually

303
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,920
destroy their adrenal glands caffeine

304
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,680
chocolate coffee tea intermittent

intense triggering movies and the list

313
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,120
goes on and it's not about judging

314
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,839
anybody that's not it at all people can

315
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,480
do what they want they can do what they

316
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,639
like to do remember it's whatever floats

317
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,160
your boat because one day if you hit the

318
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,360
wall if something happens it's good to

319
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,040
know you can do something about it it's

320
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,720
good to have the knowledge in case

321
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
there's something that you're doing that

322
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,519
could be backed off a bit or something

323
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,440
you could do that could really help you

324
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,079
through it to realize hey my adrenals

325
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,920
might be wasted here for example a lot a

326
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,160
lot of people with adrenal fatigue right

327
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,199
now are doing cold plunging and what's

328
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,839
happening is they're feeling like woo

329
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,480
something was refreshed in them

330
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,399
something happened and they feel good

331
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,680
for the moment when they come out but

332
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,320
what's happening is they're on an

333
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,800
adrenaline High what this means is when

334
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,199
you dipping into that cold Icy water

335
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,040
your body started to fight for its life

336
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,600
because of the temperature dropping and

337
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,240
your adrenals released a lot of

338
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,680
adrenaline because it was fight or

339
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,440
flight your adrenals are releasing that

340
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,319
adrenaline to keep your temperature up

341
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,720
your core temperature up because you're

342
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,440
making your core temperature colder what

343
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,360
do you think happened when the Titanic

344
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,120
was going down and everybody was

345
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,079
floating around in that icy cold water

346
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,240
they were freezing to death within

347
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,480
minutes now of course they didn't have

348
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,120
the option to get out of the water and

349
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,160
say hey our cold plunge is done but a

350
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,639
lot of people now are in competitions

351
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,440
and they're trying to stay in there as

352
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,680
long as they can and they're putting

353
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,839
their bodies into severe crisis which

354
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,759
means they're putting their adrenals

355
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,639
into severe crisis is it can become an

356
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,920
addiction you're getting an adrenaline

357
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,240
High the irony nobody knows they're

358
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,279
getting an adrenaline High when they're

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,360
doing cold plunging they have no idea

360
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,199
that that's actually what's happening

361
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,959
but a year down the road or two years

362
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,160
down the road when your adrenals decide

363
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:17,639
to say see you and you're hitting the

364
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,480
wall and you don't know why you can't

365
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,240
even take 10 steps you're going to be

366
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,959
like what happened what was it you're

367
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,720
never going to blame the Cal plunging

368
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,120
ever but you'll blame that piece of

369
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,279
spinach you ate one day and if you're a

370
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,279
woman and you had a really difficult

371
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,600
childbirth really incredibly difficult

372
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,600
childbirth and you don't know why and

373
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,240
you don't know why you're so exhausted

374
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,480
afterwards where for months you just

375
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,079
can't get back to where you were you

376
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,399
won't blame it on all the cold plunging

377
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,920
you were taught to do for the last

378
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,600
couple years you'll blame it on

379
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,000
something entirely different one thing

380
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,800
that chips away at our adrenal glands

381
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
over time is high fat diets the more fat

382
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,639
we eat the more overt fat we eat the

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,720
more adrenaline is released the more

384
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,679
fats we gobble down and eat in our meals

385
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,439
the more adrenaline's getting into our

386
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:11,400
bloodstream and released this is why

387
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,600
when someone goes lowfat for a little

388
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,360
while a healthy lowfat regimen of some

389
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,240
kind they start rebuilding their

390
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,160
adrenals they start getting stronger

391
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,480
over time they start getting replenished

392
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,240
and then they go and eat a lot of fat

393
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,039
like whatever diet they choose whether

394
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,400
it's animal protein or it's plant-based

395
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,080
fat and they end up gobbling down a lot

396
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,559
of fat and they get this euphoric

397
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,799
feeling like whoa like a rush they feel

398
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,720
this energy they feel this Surge and

399
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:43,360
what they don't realize is they just

400
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,520
felt their adrenal glands go explode of

401
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,080
adrenaline to try to help save them from

402
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,960
the amount of fat that's floating in

403
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,200
their bloodstream so they don't have a

404
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,720
heart attack or interrupt the brain

405
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,080
chemistry at all they're feeling that

406
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,480
strength that Euphoria they're feeling

407
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,640
that adrenaline surge because their

408
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,440
adrenals over time restored it restored

409
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,200
and then now the adrenaline's being

410
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,640
released a lot of it the reason why

411
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,320
adrenaline's released into the

412
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,600
bloodstream when you're on a high fat

413
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,720
diet or eating High fats all the time

414
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,320
it's to thin out the blood it's to

415
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,840
protect the heart and before that person

416
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,960
did a lowfat healthy regimen of some

417
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,320
kind there were dog in it they didn't

418
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,960
feel good they felt sick all the time

419
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,440
they felt weak they had low energy they

420
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,720
were struggling with some kind of

421
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,799
condition and then they were slowly

422
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,760
rebuilding back their adrenal glands

423
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,080
getting them stronger so then when they

424
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,440
finally did that pizza whether it was a

425
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,919
vegan pizza or some other kind of pizza

426
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,440
that was loaded with just fat all in and

427
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
on top of it they were like wow I can't

428
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,240
believe how good I feel eating these

429
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,919
three slices of pizza I feel good I feel

430
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,159
strong I feel euphoric what am I doing I

431
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,960
don't have to eat that lowfat anymore I

432
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,280
don't have to do this or that or try to

433
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,600
be healthy I could just go back to this

434
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,760
I was restricted I guess now I can eat

435
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,440
what I want and they take it for granted

436
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,559
they don't know they just restored their

437
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,480
adrenal glands all those weeks or all

438
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,520
those months and then over time they'll

439
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,520
decline their adrenals will decline

440
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,320
again they'll start losing adrenaline

441
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,240
reserves their adrenals will start

442
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,480
losing strength they'll just be eating

443
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,080
anything they want for quite some time

444
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,039
and then when they're hitting the wall

445
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,600
are starting to drag again whether it's

446
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,480
2 years later one year later 3 years

447
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,159
later they're going to be like oh no I

448
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,000
have to do something for myself and they

449
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:35,919
won't even realize what restored their

450
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,600
adrenals to begin with excessive

451
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,200
high-fat diets whether it's plant-based

452
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,840
high-fat diets animal protein high-fat

453
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,679
diets will eventually weaken the adrenal

454
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,960
glands so many people walk around with

455
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,360
undiagnosed adrenal problems and

456
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,600
undiagnosed adrenal fatigue and their

457
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,880
symptoms getting shakes and Tremors or

458
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,640
their symptoms of feeling very weak at

459
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,400
different times of day or brain fog will

460
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,600
be blamed on blood sugar problems

461
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,159
meanwhile if somebody has blood sugar

462
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,039
problems their hypoglycemic hypoglycemic

463
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,799
or any kind of diabetes situation

464
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,400
pre-diabetic and they have adrenal

465
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,760
fatigue both those problems can meld

466
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,200
together causing a lot of confusion and

467
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,240
causing a bigger problem if somebody's

468
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,720
pre-diabetic or they got blood sugar

469
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,640
issues or they're hypoglycemic it's

470
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,640
critical to keep strong a adrenals it's

471
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,559
critical to make sure they restore and

472
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,919
replenish their adrenals and protect

473
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,280
them because if they don't protect their

474
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,400
adrenals and they don't keep them safe

475
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,760
and strong and build up that adrenaline

476
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,559
Reserve then they're going to be

477
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,080
confused all the time they're going to

478
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:48,159
not know what's causing what and what is

479
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,280
this and what is that they just won't

480
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,360
know the brain and body needs blood

481
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,200
sugar glucose that's how we function we

482
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,080
run on sugar without it the brain starts

483
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,520
to die and we can't can't do anything we

484
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,880
can't function we can't live sugar is

485
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,600
what makes the world go around but if we

486
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,240
lose our sugar or glucose if we go

487
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,320
glucose deficient in the bloodstream

488
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,679
guess what takes over

489
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,360
adrenaline people who are intermittent

490
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,880
fasting or on low low carb diets they're

491
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,240
not getting enough sugar enough glucose

492
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,200
to their brain to their body what do

493
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,840
they do they exist on caffeine they rely

494
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,000
on caffeine in all kinds of different

495
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,640
forms to get them through the day while

496
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,320
they're not eating while they're not

497
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,600
getting enough glucose to survive on so

498
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,760
what they're doing is they are taking

499
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,679
from Peter to pay Paul they are actually

500
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,400
using their own adrenaline to compensate

501
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,240
for the lack of sugar the lack of

502
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,240
glucose they're stealing adrenaline from

503
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,400
their adrenals that should have never

504
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,679
been released that should stay in those

505
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,159
adrenals to keep those adrenals strong

506
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,080
they're stealing that adrenaline to

507
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,279
actually work with whatever thing

508
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,240
they're doing that means not eating

509
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:07,000
enough food enough glucose to get by

510
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,159
instead they're relying on caffeine to

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,080
shoot those adrenals to blow out that

512
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,640
adrenaline so they can function do their

513
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,400
appointments and live their life and why

514
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,240
are they low carb or why are they

515
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,400
intermittent fasting because the

516
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,440
high-fat diet didn't work for them to

517
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,320
begin with so they're cutting their

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,520
high-fat diet that never worked they're

519
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,200
cutting it in half or cutting it down to

520
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,760
just a quarter they're starving

521
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,720
themselves for most of the day and still

522
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,480
doing their high-fat diet but only doing

523
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,760
it partially versus doing it every day

524
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,679
all day and they're relying on the

525
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,799
caffeine to get them by to do it and

526
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:46,240
guess who pays the price your adrenals

527
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,360
their adrenals everybody's adrenals our

528
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,520
adrenals need a lot of things to

529
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,679
preserve to restore to replenish a

530
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,880
couple of things that are adrenals need

531
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,320
is glucose sodium and potassium

532
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,159
electrolyte and glucose if you don't

533
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,799
have the glucose and electrolytes in

534
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,640
your bloodstream floating around in your

535
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,880
brain then your adrenals are going to

536
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,159
know about it and they're going to

537
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,480
release adrenaline to compensate and the

538
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,760
more adrenaline released the more

539
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,679
problems we get down the road so we're

540
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,720
not freed just because we're doing

541
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,640
intermittent fasting for years or we're

542
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,600
doing cold plunging for years and we're

543
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,480
going to just be healthy great have

544
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,279
longevity and live forever instead we're

545
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,039
going to have long-term a adrenal and

546
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,039
adrenaline damage that means adrenaline

547
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,039
going into the brain and burning out

548
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,200
neurotransmitter chemicals over time so

549
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,919
all the different adrenaline addictions

550
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,640
many of them we've already mentioned in

551
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,720
this episode over time push the adrenals

552
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,240
over the edge releasing lots of

553
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,120
adrenaline and that adrenaline floating

554
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,200
through the body and the Brain burning

555
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,240
out neurotransmitter chemicals burning

556
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,159
out neurons weakening the nerve sheath

557
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,080
of all the central nervous system and

558
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,760
creating a problem with cranial nerves

559
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,559
and the Vegas nerves upping anxiety as

560
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,480
the years go by creating issues all

561
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
throughout the body including the liver

562
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,919
and even the stomach glands inside the

563
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,840
stomach that creates your gastric acid

564
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:18,039
your hydrochloric acid adrenaline

565
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,039
addictions weaken the central nervous

566
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,840
system bringing people to new types of

567
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,559
symptoms in their lives new confusion

568
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,120
they get lost they don't know why

569
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,880
they're sick they don't know what's

570
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,600
wrong and

571
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,159
long-term adrenaline wastage was behind

572
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,919
a part of it so let's talk a little bit

573
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,720
about restoring your adrenals sleep does

574
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,799
help to restore adrenals but a lot of

575
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,480
people that are under stress they're

576
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,840
under termoil they're under challenges

577
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,880
can't sleep good so it's kind of not

578
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,480
fair to them sleeping would help their

579
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,480
adrenals would help them fend off what

580
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,720
they're up against help protect them but

581
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,880
they can't sleep because of the stress

582
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,240
and challenges so one thing that can

583
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,360
help restore adrenals is resting doesn't

584
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,559
mean you're sleeping it could just mean

585
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,640
you're resting you're laying there with

586
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,799
your eyes closed even if it's for 10

587
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,200
minutes every hour or 10 minutes in the

588
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,120
afternoon or 15 minutes at the end of

589
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,039
the day or midm morning just laying

590
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,039
there resting the nerves also rests the

591
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:29,240
adrenals and helps to restore them

592
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,960
another way to help restore the adrenals

593
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,640
is lowering your overt fats so if you're

594
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,640

595
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,720

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,600
lowering animal protein a little bit or

597
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,000
lowering plant fats that you're also

598
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,919
eating at the same time lowering your

599

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
our mind races as our adrenals stop

700
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,799
snoring and awaken to help us figure out

701
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,279
