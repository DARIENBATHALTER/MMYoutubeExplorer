[0.66 - 6.66] melons are one of my favorite foods
[4.32 - 8.52] one of my favorite fruits when melon
[6.66 - 10.14] season comes around I like to have
[8.52 - 11.64] spirulina with my melon I want to show
[10.14 - 15.68] you how cool this is
[11.64 - 15.68] check this out I'm gonna crack this open
[20.94 - 27.18] here we go and then I'm going to scoop
[24.78 - 29.22] the seeds out
[27.18 - 30.84] just like this
[29.22 - 33.20] I'm gonna try to do it so you guys can
[30.84 - 33.20] see
[36.78 - 41.40] I like melons when they're juicy
[39.00 - 44.58] when they're ripe not too hard and
[41.40 - 47.10] crunchy I will eat a melon if it's like
[44.58 - 49.56] somewhat crunchy
[47.10 - 50.82] but it's not my favorite I like to have
[49.56 - 53.70] them when they're sweet and juicy and
[50.82 - 55.32] ripe but you can also you gotta look out
[53.70 - 57.30] because you might accidentally eat an
[55.32 - 58.80] overripe melon which isn't fun you can
[57.30 - 60.42] taste it where it's kind of fermented
[58.80 - 62.28] and stuff this one's perfect I'm pretty
[60.42 - 64.14] sure I'm gonna put the spoon in and
[62.28 - 66.66] that's the way I like it maybe a little
[64.14 - 68.52] bit more riper than that so here's what
[66.66 - 71.10] I like to do I like to take spirulina
[68.52 - 74.52] and this is emergy spirulina
[71.10 - 76.26] right here I've endorsed this company I
[74.52 - 77.52] work with these guys and there's so many
[76.26 - 80.04] reasons why
[77.52 - 82.74] they're the only ones out there that I
[80.04 - 84.42] can find that don't put anti-caking and
[82.74 - 87.06] anti-binders
[84.42 - 89.46] in here so there's no agents hidden in
[87.06 - 92.04] here that's not disclosed because
[89.46 - 93.90] companies are allowed to stick these
[92.04 - 95.82] anti-caking agents inside their
[93.90 - 98.22] spirulina or inside all their different
[95.82 - 100.08] green powders protein powders and all
[98.22 - 101.76] that and then they won't put it on the
[100.08 - 104.88] label you'll never know you're eating
[101.76 - 108.24] that well these guys don't do it they
[104.88 - 110.10] won't that alone is such a big deal for
[108.24 - 112.68] me because it's scary to know there's
[110.10 - 114.72] things inside your supplements that you
[112.68 - 116.82] don't know about you can't identify you
[114.72 - 118.86] have no idea what it is but it's in
[116.82 - 120.24] there right these guys don't do that so
[118.86 - 124.98] here's what I like to do with Spirulina
[120.24 - 126.72] for years I've been putting spirulina in
[124.98 - 129.72] my melons
[126.72 - 132.36] so what I'll do is I'll just take a
[129.72 - 135.86] little bit like this and spirulina
[132.36 - 135.86] is incredible for you
[136.08 - 140.60] so essential fatty acids are in
[138.12 - 140.60] spirulina
[141.90 - 144.78] just putting some in there there you go
[143.52 - 147.20] so I want to show you what this looks
[144.78 - 147.20] like so
[148.56 - 151.82] I'm gonna put some more
[155.06 - 159.72] beta-carotene
[156.72 - 161.28] essential fatty acids
[159.72 - 163.44] there you go so many nutrients
[161.28 - 166.14] phytochemical compounds
[163.44 - 168.66] so I like to eat it this way I'll take
[166.14 - 170.46] it to my office whatever I'll I'll
[168.66 - 172.20] actually take it to go
[170.46 - 174.48] it can get messy so you got to look out
[172.20 - 176.94] because spirulina can be messy but it's
[174.48 - 178.68] such a powerful
[176.94 - 181.32] incredible
[178.68 - 184.38] source of so many different nutrients
[181.32 - 186.54] look at the color all on its own I mean
[184.38 - 189.00] you know when you see that and the
[186.54 - 191.52] purity of the Bemidji spirulina
[189.00 - 193.50] is unmatched
[191.52 - 196.26] it's not from China it's not sourced
[193.50 - 199.74] from China and you'll see that out there
[196.26 - 201.60] spirulina that stores from China this is
[199.74 - 204.60] from the U.S
[201.60 - 206.64] it's the purest form I've ever seen
[204.60 - 208.32] you can taste it
[206.64 - 210.54] you can see it
[208.32 - 213.78] and if it ever clumps
[210.54 - 215.94] that's fine because you know there's no
[213.78 - 217.20] agents in there stopping it from
[215.94 - 219.36] clumping
[217.20 - 222.00] and that's not a good thing
[219.36 - 224.22] but so if it ever does Clump that's a
[222.00 - 226.80] natural progression of something that's
[224.22 - 228.72] so pure it doesn't have something
[226.80 - 231.96] interfering with it that's not being
[228.72 - 234.24] disclosed on the bottle so anyway you
[231.96 - 237.12] guys that's spirulina inside the melon
[234.24 - 240.62] that's how I eat it I love doing it this
[237.12 - 240.62] way try it sometime
