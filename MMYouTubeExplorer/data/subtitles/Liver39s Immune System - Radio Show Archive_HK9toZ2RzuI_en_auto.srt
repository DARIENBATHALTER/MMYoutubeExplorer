medical Medium you're listening to the

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,720
medical medium radio show where each

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,439
week we talk about the most advanced

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,359
healing information out there ever in

10
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,720
conventional and alternative medicine in

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,239
chronic illness it's important to know

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,480
that because you know we don't discuss

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,320
some of the amazing discoveries in

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,480
science and research with medicine

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
life-saving medicine and everything else

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,719
because we don't need to they're doing

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,399
great but what we need to discuss is

18
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,440
where it's disastrous where it's

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,640
negligent where it's literally falling

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
apart millions of people in the US alone

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,160
are so sick not functioning quality of

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,280
life down the drain all of it all of it

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,640
and that's what we're up against with

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,320
chronic illness and it's only getting

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,600
worse by the Year by the month every

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,239
single year every single decade been

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,320
watching it happen for decades so we

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,640
have to do something about it so we deal

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,119
with the most advanced health

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,920
information today we're talking about

31
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:14,720
the liver's own immune system the

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,119
liver's own immune system very important

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,799
topic unbelievable science and research

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,880
doesn't have a clue to the degree of how

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,360
the liver's immune system works what's

36
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,280
happening inside the liver what's going

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,479
on how it's protecting you and

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,200
everything about it so it's the heroic

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,600
liver this is all about liver rescue

40
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,520
live a rescue book um pick up a copy if

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
you get a chance you can't afford a copy

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
of a book just go to the library and try

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,840
to get it out there soon as you can head

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,240
to the library because you really need

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,200
this and you need to get better and you

46
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,119
need to you just need to get the

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,000
information it's so important to

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,680
understand your immune system that is

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,119
really a critical piece I'm going to

50
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,079
tell you something right now when you

51
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,039
were

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,719
born when you were born your mother's

53
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,360
liver sent a message to your your own

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,360
liver that it could take care of itself

55
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,440
going back thousands of years in the

56
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,319
history of

57
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:15,640
humankind this has been ingrained in who

58
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:18,760
we are as human beings this is how it's

59
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,560
always been it's always been a part of

60
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,000
us our livers we don't offer them a

61
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,560
helping hand we never give them that

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,040
helping hand so as we go through life

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,319
they have to take care of themselves and

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,040
so the knowledge has passed along from

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,560
our mothers to us liver to liver that it

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,239
has to fend for

67
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,080
itself a very important understanding

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,599
right there and and you know it's not

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,680
that it couldn't use any help it does

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,720
need our help our livs do need our help

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,599
without a doubt it does face limitations

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,400
over time as it weakens though and

73
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:02,680
breaks down from lack of our support

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,120
you know when we don't know what the

75
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
liver is doing for us and don't have a

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,519
clue and that's why we're talking about

77
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
the liver's own immune system

78
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,000
personalized immune system the heroic

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,599
liver I call it in Liver

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Rescue you the reason why we're even

81
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,560
doing this is because it's important to

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,400
know about the liver's immune system and

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,720
how it doesn't get outside help from us

84
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,680
ever it needs and deserves its outside

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,680
the outside help from us it really

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,680
does and so as the years go by the

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:38,319
liver's own immune system which is

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,439
literally not understood by research and

89
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,159
science except for just one basic aspect

90
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,239
of it and I'm going to cover into detail

91
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,840
about the the real thing that's going on

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,560
inside our liver get ready to be mind

93
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,480
blown just get ready to be mind

94
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,519
blown and that's

95
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,599
important all of it's important about

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,439
the liver and it's important to actually

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,000
be mind blown too so you can be like hey

98
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,280
I remember that I need to take care of

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,319
my liver

100
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,640
my God I can't believe my liver does

101
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,640
that exactly so then you can actually

102
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,799
you can actually remember it remember

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,840
the information if something's at

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,720
mind-blowing like your liver has six

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,840
types of immune functions meaning like

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,160
six varieties of immune cells only one

107
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,320
is flagged by research and science this

108
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,960
is going to be a fun show it really

109
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,240
is so as the liver loses strength and

110
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,680
grows toxic Through The Years yes our

111
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,160
livers grow toxic through the years

112
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,080
years you better believe it the liver's

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,320
immune system becomes a tattered Army a

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,840
tattered Army out in a field in the

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,120
trenches with holes in the boots and

116
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,600
holes in

117
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,400
socks and and tears in in the in the you

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
know and tears in the uniforms and tears

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,759
in the

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,520
eyes and that's how the liver that's how

121
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,479
the liver and it becomes desperate for

122
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,880
food and water and it's and that's the

123
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,720
whole point low Amun I supply low immune

124
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,639
system and and that's the whole deal we

125
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,800
can shift it of course we can do

126
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,880
something about it we can build the

127
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,120
immune system we can protect ourselves

128
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,639
protect our liver and build our liver's

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,560
immune system up there is a way but

130
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,479
first you need to know your liver has an

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,000
immune system that's the big thing this

132
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,160
is this is revolutionary information

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
mean it's Advanced by 10 20 30 years I

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
don't know maybe even 40 years you know

135
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,400
what when I'm dead down the road just

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,199
gone whatever just

137
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,720
gone you know 50 years down the road

138
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,280
whatever it's going to be this this the

139
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,560
you know maybe science and research will

140
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,080
actually teach people how to take care

141
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,440
of their livers so that this is on the

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,639
radar but wait a minute we're here right

143
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,520
now what does that matter we're here

144
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
right now what am I talking about what

145
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,120
do you mean 50 years down the road

146
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,919
what's today right there you can know

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,120
now how about that you can learn now we

148
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,479
can learn right now as we speak yeah

149
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,080
isn't that exciting that's really

150
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,759
exciting

151
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,759
so okay we can shift this of course and

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,599
we can do something about it we can heal

153
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,639
and avoid disease we can protect the

154
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:18,759
liver its reserves and precious immune

155
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:22,560
system we could change the direction we

156
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,039
can not be sick and recover we can alter

157
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,560
things we can get out of things we could

158
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,880
change our destiny yes we can when you

159
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,680
know what is going on and you need to

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,240
do this is so important to know all of

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,639
it we can change the way our liver works

162
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,360
and our Health Works we need our livers

163
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,560
and our livers need us I'm telling you

164
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,960
right now and knowingness is the biggest

165
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,759
piece of the

166
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,000
puzzle knowingness is the biggest piece

167
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,880
of the

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,520
puzzle while medical denial can keep us

169
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,440
in the dark we can play it

170
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,919
smart by knowing that the liver's immune

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,919
system is always kept in the light of

172
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:10,280
knowing it understands our liver and it

173
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,520
understands what it's doing but we need

174
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,039
to help it in some way you don't think

175
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,879
this is exciting I think this is

176
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,479
exciting that's all I can tell you this

177
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:22,400
is a big this is a big deal if you get

178
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,599
Liver Rescue just I mean just know you

179
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,240
the book is got so much information that

180
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:28,720
it's I can't cover it in a radio show

181
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm talking about the liver's immune

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,680
system it's actually a chapter a whole

183
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,680
section in um in Liver Rescue but I can

184
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,199
only scratch I guess just a couple of

185
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,400
things in there but this is going to be

186
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,120
still incredible if you want to know the

187
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,720
you want to get it all you just got to

188
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,360
make sure you go to the library get a

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
copy if you can't afford one or just go

190
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,120
to Amazon or whatever and get a get a

191
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,280
book wherever you go to get a book go to

192
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,560
the bookstore when you hear about the

193
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,080
term immune system you guys we tend to

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,039
think about our bodies like defense

195
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,680
mechanisms with sniffles runny noses

196
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,159
right don't you think that I mean it's

197
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,599
the whole point and some people think

198
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,400
cancer they think cancer now they're

199
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,440
like immune system cancer you need a

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
good immune system so you don't get

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,680
cancer so some people are thinking that

202
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,120
it's not a lot of people that are going

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,520
there but we often think about runny

204
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,840
noses fever sore throats coughs yeah

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,840
rightfully so you don't want that you

206
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,440
don't want the flu cuz that's what it's

207
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,639
about you don't want the flu protection

208
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,919
against flu is critical like it's a

209
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,879
critical function of the immune system

210
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,919
that's why we we learn as kids take

211
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,720
Vitamin C I think or get a good night's

212
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,279
rest or plenty of fluids I think mommies

213
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,120
are teaching kids that so that's a

214
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:39,680
beautiful thing um but this this this is

215
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,000
just a fraction of what our immune

216
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,080
system is made up of because there's all

217
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,279
these

218
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,040
Invaders I hate going into spooky land I

219
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,920
hate going into spooky land but I have

220
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,640
to there's all these

221
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,959
Invaders there's all these viral things

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,600
going on there's viruses and there's

223
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,760
some bacteria but there's a lot of

224
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,120
viruses that's really what's taking down

225
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,440
people in this country alone never mind

226
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
globally and making it so they can't

227
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,519
function making it so they literally

228
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,040
can't they can't get out of

229
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,600
bed making it so they can brain fog

230
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
giving them everything under the sun I

231
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,399
mean brain fog Just One symptom I'm not

232
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
even talking about migraines headaches

233
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,519
Tremors shakes aches and pains tingles

234
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,600
numbness tentis ringing in the ears

235
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,120
popping in the ears floaters in the eyes

236
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,200
black spots in the eyes white spots in

237
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,959
the eyes weak limbs weak arms weak legs

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,880
feeling of fatigue neurological fatigue

239
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,320
which I actually which comes from me

240
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,839
neurological fatigue just so you know

241
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,800
okay it's just always been fatigue all

242
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,600
these years it's actually neurological

243
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,279
fatigue it's a central nervous system

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,200
being bogged down by neurotoxins by

245
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,959
viruses that's medical medium

246
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,360
information that's Advanced information

247
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:52,079
that's that's been hit in the scene from

248
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,360
from us but the point is is that with

249
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,040
all the different neurological

250
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,519
conditions you can have including hot

251
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,519
flashes which is actually a central

252
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,279
nervous system condition all these with

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,519
all these things you can

254
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,200
have with with you know Focus

255
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,560
concentration everything under the sun

256
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,440
there's viruses that sit behind all of

257
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,240
this so our immune system it's just not

258
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
about the flu it's just not about that

259
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,079
kind of thing it's not about hey you

260
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
know let's let's guard ourselves from

261
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,040
the flu let's not try to get the flu

262
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,320
it's not it's not about that it's about

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
so much more evidence of Invaders isn't

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
always so obvious that's what I mean

265
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,839
it's just not obvious to the doctors

266
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,120
it's not obvious to anyone you even

267
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,399
getting Epstein bar test you're not

268
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,880
going to think your Epstein bar is even

269
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,240
doing

270
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,000
anything because they don't

271
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,440
know viruses and bacteria especially

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,279
viruses wage attacks beneath the surface

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,880
deep in there and they don't create a

274
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,200
lot of noise sometimes they're nice and

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,240
quiet not trying to go into spooky

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,440
spooky land but I I just you know it's

277
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,839
either you you you learn or you don't I

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,519
don't know what else to say I mean we

279
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,200
can be in the dark about everything and

280
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,800
we can be in denial I can't tell you how

281
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,360
many people even on social media they're

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,959
like oh yeah you know you see it out

283
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,279
there and you're just like yeah I got

284
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,200
this these symptoms and everything and

285
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,360
they they don't even know they're viral

286
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,760
they don't even know they're viral they

287
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,120
have no clue they think oh it's just a

288
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,720
gut problem Oh my gut I went to this

289
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,360
functional doctor at whatever think a

290
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,120
gut problem or I think I just get

291
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,399
they're

292
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,760
viral you know you see it there's a lot

293
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,639
of 20-year-olds there's a lot of

294
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,880
whatever 30y olds and they're just you

295
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,519
know they don't know it oh yeah I got

296
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,839
hypothyroidism they don't that that's

297
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
actually Epstein bar causing

298
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,200
hypothyroidism you see it out there it's

299
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,920
unbelievable how far we're still off

300
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,800
about getting the information out there

301
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,760
but these viruses they just sit in there

302
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,600
so viruses bacteria they wage attacks

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,560
far beneath the surface in organs and

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
glands you know that's how it works

305
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,079
fibromyalgia you know multiple sclerosis

306
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,480
rheumatoid arthritis you know you know

307
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,800
ra you know myalgic contis all kinds of

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,120
different things chronic fatigue

309
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,839
syndrome MEC CFS

310
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,320
right you know lupus shingles Lyme

311
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:08,079
disease hashimotos thyroiditis

312
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,320
hypothyroidism and add another hundred

313
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,480
other conditions to

314
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,199
it are all from a virus starting out in

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,360
guess where guess where just make a

316
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:23,279
guess right now um Liver Rescue book um

317
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,519
talking about the liver's immune system

318
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
where do all those conditions where do

319
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,199
they all stem from where do they all

320
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,880
start from right you you're figuring it

321
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,399
out I mean you know probably bunch of

322
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,040
you guys want to smack me in the head

323
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,079
right now probably be like we got it

324
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,279
it's the liver stop we got

325
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,959
it yeah it's the liver it stems there it

326
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,240
starts there that's where it starts more

327
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,560
than we know we rely on the liver's

328
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,720
immune system so much so it's it's

329
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,360
unbelievable how we rely on the liver's

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,880
immune

331
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,839
system it's unbelievable actually

332
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,040
and it protects us from becoming ill the

333
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,639
liver doesn't like viruses and it

334
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,320
doesn't like bacteria either residing in

335
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,279
it so when it can't stop them from

336
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,959
entering it does everything it can to

337
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,760
keep them

338
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,279
contained so viruses enter into the

339
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,560
liver that's how it's

340
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,760
done they enter into the liver and if

341
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,560
the liver can't stop it if the liver's

342
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,040
immune system cannot kill off that bug

343
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,399
cuz the liver's immune system is weak

344
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,920
because guess what we're on high fat

345
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,279
diets all fun in games all those cute

346
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,839
little trendy diets out there I talk

347
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,160
about that in Liver Rescue more than you

348
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,959
guys could ever know I mean wait till

349
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,680
you see it wait till you see it you

350
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,720
won't believe it all the trendy diets

351
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,880
out there all high fat diets keep on

352
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,440
doing it keep on putting out more high

353
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,639
fat diets high protein diets keep on

354
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
doing it I'm not talking about whether

355
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,959
it's animal protein or vegan they're

356
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,480
they're both they go but they both go

357
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,560
high protein high

358
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,800
fat let's keep on doing it out there

359
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,560
yeah you're going to get temporary

360
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,839
results for many of you but yet

361
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,199
everybody's still going to stay sick

362
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,120
down the road I mean you know it's

363
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,240
unbelievable you got to bring down the

364
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,360
fats it weakens the liver so the liver's

365
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,199
immune system cannot stop viral

366
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,600
infections at a chronic long term so

367
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,759
that when you're and when you're in your

368
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,519
20s and you think you're indestructible

369
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,480
and you're in the gym right and you're

370
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,720
on your trendy low carb

371
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,120
diet give it 20 years give it to when

372
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,160
you're 40 40 comes around man it comes

373
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,040
around and when you're sick you got all

374
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,880
these symptoms and craps happening left

375
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
and right it's got two viruses inside

376
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,880
the liver and no one cared and no one

377
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
even knows and no one wants to know and

378
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,079
and whatever's going on and it's just

379
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,680
you know wreaking havoc and then coming

380
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,000
out and hitting the thyroid and giving

381
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,639
you your first case of Hashimoto

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,120
thyroiditis and and everything else

383
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,560
Under the

384
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,000
Sun and you're gaining weight and don't

385
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,880
know why you've been working out eating

386
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,199
good pretty good all these years because

387
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,759
nobody knows how it works it's

388
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,440
unbelievable look it's either you you

389
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,399
know or you don't

390
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
I could I could stop the radio shows I

391
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,680
could stop putting out the books I mean

392
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,320
should I maybe I should maybe I should

393
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,480
shut it all down all of it I'll just go

394
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
find some wooded spot and live in a in

395
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,399
in a

396
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,720
tent

397
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,240
somewhere maybe I'll do that I did it

398
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,240
when I was a

399
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,240
kid okay so let's do Let's do let's do

400
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,040
this let's do this I'm being pretty

401
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,040
silly I'm in a silly mood

402
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,720
today so the bottom line is the livers

403
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,160
get beaten down we rely on them liver's

404
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,959
immune system more than we can possibly

405
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,440
imagine and when the liver can't kill

406
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,480
off because it's been weakened over time

407
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,639
and over the years by the wrong diets

408
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,360
because of just experts not knowing

409
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,839
anything about how the body works and

410
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,000
all these other things when when when

411
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,519
we're under all this stuff or we're

412
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,800
Contracting viruses through

413
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,360
relationships or however it goes and all

414
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,639
these different things that it that we

415
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,880
get it we get these viruses from and

416
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,959
from food and restaurants and everything

417
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,160
else our liver has to work on destroying

418
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,040
it its immune system has to be strong

419
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,800
and it has to be able to annihilate a

420
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,519
bug entering it cuz that's what happens

421
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,720
when you're new relationships all the

422
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,680
time the bugs they get in the mouth and

423
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,600
they get down to the gut and then they

424
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,480
transfer from the gut up the hepatic

425
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,800
portal highway right into the liver

426
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,519
that's how it's

427
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,240
done I mean that's just one way in a

428
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,000
relationship

429
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,160
you know there's a few other ways in a

430
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,079
relationship that it could happen too

431
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,360
but the point is is this is what what

432
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,480
goes on you get in a restaurant you got

433
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,720
all these chefs I mean cross the country

434
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,199
and there's nothing wrong with chefs

435
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,040
it's just their people which just means

436
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:49,000
you got all these people and and they

437
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
got Band-Aids on their hands and they

438
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,040
got you know all kinds of stuff I mean

439
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,560
it's unbelievable and yeah they get cut

440
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,800
and they're still got to work you just

441
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,240
got to wrap it up I've seen I've seen

442
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,839
chefs some of the the best chefs get cut

443
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,400
and they just throw electrical tape on

444
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,959
it on it they just wrap it with

445
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,079
electrical

446
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,360
tape and and throw on yeah they throw on

447
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,480
sometimes a a nit trial glove but at the

448
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,679
same time they still got blood

449
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,360
everywhere and on their hands and they

450
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,039
throw on the Nitro nit trial glove

451
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,160
there's blood on their nit trial glove

452
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,919
but they're still I mean they're trying

453
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,240
to whatever and they throw wrap

454
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,520
electrical tape and they're in they're

455
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,039
In the Heat of the Moment of just trying

456
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,199
to get the food out I mean it's it's

457
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,400
like one of those High pressured

458
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,400
situations stel

459
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,960
and then boom I mean we're eating food

460
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,679
and just got another Epstein bar don't

461
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,120
know why we got chronic fatigue

462
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,120
syndrome again at age

463
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,039
38 either way I'm not trying to scare

464
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,200
the crap out of us too bad basically

465
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:51,080
what I'm doing is the liver it's up to

466
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,919
the liver it's so up to the liver it's

467
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:59,120
so up to the liver to make sure it

468
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,799
destroys a new bug coming

469
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,640
in and if it can't destroy it it locks

470
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:10,760
it up it imprisons

471
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:13,240
it it imprisons it the liver is a

472
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,320
genius it's the

473
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,520
gatekeeper it's

474
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,200
everything it's underestimated it's

475
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,799
disrespected it's disregarded it's

476
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,320
treated badly just like people are

477
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,360
treated by the

478
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,080
way it's

479
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,960
used it's like people get used it's

480
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:40,520
terrible it's all of it and we need to

481
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,799
do something about it we need to do

482
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,880
something so it kind of works like this

483
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,520
let's go into us this is really intense

484
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,559
so I mean get

485
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,440
your you know get yourself ready for

486
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:56,080
this one so here's here's the

487
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,320
deal the liver

488
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,840
contains whatever it can that's possible

489
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,600
possible then it will send killer

490
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:09,240
cells after viruses to keep them at

491
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,240
Bay and they keep them deep guarded in

492
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:14,280
the fabric of the liver so basically

493
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
what these killer cells this is just one

494
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,159
set of killer cells wait till you hear

495
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,960
the rest of this and that's just to keep

496
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,240
it at Bay inside the

497
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,600
liver and this is really important to

498
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,440
know when a virus starts to get out of

499
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,280
control it tries to to leave the depths

500
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,120
of the liver that it's been shoved down

501
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,000
and stored in locked up tries to leave

502
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,200
the depths of the

503
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,520
liver special white blood cells are

504
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:46,200
there to destroy it a different variety

505
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,200
all on its own a different

506
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,360
variety the liver also brings in white

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,679
blood cells

508
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,919
randomly to control viruses living deep

509
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,520
within it like I was saying

510
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,400
before but why doesn't the liver send

511
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,240
its white count to out and out destroy

512
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,080
all viruses and other pathogens in the

513
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,559
liver why doesn't it do

514
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,679
that because the liver is putting

515
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:14,880
tremendous number of resources already

516
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:19,080
into trying to fight off new pathogens

517
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,320
entering by the second by the day by the

518
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,919
week by the

519
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,960
month through the hepatic portal vein

520
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,000
which and and hepatic artery these are

521
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,600
entries into the liver and it's trying

522
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,520
to kill those off as they

523
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,159
enter the liver gets

524
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,679
exhausted so it's trying to kill off

525
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,520
Invaders entering in in the first place

526
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,760
as it's using all of its reserves to try

527
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,120
to stop viruses entering into the

528
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,640
paddock portal vein and Paddock artery

529
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,799
the highways into the into the liver

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,840
that's where all the viruses are

531
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,200
entering that's where they all come in

532
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,799
and your liver's immune system is

533
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,320
sitting there at those

534
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,520
gates at the the gates of that highway

535
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:05,360
right there trying to annihilate

536
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,039
everything that comes in everything so

537
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
when you're at you're at a cocktail

538
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,159
party when you're at a bar or a club and

539
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
you get you drinking out of dirty

540
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,200
glasses and whatever and sharing drinks

541
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,640
and whatever's going on and all of a

542
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
sudden you just picked up a new kind of

543
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,840
strep and that strep goes right in the

544
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,200
gut hasn't really prospered or done

545
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,360
anything yet but it goes right down in

546
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
the gut heads right down in there goes

547
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,400
right through the wall of the intestinal

548
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,840
tract lining that's how it does it goes

549
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
through the wall it literally through

550
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,840
osmosis gets vacuumed through right up

551
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,320
theor hortal veins right through blood

552
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,039
vessels right up to the liver and that

553
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,760
liver of yours sits there with it all

554
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,919
its immune strength and all its immune

555
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,799
system sitting there waiting by the

556
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,600
gates and annihilates the crap out of

557
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,960
that that brand new strep you just

558
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,200
picked up in that club or at the

559
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,919
cocktail party or at your friend's house

560
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,320
or whatever I'm just just you know I

561
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,159
don't know I don't know what people do

562
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,279
these days wherever wherever we can get

563
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,120
anything

564
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,679
or you know or the toilet or some toilet

565
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,440
in some gas station that was just you

566
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:11,799
know festering with a whole bunch of

567
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,720
stuff and some water splashed up yeah

568
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,640
and you know and with that and with that

569
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,679
your liver is literally destroying that

570
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,520
Invader so it's using everything it can

571
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,360
everything it

572
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,559
can I told you this was going to be

573
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,640
intense all right let's cruise along we

574
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,600
got so much to cover it's

575
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,080
ridiculous because the liver is already

576
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
putting out like I said there tremendous

577
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,760
number of resources to trying to do what

578
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,520
exactly what I just said it's doing

579
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,880
protect things from entering into the

580
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,000
portal vein a portal he hepatic artery

581
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,120
all of that and if you don't know what

582
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
that is that's just you know that's

583
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,600
veins coming off of your intestinal

584
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,039
tract

585
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,840
lining that's veins and they all funnel

586
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,080
to the liver into a main Highway hepatic

587
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,200
portal

588
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,360
Highway same thing with arteries the

589
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,200
artery all the blood vessels all to a

590
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,760
main artery a a

591
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,559
highway so that's what the body is doing

592
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,520
is trying to kill those off these are

593
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,480
the immune defenses of the liver the

594
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,080
liver's personalized immune system

595
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,000
that's what this show is about it's a

596
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,360
highly Advanced information for warning

597
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,240
anybody who just tuned in and listen to

598
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,080
the show over again you got to listen to

599
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,000
the show over again I think you know

600
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,559
honestly it's it's it's a shame when

601
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,640
someone just Tunes in halfway in the

602
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,760
show doesn't hear the first half I know

603
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,760
we're all busy but this is about your

604
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,200
health loved ones and everything else

605
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,559
and it's about knowing some important

606
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,360
information much of the sophistication

607
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,760
of the liver's immune system is still

608
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,640
unknown like I said to Medical

609
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,200
communities research and science it's

610
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,000
why you don't hear about it every day in

611
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,360
the world that's the whole

612
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,320
point almost all of it's not known and

613
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,880
that's how it

614
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,320
works and and it's unknown to medical

615
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,080
science and research that your liver's

616
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:03,159
immune system is made up ready of six

617
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:06,080
main units your liver immune system is

618
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:08,240
made up of six main

619
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,880
units I'll give you three of them right

620
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,919
off the top the hepatic vessel white

621
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,880
blood cells okay hepatic portal vein

622
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
white blood cells science of research

623
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,080
doesn't know about this has no clue

624
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,559
these aren't even not even on the radar

625
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,600
not even in any study not even in

626
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,799
anywhere it's Advanced information for

627
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,600
warning you hepatic artery white blood

628
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,679
cells those are three of those units I

629
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,399
just said just now they're the soldiers

630
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,279
that stand watch they stand watch as the

631
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,480
blood enters the liver research and

632
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,880
science just thinks there's some white

633
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,120
blood cells floating around inside the

634
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,880
liver that's about

635
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,360
it that's about it and there's a reason

636
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
I really think there's a reason money's

637
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,120
not going there and I really think

638
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,520
there's a reason why it's understudied

639
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,080
like everything else in chronic illness

640
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,080
but I think with this one I think

641
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,720
there's a big reason because once again

642
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,919
it leads to the fact that the liver is

643
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,240
filled with viruses and and then virus

644
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,679
Es are the cause for all the chronic

645
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,120
illnesses and guess what it's not

646
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:06,120
genetics it's not genetics it never was

647
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:10,120
genetics that why people are sick with

648
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,039
chronic illness it's not the body

649
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:18,000
attacking itself it's a it's a

650
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:20,000
liver filled with a load of viruses try

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,679
to bleep myself and not

652
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,640
swear cuz this stuff will just you know

653
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,520
it'll it'll make you get emotional and

654
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,960
the whole point is is that you know that

655
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,679
we're not supposed to know about like

656
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,080
how viruses make us all sick we're

657
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,760
supposed to kind of stay stupid and then

658
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,559
we get an answer or diagnosis we're like

659
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,120
what our body's attacking itself our

660
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:41,960
body is actually attacking itself so my

661
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,320
body's own immune system is destroying

662
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,320
my thyroid or my body's own immune

663
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,720
system is destroying my skin or

664
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,200
destroying my kidney or my body's own

665
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,760
immune system is making me sick is okay

666
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,360
and and it's genetic oh wait wait

667
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,679
there's information out there now you're

668
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,480
telling me that Epstein bar kind of

669
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,240
plays a role but it's not the cause it's

670
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,799
just a trigger that's another screw up

671
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,760
just look out for all that you see all

672
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,440
these you know these studies and in the

673
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,440
medical medium Community will actually

674
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,320
post them and be like hey look aw was

675
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
right Anthony William was right it is

676
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,159
Epstein bar but when you read the study

677
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,799
they still don't want the truth they're

678
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,000
trying to derail you and trick you

679
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,279
that's the whole thing I talked about

680
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,360
that on a Facebook live they they're

681
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:24,600
doing that because of what we did we

682
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,120
spent years getting the truth out there

683
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,640
and it became a storm it it's raging

684
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,159
through the country alone never mind

685
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,320
globally of the truth that's causing

686
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,559
chronic illness because of the medical

687
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,799
medium book series so then they put out

688
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,159
the bogus studies saying oh well epsteen

689
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,600
bar oh it cause of Hashim Motors cause

690
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,760
of this cause no it's not the thing you

691
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,399
read the article or the or or the

692
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,760
article or you read the study it has

693
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,240
nothing to do with the cause they say

694
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,799
it's genetics and the body's attacking

695
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
itself and they say that it's just

696
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,000
linked it's it's a trigger they think

697
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,919
unbelievable they do that on purpose

698
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,559
that's all done on purpose don't get

699
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,559
fooled by that the truth still isn't

700
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,640
still isn't they they don't want you to

701
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,760
know the truth it's the way it works and

702
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,960
the liver has so much to do so much to

703
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,480
do with it so research research and

704
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,200
science is behind with the liver for a

705
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,520
couple of reasons because it's the

706
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,559
incubation place where all the viruses

707
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,159
go and a lot of viruses are manufactured

708
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:21,880
going all the way

709
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,520
back and they've somehow

710
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,840
escaped many of them stealth viruses

711
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,440
many of the different varieties and the

712
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,640
mutation somehow escaped out some lab

713
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,159
whoa I don't know how they end up in

714
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,200
people but they

715
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,840
do and they incubate inside everybody's

716
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,559
liver no one's taking care of the liver

717
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,600
and then oh the big the big trendy the

718
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,760
trendy guys out there the big fancy

719
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,919
doctors whatever they put out their

720
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,120
books whatever and they want to hang

721
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,559
their hat on something it's all on a

722
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,440
high fat this and a high fat that or a

723
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,880
high protein this and you can see some

724
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
of them are trying to back down that

725
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,399
that little bit and they're like

726
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,519
lowering that bringing in more juices

727
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:56,600
bringing in more fruits and vegetables

728
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,159
oh when did you learn that last year how

729
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,960
about 30 years ago when I was getting

730
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
people out of bed that were out of

731
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,480
wheelchairs it's important to know what

732
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
you need to do it's so critical so

733
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,120
sarcastic today I'm sorry guys I hope

734
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,200
that doesn't turn you off and make you

735
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,679
want to hang up from the

736
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,840
podcast here's the

737
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
deal you just got to you just got to

738
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,159
remember I'm silly too a lot so just

739
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,120
just just bear with me when you're doing

740
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
this for like your whole life since Age

741
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,440
4 you just you got to remember the

742
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,679
medical information that came to me at

743
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,360
age 4567 is the same thing you're

744
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,960
reading in these Advanced books it's 50

745
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,840
years 30 years 20 years 10 years ahead

746
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,399
of its time at age 5 6 7 8 I was getting

747
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,360
the

748
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,559
information that's why there's this

749
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,200
picture of me in the book age four years

750
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,240
old sitting in there there's a reason I

751
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,600
was getting the information that early

752
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:54,840
it was no fun so there's these six six

753
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,679
main units of our liver's immune system

754
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,039
so here's how it works like the padic

755
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,559
portal vein that's the main Highway vein

756
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,519
I was talking about it comes off of the

757
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,840
intestinal tract so as viruses and

758
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,679
bacteria are funneling up into the liver

759
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,600
those white blood cells in the hepatic

760
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,840
portal vein that's one of the highways

761
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,480
those white blood cells monitor the

762
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,320
portal vein itself this is the main

763
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,000
Highway into the liver this is past the

764
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,120
point of any more off ramps or on ramps

765
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,679
actually on ramps sorry about that

766
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,399
there's no more exits this highway ends

767
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,799
up heading did you ever did you ever get

768
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,640
in traffic did you ever drive and you're

769
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,320
like crap I should have gotten off of

770
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,679
that you should have got off in in La

771
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,799
especially in La it's like I should have

772
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,279
gotten off that exit oh my God what did

773
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,320
I do why am I stuck in this for the next

774
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,880
45 minutes now for the next hour and a

775
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,960
half I should have got off that exit or

776
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,600
in New York or wherever I mean it's just

777
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:51,720
crazy or anywhere in the country so so

778
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,360
there's no getting off that that that

779
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,080
that blood is heading up into the liver

780
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,120
through that hepatic portal portal vein

781
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,200
so these white blood cells

782
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,960
they stay they actually act like TSA TSA

783
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,559
at the airport that's what they do as

784
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,919
blood's coming through the hepatic

785
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,640
portal vein it's filled with nutrients

786
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,880
right you know that part I think our

787
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,399
blood is filled with nutrients I think

788
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,720
you guys probably know that there blood

789
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,760
going into the liers filled with

790
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,720
nutrients and poisons lots of poisons

791
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,679
it's filled with both and this is a hot

792
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,360
spot for any kind of troublemakers

793
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,039
trying to make their way inside the

794
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,480
liver like

795
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,960
viruses so they try to actually go in

796
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,760
through that way and the more poison you

797
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,519
have coming in the more your white blood

798
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,640
cells this one part of the six main

799
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,880
units of your immune system can get

800
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,760
derailed as an EBV a new

801
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,480
EBV is is heading up through the hepatic

802
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:54,000
portal vein exactly ready to give

803
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,399
somebody a good chronic fatigue syndrome

804
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,559
I mean you know so right when it's

805
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:00,840
heading up there your white blood cells

806
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,600
so that's one of the troublemakers there

807
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,320
right so it's a troublemaker that virus

808
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,799
very common Troublemaker unbelievable so

809
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,840
it heads up and it comes and here's the

810
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:13,080
thing so all this blood coming through

811
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,639
is coming from your digestive tract it's

812
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,039
unfiltered it's unfiltered the liver has

813
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:19,639
to filter it so whatever you're eating

814
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,799
whatever you're eating if you're eating

815
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:23,159
a high high fat diet which people don't

816
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,360
know they are but they really are they

817
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,799
really are vegans too vegans plant-based

818
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,720
people eating such high fat diets

819
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,080
unbeliev able it's like everything has

820
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,679
just lots of fat in it nut fat in there

821
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,440
whatever kind of fat in there it's it's

822
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,279
incredible vegetarians are really on

823
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,960
high fat diets they're eating eggs

824
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,600
vegetarians are eating

825
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,840
eggs I mean it's unbelievable and so

826
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,559
they're eating all that high fat

827
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,039
everything else around it and and you

828
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,960
know a lot of Keto diets now based based

829
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,159
with eggs and then avocados and then and

830
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,039
they're vegan you know or or or you know

831
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,519
they kind of borderline vegan or

832
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,559
whatever it is they get vegan keto diets

833
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,679
it's just all fat the thing is you can't

834
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,639
be on the vegan keto diet can't exist

835
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,159
because an avocado has sugar in it it's

836
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:10,799
different when you go on a animal

837
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:13,679
protein keto diet that is an actual real

838
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,880
keto diet if you if you there's no such

839
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:19,559
thing as going on a vegan keto diet you

840
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,639
can't they're sugar and nuts they're

841
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,200
sugar and nuts you can't be on a keto

842
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,080
diet all you can be on is just a high

843
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,519
fat diet when when you're vegan fancy

844
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,360
that see that

845
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:36,120
information so because avocados it's 25%

846
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,399
sugar I mean you can't you can't nuts

847
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,880
there's a percentage of sugar in there

848
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,720
so you really can't go

849
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,720
keto um on a vegan diet you just go high

850
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,760
fat with still some sugar so this you

851
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,720
don't get the ketosis Factor you just

852
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,440
high fat diet and you're cutting down

853
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,760
your carbs that's about

854
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,320
it and then the animal

855
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,559
protein if you're doing avocados along

856
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,240
with your animal prote proteins you're

857
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,480
still not even really doing keto anymore

858
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,279
anyway either you're just doing high fat

859
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,000
so the whole keto thing is a bomb it's

860
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,480
not even understood right and then you

861
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,320
got these experts teaching it I don't

862
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,799
even know how it works it's the craziest

863
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,639
thing ever it's crazy it's like whoa

878
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,799
and everything else now I'm into health

879
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,639
and yeah the keto diet's the way to go

880
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,760
you lose a little weight lower your

881
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:51,240
carbs what about everybody that's dying

882
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,320
of chronic illness and all the viruses

883
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,799
that are eating up their bodies and

884
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,080
their livers and their immune systems

885
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,320
and they can't function and they can't

886
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,360
even do anything they can't can't work

887
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,200
they lose everything they lose

888
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,279
everything in their lives and and that

889
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,600
diet ain't going to help got to have the

890
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:05,279
you got to have the truth in your hand

891
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,240
so you can

892
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,320
heal so you know these six main units

893
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,919
one of them is there is waiting at the

894
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,280
portal gate right there it's waiting a

895
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,839
stomp on a bacteria and a virus that's

896
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,200
creating all the illness that's going on

897
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,159
out there but there's so much poison and

898
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,599
there's so many nutrients all combined

899
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,119
coming up that highway from your

900
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,000
intestinal tract unfiltered that can get

901
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,359
derailed pretty easy so that's how it

902
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,440
works and that's that's really a

903
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,599
difficult

904
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,320
situation and then there's hepatic

905
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,560
artery white blood cells that's a whole

906
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,879
another kind so that's your that's

907
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,440
another group hepatic

908
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:45,919
artery white blood cells okay so they're

909
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,040
in these these artery white blood cells

910
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,720
this is where blood is coming in with

911
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,960
high oxygen level so you have to know

912
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:54,320
the difference so with the hepatic

913
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,480
portal vein blood coming in from the

914
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,000
digestive tract there's no oxygen in it

915
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,280
I mean there's a little bit in there not

916
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,440
a lot and and then you got and the

917
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,440
stream is slow it's like

918
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:13,640
slow the stream is not fast at all it's

919
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,640
slow so the hepatic the hepatic artery

920
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,920
those white blood cells they're

921
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,640
stationed at the C circulatory entrance

922
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,040
to the liver this is hepatic artery this

923
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,000
is different this blood is coming to the

924
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,079
heart coming from the heart it is higher

925
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,760
levels of oxygen it's holding and then

926
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,760
the blood that enters from the hepatic

927
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,920
portal vein it's traveling at a higher

928
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,400
velocity than than that I mean you have

929
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,280
to know this this is the big difference

930
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,800
right here if I'm if I'm trying to

931
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,320
trying to remember trying to

932
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,440
remember so it's hepatic artery white

933
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,960
blood cells they're different they're

934
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,839
adapted to a whole different situation

935
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,400
cuz you remember high levels of oxygen

936
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,839
pouring into the

937
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,760
liver that blood's being pumped from the

938
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,680
heart this isn't blood coming from the

939
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,400
digestive tract being sucked in through

940
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,200
the veins up into the liver I was

941
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:10,160
talking about before this is high

942
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,440
flushing ratio pumping blood coming from

943
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,760
the heart entering into the

944
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:21,200
liver okay and these white blood cells

945
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,800
they're adapted to high oxygen levels in

946
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,200
High Extreme blood

947
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,520
flow whereas hepatic portal vein white

948
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,280
blood cells

949
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,839
they can't they can't they they can

950
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,440
survive they can survive in other ways

951
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:37,480
with lack of oxygen they're different

952
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,720
there's there's two different buggies

953
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,839
they're not buggies two different immune

954
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,960
cells two different immune

955
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:49,480
cells one can survive high oxygen and

956
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,760
high blood flow another one can survive

957
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,599
low oxygen and lots of

958
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,760
poison that's the difference that's the

959
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,119
difference right there research in

960
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,240
science I don't know 40 years from now

961
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,119
on this one although they'll still be

962
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,680
studying genetics I forgot and they'll

963
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:07,359
still be you know make you know wanting

964
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,480
everybody to do a genetic test on you

965
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,560
know TV commercials and all that so

966
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,880
looking for your heritage and stuff

967
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,760
they'll still be wanting to do that so

968
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,040
they can collect all your

969
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,480
DNA it's unbelievable so they just play

970
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,480
with it more and more until they like

971
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,280
clone people down the road said they

972
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,920
don't even care about chronic illness

973
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,800
telling you science and research doesn't

974
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
even care about chronic illness they

975
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,440
just don't the people working for them

976
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,880
do they do but they're they're they have

977
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,520
bosses they're all under they're all

978
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,319
under direction or they they're out of a

979
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,800
job so the bottom line

980
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:45,160
is this is how it works so that that

981
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,240
group of of that group of immune cells

982
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,760
that sit in that artery area with high

983
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,280
oxygen highspeed blood flow coming

984
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,599
through

985
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,440
okay they know how to swim

986
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,240
aggressively

987
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,920
they know how to swim aggressively they

988
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,800
can handle it under a microscope if

989
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,520
these immune study if these immune cells

990
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
were ever on the radar of science and

991
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,839
research if they were ever on the radar

992
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,000
if they were ever of even interest in

993
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,000
today's world of

994
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,160
medicine they they first of all science

995
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,880
researcher probably think they're all

996
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,319
the same at first but there's subtle

997
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:25,520
differences that mean everything and

998
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:28,760
that would take years of

999
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,400
study so just the three I'm talking

1000
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,760
about the three the three main units I'm

1001
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,319
even talking about out of the six main

1002
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,119
units right now they're they're

1003
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:38,960
different they're subtly different in so

1004
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,880
many

1005
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,440
ways that's how it works all three of

1006
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,640
these white blood cell types are

1007
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,599
incredible swimmers they all can

1008
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,319
swim they can even go against the

1009
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,560
currents with a rare ability to go

1010
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:57,240
against these currents in such a way to

1011
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,319
pursue guess what pathogen the very

1012
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,760
thing that's keeping everybody sick

1013
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:05,319
that's giving everybody everything from

1014
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,119
acne to ECMO psoriasis to oh my God to

1015
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:08,640
Everything Under the Sun that to all the

1016
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,359
different diseases and illnesses that

1017
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,720
are listed in the liver rescue book to

1018
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,640
everything else in the medical medium

1019
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,680
series that's listed in there thyroid

1020
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,680
problems and then all the different all

1021
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,400
the other different stuff that's in

1022
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,920
there athletes to the highest degree

1023
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,119
these immune cells

1024
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,480
are they have a special

1025
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,480
shape that science and research hasn't

1026
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,319
even yet to discover that allows them to

1027
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:40,000
hover in an area of rushing blood like a

1028
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:43,319
grizzly bear waiting against dangerous

1029
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,960
Rapids to snatch a migrating

1030
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:50,359
salmon I mean come on that's how that's

1031
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,319
how powerful our body is it's incredible

1032
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:53,839
and when a pathogen escapes from these

1033
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:55,680
Secret Service agents cuz that's what

1034
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,079
they're like these secret Ser servant AG

1035
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,280
when a pathogen actually escapes at the

1036
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,920
liver's entry entryways where they are

1037
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,720
they find themselves up against the

1038
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
liver's next Defence which I'm going

1039
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,760
into and these are the other three of

1040
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,040
the six if I think I covered them all

1041
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,079
they're say you know what I hope I

1042
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,240
covered them all already you got to get

1043
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,599
the live rescue book I can't do it all

1044
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,440
in the show this D this show is a little

1045
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,680
bit you know about having fun too we got

1046
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,079
we have to have fun why we're doing it I

1047
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,960
guess it's a little hard to get it all

1048
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:33,119
done so the next defense are these lobu

1049
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,640
white liver lobu cells these are immune

1050
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,280
cells they're personalized

1051
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,000
guards so these

1052
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:46,680
protect parts of the inside of the liver

1053
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,960
so these lobu white blood cells they

1054
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,119
border the capillaries and other blood

1055
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,839
vessels within the liver on the lookout

1056
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,960
for Invaders like Epstein bar that

1057
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,520
escaped and by the way Epstein bar is

1058
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,720
respons responsible for Hepatitis A

1059
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,720
Hepatitis B hepatitis C hepatitis D

1060
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,760
Hepatitis

1061
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:07,240
E just for the

1062
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,520
record as well as also a zillion

1063
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,160
undiscovered autoimmune conditions of

1064
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,560
the liver I know there's not a zillion

1065
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,880
of them I know that but that's what it's

1066
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,280
that's what it's turning out to be

1067
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,280
something

1068
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,280
close so that's that's one that's one

1069
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,680
variety of the immune system right there

1070
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,319
sitting inside the liver so look grade

1071
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,640
viral infections inside the liver that

1072
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,000
go undetected by medical communities

1073
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,440
these white blood cells I was just

1074
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,200
talking about this one this one set of

1075
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,560
our our immune system out of the six

1076
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,280
main units these white blood cells have

1077
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,200
a license to

1078
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,599
kill their job is more difficult than

1079
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,359
the white blood cells that were guarding

1080
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:51,319
the liver's entryways so this liver L

1081
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,520
this liver lob white blood cell that

1082
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:56,920
sits inside the

1083
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,800
liver it has a much more

1084
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,480
difficult

1085
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,480
job than the ones that guarded the

1086
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,560
hepatic portal Highway the veins both

1087
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,000
the veins and the arteries that I was

1088
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,599
talking about

1089
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,680
before so this is an entirely different

1090
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,920
blood cell white blood cell it has a

1091
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,880
license to kill anything that escapes

1092
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,599
and enters the liver this one's way more

1093
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,319
aggressive

1094
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:26,839
too because your liver here's how it

1095
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:29,400
works your liver is your body's

1096
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,760
filter so it can be filled with any

1097
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,720
number of toxins that get in the way of

1098
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,880
white blood cells work so when these

1099
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,319
white blood cells have to do their work

1100
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:41,119
these toxins get in the way all the time

1101
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:42,680
these blood cells have to be stronger

1102
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,960
and even

1103
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,240
better it's like the soldiers on the

1104
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,960
Battleground unable to see clearly from

1105
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,400
the smoke of burning buildings because

1106
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,559
there's so much going on and there's

1107
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,680
heavy metal runoff inside our liver

1108
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,160
there's viral and bacterial waste waste

1109
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,319
from Epstein bar sitting in the liver

1110
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,839
for 20 years just built up and built up

1111
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,400
and built up there's junk in there

1112
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,680
there's all kinds of stuff there's old

1113
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,000
pesticides even DDT is in all of our

1114
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,079
livers you better believe it's there

1115
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
it's still in all the eagles DDT is

1116
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:18,520
still in every single Eagle every single

1117
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,280
Eagle on the planet in the US has DDT in

1118
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:24,280
it the eagle eggs still have DDT in it

1119
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,640
we don't have any DDT in us oh no we

1120
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,280
don't have any DDT in US of course

1121
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,920
every single Eagle does but we

1122
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,480
don't no of course not why would we have

1123
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,160
any in

1124
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,319
us so DDT and other

1125
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,079
troublemakers they muck up the liver

1126
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,000
that's how it works so these these white

1127
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,599
blood cells these

1128
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,640
lobu white blood

1129
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,359
cells have to really figure out how to

1130
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,480
attack these

1131
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:56,200
pathogens it's why keeping the liver

1132
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,200
clean like in Liver Rescue this this

1133
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,640
book Liver Rescue is so healthy and so

1134
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,319
critical it's part of protecting

1135
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,440
yourself from

1136
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:06,000
disease it's not just about liver

1137
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,559
disease forget that it's about every

1138
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,079
single illness you get it's about Lyme

1139
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,640
disease that's liver

1140
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,000
related it's about all these

1141
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,359
things it's about all the these things

1142
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,280
and by the way I've been saying this

1143
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:20,040
just not just from book one medical

1144
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,160
medium the series Lyme disease every

1145
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,280
single person with Lyme disease has

1146
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:26,160
Epstein

1147
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,800
bar I wonder why I wonder why there

1148
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,000
there neurological lime symptoms maybe

1149
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,280
it's Epstein bar it

1150
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,680
is because bacteria doesn't create

1151
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,839
neurological symptoms when is the when

1152
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,440
is the medical community is going to

1153
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,040
wake up to that fact alone and if that

1154
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,400
made you mad about Lyme disease I say

1155
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,760
this every show if I say something about

1156
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,040
Lyme disease because I've been I've been

1157
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,240
whiplashed from it so bad over the years

1158
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,040
if that made you upset get book one read

1159
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,359
the lime chapter learn the truth about

1160
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,760
Lyme disease don't don't stay in denial

1161
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,160
it's important it's important if you

1162
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,480
need need to bring a torch and try to

1163
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,280
burn my apartment down I bring bring

1164
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,480
bring a pitchfork bring a bring shovels

1165
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,079
and bring baseball bats and torches if

1166
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:07,079
you want because I because I said the

1167
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:08,520
truth about Lyme disease if that's what

1168
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,400
you want to

1169
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,480
do okay so it's it's so this is how it's

1170
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,440
so important that these these white

1171
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,880
blood cells really help so bio

1172
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,160
production is one of the top functions

1173
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,040
of your

1174
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,119
liver bod duct white blood cells are

1175
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,559
unknown to research and science and

1176
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,520
they're assigned to watch over the bile

1177
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:34,559
duct system there's an immune cell

1178
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,680
that's protecting your bile duct these

1179
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:38,960
cells are the only part of the immune

1180
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,200
system that could withstand B's harshest

1181
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,040
harsh nature it's an immune white blood

1182
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,400
cell that's not discovered or studied by

1183
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,280
science and research it has a sheath

1184
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:53,359
over it a membrane that could handle the

1185
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:56,680
harsh nature of

1186
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,480
bile it's got a protective C cover

1187
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,760
undiscovered by research and science it

1188
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,520
acts as a shield like a hazmat suit or a

1189
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,240
firefighter's gear the bod duct white

1190
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,599
blood cell looks for passer buyers in

1191
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,079
bile that may cause infection of the

1192
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:14,520
liver and gallbladder and dadum and

1193
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:20,640
intestinal tra that this white blood

1194
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,640
cell can travel upward and invade the

1195
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:31,160
stomach it can travel upward and NAB a

1196
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:33,920
pathogen that slips by that gets out of

1197
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,040
that bile duct it can even travel white

1198
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,359
blood cell will launch itself kamakazi

1199
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,520
attack you got a white blood cell that

1200
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,280
will kill

1201
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:47,280
itself it'll die for you is what it'll

1202
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,760
do it'll launch itself out of the bile

1203
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:55,000
duct into Uncharted Territory into your

1204
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,760
gut knowing it's eventually going to be

1205
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,520
destroyed and and its Shield is going to

1206
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,640
burn off its Shield is going to burn off

1207
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,880
and it's going to be annihilated but

1208
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,359
it's trying to stop a pathogen before it

1209
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:13,119
gets killed off and burned up by too

1210
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:13,119
much bile overtime and hydrochloric

1211
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:18,559
acid and it knows it can't find itself

1212
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,400
back or find its way back once it goes

1213
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,599
into the gut it's going to die

1214
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,480
eventually or get eliminated out of your

1215
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:29,720
stool or wherever it's going to go

1216
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,599
so this so that's how it works you got a

1217
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:34,640
ComiCon you literally got you literally

1218
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,119
got a white blood cell that will kill

1219
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,880
itself for

1220
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,559
you and it'll Follow The Invader as far

1221
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,880
as it can to try to stop

1222
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,839
it by the end of this journey the path

1223
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,839
basically dest ultimately destroys and

1224
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:50,680
kills the bile duct white blood cell I'm

1225
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:53,160
talking about by burning away its

1226
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,160
protective

1227
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:59,480
cover it's suicide mission

1228
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,400
was for pursuing the

1229
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,520
pathogen which is that incredible that's

1230
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,599
your liver so do we still want to hurt

1231
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,520
our liver do we still want to you know I

1232
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,839
mean look we're not educated about

1233
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,880
eating right I get that that's not what

1234
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm up with that you know what I don't

1235
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,520
care I don't care if someone is eating

1236
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,960
fast food and they're not educated about

1237
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,400
their liver or they're not educated

1238
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,760
about what diet they can do they're not

1239
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,400
educated what they should be doing to

1240
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,720
protect themselves in the liver's immune

1241
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,880
system I don't hold anybody I don't

1242
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,720
judge anybody on that on any level I

1243
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,160
don't judge anybody on that you better

1244
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,040
believe it you better believe it life is

1245
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,760
hard you're trying to survive you're

1246
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,200
going to fast food restaurant or you're

1247
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,559
eating wherever at a friend's house or

1248
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,040
you're trying to get your next meal and

1249
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,440
you're trying to just whatever you got

1250
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,240
to do and if you if you're eating if

1251
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,440
you're eating donuts and you're drinking

1252
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,200
whatever and you're doing whatever

1253
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,520
you're doing I I totally get it you know

1254
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:57,040
what pisses me off is when you're this

1255
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,160
Elite SL doctors slash trying to be

1256
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,240
public figure slash writing books and

1257
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,960
articles slash doing whatever and then

1258
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,640
telling people fruit will hurt your

1259
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,240
liver and stay on a high fat High trendy

1260
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,839
high protein diet oh bring in celery

1261
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,720
juice by the way where' that come from

1262
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,040
that came from here we know that medical

1263
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,920
medium that's that's one of those

1264
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,000
jewels and and that bothers me because

1265
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,119
then people get really misdirected and

1266
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,200
now they're on these other diets

1267
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,920
thinking they're still doing something

1268
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,599
for the liver yeah it's a little better

1269
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,280
than it was than if they were doing

1270
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,960
processed foods but let me tell you

1271
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,599
something it's it's not enough we have

1272
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,040
to protect your liver learn how to eat

1273
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:35,359
you're allowed to have some fats you're

1274
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,160
allowed to have some animal protein

1275
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,319
you're allowed to have some fats but you

1276
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,200
got to be cautious and you got to try to

1277
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,920
be careful on that protein tag that

1278
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,400
protein tag will keep you sick and take

1279
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,680
10 years off your life down the road and

1280
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,319
does that matter it matters when you're

1281
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,160
70 and you want it to live to be 80 I'll

1282
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,880
tell you that much it matters greatly it

1283
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:55,119
matters when you lose 15 years off your

1284
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,319
life when you want it to be 80 and you

1285
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:01,160
you lose lose it at

1286
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,599
65 you want it to be 100 but you tanked

1287
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,960
at

1288
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:08,240
80 I don't know it matters and if you're

1289
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:12,799
chronically ill and you wanted to make

1290
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:15,400
it to 60 but you made it to 40 it

1291
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:18,440
matters so it all

1292
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,920
matters so the bottom line is your liver

1293
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,319
has this unbelievable immune system we

1294
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,599
have to take care of

1295
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,559
it and then finally there's this other

1296
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,240
part of the liver's immune system the

1297
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,640
lymphocytes they Patrol the outer region

1298
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,280
of the liver these white blood cells

1299
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,680
tend to stay on the outside of the

1300
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,440
liver and they're like wa they're in the

1301
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,079
Watchtower positions and around the

1302
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,280
lymphatic fil these are the guys that

1303
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,680
are trying to stop all that strep that's

1304
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,520
pounding out of the liver that's coming

1305
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:50,000
out of the liver and going into up up up

1306
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,839
beneath the Derma and getting every

1307
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,559
teenager in trouble with all the

1308
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,599
different acne and the cystic acne and

1309
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:58,760
all the and everybody just everybody

1310
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,359
with acne that's a strep and so these

1311
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,839
lymphatic white blood cells these

1312
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,319
outside ones that are part of the

1313
00:51:02,839 --> 00:51:05,960
liver's immune system that research and

1314
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,400
science aren't aware of yet they're

1315
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,079
trying to actually stop that kind of

1316
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,880
thing including like Epstein bar getting

1317
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:18,440
into the tonsils and causing tonsilitis

1318
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,160
mono and strep and all that other stuff

1319
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,480
that happens I love when someone says I

1320
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,760
just got a casol laringitis it's not you

1321
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,880
know not when they I'm not saying they

1322
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,960
have tonsilitis any when they have

1323
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,000
laryngitis I love that yeah no I just

1324
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,280
got laryngitis it's she's going away she

1325
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,079
been a couple of weeks I went to the

1326
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,280
doctor and gave me an antibiotic or she

1327
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:37,079
gave me an

1328
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:39,599
antibiotic and they get laryngitis you

1329
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:42,680
got laryngitis that's strep or mono or

1330
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,680
both or

1331
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,680
one yep it's a little bit out of strep

1332
00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:52,520
Rano are both bottom line anyway so

1333
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,119
there's these lymphocytes it's part of

1334
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,160
the liver's immune system it tries to

1335
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,200
stop Invaders on the outside going into

1336
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,799
lymphatic vessels heading in there where

1337
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,960
these other lymphocytes are that science

1338
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,079
and research are aware of but those

1339
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,599
aren't part of the liver's immune system

1340
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:08,040
you got your lymphocytes that you

1341
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,640
already have the science research

1342
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,839
already knows about they got them tagged

1343
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,400
they got them they're on the blood work

1344
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:13,920
they're on there you can you can learn

1345
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,920
about them they're no big deal they're

1346
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,920
your lympo your lymphatic lymphocytes

1347
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,599
they're the ones that actually sit

1348
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,520
around your thyroid trying to protect

1349
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,440
you from Epstein bar there entering into

1350
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,119
it I talk about this in thyroid healing

1351
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,079
get the thyroid healing book I got 100

1352
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,839
condition

1353
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,079
and symptoms in there that you wouldn't

1354
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:32,400
believe that that that are part of the

1355
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,480
whole thing with epscene bar and the

1356
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,880
thyroid and everything you want to be

1357
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,319
Epstein bar expert get the thyroid

1358
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,319
healing book honestly that that book is

1359
00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:41,720
that book is unbelievable for that but

1360
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:43,359
anyway the bottom line is the

1361
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,119
lymphocytes that are around the liver

1362
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,839
though those ones are different it's

1363
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,760
part of the six main units I'm talking

1364
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:50,480
about this whole time and those aren't

1365
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,400
discovered yet and those are there to

1366
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,680
try to stop strep or anything else from

1367
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,000
going further out and getting out and

1368
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,520
getting to the the point of causing

1369
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,480
tonsilitis getting to the point of

1370
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,880
causing acne getting to the point of

1371
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:06,119
causing some weird sore throat that just

1372
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,839
burns getting to the point of causing

1373
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,240
all the different fatigue getting to the

1374
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:14,480
point of causing all the brain fog

1375
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:18,079
getting to the point of causing UTI

1376
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,559
utti chronic UTI getting to the point of

1377
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,440
stopping all of

1378
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,760
that so we cover the liver's immune

1379
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,520
system not in its entirety I can't get

1380
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,160
it all done Liver Rescue has way more

1381
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,319
information about it I think I even

1382
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,440
missed one for you out of all of those

1383
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:35,480
we don't have the time and I even missed

1384
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,920
a whole bunch of other stuff about the

1385
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,440
liver's immune system because I can't

1386
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,520
cover all of that it's in the pages of

1387
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:45,000
Liver Rescue pick one up if you get a

1388
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,880
chance whatever go to the bookstore you

1389
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,359
can't pick one up cuz you can't budget
