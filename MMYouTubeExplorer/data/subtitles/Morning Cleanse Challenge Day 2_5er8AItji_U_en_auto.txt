[284.40 - 287.12] insulin resistance we've been talking
[285.84 - 288.48] about lately it's something we'll cover
[287.12 - 290.80] today a little bit too
[288.48 - 292.32] but let's go straight into it you guys
[290.80 - 293.36] an important critical piece of
[292.32 - 295.76] information if you
[293.36 - 297.20] ever get told anywhere anyhow that you
[295.76 - 298.32] don't need to cleanse and your body
[297.20 - 300.88] cleanses itself
[298.32 - 302.40] you just got lied to you just got lied
[300.88 - 305.12] to keep that in mind
[302.40 - 306.64] and and it's not maybe you weren't lied
[305.12 - 309.60] to on purpose
[306.64 - 310.00] but the industry is teaching people to
[309.60 - 311.92] lie
[310.00 - 313.60] to you so you got to keep keep in mind
[311.92 - 316.88] and how that works
[313.60 - 318.48] so the industry itself they stamp out
[316.88 - 320.96] cookies every day and
[318.48 - 322.08] you'll be a nutritionist cookie no you
[320.96 - 323.60] don't need a cleanse
[322.08 - 324.96] you'll be a nutritious cookie all
[323.60 - 326.64] stamped out you'll be a registered
[324.96 - 328.72] dietitian cookie all stamped out
[326.64 - 330.64] no don't need a cleanse don't need to
[328.72 - 332.32] cleanse don't need a cleanse you'll be a
[330.64 - 333.92] functional medicine doctor no don't need
[332.32 - 336.16] a cleanse don't need a cleanse
[333.92 - 337.44] you'll be a conventional md a gp no
[336.16 - 338.00] don't need a cleanse don't need a
[337.44 - 340.16] cleanse no
[338.00 - 341.92] no no they'll stamp you out like cookies
[340.16 - 343.20] i'm gonna get my degree next let me get
[341.92 - 344.64] my degree and have a bunch of letters
[343.20 - 345.84] after it nope you don't need to cleanse
[344.64 - 349.04] you don't need to cleanse
[345.84 - 350.16] and that's how it works and but what
[349.04 - 352.80] happens is
[350.16 - 353.92] you're gonna get in trouble when that
[352.80 - 355.12] you're going to get in trouble because
[353.92 - 359.28] your body needs
[355.12 - 360.40] to clean up and everybody's
[359.28 - 361.92] hear it out there people are worried
[360.40 - 362.40] about the lymphatic system out there
[361.92 - 364.56] right
[362.40 - 366.24] they're worried about lymphatic drainage
[364.56 - 370.16] and lymphatic system
[366.24 - 373.36] you can't clean up the lymphatic system
[370.16 - 374.88] until you clean up the liver really
[373.36 - 377.36] important
[374.88 - 379.36] you can't clean up the lymphatic system
[377.36 - 380.88] until you clean up the liver
[379.36 - 382.40] this body's just falling apart right
[380.88 - 383.76] here on here on me
[382.40 - 387.68] but that's why we're live that's the
[383.76 - 390.08] whole point you can't clean up
[387.68 - 391.12] your lymphatic system unless you clean
[390.08 - 393.60] up the liver
[391.12 - 395.84] you have to clean that up first if you
[393.60 - 397.36] don't clean that up
[395.84 - 399.12] there is no cleaning the lymphatic
[397.36 - 400.80] system there's no cleaning up the
[399.12 - 401.60] lymphatic system really important to
[400.80 - 405.28] know
[401.60 - 408.24] that's how it works and
[405.28 - 411.12] another thing too by the way you can't
[408.24 - 414.24] clean up your brain
[411.12 - 416.16] until you clean up your liver it's
[414.24 - 417.60] another thing too you can't clean your
[416.16 - 420.24] brain up either
[417.60 - 422.00] that's a whole nother point your brain
[420.24 - 424.88] is not supposed to be
[422.00 - 426.00] the filter you guys your brain is not
[424.88 - 428.88] supposed to be the filter
[426.00 - 430.24] but it becomes the filter because our
[428.88 - 434.24] liver stays dirty
[430.24 - 437.36] and sick so our brain becomes a filter
[434.24 - 440.08] it's not supposed to be a filter
[437.36 - 441.28] so everybody walks around dirty brains
[440.08 - 444.40] dirty
[441.28 - 447.28] gross brains filled with sludge
[444.40 - 448.24] and pus all going through it and acid
[447.28 - 451.04] going through it
[448.24 - 452.96] we walk around with acid brains because
[451.04 - 456.08] we need to cleanse
[452.96 - 456.88] and that's how it works once your liver
[456.08 - 458.48] gets dirty
[456.88 - 461.60] it starts to get clogged up over the
[458.48 - 464.64] years everything else gets dirty
[461.60 - 467.20] and nasty that's how our bodies work
[464.64 - 470.72] that's how our system works
[467.20 - 470.72] important to know right there
[473.04 - 476.24] so i don't know if you guys were ever
[474.56 - 480.40] told or if you ever heard about
[476.24 - 483.28] it don't cleanse one of the most
[480.40 - 483.84] powerful and cleansing foods bring some
[483.28 - 486.56] of the uh
[483.84 - 490.24] con reading some of the comments to you
[486.56 - 490.24] guys trying to catch them wherever i can
[490.84 - 494.16] um
[492.32 - 496.24] so someone's saying most chemicals
[494.16 - 497.92] cannot pass through the blood-brain
[496.24 - 501.92] barrier
[497.92 - 505.28] uh did you just say blood
[501.92 - 508.72] did you say blood so on tick-tock most
[505.28 - 510.48] chemicals and toxins cannot pass through
[508.72 - 513.20] the blood-brain barrier
[510.48 - 513.92] uh does your does your brain need any
[513.20 - 518.16] blood
[513.92 - 520.24] you guys does your brain get any blood
[518.16 - 522.08] i'm just curious about that just because
[520.24 - 524.80] i'm scratching my head on that one
[522.08 - 525.52] i love when you throw a comment at me
[524.80 - 528.24] that
[525.52 - 529.28] is so ridiculous that it's a head
[528.24 - 534.32] scratcher um
[529.28 - 536.40] okay so if blood gets to your brain
[534.32 - 538.24] in it is going to be to poisons and
[536.40 - 540.40] toxins you know that right
[538.24 - 541.84] on tick tock you know that right i mean
[540.40 - 544.24] you know that
[541.84 - 545.20] your blood is filled with garbage and
[544.24 - 548.24] junk chemical
[545.20 - 551.60] chemical compounds that are synthesized
[548.24 - 552.72] chemicals toxins fragrances junk toxic
[551.60 - 555.52] heavy metals
[552.72 - 556.32] all kinds of exposure fat acids all
[555.52 - 558.00] kinds of things
[556.32 - 560.16] floating around your bloodstream right
[558.00 - 561.36] okay all the pesticides herbicides
[560.16 - 562.48] fungicides floating around your
[561.36 - 565.12] bloodstream right
[562.48 - 566.72] bloodstream did you hear me bloodstream
[565.12 - 569.92] did you know your brain gets
[566.72 - 571.68] blood right
[569.92 - 574.84] so when you try to throw out that whole
[571.68 - 577.92] thing that blood brain barrier thing
[574.84 - 581.04] okay your brain tissue
[577.92 - 582.96] needs blood so you're pretending no
[581.04 - 584.72] blood goes to the brain whatsoever
[582.96 - 586.56] so you're just pretending you're just
[584.72 - 588.40] telling me it's all spinal fluid
[586.56 - 591.52] so not one drop of blood goes through
[588.40 - 593.20] the brain it's just all spinal fluid
[591.52 - 594.96] so that doesn't even make sense
[593.20 - 596.16] basically that's just already naturally
[594.96 - 598.96] debunked
[596.16 - 599.44] your blood is filled with junk your
[598.96 - 603.04] blood
[599.44 - 605.52] goes to the brain that's how it works
[603.04 - 607.12] is there a part of the brain that
[605.52 - 609.44] actually has the spinal fluid
[607.12 - 610.24] aspect of it yeah but what about the
[609.44 - 611.84] rest of it
[610.24 - 615.20] what about the wrestling it's critical
[611.84 - 615.20] this is critical information
[615.60 - 619.76] but you know what though i'm glad you're
[618.16 - 621.68] here on tick tock and i appreciate it
[619.76 - 623.04] because it's those kinds of comments
[621.68 - 624.64] that are important because
[623.04 - 626.80] someone else is going to hear that
[624.64 - 627.44] catherine elizabeth gaspino good to see
[626.80 - 630.56] you
[627.44 - 633.92] um if the liver can't
[630.56 - 636.16] clean up and stop the toxin it's gonna
[633.92 - 639.12] go to the brain
[636.16 - 640.00] and you're gonna get sicker and sicker
[639.12 - 643.52] someday or
[640.00 - 647.60] get sick that's how it works
[643.52 - 650.48] it's important to know so
[647.60 - 651.68] the blood brain barrier you can't
[650.48 - 654.32] pretend
[651.68 - 655.68] the brain doesn't get any any blood
[654.32 - 658.24] whatsoever
[655.68 - 659.60] you can't pretend it gets no blood
[658.24 - 662.80] because it does
[659.60 - 663.44] it does and that blood is dirty going to
[662.80 - 668.56] the brain
[663.44 - 668.56] that's how it works yeah
[670.40 - 673.76] the liver is your filter that's your big
[673.04 - 676.00] filter
[673.76 - 678.56] i'm watching the comments on tick-tock
[676.00 - 678.56] for the moment
[679.60 - 682.72] bro the blood-brain barrier is not your
[681.76 - 685.52] filter
[682.72 - 688.80] so it's not your brain's filter so keep
[685.52 - 691.44] that in mind too
[688.80 - 693.12] catherine says we were told to cleanse
[691.44 - 694.80] but not in the right way okay so let's
[693.12 - 697.84] go into that part
[694.80 - 699.76] catherine really good point okay a lot
[697.84 - 702.24] of people are told to cleanse
[699.76 - 703.20] and it's all the wrong way so keep that
[702.24 - 707.12] in mind
[703.20 - 710.48] friends for instance you can't cleanse
[707.12 - 712.96] if there are any fats in your cleanse
[710.48 - 713.52] if you're downing olive oil in a cleanse
[712.96 - 715.28] because
[713.52 - 716.96] that happens a lot have you guys ever
[715.28 - 718.48] heard that have you ever heard of like
[716.96 - 719.76] cleanses where you're dumping olive oil
[718.48 - 721.28] and straight straight in you
[719.76 - 723.04] just let you know let me know if you
[721.28 - 723.68] drop a comment and let me know about
[723.04 - 726.32] that one
[723.68 - 727.84] if you've seen that before live on

[727.84 - 731.20] live on facebook live on youtube have
[730.80 - 734.08] you
[731.20 - 734.80] heard of olive oil being in a cleanse at
[734.08 - 738.32] all
[734.80 - 741.84] just curious because
[738.32 - 742.40] you can't cleanse anything if there's a
[741.84 - 746.64] fat
[742.40 - 750.56] inside your cleanse okay
[746.64 - 752.08] so keep that in mind that's important
[750.56 - 753.60] once you have fat in your bloodstream
[752.08 - 757.52] your liver can't cleanse
[753.60 - 760.64] it's focused on producing bile
[757.52 - 763.36] that's how it works so you can be
[760.64 - 765.04] you can be somebody that's eating light
[763.36 - 769.12] you're just doing some drinks
[765.04 - 770.32] with with olive oil in there right
[769.12 - 772.48] i'm seeing some of you guys have
[770.32 - 774.56] actually seen that liver flush
[772.48 - 776.16] right crispy apple says liver flush with
[774.56 - 778.32] the olive oil
[776.16 - 780.24] you don't flush the liver when you're
[778.32 - 782.08] doing the olive oil you don't
[780.24 - 784.64] all you're doing is shutting the liver
[782.08 - 786.72] down it can't cleanse when you put
[784.64 - 788.56] when you put the olive oil in there this
[786.72 - 791.28] is really important
[788.56 - 793.60] linea says i have a friend who is
[791.28 - 795.60] drinking olive oil to cleanse
[793.60 - 797.84] but he never got better because you
[795.60 - 801.20] can't cleanse
[797.84 - 805.52] you can't cleanse with
[801.20 - 808.80] olive oil in your cleanse drink
[805.52 - 812.08] it's not possible you
[808.80 - 816.48] have to stop the liver from
[812.08 - 820.72] having to work in order to cleanse
[816.48 - 825.92] your liver needs to take a vacation
[820.72 - 829.28] in order for you to cleanse
[825.92 - 831.52] bottom line that's how it works
[829.28 - 832.96] the minute you dump in the fat and
[831.52 - 834.80] you're dropping in the fat
[832.96 - 836.16] and you're putting in your drink and
[834.80 - 839.28] someone's gave you some
[836.16 - 842.32] brilliant brainiac cleanse idea
[839.28 - 844.00] because of some trendy bs cleanse and
[842.32 - 845.76] you're dropping the olive oil in
[844.00 - 847.68] and that olive oil goes in there the
[845.76 - 850.96] minute it goes in
[847.68 - 852.72] all bets are off game is over
[850.96 - 854.56] there is no cleansing it's not gonna
[852.72 - 856.80] happen it can't happen it never will and
[854.56 - 860.48] it won't
[856.80 - 864.80] okay what degree of cleansing you do
[860.48 - 868.64] depends on how
[864.80 - 872.40] easy you make life for your liver
[868.64 - 876.08] that's what determines a cleanse
[872.40 - 878.40] how easy it is for your liver
[876.08 - 879.36] that's what determines a cleanse right
[878.40 - 881.44] there
[879.36 - 883.44] and the minute there's fat in that
[881.44 - 884.24] cleanse the minute there's olive oil in
[883.44 - 886.80] that cleanse
[884.24 - 888.88] game over there is no cleanse there is
[886.80 - 890.64] no cleanse
[888.88 - 893.36] the minute there's coconut oil in your
[890.64 - 896.48] cleanse game over there is no cleanse
[893.36 - 898.80] game over no one's cleansing that day
[896.48 - 901.20] no one's cleansing that day you got some
[898.80 - 905.36] olive oil no one's cleansing that day
[901.20 - 906.56] the minute avocado is in that cleanse
[905.36 - 909.12] game over
[906.56 - 912.00] game over you're not cleaning nothing up
[909.12 - 913.76] you're not cleaning nothing up
[912.00 - 915.60] you're not elizabeth says i tried
[913.76 - 917.76] coconut oil a few times
[915.60 - 919.68] stopped right away i knew it wasn't
[917.76 - 922.24] right
[919.68 - 924.16] it's hard on the pancreas hard on the
[922.24 - 925.52] pancreas
[924.16 - 927.28] i've known people they've done that
[925.52 - 927.68] coconut oil because they're ready to put
[927.28 - 929.68] you
[927.68 - 931.84] two three tablespoons of coconut oil in
[929.68 - 935.20] your in your smoothie
[931.84 - 938.64] and they get pancreatitis
[935.20 - 940.40] because your pancreas went oh my god
[938.64 - 942.08] your pancreas just went you just tried
[940.40 - 944.16] to kill me
[942.08 - 945.12] yeah it's a healthy fat yeah coconut oil
[944.16 - 948.80] is a healthy fat
[945.12 - 949.68] but still what about fat later in the
[948.80 - 952.88] day
[949.68 - 955.52] does detox stop yes your teeth
[952.88 - 957.76] your detox stops fat later in the day
[955.52 - 961.44] your detox stops but here's the thing
[957.76 - 963.60] that's okay that's okay because if you
[961.44 - 966.40] do the medical medium morning cleanse in

[1113.44 - 1118.08] evidence has an answer for why
[1115.44 - 1121.44] everybody's got chronic illness
[1118.08 - 1123.52] what's scientific evidence right
[1121.44 - 1125.20] is there of why children have eczema

[1127.92 - 1132.64] conditions
[1129.44 - 1135.12] what scientific evidence right
[1132.64 - 1136.80] where science doesn't even know why
[1135.12 - 1139.84] anybody's sick
[1136.80 - 1142.08] where's the scientific evidence there
[1139.84 - 1143.44] besides science says they don't know why
[1142.08 - 1145.60] everybody is sick
[1143.44 - 1147.60] even science and research says they
[1145.60 - 1150.24] don't know what everybody's saying
[1147.60 - 1151.60] okay so you need scientific evidence
[1150.24 - 1153.28] from science
[1151.60 - 1155.04] that doesn't know why anybody's sick
[1153.28 - 1156.24] just think about that just try to wrap
[1155.04 - 1157.84] your head around that for like two
[1156.24 - 1159.28] seconds
[1157.84 - 1160.96] signs of research don't know why
[1159.28 - 1162.72] anybody's sick why you have trigeminal
[1160.96 - 1163.36] neuralgia why you have fibromyalgia
[1162.72 - 1167.20] while you have
[1163.36 - 1167.68] thyroid hypoglycemic hyperglycemic while
[1167.20 - 1169.84] you're
[1167.68 - 1171.68] your thyroiditis hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1169.84 - 1175.12] hypothyroidism graves

[1181.68 - 1186.48] anybody's sick
[1182.88 - 1189.92] but you want scientific evidence
[1186.48 - 1191.28] that's what you want but what you will
[1189.92 - 1193.04] find that science takes
[1191.28 - 1194.88] information from medical medium after
[1193.04 - 1196.16] it's been published so and here's one
[1194.88 - 1197.84] thing for like if you're a
[1196.16 - 1199.76] science-minded person
[1197.84 - 1202.00] science and research has never proved
[1199.76 - 1206.08] medical medium information wrong yet
[1202.00 - 1208.32] it's only proven it right that's a fact
[1206.08 - 1210.08] the info is advanced it's already healed
[1208.32 - 1211.36] millions worldwide from chronic illness
[1210.08 - 1214.48] and i have the street cred
[1211.36 - 1217.92] see what i like is street cred
[1214.48 - 1219.84] scientific data doesn't make me happy
[1217.92 - 1221.44] because i've seen millions of people
[1219.84 - 1222.88] screwed over out there
[1221.44 - 1224.72] losing their lives losing their
[1222.88 - 1226.00] livelihoods losing their careers losing
[1224.72 - 1227.20] their relationships losing their
[1226.00 - 1229.04] husbands and wives
[1227.20 - 1231.52] losing their boyfriends and girlfriends
[1229.04 - 1233.28] losing their fiances
[1231.52 - 1234.80] because of sickness and chronic sickness
[1233.28 - 1235.52] and illness because it's either made
[1234.80 - 1240.40] them
[1235.52 - 1240.40] lose it completely or made them so sick
[1241.52 - 1247.92] lerna says science was not able to help
[1244.96 - 1250.64] me with my bad trigeminal neuralgia mm
[1247.92 - 1251.28] healed me science just drilled my
[1250.64 - 1253.84] healthy
[1251.28 - 1255.04] teeth until i lost several of my
[1253.84 - 1258.16] beautiful teeth so
[1255.04 - 1259.84] on tick-tock did you hear that
[1258.16 - 1262.08] see how important it is to know how
[1259.84 - 1264.24] things work so i get it i know you're
[1262.08 - 1266.08] curious where's your scientific evidence
[1264.24 - 1267.28] about fats
[1266.08 - 1268.64] but you're when you're dealing with
[1267.28 - 1270.48] medical medium information you're
[1268.64 - 1272.16] dealing with medical medium information
[1270.48 - 1273.68] you're dealing with advanced information
[1272.16 - 1276.24] that science takes later
[1273.68 - 1277.92] all the doctors are using now people are
[1276.24 - 1279.36] stealing it left and right in the health
[1277.92 - 1281.04] movement and not citing it back to
[1279.36 - 1284.16] medical medium even though
[1281.04 - 1285.44] factual it's been published first
[1284.16 - 1287.92] so what you're going to find if you're
[1285.44 - 1290.96] new here mm info has never been proven
[1287.92 - 1292.88] wrong and it's never contradicted itself
[1290.96 - 1294.56] fact but when you go listen to your
[1292.88 - 1296.40] doctors on your doctor podcast or
[1294.56 - 1298.72] something
[1296.40 - 1300.48] and they're stealing medical medium
[1298.72 - 1302.40] information
[1300.48 - 1304.00] or they've contradicted themselves a
[1302.40 - 1305.12] million times throughout the last 10
[1304.00 - 1308.40] years of the career
[1305.12 - 1310.64] think about that for a second so let's
[1308.40 - 1313.20] talk about this
[1310.64 - 1315.28] our livers get sluggish and stagnant
[1313.20 - 1316.48] they get overworked they get pathogens
[1315.28 - 1319.36] inside of them
[1316.48 - 1320.88] everybody has bugs inside their liver
[1319.36 - 1323.76] just letting you guys know
[1320.88 - 1324.56] really important everybody has bugs
[1323.76 - 1328.88] inside
[1324.56 - 1332.48] their liver okay it's a buggy world
[1328.88 - 1335.68] we live with bugs austin said
[1332.48 - 1337.20] aw doesn't contradict himself if you
[1335.68 - 1339.52] read the books
[1337.20 - 1341.04] you listen to the podcasts listen to any
[1339.52 - 1342.80] interview i've ever done
[1341.04 - 1344.96] and you can go back to lectures a long
[1342.80 - 1346.72] time even long before
[1344.96 - 1348.48] okay and you'll find there's no
[1346.72 - 1349.68] contradictions i've been saying the same
[1348.48 - 1353.12] thing since i was four
[1349.68 - 1356.08] years old saying the same thing since i
[1353.12 - 1356.08] was four years old
[1356.24 - 1360.00] so let's go into this a little bit on
[1358.48 - 1362.40] the liver side of it very
[1360.00 - 1362.40] important

[1479.92 - 1483.84] you just hit your liver with fats right
[1482.48 - 1487.36] that's how it works
[1483.84 - 1490.72] so you had to roast the chicken at night
[1487.36 - 1493.12] for dinner you had your roasted chicken
[1490.72 - 1495.84] at night for dinner you just slammed
[1493.12 - 1500.32] your liver with fats okay
[1495.84 - 1502.88] but you go to bed and the hours go by
[1500.32 - 1504.40] right say you eat at seven o'clock at
[1502.88 - 1506.56] night
[1504.40 - 1508.88] three hours later it's ten o'clock at
[1506.56 - 1508.88] night
[1510.08 - 1513.12] four hours later it's eleven five hours

[1515.60 - 1520.32] morning you're
[1516.24 - 1522.56] seven hours since eating your fat
[1520.32 - 1523.84] three in the morning i think we're at
[1522.56 - 1524.80] three in the morning two in the morning
[1523.84 - 1528.08] three in the morning
[1524.80 - 1531.68] three in the morning okay
[1528.08 - 1533.60] we're another couple of hours in
[1531.68 - 1535.28] now we're getting to the point where we
[1533.60 - 1539.68] haven't eaten
[1535.28 - 1542.88] in a lot of hours keep that in mind
[1539.68 - 1546.24] you're eight hours into not eating
[1542.88 - 1549.84] eight hours right

[1549.84 - 1554.56] it's clean it's already been working on
[1552.08 - 1557.60] dealing with processing that dinner time
[1554.56 - 1560.72] fat it was processing and working on it
[1557.60 - 1563.60] hours ago eight hours ago
[1560.72 - 1565.28] see guys how it works eight hours ago it
[1563.60 - 1568.80] was already processing
[1565.28 - 1572.08] by three four in the morning now
[1568.80 - 1575.20] we're nine hours into it if
[1572.08 - 1576.64] my math is right right there four four
[1575.20 - 1578.48] four in the morning we're nine hours
[1576.64 - 1580.64] into it
[1578.48 - 1582.88] five in the morning we're 10 hours into
[1580.64 - 1586.40] it your liver hasn't
[1582.88 - 1589.44] had to deal with fat in 10 hours
[1586.40 - 1589.44] six in the morning
[1589.68 - 1597.76] you're 11 hours into it or whatever
[1594.00 - 1599.36] now you're 9 10 11 hours into it
[1597.76 - 1600.72] you wake up at seven in the morning
[1599.36 - 1602.00] let's just may you wake up maybe you
[1600.72 - 1602.88] wake up at six maybe you wake up at
[1602.00 - 1605.92] seven
[1602.88 - 1609.52] your chicken fat
[1605.92 - 1613.20] isn't hurting the liver so much anymore
[1609.52 - 1615.36] it's now it's detoxing it's ready to
[1613.20 - 1616.48] detox it's ready to cleanse it's ready
[1615.36 - 1618.72] to clean
[1616.48 - 1620.72] your liver is ready to clean now you see
[1618.72 - 1624.00] how it works you guys
[1620.72 - 1624.88] you see how it works your liver is ready
[1624.00 - 1629.44] now
[1624.88 - 1629.44] okay the chicken you ate
[1630.24 - 1639.12] the chicken you ate was a long time ago
[1634.72 - 1641.68] right the chicken fat was a long time
[1639.12 - 1644.72] ago you guys
[1641.68 - 1645.04] but here's the deal you don't want to
[1644.72 - 1647.52] put
[1645.04 - 1650.56] fat back in your diet in the morning
[1647.52 - 1650.56] because the minute you do
[1650.64 - 1658.00] you can't cleanse you can't clean
[1654.00 - 1660.88] up it's not going to happen
[1658.00 - 1660.88] i'm letting you know
[1662.48 - 1665.76] the minute you drop in that peanut
[1664.08 - 1666.16] butter on your smoothie the minute you
[1665.76 - 1668.08] put
[1666.16 - 1669.52] that olive oil in your smoothie the
[1668.08 - 1671.12] minute you have your coconut oil minute
[1669.52 - 1675.76] you put olive oil on your bread
[1671.12 - 1678.96] the minute you have avocado
[1675.76 - 1682.24] you're not cleansing anymore done
[1678.96 - 1683.92] it's over and i know that gets people
[1682.24 - 1684.96] upset they're like oh he doesn't like
[1683.92 - 1687.36] avocado
[1684.96 - 1689.20] he must be a real stupid guy in the
[1687.36 - 1691.28] health scene he must be really dumb
[1689.20 - 1693.68] because every single podcast i listen to
[1691.28 - 1696.24] they talk about how healthy avocado is
[1693.68 - 1698.00] everybody's having avocado toast he must
[1696.24 - 1699.60] not know what's going on are you kidding
[1698.00 - 1702.08] me
[1699.60 - 1704.08] i i still don't i still i'm still not
[1702.08 - 1705.84] sure we'd be here in the avocado world
[1704.08 - 1706.32] like we were if it wasn't for 35 years
[1705.84 - 1708.00] of me
[1706.32 - 1709.76] trying to teach people to eat avocado
[1708.00 - 1713.04] because i needed them to eat avocado
[1709.76 - 1715.28] instead of pork because it's a better
[1713.04 - 1718.80] fat it's a healthy fat
[1715.28 - 1721.60] but it doesn't it doesn't change
[1718.80 - 1722.72] the fact that when you have your avocado
[1721.60 - 1726.00] in the morning
[1722.72 - 1728.00] your cleanse just ended
[1726.00 - 1729.04] i try to get people to eat avocado
[1728.00 - 1732.48] instead of actual
[1729.04 - 1735.60] butter 30 years ago 35 years ago so i
[1732.48 - 1737.20] love when someone comes on board
[1735.60 - 1739.36] doesn't even know what's going on and
[1737.20 - 1742.56] says well he's anti-avocado he must not
[1739.36 - 1744.40] be a smart guy because everybody knows
[1742.56 - 1746.80] everyone knows avocado is so good for
[1744.40 - 1746.80] you now
[1748.64 - 1756.40] let's make some lemon water

[1918.72 - 1922.72] right
[1919.20 - 1925.92] get the lime in there you got it
[1922.72 - 1929.36] right already
[1925.92 - 1932.00] you're doing it you just woke up
[1929.36 - 1933.28] you're doing it okay now here's the
[1932.00 - 1934.72] thing just so you know
[1933.28 - 1937.44] i'm gonna give you some very important
[1934.72 - 1937.44] tip right here
[1938.40 - 1941.84] you wake up in the morning
[1942.08 - 1948.48] and you have your coffee and you say
[1945.04 - 1950.40] well i'm not eating anthony
[1948.48 - 1952.16] so i should be cleansing fine i just
[1950.40 - 1956.00] have my coffee
[1952.16 - 1959.28] and i'm drinking my coffee black aw
[1956.00 - 1959.60] so i should be cleansing because there's
[1959.28 - 1964.80] no
[1959.60 - 1964.80] fat in my coffee i'm drinking it black
[1965.04 - 1972.64] wrong wrong here's how it works
[1969.68 - 1974.32] the minute you use the psychoactive drug
[1972.64 - 1976.88] caffeine
[1974.32 - 1979.76] the minute you use that in the morning
[1976.88 - 1979.76] guess what happens
[1981.52 - 1990.32] your adrenaline stops your cleanse
[1986.48 - 1992.64] adrenaline produced by the psychoactive
[1990.32 - 1996.40] drug caffeine in the morning
[1992.64 - 2000.80] stops your cleanse your cleansing
[1996.40 - 2004.16] over done and done
[2000.80 - 2006.48] that's how it works just so you know
[2004.16 - 2009.60] because adrenaline is so highly
[2006.48 - 2011.84] corrosive and toxic
[2009.60 - 2012.72] that the liver has to put up with it
[2011.84 - 2014.48] immediately
[2012.72 - 2016.32] it has to shut down it's cleansing
[2014.48 - 2018.80] immediately your liver is done
[2016.32 - 2021.52] it's done the minute you drink your
[2018.80 - 2023.44] coffee in the morning
[2021.52 - 2025.44] i don't care if you're someone's like i
[2023.44 - 2027.36] don't really eat much in the morning i
[2025.44 - 2028.64] don't need anything i just drink my cup
[2027.36 - 2031.44] of coffee
[2028.64 - 2032.00] so i'm not a big ham and egg person in
[2031.44 - 2035.84] the morning
[2032.00 - 2038.00] so i aw really you know i got it covered
[2035.84 - 2039.68] what happens is the minute you drink
[2038.00 - 2041.12] your coffee you have your psychoactive
[2039.68 - 2044.08] drug in the morning
[2041.12 - 2045.44] your adrenals start to explode release
[2044.08 - 2047.76] all the epinephrine
[2045.44 - 2049.36] and your liver has to suck it up and
[2047.76 - 2050.80] absorb it up and it has to stop
[2049.36 - 2052.64] cleansing immediately and
[2050.80 - 2054.16] decaf still it's the same thing it's
[2052.64 - 2054.80] caffeine green tea is still the same
[2054.16 - 2057.36] thing
[2054.80 - 2060.32] matcha tea is still the same thing just
[2057.36 - 2062.96] letting you know
[2060.32 - 2064.08] so you do your coffee in the morning
[2062.96 - 2067.44] guess what
[2064.08 - 2073.04] you're not cleansing it's over
[2067.44 - 2075.36] no plans happening no cleanse happening
[2073.04 - 2078.16] lerna says coffee is extremely toxic on
[2075.36 - 2079.60] the body it destroys bones and teeth it
[2078.16 - 2081.60] does
[2079.60 - 2083.28] it does now if you're going to keep your
[2081.60 - 2084.64] coffee in i still want you to do your
[2083.28 - 2086.64] celery juice
[2084.64 - 2088.00] they're still going to be helpful
[2086.64 - 2089.76] abilities that everything
[2088.00 - 2091.36] has i still want to do your lemon water
[2089.76 - 2092.88] i'm talking i'm talking about the
[2091.36 - 2093.84] medical medium morning cleanse about
[2092.88 - 2096.88] cleansing
[2093.84 - 2099.12] deep stuff so you cleanse every day
[2096.88 - 2101.76] and you work on healing and the minute
[2099.12 - 2104.80] you bring in that caffeine
[2101.76 - 2107.76] cleanse stops because your adrenaline is
[2104.80 - 2110.80] so toxic your liver has to absorb it
[2107.76 - 2113.12] so cleanse over done
[2110.80 - 2113.12] over
[2114.72 - 2118.48] if you're gonna drink your coffee and i
[2116.48 - 2121.92] can't stop you you drink your coffee
[2118.48 - 2123.92] afternoon you drink it after the medical

[2242.72 - 2245.84] the reason why you're not going to
[2244.08 - 2248.08] cleanse
[2245.84 - 2250.16] is because when you run on adrenaline
[2248.08 - 2251.28] and you have no mineral salts or glucose
[2250.16 - 2254.08] in your bloodstream
[2251.28 - 2254.72] and you run on adrenaline you can't
[2254.08 - 2256.08] cleanse
[2254.72 - 2257.84] so you could be somebody that doesn't
[2256.08 - 2261.36] eat anything till noon

[2268.24 - 2271.52] do a little workout you're not gonna
[2270.48 - 2274.40] cleanse
[2271.52 - 2275.52] you're gonna be on adrenaline so you
[2274.40 - 2277.04] won't be cleansing
[2275.52 - 2279.76] you guys see how it works see how
[2277.04 - 2279.76] important this is
[2280.18 - 2284.72] [Music]
[2281.52 - 2285.04] you can only cleanse in the morning if
[2284.72 - 2287.68] you
[2285.04 - 2288.64] keep the glucose and the mineral salts
[2287.68 - 2290.16] in your diet
[2288.64 - 2291.68] which the medical media morning cleanse
[2290.16 - 2294.88] provides and you
[2291.68 - 2297.94] keep the adrenaline out of your

[2539.12 - 2543.36] glucose helps stop the cravings
[2544.00 - 2550.48] got your got your celery juice
[2547.36 - 2551.12] lemon water 16 to 32 ounces in the
[2550.48 - 2552.72] morning
[2551.12 - 2554.24] upon waking or you could wait a little
[2552.72 - 2558.08] bit longer like
[2554.24 - 2559.20] let's see was asking celery juice 16 to
[2558.08 - 2560.56] 32 ounces
[2559.20 - 2562.32] a little bit later now listen if you
[2560.56 - 2564.80] don't have
[2562.32 - 2566.64] frugal frugivore bear good to see you i
[2564.80 - 2571.04] just saw your handle come up
[2566.64 - 2573.68] um if you don't if you don't have celery
[2571.04 - 2575.84] do the lemon water we can get by we can
[2573.68 - 2577.52] do a fruit bowl we can do something
[2575.84 - 2580.00] that doesn't have fat in it but has
[2577.52 - 2582.56] mineral salts and glucose
[2580.00 - 2584.16] your lemon still has in your lime water
[2582.56 - 2586.32] still has mineral salts and glucose you
[2584.16 - 2588.64] see how it works you guys
[2586.32 - 2592.96] important to know see so i'm going to
[2588.64 - 2594.32] move the juicer out of the way right now
[2592.96 - 2596.08] we're gonna make some oatmeal in a
[2594.32 - 2597.12] little while but we're gonna do some
[2596.08 - 2601.92] fruit first
[2597.12 - 2604.24] okay so that's an option right there
[2601.92 - 2606.08] that's got a nice mango right there so
[2604.24 - 2608.32] you guys got a mango in my hand
[2606.08 - 2609.92] just so you know that's an option right
[2608.32 - 2611.44] there you could do oranges
[2609.92 - 2613.92] you can do some mangoes you can do
[2611.44 - 2615.44] papayas that can be something you can do
[2613.92 - 2616.72] too we're gonna do the liver rescue
[2615.44 - 2621.28] smoothie
[2616.72 - 2622.56] but got papaya in my hand right here
[2621.28 - 2624.80] look at this
[2622.56 - 2626.40] so i'm just gonna cut a couple of these
[2624.80 - 2628.16] open real quick you guys just so you
[2626.40 - 2632.00] know that these are real
[2628.16 - 2634.00] papayas real mangoes
[2632.00 - 2635.92] just guys so you guys can see this see
[2634.00 - 2638.64] the inside here
[2635.92 - 2638.64] let's do that
[2641.52 - 2644.96] that's the papaya we have right now
[2643.28 - 2647.28] right
[2644.96 - 2649.12] it's a beautiful papaya don't be afraid
[2647.28 - 2650.16] of fruit it's one of the obstacles that
[2649.12 - 2652.80] happens
[2650.16 - 2654.64] one of the obstacles which is really
[2652.80 - 2658.80] messed up out there
[2654.64 - 2658.80] one of the obstacles is that
[2659.44 - 2664.08] is that we're afraid of fruit we got the
[2661.20 - 2666.64] fruit fear right
[2664.08 - 2668.08] that will get in your way of healing
[2666.64 - 2670.88] because guess what
[2668.08 - 2672.80] if fruit is not in your diet you're
[2670.88 - 2675.20] going to rely more on what
[2672.80 - 2675.92] what are you guys going to rely more on
[2675.20 - 2679.20] you're going to rely
[2675.92 - 2681.84] more on fatty fruits
[2679.20 - 2683.84] it's a fruit but fatty fruits they're
[2681.84 - 2686.16] going to rely on more on nuts and nut
[2683.84 - 2688.80] butters and
[2686.16 - 2690.00] almonds right peanut butter you're going
[2688.80 - 2693.20] to rely more on these
[2690.00 - 2694.96] things is what you're going to do
[2693.20 - 2697.28] you know and that's what's going to
[2694.96 - 2697.28] happen
[2697.84 - 2701.60] you're going to rely more on those
[2699.28 - 2701.60] things
[2702.84 - 2705.84] so
[2707.28 - 2710.96] a lot of times when we rely
[2712.08 - 2715.92] we rely more on those things we get in
[2714.16 - 2716.64] trouble because now we're relying on the
[2715.92 - 2720.40] fat
[2716.64 - 2722.32] is what we're relying on and
[2720.40 - 2723.92] there's really no way out with that one
[2722.32 - 2725.28] you're going to think well no i rely on
[2723.92 - 2726.16] protein that's what you're going to
[2725.28 - 2728.40] you're going to think you're going to be
[2726.16 - 2730.80] like no i rely on protein
[2728.40 - 2732.64] i'm not relying on fat and that's where
[2730.80 - 2734.32] we get in trouble right there because we
[2732.64 - 2737.92] don't realize that
[2734.32 - 2740.16] our protein is filled with fat
[2737.92 - 2747.84] and that's something we don't realize is
[2740.16 - 2747.84] that our protein is filled with fat
[2749.84 - 2753.68] you know what's fun about doing these
[2751.52 - 2756.72] live
[2753.68 - 2761.84] that when you mess up
[2756.72 - 2761.84] everybody knows it
[2762.64 - 2769.68] so so when something's going on and
[2766.32 - 2769.68] you're doing damage control
[2770.72 - 2775.36] everybody can figure it out all right
[2773.04 - 2778.64] i'm back i'm back
[2775.36 - 2779.76] where did i go green blue i forgot to
[2778.64 - 2783.20] defrost the
[2779.76 - 2785.36] pitaya so

[2785.36 - 2788.72] dragon fruit right there

[2791.52 - 2796.96] and it was all stuck together and i was
[2793.68 - 2801.76] trying to chip away at it like this
[2796.96 - 2803.28] chipping away with a spoon to get it out
[2801.76 - 2804.24] guys we're live on clubhouse live on

[2821.76 - 2829.04] so many people swear by it
[2825.04 - 2830.96] but science didn't didn't say so
[2829.04 - 2832.96] it doesn't matter what people say
[2830.96 - 2834.40] doesn't matter about people healing
[2832.96 - 2837.12] doesn't matter about people getting
[2834.40 - 2840.48] their lives back doesn't matter
[2837.12 - 2841.20] right because science science didn't
[2840.48 - 2842.96] okay it

[2880.48 - 2887.92] you know what that is
[2886.08 - 2890.48] i work with them on that juice by the
[2887.92 - 2892.96] way i work with them
[2890.48 - 2895.28] this is for the record that's the
[2892.96 - 2897.92] wyman's wild blueberry juice you guys
[2895.28 - 2899.36] i'm i'm obsessed with it obsessed with
[2897.92 - 2902.24] it
[2899.36 - 2903.60] so i just popped in some frozen wild
[2902.24 - 2904.96] blueberries
[2903.60 - 2906.72] right that's two cups of frozen wild
[2904.96 - 2909.36] blueberries i'm making the
[2906.72 - 2912.84] medical medium liver rescue smoothie
[2909.36 - 2914.00] let's get the bananas next where are the
[2912.84 - 2916.96] bananas
[2914.00 - 2916.96] some bananas going
[2917.52 - 2925.84] so science research
[2922.56 - 2930.16] doesn't if they don't okay you healing
[2925.84 - 2932.64] you didn't heal if your eczema went away
[2930.16 - 2935.20] it's not real science research didn't
[2932.64 - 2935.20] okay it
[2935.68 - 2939.92] you're not allowed to heal on your own
[2940.32 - 2946.56] science and research won't validate it
[2943.44 - 2946.56] putting two bananas in here
[2948.40 - 2952.80] so whenever you hear anybody come out
[2950.72 - 2954.56] and throw signs of research crap
[2952.80 - 2957.84] like where's your science about that or
[2954.56 - 2957.84] where's your research about that
[2957.92 - 2961.52] you've got to realize where they're
[2959.92 - 2962.72] coming from they're coming from a real
[2961.52 - 2964.16] ignorant place
[2962.72 - 2965.44] the person who's saying where's your
[2964.16 - 2967.44] science where's your research is
[2965.44 - 2969.04] completely ignorant to one fact
[2967.44 - 2970.80] science research doesn't want you to
[2969.04 - 2972.40] heal they won't even validate if someone
[2970.80 - 2973.44] actually healed on any level even if
[2972.40 - 2975.84] they got partially better
[2973.44 - 2977.36] science research won't validate it think
[2975.84 - 2979.12] about that
[2977.36 - 2982.48] how psycho is that that's actually
[2979.12 - 2984.24] psycho it's evil really
[2982.48 - 2986.56] it kind of goes beyond it's actually
[2984.24 - 2986.56] evil
[2987.20 - 2992.08] you didn't heal you didn't get better
[2989.36 - 2995.44] your 50 symptoms didn't go away
[2992.08 - 2998.64] besides the research didn't okay
[2995.44 - 2999.76] it just they didn't go away so let's go
[2998.64 - 3001.04] into this a little bit
[2999.76 - 3002.48] a lot of people are hung up on the
[3001.04 - 3003.84] protein factor and i think this is
[3002.48 - 3005.44] important i'm making a liver rescue
[3003.84 - 3007.52] smoothie but i want to just drop this on
[3005.44 - 3009.28] your critical piece of information
[3007.52 - 3012.08] you might be thinking i'm not doing fat
[3009.28 - 3013.04] i'm doing protein in the morning so
[3012.08 - 3015.68] you're thinking your
[3013.04 - 3016.80] your salmon in the morning is protein
[3015.68 - 3018.00] you're thinking you're tuning in the
[3016.80 - 3019.28] morning's protein you're thinking your
[3018.00 - 3020.40] chicken in the mornings protein you're
[3019.28 - 3021.20] thinking your protein powders are
[3020.40 - 3024.72] protein you're thinking
[3021.20 - 3026.24] there's fat and all that you're thinking
[3024.72 - 3027.68] that your nut butters in the morning are
[3026.24 - 3029.20] protein you're thinking your nuts and
[3027.68 - 3030.80] seeds are protein you see how it works
[3029.20 - 3031.60] you're thinking your protein bar is
[3030.80 - 3033.84] protein
[3031.60 - 3035.36] but it's all fat your protein bars fat
[3033.84 - 3036.64] so you're having fat in the morning
[3035.36 - 3038.08] thinking you're doing protein in the
[3036.64 - 3039.76] morning and then you stop your liver
[3038.08 - 3040.24] from cleansing so just keep that in mind
[3039.76 - 3043.44] that's
[3040.24 - 3044.80] really important right there and here's
[3043.44 - 3047.12] another thing too
[3044.80 - 3048.96] don't get obsessed about protein
[3047.12 - 3051.52] proteins in every single
[3048.96 - 3052.64] food protein isn't what keeps your
[3051.52 - 3054.40] muscles growing
[3052.64 - 3056.00] proteins not what makes your muscles
[3054.40 - 3058.32] grow proteins
[3056.00 - 3060.64] not what what not it's not what keeps
[3058.32 - 3064.00] your muscles strong
[3060.64 - 3066.56] okay so it's glucose
[3064.00 - 3067.36] that keeps your muscles strong okay it's
[3066.56 - 3069.20] sugar
[3067.36 - 3070.80] sugar has to enter every cell in the
[3069.20 - 3072.88] body sugar has to enter
[3070.80 - 3074.16] your muscles in order for your muscles
[3072.88 - 3076.08] to work
[3074.16 - 3077.76] sugar plus mineral salts keep that in
[3076.08 - 3079.20] mind if you're a bodybuilder you're
[3077.76 - 3082.48] saying why isn't aw
[3079.20 - 3084.72] like built like a tank that's because i
[3082.48 - 3086.80] don't have the time and energy
[3084.72 - 3088.96] because my time and energy goes into
[3086.80 - 3090.80] working 20-hour days
[3088.96 - 3092.48] and if i sit there and i do a two-hour
[3090.80 - 3093.84] workout every day
[3092.48 - 3097.12] basically what's gonna happen i just
[3093.84 - 3098.80] lost two critical three critical hours
[3097.12 - 3100.56] and so i can't do that right now i have
[3098.80 - 3102.96] a book deadline coming up i have a book
[3100.56 - 3105.92] deadline for the next so many years
[3102.96 - 3107.20] so what i do is i'll go out for a quick
[3105.92 - 3110.00] run or something
[3107.20 - 3111.44] or i'll go out for a quick bike ride but
[3110.00 - 3113.68] i can't go into the gym
[3111.44 - 3115.28] and i can't and i can't go in there for
[3113.68 - 3118.56] two three hours a day
[3115.28 - 3120.32] start dedicating my life to bulking up
[3118.56 - 3122.56] it's just not it's just it's not
[3120.32 - 3124.64] something it takes an actual commitment
[3122.56 - 3126.32] of time
[3124.64 - 3129.04] doesn't you know i can't i go out and i
[3126.32 - 3132.48] try to do a half an hour where i can
[3129.04 - 3134.00] so keep that in mind if you're
[3132.48 - 3135.52] somebody's a bodybuilder what i do is i
[3134.00 - 3137.20] help bodybuilders i help you pro
[3135.52 - 3138.00] bodybuilders out there get their you
[3137.20 - 3140.00] know get their muscles
[3138.00 - 3141.92] to wherever they need to get it and i
[3140.00 - 3144.00] notice that when when a body builder
[3141.92 - 3146.08] gets older they lose their muscle
[3144.00 - 3148.24] unless they get enough carbohydrate you
[3146.08 - 3151.44] guys hear that you hear that
[3148.24 - 3153.36] when uh when when when athletes and
[3151.44 - 3156.72] bodybuilders get older
[3153.36 - 3159.20] and now they're in their 40s they start
[3156.72 - 3161.12] losing all their muscle
[3159.20 - 3162.40] because they're they're getting maxed
[3161.12 - 3164.00] out with fat
[3162.40 - 3165.44] they're just their fats are stuck all
[3164.00 - 3167.12] the fat
[3165.44 - 3168.72] in their protein they're eating is
[3167.12 - 3170.08] stopping their muscles from being able
[3168.72 - 3172.24] to stay strong
[3170.08 - 3173.76] so they start to decline so then you've
[3172.24 - 3174.32] got to switch it out you've got to take
[3173.76 - 3176.16] the fat
[3174.32 - 3177.92] out of their diet and bring in more
[3176.16 - 3179.52] carbohydrate and then when they're 40
[3177.92 - 3180.96] years old you could get them built back
[3179.52 - 3184.72] up again
[3180.96 - 3185.52] that's how it's done medical medium
[3184.72 - 3186.88] style
[3185.52 - 3188.00] so we're doing a liver rescue smoothie
[3186.88 - 3189.52] we've got bananas in there while
[3188.00 - 3191.44] blueberries i put some wine and wild
[3189.52 - 3193.80] blueberry juice
[3191.44 - 3196.00] um that's at shop lyman's
[3193.80 - 3199.44] lymanshot.weimans.com
[3196.00 - 3202.16] and keep the protein powders out
[3199.44 - 3202.96] keep the protein powders out okay very
[3202.16 - 3207.12] important to know
[3202.96 - 3210.08] keep the protein powders out um
[3207.12 - 3211.04] i'll put the vimergy wild blueberry
[3210.08 - 3214.80] powder in there too
[3211.04 - 3219.12] thing is with antioxidants is i love
[3214.80 - 3221.36] antioxidants right like i always have
[3219.12 - 3222.32] going all the way back so i try to get
[3221.36 - 3225.44] them where i can
[3222.32 - 3227.68] so i'll put the vimorjiwab blueberry
[3225.44 - 3231.84] powder in here
[3227.68 - 3236.64] with the frozen wild blueberries with
[3231.84 - 3238.96] the wyman blueberry juice right
[3236.64 - 3242.00] keep protein powders out they got hidden
[3238.96 - 3243.76] sugars they got hidden msg
[3242.00 - 3246.00] so that's another thing to keep in mind
[3243.76 - 3248.80] another important piece of information
[3246.00 - 3250.64] boom keep protein powders out you want
[3248.80 - 3251.20] to get healthier keep protein powders
[3250.64 - 3253.12] out
[3251.20 - 3254.64] protein powders don't make you healthier
[3253.12 - 3256.40] they got natural flavorings
[3254.64 - 3257.84] in most of them most of the protein
[3256.40 - 3261.04] powders have natural
[3257.84 - 3265.04] flavor in them
[3261.04 - 3266.96] and those natural flavorings is msg
[3265.04 - 3269.12] so in some protein powders they got
[3266.96 - 3272.56] added fat in them
[3269.12 - 3274.64] they got added msg in them okay
[3272.56 - 3276.88] and too much protein by the way kills
[3274.64 - 3279.28] your kidneys it kills your liver so
[3276.88 - 3280.72] there you go you don't want to be doing
[3279.28 - 3283.04] that
[3280.72 - 3283.76] lissy cone says and p protein is harsh
[3283.04 - 3286.16] on the stomach
[3283.76 - 3286.96] right question mark totally right let's
[3286.16 - 3290.96] see totally
[3286.96 - 3293.36] harsh on the stomach totally

[3328.16 - 3335.36] liver rescue smoothie
[3330.08 - 3338.56] is what i do believe put this over here

[3343.20 - 3349.84] got it blending up right now you guys
[3354.32 - 3358.24] envy doom says aw can you use prickly
[3357.04 - 3361.60] pear instead of
[3358.24 - 3363.84] pattaya uh
[3361.60 - 3363.84] no
[3364.96 - 3369.04] don't use prickly pear instead of
[3366.32 - 3370.00] pattaya and be mindful about prickly
[3369.04 - 3372.40] pear
[3370.00 - 3374.24] self-limiting extremely self-limiting
[3372.40 - 3377.84] keep be mindful on that one
[3374.24 - 3380.96] okay i like prickly pear i do
[3377.84 - 3382.08] right but it's self-limiting it's
[3380.96 - 3384.08] dehydrating
[3382.08 - 3386.16] just letting you know very dehydrating
[3384.08 - 3388.16] so when you have prickly pear
[3386.16 - 3389.44] like it's never been a no-no i've never
[3388.16 - 3392.16] said a no on it
[3389.44 - 3392.72] right you've never heard me say no on it
[3392.16 - 3394.48] but
[3392.72 - 3396.56] it's just a little reminder try not to
[3394.48 - 3397.12] tank it try not to tank that prickly
[3396.56 - 3400.16] pear
[3397.12 - 3402.16] take that prickly pear you're it you'll
[3400.16 - 3404.56] get some dehydration going on
[3402.16 - 3405.36] you might even get the runs but it's
[3404.56 - 3408.24] runs
[3405.36 - 3409.20] on the opposite end of the scale which
[3408.24 - 3411.84] is runs
[3409.20 - 3414.16] not from detox from the prickly pear but
[3411.84 - 3415.20] runs from the hydration from prickly
[3414.16 - 3418.56] pear
[3415.20 - 3423.28] but yeah i still like
[3418.56 - 3426.16] the rescue smoothie done done

[3476.32 - 3480.56] we got some more to do let's turn on the
[3478.48 - 3483.60] griddle
[3480.56 - 3486.48] let's get the griddle on
[3483.60 - 3488.96] griddle's on let's go more to talk about
[3486.48 - 3492.40] okay i'm just focused on
[3488.96 - 3493.68] not knocking crap over and breaking
[3492.40 - 3496.00] stuff right now
[3493.68 - 3497.92] so i'm just focused on making sure i'm
[3496.00 - 3499.84] not
[3497.92 - 3501.28] dropping a whole bottle of juice or
[3499.84 - 3503.60] something down
[3501.28 - 3505.36] if you need a heavy heavier meal you
[3503.60 - 3508.88] could do steamed potatoes winter squash
[3505.36 - 3511.92] sweet potatoes millet oatmeal
[3508.88 - 3514.96] you can do oatmeal now oatmeal is high
[3511.92 - 3516.96] it's higher in fat okay
[3514.96 - 3519.20] that's oatmeal right here right it is
[3516.96 - 3520.64] higher in fat but you're not adding fat
[3519.20 - 3522.56] to it
[3520.64 - 3524.16] it's higher in fat but you're not adding
[3522.56 - 3526.64] fat to it
[3524.16 - 3528.08] so you can still do some cleansing with
[3526.64 - 3529.44] a medical medium morning cleanse if

[3719.52 - 3725.04] we're live on tik-tok facebook youtube
[3721.28 - 3728.08] and clubhouse just for a 4-1-1
[3725.04 - 3730.16] if things seem confusing
[3728.08 - 3731.12] so i got some oatmeal cooking right now
[3730.16 - 3732.56] it's really easy
[3731.12 - 3734.80] it's really easy take a second then i
[3732.56 - 3741.60] realized
[3734.80 - 3744.00] yeah gluten-free oats
[3741.60 - 3745.92] oatmeal is an option if you're somebody
[3744.00 - 3748.16] that can handle grains
[3745.92 - 3749.92] keep that in mind you're somebody that's
[3748.16 - 3750.80] that's okay with grains they can handle
[3749.92 - 3754.88] grains
[3750.80 - 3756.32] oatmeal is an option gluten grains
[3754.88 - 3759.44] are what you want to use it's
[3756.32 - 3762.64] gluten-free grains
[3759.44 - 3762.64] that's what you want to use
[3767.20 - 3770.80] okay if you're somebody that's not
[3769.68 - 3772.72] trying to
[3770.80 - 3774.16] if you're somebody that's not trying to
[3772.72 - 3775.84] heal at all
[3774.16 - 3778.00] it's still the best grains to use it's
[3775.84 - 3780.48] millet that's your number one best grain
[3778.00 - 3782.24] oatmeal is your second best grain if
[3780.48 - 3784.40] you're somebody not trying to heal
[3782.24 - 3785.44] and then you can put your nut milks on
[3784.40 - 3786.88] there if you're somebody that's not
[3785.44 - 3788.32] trying to heal or cleanse you put nut
[3786.88 - 3789.20] milk you put nut butters if that's what
[3788.32 - 3791.84] you want to do
[3789.20 - 3796.24] but i recommend not doing it i recommend
[3791.84 - 3797.92] there's plenty of fat in oatmeal
[3796.24 - 3800.56] if you're somebody that wants to heal
[3797.92 - 3804.32] you can still cleanse
[3800.56 - 3807.12] and do oatmeal and millet
[3804.32 - 3808.84] just keep the fats out keep the fats out
[3807.12 - 3813.44] so you can still cleanse
[3808.84 - 3815.44] okay so this is almost cooked
[3813.44 - 3816.48] so some people like their oatmeal really
[3815.44 - 3818.16] really creamy
[3816.48 - 3820.48] they dump all this nut milk in there
[3818.16 - 3823.44] they make it basically like an oatmeal
[3820.48 - 3826.08] soup i don't like it that way personally
[3823.44 - 3828.08] that's not my style
[3826.08 - 3829.36] i like it really thick that's just the
[3828.08 - 3830.64] way i like to do it
[3829.36 - 3832.64] so i'm going to add some blueberries in
[3830.64 - 3834.56] the oatmeal it's cooking right
[3832.64 - 3838.16] right up right now i'm going to add some
[3834.56 - 3842.56] wild blueberries
[3838.16 - 3842.56] you can cleanse and still have this
[3842.88 - 3847.52] in the morning isn't it interesting
[3848.16 - 3852.56] putting a few more in here there you go
[3850.88 - 3853.28] you can cleanse and still have this in
[3852.56 - 3856.40] the morning
[3853.28 - 3858.80] the reason why you'll cleanse
[3856.40 - 3859.44] is because you don't have the almonds in
[3858.80 - 3861.20] there
[3859.44 - 3863.04] you don't have the peanut butter in
[3861.20 - 3864.48] there you don't have that in there you
[3863.04 - 3867.04] don't have the nut milks in there
[3864.48 - 3870.00] now you can cleanse so you can have the
[3867.04 - 3871.44] oatmeal if that's what you want
[3870.00 - 3873.12] you want to get the best out of a
[3871.44 - 3873.68] cleanse in the morning you do the lemon
[3873.12 - 3876.00] water
[3873.68 - 3877.52] or lime water you do the celery juice
[3876.00 - 3879.60] you do the liver rescue smoothie or the
[3877.52 - 3883.28] heavy metal detox smoothie or both
[3879.60 - 3884.64] both you do your you add additional 16
[3883.28 - 3887.20] ounces of water or
[3884.64 - 3889.52] coconut water right you do it all before
[3887.20 - 3889.52] noon
[3891.60 - 3898.80] that's your best option right there
[3895.36 - 3900.32] that's your best option for cleansing
[3898.80 - 3903.12] but you but if you're somebody that
[3900.32 - 3904.80] needs something like a steamed potato
[3903.12 - 3906.48] don't put the fats on and you'll still
[3904.80 - 3908.56] cleanse if you're somebody that's
[3906.48 - 3909.76] needing some oatmeal or some millet i'm
[3908.56 - 3911.44] cooking oatmeal right now if you guys

[4326.00 - 4329.36] their avocado toast and everything else
[4327.68 - 4331.12] and their kombucha tea
[4329.36 - 4332.56] right meanwhile they're burning yep
[4331.12 - 4334.80] they're adding to chemical warfare
[4332.56 - 4336.88] they're burning all those fragrances
[4334.80 - 4338.72] they're doing all that stuff and they're
[4336.88 - 4341.20] just polluting the planet with it
[4338.72 - 4342.48] they're they're feeding the chemical
[4341.20 - 4345.28] companies
[4342.48 - 4346.80] i can't tell you how many influencers
[4345.28 - 4349.60] use scented candles
[4346.80 - 4350.16] who are into all natural all health
[4349.60 - 4352.72] being
[4350.16 - 4353.36] being awake being woke and everything
[4352.72 - 4355.68] and they're just
[4353.36 - 4357.76] literally giving money to the chemical
[4355.68 - 4359.84] companies
[4357.76 - 4360.96] okay and they're poisoning themselves
[4359.84 - 4362.80] they're poisoning their friends
[4360.96 - 4365.84] poisoning their kids poisoning their
[4362.80 - 4366.80] pets poisoning family members and that's
[4365.84 - 4369.12] what they're doing
[4366.80 - 4370.00] that's just a prime example right there
[4369.12 - 4371.44] anyway some of the
[4370.00 - 4372.48] some of the foods the troublemaker foods
[4371.44 - 4374.32] you don't want to bring in in the
[4372.48 - 4376.32] morning you don't want to do eggs
[4374.32 - 4380.32] you don't want to do that keep the eggs
[4376.32 - 4380.32] out that's important right there
[4383.12 - 4386.88] don't have the eggs in the morning don't
[4385.28 - 4389.28] have the bacon in the morning
[4386.88 - 4391.52] don't have the oiled hash browns in the
[4389.28 - 4392.48] morning don't have the buttered toast in
[4391.52 - 4394.40] the morning
[4392.48 - 4395.76] keep that out that's critical if you
[4394.40 - 4397.44] want a cleanse
[4395.76 - 4398.80] keep the eggs out if you guys wanna
[4397.44 - 4400.48] cleanse you know
[4398.80 - 4402.16] if you wanna cleanse keep the eggs out
[4400.48 - 4405.44] really important
[4402.16 - 4405.44] you want the eggs out
[4406.24 - 4413.04] if you wanna cleanse keep those babies
[4410.16 - 4415.68] out right there
[4413.04 - 4415.68] keep them out
[4420.08 - 4427.84] if you want to cleanse
[4429.04 - 4432.88] i just put some millet in here so i got
[4438.84 - 4444.16] millet
[4440.16 - 4448.08] now might run this right into ig
[4444.16 - 4450.16] you want to keep these eggs out
[4448.08 - 4452.56] of the diet completely if you want to
[4450.16 - 4454.72] heal a condition or disease
[4452.56 - 4456.32] or a symptom but you certainly want to
[4454.72 - 4458.32] keep eggs out in the morning
[4456.32 - 4460.56] don't have them in the morning whatever
[4458.32 - 4461.84] you do
[4460.56 - 4463.20] because you're not going to cleanse if
[4461.84 - 4464.72] you have those in the morning it's not
[4463.20 - 4469.84] going to happen
[4464.72 - 4469.84] this is just the way it works
[4470.56 - 4473.84] if you have a bagel and cream cheese or
[4472.72 - 4475.20] a bagel
[4473.84 - 4477.20] in butter in the morning you're not
[4475.20 - 4478.72] going to cleanse
[4477.20 - 4480.64] instead you're just going to get insulin
[4478.72 - 4482.00] resistance it's another thing that
[4480.64 - 4483.44] happens when everybody puts fat
[4482.00 - 4485.36] in their diet in the morning they just
[4483.44 - 4487.20] continue with their insulin resistance
[4485.36 - 4490.32] worsen it and worsen and worsen over
[4487.20 - 4493.52] time that's what they do
[4490.32 - 4493.52] all these things are important
[4494.56 - 4499.68] one of the reasons why the medical
[4496.00 - 4499.68] meeting morning cleanse has to be done
[4501.52 - 4505.44] is you'll save your bones you'll save
[4503.92 - 4508.32] your teeth
[4505.44 - 4510.24] because you'll cleanse acids out of your
[4508.32 - 4512.72] bloodstream every single morning
[4510.24 - 4514.80] as the night goes on your bloodstream is
[4512.72 - 4517.52] filled with acid
[4514.80 - 4519.28] it's filled with all kinds of acid it's
[4517.52 - 4522.00] filled with
[4519.28 - 4522.88] all kinds of toxins and poisons but real
[4522.00 - 4526.00] acidy
[4522.88 - 4527.76] toxins and poisons okay dr faun md good
[4526.00 - 4530.80] to see you
[4527.76 - 4532.72] so what happens is is that when you do
[4530.80 - 4534.24] your when you wake up in the morning and
[4532.72 - 4536.32] you don't cleanse
[4534.24 - 4538.48] or give your body a chance to clean out
[4536.32 - 4541.12] and cleanse
[4538.48 - 4541.84] you end up losing a little bit of a part
[4541.12 - 4545.20] of yourself
[4541.84 - 4547.20] every day you lose your own bones they
[4545.20 - 4549.12] all slowly dissolve
[4547.20 - 4551.52] that's why when we get older we get the
[4549.12 - 4553.36] osteopenia osteoporosis we lose our
[4551.52 - 4555.60] teeth our skull fracture is easy our
[4553.36 - 4557.28] hips break and fracture easy
[4555.60 - 4558.88] when you get older everything just
[4557.28 - 4561.20] starts breaking because
[4558.88 - 4562.80] we had years of never cleansing no one
[4561.20 - 4566.08] ever cleanses
[4562.80 - 4568.08] so acids cause calcium to leach
[4566.08 - 4569.60] if you don't cleanse the acid out every
[4568.08 - 4572.16] single morning
[4569.60 - 4573.68] the calcium will leech out of your bones
[4572.16 - 4576.64] you see how it works you guys
[4573.68 - 4576.64] see how critical this is
[4578.56 - 4586.64] very important to know how it works okay
[4582.08 - 4589.60] so every single day all night long
[4586.64 - 4589.60] your skeleton
[4590.32 - 4595.04] your skeletal system is begging to get
[4593.28 - 4597.44] rid of those acids
[4595.04 - 4599.84] every single day begging to get rid of
[4597.44 - 4603.04] those acids
[4599.84 - 4606.88] and so cleansing in the morning
[4603.04 - 4608.32] doing your lemon water your celery juice
[4606.88 - 4610.24] making sure there's no fats in your
[4608.32 - 4613.36] oatmeal i'm making um
[4610.24 - 4615.92] millet porridge right now
[4613.36 - 4617.12] sun moon love that's me right now no
[4615.92 - 4619.20] teeth and bones
[4617.12 - 4620.48] are brittle hips and lower back
[4619.20 - 4623.28] osteoporosis
[4620.48 - 4625.44] osteopenia and osteoporosis sure wish i
[4623.28 - 4628.48] would have known about mmm years ago
[4625.44 - 4630.80] you know what i heard going back all the
[4628.48 - 4633.36] way 30 plus years
[4630.80 - 4633.84] opened up an office people coming to me
[4633.36 - 4635.68] every day
[4633.84 - 4637.12] traveling around the world people that
[4635.68 - 4638.00] were sick for 20 years you know what
[4637.12 - 4639.44] they all say
[4638.00 - 4641.28] they would say i wish i knew about you
[4639.44 - 4642.16] 20 years ago well i'd be like well i was
[4641.28 - 4645.20] only just
[4642.16 - 4648.08] i was i was really little then i was a
[4645.20 - 4648.08] real little guy
[4648.84 - 4654.72] so and and but anyway
[4652.24 - 4657.12] but that's what i heard every single day
[4654.72 - 4660.56] people filing into the office
[4657.12 - 4660.88] wish i knew about you wish i knew about
[4660.56 - 4663.60] you
[4660.88 - 4665.52] wish i knew about you yeah people that
[4663.60 - 4667.84] get the books now wish i knew about him
[4665.52 - 4671.52] 10 years ago 20 years ago
[4667.84 - 4673.20] okay and i believe in meditation
[4671.52 - 4675.28] meditation is powerful there's medical
[4673.20 - 4677.44] media meditations all in the books
[4675.28 - 4678.72] but meditation and deep breathing
[4677.44 - 4681.92] doesn't
[4678.72 - 4684.40] fix chronic illness it doesn't
[4681.92 - 4686.72] i wish it did but it doesn't fix chronic
[4684.40 - 4689.20] illness because it won't get the poisons
[4686.72 - 4690.16] out of your liver it won't get the
[4689.20 - 4691.60] viruses out
[4690.16 - 4693.76] it won't get the epstein bar out of your
[4691.60 - 4695.12] system you can deep breathe all you want
[4693.76 - 4696.08] you can deep breathe all you want and i
[4695.12 - 4697.76] love deep breath
[4696.08 - 4700.16] deep breathing you can deep breathe all
[4697.76 - 4703.92] you want you can meditate all you want
[4700.16 - 4703.92] that's that heals your soul
[4704.48 - 4708.32] so what i love about meditation is you
[4706.72 - 4709.52] heal your soul you heal your
[4708.32 - 4713.20] metaphysical you
[4709.52 - 4715.60] heal your subconsciousness you repair
[4713.20 - 4717.12] you repair the emotional center of your
[4715.60 - 4721.84] brain
[4717.12 - 4724.00] that's why meditation is so critical
[4721.84 - 4726.00] but if you got like multiple sclerosis
[4724.00 - 4727.68] and you got trigeminal neuralgia and you
[4726.00 - 4729.36] got chronic fibromyalgia and you got
[4727.68 - 4731.20] severe neurological fatigue and you got
[4729.36 - 4733.04] lupus and you got neurological lyme
[4731.20 - 4736.40] and you got hashimoto's thyronitis you
[4733.04 - 4736.40] can deep breath all you want
[4738.16 - 4742.72] it's different i get it some people be
[4741.04 - 4744.16] like oh i healed from all that deep
[4742.72 - 4746.24] breathing and all that meditation and
[4744.16 - 4748.00] all that rewiring i healed from it
[4746.24 - 4750.24] you know from my so i'm going to teach
[4748.00 - 4753.60] out there because i healed from it
[4750.24 - 4755.52] because of my car accident what you got
[4753.60 - 4756.96] from your car accident you had surgeons
[4755.52 - 4758.88] work on you you had
[4756.96 - 4760.08] you had orthopedic doctors work on you
[4758.88 - 4763.52] you had massage
[4760.08 - 4765.44] five times a week
[4763.52 - 4767.12] because i've seen this out there i've
[4765.44 - 4768.80] seen some people who are on the scene
[4767.12 - 4769.84] and they're like lecturing and lecturing
[4768.80 - 4771.52] and they're talking about how
[4769.84 - 4772.80] their meditation healed them from a car
[4771.52 - 4773.36] accident i'm like you know what i'm
[4772.80 - 4776.64] sorry but
[4773.36 - 4777.76] actually from what i recollect you had
[4776.64 - 4779.92] massage
[4777.76 - 4781.60] five times a week coming to your house
[4779.92 - 4783.36] and you had orthopedic surgeons and you
[4781.60 - 4785.44] had doctors and you were you were
[4783.36 - 4786.96] you had nuts and bolts put into you and
[4785.44 - 4788.32] you were put you were glued together
[4786.96 - 4791.84] after your car accident you're trying to
[4788.32 - 4791.84] tell me that your meditation did that
[4797.68 - 4802.32] yeah the way
[4800.80 - 4804.16] here's how it works with meditation
[4802.32 - 4805.84] which i love it's really a powerful tool
[4804.16 - 4807.60] meditation heals the soul
[4805.84 - 4809.20] and her soul can be fractured your soul
[4807.60 - 4810.40] you can get the betrayal and you can get
[4809.20 - 4812.08] all that
[4810.40 - 4814.48] but meditation is not going to remove
[4812.08 - 4815.92] the acid out of your bloodstream you
[4814.48 - 4818.24] have to cleanse that so i just
[4815.92 - 4819.68] the reason why i go into this topic
[4818.24 - 4821.68] because someone's going to say i don't
[4819.68 - 4825.68] need to cleanse
[4821.68 - 4827.60] i don't need a cleanse aw
[4825.68 - 4829.28] i can just i can just do some deep
[4827.60 - 4830.48] breathing and meditation and i can fix
[4829.28 - 4831.84] my problems
[4830.48 - 4833.44] i don't need a cleanse i don't need to
[4831.84 - 4834.88] do the medical medium morning cleanse i
[4833.44 - 4835.52] don't need to do a heavy metal detox
[4834.88 - 4837.20] cleanse
[4835.52 - 4840.00] you can't get the toxic heavy metals out
[4837.20 - 4840.00] with meditation
[4841.28 - 4847.84] you can't you can't get
[4844.56 - 4851.52] mercury out of your brain so you get rid
[4847.84 - 4853.92] of your condition you can't get copper
[4851.52 - 4856.16] out of your liver to get rid of your
[4853.92 - 4857.60] eczema psoriasis by doing meditation
[4856.16 - 4860.80] it's just
[4857.60 - 4862.24] the lay of the land medical medium
[4860.80 - 4864.16] information has a street cred where
[4862.24 - 4867.28] millions worldwide have healed
[4864.16 - 4868.16] physically because you have to take some
[4867.28 - 4869.76] steps
[4868.16 - 4871.44] and the medical media morning cleanse is
[4869.76 - 4873.28] one step
[4871.44 - 4874.48] taking care of your skeletons another by
[4873.28 - 4878.48] getting the acids out
[4874.48 - 4879.92] so your teeth don't crumble and fall out
[4878.48 - 4881.76] and your bones don't get brittle and

[4985.92 - 4990.64] neurological lyme thinking that it was
[4988.08 - 4992.40] all in their head and they just needed
[4990.64 - 4993.60] they just needed to just do you know a

[5025.76 - 5028.72] want to heal from neurological lyme
[5027.52 - 5030.56] you've got to actually
[5028.72 - 5032.00] learn what's what really is going on and
[5030.56 - 5033.60] how to heal
[5032.00 - 5035.60] and yeah you've got to do your
[5033.60 - 5037.44] meditations to keep your soul strong
[5035.60 - 5041.52] turn right go to medical mean podcast
[5037.44 - 5044.80] apple podcast check out the meditations
[5041.52 - 5047.36] okay because they recover and strengthen
[5044.80 - 5047.36] the soul
[5049.36 - 5054.96] okay meditations don't get toxic heavy
[5052.48 - 5057.76] metals out of the body
[5054.96 - 5059.20] i just medical meme information is about
[5057.76 - 5061.76] being real
[5059.20 - 5063.36] straight up it's truth it's why people
[5061.76 - 5065.28] heal around the world
[5063.36 - 5067.28] and if i was going to tell you that you
[5065.28 - 5068.48] can meditate your mercury out of your
[5067.28 - 5071.20] brain
[5068.48 - 5072.88] not only would that be such a disservice
[5071.20 - 5076.32] it'd be dastardly
[5072.88 - 5076.32] miss herbs it would just be terrible
[5076.48 - 5079.28] you got to do the heavy metal detox
[5078.00 - 5080.72] movie get the metals out of your brain
[5079.28 - 5082.40] and if you want to say a meditation
[5080.72 - 5084.80] fixed you after you did the heavy metal
[5082.40 - 5086.16] detox movie and it got the metals out
[5084.80 - 5087.68] and you got better but you want to say
[5086.16 - 5089.84] it was a meditation fine
[5087.68 - 5091.52] but just you've got to make sure you get
[5089.84 - 5093.68] the metals out
[5091.52 - 5095.12] and you should credit what's getting it
[5093.68 - 5097.84] out too it's just like
[5095.12 - 5099.12] heavy metal detox smoothie because if
[5097.84 - 5100.40] you don't credit what's getting you
[5099.12 - 5102.48] better you end up hurting a bunch of
[5100.40 - 5103.92] people i've seen people out there
[5102.48 - 5106.08] and i've seen people out there and
[5103.92 - 5107.36] people have told me this too where
[5106.08 - 5109.28] they do medical medium they do the
[5107.36 - 5110.08] celery juice 16 to 32 ounces every
[5109.28 - 5112.24] single day
[5110.08 - 5114.08] they do the heavy metal detox movie
[5112.24 - 5115.44] right they learn how to heal and what
[5114.08 - 5117.12] foods to stay away from
[5115.44 - 5118.64] they heal and then they say it was a
[5117.12 - 5121.12] meditation somebody somebody's
[5118.64 - 5123.20] meditation that did it
[5121.12 - 5124.64] so then that other person says it was so
[5123.20 - 5125.36] then they go do that somebody else's
[5124.64 - 5126.64] meditation
[5125.36 - 5128.08] and then they don't know about the heavy
[5126.64 - 5129.92] metal detox smoothie they don't know
[5128.08 - 5131.68] about the celery juice and they just go
[5129.92 - 5132.88] now they're sick for another year now
