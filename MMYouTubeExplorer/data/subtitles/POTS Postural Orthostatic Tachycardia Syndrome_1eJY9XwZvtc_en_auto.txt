[1.14 - 5.58] I'm reading out a brain saver about pots
[3.60 - 7.68] a lot of people live with pots now the
[5.58 - 9.96] detailed information is so comprehensive
[7.68 - 11.10] inside brain saver it's mind-blowing so
[9.96 - 13.80] I'm going to read a little bit to you
[11.10 - 16.56] right now people living with pots really
[13.80 - 18.96] struggle the unpredictability of pots
[16.56 - 21.54] symptoms can be maddening for many in
[18.96 - 24.06] most cases of pots it takes months to
[21.54 - 26.16] years of Doctor shopping to get
[24.06 - 27.54] validation for their symptoms and that's
[26.16 - 29.70] what I see out there all the time with
[27.54 - 32.58] pots all these years it takes doctor
[29.70 - 34.98] after doctor after doctor to finally get
[32.58 - 37.62] some doctor some professionals say I
[34.98 - 41.22] think you have pots ma'am
[37.62 - 43.38] because of these symptoms is byproducts
[41.22 - 45.24] and toxins built up in a stagnant
[43.38 - 46.74] sluggish liver being released and
[45.24 - 49.56] collecting around heart valves so check
[46.74 - 52.98] this out so in a stagnant sluggish liver
[49.56 - 55.14] right here all these toxins build up and
[52.98 - 57.54] then they finally get released out of
[55.14 - 60.26] the liver and then they collect around
[57.54 - 60.26] the heart
[60.36 - 64.74] pot symptoms go Way Beyond problems with
[62.70 - 66.24] getting up or leaning forward so it's
[64.74 - 69.60] not just about oh let me get up here
[66.24 - 71.94] whoa whoa let me lean forward it's more
[69.60 - 73.40] than that or leaning down because pots
[71.94 - 76.20] is a viral
[73.40 - 78.72] neurotoxin Disorder so I'm talking about
[76.20 - 81.42] viral neurotoxins creamy pots in the
[78.72 - 83.76] brain saver books right now right one
[81.42 - 86.04] reason pots is so difficult is that it's
[83.76 - 88.20] a chronic viral infection in pots the
[86.04 - 91.02] Epstein-Barr virus has been in the liver
[88.20 - 94.14] for a long time so anybody with pots
[91.02 - 96.48] anybody with pot symptoms they have the
[94.14 - 99.30] Epstein-Barr virus sitting inside their
[96.48 - 101.46] liver not for a short amount of time in
[99.30 - 105.00] their life not for a month but more than
[101.46 - 106.86] a year in fact years years in pots the
[105.00 - 109.20] Epstein-Barr virus sits in the liver for
[106.86 - 111.60] years and collects neurotoxins that
[109.20 - 113.88] cause pot symptoms ranging from the
[111.60 - 116.34] dizziness people go through right and
[113.88 - 117.90] then the difficulty with exercising and
[116.34 - 119.94] that's one of the reasons why they get
[117.90 - 122.70] the diagnosis of pots because they say
[119.94 - 125.04] the doctor oh I can't exercise because I
[122.70 - 127.56] get dizzy I get lightheadedness I faint
[125.04 - 129.90] I get fatigue I get the brain fog nausea
[127.56 - 132.36] chest pain the blurred vision the racing
[129.90 - 134.48] heart unstable blood pressure when the
[132.36 - 137.22] liver is stagnant and sluggish
[134.48 - 140.40] overburdened and filled with years worth
[137.22 - 142.26] of viral toxins various areas of the
[140.40 - 144.90] liver become blocked that's a whole
[142.26 - 148.50] nother problem with pots
[144.90 - 150.48] areas of the VIS the liver actually get
[148.50 - 152.34] blocked so you might get a blocked
[150.48 - 154.44] section of the liver that means the
[152.34 - 158.04] blood vessels inside the liver tissue
[154.44 - 160.02] get clogged up with byproduct from the
[158.04 - 162.54] Epstein-Barr virus
[160.02 - 165.00] this makes it harder for blood to get
[162.54 - 167.16] drawn through the liver to get to the
[165.00 - 169.26] heart putting the heart under a
[167.16 - 171.66] continual strain so here it goes your
[169.26 - 174.72] heart is trying to pump all the blood
[171.66 - 177.00] from your liver up into it but when the
[174.72 - 178.56] liver is stagnant sluggish and blocked
[177.00 - 181.20] in certain areas and that's the whole
[178.56 - 183.78] thing with pots and people have pots the
[181.20 - 185.88] liver is blocked in certain areas so
[183.78 - 189.24] then when the heart is sitting here
[185.88 - 192.84] trying to pump and pump and pump it
[189.24 - 195.48] can't do its job it's struggling and
[192.84 - 197.64] this brings us into pot symptoms right
[195.48 - 199.80] pot symptoms so here you got your liver
[197.64 - 201.66] it's blocked in certain areas
[199.80 - 204.06] and here's your heart and it's pumping
[201.66 - 206.82] it's pumping away like this right
[204.06 - 209.40] but it's pumping harder people with pots
[206.82 - 211.86] can feel their heart beat sometimes
[209.40 - 213.60] pulsing through their like neck through
[211.86 - 216.48] their ear through the side of their face
[213.60 - 218.58] their forehead in their throat somewhere
[216.48 - 220.56] or in their chest more or when they're
[218.58 - 222.36] laying down in bed people that are on
[220.56 - 223.92] mattress Island they've been laying
[222.36 - 225.78] there for a long time for a lot of hours
[223.92 - 227.94] during the day or on the couch Island
[225.78 - 229.44] because they're not well you can feel
[227.94 - 231.72] the heart and then you're telling your
[229.44 - 233.64] doctor well I feel like my heart doing
[231.72 - 235.68] something or I feel heart pressure and
[233.64 - 239.70] what happens is that's the heart working
[235.68 - 242.46] hard trying to get blood up through a
[239.70 - 244.86] stagnant liver when certain areas of the
[242.46 - 247.80] stagnant liver are blocked blood vessels
[244.86 - 250.98] are blocked to a degree with neurotoxins
[247.80 - 253.14] and toxins from the Epstein for our
[250.98 - 254.88] virus so we're reading the pots we're
[253.14 - 257.28] right here in brain saver books you guys
[254.88 - 259.14] order them when you get a chance you
[257.28 - 262.02] will be surprised when you start reading
[259.14 - 263.84] these really eye-opening
[262.02 - 266.40] so we'll go into this a little bit more
[263.84 - 268.50] viral neurotoxins are also floating
[266.40 - 270.00] around so here's another thing so many
[268.50 - 271.76] people who are pots they have these
[270.00 - 275.10] viral neurotoxins floating around
[271.76 - 278.10] saturating and inflaming the vagus
[275.10 - 280.32] nerves whole other problem so then you
[278.10 - 282.42] have all of these neurotoxins that are
[280.32 - 285.32] floating around and when they float
[282.42 - 287.64] around they land on sensitive nerves
[285.32 - 289.62] vagus nerves so the vagus nerves coming
[287.64 - 291.66] out of the brain stem right here coming
[289.62 - 293.64] out going through the body and what
[291.66 - 296.58] happens is these neurotoxins land on the
[293.64 - 298.98] vagus nerves and start to swell the
[296.58 - 300.90] nerves and now the person with pots has
[298.98 - 302.16] the dizziness they have a little bit of
[300.90 - 304.02] the vertigo they have all these other
[302.16 - 306.42] issues going on because their vagus
[304.02 - 308.58] nerves are inflamed
[306.42 - 311.34] so let's keep on going there's so much
[308.58 - 314.16] detail comprehensive information about
[311.34 - 316.02] illnesses in brain saver it'll blow your
[314.16 - 318.24] mind but that's the whole point you
[316.02 - 319.92] become an expert when you have this much
[318.24 - 323.04] detailed information that no one else
[319.92 - 325.14] has you become the expert you control
[323.04 - 327.30] your health when you become the expert
[325.14 - 330.60] which is really powerful
[327.30 - 332.82] if the vagus nerves are inflamed higher
[330.60 - 335.34] up let's go into that right here so if
[332.82 - 338.76] your vagus nerves are inflamed higher up
[335.34 - 342.78] heading to the brain stem down in here
[338.76 - 344.94] right if that happens let's go let's go
[342.78 - 346.80] find that spot then we get different
[344.94 - 348.48] symptoms that's a whole other problem
[346.80 - 350.36] that occurs so if the vagus nerves are
[348.48 - 353.22] inflamed higher up closer to the brain
[350.36 - 355.28] that inflammation on the vagus nerves
[353.22 - 357.84] from the neurotoxins can create symptoms
[355.28 - 359.10] when someone is just getting out of bed
[357.84 - 361.62] so let's go into that for a minute
[359.10 - 365.40] you're laying in bed it's time to get up
[361.62 - 367.38] you get up and boom you're hit you feel
[365.40 - 369.36] kind of weak you're not feeling that
[367.38 - 370.74] strong your legs kind of feel like
[369.36 - 372.54] they're being weighed down you're
[370.74 - 374.22] getting kind of heart symptoms you feel
[372.54 - 377.04] like you're getting a little tachycardia
[374.22 - 379.32] that can happen too that that's what
[377.04 - 381.72] happens when the vagus nerves higher up
[379.32 - 384.18] are getting inflamed
[381.72 - 385.86] and there's so much information I can go
[384.18 - 387.36] on and on in here that's incredible so
[385.86 - 389.46] let's go into this part
[387.36 - 391.44] okay that inflammation from those
[389.46 - 392.76] neurotoxins can create symptoms when
[391.44 - 395.64] someone is just getting out of bed
[392.76 - 397.80] picking themselves up off the ground do
[395.64 - 399.90] you have pots has that ever happened to
[397.80 - 402.18] you where you actually pick yourself off
[399.90 - 404.88] the ground and you get hit you're like
[402.18 - 407.64] boom standing up quickly you bend down
[404.88 - 409.68] and you stand up quickly bending down
[407.64 - 411.12] right you try to climb up a hill or if
[409.68 - 412.92] you're trying to actually climb up a
[411.12 - 415.14] hill that's another thing exerting
[412.92 - 417.90] yourself in any way for some people it
[415.14 - 419.40] feels like having sandbags on their legs
[417.90 - 422.46] where they're walking and you feel like
[419.40 - 425.40] you have sandbags on your legs full body
[422.46 - 427.08] weakness your arms feel really weak or
[425.40 - 429.42] even feeling like you're about to
[427.08 - 432.30] collapse that's what so many people go
[429.42 - 434.72] through everybody's pot symptoms vary
[432.30 - 437.66] because everybody's immune system varies
[434.72 - 441.66] everybody's viral load
[437.66 - 444.54] varies everybody's viral mutations of
[441.66 - 449.48] the Epstein-Barr vary and everyone's
[444.54 - 452.46] liver capacity for the toxins varies
[449.48 - 454.74] that varies your symptom and you know
[452.46 - 456.78] what's interesting all these years you
[454.74 - 459.18] don't see any of that information out
[456.78 - 460.92] there you don't get the details you
[459.18 - 464.52] can't become an expert when you don't
[460.92 - 467.34] know why you're sick it's in here and it
[464.52 - 469.14] is packed really packed
[467.34 - 471.18] so let's go a little bit further because
[469.14 - 473.94] we can keep on going
[471.18 - 475.98] often these days people don't get a pots
[473.94 - 478.62] diagnosis by itself isn't that weird
[475.98 - 480.24] isn't that funny so if you had a pots
[478.62 - 482.70] diagnosis you got pots and something
[480.24 - 485.34] else you've got pots this this this and
[482.70 - 487.14] this someone with pots has often seen
[485.34 - 489.48] multiple doctors and received other
[487.14 - 492.00] diagnoses have you gotten like another
[489.48 - 493.50] diagnosis so you were actually pots and
[492.00 - 497.10] then you got another diagnosis for like
[493.50 - 501.24] another different condition often pots
[497.10 - 502.98] gets wrapped up into Lyme disease some
[501.24 - 505.20] of you guys probably had that like with
[502.98 - 507.48] it fibromyalgia where you've got
[505.20 - 510.30] fibromyalgia diagnosis and a pots
[507.48 - 511.86] diagnosis lupus a lupus diagnosis in a
[510.30 - 515.40] pot's diagnosis
[511.86 - 517.92] vertigo diagnosis mecfs or chronic
[515.40 - 519.60] fatigue because someone is experienced
[517.92 - 521.22] various symptoms when you when you're
[519.60 - 523.38] dealing with pots you could also be
[521.22 - 526.44] dealing with all these other symptoms so
[523.38 - 528.42] when you go Doctor shopping you get a
[526.44 - 530.88] bunch of different labels to take home
[528.42 - 532.92] you know instead of your bag of goodies
[530.88 - 534.90] or your haul for different shoes and
[532.92 - 537.00] clothes and other things are food at the
[534.90 - 539.70] grocery store you come back from your
[537.00 - 541.68] doctor shopping with a haul of diagnoses
[539.70 - 544.56] and labels okay
[541.68 - 546.72] the distinction is that in pots the
[544.56 - 548.52] liver is more stagnant and sluggish more
[546.72 - 551.82] overloaded with neurotoxins then here's
[548.52 - 553.92] the thing that's the whole point how do
[551.82 - 555.96] you even know the difference of what
[553.92 - 558.06] this symptom is that condition the
[555.96 - 561.18] details in here matter that's how
[558.06 - 564.36] incredible it is it's telling you right
[561.18 - 566.88] now the difference the distinction is
[564.36 - 569.94] that in pots the liver is more stagnant
[566.88 - 572.70] and sluggish it's not getting sluggish
[569.94 - 574.68] more overloaded with neurotoxins which
[572.70 - 576.90] means that certain areas of the vagus
[574.68 - 579.48] nerves and up more are puffed out and
[576.90 - 581.58] inflamed the more you have toxins and
[579.48 - 583.86] poisons and neurotoxins inside the liver
[581.58 - 587.66] the more the vagus nerves are going to
[583.86 - 590.40] Puff out causing more inflammation
[587.66 - 593.46] bringing you to all kinds of things so
[590.40 - 595.62] when you do certain moves like movements
[593.46 - 597.66] exertion
[595.62 - 599.52] um Can it can prompt dizziness
[597.66 - 601.38] lightheadedness vertigo struggle or
[599.52 - 603.78] breathing or tachycardia the combination
[601.38 - 605.76] of a liver that has blockages Along With
[603.78 - 608.34] viral infections creates the
[605.76 - 611.94] unpredictability this is just scratching
[608.34 - 615.18] the surface the pots protocol is in the
[611.94 - 617.84] protocols book the pots information is
[615.18 - 622.32] in brain saver but it's more than that
[617.84 - 625.68] seven heavy metal detox cleanses brain
[622.32 - 628.38] shot therapies if new tool too from
[625.68 - 631.02] medical medium information when you get
[628.38 - 632.88] these books you become the expert and
[631.02 - 634.92] that's how you become empowered I've
