series

192
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,639
and this book has an incredible track

193
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
record also

194
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,479
plague info in here so plague info

195
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,199
okay really important to know about the

196
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,840
plague

197
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,599
about info needed it's in here

198
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
you guys if you just got on i know

199
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,520
people are just getting on everything

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,880
making the

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,599
medical medium heavy metal detox

202
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
smoothie and

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,960
making some celery juice we're going to

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,000
do that too

205
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,560
we'll get through this okay let's read a

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,520
little

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
let's get into this

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:16,560
all right right so

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,599
specifically adhd and autism

210
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,240
are born primarily mercury

211
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
plus aluminum that settles in the

212
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
brain's

213
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
midline cerebral canal which divides the

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,520
left cerebral

215
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,160
hemisphere from the right okay

216
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
just wanna talk about that and lo and

217
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
behold we

218
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,840
have a brain i'm gonna bring another

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,720
brain over here too but i just wanna

220
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,080
show you here

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,800
all right that's half a brain in my in

222
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,240
my demo

223
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,120
all right and the midline canal

224
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
you'll see right here good old midline

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,039
canal

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,759
right there okay and i want to show you

227
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,879
and that's adding the other half of the

228
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,039
brain

229
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:06,160
in there okay so the other half

230
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,759
and so that midline canal goes right

231
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
down the middle i don't know if you can

232
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,160
see right down the middle there

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,960
so right in the center that midline

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
canal

235
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,160
dividing the hemisphere with the right

236
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,599
hemisphere

237
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,120
okay and in that midline canal

238
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,680
is where the metals gather

239
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
when you're a child right from the

240
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
beginning

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,399
and what gathers in there is mercury

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
and aluminum that's what gathers in

243
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,680
between that good line canal

244
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
really important to know so taking the

245
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,399
other half of the brain off right there

246
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,959
i want to show you i'm gonna read a

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,959
little bit more

248
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,720
okay the mercury and the aluminum can

249
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,600
also be in other

250
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
areas of the brain other areas of the

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,040
brain sprinkled about in smaller

252
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,240
deposits

253
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:04,160
some even inside the emotional

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,760
center of the brain all right

255
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,040
so the metal doesn't have to be in the

256
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,640
midline

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,440
right but it but that's where most of it

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,279
gathers

259
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,080
especially young um as a child as a baby

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
and then child and then there's also

261
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,720
metals

262
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,880
that get sprinkled about in the brain

263
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
too and that happens as well

264
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,800
um you guys just got on here just doing

265
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
a little demo

266
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,839
on the brain talking about the new

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
addition

268
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
talking about autism adhd gonna make

269
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,399
celery juice

270
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
to make the medical medium heavy metal

271
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,240
detox smoothie so you can have

272
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,600
deposits sprinkled all over the brain

273
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
there's a couple of deposits right here

274
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
you see

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,200
these are big deposits and that's not

276
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,959
what it looks like that's just for the

277
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,000
model so you guys can see that the shiny

278
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,120
deposits right there

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
let's keep reading a little bit and in

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,600
the emotional center of the brain is

281
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,120
where a lot of metal

282
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,959
can also sprinkle about which

283
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
makes things difficult all on a whole

284
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,160
other level

285
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
it might occur to you that it's hard to

286
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,320
build up significant

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,279
exposure to toxic heavy metals in just a

288
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
few years

289
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,640
of a young life like where did all the

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
metals come from

291
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
where do they come from how does it

292
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
happen

293
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,440
you know people think about that like

294
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
how does my baby have metals

295
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,800
how is that even possible how does my

296
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,000
child have metals

297
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,920
this doesn't even make any sense right

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,800
okay mercury however is a neurotoxin

299
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,320
that slips

300
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,760
under the doctor's noses

301
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,959
mercury slips under

302
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,519
the doctor's noses

303
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,959
really important to know right there

304
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,839
most doctors

305
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,240
are oblivious oblivious

306
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
to which medical treatments they offer

307
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,040
that contain

308
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,480
mercury we'll just do this

309
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,839
pharmaceutical here

310
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,000
what mercury i don't know about any

311
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,040
mercury

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,480
what mercury there's no mercury in this

313
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
pharmaceutical right here

314
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,959
um all right

315
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
let's keep on going here so most doctors

316
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,680
are oblivious to which medical

317
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
treatments they offer that contain

318
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,640
mercury

319
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,680
and if they are aware of it they're

320
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,839
either in denial

321
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,200
yeah afraid to break traditional

322
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,839
protocol

323
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,240
or they believe in the treatment and

324
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,160
that belief overrides their common sense

325
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
about the nature of the toxic heavy

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,240
metals

327
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,839
medical communities are due for a

328
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,800
massive wake-up call

329
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,399
about obvious mercury contamination

330
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
there's no mercury no more

331
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,480
doesn't exist what that was what

332
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,240
hundreds of years ago mercury

333
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
that's not anywhere it's everywhere

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,560
mercury is a great instigator of adhd

335
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:05,360
oh is it ever and autism too

336
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
especially in children in the 21st

337
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
century

338
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,399
why why or

339
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,680
how is it possible we have so much

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,040
mercury now

341
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,800
in the 21st century how's that possible

342
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:24,079
how is it uh mercury's toxic it was gone

343
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,079
a long time ago

344
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,760
mercury is also responsible for most

345
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,880
seizure disorders

346
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,839
seizure disorders responsible for most

347
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,240
seizure disorders okay until mercury and

348
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,839
aluminum are addressed the conditions

349
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,320
will continue to affect

350
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,279
millions of new kids each year how's

351
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
that possible

352
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:54,639
millions of kids each year

353
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,880
not 50 years ago

354
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,880
this year last year

355
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
it's very easy for a baby to take in

356
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,040
toxic heavy metals from her or his

357
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,519
mother while in the womb

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,480
yeah and for a father to pass along

359
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,800
toxic heavy metals at conception

360
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,360
that's because the parents have likely

361
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,279
accumulated mercury over the decades

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,600
and so did their mothers and fathers

363
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,440
before them and mercury tends to stay in

364
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,600
the family bloodline generation after

365
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
generation

366
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,000
which i got something to say i got

367
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,040
something to say you guys

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,639
i got big time in some cases for

369
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,800
centuries unless specific

370
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,480
steps are taken to remove it um

371
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,399
i just got to read that one more time

372
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,440
like i'm like i'm trying to think here

373
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,440
i'm like scratching my head about this

374
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
right about this i'm like scratching my

375
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,800
head over here

376
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,639
all right so that's because the parents

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
have likely accumulated mercury over

378
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
decades and so did their mothers and

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,279
fathers before them

380
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
and mercury tends to stay in the family

381
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,160
bloodline

382
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,160
generation after generation

383
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,240
um so

384
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,839
every time someone's sick and they have

385
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
a problem doesn't matter what it is it's

386
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,120
genes

387
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
everybody just says genes so the medical

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,920
industry

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,920
and health professionals around the

390
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
world they'll just say it's genes right

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
research in science will tell you it's

392
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
genes mercury

393
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,279
is passed down generation after

394
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,720
generation after generation

395
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,279
after generation and

396
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,839
no one wants to ever look at that got to

397
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,320
put a

398
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,000
blind eye to that oblivious to it and

399
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
call it genes

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,560
that's what's wrong your genes went bad

401
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,639
won't talk about any mercury god forbid

402
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,279
your genes went bad genetics are not

403
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,040
behind adhd and autism and i tell you i

404
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,160
i swear to god

405
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,079
every time i hear a doctor coming

406
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
straight out of med school brand new a

407
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,920
hot dog like oh i just got out of med

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
school so i know everything

409
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
i know why millions of women have

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,240
suffered i know why hundreds of

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,320
thousands of women have

412
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,600
have lost their lives to lyme disease

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,680
they don't know any of this stuff

414
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
they don't have any any experience right

415
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,720
they coming out they come out

416
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,240
they come out with no experience okay

417
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
and they're just like no genes are

418
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,920
behind adhd

419
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,920
gut health is your adhd or genes

420
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,560
or autism is from a from your genes

421
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,759
stephanie lynn the genes are the

422
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,759
predisposition

423
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,199
the mercury and other things are what

424
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
triggers the genes to become

425
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,040
active problematic see that's a

426
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,160
hypothesis that's a

427
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,639
that's a theory that's theoretical is

428
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,839
what that

429
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,399
is and that's that's also to keep

430
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,079
on the gene narrative so that's what

431
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,360
they need you to think

432
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,199
that your children's genes are bad

433
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,120
and that means your children's

434
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
children's genes are going to be bad and

435
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,040
that means

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,720
you're a bad mom or someone's a bad mom

437
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,839
because you gave your child

438
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,680
bad genes because

439
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,160
that's that's and then then medical

440
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,839
medium information 35 years ago put the

441
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,560
mercury out

442
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,199
the mercury truth and then that spread

443
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,759
around

444
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,839
and now they mix it they mix it because

445
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,560
they take bits and pieces medical medium

446
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
information

447
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,920
the good stuff and they mix it with the

448
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,040
garbage it's still your genes

449
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,720
well maybe mercury's actually creating a

450
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,800
gene problem maybe it's

451
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
triggering a gene problem they can't see

452
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
that there's nothing under any

453
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,600
microscope and i've talked to scientists

454
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,639
i've talked to the best doctors around

455
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
the world

456
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
there's nothing anyone can ever see in a

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,040
microscope

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,399
that shows a gene being triggered by

459
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,320
mercury

460
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
but i i'm happy you're here and i'm

461
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,440
happy you're you're you know giving me

462
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,560
all the info that you got

463
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,079
it's important little wolfie my son has

464
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,120
autism we are doing the heavy metal

465
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,279
detox movie for two years saved my son

466
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,160
now looking in our eyes talking playing

467
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,120
start at school learning his red cheeks

468
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,280
healing

469
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,079
he was allergic to bananas now healed

470
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,000
incredible little wolfy incredible

471
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,760
it's the best thing ever so uh dr faun

472
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,360
md says that's how doctors think

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,839
especially their young

474
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,039
and aren't affected yeah what happens is

475
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,720
that

476
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,160
you got young doctors right you're a

477
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
seasoned doctor right you got the young

478
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,160
doctors coming out and they're they're

479
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,760
they're told science knows everything as

480
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,440
soon as you get out of school you're

481
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
gonna know everything

482
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
and what they find out years after

483
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
experience and years after experience if

484
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
they

485
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,960
if they allow the info to come in they

486
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
find out that science research doesn't

487
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
know anything about chronic illness

488
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
and that they also find out that they're

489
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,160
just left with a couple of theories in

490
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,080
their hand of why people are sick which

491
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,400
is cause unknown

492
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
genes the body attacking itself because

493
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,559
of genes

494
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,240
and that's pretty much it or

495
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,360
they start getting spiritual you know

496
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,960
you get some doctors they're like i'm

497
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,919
gonna start going the spiritual route

498
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,840
start doing some yoga and whoa i think

499
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
i'm creative i think my patients are

500
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,280
creating it with their mind

501
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,799
that's what it is i think it's all about

502
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,240
mastering your mind and that

503
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,600
that's what it is because we don't

504
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,200
science research doesn't know why

505
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
everybody's sick so it must be all

506
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,559
mental

507
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,559
that's what happens all right

508
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,960
so

509
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,640
the cerebral midline canal talking about

510
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
that you guys i got to make the heavy

511
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,520
metal detox smoothie i got to make some

512
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
celery juice

513
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,520
i got by the way this is this this

514
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,720
juicer is incredible

515
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,559
just want to let you know before i

516
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,760
forget it's 50 off

517
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,480
so for the moment anyway um on

518
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,280
megajuicers.com it's the

519
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,039
mm-900 hds but it's got to be that one

520
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,919
it's a celery juicer that's the one

521
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,640
that's great

522
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,280
i told you guys um i'm working with

523
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
these guys

524
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
i licensed my name to them because they

525
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
made the best thing i've ever seen for

526
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,520
celery juice

527
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
the brain's midline is located directly

528
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,080
between the right and left hemisphere

529
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,720
cerebral hemispheres of the brain this

530
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,919
midline

531
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,400
looks like an open canal

532
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,080
so it looks like an open canal so i

533
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,600
don't want to drop this but you see that

534
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,120
open canal up at the top that blue line

535
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
looks like an open canal

536
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,960
the midline looks like an open canal but

537
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
instead of water running through it a

538
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,320
channel of

539
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,360
electrical energy does that midline

540
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,960
canal you guys

541
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
has electrical energy running through

542
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
this and this is really an important

543
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
thing to know

544
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,559
right so your brain is electricity

545
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,760
that's what it is and it's running on

546
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,120
mineral salts

547
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,120
not just salts minerals trace minerals

548
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,919
so it's running on a whole group of

549
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,280
trace minerals okay

550
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,400
neurotransmitters they have those trace

551
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,520
minerals within them

552
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,280
it keeps them strong neurons

553
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
also have those trace minerals and

554
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,960
glucose you got to have the sugar

555
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,480
you got to have the glucose you got to

556
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,559
have the glucose for the brain you see

557
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,280
what that is glucose glucose glucose

558
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,799
we're live

559
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,400
youtube and facebook so

560
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,799
you guys what happens is that

561
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
electricity runs also through that

562
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
midline canal

563
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
a stream of it does runs through the

564
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,880
midline canal

565
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
that's what happens so let me get the

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,200
brain back okay

567
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,400
and you got the brain right there so

568
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
right

569
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
in between right in between this part

570
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,559
and that part

571
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,080
you guys see electricity runs

572
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,080
right up and around that

573
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
so i want to give you that little demo

574
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,280
let's talk about this we're back to

575
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,320
the new edition if you guys want to know

576
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,080
what we're talking about if you just got

577
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,400
on here medical medium revise and expand

578
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
it

579
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,080
the book will blow your mind and help

580
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,320
you heal

581
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
and that's not not it's already has that

582
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,520
track record of

583
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,280
healing people worldwide it's not just

584
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
me saying no the book will help you heal

585
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
kimberly miller your info has saved my

586
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,240
life i cry tears of joy

587
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
being able to have a second chance of

588
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,080
life that that

589
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,480
that means more to me than you even know

590
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
i mean

591
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,280
truly truly means the world to me it

592
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
truly does

593
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,240
so let's go a little bit

594
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,679
a little bit more all right it's not yet

595
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,360
documented in medical

596
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,640
research that this canal forms an

597
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
electrical charge that makes an

598
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,280
energetic connection between the two

599
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,480
hemispheres you guys research in science

600
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,559
doesn't know a lot

601
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
about the brain i mean they got great

602
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,000
mri technology

603
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
that i love out there right it'll see a

604
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,159
dark spot gray spot

605
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,400
white spot it'll find a gray area that

606
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,000
can be identified as a growth or a tumor

607
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,640
mris are great in so many ways okay

608
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,520
but there's little little known about

609
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
the brain

610
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,159
really little known about the brain so

611
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
um

612
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
let's go a little bit more into this

613
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,679
this electrical charge that runs through

614
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,760
the midline

615
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,000
okay makes an energetic connection

616
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
between the two cerebral hemispheres and

617
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,559
allows information to be exchanged

618
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
between them

619
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,080
so in that midline right there right in

620
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
the middle

621
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,280
right right in the middle of the brain

622
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
information is being exchanged between

623
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
left and right

624
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,840
hemisphere so this is an important piece

625
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
of information to know

626
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,559
this exchange of information is powered

627
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,159
by neurons

628
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
and the true nature of this connection

629
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,000
may never be discovered by medical

630
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,520
research

631
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
and science maybe a hundred years from

632
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
now

633
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,480
children have free flowing midline

634
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,679
canals

635
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
and i'm sure a couple of you guys are

636
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
like well wait a minute how would he

637
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,120
know

638
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
research in science don't know well

639
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,559
that's funny because research in science

640
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
is taking medical medium information out

641
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
of this very book

642
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
after it's been published and they use

643
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
it so medical medium information has

644
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,320
never been proven wrong

645
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
it's been it's it's not been

646
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
contradicted by me

647
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,559
okay it's been like it always been for

648
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,039
35 plus years since i was a child

649
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,559
and science research has taken from it

650
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
over the years

651
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,559
and they take it after i've lectured

652
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
about it or published it in this fashion

653
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,360
children have free-flowing midline

654
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,679
canals free-flowing

655
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,120
mid-line canal canals that's what

656
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,960
children have

657
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,640
it's what allows them to learn how to

658
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
communicate with other people

659
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,000
and with the metaphysical realm have you

660
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
guys ever heard of children

661
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,360
being like well i see an angel or i'm

662
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,480
talking to an angel or

663
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,480
mommy i see something you know

664
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:36,159
or imaginary friend or invisible friend

665
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:41,919
or children that see and hear more

666
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,919
right that midline canal is free-flowing

667
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
including the you know angels things

668
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,400
that adults

669
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,720
don't see fairies angels

670
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,080
uh mystical things you know in the

671
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
garden

672
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,039
where mommy didn't see it but but but a

673
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,600
three-year-old sees it

674
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,960
when toxic heavy metals enter this

675
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,279
midline canal

676
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
which is supposed to be open and free

677
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,400
they block the electrical and

678
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
metaphysical

679
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,000
energetic transmissions between the

680
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,000
cerebral hemispheres

681
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:24,159
so when metals block that midline canal

682
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,520
when metals block that midline canal

683
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,080
it breaks up the electricity it breaks

684
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,000
it up

685
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,799
between communication between left and

686
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,159
right hemisphere

687
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,919
guys if you just got on here i got to

688
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,200
make a heavy metal detox movie and i got

689
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,960
to make some celery juice so we're

690
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,679
moving we're moving

691
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,080
we're moving along talking about adhd

692
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,400
and autism

693
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,559
this challenge is the child's brain to

694
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
develop alternative ways to make that

695
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,320
exchange

696
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
happen adaptation set in and the child

697
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,919
unconsciously begins

698
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,640
accessing areas of her or his brain that

699
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,559
most of us

700
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,480
never use at least not until we're older

701
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,000
metaphysical and electrical energy

702
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,799
struggles to find its way

703
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,960
into uncharted territory electrical

704
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,279
nerve impulses begin igniting neurons

705
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,520
and firing up neurotransm

706
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,799
neurotransmitters onto brain pathways

707
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
that aren't supposed to be explored

708
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,760
until after the person breaches

709
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,880
adulthood so what happens with children

710
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,960
when metals block

711
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,799
that midline canal electrical impulses

712
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
have to go in different places so

713
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,240
so what happens is that midline canal

714
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,919
that's that's half the brain right here

715
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,480
left left hemisphere right

716
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,039
and that midline canal i've shown you

717
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,360
there

718
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,200
when that fills up with toxic heavy

719
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,799
metals

720
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,840
electricity can't flow free anymore

721
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,159
so it has to re-route itself

722
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,440
and when it does it's going down

723
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,240
different neural pathways

724
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:54,000
synapses it has to cross the synapsis

725
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
and go into a different neuron root

726
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
see

727
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
sarah i was just reading this exact

728
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
paragraph of the book

729
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,400
everybody should get the new book hey

730
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,640
sarah thanks

731
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,159
revised expanded new edition awesome

732
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
awesome

733
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,240
autism is essentially more advanced and

734
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,279
complicated

735
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,600
form of adhd it's a more advanced and

736
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,039
complicated form of adhd

737
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,559
see i know the medical system wants to

738
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,960
just put a label on something that's

739
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,480
adhd

740
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,000
no that's autism especially originally

741
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,039
right

742
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,840
that's bipolar

743
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,520
that's there's no in between of all that

744
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,760
no that's adhd

745
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,760
that's autism that's bipolar

746
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,039
i had a few i had a few extra oranges

747
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:57,200
before before i started

748
00:26:53,039 --> 00:27:00,480
that glucose is really good feels good

749
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,279
so autism is a more advanced

750
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,080
and complicated form of adhd toxic heavy

751
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,799
metals are

752
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,480
present at higher levels in the midline

753
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,679
cerebral canal

754
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,600
and gathered in uneven layers this helps

755
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,240
explain why there's an autism

756
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,960
spectrum which wasn't there to start

757
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,279
with

758
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,559
they didn't have the autism spectrum

759
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,640
okay

760
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:27,840
that wasn't there but this explains

761
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,840
why that developed

762
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,200
with the with the syndrome displaying

763
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,159
different

764
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
okay intensities depending on the child

765
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,200
it all has to do with the amount of

766
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
heavy metals in the canal that's the

767
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
whole thing

768
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,200
it all has to do with and the amount of

769
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,159
heavy metals we're gonna make the heavy

770
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,159
metal detox smoothie

771
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,600
and in the positions that they've

772
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,559
accumulated so where are the metals

773
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,880
where are they

774
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,399
what part of the brain is the metal in

775
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
what area of the brain

776
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,240
that all that is it frontal lobe

777
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,720
where is it all this matters is it by

778
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,799
the pituitary

779
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
where is the metal is in the emotional

780
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,799
center of the brain

781
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,799
where is the metal in the brain and that

782
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,799
determines also what's happening too

783
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,279
okay

784
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,480
it all has to do with the amount of

785
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
heavy metals in the canal and the

786
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,600
positions they accumulate with autism

787
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,520
versus adhd

788
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,679
the additional layers of mercury

789
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,279
interfere even more greatly

790
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,279
with the metaphysical and electrical

791
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,720
energy communications trying to cross

792
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,720
the canal

793
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
the small amounts of toxic heavy metals

794
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,159
sprinkled throughout the brain

795
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,559
also have an effect there too so the

796
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,840
metal in the midline canal and the metal

797
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,440
that's sprinkled around the rest of the

798
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
brain can all interfere

799
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320
because i'm reading the revised and

800
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
expanding you guys should have the book

801
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,640
if you don't have the book tell people

802
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,919
you know the description is in

803
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,960
description i mean the link is in the

804
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,240
description

805
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:57,520
go to amazon.com target barnes noble

806
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,520
uh yeah

807
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,120
to understand adhd and autism

808
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,720
imagine the grand canyon you guys in

809
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
book depository too you could find a

810
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,039
book

811
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,679
book depository so you ready to

812
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,320
understand adhd and autism imagine the

813
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,440
grand

814
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,559
canyon there's a symbiotic relationship

815
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
taking place in

816
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,000
and around at the grand canyon right in

817
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
the u.s between

818
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
physical and metaphysical elements

819
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
there's the water running through the

820
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,600
canyon

821
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,159
right the wind rising up out of it

822
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,440
the electrical fields from storms and

823
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,200
the earth

824
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:36,559
and the light and the heat of the sun

825
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,240
all of it combines just so

826
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:44,080
to make the canyon a visible

827
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,559
energetic and spiritual force

828
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,679
the brain's midline canal is like the

829
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,200
grand canyon

830
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,600
in the u.s in this way so many elements

831
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,159
interacting at once to make it work

832
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,039
just so it's just like any canyon really

833
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,159
around the world

834
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,080
a lot of different canyons around the

835
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,200
world with water running through and the

836
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,919
rock on the sides and everything now

837
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,960
what if something altered this pristine

838
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,600
environment of the grand canyon

839
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,399
what if someone started dropping cars

840
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,640
into it

841
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,159
and metal barrels into it you see where

842
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,279
i'm going

843
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,000
everything would change see the grand

844
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:26,720
canyon is the midline canal

845
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,760
in the brain that i was showing you guys

846
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,399
and metal barrels question mark

847
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,559
yeah everything would change wind

848
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,679
patterns would redirect themselves

849
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,120
because they would hit

850
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,120
the metal barrels right

851
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,120
the sun would reflect at different

852
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
angles because it would be hitting the

853
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,919
metal barrels no longer reaching certain

854
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,720
areas

855
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,600
but lighting up other nooks and crannies

856
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,880
that hadn't

857
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,760
seen sunshine for thousands of years

858
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,799
even sound within and around the canyon

859
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
would change

860
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,039
the whole frequency of the place would

861
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,880
be different as the elements adapted

862
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,840
this is what happens when toxic

863
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,600
heavy metals enter a child's midline

864
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,919
cerebral canal

865
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,360
we see the child behaving in ways we

866
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,159
don't expect because

867
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,399
her or his brain is adapting to the

868
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
extra materials blocking internal

869
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,640
communication

870
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,840
it's learning to access different parts

871
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,120
of itself

872
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,760
so that's what happened so i'm going to

873
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,840
make some heavy metal detox smoothie

874
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,039
midline canal like i was showing you

875
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,159
guys okay

876
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,279
right the brain okay midline canal right

877
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,360
in the middle

878
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,519
just like the grand canyon if you put a

879
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,960
bunch of stuff in the grand canyon cars

880
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,799
and metal barrels

881
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,720
everything's gonna change about it

882
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,960
energetically electrically

883
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,240
okay all of it and that's what happens

884
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,399
when all that metal

885
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,120
gets in that midline canal of our

886
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:58,240
children and it does

887
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:02,080
and it does all that mercury does

888
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,840
okay all that aluminum does

889
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,000
so much more info is in there just so

890
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
you know so much more information is in

891
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
this chapter the adhd

892
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,360
um an autism chapter so much more

893
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,039
information you guys i mean i'm just

894
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,000
scratching the surface really

895
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,760
jamie lynn davis hey glad you're here

896
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,679
anthony's info has brought me

897

back to life if you have any chronic

898
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
pain give his information a try you will

899
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
improve and i do

900
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,399
talk about chronic pain i do talk about

901
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,159
tinnitus vertigo

902
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,679
body pain fatigue everything in here

903
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,960
epstein-barr related stuff

904
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,000
lupus fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis

905
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,240
all of it you guys joanna thank you what

906
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,960
juicer do you use

907
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,960
it's the mm-900 hds so

908
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,159
mm-900 hds omega juicers.com

909
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,480
and it is 50 off right now

910
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
it saves people money it saves me money

911
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,519
i've heard other people say that because

912
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,880
they're juicing less celery

913
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,200
i'm gonna juice some celery for you guys

914
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,720
and make the heavy metal detox smoothie

915
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,559
the pulp comes out dry uh maria

916
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:10,960
hey what's going on

917
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,640
honored you're here

918
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,000
see you guys let's do uh let's do a

919
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,120
couple things we'll do a little juicing

920
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,200
real quick and then we'll make the heavy

921
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,039
metal detox moving divine light and it's

922
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,919
important to know the updated supplement

923
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,039
list because

924
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,279
things have changed in the world exactly

925
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,320
okay i don't recommend zeolite for heavy

926
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,120
metal detox

927
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,000
i don't at all they changed they're not

928
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,159
the same

929
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,080
even the one i recommended was only

930
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,399
because dulce was not

931
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,919
available at the time supplement

932
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,519
companies have their free will and they

933
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,559
change things all the time

934
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,000
um you know and and that's that's why so

935
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,960
i don't have any loyalty supplement

936
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
companies because

937
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,120
because they know that they could change

938
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,600
but i recommend the ones that i use that

939
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,120
aren't changed that are good anyway to

940
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,640
do the we're going to talk about that

941
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,080
this is the juicer that i love you guys

942
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,080
like i said it's 50 off

943
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,840
people ask me about what you know i

944
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,039
don't show i show the juicer for a while

945
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,039
and then everybody

946
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,840
will ask like which user do you use what

947

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,920
corella you're correct

1046
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,720
correct pirella's a disaster

1047
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,599
it's a disaster i've seen so many people

1048
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,079
bowled over so sick to death

1049
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,520
barfing their brains out be barfing

1050
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,079
their brains out

1051
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,359
and not just that because it's got

1052
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
bacteria in it many

1053
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,640
many of the batches they just they just

1054
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,680
for years that's happened but that's

1055
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,960
just not one

1056
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,800
that's one reason another reason it

1057
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,640
doesn't get metals out

1058
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,359
it doesn't get done it doesn't

1059
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,079
i like things that work that's why so

1060
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,160
many people

1061
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,560
appealed on medical medium information i

1062
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,280
like things that work

1063
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,640
[Applause]

1064
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,320
yes you can juice other fruits and

1065
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,240
vegetables with this juicer it's just

1066
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,680
that it's incredible for celery

1067
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,920
in the end you can juice anything you

1068
00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:00,130
want with a juicy it's just that amazing

1069
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:08,370
with celery

1070
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:08,370
[Applause]

1071
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,440
[Music]

1072
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,680
dude

1073
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,760
what a lot of people do is um

1074
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,520
there's some serious mlm marketing going

1075
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,079
on with that zeolite

1076
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,599
okay zeolite never got people better

1077
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,880
over the last 20 20 years

1078
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,720
25 years okay it died in fact and what

1079
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,160
happens is people bring things back in

1080
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,400
here they bring

1081
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,240
things that actually died years ago that

1082
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,040
just didn't help anybody and they bring

1083
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,720
it back in

1084
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,480
and they match it to medical medium

1085
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,160
stuff so someone doing celery juice if

1086
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,160
you bring in some zeolite

1087
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,680
you'll think the zeolite is actually

1088
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,640
getting better when the celery juice is

1089
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,359
getting you better

1090
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,320
someone brings in zeolite into when

1091
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,160
someone's actually

1092
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,760
getting rid of those processed foods

1093
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,880
learning to keep eggs away and they

1094
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,320
bring in their zeolite

1095
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
they start getting a little better and

1096
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,160
they think the zeolite's getting them

1097
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
better

1098
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,720
some people bring in the zeolite when

1099
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,240
you're doing the heavy metal detox

1100
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,839
smoothie and that's what marketing is

1101
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
doing so the pyramid scheme right now

1102
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,359
with

1103
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,040
with with the zeolite is you bring it in

1104
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,560
with anybody who's doing the heavy metal

1105
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,079
detox smoothie that's a trick

1106
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,079
that's what they're doing so the heavy

1107
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,079
metal detox smoothie has been healing

1108
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,000
people around the world for years

1109
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,760
without any zeolite and i don't

1110
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
recommend zoi and i don't i don't

1111
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,560
recommend it at all

1112
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,079
and and that's the whole thing like what

1113
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,839
does anthony williams say well he

1114
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,520
doesn't recommend it for a reason

1115
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,960
it dehydrates you and it reduces your

1116
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,800
electrolytes to the brain and people

1117
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,240
with neurological problems

1118
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,040
i don't like zeolite and so um

1119
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,240
and the zeolites now out now what i is

1120
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,760
what i don't like

1121
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,280
so the whole point with the zeolite

1122
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,520
thing and what happened is

1123
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
that they're trying to get everybody to

1124
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,480
do zeolite

1125
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,480
with the heavy metal detox smoothie the

1126
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,640
mechanical heavy metal detox smoothie

1127
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
and that and then they'll just say oh

1128
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,400
you're getting better well it's their

1129
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:58,960

everybody went downhill

1173
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,839
all those decades in health communities

1174
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,839
because what happened was i don't know

1175
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,720
if you guys remember

1176
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,280
but 15 years ago 10 15 20 years ago you

1177
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,160
were sick

1178
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,200
you stayed sick nobody got better in the

1179
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,440
communities

1180
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,040
they went to hundreds of doctors and

1181
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,720
nobody got better medical medium

1182
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,240
information broke the fine

1183
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,079
broke that whole thing that happened

1184
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,760
and got people better and that's what

1185
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,680
happened for the years of work have done

1186
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,240
and what's happening here

1187
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,440
while agreeing anthony when i started

1188
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,960
following mm

1189
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,280
i needed a walker had boat rocking

1190
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,040
feeling 24 7 diagnosed with multiple

1191
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,119
sclerosis and was so sick

1192
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,640
i've recovered so much and don't need a

1193
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,839
walker anymore while agreeing i'm

1194
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,520
honored

1195
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,359
incredible i'm so proud of you by the

1196
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,560
way so proud of you just so you know

1197
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,599
so the trick is bring in this old

1198
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,920
garbage

1199
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,359
that never got people better on its own

1200
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,520
on its own

1201
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,359
bring it in with something that's

1202
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,040
getting the metals out of people

1203
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,720
or bring it in with someone doing the

1204
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,560
celery juice and then say

1205
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,960
the pyramid schemers say it's the

1206
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,560
zeolite it it's really actually

1207
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,280
disgusting what they do and then they

1208
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,599
have 50

1209
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,160
60 100 people marketing and doing it

1210
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,560
like i can't compete with that just

1211
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,960
it's crazy susan walker i use the best

1212
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,640
deal like going in 2004 and i went

1213
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,839
downhill completely susan

1214
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,480
it happened to everybody it happened to

1215
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,119
everybody with zeolite but they they

1216
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,880
brought

1217
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,960
this back by incorporating it into the

1218
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,000
medical medium community

1219
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,319
and that's what they do it's actually

1220
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,359
twisted really when you think about it

1221
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,920
you're not the only one

1222
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,960
that literally went downhill from

1223
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,720
zeolite

1224
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,160
and that's the problem and and that's

1225
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,640
what happens

1226
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,680
i recommended this one gentle one many

1227
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,400
years ago

1228
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,240
because of hoping i can get some metal

1229
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,240
out of an intestinal tract

1230
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,680
and and i stopped because it changed

1231
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,200
everything changes

1232
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,480
and there's a whole bunch of bad ones

1233
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,040
out back then too and at the time

1234
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,400
be open-hearted yes i tried z-light also

1235
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,119
didn't help me either

1236
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,480
that's what happened um i read your

1237
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,760
comments by the way you left a comment

1238
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,760
on youtube right

1239
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,440
a couple comments just really cool um

1240
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,680
you know like like

1241
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
that that's exactly what happened and

1242
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,319
that happened to everybody but here's

1243
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,160
the trick

1244
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,680
now they got social media they got

1245
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,800
marketing uh

1246
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,240
literally an army of people with mlm

1247
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,680
trying to get it into the medical

1248
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,400
meeting community they sit there

1249
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,240
commenting

1250
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,000
all day you need the zeolite with the

1251
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,720
heavy metal detox smoothie

1252
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,119
it's actually like it's disturbing i

1253
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,800
mean

1254
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,079
yeah do what you want you can do that

1255
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
you guys want to use you like do you

1256
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,960
want but i'm just telling what happened

1257
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,560
dino started live scene and mm info with

1258
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,119
eczema

1259
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,720
patient and he started to heal faster so

1260
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,520
an eczema patient and he started to heal

1261
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,000
faster

1262
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,119
because the reason why i don't have the

1263
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,520
lysine right here i want to look for it

1264
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,599
and i know we got stuff to do you guys i

1265
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,680
know i know

1266
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,680
i don't know where my lysine is but

1267
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,880
anyway let me pour some celery juice

1268
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,400
so so it's really kind of

1269
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,079
so yeah stop all your medical medium

1270
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,920
everything including medical medium

1271
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,280
stuff you didn't know you're doing

1272
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,240
because medical medium information

1273
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,240
brought it out into the world in the

1274
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,200
last 20 25 years of the health movement

1275
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,119
30 years

1276
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,040
and you've already adopted if we remove

1277
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,800
all medical medium information even

1278
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,359
stuff you don't know you're doing

1279
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,240
that's medical medium right if we remove

1280
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,400
all that

1281
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,880
and you just bring in all the old crap

1282
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,160
the water ionizer alkaline ionizer the

1283
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
zeolite

1284
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,240
bring it all in the charcoal bring brim

1285
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,599
the bone broth broth bring it in bring

1286
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,960
it all in and keep medical medium

1287
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,280
information out and make sure you do

1288
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,400
your eggs again and everything else

1289
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
and just go downhill you'll end up like

1290
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,359
everybody

1291
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,400
that was 20 years ago and 15 years ago

1292
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,839
where no one in them

1293
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,160
in the healing communities were getting

1294
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,000
better and and it was just doctor

1297
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:14,000
literally devastated with their

1298
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,160

1314
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,400
two cups in here celery juice is a

1315
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,440
complete electrolyte

1316
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,160
it helps to loosen up toxic heavy metals

1317
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,000
but

1318
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,440
also what it does is a complete

1319
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,640
electrolyte

1320
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,119
it it stops the rust of toxic heavy

1321
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,119
metals

1322
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:23,440
inside the brain it stops the corrosion

1323
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,280
inside the brain putting about two cups

1324
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,160
in here

1325
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,119
okay it stops the erosion that's one

1326
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,200
thing it does too

1327
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:36,000
right celery juice also feeds neurons

1328
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,880
really important to know guys i want to

1329
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,520
put some cilantro in here

1330
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,119
right get a little cilantro in here too

1331
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,640
little dolls

1332
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,800
this is the medical medium heavy metal

1333
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,720
detox smoothie i'm making right now

1334
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,079
put a tablespoon you can put a teaspoon

1335
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,559
in there if you really want to that's

1336
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,160
fine too

1337
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,599
put like what seems like a tablespoon

1338
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,280
it's probably like if they crunch down

1339
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,119
it wouldn't be that much

1340
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,119
i got that in there i'm going to pop in

1341
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,280
some orange

1342
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,920
right look at these

1343
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,480
caracaras right these red navels what do

1344
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,160
you think

1345
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,920
right squeeze some orange in there let's

1346
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,079
do that

1347
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,079
you can put the orange in just don't put

1348
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,119
the rind in

1349
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,200
okay look here's how it works with this

1350
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,599
heavy metal detox movie this is this is

1351
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,359
what really has helped people

1352
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,000
not a phantom zeolite not a zeolite that

1353
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,400
goes

1354
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,920
in your stomach and out the end and

1355
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,599
dehydrates you

1356
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,079
this is hydrating it's built

1357
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:41,440
to last in your system to travel far

1358
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:44,640
each ingredient runs off of itself

1359
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,119
kind of like a football team or a soccer

1360
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,680
team

1361
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,280
passing the ball to each other to get

1362
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,480
down the field

1363
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,400
that's what happens here you got the

1364
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,079
cilantro working off the spirulina you

1365
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,520
got the spirulina working off the barley

1366
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,640
grass you get the barley grass working

1367
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,000
off the dolls

1368
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,680
to make like a wrap out of that

1369
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,680
but yes i'm gonna pop some bananas in

1370
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,400
did you guys see nicholas's healing

1371
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,800
story the autism story

1372
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,640
his autism story with his healing with

1373
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,000
uh

1374
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:21,200
on ig got the wild blueberries

1375
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,200
i'm putting two bananas

1376
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,280
in here details matter

1377
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,440
and i'll show you what the details are

1378
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,000
right here

1379
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,359
you got the banana which has the

1380
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,359
potassium

1381
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,680
which is an electrolyte all on its own

1382
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,160
right that's an electrolyte all on its

1383
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,119
own

1384
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,200
okay critical for neurons very important

1385
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,280
for neurotransmitters is potassium

1386
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,359
so that's in here but most importantly

1387
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,119
the bananas in here because glucose

1388
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:54,160
you can't bring nutrients to cells

1389
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,520
to the brain without glucose the brain

1390
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,880
will die

1391
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,200
to start dying five minutes after it

1392
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,760
loses its glucose your brain runs on

1393
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,280
sugar

1394
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:09,680
your brain has to get fed sugar

1395
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:12,720
or it dies there's nothing else to say

1396
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,160
it doesn't get sugar it dies after about

1397
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,960
five minutes

1398
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,640
that's what happens okay and when you

1399
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,880
get your blood drawn you lose all your

1400
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,280
electrolytes you lose your glucose

1401
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,880
and when you do a blood donation you

1402
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,400
when you donate your blood

1403
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,720
they take a pint you know they take 500

1404
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,160
you know 500 milliliters which is

1405
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,319
unbelievable really

1406
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,640
unbelievable that you go into mild

1407
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:39,200
hemorrhagic hemorrhagic shock

1408
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,640
so if i if you guys if you guys if

1409
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,480
you're chronically ill i don't

1410
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,920
recommend donating blood whatever you do

1411
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,720
because you lose all your glucose to the

1412
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,640
brain

1413
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,640
you and i got a podcast coming talking

1414
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,319
about it but if you want to donate blood

1415
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,720
and you're strong and you can you're

1416
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,119
resilient and you've got a constitution

1417
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,319
then i would still you know give them

1418
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,079
only half that amount

1419
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,760
and come back another time to donate

1420
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,640
again it's not like i'm against donating

1421
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,760
blood it's like

1422
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,599
you give them 250 uh

1423
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,400
milli milliliters you give them 250

1424
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,119
milliliters is what you give them

1425
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,480
so let's go a little bit more on this so

1426
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,760
i got the bananas in here i put the

1427
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,880
orange in here you guys

1428
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,640
now let's get some spirulina here so the

1429
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,960
vimergy spiruline is the one i trust

1430
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,880
right now with my family my friends

1431
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,040
people always feel like what does he do

1432
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,440
like what does he do

1433
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,119
showing you guys what i do so i put a

1434
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,839
teaspoon of spirulina in there

1435
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,079
right some emergency v is in victor i am

1436
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,720
as in mary ergy

1437
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,280
pasta one thermogee.com i'm not

1438
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,280
sponsored

1439
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,280
so i'm going to put some barley grass

1440
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,480
juice powder in here too

1441
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,359
teaspoon janette i was donating blood

1442
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,640
often when i

1443
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,480
got the sickest yes because the immune

1444
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,400
system gets removed

1445
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,680
so here's how it works i know we're

1446
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,200
covering a couple different topics

1447
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,200
that's a white blood cell right there

1448
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:05,280
okay that's red

1449
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,520
red blood cell okay white blood cell

1450
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
when you donate blood you're getting

1451
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,720
you're getting mild hemorrhagic shock

1452
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,920
because they're almost taking

1453
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,760
their i mean when you think about

1454
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,680
they're taking 500 milliliters

1455
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,400
okay and that's a lot

1456
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,000
just so you know um and when when they

1457
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,040
take that much they're taking

1458
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,839
your white count with them and when you

1459
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,880
they take your white

1460
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,280
count and then they take your glucose

1461
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,720
they take your glucose right the very

1462
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,720
thing that feeds your brain

1463
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,400
then they take your mineral salts like

1464
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,480
the celery juice i just made right they

1465
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,599
take your mineral salts okay

1466
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,520
they're they're they're robbing all that

1467
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,920
white count that paroles your

1468
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,520
your body to stop viruses and then you

1469
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,280
end up getting sicker and sicker blood

1470
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,880
draws do the same

1471
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,319
and we got to be careful you got to do

1472
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,839
less blood at the doctor's office you

1473
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,720
got to tell them half files i'm going to

1474
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,599
do

1475
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,960
a podcast it's coming this week coming

1476
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,640
up

1477
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,640
and i talk about the blood draw in in um

1478
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,680
what to do like in the new additions

1479
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,760
just so you know so

1480
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,119
important seen people lose their lives

1481
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,400
go down he'll go downhill with their

1482
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,000
chronic illness they keep on getting

1483
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,680
five vials seven vials 10

1484
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,359
vials 12 miles and they just lose their

1485
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,000
life they stay sick for the rest of

1486
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,800
their life

1487
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,640
or they they die or if they have cancer

1488
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,240
they just suck the life out of them with

1489
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,079
all the blood draws and they take their

1490
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,000
immune system while they have cancer and

1491
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,280
literally the system

1492
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,680
is is is very much responsible

1493
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
to people losing their lives that's how

1494
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,440
it's bad

1495
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,960

cilantro they work off themselves

1501
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,160
uh elizabeth no no not normal

1502
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,680
blueberries

1503
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,280
only while frozen yes a fret a fr

1504
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,960
or freshly picked wild blueberries

1505
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,520
otherwise wild blueberries raw

1506
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,640
powder from beemergy correct that that's

1507
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,480
what i would do

1508
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,839
um regular blueberries aren't gonna do

1509
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,079
it they have to be the wild blueberries

1510
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,079
there's a big the details matter to get

1511
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,000
someone better you use the regular

1512
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,960
blueberries you don't get better you

1513
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,760
know you use

1514
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,280
a bad spirulina you don't go as far you

1515
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,319
don't you use it's just this is how it's

1516
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,760
been not that i've

1517
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,000
ever seen always see megan is it okay to

1518
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,040
eat

1519
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,480
fruit while my sugar is high it's the

1520
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,240
fat that's the problem

1521
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,000
so megan you do what your doctor says

1522
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,520
ask you know ask your doctor

1523
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,799
but if if it was me and i had high sugar

1524
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,440
i would lower my fat

1525
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,720
and then that lowers your sugar meaning

1526
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,799
your a1c

1527
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,839
it lowers that sugar profile it brings

1528
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,680
it down you gotta

1529
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,839

1530
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,760

as much as i possibly can

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,559

1585
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,880
detox smoothie you can you can get a

1586
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,559
spoon and get the rest out

you can totally do that if you want

1588
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,559
right out of the right out of the

1589
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,359
container there it's a medical medium

1590
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,839
heavy metal detox smoothie

1591
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:24,880
put that right here you guys the thing

1592
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,480
is with this juicer

1593
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,079
the reason why people save money and the

1594
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,079
reason why i'm saving money

1595
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:34,240
is because it's a small amount of pulp

1596
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,359
for a lot of juice now i showed you how

1597
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:40,079
big that was it was over 32 ounces

1598
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:41,680
and it's dry the pulp is dry and you

1599
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,400
can't get that with any other juicer

1600
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,880
and that's why i love the juicer because

1601
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,760
that's

1602
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,240
half the celery i buy half the celery i

1603
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,960
buy

1604
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,240
so instead of buying two cases of celery

1605
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,480
like i used to have to

1606
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,559
for the week or whatever it was now i

1607
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,799
buy one case right because i juice a lot

1608
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:03,040
of it 32 ounces to 60 ounces

1609
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:06,160
the juicer is 50 50 50 off

1610
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,480
okay so that's it and strain

1611
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,000
the celery juice that's the key always

1612
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,760
strain the celery juice that's the best

1613
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,520
thing to do

1614
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,160
keep that in mind right there straining

1615
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:18,640
the celery juice

1616
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,799
be open-hearted that's so interesting i

1617
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,680
didn't even know that given blood or

1618
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,799
blood draws

1619
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,240
were such a big deal great info uh

1620
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,240
such a big deal i'll just give you a

1621
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,079
quick rundown on that okay

1622
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,680
um critical to know when you're

1623
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,720
chronically ill when you got any kind of

1624
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,280
condition the

1625
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,000
condition can worsen and worsen and

1626
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,319
worsen

1627
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,720
from blood draws and then as you get

1628
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:43,359
sicker from your blood draws

1629
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,680
then they draw more blood it's a trap

1630
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,680
that eventually takes people out

1631
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,079
um and it's really really sad it's the

1632
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,839
biggest problem in the medical system

1633
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:54,480
that's not even being looked at or

1634
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,079
addressed they can send half files

1635
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,680
to the lab and they'll accept them if

1636
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,520
the doctor sends them

1637
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,440
so that's something to keep in mind i

1638
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,920
personally if i got any blood drawn ever

1639
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,280
if

1640
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:08,319
i wanted to it would be two to three

1641
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,960
vials half full half full vials that's

1642
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,319
what i would do

1643
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,400
and then if your doctor wants to order

1644
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:14,079
more tests divide them up and ask them

1645
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,440
can i divide them up and come back

1646
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,359
another day

1647
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,920
and get another two vials or two half

1648
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:22,079
files and then you run that metabolic

1649
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,440
panel or you run that thyroid panel

1650
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,280
or you run or you run your cbc like can

1651
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,640
i get my cbc another day

1652
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,720
which will take another two or three

1653
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,599
vials half files please and you come

1654
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,440
back another day

1655
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,359
this way your immune system there's

1656
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,520
enough of it in your bloodstream

1657
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,640
to keep you from getting virally sick

1658
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,480
because that's what happens

1659
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,559
you get more susceptible to the flu you

1660
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,760
get more susceptible to chronic fatigue

1661
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,520
syndrome epstein-barr you get more

1662
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,160
susceptible to any condition you have if

1663
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,119

eczema is any condition you have worsens

1669
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,400
from blood draws they take too much

1670
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,520

1679
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,599
episode is going to be packed more with

1680
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,520
the information but

1681
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,880
it's not for the faint of heart i'm

1682
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,720
forewarning you

1683
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,480
some of you may want to just not hear

1684
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,040
the the episode

1685
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,720
um if you got if you're sensitive

1686
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,839
because i'm dropping a bomb

1687
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,920
and you're going to have to have your

1688
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,920
seat belts fastened and you're going to

1689
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,440
have to have your lemon balm tea

1690
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,440
that's raspberry leaf right there but

1691
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,760
your lemon balm tea

1692
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,440
traditional medicinals i'm not sponsored

1693
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,319
it's just a tea that keeps natural

1694
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,760
flavors away

1695
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,440
because i've never seen natural flavors

1696
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,319
in this company's teas

1697
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,359
yet or anything natural flavors is msg

1698
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,760
which kills the brain

1699
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,520
