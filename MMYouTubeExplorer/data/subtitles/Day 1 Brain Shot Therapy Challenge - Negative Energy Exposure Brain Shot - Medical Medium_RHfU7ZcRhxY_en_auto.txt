[435.30 - 439.74] at a deeper level in your brain but
[438.12 - 440.76] here's how well there's the incredible
[439.74 - 443.22] part
[440.76 - 445.50] these medical medium shot therapies they
[443.22 - 448.08] build on each other and they start to
[445.50 - 451.50] heal within the very things
[448.08 - 454.98] that they're meant to help you with
[451.50 - 457.44] it's incredible your brain and body have
[454.98 - 460.34] a quick response to medicinals delivered
[457.44 - 460.34] in liquid form
[460.98 - 464.22] your brain
[462.66 - 465.48] by the way we're going to take brain and
[464.22 - 467.04] we're going to juice some brain this is
[465.48 - 468.36] a cadaver's brain and we're going to run
[467.04 - 470.46] this through the juicer with everything
[468.36 - 472.26] it's part of the recipe and you know I'm
[470.46 - 473.88] kidding around
[472.26 - 475.80] but
[473.88 - 478.32] the brain
[475.80 - 481.44] loves getting things that get to it fast
[478.32 - 482.58] and the combination and what these shots
[481.44 - 485.34] are
[482.58 - 490.46] are designed from above
[485.34 - 490.46] to drive right to the brain really fast
[492.12 - 496.14] designed to be highly absorbable in the
[494.46 - 499.02] mouth that's what it is did you hear
[496.14 - 501.42] that you guys designed to be highly
[499.02 - 503.16] absorbable in the mouth think about that
[501.42 - 505.92] for a minute not everything's highly
[503.16 - 509.70] absorbable in the mouth
[505.92 - 511.20] not even water is highly absorbable in
[509.70 - 513.96] the mouth did you know that like water
[511.20 - 516.54] has a process
[513.96 - 519.84] water itself has a process it has to
[516.54 - 523.28] find its way into your stomach and
[519.84 - 525.90] really get absorbed that way
[523.28 - 528.24] these are designed to be highly
[525.90 - 531.12] absorbable in the mouth that's the way
[528.24 - 534.30] they're designed from above
[531.12 - 536.46] because when you put orange with these
[534.30 - 537.90] if you put orange and wheatgrass
[536.46 - 540.36] together it's not going to be highly
[537.90 - 543.60] absorbable in the mouth
[540.36 - 546.06] it's orange wheatgrass Sage sunflower
[543.60 - 549.18] grains garlic then
[546.06 - 551.28] that's when something happens we don't
[549.18 - 553.14] know we don't have the science food
[551.28 - 555.12] science we don't know anything down here
[553.14 - 557.40] about what happens with that but from
[555.12 - 560.16] above
[557.40 - 562.14] I got the promise that that will do what
[560.16 - 564.18] it does and it does
[562.14 - 565.86] like the medical medium books and the
[564.18 - 567.36] information always have that's always
[565.86 - 569.76] pulled through but this is something
[567.36 - 573.20] really important to know
[569.76 - 573.20] it's the combination
[573.60 - 577.86] and what it is and then that makes the
[576.90 - 580.14] difference
[577.86 - 582.42] so designed to be highly absorbable in
[580.14 - 585.78] the mouth these brain shots
[582.42 - 589.02] valuable healing components within them
[585.78 - 591.66] can reach the brain fast it could reach
[589.02 - 593.94] the brain quick that's why these brain
[591.66 - 596.28] shots also work that's a big part of it
[593.94 - 598.02] because they're designed so when you
[596.28 - 602.28] guys take these brain shot therapies
[598.02 - 606.60] that it reaches the brain quickly
[602.28 - 609.24] that's a huge huge
[606.60 - 613.44] huge aspect of your healing that's why
[609.24 - 616.86] we get that relief that instant relief
[613.44 - 619.26] so important these these specially
[616.86 - 621.24] formulated shots have the ability to
[619.26 - 623.64] reset and rewire the brain think about
[621.24 - 626.04] that for a little bit
[623.64 - 629.46] do we need a rewire
[626.04 - 632.22] do we need a reset
[629.46 - 634.44] you could ask yourself that
[632.22 - 638.04] because these brain shots have the
[634.44 - 639.72] ability to rewire and reset
[638.04 - 642.84] the incredible part about from
[639.72 - 644.88] information from above to reset and
[642.84 - 647.64] rewire
[644.88 - 649.38] and then the absorption level of driving
[647.64 - 651.18] it right in the mouth it's already
[649.38 - 655.22] absorbing
[651.18 - 655.22] to the brain
[656.04 - 660.32] already absorbing to the brain
[662.10 - 668.40] just incredible when you think about it
[665.76 - 670.50] okay these specially formulated shots
[668.40 - 674.04] have the ability to reset and rewire the
[670.50 - 677.28] brain but get this you guys to shock it
[674.04 - 678.72] out of patterns while at the same time
[677.28 - 681.60] reducing triggers you guys hear about
[678.72 - 684.00] triggers you can be triggered easy
[681.60 - 685.32] and when you have the negative energy or
[684.00 - 687.12] you're getting negative energy from
[685.32 - 688.38] somebody else you can trigger really
[687.12 - 691.64] easy
[688.38 - 691.64] it's easy to be triggered
[692.04 - 697.02] and the thing is is these brain shot
[694.14 - 698.82] therapies are all anti-trigger
[697.02 - 700.40] that's what they are it's another reason
[698.82 - 703.86] why they work
[700.40 - 706.74] really work though
[703.86 - 710.40] like with confidence they work
[706.74 - 713.28] with Precision they work
[710.40 - 716.40] Angela I felt that change explanation
[713.28 - 718.92] points I gave the anger and the mood
[716.40 - 721.20] shifter shots to my husband that was
[718.92 - 724.86] having a bad night and it completely
[721.20 - 728.34] changed his mood from Angry to happy and
[724.86 - 728.34] joking incredible
[729.42 - 736.64] here's the amazing part
[732.48 - 736.64] it's ingredients from the Earth
[737.46 - 743.16] but no one knew that there has to be one
[741.36 - 745.44] ingredient that works with another
[743.16 - 747.12] ingredient nobody knew that I would
[745.44 - 750.12] never know that in a million years
[747.12 - 752.40] nobody does there's no Alchemist there's
[750.12 - 755.36] no person in health that would ever know
[752.40 - 757.32] this nobody knows that when you take
[755.36 - 760.02] that Sage
[757.32 - 761.58] and you take that and you combine Sage
[760.02 - 763.80] with wheatgrass
[761.58 - 765.90] and then you combine those sunflower
[763.80 - 769.20] greens with the wheatgrass and the sage
[765.90 - 771.00] and then you combine that garlic with
[769.20 - 772.98] the sunflower greens the sage and the
[771.00 - 775.44] wheatgrass and then you combine that
[772.98 - 777.66] orange or Tangerine juice with it nobody
[775.44 - 780.36] knew ever
[777.66 - 781.80] that that would knock the heck out of
[780.36 - 784.68] negative energy
[781.80 - 786.84] or any of the other brain shot recipes
[784.68 - 790.62] were the anger
[786.84 - 793.32] or the EMF exposure or the mold exposure
[790.62 - 795.36] are all the different ones Kim says I
[793.32 - 797.76] was already feeling a change after doing
[795.36 - 800.52] the nerve gut acid stabilizer after just
[797.76 - 801.18] two days in a row and that one by the
[800.52 - 803.58] way
[801.18 - 805.02] that one just compiles on itself and
[803.58 - 807.50] just gets stronger and stronger and
[805.02 - 807.50] stronger
[810.48 - 814.56] on with the miracle of that you know
[812.76 - 815.82] honestly
[814.56 - 818.94] like when I was telling Spirit of
[815.82 - 822.26] Kardashians like these are Miracle shots
[818.94 - 822.26] these are Miracle shots
[822.78 - 829.50] really really profound
[825.96 - 832.44] so it's about anti-triggers it's about
[829.50 - 834.84] shifting and rewiring with this but we
[832.44 - 837.00] would never know no one would know that
[834.84 - 838.80] these are you you cannot just put Foods
[837.00 - 840.48] together and think that it's going to
[838.80 - 842.10] stop a trigger
[840.48 - 844.02] but that's why the information from
[842.10 - 846.96] above is so critical and how this works
[844.02 - 849.24] it's really really special
[846.96 - 851.64] so
[849.24 - 853.38] I'm in the brain saver book
[851.64 - 855.78] I want to read a little bit about the
[853.38 - 858.00] cleanses aspect of this and we're doing
[855.78 - 859.98] that we're 10 days we're 10 days but

[1183.56 - 1188.12] Enlightenment how do we achieve
[1185.36 - 1191.06] enlightenment if we have so much crap up

[1201.74 - 1205.70] are creating Enlightenment we're opening
[1204.02 - 1208.28] the door so Enlightenment can even
[1205.70 - 1210.88] happen right there

[1210.88 - 1217.40] Enlightenment check this out
[1214.82 - 1219.50] wow
[1217.40 - 1221.48] Enlightenment is not about being
[1219.50 - 1224.06] all-knowing
[1221.48 - 1226.34] Enlightenment is the freedom to be at
[1224.06 - 1228.74] peace because you have full control over
[1226.34 - 1231.32] what resides in your brain
[1228.74 - 1233.36] Enlightenment isn't just about all
[1231.32 - 1235.58] knowing
[1233.36 - 1237.56] it isn't just about knowing everything
[1235.58 - 1239.96] that's not what enlightenment is it's
[1237.56 - 1243.08] about having the freedom
[1239.96 - 1245.66] the freedom inside our brain
[1243.08 - 1248.48] the peace and knowing we have full
[1245.66 - 1250.34] control empowerment Enlightenment is
[1248.48 - 1252.08] full empowerment when we have full
[1250.34 - 1253.34] control of what's Happening inside our
[1252.08 - 1256.42] brain
[1253.34 - 1256.42] that's powerful
[1257.78 - 1262.76] that's powerful
[1260.06 - 1264.32] since we don't have control about what
[1262.76 - 1265.52] resides around us to the world think
[1264.32 - 1267.08] about it you guys we don't control
[1265.52 - 1269.00] everything that's happening around us in
[1267.08 - 1271.16] the world we don't but we can control
[1269.00 - 1274.04] What's Happening Here
[1271.16 - 1277.76] and we can use our free will
[1274.04 - 1281.74] and we can actually clean and purify the
[1277.76 - 1281.74] home in which our soul resides in

[1413.08 - 1418.64] telepathic Clairvoyant skills will start
[1416.54 - 1421.04] to surface
[1418.64 - 1422.84] you know one thing that's incredible
[1421.04 - 1427.18] about when I was taking the information
[1422.84 - 1427.18] from above about these brain shots
[1427.28 - 1432.98] when SOC told me that and I remember
[1430.04 - 1434.96] writing that down I was like your
[1432.98 - 1437.12] you mean them
[1434.96 - 1440.62] I was like them
[1437.12 - 1440.62] I just want to make that clear
[1441.08 - 1446.24] and spirit of compassion said yes you're
[1443.42 - 1448.22] not me I said not me them
[1446.24 - 1450.50] of course them
[1448.22 - 1452.54] I said okay okay I'm sorry I'm getting
[1450.50 - 1454.46] the information down and it says in this
[1452.54 - 1457.16] book you're intuitive so you're
[1454.46 - 1459.80] intuitive you're psychic that's right
[1457.16 - 1461.54] all you guys all your psychic abilities
[1459.80 - 1463.34] all of you
[1461.54 - 1464.66] you're telepathic that's right you don't
[1463.34 - 1468.14] think you're telepathic all your
[1464.66 - 1469.94] telepathic right and you're Clairvoyant
[1468.14 - 1471.68] skills
[1469.94 - 1474.26] will grow
[1471.68 - 1477.08] by the way sunflower sprouts you can use
[1474.26 - 1480.08] another micro green Sprout like Spirit
[1477.08 - 1483.26] of compassion says that line can be that
[1480.08 - 1485.24] Line's okay right there so if you can't
[1483.26 - 1488.72] get the sunflower Sprout you can use
[1485.24 - 1491.42] another micro green Sprout until you can
[1488.72 - 1493.64] find a sunflower Sprout they're easy
[1491.42 - 1495.32] also to grow yourself sunflower sprouts
[1493.64 - 1498.02] on your counter
[1495.32 - 1500.06] but there's there's very little leeway
[1498.02 - 1503.00] in these shots that's the one of the
[1500.06 - 1503.84] only places where you can have that
[1503.00 - 1505.58] little
[1503.84 - 1507.50] curve
[1505.58 - 1510.50] because there's something in a sunflower
[1507.50 - 1512.84] Sprout that really amplifies it but a
[1510.50 - 1515.42] micro green still has enough of that
[1512.84 - 1516.74] chemical compound structure but it
[1515.42 - 1518.12] doesn't happen like that with all the
[1516.74 - 1520.90] shots and ingredients they have to be
[1518.12 - 1520.90] what they have to be
[1522.98 - 1528.86] yes you your Clairvoyant skills you're
[1527.00 - 1530.36] intuitive you're psychic your telepathic
[1528.86 - 1531.80] skills will start to surface when you're
[1530.36 - 1533.30] doing these brain shot there because you
[1531.80 - 1536.24] do these brain shot therapies on a
[1533.30 - 1539.72] regular basis and all of that starts to
[1536.24 - 1541.58] come out and starts to surface
[1539.72 - 1544.76] oh man
[1541.58 - 1547.76] you will be able to see truth easily and
[1544.76 - 1551.20] clearly and be able to express yourself
[1547.76 - 1553.58] increase creativity how cool is that
[1551.20 - 1556.04] inexperienced joy in the simplest things
[1553.58 - 1558.92] that others would not realize are joyful
[1556.04 - 1561.68] that's the whole thing experiencing Joy
[1558.92 - 1563.84] on any level in ways that others would
[1561.68 - 1566.48] never think is even joyful that takes
[1563.84 - 1567.86] you to another level right there that
[1566.48 - 1570.76] starts to happen when you're doing these
[1567.86 - 1570.76] brain shot Therapies
[1570.86 - 1577.28] you can use a micro green if you can't
[1573.92 - 1578.78] find the sunflower Sprout but really you
[1577.28 - 1581.42] have to eventually get the sunflower
[1578.78 - 1582.86] Sprout and you can use another Sprout if
[1581.42 - 1585.32] you really have to
[1582.86 - 1588.08] if you can't get a micro green but
[1585.32 - 1591.04] that's the only way we have for the
[1588.08 - 1591.04] negative energy shot
[1594.62 - 1599.56] it's just incredible
[1596.66 - 1599.56] ready for this
[1599.66 - 1606.94] you will open your third eye and develop
[1603.14 - 1606.94] your skills as a seer
[1607.58 - 1611.96] when you rid yourself of poisons from
[1610.22 - 1614.30] the industries that were purposely
[1611.96 - 1619.54] placed in our brains
[1614.30 - 1619.54] to keep us in Chains and keep us down
[1620.66 - 1626.18] you know something what I heard that
[1623.12 - 1628.28] information and I put it in the books
[1626.18 - 1630.26] I was just I was just sitting there at
[1628.28 - 1632.18] my office desk and it was I think it was

[1962.48 - 1966.50] here's how it works
[1964.28 - 1968.84] you may not be the original source of
[1966.50 - 1970.58] negative energy
[1968.84 - 1972.44] no
[1970.58 - 1975.58] are you the original source of negative
[1972.44 - 1975.58] energy no
[1975.68 - 1978.64] you're not
[1978.74 - 1982.76] someone else can be the original source
[1980.90 - 1984.56] of negative energy
[1982.76 - 1986.30] and their whole life's purpose is
[1984.56 - 1989.32] disputing negative energy you guys don't
[1986.30 - 1989.32] know but that's possible
[1989.42 - 1996.16] an industry spreads negative energy a
[1992.42 - 1996.16] person can spread negative energy
[1996.62 - 2003.88] any kind of entity or force can spread
[2000.88 - 2006.94] negative energy
[2003.88 - 2009.34] a group of people can you guys know this
[2006.94 - 2011.50] a group of people can just boom boom
[2009.34 - 2013.30] boom get together even on social media
[2011.50 - 2015.52] and they can spread so much negative
[2013.30 - 2018.94] energy it's unbelievable look what has
[2015.52 - 2021.52] happened when I put out my PCOS post
[2018.94 - 2023.92] like the true cause or my true cause of
[2021.52 - 2026.26] something else like ADHD look at it the
[2023.92 - 2028.12] people they come in like wolves and
[2026.26 - 2029.68] vultures and they're just spewing
[2028.12 - 2031.68] negativity because they want to stop
[2029.68 - 2035.20] everybody from healing right either way
[2031.68 - 2037.06] you you may not be and you're not the
[2035.20 - 2039.28] source of negative energy
[2037.06 - 2040.96] but other sources out there are the
[2039.28 - 2044.58] source of negative energy you have to
[2040.96 - 2044.58] figure this out you have to know this
[2045.16 - 2050.08] you can be surrounded by negative energy
[2047.50 - 2052.42] you can be surrounded by other people's
[2050.08 - 2055.36] demons
[2052.42 - 2057.76] where they got a demon going on inside
[2055.36 - 2059.26] their head and they're saying rotten
[2057.76 - 2063.12] terrible things to you and they're
[2059.26 - 2063.12] texting rotten terrible things to you
[2064.24 - 2071.62] but it's important to understand
[2067.54 - 2074.74] that you are not the source and the
[2071.62 - 2077.08] creator of negative energy someone else
[2074.74 - 2079.18] could be something else could be
[2077.08 - 2081.40] but you need to protect yourself and
[2079.18 - 2083.92] being able to actually shed any that
[2081.40 - 2086.08] could be inside of you Susan says I
[2083.92 - 2088.30] tried the burnout stabilizer and it was
[2086.08 - 2090.94] mind-blowing
[2088.30 - 2093.82] I felt the electricity running through
[2090.94 - 2096.82] my brain it felt like my brain was
[2093.82 - 2099.34] working at a higher level Susan
[2096.82 - 2101.14] because it does after that because it
[2099.34 - 2103.24] does work at a higher level after that

[2282.52 - 2287.56] let's find our negative energy shot
[2285.70 - 2288.46] now let's go and let's talk about this
[2287.56 - 2290.86] for a little bit this is actually
[2288.46 - 2294.12] interesting
[2290.86 - 2294.12] that was a little intermission
[2295.12 - 2302.32] exposure shots that's the category we're
[2298.60 - 2304.18] in right now we're in exposure shots
[2302.32 - 2306.16] okay
[2304.18 - 2309.10] negative energy exposure shot is the one
[2306.16 - 2311.56] we're doing it's day one right now
[2309.10 - 2315.04] let's talk about this these exposure
[2311.56 - 2318.22] shots can be administered before an
[2315.04 - 2320.62] exposure during an exposure shortly
[2318.22 - 2322.96] after an exposure or even days weeks or
[2320.62 - 2325.00] months after an exposure here's the
[2322.96 - 2326.74] thing you can have exposure to some
[2325.00 - 2329.26] serious negative energy not even know it
[2326.74 - 2331.36] now things are going wrong in your life
[2329.26 - 2334.68] it's like you're just you're off beat
[2331.36 - 2334.68] something's going wrong
[2334.72 - 2340.42] you don't remember the negative energy
[2337.60 - 2341.92] that you've been exposed to that was two
[2340.42 - 2344.02] weeks ago
[2341.92 - 2347.26] that was three weeks ago
[2344.02 - 2351.22] but it hangs with us
[2347.26 - 2352.90] so if you do know what exposure you had
[2351.22 - 2355.54] you're like oh my God that person I
[2352.90 - 2357.40] talked to they were just like
[2355.54 - 2359.26] they had to dump all their stuff on me
[2357.40 - 2361.96] they had to dump all their stuff on me
[2359.26 - 2364.12] it was like I had to absorb it all and
[2361.96 - 2365.86] then they finally were cleared but what
[2364.12 - 2367.48] did they dump on me did they dump all
[2365.86 - 2370.54] this negative energy and they dumped it
[2367.48 - 2373.42] all on me and I took it all in
[2370.54 - 2376.42] well that was two weeks ago though well
[2373.42 - 2379.06] you can still do this negative energy
[2376.42 - 2382.30] exposure shot
[2379.06 - 2384.82] you can do it shortly after an exposure
[2382.30 - 2387.04] say you're driving a car and someone's
[2384.82 - 2389.86] like flips you the bird
[2387.04 - 2391.66] and throws your game off
[2389.86 - 2394.18] right you're driving down the road
[2391.66 - 2395.92] someone gives you the finger right some
[2394.18 - 2398.56] road rage happens or anything see
[2395.92 - 2400.36] someone cuts you off because they're
[2398.56 - 2401.98] psycho in the moment like something's
[2400.36 - 2404.02] wrong with them and they just they're
[2401.98 - 2406.12] just angry or something happens and they
[2404.02 - 2407.56] cut you off and throws you off you
[2406.12 - 2409.00] almost get into like a little car
[2407.56 - 2412.12] accident
[2409.00 - 2414.82] it's time to do that shot
[2412.12 - 2417.28] Sammy says oh my God I'm gonna need this
[2414.82 - 2419.86] shot 20 times a day when I go home for
[2417.28 - 2422.86] the holidays laugh out loud actually
[2419.86 - 2424.42] that's actually a really good time for
[2422.86 - 2426.70] the negative energy exposure shot
[2424.42 - 2428.80] because I hear it all the time people go
[2426.70 - 2431.68] home for the holidays people come over
[2428.80 - 2434.68] family comes over and then your siblings
[2431.68 - 2437.26] are all negative and stuff or somebody's
[2434.68 - 2439.84] all negative right and you just you just
[2437.26 - 2441.40] need to protect yourself that's a major
[2439.84 - 2442.84] exposure so you want to do something
[2441.40 - 2444.64] about it
[2442.84 - 2446.50] yeah
[2444.64 - 2448.36] so I'm going through the exposure shots
[2446.50 - 2450.58] now now there's 10 different exposure
[2448.36 - 2452.86] shots to choose from but we are at the
[2450.58 - 2455.44] negative energy exposure shot right here
[2452.86 - 2459.18] I'm excited
[2455.44 - 2459.18] because I'm gonna start making it
[2459.88 - 2464.68] and then we can talk a little bit about
[2461.50 - 2467.08] other stuff about negative energy while
[2464.68 - 2470.58] we're drinking it so let's do it guys
[2467.08 - 2470.58] brand saver books right here
[2473.02 - 2480.52] I'm nervous I'm actually nervous
[2476.38 - 2483.58] my god I've never been really nervous
[2480.52 - 2484.78] but why am I so nervous
[2483.58 - 2486.70] it's crazy
[2484.78 - 2489.40] but I am
[2486.70 - 2491.86] actually nervous
[2489.40 - 2493.42] I'm nervous because I don't know what
[2491.86 - 2495.22] negative energy I might have collected
[2493.42 - 2499.36] because I'm dealing with so much stuff
[2495.22 - 2501.70] but man I'm gonna see it leave and I'm
[2499.36 - 2504.16] excited so you're gonna juice the
[2501.70 - 2506.74] ingredients in order that's an important
[2504.16 - 2508.36] way to do this now if for some reason
[2506.74 - 2510.88] you skip a beat and I want you to know
[2508.36 - 2514.00] this if you skip a beat
[2510.88 - 2515.68] and you juice it out of order
[2514.00 - 2518.08] we're still okay
[2515.68 - 2521.68] but you do want to juice it in order if
[2518.08 - 2524.02] you can that does help okay so it starts
[2521.68 - 2526.42] out with a quarter cup of tightly packed
[2524.02 - 2528.40] fresh Sage I'm just going to gauge it
[2526.42 - 2530.02] because I usually have my own methods to
[2528.40 - 2531.82] gauge you know what's a quarter cup and
[2530.02 - 2534.34] everything else so I have some Sage
[2531.82 - 2536.86] right here
[2534.34 - 2538.54] here it is
[2536.86 - 2539.68] so I'm going to do is get my quarter cup
[2538.54 - 2542.74] ready
[2539.68 - 2546.18] so I'm taking the leaves
[2542.74 - 2546.18] with the little stems
[2546.52 - 2551.20] Lisa do you use the celery attachment
[2548.80 - 2552.88] with the mm-1500 for these shots I most
[2551.20 - 2557.08] certainly do
[2552.88 - 2558.64] you guys this is 20 off CMM 1500
[2557.08 - 2561.16] I'm just going to mention it for a
[2558.64 - 2563.32] moment because the reason why I leave
[2561.16 - 2567.22] the celery juice attachment on in this
[2563.32 - 2570.40] because it squeezes every last drop out
[2567.22 - 2572.26] of that it extracts those phytochemical
[2570.40 - 2573.64] compounds like no other juicer does
[2572.26 - 2575.80] that's why these juicers are that
[2573.64 - 2577.96] amazing if you're looking for a juicer

[2637.66 - 2641.50] right you guys
[2639.22 - 2644.20] so I'm gonna do a quarter cup of the
[2641.50 - 2645.70] sage tightly packed grabbing a little
[2644.20 - 2648.42] bit more
[2645.70 - 2648.42] right here
[2648.58 - 2652.24] I'd say it's about quarter cup right
[2650.50 - 2654.88] there and we're making a shot so I'm
[2652.24 - 2657.28] going to stick that in here
[2654.88 - 2659.26] the next ingredient is going to be the
[2657.28 - 2662.02] quarter the sorry the half cup of
[2659.26 - 2663.70] tightly packed sunflower greens
[2662.02 - 2665.92] so I'll get that ready as I'm running
[2663.70 - 2667.72] this
[2665.92 - 2671.82] and then we'll keep on moving through it
[2667.72 - 2671.82] all right I'm gonna fire this up
[2671.86 - 2677.88] and you can use the Sprouts as well I
[2674.02 - 2677.88] talked about that earlier get ready
[2678.00 - 2682.08] dropping a sage in there first
[2683.02 - 2687.70] boom
[2684.46 - 2690.46] now I'm doing quarter cup tightly packed
[2687.70 - 2691.84] sunflower greens if you want if you you
[2690.46 - 2694.90] could use a
[2691.84 - 2696.34] I mean a half cup you can use a micro
[2694.90 - 2698.44] green
[2696.34 - 2699.70] you can use a sprout if you don't have a
[2698.44 - 2703.00] sunflower green but that's the only
[2699.70 - 2705.76] leeway we have in this this combination
[2703.00 - 2710.46] or it's not going to work
[2705.76 - 2710.46] so I'm knocking this in so a half a cup
[2710.76 - 2714.30] of those
[2715.06 - 2719.44] I'm gonna put a little bit more because
[2717.10 - 2721.74] I want to when you tightly pack them
[2719.44 - 2726.48] it's a whole other game
[2721.74 - 2726.48] okay next ingredient
[2726.72 - 2735.22] wheatgrass so here's how it works
[2730.90 - 2737.86] I'm using Frozen wheatgrass
[2735.22 - 2739.96] for this one
[2737.86 - 2741.88] the best frozen wheatgrass is on my
[2739.96 - 2743.02] directory at medicalmedium.com and just
[2741.88 - 2746.56] letting you know
[2743.02 - 2749.44] and I'm adding it at the end
[2746.56 - 2751.48] okay if you have fresh wheatgrass like
[2749.44 - 2753.70] this I want to show you
[2751.48 - 2755.32] you can juice the fresh wheatgrass right
[2753.70 - 2757.72] here
[2755.32 - 2760.00] so I got the fresh wheatgrass
[2757.72 - 2762.72] so if you guys have that on hand use
[2760.00 - 2762.72] that for sure
[2763.54 - 2767.32] I have a frozen option too because what
[2765.70 - 2769.78] happens is most of you and I want to
[2767.32 - 2771.76] just talk about this for a second most
[2769.78 - 2773.68] of you don't have the option for
[2771.76 - 2775.78] wheatgrass for fresh wheatgrass like I
[2773.68 - 2778.30] do you don't have that option
[2775.78 - 2781.48] so it's so what you want to do is you
[2778.30 - 2783.58] want to use a frozen one the best frozen
[2781.48 - 2785.98] one like I said is on my directory at
[2783.58 - 2789.10] medicalmedium.com
[2785.98 - 2792.06] okay now we're going into it half a
[2789.10 - 2792.06] clove of garlic
[2792.34 - 2797.26] so I'm just gonna clean this garlic up
[2794.38 - 2800.26] for a second knock out a clove
[2797.26 - 2800.26] foreign
[2803.98 - 2808.62] got a little knife behind here I'm just
[2806.08 - 2808.62] getting it ready
[2810.46 - 2813.12] nice
[2817.90 - 2822.46] small garlic cloves so I'm going to cut
[2820.00 - 2824.80] this one in half because this was a
[2822.46 - 2827.08] really big garlic clove dropping that in
[2824.80 - 2828.76] this is the negative energy exposure
[2827.08 - 2831.58] shot if you guys just got here it's the
[2828.76 - 2833.98] brain shot therapy cleanse we're day one
[2831.58 - 2836.34] anybody new coming on I want you to know
[2833.98 - 2836.34] what's up
[2836.44 - 2843.22] okay if you don't have the wheatgrass
[2840.28 - 2845.26] okay the week the fresh wheat grass
[2843.22 - 2847.78] and you can you can definitely use the
[2845.26 - 2849.16] Frozen for sure
[2847.78 - 2850.78] but
[2849.16 - 2852.82] you have to have all these ingredients
[2850.78 - 2855.22] when you do this so you can always try
[2852.82 - 2856.96] to get the ingredients later on try to
[2855.22 - 2858.88] you know search for them and make sure
[2856.96 - 2860.62] you have what you need to do this
[2858.88 - 2863.16] if you don't have it so we're gonna go
[2860.62 - 2863.16] with an orange
[2864.10 - 2870.36] or Tangerine so you've got the option of
[2867.04 - 2870.36] orange tangerine
[2871.06 - 2878.94] I'm going to do a tangerine in here
[2875.38 - 2878.94] I'm gonna peel it actually
[2881.86 - 2888.22] so it's one one to two peeled tangerines
[2886.30 - 2891.24] I'm gonna pop one in there
[2888.22 - 2891.24] maybe another one
[2891.88 - 2897.04] look in the book it'll say still make
[2894.52 - 2900.24] the shot if you don't have
[2897.04 - 2900.24] the wheatgrass
[2901.54 - 2906.72] but at least you know what you're
[2903.04 - 2906.72] building to and what you're looking for

[3204.90 - 3210.50] make two more later now if you want
[3207.18 - 3210.50] let's talk about some options
[3212.16 - 3218.52] this feels so good it feels so good it's
[3216.60 - 3220.50] why
[3218.52 - 3221.88] that's why I've been just walking around
[3220.50 - 3223.80] with these
[3221.88 - 3226.38] because
[3223.80 - 3229.52] that's why I take these everywhere I
[3226.38 - 3229.52] take them into the bathroom
[3230.04 - 3235.88] take them to the kitchen of course
[3232.68 - 3235.88] I have them in the bedroom
[3236.10 - 3239.78] I just have to have them with me
[3240.24 - 3247.80] incredible wait 15 to 30 minutes before
[3244.34 - 3249.84] you do any kind of food eating or water
[3247.80 - 3252.84] drinking wait a little bit wait 15
[3249.84 - 3255.66] minutes give it time let it go to the
[3252.84 - 3259.50] brain and that's what it's doing
[3255.66 - 3261.96] I could feel it right away it absorbs
[3259.50 - 3264.18] into the mouth because of the
[3261.96 - 3266.64] ingredients and what they are and the
[3264.18 - 3271.52] amounts that they are
[3266.64 - 3271.52] they enter into the blood vessels quick
[3272.94 - 3278.76] right into the blood vessels they get to
[3275.82 - 3281.46] the brain fast
[3278.76 - 3284.58] and they're working on the physical and
[3281.46 - 3287.04] metaphysical aspect of your life of your
[3284.58 - 3289.56] brain and your body
[3287.04 - 3292.74] they're working on your soul and your
[3289.56 - 3294.60] subconscious mind and conscious mind
[3292.74 - 3297.24] that's what they're doing
[3294.60 - 3300.60] when these brain shots go in they absorb
[3297.24 - 3302.52] quickly it's how they work
