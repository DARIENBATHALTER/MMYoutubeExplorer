00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
closer right to getting out

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,560
and i went to bed last night

191
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,440
and all i saw was

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,120
like

193
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,840
barley grass

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,560
don't do barley grass juice powder don't

195
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,160
do barley grass barley gras like that's

196
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
how many times i think i said it

197
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,080
yesterday

198
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,880
it's got to be barley grass juice powder

199
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,720
not barley grass you can't get metals

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
out with the barley grass it's not going

201
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
to happen it has to be the juice powder

202
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
because the juice pattern i'll just tell

203
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,919
you

204
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,199
travels

205
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,120
the juice powder it actually absorbs

206
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
assimilates

207
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
that's what it does it gets into the

208
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
bloodstream it travels to the brain it

209
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,360
travels to the nervous system it has to

210
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
be the juice powder these are the

211
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,759
differences these are the details that

212
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
matter in order to heal

213
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
if you don't believe you have metals but

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,000
you're suffering with anxiety

215
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,919
we still got to have it right

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
so we can get the metals out even if you

217
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,639
don't believe it's a metal causing it in

218
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
order to get better the details have to

219
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
matter they have to be right so we got

220
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,680
the barley grass cheese powder right

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,720
and then last but not least we need the

222
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,360
wild blueberries right here

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,360
is it the frozen wild blueberries okay

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,960
that's one option right there you can do

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
the wild blueberry juice which i'm gonna

226
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
grab a wild blueberry juice in a minute

227
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
too

228
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,599
so we need that

229
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
so we need a wild blueberry juice and

230
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,879
then

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
we got the

232
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
we got and if you got a wild blueberry

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,879
powder that's great too

234
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,319
that's great right i'm looking around i

235
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,319
can't find my wild blueberry juice

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
all right so i'm gonna have to just go

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,840
get it

238
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
so we got the wild blueberry juice right

239
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
here

240
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,120
so that's the wyman's one all right so

241
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,919
that's an option there so the five key

242
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
ingredients is critical it's critical

243
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,360
it's cilantro it's spirulina it's barley

244
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,959
grass juice powder it's dulse

245
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
and it's

246
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,959
the wild blueberries right

247
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:45,040
now here's how it works

248
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,200
when you have all five key ingredients

249
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,000
you can get the metals from deeper

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,880
places out of the body

251
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,640
and you can get them completely out of

252
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
the body

253
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,839
and then when you do the cleanse

254
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,240
you're really taking it to that next

255
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,200
level to get the metals out of the body

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
because when you're doing the cleanse

257
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
you're not eating any fats in the

258
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
morning to block

259
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,000
to block the metals from coming out

260
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,680
you're not eating any fats to block the

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,320
metals from coming out we're still

262
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,680
censored on facebook big time you guys

263
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
so we're not that's what happens when

264
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,240
you don't do

265
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,640
the fats in the morning you don't block

266
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
the metals from coming out

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
so that's what's key about it right

268
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
there so if you're not doing bacon

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279

270
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,399
nut butters you're not doing oils you're

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,839
not doing

272
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,200
you know whatever you're not doing

273
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,320
chicken in the morning a lot of people

274
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
eat they're not doing cheese in the

275
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,760
morning you're not doing milk in the

276
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
morning milk butter eggs cheese

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,519
sour cream you're not doing any kind of

279
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
fat in the morning

280
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,800
cottage cheese whatever you're not doing

281
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,959
any kind of fat in the morning when you

282
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,839
hold those off and you don't do fats in

283
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,360
the morning you can get the metals out

284
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,519
if you're doing the actual metal remover

285
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
stuff you got the heavy metal detox

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
smoothie you got that going on like you

287
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
got your cilantro your your spirulina

288
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
broadly grass juice powder your wild

289
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,959
blueberries the whole bit the dolls you

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,720
do that and you're not doing any metals

291
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
i mean sir you're not doing any fats you

292
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
can get the metals out of the

293
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,959
bloodstream

294
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,480
so the reason why the heavy metal detox

295
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,079
cleanse

296
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,000
right

297
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,200
doesn't have any fats in the morning

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,600
it's so

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,399
the metals don't stay in the bloodstream

300
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
and then

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,079
go back into your liver

302
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,800
or go back into your brain or go back

303
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,320
into something

304
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,640
that's how it works that's what's

305
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,440

here's how here's how easy it is

333
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,680
do not do hot water

334
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,320
you want to do hot water

335
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,200
you just lost

336
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,360
boom you don't win

337
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,079
yes you can do lemon in hot tea but

338
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
that's not going to give you the flush

339
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,240
that's not going to help hydrate you and

340
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,200
give you the flush

341
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,279
when you cook your lemon

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
in hot water like

343
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
hot lemon tea

344
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
right

345
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,560
you don't get a flush

346
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
it doesn't hydrate either it doesn't

347
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,320
have that hydration power

348
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,399
this is really important to know

349
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,279
okay so that's what i did i just put

350
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
fresh lemon juice right into this cup

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
just like that

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
okay

353
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,040
amazing

354
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,839
now i'm going to add some water look at

355
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,639
this you can have lukewarm water you can

356
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,680
have room temperature water you can have

357
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
cold water

358
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,040
you don't want hot water

359
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,680
keep that in mind right so there you go

360
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,959
lemon water right there

361
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,720
voila all set that fast

362
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,560
so when you think about how hard is this

363
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
cleanse like how hard is it to do like

364
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,800
what what do i have to do for this

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,320
because i'm not i'm not into anything

366
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
hard to do

367
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,560
yep k says i'm seeing you on facebook

368
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,160
yes of course there's a few people on

369
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,160
there it's just that they're holding

370
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,560
back the other you know few thousand

371
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
easy

372
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
so why not hot water the question comes

373
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,839
through why not hot water

374
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
the reason why hot water doesn't work is

375
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,040
because you kill the phytochemical

376
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,480
compounds the living water because

377
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,839
that's what it is

378
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,480
you kill it

379
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,560
and that's important to know right there

380
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,680
so

381
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,600
if you're if you're using hot water

382
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,040
you lose that

383
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,480
flushing agent that's in it right so

384
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,079
here's how it works

385
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,399
a lemon

386
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,480
is not boiling hot on the tree

387
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,959
so when the lemon's on the tree it's not

388
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
boiling hot you don't go to the lemon

389
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,639
tree and you pick up pick a lemon you're

390
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,639
like oh oh my god so hot oh my god it's

391
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,639
hot well whoa whoa it's hot whoa

392
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,440
you don't do that

393
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,120
so

394
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
you grab it

395
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,880
a lot of times especially when the

396
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,800
lemons are actually on the lemon tree

397
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
it's cool out too

398
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,399
it's cool

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,480
it's around that time of the year where

400
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,600
it's cool okay

401
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,480
so when you you have living water

402
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,440
living enzymes living water

403
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,000
phytochemical compounds that are alive

404
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,040
in that lemon you don't want to cook

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,199
them you cook them you change it

406
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,079
is what you do

407
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,480
you change it if you cook them

408
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:51,120
they don't flush

409
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,000
it becomes something different

410
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,600
so that's important to know right

411
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,480
so

412
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
um

413
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,920
if you're sensitive if you got teeth

414
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,199
that are sensitive

415
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,920
can't handle cold water on your teeth

416
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,839
right then do lukewarm warm temp like

417
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,279
you don't like room temp or anything

418
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,600
like that okay

419
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
if you get sensitive teeth from lemon

420
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
water

421
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
from you think the lemon if the lemon

422
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,600
that's not the lemon giving you

423
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,839
sensitive teeth that just means you have

424
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,480
sensitive nerves

425
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,240
that means you have sensitive nerves

426
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,320
so keep that in mind

427
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,920
the calcium in lemon restores the teeth

428
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,000
is what it does it restores enamel

429
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
you know that's what it does

430
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,880
like

431
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,040
lemon will showcase you have a problem

432
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,360
but it doesn't create a problem that's

433
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,320
important to know so lemon does not

434
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,000
create a problem

435
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
it just showcases that you have

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,600
sensitivities you have inflammation in

437
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,399
your jaw inflammation in your teeth

438
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,480
inflammation in your gums

439
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,240
right that's what it could do but lemon

440
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,120
itself kills pathogens in the mouth

441
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,920
and around the gum line

442
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
keeping you from getting cavities

443
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,800
keeping you from these kinds of things

444
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,839
so that's that's what happens there so

445
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,639
i'm just letting you know okay

446
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,560
so lemon water is the first thing

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,000
right we're going into

448
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
and then we'll do before we go into

449
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
anything else we're going to talk about

450
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,480
other stuff right here

451
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,680
so when it comes down to symptoms a lot

452
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,680
of people have anxiety they have panic

453
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,600
they have heart palpitations they have

454
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
racing heart

455
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
a lot of people are struggling

456
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,600
struggling with all of that a lot of

457
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,880
people have that diagnosis of bipolar a

458
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,360
lot of people

459
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,279
are up and down that's what the bipolar

460
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,959
diagnosis means it doesn't give you a

461
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,720
real answer it just says well that

462
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,560
person's always either manic or that

463
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
person's just depressed

464
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
so eventually they get it they get a

465
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
bipolar diagnosis

466
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,600
power of compassion says when i started

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,040
medical medium i used to have very

468
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
sensitive teeth

469
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,639
after drinking lemon water now i don't

470
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,959
feel anything i love lemon water power

471
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,559
compassion because you're because you're

472
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,000
doing medical medium

473
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,600
and medical being protocols you're

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
restoring your nerves

475
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,480
you're strengthening your nerves

476
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
that's why so you're strengthening your

477
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
central nervous system so everything

478
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
strengthens your entire

479
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
central nervous system that's what's

480
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,760
incredible about that

481
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,520
sandy says celery juice it helped

482
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
restore my gums

483
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,559
it does despite what people who don't

484
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,240
drink celery juice say they don't drink

485
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,440
it out there they just they're naysayers

486
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,440
because they want to just destroy

487
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,960
anybody's chance of healing

488
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
so they'll say hey

489
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
you know don't drink celery juice i

490
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
heard it's bad for you it's like okay

491
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
that's great you just ruined a chance

492
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
for somebody to heal their gums like

493
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,360
sandy so thank god you you're actually

494
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,440
you're listening you're drinking your

495
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,720
celery juice you heal your gums that

496
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,600
that's amazing that's incredible

497
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,919
so our central nervous system can get

498
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,679
inflamed easy

499
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,120
pathogens inflame our central nervous

500
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,840
system metals have a big role in it too

501
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,360
but metals do other things too metals

502
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,720
get into

503
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
the brain

504
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,919
is what they do

505
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,360
eventually a lot of people though

506
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,960
they'll like bang their head in their

507
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,080
car door

508
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
they go

509
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,120
to the hospital

510
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
they get an mri on their head

511
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,280
to make sure they're okay

512
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,559
and then the doctor says i see something

513
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
on there

514
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,080
but we don't know what it is but we see

515
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,840
something we see gray area we see

516
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,840
a dark spot we see something there

517
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,360
people don't realize

518
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,240
okay that

519
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,600
a lot of times toxic heavy metals create

520
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,000
these oxidative places in the brain like

521
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,360
dark spots little different spots in our

522
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
brain

523
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,919
okay so we get these marks inside our

524
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,760
brain so there's millions of people

525
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,760
around the world that eventually when

526
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,080
they get an mri they have these little

527
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
you have these little dots that show up

528
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
a lot of times it won't even show up but

529
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,080
they'll have these dots that show up

530
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,400
right they'll show up somewhere in the

531
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,679
brain anywhere little black spots and

532
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
stuff like that

533
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,280
so metals tend to hide in a lot of

534
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,039
places right

535
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
adhd

536
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,320
autism

537
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
metals go right here i'll show you on a

538
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,440
close-up on that right there metals go

539
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,160
right here midline canal right there

540
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
so adhd autism

541
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,600
right there it is

542
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
right in between the left and right

543
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,760
hemisphere

544
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,559
on tic toc you guys i we're doing a

545
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,120
camera close up over here so i know you

546
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,880
guys can't see it but that midline canal

547
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,520
right here

548
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,200
that's where the metal settle

549
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,440
when you're a child

550
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,039
they settle in the midline canal

551
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,799
so

552
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,240
so when when um

553
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,720
moms and dads are giving their children

554
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,720
the heavy metal detox smoothie they're

555
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,120
seeing progress

556
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,159
because the heavy metal detox smoothie

557
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,000
is removing metals out of the midline

558
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,320
canal

559
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
and so progress is occurring

560
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,880
because we're getting metals so with

561
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,240
autism and adhd the metals that gather

562
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,320
in the midline canal right here

563
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,039
they interfere with information

564
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,120
traveling back and forth from the left

565
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,440
and right hemisphere i wrote about that

566
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,080
in the medical medium books

567
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
so there's information that travels back

568
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
and forth

569
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,360
and when that canal is filled up with

570
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,360
metal right here so the information goes

571
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,039
back and forth to left and right

572
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,240
hemisphere

573
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,600
so

574
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,880
when that is filled up with mercury

575
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,919
when that's filled up with aluminum

576
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,840
information doesn't travel across easily

577
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,919
and so you end up with the autism

578
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,720
diagnosis you end up with all the

579
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,200
symptoms you end up with the severe adhd

580
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
that's the metals in the midline canal

581
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,919
okay

582
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
now here's the thing a lot of people

583
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,280
have metals

584
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,280
sprinkled about

585
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,840
and that ends it ends up adding up as

586
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,400
the years go on and we get the brain fog

587
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,240
so how many people have brain fog

588
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,000
or how many people had brain fog i know

589
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
a lot of people using medical medium

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
information

591
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,720
and and brain fog proto uh protocols for

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
brain fog they actually fix it

593
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,559
right

594
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,720
so miriam says my teeth bled in every

595
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,880
pregnancy but not this one means you're

596
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,960
getting stronger getting healthier

597
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
incredible

598
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,120
so with brain fog you can have metal

599
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,480
sprinkled about

600
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,159
so you're wondering like where do i get

601
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,840
mercury and all these metals if word is

602
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,679
like where does it where does it come

603
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,320
from well i notice a lot of people like

604
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,720
tattoos these days

605
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,440
a lot of people like ink these days

606
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,400
and i'm not against getting ink at all

607
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,240
if you got ink don't get it removed

608
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,799
you know i mean if you have ink it's

609
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,440
fine that's fine but what people don't

610
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,280
realize is that's a huge one for toxic

611
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,600
heavy metals that's why the heavy metal

612
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,679
detox cleanse is so important

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,000
that's why the heavy metal detox

614
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,120
smoothie is so important because what

615
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
happens is that this tattoo's really

616
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,000
cool too

617
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,080
this tattoo says germany this is really

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
cool

619
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,400
so

620
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,960
you got the skull on there a lot of

621
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,280
people get skulls on their arms

622
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,640
a lot of people get skulls on their arms

623
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,679
i'm going to get a close-up on this

624
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
right

625
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,960
well

626
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,039
a lot of people seem that cool this is

627
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
germany isn't that cool

628
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,760
we got a lot of german uh uh

629
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
uh fans and followers and that do the

630
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,120
medical mean protocols anyway

631
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,880
i thought i'd put this one on for today

632
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,960
a lot of people get roses

633
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,720
right it's like plant a rose garden a

634
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
lot of people get roses

635
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
so there's nothing wrong with getting

636
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
tattoos

637
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
it's just that there's no heavy metal

638
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
free

639
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,799
ink

640
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,640
so when you get when someone's like hey

641
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,559
i know this great tattoo parlor i know

642
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,039
this great tattoo artist

643
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,400
they use cruelty free

644
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,320
ink they use animal cruelty free ink

645
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,480
it's vegan

646
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,039
it's vegan ink

647
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,360
it's filled with metal you can't have it

648
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,520
any other way and i'll tell you why

649
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,360
when you get your ink

650
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,039
right and i'll show you this right here

651
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,360
you see this rose you can see this rose

652
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,400
up close

653
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,559
the reason why you can see the rose on

654
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
your arm when you get the ink or you get

655
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
on your wherever you got your tattoo

656
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,559
maybe you just got an excrep inscription

657
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,159
maybe you just got some wise words

658
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,240
you know like some wise words written

659
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,080
across maybe you got like

660
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,600
you know the name of of something

661
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,120
written somewhere whatever it is that

662
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,320
you choose to get

663
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,440
you see the rose it pops when light hits

664
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
it right

665
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,919
when it's in your arm and the only way

666
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
that can happen is if that ink is filled

667
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,640
with metal

668
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,600
that's the reflective nature of the ink

669
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,000
so what happens is when light goes into

670
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,919
your derma

671
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,240
anything like any kind of light not

672
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,200
sunlight any kind of light goes through

673
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,000
your derma it hits the ink and it

674
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,120
reflects back out

675
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,039
that's how you get that pop

676
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,400
so when you walk out of the tattoo

677
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,360
parlor

678
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,880
and the dude there or whoever gave you a

679
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,000
tattoo

680
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,919
they said it was animal cruelty free ink

681
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,640
maybe it was animal cruelty free free

682
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,320
ink but it's not heavy metal free ink

683
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,480
because the metals

684
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,279
make it so you can see it

685
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,000
and so here's how it works as the metals

686
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,679
go into your bloodstream every day from

687
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,679
there on out

688
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,919
and they go to your brain over time as

689
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,880
the metals travel into your bloodstream

690
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,679
and get to your brain over time

691
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
okay

692
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,600
your your tattoo fades it's not fading

693
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,840
because you're getting older

694
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,000
it's not fading because you've had the

695
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,799
tattoo for 10 years or 15 years 20 years

696
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,279
it's fading because all the metal is

697
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,400
slowly leaving through your derma that

698
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,840
pass through your derm into your

699
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,840
bloodstream and ends up in your

700
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,679
liver and ends up in your brain

701
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,600
that's where it's going

702
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,799
right and it's not about getting them

703
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
removed

704
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:26,000
it's about just being proactive and

705
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,640
catching the metals as they're leaving

706
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,600
i always tell people who are inked up

707
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,000
heavy metal detox smoothie for life man

708
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,200
heavy metal detox smoothie for life

709
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,919
because what you're gonna do is you're

710
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,000
gonna be catching the metals as they're

711
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,080
going to the brain you're gonna be

712
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,799
catching them

713
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,960
arena park says mm tools have healed my

714
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
really bad teeth and gum sensitivities i

715
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,679
no longer have nerve pain in my cavity

716
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,360
that's incredible on youtube amazing

717
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
amazing

718
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,000
so what happened the other day i think

719
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
it was not the other day but like a

720
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
month ago or something i mentioned about

721
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,640
tattoos and someone was like i gotta get

722
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,000
them all removed just like no you don't

723
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,559
have to get them all removed you just

724
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,480
gotta be proactive and catch the metal

725
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,840
as it's going into the

726
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,080
stream they're like okay i'm gonna get

727
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,559
more tattoos then now i'm gonna get more

728
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,480
tattoos you don't have to do that either

729
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,000
you don't have to get more tattoos i

730
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,039
know it's addictive but you don't have

731
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,039
to get more more tattoos right

732
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,480
but the point is the bottom line is i'm

733
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,799
just saying you guys

734
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,120
that if anybody has any ink

735
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,640
that metal and some ink is way worse

736
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,799
than others for sure but either way

737
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,840
they're all packed with metal that's how

738
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
you see

739
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
the

740
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,279
picture

741
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,360
you see the picture because you're

742
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,320
watching light

743
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,240
hit the metal and reflect back out

744
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,720
through your skin

745
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,400
that's how you see the picture that's

746
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,279
how it's done

747
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,200
lots of metals so the bottom line is

748
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,520
where do we get metals

749
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,480

little bit a lot of people come to

790
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,720
medical medium information brand new off

791
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
the press and their teeth are about to

792
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,360
fall apart

793
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,320
their teeth are about to fall apart

794
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,960
they're coming into

795
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,880
the medical meeting community

796
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,000
they get a book

797
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,399
they're starting their first process

798
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,720
but their teeth are time capsules that

799
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,880
are about to all fall apart

800
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,640
you know what i'm saying you guys

801
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,080
they've already screwed up throughout

802
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,520
their life

803
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
it's not their fault they just didn't

804
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,679
know they already did too much caffeine

805
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,360
for too many years which

806
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,880
eats your teeth from the inside out

807
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
and i'm not picking on anybody drink

808
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,520
caffeine or whatever i'm not that's not

809
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
where we're going today but i'm saying

810
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,399
they already did vinegar years of

811
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,559
vinegar

812
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,440
they've already done years of vinegar

813
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,799
okay

814
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
for years

815
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,559
okay they've already done lots of dairy

816
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
products

817
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,080
they've already

818
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,679
created an acidic environment in their

819
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
life

820
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,240
they've already done these things right

821
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,279
they've already eaten all this msg and

822
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,520
nutritional yeast and everything else

823
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,919
they've they've already done all this

824
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,640
charcoal and made themselves deficient

825
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,799
because charcoal actually clogs up your

826
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
highways and your intestinal tract so

827
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,559
that you don't get any nutrients so you

828
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,159
essentially get nutrient deficient when

829
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,480
you eat charcoal

830
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,399
right they did all these things and then

831
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,200
they come into the medical medium

832
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,679
community with time capsules that are

833
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,360
about to freaking explode

834
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,559
they're about to need a lot of dental

835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,000
work in a year or six months

836
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,360
they come into the medical medium

837
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,159
community

838
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,000
literally like time capsules of all the

839
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
crap they did before

840
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,120
they come in

841
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:05,520
and their teeth start falling apart

842
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:08,000
and they're like ever since ever since

843
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,240
i did the medical medium lemon water my

844
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,159
teeth are all falling apart ever since i

845
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,399
did the medical medium celery juice my

846
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,080
teeth are falling apart i started eating

847
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,320
celery sticks for the first time in my

848
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,159
life and my teeth started falling apart

849
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,799
i did the spiruline and my teeth are

850
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
falling apart i did his orange just eat

851
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,720
one orange and eat three apples a day

852
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,720
and my teeth are falling apart and they

853
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,080
just all of a sudden now they have no

854
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,320
idea that they came in here

855
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,880
with time capsules and they just started

856
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,880
falling apart cold white spring may

857
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,720
what's going on mine fell apart before i

858
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
found medical medium

859
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
how lucky is medical medium that they

860
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,039
fell apart before instead of during like

861
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,120
right when you got here like in your may

862
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,799
may have you got here and you started

863
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,399
doing everything

864
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,559
then they started falling apart you

865
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,320
might be like that anthony you might not

866
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,760
like me anymore but i don't know may you

867
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,840
you know a lot of stuff so you probably

868
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,760
would never be like that i know that

869
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,000
about you you're awesome but

870
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,000
and so the thing is is that it all

871
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,159
depends when you're arriving into the

872
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,799
medical meeting community

873
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,159
that determines what's going to happen

874
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,600
with your teeth

875
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,519
you can come into the medical meeting

876
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,519
community and do stuff and your teeth

877
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,399
can still fall apart because it was

878
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,640
years and years of bad stuff you got to

879
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,279
hang in there to keep them from falling

880
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,159
apart and and even get them better

881
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,320
right

882
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,559
what happens is the reason why teeth are

883
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,840
depleting out there is because

884
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,760
everybody's losing the insides of their

885
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,840
teeth and their enamel because they're

886
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,440
doing all the wrong stuff they're

887
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,200
drinking their coffee they're drinking

888
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,039
their espressos their green tea their

889
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
matcha tea they're doing their kombucha

890
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,760
tea

891
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
it's not that i have all this stuff

892
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,120
against kombucha tea where i hate

893
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,880
kombucha tea or something so bad the

894
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,880
problem is it's got caffeine in it it's

895
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
also extremely acidic and it kills your

896
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,480
teeth you've got all these yoga mamas

897
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,720
out there and yoga papas that they're

898
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,240
all into yoga studios and they're all

899
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,159
doing their yoga they're drinking their

900
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,399
kombucha tea and they're just they're

901
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,159
about to kill their teeth give it just

902
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,120
five more years get them out of their

903
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
early 30s get them into their late 30s

904
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,240
and all their teeth are going to need

905
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,399
work and start falling apart because of

906
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,320
their kombucha tea

907
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,919
but every now and then someone will be

908
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,200
in their late 30s about to lose all

909
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,480
their teeth and they come into the

910
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,000
medical meeting community because they

911
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
got brain fog and all of a sudden their

912
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,519
teeth start falling apart and they're

913
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,600
like oh my god it's the medical media

914
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,240
these time capsules

915
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,399
they rot from the inside out and they

916
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,880
just start crumbling and that's what

917
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,360
happened sun moon love says lost all my

918
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,840
teeth before finding medical medium so

919
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,000
it all depends on where you land how you

920
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,640
come into the medical medium community

921
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,720
if you come in and the timing is just

922
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,559
right with your teeth you already

923
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,799
destroyed your teeth and didn't know it

924
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,159
for two decades and you came into the

925
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,960
medical media community and now they

926
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,760
start falling apart

927
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,840
that's the confusion

928
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,080
marisa spiritual says my teeth on

929
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,080
youtube my teeth all all fell apart

930
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,240
before medical medium but after starting

931
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,480
medical medium protocols i have healed a

932
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,960
dark spot on my tooth i had for years

933
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,880
it's a power of spirit of compassion's

934
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,679

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,319
so we're making some celery juice right

1131
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,319
now 16 to 32 ounces of celery juice

1132
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,000
you want to strain your celery juice i

1133
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,359
always say that no matter what kind of

1134
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,800
juicer you have you want to strain it

1135
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,790
let's try to make some room back here

1136
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,889
so you want to strain it

1137
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,889
[Music]

1138
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,880
that's the key

1139
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,680
so

1140
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,960
there we go

1141
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,599
after all these years

1142
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,480
all right you got 16 and 32 ounces of

1143
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,480
celery juice right there

1144
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,920
okay

1145
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,520
wondering about the blender

1146
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,880
you can make celery juice with a blender

1147
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,160
if you want if you don't have a juicer

1148
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,599
make it make it with a blender but you

1149
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,760
got to squeeze it through a cheesecloth

1150
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,079
or a nut milk bag

1151
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
and that's okay if a blender's all you

1152
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,280
got throw celery in the blender but

1153
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,839
don't add water

1154
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,800
don't add water so if you do the celery

1155
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,480
juice in your blender don't add water

1156
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
you still got to strain it squeeze it

1157
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,400
through a nut milk bag you don't want a

1158
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,640
celery smoothie it's not going to work

1159
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,400

1160
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,760

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,960
i used to promote other spirulina

1301
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,280
companies in the past

1302
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,040
okay i don't anymore

1303
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,640
because this stuff doesn't compare to

1304
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,359
this one

1305
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,640
right doesn't compare to this one so i'm

1306
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,480
just going to tell you right now and

1307
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,599
but this is the best best one on the

1308
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,839
market

1309
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,440
the ones the ones i used to support in

1310
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,119
the past

1311
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,720
their quality

1312
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,880
doesn't touch this but it's not just

1313
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,680
that one of the companies i used to

1314
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,599
recommend all the time in the past

1315
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,040
something went down

1316
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,720
in in their product and they never

1317
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,319
wanted to talk to me about it and ever

1318
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,680
since then i would never even recommend

1319
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,760
them

1320
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,599
chris has said i was using vimergy

1321
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,680
products in my heavy metal detox

1322
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,640
smoothie and saw incredible results in

1323
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,720
such a short period of time when i ran

1324
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,240
out of energy i had to go to cheap

1325
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,920
brands and the rate of healing is

1326
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:17,200
significant uh significantly slower and

1327
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,520
and that's on facebook charissa chrisa

1328
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,720
i i have heard that and watched that

1329
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,760
over the years it see what people say is

1330
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,359
you always recommend vimera gaw

1331
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,440
i get you're not sponsored but you

1332
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,599
always recommend vimergy give the other

1333
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,000
supplement companies a chance

1334
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,800
but what happened was vimergy made the

1335
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,119
product so good all the products

1336
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,760
that what happened was people healed

1337
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,480
faster

1338
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,280
and

1339
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,160
like healed faster but not just healed

1340
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,160
faster healed things that i didn't see

1341
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,400
heal with the other products so it's

1342
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,319
like it's like so what do you do you

1343
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,280
give the other supplement companies that

1344
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,359
are lower quality a chance

1345
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,559
or do you promote

1346
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,960
something

1347
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,440
and recommend something that you know

1348
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,440
heals somebody faster that's the

1349
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,680
predicament i got in

1350
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,720
it's like so you see me always like it's

1351
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,680
always like vim rajiv energy

1352
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,280
but if it if you heal faster from what

1353
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,200
i've seen from what you said and from

1354
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,040
what i've seen everywhere including

1355
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,480
family and friends

1356
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,559
that i know

1357
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,559
and they heal quicker

1358
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,359
and then they when they don't use energy

1359
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,040
they don't heal as fast or heal at all

1360
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,440
and when i see that it's like what do

1361
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,520
you do you have to just be like you know

1362
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,440
what you work for the light

1363
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,520
hands down you just have to let people

1364
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,760
know what's the best stuff

1365
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,200
so anyway

1366
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:48,640
that's the spirulina right there

1367
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,280
i mean for neurological problems

1368
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,960
that's a that's a huge one right there

1369
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,960
for for helping people neurological

1370
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,200
problems catherine elizabeth love wild

1371
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,680

1377
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,559

1381
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,240

1382
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,119
i just took a swig off the bottle hope

1383
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,119
you guys don't mind

1384
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,960
ryan what's your thoughts on using the

1385
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,480
metal spoon on a scoop

1386
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,119
okay

1387
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,119
good question

1388
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,280
that's a metal strainer

1389
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,319
okay

1390
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,319
that's a metal knife

1391
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,119
i don't have to worry

1392
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:55,000
because whatever steel

1393
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,000
comes off of these babies

1394
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:00,319
i'm crushing

1395
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,040
i'm crushing

1396
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,880
that's that's how it works

1397
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,800
okay

1398
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,520
will i

1399
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,319
jump into a pile of mercury molted

1400
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,319
mercury no

1401
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,079
will i go get a fluoride treatment no

1402
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,280
no

1403
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:24,000
because i'll still need this to get the

1404
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,960
fluoride out and anything else

1405
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,400
right

1406
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:31,359
you still have to live on planet earth

1407
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,160
you still have to live on planet earth

1408
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,880
and if you want to go to my amazon live

1409
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,839
shows afterwards

1410
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,760

1411
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,960
if you want to go to my amazon live

shows if you check out my amazon live um

1413
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,440
platform right

1414
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,280

1418
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,440
but i'm not afraid of a metal spoon

1419
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:03,119
because i'm crushing it this will grab

1420
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,680
whatever came off of this times 10

1421
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,119
times 10. this will go

1422
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,680
to the brain

1423
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,880
and grab stuff deep from out of the

1424
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
brain

1425
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,880
never mind whatever's happening with the

1426
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,119
