we're dealing with something and it's in

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,120
the way and it's hard it's hard because

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,680
you the world is hard enough to live in

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,479
it's hard enough to live in it really is

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,479
and um for all walks of life for all

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,280
walks of life for sure I mean for

25
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,240
different reasons for some for different

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,799
reasons for others but it's it it's a

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,680
difficult place it's not a it's not such

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,000
a easy easy place that's why we always

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
that's why we always when we raise our

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,880
children we protect them and we we look

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,640
after them because we know we know the

32
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,159
world is a scary plays and as our

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,079
children grow up we're like we're

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,240
nervous we're nervous we're nervous when

35
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,159
they go off to college we're nervous

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,680
when they enter High School we're

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,399
nervous um you know when they meet

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,560
people we're nervous and there's reasons

39
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,560
why we're

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,960
nervous because let's face it okay yeah

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
the world is hard and we want every

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,719
opportunity we can and best best and

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,439
safest and and um and opportunity for

44
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,439
our children just like just just like we

45
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,320
would want for even ourselves as adults

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,119
and and just because the world is always

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,599
a difficult place in so many ways so

48
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,720
when we're sick we don't feel good we

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,360
have symptoms that we have symptoms that

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,560
that even though they have names to them

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,680
and some don't have names to them CU you

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,599
know in in chronic illness it's just

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,560
it's it's not cracked up to where it's

54
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,319
supposed to be it's not it's not up to

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,840
that point and um but if we have

56
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,760
symptoms whether they're named or not it

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,760
gets difficult and because most all

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,360
symptoms most almost all symptoms are

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,080
mystery they're mystery and that's why

60
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,800
that's why we need hey look and who has

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,280
10 years or 20 years to wait for an

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,000
answer on a symptom we got to do our

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,959
best now and we have to do what we can

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,680
now that's what the show is about

65
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
because this is the only Health show

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,360
where the information here it doesn't

67
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,120
come from contaminated sources it

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,840
doesn't come from sources like interest

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,920
groups and medical funding with strings

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,000
attached to it The Botch research I talk

71
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,239
about all the time the lobbyists in the

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,879
medical field the internal Kickbacks the

73
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,760
thumb on the scale and all kinds of

74
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,959
science and research so it pushes it one

75
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,080
way for reasons to F because of funding

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,400
persuaded belief systems that that get

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,360
so saturated they take over and they

78
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,360
don't let any new ideas come in to

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,080
private panels of

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,120
influencers that have to go a certain

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,799
way and vote a certain way on the

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,879
medical field both alternative and

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,480
conventional because of money involved

84
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,040
to health field payoffs to trendy traps

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,080
can you believe that stuff's in the way

86
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,840
of getting us better I mean it just

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,280
blows my mind it blows my mind and

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,720
you're not going to get any of that here

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
the information here is pure it's clean

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,920
it's untampered with it comes from a

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,799
source I was born to here at age four I

92
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,959
received a a a voice that was speaking

93
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,560
to me perfectly clear I dedicate it my

94
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,480
entire life because cuz I had no choice

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,159
I dedicated my entire life with working

96
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,720
with that voice and making sure the

97
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,799
information and the and and what we need

98
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,079
to heal and move forward is clean it's

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,079
pure untampered with and doesn't have

100
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,680
all that stuff I just mentioned and

101
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,479
that's what the shows about so it's the

102
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,919
only Health show that has that because

103
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,680
even information that's swimming out

104
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,960
there on the Internet or anywhere else

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,639
could have contamination to it in one

106
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,759
way or another even if there's jewels

107
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,039
and gems to pick from it that are pretty

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
good there's also some traps in there we

109
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,199
don't want that we don't want that so

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,320
that's what this is about

111
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,280
today today we're talking about eating

112
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,280
disorders and and this is a serious

113
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,960
serious thing we're going to cover the

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,840
serious eating disorder aspects that

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,880
that we know about but we're going to

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,280
cover also the other ones that aren't

117
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,120
serious but they're annoying and and

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,919
there's a lot of things involved with

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,520
eating disorders there's a lot more than

120
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,680
I think people

121
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,800
no and you know and when it comes down

122
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,360
to eating

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,960
disorders okay there's a lot of messed

124
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,600
up stuff going on I'm not talking about

125
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
the people suffering with the eating

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,400
disorder I'm talking about the way it's

127
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,280
viewed and understood in medical science

128
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,400
and research talking about contaminated

129
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,680
sources of information talking about you

130
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,400
know skewed funding and everything else

131
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,160
and all that stuff I talked the know

132
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,240
panels of influencers when it comes down

133
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,639
to eating disorders it's in a way that's

134
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,319
really not that helpful of course we

135
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,039
have emergency medicine for people who

136
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,080
have severe severe eating disorders and

137
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,080
and and you know

138
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,360
and emergency strategies that are

139
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,039
involved that are out there that have

140
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,440
saved lives and I'm not denouncing that

141
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,800
but at the same time there's really not

142
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,600
a lot of helpful stuff going on out

143
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,039
there in the medical world for people

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,880
with serious serious serious Eating

145
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:03,360
Disorders it's just it's not there it's

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,160
not there sure if they took a few

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
billion dollars or2 billion and they put

148
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,160
it just to eating disorders it would be

149
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,759
amazing and they and they opened up the

150
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,280
you know and they freed they freed

151
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,960
everything so it wasn't just so just

152
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,000
trapped with you know problems in the

153
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,840
industry if they freed it to open to

154
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,759
ideas and let really wonderful people in

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,560
medicine say what they need to say and

156
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:32,039
help people way they need to help we can

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,520
move forward but it's like that with a

158
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,880
lot of diseases and illnesses and things

159
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,319
we struggle with but with eating

160
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,440
disorders it's really it's really sad

161
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,720
because it's it's really a place that's

162
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,160
not tapped into it's a place that's not

163
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,800
tapped into at

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,840
all it's really and in fact they try to

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,080
it's like black and white they try to

blow your mind information that nobody

210
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,039
knows in the cancer

211
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,640

212
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,880
it's really exciting that's something

213
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,160

numbers seem to come out right or

228
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,360
something seems to come up like Auto

229
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,040

straight they come the Eating Disorders

257
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,079
range from being

258
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,880
brainwashed

259
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,839
brainwashed on how to eat originally

260
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,079
from the 1920s 1930s from the 1930s

261
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,240
actually

262
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:55,480
1933 1933 when the schulls were invaded

263
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,040
with how you need to eat and that was

264
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,120
taking away healthy diets from families

265
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,560
that knew had that that had a lineage to

266
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,680
knowing how to feed their children and

267
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,320
feed their husbands and feed their

268
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,560
family and feed feed their loved ones

269
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,240
and that was Stripped Away by

270
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,560
1933 because this new doctrine came in

271
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,360
this law came in about about how you

272
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,839
should eat about how much protein you

273
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,519
need and how many vegetables you don't

274
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,519
need and how many fruits you don't need

275
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,800
and it's all about protein and protein

276
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,040
became cheap cuz the industry exploded

277
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,240
right before World War II so animal

278
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,399
protein became really really cheap and

279
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,399
was became affordable purposely

280
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,480
purposely at this time I'm not saying

281
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,079
all this cuz I'm anti-animal protein if

282
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,040
you like it fine I'm just telling you

283
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,240
how it

284
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:47,200
went and healthy diets that predate 1933

285
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,320
where families raised their children

286
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,240
on out of the gardens and so forth were

287
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,120
starting to be like thrown on the back

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,839
burner and in the school system it was

289
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,760
inocent it was was right there in the

290
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,240
school system the law became here is

291
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,399
what here's what you need vegetables are

292
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,000
down here that's that's the lowest

293
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,800
amount you need that's the smallest

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,360
amount of things you need and what's at

295
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,240
the top of the the top here you you got

296
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,120
to have lots and lots of protein that's

297
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,839
at the very top and the protein has to

298
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,760
be animals so it can't be nuts and seeds

299
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,760
and it can't be leafy greens and it

300
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,519
can't be those things at all it has to

301
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,199
be the animal products this is when the

302
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,760
animal world made made a deal with the

303
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:36,480
government with the school systems and

304
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
they all kind of got together and a deal

305
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,920
was made in

306
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,720
1933 that alone created Eating Disorders

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,160
eating disorders that you think are

308
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,880
healthy but we're following the rules of

309
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,360
the government on how to eat in 1933

310
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,160
which still sticks to us from our

311
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,320
grandparents to our parents and so forth

312
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,320
to us and in some way we still have a

313
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,240
fabric of a little bit of the the eating

314
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,000
disorder that was given to us that was

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,399
manufactured and given to us how do you

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,800
like them apples huh how do you like

317
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,240

little piece of eating disorder

319
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,839
information that you'll never hear

320
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,800
anywhere else but here that's just one

321
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,320

adults that have to drink every night

365
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:56,880
and have a glass of wine that's an

366
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,240
eating disorder it's not just about

367
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,160
alcoholism or anything like that it's

368
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,160
not about that it's not even about that

369
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,480
so

370
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,800
much alcoholism of eating

371
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,880
disorder it's an eating

372
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,920
disorder that's right have I said that's

373
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,279
right enough lately I don't think so

374
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,399
that's right that you know it just

375
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,680
alcohol alone isn't you know that having

376
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,600
to be in the diet on a regular basis in

377
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,160
someone's life on a regular

378
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,079
basis isn't there's any heating disorder

379
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,519
there would you believe it and then

380
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,720
there's emotional Eating Disorders on

381
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,920
all kinds of level there's OCD Eating

382
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,839
Disorders yes everything's got to be

383
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,600
perfect in regiment it down to the bone

384
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,160
without a health problem I mean without

385
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,839
no health problems that are there that

386
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
are present what I'm trying to say is

387
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,440
that there's people that are dealing

388
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,040
with health problems and health issues

389
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,360
they have to eat regimented because they

390
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,759
got to keep their adrenal strong they

391
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,440
got to keep their electrolytes going

392
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,199
they have to keep the nerves transmitter

393
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,279
because they got underlying conditions

394
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,279
did I say that fast enough dear dear

395
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,399
Lord

396
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:07,040
um you know basically what this means is

397
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,160
that people with health conditions yeah

398
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,920
they have to eat every two hours I talk

399
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,279
about that all the time Spirit has

400
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,600
taught me that every hour and a half

401
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,279
depending on what kind of adrenal

402
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,759
problem somebody has depending on a

403
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,160
liver problem all these different

404
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,120
things and that that's even difficult

405
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,959
enough and that can create different

406
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,839
kinds of eating disorders for different

407
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,519
reasons but we do the best we can but

408
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:34,120
what really creates eating disord

409
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:37,360
orders really creates them is this

410
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,120
notion this notion that we need three

411
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
meals a day and three meals a day only

412
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,000
that creates them because then if

413
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,240
someone has a health problem and they

414
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,680
have to eat every hour and a half and

415
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,959
they have to munch on celery sticks and

416
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,639
a handful of nuts and some apple slices

417
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,920
someone's going to call them call them

418
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
out and say hey you got an eaing

419
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,560
disorder if you have to eat every hour

420
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
and a half and you have to eat an apple

421
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,880
and and and celery sure we could say

422
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,600
that but really what that's doing is

423
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,959
saving somebody's adrenals and saving

424
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,640
their health and rebuilding them and

425
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,439
recovering them but someone who

426
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,120
regimentally regimented has to eat three

427
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,120
meals a day and believes anybody else

428
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,199
who eats different has a has a problem

429
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,959
that's an eating disorder that's one

430
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,120
right

431
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,199
there that right there that becomes an

432
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,839
OCD variety of eating

433
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,559
disorder also you know so here's the

434
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,000
thing that's how confusing it all is see

435
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,039
what I'm trying to say is if someone's

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,280
actually doing a protocol that's

437
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,480
regimented the proper kind of protocol

438
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,559
that's there to rebuild their health and

439
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,880
heal it's needed and you have to do it

440
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,919
even if that's someone when they don't

441
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,360
need that anymore it's hard to break and

442
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,160
that's what I meant by it being possibly

443
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,600
an eating disorder maybe 2 years is what

444
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
you needed to rebuild your adrenals 2

445
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,200
and A2 years is what you needed to build

446
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
your rebuild your adrenals but now you

447
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,919
know you're afraid to leave that one

448
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,159
hour to an hour and a half of of of of

449
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,280
grazing and you're afraid to to go 2 and

450
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,760
1/2 hours that day or 3 hours and you

451
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,360
get nervous and that's when it can

452
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
become like that but that but that was

453
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,440
to rebuild your adrenals that was to

454
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
rebuild you that was to heal you and

455
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,960
that's no problem because you can get

456
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,000
past that but it's hard to get past it's

457
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,159
hard to get past so many other traps

458
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,440
that are out the real traps traps in the

459
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,880
industry like I just said that date back

460
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,280
all the way to

461
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,320
1933 and those are

462
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,320
serious and those are really serious

463
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
and then you got of course you got the

464
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,840
when it comes down to emotional eading

465
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,640
emotional eading that means you know you

466
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,159
got stress it's one way of coping with

467
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,000
stress but I'm going to talk about that

468
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,280
let's talk about that now why does

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,440
somebody emotionally eat they

470
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,000
emotionally eat and I'm going to tell

471
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,120
you right now what it

472
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,840
is not because they're missing something

473
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,600
necessarily meaning they're missing

474
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,520
something in their life whether it's

475
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,400
love life or anything

476
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:03,280
else that's not really totally the

477
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,799
answer they're emotionally eating

478
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,840
because they're trying to get enough

479
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,480
glucose to the brain it's so critical

480
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,159
and to the liver they're getting to try

481
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,320
to get to to uh compensate for any kind

482
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,440
of stress that they're under some people

483
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,200
have they have glycogen storages that

484
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,039
are really down low in the brain because

485
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,559
the brain is made out of glycogen which

486
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,120
is a

487
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:26,880
carbohydrate and I swear to God if some

488
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,960
says the brain is made out of fat one

489
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,559
more time I'm meaning in the health

490
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,200
field a professional and expert says the

491
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,240
brain is made out of fat one more time I

492
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know what to say anymore because

493
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm going to tell you right now it's not

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,360
made out of fat there are traces traces

495
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,480
of squalling traces of of of Omega-3s

496
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
traces in the

497
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,679
brain I

498
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,679
repeat traces do you know what traces

499
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:05,039
means traces mean

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:08,679
minuscule very small amounts tiny levels

501
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:13,200
of fat in the brain the brain is

502
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:16,120
made out of cells and glycogen

503
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,000
carbohydrate stored that's why the brain

504
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,640
atrophies when you don't use

505
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,799
it it

506
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:28,240
atrophies it's made out of carbohydrate

507
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,000
the brain thrives on sugar and it stores

508
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,640
an abundance of glycogen because what

509
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,039
runs the brain is that glycogen is that

510
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,679
carbohydrate that's how literally how

511
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:45,200
how messages get through the

512
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,480
brain that's how it gets through the

513
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,440
brain it's really important to

514
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,400
understand this it is because people

515
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
lose all their glycogen in the brain

516
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
when they're under stress they start

517
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,679
losing their glycogen they start losing

518
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,200
their glucose and they start needing

519
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:03,000
bagels and they need donuts and the

520
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,520
emotional eat they're under stress

521
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,720
they're under stress for one minute and

522
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,799
they're gobbling down anything they're

523
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,760
gobbling down something Pizza they're

524
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,559
gobbling down anything they can find

525
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,240
chocolate whatever they can find and

526
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,480
they a lot of times people gobble down

527
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,640
all the wrong stuff when they're under

528
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,960
that kind of stress which makes you

529
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,400
gobble down more because it can it it

530
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,039
can get in the way of sugar and glycogen

531
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,240
getting to the brain it could get in the

532
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,760
way of that getting to the brain and

533
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,720
then if you have a body image if someone

534
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,400
is a body image and they think they got

535
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
to be really skinny and they think

536
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,360
they're

537
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,640
overweight and and and they're starving

538
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,880
themselves of carbohydrate and then it

539
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,000
making them binge later that that's

540
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,279
that's a whole recipe for a

541
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,760
disaster but on the emotional end of

542
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,279
eating the emotional scale of eating I

543
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,720
mean it ranges from all kinds of

544
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,840
different levels

545
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,200
everywhere I mean you go under stress

546
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,640
you need to eat

547
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,279
something and I'm not talking about when

548
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,000

553
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,480
talking about that that might not you

554
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,440
might not eat it all when that happens

555
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,039
for for a month you might starve

556
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,640
yourself I've seen that happen all the

557
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,880
time where you don't eat

558
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,279
anything because you're too sick you're

559
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,799
too sick from the trauma to even eat

560
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,159
anything but then later on after that

561
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,039
once you start recovering from that

562
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,080
trauma you might start eating eating

563
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,320
eating eating because your brain is like

564
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,240
oh my God I lost all that glycogen from

565
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,000

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,000
over over the years my God now hearing

576
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,480
spirit and helping people out in the way

577
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
I've had to help out people and all the

578
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,880
offices that I've had over the years and

579
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,159
helping people out and as much as I did

580
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,039

now I'm going to eat

584
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,559
it my brain needs that fuel I'm going to

585
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,440
eat it oh it's not a good choice though

586
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,400
I get it I I know I didn't pick a good

587
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,400
choice I C came to uh to a bad choice of

588
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,720
food a circum to was bad choice of food

589
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,919
look look the deal is that everybody's

590
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,200
got a eating disorder I have to be

591
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,840
honest I have to be straight if you

592
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,679
think you got it all sewed up and you

593
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,200
think you got it all down you think you

594
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,320
got it down

595
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,640
perfect uh it's possible you don't and

596
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,400
that's okay there's nothing wrong with

597
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,000
that I think we're too hard on people

598
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,360
that are bulimic and anorexic we're too

599
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,159
hard on people way too hard hard we make

600
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,520
it like the whole world has it sewed up

601
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,159
except for them I mean come on that

602
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,360
that's ridiculous and also terrible

603
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,240
terrible because that's what happens

604
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,200
that's what

605
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,640
happens because you know women and men

606
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,760
mostly women okay that have the anorexia

607
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,120
that have the

608
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,520
bulimia all right they feel like it's

609
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,399
just them just them only and I feel like

610
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,440
everybody's eating perfectly whatever

611
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,480
that may be

612
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,000
and that they're they're screwing up

613
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,080
it's disastrous it's not true it's not

614
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,640
true there's so many different eating

615
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,600
disorders in so many different levels

616
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,480
and ways I can't even cover it in a show

617
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,240
there's no way it's not even possible

618
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,240
I'm going to try to cover what I can

619
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,039
just the OCD variety of eating is

620
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,080
unbelievable what people want what they

621
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,520
do of what they like of what they're

622
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,559
what they pet or what they like or what

623
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,600
they're afraid

624
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:58,279
of afraid of trying something new having

625
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,279
that tuna fish sandwich every single

626
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,919
lunch every single lunch for 30 years

627
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,399
that's an eating

628
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,559
disorder 40 years having that tuna for

629
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:12,159
lunch every single day every other day

630
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,520
for lunch and then grill cheese on you

631
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,360
know maybe a couple days a week and

632
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,200
that's it and that's their lunch and

633
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,640
it's regimented and has to be that that

634
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,440
way for 40 years that's an eating

635
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,640
disorder I'm tell you right

636
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,559
now you see what I'm you see where I I'm

637
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,679
I am here with this it's really

638
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,440
difficult

639
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,799
C so it's just to what what degree

640
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,799
somebody has an eating disorder and

641
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,120
what's the underlying cause of one with

642
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,240
bulimia and

643
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,760
anorexia 90% of the

644
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,880
cause is heavy metal toxicity to the

645
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,320
brain mostly Mercury mostly Mercury

646
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,320
inside the brain that came from some

647
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,520
Source from childhood or from pre Source

648
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:01,080
in the womb or from pre Source before

649
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,240
the that from the parents or like I said

650
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,679
from childhood Mercury entered the body

651
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:10,000
somehow some way into a child into a

652
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:16,200
baby that is the future of a possible

653
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:20,559
anorexia or bulimia that's 90% 90% easy

654
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,039
90% or more the other 10% or less

655
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,600
depending on where we are in the world

656
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:28,919
or what where we are but the other 10%

657
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,200
or less is some kind of emotional trauma

658
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,240
some kind of emotional trauma that

659
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,480
happened to the brain that caused

660
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,480
emotional scarring in the brain itself

661
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:43,039
on a physical level not just on a soul

662
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,320
level on a physical level on a physical

663
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,799
level something

664
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,159
happened but that's much less much less

665
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,720
much less on the scale for anorexia and

666
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,960
bulimia than heavy metal poisoning and

667
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,080
here's the problem with the heavy metal

668
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,039
poisoning Professionals in the field of

669
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,840
you know the whole bulimia field of

670
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:05,720
bulimia field of of anorexia those

671
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,640
professionals don't know about the

672
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,279
Mercury have no clue that the Mercury's

673
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,279
causing this on any level or started it

674
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,600
they don't have a clue about that that's

675
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,559
a problem they just think it's all just

676
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,159
emotional all just scarring all just

677
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,480
emotional and they do the best they can

678
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,200
and they help people out the best they

679
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
can I completely understand that and

680
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,240
completely respect that on every

681
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,880
level but

682
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,080
but it's it's the Mercury it's the

683
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,039
Mercury toxicity it's the mercury

684
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,680
poisoning and that's what it is that's a

685
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
big

686
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,480
[Music]

687
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
deal that's a big

688
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:48,000
deal so when it comes down

689
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,480
to when it comes down to Healing bulimia

690
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,279
healing anorexia one thing we have to

691
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,919
understand is that there's an adrenaline

692
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:57,960
Factor I've talked about this before for

693
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,559
instance with bulimia when you vomit it

694
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,159
it forces the adrenals to flood the

695
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,120
whole body with

696
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,799
adrenaline this becomes a

697
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,440
distraction if it's if okay say it's say

698
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,200
you have bulimia because 10% the 10% of

699
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,679
the people have bulimia it's because of

700
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,720
an emotional trauma well by

701
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,440
vomiting the adrenals flood the body

702
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,960
with

703
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,360
adrenaline it becomes

704
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,080
euphoric all that adrenaline hits the

705
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,159
brain and it actually is like heroin

706
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,240
it's it's it's like heroin it's like a

707
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,960
drug and it gets into the brain it

708
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,679
saturates the brain it

709
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,919
completely takes over the

710
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,519
brain and that becomes extremely

711
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,279
addictive so addictive that you get

712
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:49,960
addicted to the adrenaline Factor you're

713
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,760
getting addicted to the adrenaline

714
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,720
surge when it comes down to pimia

715
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:58,120
there's an adrenaline

716
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,399
surge so it actually it the adrenaline

717
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,519
starts to then you get trained where

718
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,880
before you vomit if you even think about

719
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,760
vomiting your adrenals start to rev up

720
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,320
and they start releasing tons and tons

721
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,720
of epinephrine like we're talking loads

722
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,399
of epinephrine saturate the body run up

723
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,760
to the brain and it actually makes you

724
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,880
vomit and then you're in the Trap it

725
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,440
becomes a severe addiction severe

726
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,200
addiction to Adrenaline and that's what

727
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,880
the real thing is happening now say

728
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,640
you're somebody with bulimia and you got

729
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,200
the mercury poisoning which is the 90

730
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,440
90% or

731
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,279
more and you got the mercury poisoning

732
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
in the

733
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,440
brain and it's that variety of that that

734
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,120
variety of bulimia the same thing

735
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
happens when you vomit the adrenaline

736
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,799
goes to the brain and it eases it eases

737
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,720
it helps electrical impulses bypass the

738
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:53,360
Mercury which actually feel like a cure

739
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,159
for the illness for that moment so

740
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,880
vomiting becomes this instinctive

741
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:01,080
wanting to cure the problem through

742
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,200
using epinephrine for using

743
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,799
adrenaline and it become severely

744
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,159
addictive and we're in the binging and

745
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,519
throwing up binging and throwing up

746
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,279
binging and throwing up and then body

747
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,919
image can fit into any of that because

748
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:16,440
body image is into every here's the

749
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,080
problem too it's body image will will

750
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,559
fall into any kind of anorexia or any

751
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,200
kind of

752
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,880
bulimia that say heavy metal caused or

753
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,799
trauma caused the reason why it fits in

754
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,200
because it fits in with everything every

755
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,919
single person right now on planet Earth

756
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,080
especially women they all have to deal

757
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,039
with body image it just so happens that

758
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,640
if you got the mercury poisoning too and

759
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,080
the addiction to the adrenaline from

760
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,799
vomiting and you got the normal body

761
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:46,080
image worry that every girl has growing

762
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,320
up on planet Earth right now because the

763
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,080
world makes it happen like that when

764
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,720
that happens and it's added into that

765
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,440
then that's what takes the blame only

766
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,000
body image takes the blame because

767
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,000
professionals don't know there's mercury

768
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
poisoning involved professionals don't

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,240
know there's a serious addiction to the

770
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,159
adrenaline like no other like a serious

771
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,399
drug so they Point only to body image or

772
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:13,120
some kind of mental

773
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:16,240
illness and this is this is why it's so

774
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
hard so someone with bulimia if they

775
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,519
know they're addicted to Adrenaline and

776
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,440
they have to fight that addiction to the

777
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,159
adrenaline and if they could just bypass

778
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,440
that they can be free they could be

779
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,760
free and that's a big deal that's a

780
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,880
really big deal and also another thing

781
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,639
too is is a carbohydrates critical for

782
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,159
healing anorexia or bulimia and I'm

783
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:40,559
going talk about more about anorexia but

784
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,639
for bulimia a carbohydrate is critical

785
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,720
for healing it because if you starve

786
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,679
carbohydrates someone with bulimia it

787
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,320
only makes it worse they'll end up

788
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,360
binging on carbohydrates just like a

789
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,159
person without bulimia does you put

790
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,880
somebody on a no carb diet they're going

791
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,279
to go on binges or they're going to have

792
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,760
alcohol at night they're going to do

793
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,919
something they're going to do something

794
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
they're going to break their diet

795
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,799
someday and when they do it's going to

796
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,200
be crazy binging what they think is

797
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,960
crazy binging it's going to be eating

798
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,679
four slices of pizza and then back on

799
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,159
their no carb diet for three weeks and

800
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,639
then boom binging again with five Bagels

801
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,360
then boom back to the no carb diet it's

802
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,399
just though they don't have bulimia they

803
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,960
don't have the addiction to the

804
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,159
adrenaline and they're vomiting all the

805
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,440
time so but if you take somebody with

806
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,399
Bimi and you starve them with

807
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,799
carbohydrates God

808
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,519
forbid then you better believe they're

809
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,760
going to they're gonna go on a

810
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,720
binge they're going to go on a binge and

811
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
they're going to vomit and they're going

812
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,519
to get the adrenaline high so they need

813
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,159
a healthy carbohydrate but if you give

814
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,519
them a bad carbohydrate mentally they're

815
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,840
going to be like whoa I got to throw

816
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,480
this up now I'm filled with bad

817
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,000
carbohydrates I'm filled with bagels and

818
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,320
donuts that's why fruit is so critical

819
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,919
for someone with bulimia I've helped

820
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,559
recover people with bulimia over the

821
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,159
decades with just fruit because they

822
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,799
could eat all the fruit they want they

823
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,559
knew it was a healthy carbohydrate and

824
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,159
here's a problem right now

825
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,000
in the industry right now there's a

826
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,360
contamination that got into the

827
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,080
alternative world of healing and now

828
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,559
it's Inc conventional too started in the

829
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,720
alternative world of

830
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,760
healing and and it's the no fruit anti

831
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,320
fruit

832
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,880
movement don't ever let that

833
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,240
contaminated um belief system get in

834
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,480
your way they used it they they're using

835
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,840
it against you you don't even know using

836
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,559
it against you I remember the first

837
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,000
person who who brought

838
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,600
this into the system I know why they did

839
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I know who it is I'm not going to

840
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,519
mention names but I know why they

841
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,039
brought it in they brought it in so that

842
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,480
you wouldn't eat fruit but you would buy

843
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,760
their supplements that had fruit in

844
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,600
it and that's how it started just it was

845
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,840
it was unbelievable it was the perfect

846
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,960
timing for this contamination to bust on

847
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,200
the scene because at the same time there

848
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,760
were all these people trying to get away

849
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,880
from Bad sugars so it was perfect it fit

850
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,519
right in and it took over now fruit was

851
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,120
thrown into the whole basket it's been

852
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,600
disastrous and that's what I mean when I

853
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,840
talk about at the beginning of the show

854
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,279
that very thing I talk about about this

855
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,880
information is not contaminated it's so

856
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,919
critical to know this and when you're

857
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,919
dealing with bulimia fruit is the way to

858
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,320
go because if if if someone with bulimia

859
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,040
knows they have the adrenaline

860
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,800
addiction if someone with bulim knows

861
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,960
that fruit is a healthy carbohydrate

862
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,879
that they need and it won't cause a body

863
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,720
image problem if that's even factored in

864
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:31,720
eventually if that becomes the

865
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,399
escapegoat then fruit is the answer

866
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,480
because the carbohydrate can get to the

867
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,800
brain it can help heal the brain cuz the

868
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,440
brain's not made out of fat it's made

869
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,520
out of glycogen this was figured out by

870
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,240
science actually long ago I mean they

871
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,399
figured this one out but it didn't fit

872
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,000
it didn't fit the

873
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,000
industries it didn't fit the

874
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,359
industries that's a whole another story

875
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,720
of why this is happening where why the

876
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,760
the brain is they're they're avoiding

877
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,920
the the fact that the brain is the the

878
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,880
experts right now are avoiding the

879
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,040
fact that that the brain is is is filled

880
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,640
with

881
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,520
carbohydrate and we're going to do a

882
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,000
whole show on that

883
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,880
someday that's on the list that's on

884
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,400
that big list so somebody with bulimia

885
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,400
has to have fruit in their diet they

886
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,320
have to they have to get the

887
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,000
carbohydrates to help the adrenals they

888
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,800
got to keep the blood sugar balance

889
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
because once blood sugar drops that can

890
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,040
create bulim all on its own when you

891
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,839
have it already when you're addicted to

892
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,359
the adrenaline issue it's critical it's

893
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,280
got to go to the brain it's got to help

894
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,960
the brain heal and then you got to do

895
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,280
the heavy metal detox you got to do the

896
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,560
detox smoothie you got to do the right

897
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,359
kind you got to get a little bit of the

898
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,400
swine spiruline in there a little bit of

899
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,359
the vimergy barley grass juice in there

900
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,000
you got to get a little bit of the um

901
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,200
you got to get some wild blueberries in

902
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,280
there you got to get a little bit of

903
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,920
dolls in there you got to get a little

904
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,319
bit of cantro in there every single day

905
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,760
and you got to start taking the Mercury

906
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,359
down and you start taking that mercury

907
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,760
down and a couple years later the fight

908
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:59,960
won't be so

909
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,560
hard and the person will get stronger

910
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,359
and stronger less occurrences will

911
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,400
happen less addictions to Adrenaline

912
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,119
will happen and less mercury in the body

913
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,680
will happen and somebody can actually

914
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,720
heal from bulimia without being

915
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,440
force-fed massive drugs told they have

916
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,480
this unbelievable mental illness and

917
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,880
suffering occurring this is serious

918
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,200
stuff and you know this can happen of

919
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,160
course they need a support system

920
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,480
anybody with any illness especially Bia

921
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,359
or anorexia needs a support system and I

922
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,200
know that I know that's a difficult part

923
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,599
if that's not there boy does that make

924
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,359
it hard and I get

925
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,880
it I get

926
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,359
it so maybe you know somebody and you

927
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,480
give him a little support on it a little

928
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:41,079
bit goes a long way a little bit goes a

929
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,560
long way you tell us somebody with

930
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,240
bulimia that the whole world isn't

931
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,520
eating disorder they're not the only

932
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,040
ones you tell somebody that so the shame

933
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,839
falls down and and gets Stripped Away

934
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,640
the shame and the guilt and everything

935
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,680
else that comes with it that shouldn't

936
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,480
be

937
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,880
there

938
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,640
that shouldn't be there because that

939
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,400
gets in the way too like no other so if

940
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,079
you know somebody with anorex you tell

941
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,920
them look everybody's got an eating

942
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:08,960
disorder to some degree which just yours

943
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,680
is yeah yours has gotten to a serious

944
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,520
point we need to do something about it

945
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,079
absolutely but it's important that

946
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,599
people and that was another thing too

947
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:18,800
that helped people with bulimia and

948
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,720
anorexia that I met over the years and

949
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,200
many of them was that they were like

950
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,319
what do you mean everybody else has an

951
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,680
eating disorder I said no everybody else

952
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:27,440
has an eating disorder I don't care who

953
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,079
it is I don't care if somebody thinks

954
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
they got it all sewed up something

955
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:33,760
something's going

956
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,800
on something's going on here's the thing

957
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,400
we all have to eat we all have to eat to

958
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,200
survive we all have to eat to live we

959
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,359
have to eat to live here on Earth we

960
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
have to survive that's our fuel intake

961
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,319
that's what does it that's what's

962
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,560
critical we need that fuel intake that

963
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,440
is so important so it's easy for

964
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,280
anything to to slip through her fingers

965
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,800
in one way or another it's easy to eat

966
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,400
the wrong things it's easy to drink

967
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,640
alcohol it's easy to do things that

968
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,240
we're not supposed to do starve

969
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,440
ourselves or whatever it

970
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,359
is that's how fast and and and

971
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,000
easy that Eating Disorders occur and can

972
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:11,960
occur it's that easy so so let's go into

973
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,160
some other stuff here anorexia

974
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,400
definitely Mercury problem also a

975
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,760
percentage of of if something terrible

976
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,839
happened meaning something really

977
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,400
really intense emotionally some kind of

978
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,280
experience some kind of abuse something

979
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,000
happened um that that and here's a

980
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,599
problem with anorexia and bulimia you

981
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,079
can have a combination of both you could

982
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,760
have mostly Mercury and then yes some

983
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,800
kind of emotional physical abuse happens

984
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,680
too in that person's life and then you

985
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,280
got the combination of

986
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,040
both so with anorexia it's about getting

987
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,680
you know it's about the heavy metals too

988
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,079
getting the heavy metals out in some way

989
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,680
some some some way some shape I noticed

990
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,560
that I've seen fruit heal people with

991
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,960
anorexia more than any other food

992
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,240
because mentally it fit in perfectly

993
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,119
where they felt they were eating

994
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,000
something healthy they but then what

995
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,079
they were getting were carbohydrates

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,599
that were so needed for every organ so

997
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,440
they didn't atrophy and with anorexia

998
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,200
your organs atrophy but you can get

999
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,560
those organs to come back but they

1000
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,319
atrophy everything gets smaller pancreas

1001
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,880
gets really small pancreas gets really

1002
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,280
small and you can bring that pancreas

1003
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,359
back everything gets small brain gets

1004
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,319
smaller pancreas gets smaller it's not

1005
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:29,079
just about thinning out losing weight

1006
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,319
and being really really extremely thin

1007
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:33,240
it's not just about it's about the

1008
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:34,920
organs the atrophy and I know I I know

1009
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,200
there's there's some doctors that know

1010
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,760
that that the organs atrophy they

1011
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,240
totally understand that that's that I

1012
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,160
don't think that's

1013
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,839
new but what is new is that fruit is

1014
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,200
critical for bringing back organs that

1015
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:50,000
are atrophied with somebody with

1016
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
anorexia and that's a big deal that's a

1017
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,920
big

1018
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,839
deal and in with somebody with anorexia

1019
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,880
when you have the mercury poisoning in

1020
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:02,560
the brain sending signals not to eat

1021
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,400
creating nausea in the Vagas nerve

1022
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,680
creating nausea and no appetite in the

1023
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,480
Vegas nerve because you can get a signal

1024
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,520
that goes wrong with Mercury creating

1025
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,960
non-

1026
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,319
hunger and you know with anorexia when

1027
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,160
that happens fruit is the greatest

1028
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,560
weapon it's the greatest weapon because

1029
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,240
it doesn't feel it doesn't feel so

1030
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,040
overburdening it doesn't feel like you

1031
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,720
just ate a loaf of bad bread it doesn't

1032
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,480
feel like you ate you know a steak and

1033
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,240
somebody with anorexia forcing them to

1034
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,760
eat chicken or forcing them to eat steak

1035
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,680
could be

1036
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,960
disastrous very difficult on them very

1037
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,160
difficult cuz that's what happens it's

1038
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,240
like eat e eat person has to eat we got

1039
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,319
to get milk in them we got to get it's

1040
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,640
all the wrong

1041
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:48,640
Foods someone with anorexia you got to

1042
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:51,400
get avocado milk in them you blend

1043
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,560
avocado with water in the

1044
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,000
blender and that's something that's

1045
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,560
really really good for somebody with

1046
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,200
anorexia got to do banana milk throwing

1047
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,200
bananas in the blender with water and

1048
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,839
doing lots of banana milk it's critical

1049
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,599
for somebody with anorexia because once

1050
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,200
you feed the brain and your brain make

1051
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,920
the brain stronger even if there's

1052
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,280
vomiting in between this with both

1053
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,640
anorexia and

1054
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,560
bulimia if you feed the brain when you

1055
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,960
do get a chance or say with somebody

1056
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,319
with anorexia that they you know I

1057
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,960
listen I you may be dealing with this

1058
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,760
and suffering with the anorexia for

1059
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,960
years you you know better than anybody

1060
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,960
but if you do eat something you might

1061
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,119
not eat something for a long time after

1062
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,720
that if that happens we want that

1063
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,800
something to actually pay off so if you

1064
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,280
get the banana milk in you or you get

1065
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,160
some melon in you and you get the the

1066
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,000
critical carbohydrates to the brain and

1067
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,839
to the organs to stop atrophying and

1068
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,440
then you end up not eating because the

1069
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,599
because of the reasons of everything

1070
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,200
above with anorexia then then at least

1071
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,640
you fed the

1072
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,520
organs even if the weight's not coming

1073
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,520
back yet something to to

1074
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,640
understand you

1075
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,240
know people who drink coffee every

1076
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,480
single day and they have to rely on it

1077
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,200
that's a disorder that's a disorder

1078
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
right there it's as simple as that

1079
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,400
people eat too much chocolate every day

1080
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,480
that's an eating

1081
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,480
disorder people have to eat chocolate

1082
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,680
every day and then they have to switch

1083
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,920
and get the better chocolate and they're

1084
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,280
still eating it every single day to

1085
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,480
throw it in their smoothies they're told

1086
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,240
by some experts out there it's the

1087
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,480
greatest thing for your Health that's an

1088
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,119
eating disorder I mean they're high on

1089
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,559
chocolate you can't tell but you're

1090
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,920
you're high on chocolate all day long

1091
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,640
and what that does is that does weird

1092
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,319
things it suppresses hunger in different

1093
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:40,720
ways it does different stuff it maxes

1094
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,480
out the adrenals you could still have

1095
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,200
some chocolate but that literally con

1096
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,880
constitutes an eating disorder I yeah

1097
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,240
this is a tough show this is a tough

1098
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,720
show we got to stay light-hearted about

1099
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,160
it at the same time when it comes down

1100
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,359
to those

1101
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,760
things it you know and then the

1102
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:01,079
obsession about foods to

1103
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,640
avoid Obsession about foods to avoid now

1104
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,680
if you have a reason why you're avoiding

1105
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,280
a food if you know you got like the

1106
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,440
Epstein bar virus you don't want to feed

1107
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,760
it eggs you better believe you need to

1108
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,079
avoid eggs absolutely you have to avoid

1109
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,720
eggs you need to you don't want to feed

1110
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,720
a virus of food once you learn that

1111
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,079
that's what feeds a

1112
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,200
food but if you're avoiding a food

1113
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,520
there's no reason at all you're not

1114
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,280
dealing with a health problem and you're

1115
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,760
avoiding a food that's really not that

1116
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,280
bad for anybody and you're avoiding it

1117
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,920
because you heard something about it and

1118
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,040
you're avoiding with everything you

1119
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,359
got it's probably not there's probably

1120
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,280
other things you do in your diet that

1121
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,760
are probably worse put it that way I

1122
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,760
mean there's so many different ways to

1123
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,960
go it's unbelievable and then there's

1124
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
underlying illness freeding disorders

1125
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,559
there's

1126
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,920
hypoglycemia there's adrenaline issues I

1127
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,200
mean there's adrenal fatigue

1128
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,119
hypoglycemia electrolyte deficiencies

1129
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,079
neurotransmitter deficiencies in people

1130
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,280
every single day people suffering with

1131
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,880
all kinds of problems people that are

1132
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,480
getting diagnosed with bipolar but

1133
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,760
really they're having serious problems

1134
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,760
with their blood sugar and they're

1135
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,079
diagnosed with bipolar being bipolar and

1136
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,000
and really they just have a blood sugar

1137
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,800
problem where it's going up and down too

1138
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,400
fast and it can't stabilize because of

1139
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,079
adrenals in the liver because the liver

1140
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,240
is sluggish there's 15y olds 18y olds

1141
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,119
19y olds were really sluggish

1142
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,880
livers and and so they can't balance the

1143
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,599
can't balance the glucose in in their

1144
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,400
blood so they're they're having mood

1145
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,040
swings left and right up and down then

1146
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,680
they get thrown in diagnosis then they

1147
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,760
get put on riddle and then they get put

1148
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,400
on they get put on all these kinds of

1149
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,280
drugs and and whatever it

1150
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,880
is and then you have that going on when

1151
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,920
really and all that does is end up

1152
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,160
creating an eating disorder when really

1153
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,200
someone needs to teach somebody that has

1154
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,079
hypoglycemia caused by either adrenal

1155
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,559
fatigue when they're young or a liver

1156
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,640
problem how to

1157
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,400
eat cuz if you if you don't then it

1158
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,119
could become a serious eating disorder

1159
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,680
and lead to an eating

1160
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,079
disorder and so for instance when you

1161
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,000
have that kind of up and down in the

1162
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,160
mood swings you have to eat every hour

1163
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,559
hour and a half and it has to be

1164
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,920
something that has a sodium in it like a

1165
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,000
sodium in it in the sense where it has

1166
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,480
to be celery stick it has to be some

1167
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,640
spinach it has to be um um you know it

1168
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,119
has to be some spinach celery has to be

1169
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:29,040
some guacamole has to be handful of nuts

1170
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:32,680
has to be um uh cucumber slices

1171
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,240
apples has to be lemon water all these

1172
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,359
different things you need in and out of

1173
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,079
it all um raw honey lemon water that's a

1174
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,720
great mix if you put that together and

1175
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:42,920
you can even put a little touch of sea

1176
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,359
salt in there if you wanted to and make

1177
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,680
a drink out of that there's different

1178
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:47,960
things there different ways of keeping

1179
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,800
bruly balanced or maybe you're just

1180
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,599
having some trail mix but it's every

1181
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,240
hour or maybe you're just having some

1182
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,400
hummus every

1183
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:58,359
hour but that's what you need when it

1184
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,400
comes down to anybody with any kind of

1185
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:02,319
hypoglycemia that's getting mood swings

1186
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
meaning the hypoglycemia mood swings

1187
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,839
where it's like up and down and all over

1188
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,040
the

1189
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:09,520
place you have to eat like this and then

1190
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,720
someone could say hey that person is the

1191
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,079
eating disorder because they have to eat

1192
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,839
every hour to keep themselves balance

1193
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,200
now they have a real reason why they

1194
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,839
have to they have a condition that's

1195
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,880
developing and this is a real way of

1196
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:20,559
fixing it just like if someone has

1197
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,040
straight adrenal fatigue this is a real

1198
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,599
way of fixing

1199
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,559
it but the eating disorder can come from

1200
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,559
somebody else complaining to bet to

1201
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,000
somebody about what they're doing and

1202
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:32,520
how they don't like it that alone can

1203
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,599
can be challenging and creating a

1204
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,559
disorder I mean there's also blame

1205
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:37,640
everywhere everybody's blaming everybody

1206
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,240
what they're eating and if they're

1207
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,240
eating right everybody has their own

1208
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,559
idea of how to eat and what to eat it's

1209
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,960
insane and that alone can create to

1210
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,079
eating disorders in every single person

1211
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,680
I'm going to tell you right now the

1212
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,599
information I've ever given out in food

1213
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,280
for illnesses and food for problems and

1214
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,160
everything else and how you eat there's

1215
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:57,119
reasons behind it reasons that research

1216
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,359
signed stor understand or reasons that

1217
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,720
are just that are above the trends out

1218
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,839
there about how to stay healthy and

1219
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,680
heal and that's

1220
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,440
different and I'm saying that's not even

1221
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,079
100% perfect in the sense because if

1222
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,040
someone's doing that and they finally

1223
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,480
heal and they're better they might be

1224
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,359
afraid to stop I've had people that have

1225
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,520
healed themselves from the worst worst

1226
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,839
adrenal fatigue on the planet I mean

1227
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,240
literally they were just they couldn't

1228
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:24,640
get out of bed they had neuro fatigue

1229
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,119
and adrenal fatigue from from a virus

1230
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,520
and from the fact that they're adrenals

1231
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:30,960
were spent I couldn't even get a bed I

1232
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:33,319
had them eating every 45 minutes every

1233
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,319
45 minutes I recovered them got them

1234
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:37,319
moving again got them out of bed got

1235
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,839
their life back 3 years later they were

1236
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,559
stronger than ever but afraid to drop

1237
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:43,040
the every 45 minutes they would call me

1238
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,359
and say look I'm afraid I'm afraid to

1239
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,920
stop eat it's to stop eating every 45

1240
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,040
minutes because it saved my life I would

1241
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,920
say no you're good you're acting like

1242
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,800
you're you're acting like you're going

1243
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,000
to get your eating disorder now you can

1244
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:00,200
go an hour and a half you got strong you

1245
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,760
can go 2 hours you got strong you can go

1246
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:06,079
if you had to you can go 3 hours if you

1247
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,280
had to you got strong and then they have

1248
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,720
they have to break it so even when you

1249
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,559
heal somebody they can get a little bit

1250
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,079
of a of an OCD or a little bit of a

1251
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,559
eating sore even after you healed them

1252
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,960
from a terrible illness or something

1253
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,800
that was terrible or something that was

1254
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,480
keeping them down in their life so just

1255
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,240
imagine when that's not even in the mix

1256
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,800
and all the people out there just this

1257
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,440
is how you eat this is how you eat this

1258
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,440
is the new way this is the diet you want

1259
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,960
to be on um you have to have all this

1260
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,920
chocolate you have to have all this you

1261
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,920
have to have this it's

1262
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,520
unbelievable and yeah if you're anorexic

1263
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,040
that just means you're you got a mental

1264
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,839
illness and that's really what it is and

1265
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,319
you need to eat eat eat eat

1266
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,720
eat there's more to it than that of

1267
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,040
course you have to eat but there's more

1268
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:51,400
to it than that there's so much there

1269
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:55,160
there's so much

1270
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,640
there the people that avoid food all day

1271
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,520
and drink at night that's a terrible

1272
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,480
eating

1273
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,799
disorder I mean there's a people that

1274
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,040
they're out in the workforce every day

1275
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:04,520
they're out there every day they avoid

1276
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,680
food all day they just avoid food all

1277
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,200
day long well then they then they have

1278
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,160
these reasons

1279
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,680
why I that's a that's a major drinking I

1280
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
mean that's a major drinking disorder

1281
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,440
too that can happen but there's people

1282
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,400
that avoid food all day that don't drink

1283
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,720
and then eat that one meal at night you

1284
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,720
know and and mean but there's some

1285
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,079
people that legitly they they have a job

1286
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,280
and they're forced to do that I mean I

1287
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:33,079
know nurses that literally don't have a

1288
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:35,520
a minute to eat anything I mean they're

1289
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,960
running around all day long it's so

1290
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,720
difficult for them to even have a snack

1291
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,400
I mean you might be one of them right it

1292
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,559
is so difficult to even have a snack or

1293
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,280
to eat right or for lunch and and and

1294
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,200
the lunch the lunch room in the

1295
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,839
hospitals alone are just terrifying

1296
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,720
they're better than they were 20 years

1297
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,160
ago but they can they're still not that

1298
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,280
great especially if you have a health

1299
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,839
condition you're trying to work with or

1300
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,480
adrenal fatigue and you're pushed all

1301
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:59,079
day long as an nurse and at home you get

1302
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,880
home and you're just eating and eating I

1303
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,040
totally understand but this it's yeah so

1304
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,599
it's hard to avoid now creating some

1305
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,720
kind of small eating disorder because

1306
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,040
you're forced into it you're pushed into

1307
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,720
it totally agree well let's be happy

1308
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,440
about something it's okay to have Eating

1309
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,119
Disorders okay it's okay to have some

1310
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,240
kind of eating disorder and guess what

1311
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,680
we all got them we all got them in some

1312
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:23,359
way some shape some fashion somehow we

1313
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,559
all have some or one or something from

1314
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,599
high school kids to college kids to

1315
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,559
adults in Workforce to um to to the

1316
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:36,520
older generation to Elders I've Seen It

1317
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:39,839
All I've Seen It All I've seen people in

1318
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,480
their 80s eat a big big pie filled with

1319
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:44,359
wheat and lard and everything but eat

1320
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,400
the whole damn pie like a whole

1321
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:49,720
pie and and you know like 85 years old

1322
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,400
but but eating a whole pie at

1323
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:55,799
once I've seen it and you know and then

1324
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,799
stuffed and can't breathe how how I've I

1325
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:59,440
seen it I've had people call me in that

1326
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:03,400
condition or I've had somebody call for

1327
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,400
the because the grandfather ate a whole

1328
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,359
pie I've seen it

1329
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,720
all and and and and the grandfather

1330
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,839
would tell you he's never had an eating

1331
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,520
disorder his whole life he' been eating

1332
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:16,960
fine his whole

1333
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:19,640
life and then then I then I hear from

1334
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,720
the grandchild I hear for the grandchild

1335
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,520
um his granddaughter that he's been he's

1336
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,240
been eating till he can't breathe on and

1337
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:31,160
off his whole life always been stuffing

1338
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,960
himself so I mean it's just like this

1339
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,440
it's like this getting your liver

1340
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,359
stronger is important with any kind of

1341
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,720
eating disorder that means getting lots

1342
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,599
of leafy greens when you can getting

1343
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,880
lots of fruits and leafy greens if you

1344
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,880
eat animal protein minimize it to one

1345
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,440
serving a day there's nothing wrong with

1346
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,960
that so what I'm not against animal

1347
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,599
protein you could have one serving a day

1348
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,839
of it if you're a vegan don't eat

1349
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:54,640
barrels and barrels and nuts have a

1350
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:56,960
handful of nuts periodically throughout

1351
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,599
the day a a couple of handfuls do more

1352
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,319
leafy greens do more

1353
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,040
fruits do some winter squash do things

1354
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,680
like that if you're 100% raw you don't

1355
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,280
have to do you know a winter squash

1356
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,000
that's cooked or whatever you can be all

1357
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,599
raw do lots of leafy greens lots of

1358
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,520
fruits if you're plant-based and all raw

1359
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,839
you can do some nuts and seeds if you're

1360
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,520
vegetarian if you're vegetarian try not

1361
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,960
to you know overdo fish make sure it's

1362
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,920
salmon if you're doing fish it's a

1363
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,000
better one than most of

1364
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,960
them and if you're you know if you're a

1365
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,799
meat eater and you're big on meat eater

1366
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,559
meat eating just do you know one serving

1367
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:28,960
of meat day make sure there's more leafy

1368
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,280
greens more vegetables more fruits

1369
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,520
especially leafy greens in your diet to

1370
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,160
help your liver clean up it can prevent

1371
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,920
any kind of eating disorder getting the

1372
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,319
liver cleaned up getting more fruit in

1373
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,520
the diet gets glucose to the liver and

1374
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:45,799
the Brain which can avoid even the most

1375
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,839
basic food disorder eating disorder it's

1376
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:50,000
incredible if you're feeling like you

1377
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,960
got any kind of Health concern at all

1378
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,040
you want to keep your adrenal strong you

1379
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,480
want to eat every 2 hours if you feel

1380
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,079
like you got adrenal fatigue you eat eat

1381
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,240
every hour if you feel like you got

1382
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,000
neuro fatigue you eat every hour and you

1383
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,280
just do this every day and you have

1384
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,280
snacks all day long and you keep enough

1385
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,920
food going in that's important for any

1386
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,440
kind of adrenal issues even liver issues

1387
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:14,880
even brain issues bipolar ups and downs

1388
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,440
mood swings all that kind of thing okay

1389
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,160
very important ADHD all of it you want

1390
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,000
to keep food coming and you don't want

1391
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,400
there's nothing worse than having add or

1392
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,680
ADHD and not eating for 4 hours but then

1393
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,240
taking medication but not eating for 4

1394
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,680
hours and that's a disaster for for an

1395
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,079
eating disorder like that's that's

1396
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,520
heading to an eating disorder that alone

1397
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,960
I'm giving you every T tidbit I can in

1398
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:41,960
the in the time we

1399
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:46,000
have so these are some this is this is

1400
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:47,680
all this is all just part of it all and

1401
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,160
I know I'm harsh when I say look I know

1402
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,839
I'm harsh I when I say anyone who still

1403
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,200
thinks the brain is made out of fat we

1404
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,440
being told right now by professionals is

1405
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,960
professionals just don't know no the

1406
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,520
brain isn't made out of fat it's got

1407
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,079
traces of fats and they are important

1408
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:03,760
but they're nothing like the importance

1409
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,079
of the carbohydrates and the glycogen

1410
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,599
that's stored inside the brain that

1411
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:09,359
keeps electrical impulses moving and it

1412
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,200
keeps the neurotransmitter strong

1413
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:12,760
glucose is actually one of the most

1414
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,559
critical components to an electrical

1415
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:17,760
impulse inside the brain running down a

1416
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,319
neurot neuron to save your butt every

1417
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,000
day and this is done through

1418
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,280
carbohydrates don't eat donuts don't eat

1419
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
