[10.96 - 16.36] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[14.67 - 19.52] [Music]
[16.36 - 21.16] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[19.52 - 23.76] you're listening to the medical medium
[21.16 - 27.08] radio show where each week I talk about
[23.76 - 29.16] the most advanced healing information
[27.08 - 31.76] and secrets about health much of which
[29.16 - 34.24] is not found anywhere else and it's
[31.76 - 36.12] decades ahead of what's out there now
[34.24 - 38.40] and that that just reminded me about
[36.12 - 40.92] something you guys that you know back
[38.40 - 43.00] when back a few decades ago and just
[40.92 - 44.84] even even not even a few decades ago
[43.00 - 47.00] let's just go two decades ago the
[44.84 - 48.96] internet wasn't in it you know it wasn't
[47.00 - 51.88] in that stage it was in obviously if
[48.96 - 54.88] there was even an internet at that time
[51.88 - 57.68] and you know when someone was sick when
[54.88 - 60.00] someone was sick and they had symptoms
[57.68 - 61.36] they had like fatigue or they couldn't
[60.00 - 63.32] function well or they had a weak
[61.36 - 67.08] sensitive central nervous system or they
[63.32 - 69.48] had vertigo balance issues being dizzy
[67.08 - 72.48] um anything of that sort they weren't
[69.48 - 75.92] well for some reason sinus infections
[72.48 - 78.28] chronically chronic UTI mystery symptoms
[75.92 - 80.56] aches and pains neuralgia you know
[78.28 - 83.40] tingles and numbness the list goes on
[80.56 - 85.84] migraines all unexplainable all mystery
[83.40 - 88.68] when someone had all that there was
[85.84 - 90.48] really no support system it didn't exist
[88.68 - 93.56] if you walked into a
[90.48 - 95.12] drugstore you couldn't get eation this
[93.56 - 97.64] is hysterical you know I purposely
[95.12 - 100.48] walked into a drugstore a long time ago
[97.64 - 102.88] and this is decades ago I walked into
[100.48 - 104.16] the drugstore to look at the vitamins
[102.88 - 106.48] see if they had vitamins in the
[104.16 - 109.24] drugstore and they had at the time you
[106.48 - 111.12] know two major company vitamins you
[109.24 - 112.84] probably know who they are right I'm not
[111.12 - 115.20] going to mention any names and they're
[112.84 - 116.64] just sitting on the shelf there and I
[115.20 - 119.92] went to the pharmacist I said do you
[116.64 - 123.52] guys have any eonia and they laughed at
[119.92 - 125.60] at me they laughed at me literally
[123.52 - 128.28] laughed me out of the
[125.60 - 131.20] pharmacy okay I'm just telling you right
[128.28 - 133.16] now and okay sure this is 25 30 years
[131.20 - 134.76] ago but I'm telling you right now laugh
[133.16 - 136.92] me out of the pharmacy think about that
[134.76 - 140.44] for a minute okay and that wasn't just
[136.92 - 142.68] there it was it was Nationwide like that
[140.44 - 145.32] so what does that tell you just that
[142.68 - 147.84] alone so when you were sick back then
[145.32 - 149.20] with anything and some of you many of
[147.84 - 150.84] you probably experienced it were are you
[149.20 - 153.24] kidding I mean that's the whole point if
[150.84 - 156.80] you were sick back then with
[153.24 - 159.32] anything good luck good luck now you
[156.80 - 162.64] would think things are actually better
[159.32 - 164.16] now we have the internet thank God we
[162.64 - 166.96] have all these different things thank
[164.16 - 168.48] God okay and and you know we have
[166.96 - 170.56] communication you think things would be
[168.48 - 173.36] better now now you had all these fancy
[170.56 - 175.44] books out we got experts everywhere but
[173.36 - 178.60] chronic illness is
[175.44 - 181.60] quadrupling forget quadruple it's it's
[178.60 - 184.76] way past that it's way past it it's it's
[181.60 - 187.80] by 10 it's by 15 times past it tripling
[184.76 - 189.80] doubling doubling times five it that's
[187.80 - 191.80] where chronic illness is going and
[189.80 - 193.64] everybody's got a symptom you may know
[191.80 - 196.00] people you may know family members you
[193.64 - 199.08] you may know friends you may know loved
[196.00 - 201.60] ones you may know anybody that's got a
[199.08 - 203.44] problem that's got something and here's
[201.60 - 205.36] the problem the problem is there's the
[203.44 - 207.24] misinformation that's out there both
[205.36 - 210.00] conventionally and alternatively it's
[207.24 - 212.36] riddled in there everywhere so the iCal
[210.00 - 213.84] medium radio show we're clearing that up
[212.36 - 215.20] that's the whole point you stay with me
[213.84 - 217.04] for the ride we're going to clear up
[215.20 - 219.16] each each show we're going to just just
[217.04 - 221.16] move forward all together we're going to
[219.16 - 222.80] work together on this because I've said
[221.16 - 224.48] it before in some of the last shows I
[222.80 - 226.36] need your help too to get the
[224.48 - 228.00] information out there so you can help
[226.36 - 229.80] and spread that and spread it to your
[228.00 - 232.28] family and help people and help a friend
[229.80 - 233.96] or a stranger that you run into because
[232.28 - 236.08] it's incredible when that occurs because
[233.96 - 238.44] you offer assistance just by accident
[236.08 - 241.28] also just by just just being it just
[238.44 - 244.00] starts to happen and the world starts to
[241.28 - 245.64] change but back then forget it you get
[244.00 - 247.80] chronic fatigue syndrome you're just
[245.64 - 249.60] you're you're just stupid that's all
[247.80 - 251.16] you're just stupid if it's something
[249.60 - 253.04] that can't be tested for and measured
[251.16 - 255.48] you're just you're just stupid that's
[253.04 - 257.76] how bad it was it's still that bad in
[255.48 - 261.00] other ways we're still in these weird
[257.76 - 262.84] places now a lot of misinformation a lot
[261.00 - 265.16] of trouble we're still we're still the
[262.84 - 267.44] reason why is because we're dealing with
[265.16 - 269.80] Antiquities we're dealing with antique
[267.44 - 271.80] tests antique information even with a
[269.80 - 273.24] Best Equipment the best functional
[271.80 - 275.76] equipment but you know the best
[273.24 - 277.88] alternative you name it we're still in
[275.76 - 280.76] the Dark Ages so we have to clear this
[277.88 - 282.36] up because you don't have 10 years I
[280.76 - 284.28] don't have 10 years we don't have 20
[282.36 - 286.28] years I don't have 30 years to wait for
[284.28 - 288.60] answers life is precious and it has to
[286.28 - 291.20] be cleared up now and that's what we're
[288.60 - 294.04] doing okay so today's show we're talking
[291.20 - 296.60] about grains The Good the Bad and the
[294.04 - 298.80] Ugly are grains good for you are they
[296.60 - 300.88] bad for you are they good for you are
[298.80 - 303.40] they bad for you am I driving you crazy

[305.36 - 308.92] just going to relax I'm going to Calment
[307.12 - 310.96] down we're going to have to get our seat
[308.92 - 313.72] bels on for sure okay for this one cuz
[310.96 - 317.52] grains is a big topic and I don't mean
[313.72 - 319.84] greens I'm not saying greens okay I'm
[317.52 - 322.44] saying grains all right we're going to
[319.84 - 325.64] talk about these grains it's really
[322.44 - 327.84] important um so I'm excited so let's
[325.64 - 329.88] let's talk about this hey you know and
[327.84 - 331.60] and look remember there's an LA event
[329.88 - 333.72] coming up Los Angeles there's an event
[331.60 - 336.56] coming up I'm really excited for it
[333.72 - 338.24] because since I was young when Spirit
[336.56 - 339.72] was talking to me and still does of
[338.24 - 342.32] course and I hear Spirit perfectly clear
[339.72 - 345.32] and I diagnose my grandmother of lung
[342.32 - 347.64] cancer after that you know after that
[345.32 - 350.16] and growing up a little bit I asked
[347.64 - 352.84] Spirit what more can I do what more can
[350.16 - 354.44] I do for everyone I saw the suffering
[352.84 - 356.56] Spirit was telling me everything that
[354.44 - 360.28] was wrong with everybody I remember
[356.56 - 362.84] being at this convention with my parents
[360.28 - 365.68] and I was 8 years old and I was at this
[362.84 - 368.28] convention and you know and I was it was
[365.68 - 370.16] really crowded and anyone who knows me
[368.28 - 372.92] or knows anything about me knows that I
[370.16 - 374.52] go blind when I'm around too many people
[372.92 - 376.40] that's why at the events I practically
[374.52 - 378.40] fall off the stage it's it's actually
[376.40 - 380.60] kind of humorous and embarrassing at the
[378.40 - 382.32] same time because the more readings I do
[380.60 - 383.64] it's it's why I have an assistant come
[382.32 - 385.80] with me everywhere it's why I have to go
[383.64 - 387.76] on the plane with my assistant because
[385.80 - 389.76] 150 passengers on the plane I'm going to
[387.76 - 391.80] get readings for every last one of them
[389.76 - 394.00] there's no break there's no relaxing
[391.80 - 396.12] there's no going on a cruise and one
[394.00 - 398.32] medium said to me oh that that's that's
[396.12 - 400.64] I I could I can't shut it off either
[398.32 - 402.72] that's not true because I see everybody
[400.64 - 405.76] going on cruises I see everybody having
[402.72 - 407.84] fun everybody taking vacations trust me
[405.76 - 410.04] everybody can shut it down enough I
[407.84 - 412.68] can't shut it down and so the
[410.04 - 414.32] information's going to come nonstop it's
[412.68 - 415.68] always been like like this I'm going to
[414.32 - 417.00] know if someone's got a brain tumor on
[415.68 - 418.48] the plane I'm going to know if somebody
[417.00 - 420.56] walking by's got diabetes I'm going to
[418.48 - 422.76] know if someone's got this and what
[420.56 - 425.08] happens though is because of that I'm
[422.76 - 427.60] forced to scan and I'm forced to hear
[425.08 - 429.56] spirit and I start going blind so I go
[427.60 - 431.16] almost permanently like mostly blind
[429.56 - 434.44] depending on the situation and how many
[431.16 - 437.00] people so at the events it gets kind of
[434.44 - 438.76] funny so I asked so what happened when I
[437.00 - 440.48] was younger I asked people you know I
[438.76 - 442.24] mean I asked Spirit sorry about this I
[440.48 - 443.36] asked Spirit what can I do what else can
[442.24 - 445.64] I do and I remember being at a
[443.36 - 447.64] convention with my family and it was
[445.64 - 450.84] crowded it was mobbed and I was getting
[447.64 - 453.56] the readings Non-Stop Non-Stop and I
[450.84 - 456.48] came across this one person who was
[453.56 - 458.84] really suffering just suffering really
[456.48 - 460.88] bad had some terrible things going on
[458.84 - 462.60] when I mean terrible means you know when
[460.88 - 465.04] I looked inside the body I saw
[462.60 - 466.84] everything wrong that was imaginable and
[465.04 - 469.28] I was like how is this person even
[466.84 - 471.32] standing and I said to Spirit what can I
[469.28 - 474.52] do and spirit says let's do the light
[471.32 - 476.28] blast let's do the light technique I'll
[474.52 - 477.84] send down spirit said to me I'll send
[476.28 - 479.88] down light on the crown of the person's
[477.84 - 482.12] head full throttle
[479.88 - 486.28] you just work with me on it and let's do
[482.12 - 488.44] it we sent the light down on the person
[486.28 - 489.88] and then I started doing it to everybody
[488.44 - 492.00] that's around me everybody at the
[489.88 - 494.52] convention sending the light down
[492.00 - 497.52] practicing and from there on out there
[494.52 - 500.00] on out I learn that technique starting
[497.52 - 502.44] with you know round 8 years old really
[500.00 - 503.80] perfecting it and I do it at the events
[502.44 - 505.24] I don't care what it takes I don't care
[503.80 - 507.68] if it exhaust me I don't care if you
[505.24 - 509.84] have to scrape me off the floor at the
[507.68 - 512.28] end of the event and just in literally

[610.36 - 615.52] on are you afraid of fruit um you know
[613.88 - 617.24] all these questions you they come to
[615.52 - 620.32] mind because I hear people all the time
[617.24 - 622.24] people ask me Anthony are grains good
[620.32 - 624.56] for us are they good for us they bad for
[622.24 - 626.16] us they good for us and I hear this all
[624.56 - 629.36] the time I hear it all day long I mean I
[626.16 - 632.08] hear it from everybody and there are are
[629.36 - 635.04] answers to this question there are but
[632.08 - 636.68] first we have to explore some
[635.04 - 637.84] misunderstandings we have to explore
[636.68 - 639.20] some misunder understandings are you
[637.84 - 641.08] guys open for that are we going to do
[639.20 - 643.40] that I'm just going to sip a little bit
[641.08 - 645.92] of this tea right
[643.40 - 648.04] here it's a grainfree
[645.92 - 651.72] tea
[648.04 - 654.20] um all right so here's the deal we have
[651.72 - 656.48] to understand something about autoimmune
[654.20 - 659.92] we have to we have to visit the
[656.48 - 662.24] autoimmune topic I know I drive you guys
[659.92 - 664.64] crazy sometimes with it but it's one of
[662.24 - 669.72] the greatest mistakes of all time it's
[664.64 - 672.36] the greatest mistake next to
[669.72 - 675.32] nuclear nuclear weapons that are out
[672.36 - 679.56] there sitting in bunkers okay this is
[675.32 - 682.24] this is the next greatest mistake of all
[679.56 - 684.44] history and of all time on the planet
[682.24 - 685.96] and it's the confusion of autoimmune
[684.44 - 687.00] where conventional and alternative
[685.96 - 689.60] doctors and
[687.00 - 692.24] practitioners believe that autoimmune is
[689.60 - 695.00] the body attacking itself this could
[692.24 - 697.96] never be more wrong than ever before
[695.00 - 700.00] this happened due to the fact that
[697.96 - 701.72] modern medicine doesn't know what's
[700.00 - 703.68] wrong with someone and what's causing
[701.72 - 706.64] their lupus symptoms their Celiac
[703.68 - 707.84] problem their their um colitis problem
[706.64 - 710.52] with their intestinal tract their
[707.84 - 712.32] Hashimoto thyroiditis and and Medicine
[710.52 - 714.04] Medical Research Medical Science doesn't
[712.32 - 717.12] know what causes it so guess who takes
[714.04 - 719.36] the blame you your body takes the blame
[717.12 - 722.64] 100% that's the easiest way out the
[719.36 - 725.00] greatest way out for medical denial it's
[722.64 - 726.32] the greatest way so you feel like crap
[725.00 - 727.88] you feel like your body's attacking
[726.32 - 729.68] itself you feel like your body's
[727.88 - 732.36] betraying you you like the way that
[729.68 - 734.72] feels I don't I don't like the way that
[732.36 - 736.76] feels I had someone tell me someone tell
[734.72 - 738.84] me who just you know believes in
[736.76 - 740.36] alternative medicine you know enough and
[738.84 - 743.24] believes in you know conventional
[740.36 - 745.48] medicine but very this person's very
[743.24 - 747.24] like you know um what is it black and
[745.48 - 749.56] white in many ways or whatever which is
[747.24 - 751.96] totally cool I'm not saying that's bad
[749.56 - 754.28] and and this person's just like you know
[751.96 - 756.28] no no medical science medical research
[754.28 - 757.96] understands they know what autoimmune is
[756.28 - 759.88] and I'm like no they don't they don't
[757.96 - 762.16] know what it is it's not the body
[759.88 - 764.68] attacking itself and they're like well
[762.16 - 768.60] well of course it is and I'm like no of
[764.68 - 770.76] course it's not of course it's not what
[768.60 - 772.48] happens is with hosoo thyroiditis your
[770.76 - 774.04] thyroid gets inflamed because there's a
[772.48 - 775.36] pathogen called Epstein bar which I
[774.04 - 777.00] brought to the attention to the world
[775.36 - 780.40] years ago and I'm bringing attention to
[777.00 - 782.32] the world now and and we can fact check
[780.40 - 784.40] it we could backdate it I brought that
[782.32 - 785.64] to the world and you're hearing it here
[784.40 - 787.36] at the show and you're going to hear it
[785.64 - 789.88] now all the time out there in other
[787.36 - 792.24] books coming out you name it AB bar
[789.88 - 793.72] causes hasim modus thyroiditis all stems
[792.24 - 796.04] from me with the information brought
[793.72 - 798.04] from Spirit I'm boasting on that but
[796.04 - 800.08] it's a fact so you know that any new any
[798.04 - 802.68] new people logging into this show today
[800.08 - 804.72] knows that it comes from here and it's
[802.68 - 806.28] important to know so I want you to stay
[804.72 - 808.92] tuned for further shows so you get
[806.28 - 813.12] information that's moving people forward
[808.92 - 815.88] information that's Advanced and so it's
[813.12 - 818.64] what what happens is autoimmune is just
[815.88 - 821.48] the body producing anti Auto antibodies
[818.64 - 824.16] and antibodies to attack the virus not
[821.48 - 826.04] the body not the physical body not the
[824.16 - 828.88] physical organs they're not being
[826.04 - 831.32] attacked at all in fact your body is
[828.88 - 834.20] working handin hand to get rid of a
[831.32 - 838.44] pathogen that's inflaming you so hear me
[834.20 - 841.76] out a pathogen virus like Hashimoto
[838.44 - 843.80] thyroid itis it's a virus inflaming the
[841.76 - 845.72] thyroid the virus is inflaming the
[843.80 - 848.04] thyroid not the body the body's not
[845.72 - 850.36] inflaming the the thyroid it's a virus
[848.04 - 851.88] it's Epstein bar same thing with all
[850.36 - 853.96] these other different autoimmune things
[851.88 - 857.12] rheumatoid arthritis is a virus
[853.96 - 860.16] inflaming the joints and the body is
[857.12 - 863.56] trying to stop it and inflammation is
[860.16 - 865.52] created by the pathogen inflaming the
[863.56 - 867.24] joints and if you don't look if you want
[865.52 - 869.68] to know more about this you you get the
[867.24 - 871.32] medical medium book to be with and then
[869.68 - 874.76] you know I talk about even more in
[871.32 - 877.28] life-changing foods but what happens
[874.76 - 879.80] here is that this confusion is one of
[877.28 - 881.72] the worst of all time it really is I
[879.80 - 884.60] could go into a lot of other ones too
[881.72 - 887.16] but this one's one of the worst because
[884.60 - 891.40] it breaks down your immune system and
[887.16 - 894.12] messes you up messes you up because if
[891.40 - 897.32] you think your body's attacking itself
[894.12 - 899.40] you don't stand a chance you don't stand
[897.32 - 901.28] a chance it's like like that's saying a
[899.40 - 903.04] snowball's chance in hell or whatever it
[901.28 - 904.16] is whatever it is you're not going to
[903.04 - 907.16] stand a
[904.16 - 911.44] chance so you have to rewire that right
[907.16 - 913.16] now bam it's rewired I'm telling you so
[911.44 - 915.00] it's important to know your body doesn't
[913.16 - 918.44] attack itself and I'm not talking about
[915.00 - 920.08] it on a spiritual way I'm talking on a
[918.44 - 921.80] physical way I'm talking about science
[920.08 - 924.56] that's not discovered that way that's
[921.80 - 928.36] how I'm talking about it right here okay
[924.56 - 930.28] and so the bottom line is is we have to
[928.36 - 931.56] you have to adopt that you have to make
[930.28 - 933.08] that a belief system you're going to
[931.56 - 937.08] have to make that part of a factual
[933.08 - 939.88] belief system because what happens is
[937.08 - 943.24] autoimmune is really now wrapped up with
[939.88 - 946.28] the grain thing grains you guys know
[943.24 - 949.00] what I'm talking about you do right it's
[946.28 - 951.92] all about grains causing autoimmune
[949.00 - 955.28] grains causing inflammation that's not
[951.92 - 959.28] accurate either that's not accurate at
[955.28 - 962.80] all so wheat causing inflammation that's
[959.28 - 965.60] not accurate at all I don't care if it's
[962.80 - 968.80] the best newest autoimmune book that hit
[965.60 - 971.84] the Shelf just recently or coming up or
[968.80 - 974.00] whatever it is if it doesn't realize it
[971.84 - 975.92] in that book or whoever's writing that
[974.00 - 978.32] or doing whatever or talking on some
[975.92 - 980.44] podcast if they don't realize it's the
[978.32 - 984.68] wheat feeding a
[980.44 - 987.40] pathogen such as a virus or bacteria and
[984.68 - 990.12] that virus and bacteria eats the wheat
[987.40 - 993.60] and then eliminates a
[990.12 - 996.28] toxin or the virus and the pathogen eat
[993.60 - 1000.64] the wheat and grow stronger and cause
[996.28 - 1003.00] more damage that's the truth if no one
[1000.64 - 1004.96] has that in their their books yet which
[1003.00 - 1006.72] they don't we look out for that stuff
[1004.96 - 1008.96] cuz we want everybody moving forward we
[1006.72 - 1010.48] want people to know the truth then you
[1008.96 - 1012.40] know what you're dealing with something
[1010.48 - 1014.00] that's already an antique you may as
[1012.40 - 1015.88] well just I said this before and I'm
[1014.00 - 1017.80] saying it again may as well just go
[1015.88 - 1020.28] antique antiquing on the weekend and
[1017.80 - 1022.00] come home with a l lamp an old lamp
[1020.28 - 1024.88] you're better off so this is really
[1022.00 - 1027.20] important this is important to know this
[1024.88 - 1029.00] and and I'm I'm not saying oh ho ho this
[1027.20 - 1031.64] is because Anthony's got all the answers
[1029.00 - 1033.12] no this is just how it works what
[1031.64 - 1035.88] happens is there's people out there that
[1033.12 - 1037.20] are 70 years old that feel fine they
[1035.88 - 1039.08] don't have Celiac they don't have
[1037.20 - 1041.04] anything going on they don't have you
[1039.08 - 1043.64] know all they just don't have nothing
[1041.04 - 1045.72] going on I know people like that I was
[1043.64 - 1048.84] just talking to a friend who's uh whose
[1045.72 - 1051.20] you know parent is 96 now and nothing
[1048.84 - 1054.28] going on nothing to complain about at
[1051.20 - 1055.20] all guess what she eats she eats Bagels
[1054.28 - 1058.96] wheat
[1055.20 - 1061.32] Bagels from from Dunkin Donuts she eats
[1058.96 - 1063.80] wheat Bagels from Dunkin Donuts she puts
[1061.32 - 1066.16] cream cheese on it too cream cheese on
[1063.80 - 1068.12] her wheat bagel she's not having
[1066.16 - 1069.76] autoimmune wait a minute if it's an
[1068.12 - 1073.16] inflammatory food how come she's not
[1069.76 - 1075.80] inflamed I want to know I want to know
[1073.16 - 1077.68] okay so you see what I'm trying to say
[1075.80 - 1079.60] and it goes on and on and on and on
[1077.68 - 1080.88] that's no joke I know lots of people
[1079.60 - 1082.36] that could eat what they want they could
[1080.88 - 1084.48] have pizza it's no big deal they could
[1082.36 - 1087.76] have pizza wheat and cheese lots of
[1084.48 - 1089.80] Wheat and they're not getting inflamed I
[1087.76 - 1091.16] know because I do scans I don't see any
[1089.80 - 1093.32] inflammation and they're not complaining
[1091.16 - 1095.04] of One symptom no aches and pains
[1093.32 - 1096.28] they're not complaining of you know this
[1095.04 - 1097.88] and that they're not complaining of
[1096.28 - 1100.16] fibromyalgia they're not complaining of
[1097.88 - 1102.92] anything because they're lacking one
[1100.16 - 1104.96] thing they're lacking the pathogen that
[1102.92 - 1108.44] feeds off of something that's what
[1104.96 - 1110.24] they're lacking do you see how it works
[1108.44 - 1111.92] you guys I mean seriously you guys are
[1110.24 - 1114.12] on board with me I need to know you're
[1111.92 - 1116.84] on board I need to know that you're
[1114.12 - 1118.72] you're with me here because this is how
[1116.84 - 1119.92] it works I mean do you know somebody
[1118.72 - 1121.48] that's feeling good and they could eat
[1119.92 - 1123.76] they could eat a chocolate cake just
[1121.48 - 1126.76] filled with wheat and just throw some
[1123.76 - 1129.64] lard in there too throw throw also MSG
[1126.76 - 1131.80] in there too whatever you know throw
[1129.64 - 1133.76] anything you want in there that fondant
[1131.80 - 1135.44] that's on chocolate cake just filled
[1133.76 - 1137.16] with God knows what weak gluten it's
[1135.44 - 1141.44] 100% weak gluten or whatever it is with
[1137.16 - 1144.72] sugar pasted in it so you know and um
[1141.44 - 1147.32] and that's how that's what I'm talking
[1144.72 - 1150.44] about and it's like uh you know and so
[1147.32 - 1152.68] here's the deal the deal is it's not the
[1150.44 - 1153.76] wheat I'm not saying the wheat's good
[1152.68 - 1155.24] and I'm going to cover that I'm going to
[1153.76 - 1156.84] cover that and talk about what grains to
[1155.24 - 1158.92] avoid what grains you know if you do
[1156.84 - 1161.12] like you can have some I'm going to talk
[1158.92 - 1163.48] about that so don't get me wrong I'm not
[1161.12 - 1165.64] the pro weak guy I'm not the pro weat
[1163.48 - 1168.36] guy I don't want anybody eating wheat
[1165.64 - 1171.88] I'm just telling you it's not what
[1168.36 - 1174.60] causes the inflammation those books are
[1171.88 - 1177.56] outdated I want them updated that's why
[1174.60 - 1179.76] I'm complaining I want them updated
[1177.56 - 1181.52] that's what I want the reason why is
[1179.76 - 1183.44] because like I said before we got the
[1181.52 - 1185.88] internet now but there's still the wrong
[1183.44 - 1187.00] information out there we got communities
[1185.88 - 1188.96] but they're dealing with the wrong
[1187.00 - 1190.36] information and people are still sick
[1188.96 - 1192.28] staying sick and getting sicker and
[1190.36 - 1194.68] sicker and sicker and like I said at one
[1192.28 - 1197.24] show it's an epidemic but it's an epic
[1194.68 - 1199.20] demic it's an epidemic and that's what
[1197.24 - 1200.68] we're dealing with all all around you
[1199.20 - 1204.20] guys that's what we're dealing with you
[1200.68 - 1206.20] know you know you see it so so here's
[1204.20 - 1208.08] the deal let's let's talk about grains
[1206.20 - 1209.44] for a little bit let's go back down into
[1208.08 - 1211.24] history a little bit too which is kind
[1209.44 - 1215.16] of funny back in
[1211.24 - 1217.88] the80s the the deal was sprouted wheat
[1215.16 - 1219.40] if you were eating sprouted wheat H you
[1217.88 - 1221.88] were you were eating you were eating
[1219.40 - 1223.92] healthy so it wasn't it was just
[1221.88 - 1226.44] sprouted wheat was the deal you go into
[1223.92 - 1228.36] the health food store and yeah you can
[1226.44 - 1230.96] pull a loaf of sprouted wheat out off
[1228.36 - 1233.60] the off out of the freezer or maybe even
[1230.96 - 1235.40] freshly made you can you know get a loaf
[1233.60 - 1238.00] of sprouted wheat and that was a big
[1235.40 - 1240.92] deal that was a big deal it was in the
[1238.00 - 1242.44] 70s and 80s that was a big deal it was
[1240.92 - 1245.52] that sprouted wheat
[1242.44 - 1246.80] bread and um and you know now you go
[1245.52 - 1248.52] into the store and there's just
[1246.80 - 1250.40] gluten-free this gluten-free that that
[1248.52 - 1251.96] you got everything this everything rice
[1250.40 - 1255.08] you got you know different things you
[1251.96 - 1257.84] got Millet bread um you know the whole
[1255.08 - 1260.40] bit and you know it's a different you
[1257.84 - 1262.12] got quinoa pasta whatever you know and
[1260.40 - 1263.28] then you got corn you got all this corn
[1262.12 - 1266.08] stuff as well and we're going to talk
[1263.28 - 1268.84] about that too because corn is corn is a
[1266.08 - 1270.96] grain as well corn is a grain as well so
[1268.84 - 1274.20] you know people think it's a vegetable
[1270.96 - 1275.36] um so we're going to we got to fix that
[1274.20 - 1277.32] you know I heard somebody tell me
[1275.36 - 1279.64] recently no Corn's a vegetable I'm like
[1277.32 - 1281.48] no no no Corn's a grain and they're like
[1279.64 - 1284.88] no it can't be I don't no I promise you
[1281.48 - 1286.36] it's a grain and so that's you know
[1284.88 - 1288.72] that's another thing to talk about we're
[1286.36 - 1290.48] going to but back then all you had was
[1288.72 - 1294.20] that sprouted wheat bread now we got
[1290.48 - 1295.60] better options we got better grains too
[1294.20 - 1297.16] you know singled out if you want to you
[1295.60 - 1298.48] know get yourself some like organic
[1297.16 - 1300.52] Millet you want to get yourself some
[1298.48 - 1302.80] quinoa so we got different grains and
[1300.52 - 1306.12] everything but back to the autoimmune
[1302.80 - 1311.08] thing the great maake autoimmune just
[1306.12 - 1314.12] back to that so if we eat something that
[1311.08 - 1316.24] feeds a condition you know a pathogen
[1314.12 - 1318.48] that's in us we get
[1316.24 - 1320.04] inflammation I've been telling people
[1318.48 - 1322.60] for years you eat eggs you're going to
[1320.04 - 1325.20] get more Hashimoto because the obsin bar
[1322.60 - 1327.24] and the thyroid that causes hasim Hashi
[1325.20 - 1330.72] sorry Hashimoto thyroiditis the Epstein
[1327.24 - 1333.64] bar in the thyroid that feeds off of
[1330.72 - 1335.44] eggs so it eats the eggs and then it you
[1333.64 - 1337.56] know and then it grows nodul you grow
[1335.44 - 1339.64] nodules in your thyroid it creates cyst
[1337.56 - 1341.68] in your thyroid it can create thyroid
[1339.64 - 1343.56] cancer the Epstein bar can even create
[1341.68 - 1345.48] thyroid cancer I'm the one who brought
[1343.56 - 1348.24] the fact that thyroid cancer is caused
[1345.48 - 1350.04] by Epstein bar um that's that
[1348.24 - 1353.48] information Spirit and I brought to town
[1350.04 - 1355.60] too and and also breast cancer is caused
[1353.48 - 1357.00] by Epstein bar as well and guess what
[1355.60 - 1358.56] now they're starting to finally bring it
[1357.00 - 1360.04] out medical research and medical science
[1358.56 - 1363.36] is talking about it for the first time
[1360.04 - 1365.80] in history um um I've been talking about
[1363.36 - 1368.40] Epstein bar um creating breast cancer
[1365.80 - 1371.56] for over 30 years so anyway the bottom
[1368.40 - 1373.40] line is is that you know these pathogens
[1371.56 - 1376.20] they feed off of the eggs they feed off
[1373.40 - 1378.72] of the wheat when it comes down to the
[1376.20 - 1382.44] grains it feeds off the
[1378.72 - 1385.24] corn that's what happens there so these
[1382.44 - 1388.24] grains certain grains can feed a
[1385.24 - 1390.36] pathogen and that's why it's all these
[1388.24 - 1392.68] diet gluten-free diet books they're like
[1390.36 - 1394.88] oh the autoimmune diet oh this
[1392.68 - 1397.72] autoimmune you know no
[1394.88 - 1400.16] actually it's really should be kind of
[1397.72 - 1402.96] redone and refixed because the stuff is
[1400.16 - 1405.76] outdated it's a pathogen feeding off of
[1402.96 - 1409.08] the wheat this is why someone can eat
[1405.76 - 1412.68] cupcakes every morning you know for like
[1409.08 - 1416.16] 50 years and not have a problem I've
[1412.68 - 1418.40] seen this over and over again but times
[1416.16 - 1421.56] are changing times are changing and
[1418.40 - 1424.20] there's less people pathogen free
[1421.56 - 1428.20] there's less people free of of viruses
[1424.20 - 1430.92] less people free of bacteria you guys
[1428.20 - 1432.56] and the less people there are that means
[1430.92 - 1434.80] we're you know we're we're seeing
[1432.56 - 1437.12] dinosaurs now people were you know
[1434.80 - 1439.32] dinosaurs where you know they're they're
[1437.12 - 1441.68] the last of the the breed that can eat
[1439.32 - 1443.08] what they want and not have a problem
[1441.68 - 1444.52] and then there's some rare young you
[1443.08 - 1446.88] know young ones that are rare and they
[1444.52 - 1449.36] can do it too right now but it's
[1446.88 - 1451.80] becoming less and less and less because
[1449.36 - 1454.40] we got people filled with more radiation
[1451.80 - 1457.08] more toxic heavy metals plot lots of
[1454.40 - 1460.48] pathogens you know utilizing it all and
[1457.08 - 1462.08] then utilizing the Grain and this is why
[1460.48 - 1466.72] grain doesn't
[1462.08 - 1469.24] work so what grains are good what grains
[1466.72 - 1471.04] are bad first of all if you're dealing
[1469.24 - 1473.28] with any condition or any symptom you
[1471.04 - 1476.16] want to keep wheat out chances are the
[1473.28 - 1479.36] wheat's feeding something and when it's
[1476.16 - 1482.12] feeding something that something is
[1479.36 - 1484.60] creating a problem whatever that could
[1482.12 - 1488.24] be when it's strep
[1484.60 - 1492.60] related so that strep strepa cacus
[1488.24 - 1495.04] feeding off of grain causing more sinus
[1492.60 - 1497.48] problems more sinus congestion it's
[1495.04 - 1499.04] strep Aus that causes all the UTI by the
[1497.48 - 1501.44] way it's it's not yeast it's strep yeast
[1499.04 - 1504.08] is just always around when you have a
[1501.44 - 1505.20] bacteria that's causing the real problem
[1504.08 - 1506.76] so when you think you have a yeast
[1505.20 - 1508.60] infection it's a UTI it's actually a
[1506.76 - 1510.68] strepa cacus infection with yeast being
[1508.60 - 1512.12] present and they look for the yeast they
[1510.68 - 1513.56] don't look for the strepa cacus just so
[1512.12 - 1516.32] you know it's rare they even bother to
[1513.56 - 1517.40] look for it so you get told you got a
[1516.32 - 1519.80] yeast
[1517.40 - 1521.40] infection and um and then when you get
[1519.80 - 1522.60] you know if you get a UTI that gets so
[1521.40 - 1524.16] bad where it gets to the kidneys and
[1522.60 - 1526.68] there's bleeding then they finally say
[1524.16 - 1528.76] oh yeah it's bacteria let's do lots of
[1526.68 - 1530.20] antibiotics you know they just forget
[1528.76 - 1531.88] the yeast tag they just don't use the
[1530.20 - 1534.00] yeast tag anymore but it's always been
[1531.88 - 1537.80] strepa cacus that's how it's always with
[1534.00 - 1539.48] always has been with UT so when you're
[1537.80 - 1541.84] dealing with grains like wheat you could
[1539.48 - 1544.40] be feeding a condition can be feeding
[1541.84 - 1548.08] strep it could be feeding you
[1544.40 - 1549.56] coli you could be feeding um some SE
[1548.08 - 1551.72] diff that's in your system that's been
[1549.56 - 1553.56] sitting around slightly dormant for
[1551.72 - 1555.92] years and years and years you could be
[1553.56 - 1557.96] feeding um the viruses all the different
[1555.92 - 1560.36] viruses there are if you're dealing with
[1557.96 - 1561.84] a retrovirus you know like HIV you're
[1560.36 - 1564.64] dealing with a retrovirus you don't want
[1561.84 - 1565.40] to feed it grains so that's another
[1564.64 - 1567.36] thing
[1565.40 - 1569.00] too if you're dealing with stealth
[1567.36 - 1572.12] viruses you don't want to feed them
[1569.00 - 1575.00] grains um if you're dealing with the flu
[1572.12 - 1577.52] you don't want to have a grain well a
[1575.00 - 1578.96] grain like wheat you don't want to like
[1577.52 - 1581.80] a grain like
[1578.96 - 1583.04] corn so those are two that you really
[1581.80 - 1586.40] don't want to
[1583.04 - 1587.96] use um and and we want to be careful we
[1586.40 - 1590.04] want to be careful so these SE are some
[1587.96 - 1594.08] of the things to think about of how it
[1590.04 - 1595.76] works um and and let's go into a couple
[1594.08 - 1597.56] different things while we have time
[1595.76 - 1600.40] about grains I don't want to leave you
[1597.56 - 1603.40] guys hanging without covering like info
[1600.40 - 1607.84] about them are there good
[1603.40 - 1610.44] grains yes there are um quinoa is a good
[1607.84 - 1612.56] grain um people are convinced it's not a
[1610.44 - 1614.88] grain I think
[1612.56 - 1617.80] psychologically it was a really good
[1614.88 - 1620.08] twist but it's a grain just so you you
[1617.80 - 1621.72] know people are convinced it's not a
[1620.08 - 1624.72] grain people are convinced it's just a
[1621.72 - 1628.40] seed that's incorrect I'm going to tell
[1624.72 - 1631.32] you that right now it's a grain but the
[1628.40 - 1634.52] technique of calling it a seed has upped
[1631.32 - 1637.08] its value tremendously by taking it out
[1634.52 - 1640.00] of the grain world it's a bril it was
[1637.08 - 1642.80] brilliant it was absolutely brilliant
[1640.00 - 1644.84] because it it really did Elevate Quin
[1642.80 - 1647.72] elevated out of it it said no you're the
[1644.84 - 1651.48] Jesus Christ of of the grains you're not
[1647.72 - 1655.40] a grain and it elevated it up but it's a
[1651.48 - 1658.80] grain sorry about that it is so so the
[1655.40 - 1661.60] deal is is quinoa is a good one now if
[1658.80 - 1665.08] you're you know into like um if you're
[1661.60 - 1666.88] into like uh no car and autoimmune is
[1665.08 - 1669.04] caused by grains you're you're not going
[1666.88 - 1672.64] to be offered quinoa most
[1669.04 - 1674.24] likely um but it's actually okay now if
[1672.64 - 1675.92] you're somebody you're dealing with a
[1674.24 - 1677.64] lot of different symptoms and a lot of
[1675.92 - 1679.56] different varieties of symptoms you've
[1677.64 - 1681.68] been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
[1679.56 - 1683.88] it could be anything Hashimoto could be
[1681.68 - 1687.36] anything lupus um and you know
[1683.88 - 1691.16] Scleroderma to um you know anything
[1687.36 - 1692.88] sarcoidosis to um you know spino litis
[1691.16 - 1695.80] whatever it is that you're dealing with
[1692.88 - 1699.72] all these different things ecomori to
[1695.80 - 1702.36] different problems ra um chronic fatigue
[1699.72 - 1704.88] then it's a good idea to keep even the
[1702.36 - 1707.32] good grains out even the good grains out
[1704.88 - 1709.56] but your heart set on it your heart set
[1707.32 - 1711.32] on on it you really want the grain then
[1709.56 - 1715.44] you want to be thinking about quinoa
[1711.32 - 1716.92] it's one of the best ones if you um if
[1715.44 - 1718.92] you know if you're not dealing with a
[1716.92 - 1721.16] lot but you enjoy grains you can go with
[1718.92 - 1724.28] quinoa let's talk about another one too
[1721.16 - 1726.32] uh Millet Millet is a good one now the
[1724.28 - 1727.56] problem is with grains now too is that
[1726.32 - 1729.52] they're changing a little bit there's a
[1727.56 - 1732.68] lot of GMO grains on the market they're
[1729.52 - 1734.80] moving in that kind of ruined it in so
[1732.68 - 1737.08] many ways like wheat's changed wheat's
[1734.80 - 1738.72] been hybridized so many times that's one
[1737.08 - 1741.36] way that that's kind of gotten it a
[1738.72 - 1743.72] little messed up um the old days it was
[1741.36 - 1745.20] hybridized and and hybridization is not
[1743.72 - 1748.12] a bad thing but when it comes down to
[1745.20 - 1752.00] when its grains it's not helpful at all
[1748.12 - 1754.16] and um so Millet is something that's a
[1752.00 - 1755.80] good grain too you can get Millet bread
[1754.16 - 1757.48] but Millet bread usually comes with all
[1755.80 - 1760.28] this other stuff so you're better off
[1757.48 - 1762.00] just cooking up Millet on its own Millet
[1760.28 - 1765.12] by itself is really nutritious it's a
[1762.00 - 1766.24] gluten-free grain quinoa is gluten-free
[1765.12 - 1769.60] and it's a really these are two
[1766.24 - 1771.80] nutritious grains so it I learned this
[1769.60 - 1775.20] too you know it's food is really
[1771.80 - 1778.16] expensive really expensive I mean it it
[1775.20 - 1780.76] it takes a whole paycheck to shop
[1778.16 - 1783.28] nowadays um you're buying fruit you're
[1780.76 - 1785.76] buying vegetables people don't buy a lot
[1783.28 - 1787.16] of fruit really anyway you know so which
[1785.76 - 1788.80] has to change in the world we got to get
[1787.16 - 1790.92] people eating more fruit for their
[1788.80 - 1793.44] longevity but you know people buy
[1790.92 - 1795.60] vegetables people buy you know proteins
[1793.44 - 1798.00] people you know and it's expensive and
[1795.60 - 1799.48] it adds up really fast you know and I
[1798.00 - 1801.12] have people that are on budgets I know
[1799.48 - 1803.76] people that are on budgets they go go
[1801.12 - 1806.76] look I only can have I only have $50
[1803.76 - 1810.32] this week and what do I do you know only
[1806.76 - 1813.00] have $25 this week what do I do and if I
[1810.32 - 1814.68] think they're not so bad off with
[1813.00 - 1816.04] different conditions and pathogens and
[1814.68 - 1818.84] everything else if I think they're not
[1816.04 - 1821.04] so bad off with all of that I'll say
[1818.84 - 1822.28] look why don't you get some Millet why
[1821.04 - 1824.56] don't you get some Miller it's really
[1822.28 - 1827.68] cheap really inexpensive you can cook a
[1824.56 - 1828.64] huge pot of it it's not going to feed
[1827.68 - 1831.32] your
[1828.64 - 1832.88] pathogens because you know Epstein bar
[1831.32 - 1834.52] really doesn't feed off of millet it
[1832.88 - 1836.16] really doesn't you know there's
[1834.52 - 1838.80] pathogens that won't feed off of it it's
[1836.16 - 1840.68] not the it's not great for anybody to be
[1838.80 - 1842.92] on lots of grain or grain if they have a
[1840.68 - 1845.40] lot of conditions because something
[1842.92 - 1846.92] could potentially feed off of it but
[1845.40 - 1849.88] Millet is one of those foods that
[1846.92 - 1852.40] doesn't really do that so much so I'll
[1849.88 - 1855.40] say to somebody who's only got $25 a
[1852.40 - 1858.36] week uh which I totally get I totally
[1855.40 - 1860.24] understand and it's like here you know
[1858.36 - 1862.92] get a pot of millet cook that pot of
[1860.24 - 1864.12] millet once a day and in the end that
[1862.92 - 1865.28] pot of millet is going to cost you you
[1864.12 - 1867.64] know every time you have a bowl of M
[1865.28 - 1868.80] it's going to be 10 cents 15 cents I
[1867.64 - 1872.52] don't know what it is something like
[1868.80 - 1874.48] that and that's one option and the same
[1872.52 - 1877.72] thing with with quinoa you can get
[1874.48 - 1882.48] quinoa it Cooks up it's light and fluffy
[1877.72 - 1884.56] you can get away with it um oatmeal
[1882.48 - 1886.24] that's one right there oatmeal
[1884.56 - 1887.96] gluten-free oatmeal why do we say that
[1886.24 - 1889.76] cuz it's always process in factories
[1887.96 - 1891.16] with gluten it's always processed in
[1889.76 - 1892.84] factories with gluten and wheat and
[1891.16 - 1894.48] everything else so you want to make sure
[1892.84 - 1896.52] it's gluten-free so there's not gluten
[1894.48 - 1899.00] if you're worried about gluten but
[1896.52 - 1901.60] oatmeal still cut of Oats that works for
[1899.00 - 1903.60] some people but listen listen understand
[1901.60 - 1905.92] this some people they just don't do good
[1903.60 - 1908.52] with grains but some people don't do
[1905.92 - 1910.72] good with meat some people don't do good
[1908.52 - 1912.88] with chicken some people don't do good
[1910.72 - 1915.52] with you know fruit they say some people
[1912.88 - 1918.76] don't do good with vegetables at all
[1915.52 - 1920.24] some people can't eat a salad salad um I
[1918.76 - 1922.72] have people who can't eat a salad but
[1920.24 - 1926.12] they can eat oatmeal I have people that
[1922.72 - 1927.72] can eat you seriously I got people that
[1926.12 - 1929.76] all they could do is you know eat
[1927.72 - 1932.24] chicken and they can't eat one
[1929.76 - 1934.84] vegetable um you know I got people that
[1932.24 - 1936.36] you know can only eat fruit it's the
[1934.84 - 1938.72] only thing that feels good in their
[1936.36 - 1940.24] stomach and they can't eat you know a
[1938.72 - 1942.28] vegetable I got people that can only eat
[1940.24 - 1945.72] fruit and can't eat meat I got people
[1942.28 - 1948.08] that only you know can eat meat and and
[1945.72 - 1950.16] like one vegetable so it's it's you know
[1948.08 - 1952.76] it's it's kind of like that you got to
[1950.16 - 1956.84] see where you're at but
[1952.76 - 1959.60] oatmeal won't necessarily feed a bad
[1956.84 - 1963.60] pathogen so if you need to use it or can
[1959.60 - 1966.88] use it you can if you can you can um
[1963.60 - 1968.96] Millet won't necessarily feed a pathogen
[1966.88 - 1971.76] if you need it you can use it I like
[1968.96 - 1974.48] Millet better uh than oatmeal I like
[1971.76 - 1977.40] quinoa better than oatmeal and like I
[1974.48 - 1979.12] said affordability it's pretty cool
[1977.40 - 1980.64] definitely don't do Sprout at wheat it's
[1979.12 - 1982.04] not it's a waste of your time it's a
[1980.64 - 1985.84] sprout at wheat it's totally a waste of
[1982.04 - 1987.84] your time um and stay away from wheat
[1985.84 - 1989.56] completely if you're dealing with any
[1987.84 - 1992.00] symptom or condition and if you don't
[1989.56 - 1994.40] even have a symptom or condition I still
[1992.00 - 1996.40] just don't even like wheat um cuz the
[1994.40 - 1997.96] potential is there the potential is
[1996.40 - 2000.76] there for something the potential is
[1997.96 - 2005.52] there let's talk about rice arsenic are
[2000.76 - 2008.32] no arsenic is arsenic in rice okay this
[2005.52 - 2012.00] is this is going to blow your mind
[2008.32 - 2014.92] is there arsenic and rice no there isn't
[2012.00 - 2016.28] there isn't yeah do you have Stones
[2014.92 - 2019.72] ready cuz you're going to have to Stone
[2016.28 - 2022.44] me to death over here because there I'm
[2019.72 - 2024.56] I'm going to get a lot of people angry
[2022.44 - 2028.88] okay this was a
[2024.56 - 2033.56] misconception there is arsenic in one
[2028.88 - 2035.84] variety of stripped white rice okay one
[2033.56 - 2037.80] variety of stripped white rice out there
[2035.84 - 2040.24] there's some arsenic in there due to the
[2037.80 - 2042.40] pesticides but those arsenic pesticides
[2040.24 - 2046.28] are on
[2042.40 - 2048.08] everything everything they on everything
[2046.28 - 2049.84] and that's where it came from I mean
[2048.08 - 2052.68] that's where where it's happening it's
[2049.84 - 2055.28] everywhere it's copper and Arsenic and
[2052.68 - 2058.04] it's on conventional stuff I mean if
[2055.28 - 2060.20] you're really really in a financial
[2058.04 - 2062.36] problem and you can't eat one thing
[2060.20 - 2065.08] organic then we yes we do conventional
[2062.36 - 2067.40] fruits and vegetables without a doubt
[2065.08 - 2069.56] but the Arsenic is on
[2067.40 - 2071.72] every it's in every pesticide it's
[2069.56 - 2076.00] ladled everywhere it's it's on
[2071.72 - 2080.20] everything so you get organic
[2076.00 - 2082.44] rice and you pick organic brown rice the
[2080.20 - 2085.92] safest and the best is organic short
[2082.44 - 2088.92] grain brown rice organic short grain
[2085.92 - 2090.44] brown rice okay that's the safest
[2088.92 - 2093.72] there's no arsenic on it there's no
[2090.44 - 2095.88] arsenic in it it's not it's not there
[2093.72 - 2097.92] because arsenic comes from those heavy
[2095.88 - 2098.96] laden pesticides sides especially in
[2097.92 - 2101.60] other countries where they're still
[2098.96 - 2103.04] using DDT everything else that's where
[2101.60 - 2105.48] that arsenic is I'm just telling you
[2103.04 - 2109.16] right now this was another Mass
[2105.48 - 2111.96] confusion don't be afraid of rice um
[2109.16 - 2114.96] rice is gluten-free can totally do rice
[2111.96 - 2117.00] if you really like it um absolutely had
[2114.96 - 2118.76] someone tell me hey look you know I ate
[2117.00 - 2121.04] rice all these years I heard it's bad
[2118.76 - 2124.72] for you now I heard it causes autoimmune
[2121.04 - 2127.40] no rice doesn't cause autoimmune rice if
[2124.72 - 2130.44] you eat a lot of it it could
[2127.40 - 2131.64] potentially instigate a pathogen but if
[2130.44 - 2133.20] you're feeling healthy enough you're
[2131.64 - 2134.68] feeling stable enough you don't have a
[2133.20 - 2136.44] lot of symptoms you don't have a lot of
[2134.68 - 2138.36] conditions you don't have a lot of money
[2136.44 - 2139.88] you want to have a pot of brown rice you
[2138.36 - 2141.76] have a pot of brown rice if you really
[2139.88 - 2144.48] want have it with
[2141.76 - 2146.48] vegetables you see how it works it's not
[2144.48 - 2148.40] about what Anthony's belief system is
[2146.48 - 2150.00] like does Anthony you know believe in
[2148.40 - 2153.08] this and this only or does Anthony
[2150.00 - 2155.40] believe in that sounds silly but it's
[2153.08 - 2156.88] not about that it's about what's right
[2155.40 - 2158.44] it's about what works about what's
[2156.88 - 2159.96] really wrong with someone's Health it's
[2158.44 - 2161.80] about the right information if you
[2159.96 - 2163.64] logged on to this show you're going to
[2161.80 - 2166.04] get the right information you're going
[2163.64 - 2168.20] to get why autoimmune is called called
[2166.04 - 2171.48] Auto autoimmune and how the blame was
[2168.20 - 2173.76] put on us you're going to get why you
[2171.48 - 2176.84] know we're told their body's attacking
[2173.76 - 2178.80] itself you're going to get why we get
[2176.84 - 2181.68] sick you're going to get what's really
[2178.80 - 2183.64] causing the sicknesses oh it's not the
[2181.68 - 2185.36] grain you're also going to get a guy
[2183.64 - 2187.80] that says which is me don't eat the
[2185.36 - 2189.92] grain don't eat wheat don't eat corn
[2187.80 - 2191.60] they'll feed the pathogens so it's not
[2189.92 - 2193.52] like I'm sitting here saying oh you can
[2191.60 - 2195.04] eat all the grain you want oh forget
[2193.52 - 2197.00] autoimmune that's not what I'm talking
[2195.04 - 2198.44] about you guys are listening so if you
[2197.00 - 2199.48] just logged on to the show go back to
[2198.44 - 2202.16] the beginning and you're going to have
[2199.48 - 2205.84] to hear the beginning of the show
[2202.16 - 2207.48] so how can grains work better for us if
[2205.84 - 2209.44] we're going to eat them if you're going
[2207.48 - 2211.88] to choose to eat them I mean me
[2209.44 - 2213.84] personally I like eating some fruit
[2211.88 - 2215.68] because I want the longevity I want the
[2213.84 - 2218.08] antioxidants I want the
[2215.68 - 2221.24] phytochemicals um I want the asparagus I
[2218.08 - 2222.80] want the spinach I want the papaya you
[2221.24 - 2225.12] know I like those because of what they
[2222.80 - 2226.64] offer I talked about the raw honey I
[2225.12 - 2229.40] like the raw honey I know I get the
[2226.64 - 2231.16] vegans so upset I understand I get the
[2229.40 - 2232.24] plant-based people so upset with the
[2231.16 - 2234.40] honey but we're going to do a show and
[2232.24 - 2236.80] I'm going to talk about how honey really
[2234.40 - 2238.72] is vegan by the way so this a whole
[2236.80 - 2240.96] another misconception I have to help
[2238.72 - 2243.36] everybody out with it's so important to
[2240.96 - 2246.24] know this the vegans need to know this
[2243.36 - 2248.68] that honey is okay to eat now I really
[2246.24 - 2250.96] got everybody mad but here's the deal
[2248.68 - 2253.00] here's the deal um it's all about
[2250.96 - 2255.64] phytochemicals what has the most
[2253.00 - 2257.80] medicine what can help and heal our
[2255.64 - 2260.32] diseases and our conditions what can
[2257.80 - 2262.16] protect us from cancer is why I did
[2260.32 - 2264.80] lifechanging Foods book if you haven't
[2262.16 - 2266.88] ordered a copy yet just don't forget
[2264.80 - 2268.56] because it's it's my greatest prayers
[2266.88 - 2270.32] and wishes that people actually have
[2268.56 - 2271.64] that information and I want people to
[2270.32 - 2273.96] heal and then you could help other
[2271.64 - 2275.96] people heal and other people heal and
[2273.96 - 2277.44] that's what it's about so you know it's
[2275.96 - 2280.12] about this fight of chemicals it's about
[2277.44 - 2282.60] the antioxidants it's about all of that
[2280.12 - 2285.12] information it's not about what I like
[2282.60 - 2286.64] what I don't like and so that's very
[2285.12 - 2289.72] important it's not what about a belief
[2286.64 - 2293.44] system I subscribe to it's about just
[2289.72 - 2297.56] making sure you guys get what you need
[2293.44 - 2300.04] celery works great with with uh grains
[2297.56 - 2302.24] it works incredible you can you can cook
[2300.04 - 2305.00] celery steam it chop it up have it in a
[2302.24 - 2309.24] grain dish if you want you can have it
[2305.00 - 2312.68] raw chopped up raw and put in a quinoa
[2309.24 - 2314.68] dish celery is amazing you can for that
[2312.68 - 2317.36] it's incredible for that really healing
[2314.68 - 2319.40] really profoundly powerful when you put
[2317.36 - 2322.76] it with a grain meaning that what celery
[2319.40 - 2326.24] does is celery makes the grain work it
[2322.76 - 2329.00] makes the grain um
[2326.24 - 2331.16] eliminate its potential of
[2329.00 - 2334.16] phytochemicals because grains have
[2331.16 - 2336.48] medicine in them too so what happens is
[2334.16 - 2337.84] when you have celery with with quinoa if
[2336.48 - 2340.88] if you have celery with a little brown
[2337.84 - 2343.32] rice if that's something you want if you
[2340.88 - 2345.68] have that the celery the mineral salts
[2343.32 - 2348.08] in the celery the the rare mineral salts
[2345.68 - 2351.76] that are are not measured by science and
[2348.08 - 2354.40] research turn the grain into something
[2351.76 - 2357.72] that's what happens it Cates the grain
[2354.40 - 2360.60] it Cates what is good the phytochemical
[2357.72 - 2362.24] in the grain could have that with quinoa
[2360.60 - 2365.40] you can have celery with any grain you
[2362.24 - 2367.08] choose cucumbers chop up cucumbers have
[2365.40 - 2369.76] that with a quinoa dish have that with a
[2367.08 - 2372.40] millet dish have that with a rice dish
[2369.76 - 2375.56] incredible cucumbers help as well they
[2372.40 - 2378.80] help balance the acidity of grains cuz
[2375.56 - 2381.08] grains are really acidic they're really
[2378.80 - 2384.08] acidic so they help so you know the
[2381.08 - 2386.44] Cucumber helps balance that acidity with
[2384.08 - 2389.36] the grain
[2386.44 - 2391.00] spinach spinach is incredible it
[2389.36 - 2394.84] actually helps the body break down
[2391.00 - 2397.12] digest and use the amino acids correctly
[2394.84 - 2398.80] from the grains
[2397.12 - 2399.96] one of the things is Arginine you know
[2398.80 - 2401.64] that's one of the amino acids
[2399.96 - 2405.24] everybody's worried about when it comes
[2401.64 - 2407.88] down to grains carnitine is the amino
[2405.24 - 2410.12] acid we have to worry about carnitine
[2407.88 - 2413.16] don't take carnitine supplements if you
[2410.12 - 2416.92] have a condition it'll blow it up it'll
[2413.16 - 2419.56] blow that condition out of the water for
[2416.92 - 2422.16] you in a bad way so don't you know
[2419.56 - 2425.24] carnitine that's the one that's
[2422.16 - 2428.40] Troublesome it ignites viruses it
[2425.24 - 2430.08] ignites everything Under the Sun arine
[2428.40 - 2434.92] is like a
[2430.08 - 2438.68] firecracker to carnitine which is like a
[2434.92 - 2442.56] bomb okay I'm just telling you right now
[2438.68 - 2445.20] so you know um spinach helps knock down
[2442.56 - 2447.56] Arginine uh actually celery does too
[2445.20 - 2450.84] both those knock down Arginine levels if
[2447.56 - 2454.72] there if a grain has any of that in
[2450.84 - 2458.08] there um lettuce lettuce is really work
[2454.72 - 2460.48] good with grains rice can go in lettuce
[2458.08 - 2463.52] um lettuce wraps you can take Roma leaf
[2460.48 - 2465.72] lettuce we could put rice in there and
[2463.52 - 2467.20] um this is if your you're you dig grains
[2465.72 - 2469.80] you know like I did have a few people
[2467.20 - 2471.36] tell me look I love grains ate them my
[2469.80 - 2473.36] whole life the whole world's against
[2471.36 - 2475.12] them what do I do I'm like look as long
[2473.36 - 2476.68] as you're feeling this and feeling that
[2475.12 - 2479.08] and guidelines and everything else that
[2476.68 - 2481.44] I'm talking about on the show then fine
[2479.08 - 2482.80] um Water Crest it's a great one with
[2481.44 - 2486.80] grains
[2482.80 - 2490.80] arugula that's a good one mhm
[2486.80 - 2495.20] sipping a little water here arugula
[2490.80 - 2496.88] that's a great one arugula is like a a
[2495.20 - 2499.84] tonic for the
[2496.88 - 2502.28] stomach arugula helps with hydrochloric
[2499.84 - 2505.24] acid as well those rare seven the seven
[2502.28 - 2507.00] hydrochloric acid blend and arugula
[2505.24 - 2508.56] helps stimulate that and create a little
[2507.00 - 2512.08] bit more hydrochloric acid a little a
[2508.56 - 2513.80] lot different than celery celer you know
[2512.08 - 2515.68] basically helps build the strength of
[2513.80 - 2516.96] your hydrochloric acid helps build the
[2515.68 - 2520.08] strength the
[2516.96 - 2523.00] sorry arugula tongue Tiding me there
[2520.08 - 2524.60] arugula does more than that in a
[2523.00 - 2528.08] different way it takes the the
[2524.60 - 2532.00] hydrochloric acid that you have and it
[2528.08 - 2533.92] strengthens it celery produces it get it
[2532.00 - 2536.64] actually allows a production of
[2533.92 - 2539.16] hydrochloric acid helps you know build
[2536.64 - 2542.28] that hydrochloric acid up levels of it
[2539.16 - 2544.84] up aruga you know amplifies it in a
[2542.28 - 2546.76] different way that was a little
[2544.84 - 2548.52] confusing but that's what ites does it
[2546.76 - 2550.08] they both work together and it's
[2548.52 - 2551.88] something to have in your diet one way
[2550.08 - 2554.64] or another but it works great with
[2551.88 - 2557.16] grains Sprouts micro grains help
[2554.64 - 2559.20] neutralize the acidity in grains because
[2557.16 - 2562.80] they're so alkaline that's another thing
[2559.20 - 2565.60] right there parsley amazing with grains
[2562.80 - 2568.84] it's incredible actually very helpful
[2565.60 - 2572.36] cilantro cilantro is wonderful with
[2568.84 - 2574.76] grains if you're stuck with that one
[2572.36 - 2576.60] variety of white rice from that one
[2574.76 - 2579.36] country that's still using d te with
[2576.60 - 2582.08] tons of arsenic on it and you're stuck
[2579.36 - 2584.72] with that one you know just bottom of
[2582.08 - 2586.80] the barrel rice because you got nothing
[2584.72 - 2590.76] else to eat and I totally understand
[2586.80 - 2594.12] that then cilantro you eat cilantro with
[2590.76 - 2596.68] that that type of rice you eat cilantro
[2594.12 - 2598.04] with that variety of rice that can be
[2596.68 - 2601.64] really
[2598.04 - 2603.80] helpful um and then let's see we'll see
[2601.64 - 2606.28] what else we got cooking here Tomatoes
[2603.80 - 2608.68] it's incredible with a grain can under
[2606.28 - 2610.72] estimated at all that's another great
[2608.68 - 2612.36] one so don't be afraid of tomatoes and
[2610.72 - 2616.56] you might say hey night shades I can't
[2612.36 - 2619.76] eat tomatoes no no no you don't want
[2616.56 - 2621.84] pizza with tomato sauce that's how
[2619.76 - 2624.76] you're going to have aches and pains
[2621.84 - 2626.12] because the the the uh crust the wheat
[2624.76 - 2628.16] crust is going to feed some kind of
[2626.12 - 2630.68] pathogen the cheese is going to feed
[2628.16 - 2633.60] some kind of pathogen that's what's
[2630.68 - 2635.32] going to give you a problem when it
[2633.60 - 2637.44] comes down to you know aches and pains
[2635.32 - 2639.92] and ra and all these other issues that
[2637.44 - 2643.40] night shades caused no it's not the
[2639.92 - 2645.08] Tomato on the pizza so it's it's the
[2643.40 - 2647.76] pizza so remember that so Tomatoes
[2645.08 - 2649.92] really helpful for grains fresh tomatoes
[2647.76 - 2653.12] tomato salads tomato cucumber salads
[2649.92 - 2655.76] with some quinoa in it can't go wrong
[2653.12 - 2658.84] onions they work great with grains I'm
[2655.76 - 2661.76] not talking about Flavor I mean sure
[2658.84 - 2665.04] probably flavors it good but I'm talking
[2661.76 - 2666.60] about synergistically bio identically it
[2665.04 - 2671.40] connects to
[2666.60 - 2674.68] the grain um scallions and chives they
[2671.40 - 2676.72] work great with Millet TEF they work
[2674.68 - 2679.28] great with TEF that's another one they
[2676.72 - 2680.92] work great with amaranth you can use
[2679.28 - 2683.08] amaranth and TEF they're very good
[2680.92 - 2685.16] grains um you can definitely get into
[2683.08 - 2687.04] those if you need to Ginger it's
[2685.16 - 2689.08] incredible too it's an incredible um
[2687.04 - 2693.08] tonic for the stomach which helps you
[2689.08 - 2695.16] utilize the grain more turmeric um
[2693.08 - 2697.96] turmeric does something interesting it
[2695.16 - 2700.88] enhances enhances the good amino acids
[2697.96 - 2702.76] and Grains it enhances them pulls them
[2700.88 - 2705.28] out enhances them actually puts them as
[2702.76 - 2707.08] a star puts them up on a
[2705.28 - 2709.32] pedestal
[2707.08 - 2711.68] Rosemary I think I put that one in
[2709.32 - 2713.88] because it tastes so good with a grain
[2711.68 - 2717.36] Rosemary Rosemary does more than that
[2713.88 - 2718.84] Rose Rosemary stimulates um digestion
[2717.36 - 2720.84] strengthens digestion it's like a
[2718.84 - 2723.32] digestion Aid and when you have that
[2720.84 - 2726.64] with a grain they really work together
[2723.32 - 2728.68] good avocado goes great with grain
[2726.64 - 2730.92] because instead of using butter instead
[2728.68 - 2734.52] of using butter instead of using you
[2730.92 - 2737.00] know um cheese or some other type of fat
[2734.52 - 2739.84] um you can instead of using bad oil like
[2737.00 - 2742.72] canola oil you can use avocado with your
[2739.84 - 2743.84] Millet avocado with some rice avocado
[2742.72 - 2747.96] Azure
[2743.84 - 2749.80] butter and garlic Garlic's a great one
[2747.96 - 2753.56] because garlic the phytochemicals and
[2749.80 - 2755.36] garlic actually bind to the grain they
[2753.56 - 2757.64] become one so as they go down through
[2755.36 - 2760.44] your intestinal track they become Bug
[2757.64 - 2762.04] Killers garlic sticks to the Grain and
[2760.44 - 2764.32] it kills bugs as it goes down through
[2762.04 - 2766.24] your intestinal tract so anybody's
[2764.32 - 2767.28] worried about a worm that's a great way
[2766.24 - 2770.16] of
[2767.28 - 2773.40] deworming so these are some of the
[2770.16 - 2776.48] options that we have so here's the deal
[2773.40 - 2781.08] here's the deal if you're somebody that
[2776.48 - 2783.68] is afraid of eating fruit but you only
[2781.08 - 2786.08] eat grain try to switch it off try to
[2783.68 - 2789.12] move the grain out of your diet and eat
[2786.08 - 2790.56] more fruit there's no question um if
[2789.12 - 2792.60] you're somebody afraid of a lot of
[2790.56 - 2794.76] vegetables but you eat a lot of grain
[2792.60 - 2796.24] try to move the grain out and start
[2794.76 - 2798.04] bringing in more
[2796.24 - 2800.76] vegetables um if you're someone that
[2798.04 - 2803.28] likes a lot of fish keep the grains
[2800.76 - 2804.80] really low it don't want a lot of grains
[2803.28 - 2806.16] while you're doing a lot of fish you
[2804.80 - 2808.44] don't want too you know like a lot of
[2806.16 - 2812.08] people do fish and rice I would say
[2808.44 - 2813.56] quinoa is the safest grain with fish so
[2812.08 - 2815.64] if you like wild salmon and you want to
[2813.56 - 2816.72] do a grain or you're over somebody's
[2815.64 - 2818.32] house house that's what they're making
[2816.72 - 2820.12] whatever it is you know I mean or you're
[2818.32 - 2822.20] at a restaurant and you want to ask for
[2820.12 - 2825.16] something like that you can do like
[2822.20 - 2828.40] salmon and some kinoa but try not to do
[2825.16 - 2830.28] salmon and some a basket of bread at the
[2828.40 - 2831.92] restaurant too you know wheat bread try
[2830.28 - 2833.84] not to do wheat and salmon try not to
[2831.92 - 2837.28] have a salmon
[2833.84 - 2838.92] sandwich and um and same thing with rice
[2837.28 - 2841.44] try not do salmon and rice you try to do
[2838.92 - 2843.88] say salmon and quinoa or just salmon and
[2841.44 - 2846.16] vegetables or you know another fish that
[2843.88 - 2848.84] you like if you're a big meat eater keep
[2846.16 - 2852.52] the grains to literally a little bit of
[2848.84 - 2854.48] quinoa and maybe a little bit of of
[2852.52 - 2857.48] millet once in a while if you're doing a
[2854.48 - 2860.24] lot of meat meat doesn't go great with
[2857.48 - 2862.00] grains at all we've known this forever
[2860.24 - 2864.96] and I say we because I've seen that
[2862.00 - 2867.20] circulate among the um alternative
[2864.96 - 2869.56] communities and I agree with it since
[2867.20 - 2872.12] the beginning of its conception that the
[2869.56 - 2874.64] body has a hard time digesting digesting
[2872.12 - 2877.68] heavy amounts of protein while digesting
[2874.64 - 2880.76] a starch at the the same time if you're
[2877.68 - 2884.48] a big grass-fed beef eater keep your
[2880.76 - 2886.40] grains minimum you can do more fruit you
[2884.48 - 2888.08] can do lots of vegetables you can do
[2886.40 - 2891.24] more fruit you can do a few nuts and
[2888.08 - 2893.04] seeds but keep your grains down lower if
[2891.24 - 2894.28] you're doing animal protein once a day
[2893.04 - 2896.52] if you're a person who just likes to
[2894.28 - 2898.08] have a little bit of chicken at night or
[2896.52 - 2899.68] a little bit of turkey at night or
[2898.08 - 2903.00] something like that and you're doing
[2899.68 - 2905.28] animal protein once a day um don't do
[2903.00 - 2906.84] don't do grains more than once a day if
[2905.28 - 2909.12] you're grain eater if you really like
[2906.84 - 2911.60] grains so that's the kind of the you
[2909.12 - 2913.84] know a little bit of a systematic plan
[2911.60 - 2919.28] for you guys if you're really you know
[2913.84 - 2920.96] doing that um if you're raw vegan um
[2919.28 - 2922.92] just just stay away from grains all
[2920.96 - 2925.52] together um if you're dealing with a lot
[2922.92 - 2927.28] of illnesses or conditions stay away
[2925.52 - 2929.20] from grains altogether you know if
[2927.28 - 2930.56] you're feeling pretty good and and
[2929.20 - 2932.56] you're living your life and you want
[2930.56 - 2933.76] some Keen watch it'd be all right so
[2932.56 - 2936.28] it's kind of like that you got to play
[2933.76 - 2939.04] it by ear see where you are but but
[2936.28 - 2943.52] there's no skull and crossbones in front
[2939.04 - 2945.56] of quinoa Millet steel cut oats even
[2943.52 - 2947.28] buckwheat you know it's not buckwheat's
[2945.56 - 2948.84] not my favorite but you know meaning
[2947.28 - 2951.16] like I'm not that fond of it for a lot
[2948.84 - 2954.12] of health reasons but even buckwheat
[2951.16 - 2956.96] rice you know te amaranth there's no
[2954.12 - 2959.64] skull and crossbones in front of it okay
[2956.96 - 2963.48] they don't create autoimmune all right
[2959.64 - 2966.68] so that's how it works corn and wheat
[2963.48 - 2969.88] definitely feed bugs
[2966.68 - 2970.88] that mistaken the world as the body
[2969.88 - 2973.20] attacking
[2970.88 - 2976.20] itself okay when really it's the bug
[2973.20 - 2978.64] attacking the body by getting fueled up
[2976.20 - 2982.08] with wheat and corn so I'm trying to
[2978.64 - 2984.00] clarify that 100% so understand that
[2982.08 - 2986.84] that's important to know but there's
[2984.00 - 2989.20] still skull and crossbones in front of
[2986.84 - 2991.16] grains and um so if you need to
[2989.20 - 2992.76] incorporate them like I said some people
[2991.16 - 2995.20] they can't afford food and you can buy a
[2992.76 - 2997.48] big sack of millet and you can cook it
[2995.20 - 2999.04] each day and you could feed your family
[2997.48 - 3001.80] and you're feeding them healthy you
[2999.04 - 3004.44] really are so you got to you know there
[3001.80 - 3008.08] there's different ways of of doing
[3004.44 - 3009.92] things so anyway I hope I covered like a
[3008.08 - 3011.60] lot of grain stuff there's only a few
[3009.92 - 3014.68] minutes left so let me just cover one
[3011.60 - 3016.84] more thing mot toxins and mold and
[3014.68 - 3019.32] fungus okay that's a whole thing about
[3016.84 - 3022.04] grains so it's mot toxin that whole mot
[3019.32 - 3025.68] toxin thing um it's not what people
[3022.04 - 3028.36] think microt toxins are really not the
[3025.68 - 3031.28] the the problem with the grain as far as
[3028.36 - 3034.16] with the grain microt toxins are a
[3031.28 - 3036.56] problem when we get triggered by
[3034.16 - 3039.52] inhaling breathing in or eating or
[3036.56 - 3041.60] living in mold like the dangerous molds
[3039.52 - 3043.76] the black mold I did a mold show talking
[3041.60 - 3045.84] about this and the MotoX sins are
[3043.76 - 3049.68] actually poisons that are in the mold
[3045.84 - 3052.12] that the mold produces and grain does
[3049.68 - 3055.48] collect mold and we know it's been been
[3052.12 - 3057.68] you know capable of collecting mold but
[3055.48 - 3059.92] so does everything you can get the worst
[3057.68 - 3062.16] microt toxins from meat collecting Mo
[3059.92 - 3064.68] mold you can you know anything can
[3062.16 - 3067.36] collect mold fish can collect mold meat
[3064.68 - 3068.96] can collect mold anything can collect
[3067.36 - 3071.16] mold so you have to understand that the
[3068.96 - 3073.60] microt toxins are all around everywhere
[3071.16 - 3076.92] with every food item we have on this
[3073.60 - 3078.88] planet and that's just how it works so
[3076.92 - 3080.56] you just don't want to eat moldy grains
[3078.88 - 3082.40] is what I'm trying to say so when you
[3080.56 - 3084.20] get quinoa you just make sure it's good
[3082.40 - 3085.56] stuff high quality it won't have mold in
[3084.20 - 3087.96] it so you're not going to get any MIT
[3085.56 - 3089.96] microt toxins this is another huge
[3087.96 - 3091.96] confusion out there in the alternative
[3089.96 - 3095.44] movement about microt toxins and
[3091.96 - 3098.92] everything else and but wheat and corn
[3095.44 - 3100.32] feed viruses that create neurotoxins and
[3098.92 - 3102.80] those are the ones that make us
[3100.32 - 3104.64] neurologically sick not mot toxins I'm
[3102.80 - 3106.48] not saying mot toxins are good cuz mold
[3104.64 - 3108.60] isn't it does knock us down so that
[3106.48 - 3111.72] Epstein bar can take over and other
[3108.60 - 3113.72] things can take over so and we'll do
[3111.72 - 3115.64] another mot toxin show too to really
[3113.72 - 3119.52] clarify that as well so we know what's
[3115.64 - 3121.56] going on look you guys um check out the
