00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,880
to heal Anthony William is the medical

[Music]

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,400
medium hello I'm Anthony William the

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,720
medical Medium you're listening to the

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
medical medium radio show where each

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,800
week I bring the most advanced

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,199
information on health out there often

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
ahead of what's out there now and I'm

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,000
talking about conventional medicine too

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,800
and alternative medicine research and

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,079
science doesn't know a heck of a lot

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,440
about guess what chronic illness don't

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,760
get that confused with you know with

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
other life-saving medicine and

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,719
everything else that's involved in

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,039
technology that's different this is why

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,600
I often hear all the time young people

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,840
who have been taught and conditioned

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,480
that technology and science and research

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,719
has it all down with everything in life

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,519
they feel this safety they feel this

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,960
this control and all of it and all of a

25
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,800
sudden the the minute you get sick and

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,159
you all of a sudden have things that

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,720
just can't be explained by doctors or

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,799
that can be but you can't get resolv and

29
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,640
you're young it's an unbelievable

30
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,200
mindblower I'm seeing it more and more I

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
talk about this a lot now because I see

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,960
it every day now and it's really sad

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,560
back in the you know back years ago

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,640
decades ago doing this you didn't see

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,079
that as much but now we're just we're so

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,360
conditioned that science and research

37
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,200
knows everything about anything doesn't

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
matter what it is just go you know what

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,119
I mean just go to the doctor and if it's

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,320
not a cold which is really there are no

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,920
colds it's just flu there is no colds

42
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,200
there are no colds the cold viruses are

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
gone have been gone they've been killed

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,159
off overshadowed by the flu the flu is

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
what everybody gets some people get a

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,960
mild rendition some people react

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,439
differently some people get our worse

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,439
flu there's different strains of flu

49
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:52,560
that's just an example of what happens

50
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,960
here and we call it cold which is

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,560
actually not that's not how it works

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
there are no colds it's all flu now and

53
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,799
that's how it works when people get the

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,439
sniffles oh you got the sniffles oh you

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,200
got the sinuses and the congestion and a

56
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,880
little cough that's the flu it always is

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,399
and that's just a prime example of the

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
misinformation out there that's really

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,120
annoying but the point is if it's not

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,680
just something like the flu and then you

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,360
go and get an antibiotic for some kind

62
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,599
of chest cold or something meaning like

63
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,200
not chest cold you get some kind of like

64
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,840
chest bronchial spasms and cough and

65
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,640
everything else and you go to the doctor

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
and you get an antibiotic or whatever it

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,280
is you're on cough medicine and you just

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,800
you know you get better from the flu or

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,319
whatever even if the antibiotic didn't

70
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
have a whole lot to do with it cuz flu

71
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,120
are viral what happens is the whole deal

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,159
what happens is you think they just got

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,200
it all down you got it all down but it's

74
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,800
not it's not reality it's not how it

75
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,800
works it's unbelievable out there and so

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,319
we're talking about chemical

77
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,440
sensitivities and I'm drilling this home

78
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,760
a little bit chemical sensitivities is

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,040
what the show is about and I'm drilling

80
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,840
this home a little bit because it's

81
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,360
important to know this because people

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
with chemical sensitivities exactly

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
research in science they they're not

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
they're not like

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
they don't have it down with chemical

86
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,799
sensitivities people suffer they suffer

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,560
horribly terribly tremendously and and

88
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,000
this is a prime example a whole another

89
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,879
prime example and I'm not just talking

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,440
about illnesses that have names that are

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
common and everything else and that

92
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,920
people have every day like excus rasis

93
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,560
and Hashim Modas and everything else

94
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,319
restri science don't even have those

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
down either that's the whole point

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,680
that's chronic illness that's how it is

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,080
and it's always blamed on genes or your

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,439
body attacking itself which is

99
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,400
ridiculous cuz that's not how it works

100
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,799
it's how the body works so if you're new

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
to the show the information is Advanced

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,080
it's way ahead of what's out there now

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
it always has been and no one's talking

104
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,599
about it you can go online you can do

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,159
all this stuff you're not going to get

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,400
the medical medium information anywhere

107
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,400
else does it work put it this way

108
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Decades of people getting better and

109
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,280
better and better just the celery juice

110
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,439
alone is changing the world in health on

111
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,319
all levels it's unbelievable and that

112
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,200
came from medical medium so that the

113
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,920
whole point is let's get all the other

114
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,680
gems and jewels we're talking about

115
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,239
rescue the book live a rescue this is a

116
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,879
book of all books that I've ever done

117
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,599
and and I say that because first of all

118
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,480
it's so huge it's such a big book it's

119
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,200
really intense it's packed it's

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,760
jam-packed it's a really serious book

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,359
and that's one thing all on its own and

122
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,919
and and it's so packed with so many

123
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,519
different conditions and illnesses and

124
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,360
everything else to understand and the

125
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,040
information about the liver and all that

126
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,120
that everybody needs but it's not just

127
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,360
that we're talking about CH chemical

128
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,840
sensitivities which chemical

129
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,280
sensitivities is there there's a little

130
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,199
section in the book

131
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,199
and it's important to know what's

132
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:37,919
happening how it works and everything

133
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,199
else around it very important show if

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,280
you don't have a chemical sensitivity it

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,440
doesn't mean you're not being affected

136
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,759
by chemicals chemicals that research and

137
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,800
science created funny how's that isn't

138
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,919
that

139
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,240
interesting research and science creates

140
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:01,160
all kinds of bad things and nothing but

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,600
bad things okay meaning like also some

142
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,520
good things of course but lots of bad

143
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
things chemical sensitivities well

144
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,240
everything behind them including the

145
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
chemicals that make people sensitive

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
including basic chemicals that make

147
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,000
people sensitive was some kind of

148
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,039
research and science behind it that

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,479
created it so it's just it's just

150
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:24,240
amazing how it goes I mean right no

151
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,720
irony I don't know I I definitely think

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
it is I definitely think it is so let's

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
go into chemical sensitivities this is a

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,840
big deal Big Show I'll tell you why

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,360
because people suffer they suffer with

156
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,880
these chemical sensitivities and I think

157
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,880
we have to be more more sympathetic I

158
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,440
think we have to be more compassionate

159
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,360
actually about it chemical sensitivities

160
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,199
are so frustrating for people who deal

161
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,560
with them it's no joke part of it is

162
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,479
physical suffering the physical

163
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,800
suffering is uh is extraordinary it's

164
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,479
really really difficult that's a big

165
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,080
part of it okay the other part is an

166
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,160
unsym athetic World an

167
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,680
unsympathetic world that's the other

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,080
part of chemical sensitivities that I

169
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,440
don't like the average person who's

170
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,319
never had to deal with a sensitivity

171
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,599
will view someone with sensitivities as

172
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,759
probably bat crap crazy most likely

173
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,440
that's what they would probably view

174
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,280
somebody like that or an ultimate

175
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,080
hypercondriac or Stark crazy or

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,199
something um so you yeah and that's

177
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,280
really hard I mean it's really hard it

178
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,280
really is unless there's this visible

179
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,240
allergic reaction unless it's like

180
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,840
somebody with a peanut allergy goes an

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
athlectic shock and they have to use you

182
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,199
know an EpiPen or whatever it is and you

183
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
know meaning whatever because there's

184
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,280
different kinds of there's different

185
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,680
kinds of injectors and different kinds

186
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,240
of um things that are out there being

187
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,919
offered right now thanks to science

188
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,360
exactly some of the good stuff to save

189
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,360
people's lives but peanut allergies in

190
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,080
general kind of came about because of

191
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,240
science and research too

192
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,759
so that's a whole another thing but uh

193
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,720
we can talk about that another time so

194
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,800
here's the deal it's yeah it's exactly

195
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,280
it's almost like oh here's a remedy not

196
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,360
a cure but here's a remedy to something

197
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,800
we created we created the the the peanut

198
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,479
allergies literally not the peanuts but

199
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,639
the science of research created it I

200
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,039
want to talk about it a little bit I

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,080
can't help it and yet we don't have a

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,199
cure for what we created classic classic

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,160
so here's a remedy to try to get you out

204
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,639
of like you know total total um you know

205
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,479
epilc shock so that's the whole bit so

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,000
anyway usually people who if it's not

207
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,560
something like that people think you're

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,080
crazy if it's not something where you

209
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,879
know you got close throats blocking the

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Airways and it's hard it's hard for an

211
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,440
observer to think that there's anything

212
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,199
you know valid

213
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,400
validation about chemical sensitivities

214
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
right it's hard for anybody to take it

215
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,240
seriously it's hard for anybody to

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
actually care enough too really

217
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,120
difficult that's where I'm talking about

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,680
the unsympathetic world doesn't mean

219
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,919
someone's not a good person and they

220
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,120
just don't care it's that's not it it's

221
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,759
just it's just people don't care I mean

222
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't know what else to say I mean

223
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,919
right so that's just one thing chemical

224
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,680
sensitivity

225
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,960
suffers reactions are very they're very

226
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,919
often

227
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,560
invisible that's what I'm trying to get

228
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,319
at here

229
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,919
invisible very important invisible to

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,320
the outside eye making it

231
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:37,240
challenging for people to find Advocates

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,519
making it challenging instead they're

233
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,560
often told that they're making up their

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
sensitivities you know looking for

235
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,880
attention that's brutal I mean that's

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,240
brutal seriously or that it's

237
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,640
psychological maybe see a psychiatrist

238
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,600
see a shrink see whatever they maybe

239
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:58,000
treat it with an ey roll right the eye

240
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,920
roll I just did one just now and they

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,920
may be treated like that I do that for

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,519
research in science with chronic illness

243
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,120
I always do that the eye roll like oh

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,720
here we go get another bogus another B

245
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,720
bogus junk crap study that's just backed

246
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,720
by investors to make something try to

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,839
have an outcome and just whatever put

248
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,760
the thumb on the scale and you know when

249
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,279
it comes an a chronic illness and

250
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,920
whatever it's just it's unbelievable I

251
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:23,760
do the eye roll all the time and and so

252
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,920
what happens is people do the ey roll to

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,760
chemical sensitive he sufferers and then

254
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,600
they may be told that they're

255
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,839
attracting their chemical sensitivity my

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,240
favorite annoyance of all is they may be

257
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,120
told that they're creating it

258
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,920
manifesting it yes you want to manifest

259
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,000
good things you do it's not a bad word

260
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,880
you want to do the best you can in every

261
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,120
way to generate the best you can to you

262
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,279
good energy absolutely you better

263
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,800
believe it good spiritual energy good

264
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,600
everything but but seriously it gets

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,360
used against anybody who has a hard time

266
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,440
not the part part that the word is there

267
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,680
not the part that the that the you know

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,079
the it's popular or trending whatever it

269
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,360
is everybody's trying to manifest

270
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,880
something that's not it that that

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,600
doesn't bother me what bothers me it's

272
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,920
it's it gets used against anybody who

273
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,399
has a hard time anybody who's doing good

274
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,519
should manifesting good stuff they're

275
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,000
all just the manifestation is working

276
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,560
anybody who's going through a hard time

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,079
you know you say you got a yoga studio

278
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,120
and you got 50 people in the yoga studio

279
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
and there's everybody's trying to

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,160
manifest something but if someone's

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
having terrible luck if someone's having

282
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,959
bad luck you know or someone's having

283
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,519
some difficult time yeah people are just

284
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,480
be like you're just not manifesting

285
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,959
right you're not you're not Greatful

286
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,560
you're not manifesting right and what

287
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,120
happens is it gets thrown on to people

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,360
chemical sensitivities you're not

289
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,360
manifesting you know whatever and you're

290
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,360
just you're just emotional what whatever

291
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,519
it is it's just not healthy I don't find

292
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,720
it healthy and creating your own illness

293
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,480
is a big topic I put in thyroid healing

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,720
for a reason because it's that obnoxious

295
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,240
because people think they're be they're

296
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,880
being told they think they're creating

297
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
their own illness and let me tell you

298
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,720
something that might be okay for

299
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,120
somebody who's 40 to think they could

300
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,720
probably handle handle it okay but when

301
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,079
you got somebody who's 15 and they think

302
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,880
they're manifesting their their illness

303
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,480
and you got somebody who's 14 or you got

304
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,519
somebody who's 19 and they're looking

305
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,000
into things and they think they're

306
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,320
manifesting their bad luck or their

307
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,360
illness or their or their or their

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,680
adversity it's

309
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,519
disastrous on a level you can't

310
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,240
imagine

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,320
disastrous it can tank someone it can

312
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,720
really get them to do something

313
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,279
absolutely stupid out of that alone not

314
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
good and not healthy I'm not I'm not

315
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,399
kidding around same same with somebody

316
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,480
who's in their 20s they think they're

317
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,360
not manifesting the right you're such a

318
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,399
like a vulnerable age everything about

319
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
it and if you think you're the cause of

320
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,120
why you got something going down like

321
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,880
that because you're picking up on that

322
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
whole manifestation thing it could be

323
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,160
damaging it's cute for the 40-year-olds

324
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,800
50y olds whatever they can kind of shrug

325
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,680
it and move past and if it's working not

326
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,200
working how they feel whatever I'm going

327
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,639
about the manifestation thing a little

328
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,040
bit too long I know and I'm going into

329
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
it a little bit but I have to because

330
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,519
I'm going to tell you right now chemical

331
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,720
sensitivity people they've been told

332
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,079
they're manifesting their problem

333
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,920
because they're told that a the problem

334
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,079
is not real B if their problem is real

335
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,800
and it's considered it then it's

336
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,440
something they're doing wrong because

337
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,880
there's no answers once again for

338
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,800
research and science about chemical

339
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,600
sensitivities anything there's no real

340
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,079
answers for it it it's it's it's it just

341
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
becomes like this that's why I'm going

342
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,760
into this a little bit I had somebody

343
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,519
personally who you know who came to me

344
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,519
and they said look I'm I'm thinking

345
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,279
about I'm thinking about just giving up

346
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,760
giving up because I'm obviously

347
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,199
manifesting it all wrong and and I don't

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,839
know what to do to fix it because I

349
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,079
still have problems coming my way and

350
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,680
I'm trying to deal with them and I got

351
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,519
the chemical sensitivities and I got

352
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,279
this and I got that I got this mold

353
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,920
problem in my house I got major chemical

354
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,639
sensitivities I got all this other stuff

355
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,279
I've been I've spent all my money I've

356
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,760
completely exhausted myself on all

357
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,920
levels and I'm just literally at the end

358
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,880
of my rope and I said just just just

359
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,680
forget the concern just forget the

360
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,360
manifestation thing just move that out

361
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,160
of your way you didn't create anything

362
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,560
you're not you're not manifesta things

363
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,519
the wrong way I said it's chemical

364
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,000
sensitive person it saved their life

365
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,920
they were literally contemplating

366
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,120
something grave and it saved their life

367
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,040
I'm just telling you right now okay it's

368
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,839
saved their life I've seen it happen

369
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,160
more than once where lives have been

370
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,320
saved by moving that aside moving that

371
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,880
over and saying here's the real problem

372
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
and here's what's really going on and

373
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,600
we're going to actually work on it and

374
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
we're going to get you in the right

375
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,680
place there are real answers there are

376
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,519
real causes just hang in there it's

377
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,120
going to be okay compassion compassion

378
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,839
compassion manifesting isn't about

379
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:55,240
compassion okay move on move

380
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,320
on and is that important so what we

381
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,320
really need is to do is to find

382
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,959
compassion the people who deal with

383
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,199
chemical sensitivities and other chronic

384
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:07,199
illnesses we need compassion for we have

385
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:11,920
to dig it out of us in any way we can

386
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:14,240
for others in any way we can somehow we

387
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,959
have to find it we got to dig it out and

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
we have to make it happen okay there's

389
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,440
nothing wrong with that there's nothing

390
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,600
wrong about being positive there's

391
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,480
nothing wrong with trying to create your

392
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,800
life in every way and your destiny and

393
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,560
controlling it and all that everything

394
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,079
don't get me wrong it's just there's

395
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,279
certain little laws in the manifestation

396
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,759
game that I'm was trying to tell you

397
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,880
about a little bit okay so we have to

398
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,000
dig out that that whole compassion we

399
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,839
have to dig it out for chemical

400
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,120
sensitivity people because they are real

401
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,920
they are real they're very very

402
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,240
difficult situations when sensitivities

403
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,279
are moderate to extreme individuals will

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680
often confine themselves to home because

405
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,279
it feels like it's the only safe place

406
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,959
but there's a catch 22 so many people

407
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,880
are in just situations where they

408
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,320
feeling like their chemical

409
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,320
sensitivities are actually in the home

410
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,240
theirself or in their homes

411
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,160
that's really diffic difficult so

412
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,680
difficult and so they're in this Catch

413
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,040
22 right you guys you know when they

414
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,480
think their apartment you know there's

415
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,680
all kinds of things there's mold this

416
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,279
that there's everything else and

417
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,600
sensitivities and and you know whether

418
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,680
carpet cleaning fragrance outgassing

419
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,920
construction materials chemical presence

420
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,279
in the home they're always worried

421
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,040
people are like crap they're like

422
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,519
strapped in there and they're trapped

423
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,800
but yet they got knowwhere else to go

424
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,160
because they don't have where else to go

425
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,839
I'm serious this is really hard

426
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,279
and since the outside world has its own

427
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
threats often unpredictable ones like

428
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,880
these people feel like they can't go

429
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,199
anywhere you go into a department store

430
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,120
and you're just completely covered in

431
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,079
Cologne and and plugging fresheners and

432
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,560
God knows what things that actually yeah

433
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,560
things that make Chemical sensitivities

434
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,319
worse and worse and worse and worse you

435
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,000
better believe it yeah that's right you

436
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:58,120

439
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,920

person to person too and there's a lot

464
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,439

dollars and something okay so here's the

495
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,120
deal it's almost as if these

496
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,720
sensitivities move and shift for a lot

497
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,880
of people and the condition Alters out

498
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,600
nowhere you know you may need to change

499
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,039
yourself all of a sudden you may need to

500
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,640
change your perfume you're sensitive

501
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,120
perfume when you weren't next time it's

502
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,760
hairspray like oh my God I wasn't

503
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,320
sensitive to hairspray or aerosol some

504
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,799
kind of aerosol but now I am so that can

505
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,120
all

506
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:43,840
happen maybe you're you're you then

507
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,960
become sensitive to your allnatural

508
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,120
shampoo that you always that always did

509
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,919
you right this is how difficult it is

510
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,559
the inconsistency can make somebody go

511
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,280
crazy not because they're crazy to begin

512
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,760
with no they got the chemical

513
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,159
sensitivities but they end up going

514
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,080
crazy you can it's really difficult and

515
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,799
and and and we have to have compassion

516
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,559
for this this topic you know you may be

517
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,600
one of those people who finds your

518
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,200
sensitivity

519
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,120
manageable but if you don't take care of

520
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,480
something it could become unmanageable

521
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,799
there's something you got to learn to

522
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,520
take care of there's something you got

523
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,720
to learn how to do there's something you

524
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,840
need to do you guys in order to make

525
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,240
sure you don't run into that kind of

526
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,240
problem where it becomes

527
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,159
unmanageable

528
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,880
yeah because there's a lot to do with a

529
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,799
lot of things here we're going to cover

530
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,320
that so we got to be careful and you got

531
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:47,840
to make sure you got to make

532
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:51,200
sure that look for example to avoid a

533
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,080
plug-in air freshener when you can and

534
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
you get by so you feel like you can

535
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,440
manage it that's a mild sensitivity but

536
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,440
then there a person who has to avoid

537
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,720
multiple items conventional hairsprays

538
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,200
colog fabric softers Cleaning Solutions

539
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,320
and yes fresheners air fresheners of

540
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,880
course which many people can't tolerate

541
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,320
and rightfully so it's

542
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:18,120
toxic toxic because you're extremely

543
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,039
toxic because the enemy just a whiff is

544
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:23,760
a debilitating situation here

545
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,679

medium and I didn't just start this 5

600
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,559
years ago I've been doing this literally

I'm at your service um so it's important

616
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,159
so cleaners are bad too these plug-in

617
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,000
air fresheners bad chemically treated

618
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,039
pulper can sneak up on you so how are

619
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,159
you going to function when you don't

620
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,559
know where you're going like you're at

621
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:57,960
the dent office wherever you go and you

622
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,919
got to worry about all these things

623
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,279
things

624
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,840
nonstop and there's an activator around

625
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:09,400
every corner an instigator around every

626
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,400
corner for god sakes every

627
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,480
corner yeah

628
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,760
exactly

629
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,360
exactly and even Christmas trees are

630
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,840
sprayed with some kind of concoction to

631
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,480
keep them looking green as long as

632
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,720
possible or as fresh as looking possible

633
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,679
and even fake fake Christmas trees are

634
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,039
treated with nanotechnology now and

635
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:31,240
solutions that can set somebody off so

636
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,200
Christmas becomes a bummer a bummer if

637
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,000
you celebrate

638
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,440
Christmas you

639
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,240
know those who are chemical sensitive

640
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,640
are forced to become experts they're

641
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,880
forced to become an

642
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,279
expert they're forced to become an

643
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
expert and you know it it it's difficult

644
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,120
and it doesn't mean there's still an

645
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,360
expert they're an expert at maybe what

646
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,880
could be triggers but they're not an

647
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,120
expert at what the heck's causing it cuz

648
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,240
science and research once again leave

649
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,679
everybody hanging leave everybody

650
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,400
hanging all that research money goes

651
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,200
into just whatever investors are putting

652
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
it into at all the time thumb on the

653
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,799
scale leaving everybody hanging in

654
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,039
chronic illness like you can never

655
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,919
believe

656
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,360
unbelievable and you know you can have

657
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,240
all the best technology you want and

658
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,200
still someone has chronic UTI with no

659
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,360
with taking antibiotics once a month

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,880
with no like no sight no sight in front

661
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,279
of them of it being like the light

662
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,440
coming yeah that's just one little thing

663
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:40,640
I talk about that in Liver Rescue a show

664
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,080
thousands of things the um so they

665
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,279
become experts they're forced to become

666
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,799
experts and be mindful that's what

667
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,600
people are do with chemical sensitives

668
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:50,360
are forced to do that's that's how it

669
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,320
works they see things in a different way

670
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,480
they have their eyes and a Different

671
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,760
Light they have to see things in a

672
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,760
different way chemical

673
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,600
sensitivities that you know chemical

674
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,279
sensitivities make it so you have to

675
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,399
leave your rosec colored glasses

676
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,720
behind it's such a bummer you know

677
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,080
because yeah those Road those Rose

678
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,159
Colored

679
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,440
Glasses do tend to get people through

680
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,080
life in many

681
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,080
ways they also get you in trouble too so

682
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,600
maybe those rose colored glasses are not

683
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,880
a good thing they must dedicate an

684
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,559
immense amount of energy that's that's

685
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
what these people have to do that's what

686
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,960
you guys have to do in reading labels

687
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,000
have you ever done that done the label

688
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,880
thing but you really have to read the

689
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,240
labels right not just a little bit and

690
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
you got to figure out what's in really

691
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,360
what's in every product how they come

692
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,120
across everything ingredients you name

693
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,720
it pets and pet stuff too all of

694
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,360
it it's

695
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,200
unbelievable and you're all about

696
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,720
hyperallergenic that's what we got to

697
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,600
all be about so that's another thing too

698
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,240
it's

699
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,840
endless and and even clothes you know

700
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,039
saturated with multiple synthetic

701
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,000
laundry chemicals you know and air

702
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,080
fresheners that go on clothes and

703
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,760
leeching out oils doesn't have an effect

704
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,880
unknown effect meaning it's unknown

705
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,440
effects on humans it has real effects

706
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,399
see here's the thing if everybody thinks

707
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,039
they're escaping all of this they're

708
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,520
wrong they're wrong just cu the canaries

709
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,760
just because the

710
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,360
canaries are being affected first

711
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,360
doesn't mean you're not being affected

712
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,799
now now and later never forget unless

713
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,279
you do something and take care of what

714
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,799
your liver that's what we're going to go

715
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,480
into pretty

716
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,000
soon those who are newly chemical

717
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,559
sensitive and you guys will probably

718
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,240
ring true on this you'll tell me you'll

719
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,039
be like yeah he

720
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,880
knows those who are newly chemical

721
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,320
sensitive have a very tough time of it

722
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,799
oh man is it rough new chemical

723
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:55,320
sensitivity for a new person a new be on

724
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:57,320
the Block whoa it's rough it's rough and

725
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,760
maybe I'm look I just think it is but

726
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,919
maybe I'm wrong you tell me am I wrong

727
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,760
about that one when you were brand new

728
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,320
at it with chemical sensitivity was was

729
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,559
it was it's was it extra difficult that

730
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,799
me my wrong I don't

731
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,080

spirit is but I'm not you know you know

733
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,880
the story in the book Origins medical

734
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,120
medium I stepped on a rake smacked me

735
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,960
right in the

736
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,480
[Laughter]

737
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,919
face

738
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,919
um even though the person I was talking

739
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,640
to could walk again because it's Spirits

740
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,440
information I do stupid things though

741
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,200
personally separate I'll say something

742
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,799
stupid step on a rake smack it in my

743
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,760
head cuz I'm not looking at where I'm

744
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:43,200
going so those who are newly chemically

745
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,760
sensitive have a very tough time of it

746
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,399
first there's a process of becoming

747
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,039
aware that's brutal that something's

748
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,240
even wrong that's really hard it can

749
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:54,440
create a tremendous amount of confusion

750
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,960
stress headaches for the first time

751
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,200
funny taste in your mouth runny nose

752
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,360
it's always happening tingling tongue

753
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,399
certain settings you tingling tongue in

754
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,240
certain settings of your life getting

755
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,000
tired easily while walking through a

756
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,880
department store and breathing in

757
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,080
thousands of synthetic chemicals or

758
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,039
starting to feel a tight chest in the

759
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,720
workplace that's really annoying from

760
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:17,480
fragrances or other air day-to-day stuff

761
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,960
yeah these aren't fun symptoms you think

762
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,799
they're fun

763
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,080
no

764
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:27,000
newbi have a difficult challenge they

765
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,000
have to find a doctor who doesn't say

766
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,399
it's all in your head or maybe some some

767
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,880
kind of motivational person to say

768
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,360
you're not manifesting right that's why

769
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,519
I mentioned it

770
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,880
earlier yeah or you'll be shoved into

771
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,519
the Lyme disease trap oh my God if you

772
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,480
know listen if you want to know the

773
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,480
truth about lime get medical medium book

774
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:53,519
one read the lime chapter and try not to

775
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:55,559
bring a torch or shovel or pitchfork to

776
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,039
to to you know to my apartment building

777
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:59,519
because when because when you learn the

778
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,039
truth of Lyme disease it can anger

779
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,399
people that's what I've learned even

780
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,000
though there's all these there's there's

781
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,159
actually at this point now hundreds of

782
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,240
thousands healing from Lyme disease when

783
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,519
they learn the truth from the

784
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,519
information from medical medium but

785
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,720
still it just still angers people

786
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,080
because when you're conditioned a

787
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,360
certain way and and to think a certain

788
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,720
way and the labs they train you and

789
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,880
condition the doctors and train the

790
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,919
people it gets frustrating it gets

791
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,960
frustrating but there's just you know

792
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,720
it's unbelievable how things work but

793
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,919
you might get thrown into that whole

794
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,799
thing you know that that whole lime trap

795
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,720
can easily get thrown in there so you

796
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:37,200
got to remember that can easily happen

797
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,880
and it does it does it gets a lot of

798
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,679
people and it's really difficult and you

799
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,200
want to be careful you don't end up like

800
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,000
that because it happens now you know

801
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
anyone with chemical

802
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,919
sensitivities anyone with any kind of

803
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,840
chemical sensitivities has a challenge

804
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,480
on their

805
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,399
plate really a big Challenge and you

806
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,720
need to you know in finding support from

807
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,559
a family member or friends is difficult

808
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,399
too they may be bewildered or become

809
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,200
sick of it all easily and come they

810
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,360
could get sick of it quite fast there's

811
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,399
no question since everything was fine

812
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,640
before you know your body reactions

813
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,200
aren't easy they're not easy for anyone

814
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,120
to deal with it happens it happens all

815
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,640
the

816
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,000
time it's not and you know and people

817
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,399
you know they got the perfumes and the

818
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,840
makeups and they got the clones and the

819
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,960
aftershave and you know they're at the

820
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,000
Sal the salon or breathing in car

821
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,360
exhaust and shopping at the mall and

822
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
they got no complaints there's a lot of

823
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,799
people that go through that they can do

824
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,679
anything they can breathe and all those

825
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,720
things throw after after shave is just

826
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,720
horrendous cologne is by far one of the

827
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
I can't stand I can't stomach cologne it

828
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,360
makes me sick and that has nothing to do

829
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
with a chemical sensitivity the smell of

830
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,840
it just makes me like it gets me

831
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,799
nauseous gets me nauseous cologne's a

832
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,240
bad one it's like anytime I run across

833
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,760
somebody and they got clone on their

834
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,919
hands and they got clone all over their

835
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,679
clothes and they shake my my hand or

836
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,399
they give me a hug and it's covered on

837
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,279
me I have to go and I have to change my

838
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:06,480
clothes because the cologne is brutal it

839
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:08,960
just it sits there and it gets caught in

840
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,200
your sinuses and it stays in your

841
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,519
sinuses and you get tasted and it ruins

842
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
your meal I've had that happen where

843
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,600
I've actually I've actually been in

844
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,960
meetings with people loaded with cologne

845
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,039
where I was inhaling it for hours and

846
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,600
then literally tasting it my sinuses in

847
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,360
my mouth and then we went to go get

848
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,559
something to eat and my food taste it

849
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,440
like cologne I'm like oh my God how do

850
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,720
people live like this how do they live

851
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,480
like this imagine somebody who's

852
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,480
actually chemical

853
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,039
sensitive imagine that situation how

854
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,039
difficult it is you know I just hate it

855
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:44,240
but they're actually chemical sensitive

856
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:46,399
just imagine and I'm aggravated enough

857
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,320
when I run across that where I'm like so

858
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,880
put off I'm like oh my God I just can't

859
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,120
stand this imagine somebody who's

860
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,880
actually getting affected by it in all

861
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,559
these other ways oh my God it's

862
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,080
unbelievable so so you know look someone

863
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,320
can develop a fresh sensitivity and when

864
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,799
they do the reality is

865
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,200
limiting limiting versus what other

866
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,519
people can do and live in their life

867
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,760
they say why can't I be in the real

868
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,480
world why can't I live my life like I

869
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,919
used to why can't I live like everybody

870
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,159
else that just does what they want

871
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,559
living in moderation eat in moderation

872
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,200
just so you know that's all bold that'll

873
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,240
just get you that moderation talk will

874
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,639
just get you that'll just get you

875
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,159
moderation doesn't work when you're

876
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,399
actually dealing with chronic stuff

877
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,360
internally and I'm not just talking

878
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,440
about chemical

879
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,960
sensitivities you know I've been you

880
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,840
know the thing is is I've been a little

881
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,960
bit more I guess sarcastic or annoying

882
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,360
and and and I want to apologize for it

883
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,480
just look listen just I might have just

884
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,080
gotten a little bit more difficult maybe

885
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,799
you know it's like each decade goes by

886
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,519
and you think that you know I live by

887
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,200
the Hope and Faith thing you know that's

888
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,960
how I live is hope faith and um and I

889
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,760
live by that and I always keep you know

890
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,200
faith that you know research and science

891
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,480
is actually going to you know do

892
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,960
something that's just not about the

893
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,960
money they're going to actually really

894
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,320
like help people and I keep on thinking

895
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,399
it's going to happen any minute because

896
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,960
people who work for all these different

897
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,960
situations venues or whatever and

898
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,320
institutions they're all good people but

899
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,919
they're trapped in whatever kind of

900
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,440
bureaucracy that's involved with every

901
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,320
bit of it so I get it so but I always

902
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,919
have this faith that it's going to break

903
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,080
through that all the truths that I bring

904
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
in the medical medium series and

905
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
everything else to help people with

906
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,639
chronic illness is going to break

907
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,039
through more and more and it has it's

908
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,679
helped Millions around the globe

909
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,360
actually at this point but but still

910
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,279
it's not enough and what happens is I

911
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,200
have this this hope and this faith that

912
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,559
the new trendy doctors or the new trendy

913
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,039
people that want to hang their hat on

914
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,039
stuff on stuff that have a whatever and

915
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,399
they put their books out on their

916
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,720
internet information I always think

917
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:42,480
they're going to just come around a

918
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,279
little bit and they just don't and then

919
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,399
I realize I'm alone I realize I'm alone

920
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,559
and but but then I realize I'm not alone

921
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,200
I got you guys you guys are experts you

922
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,120
guys know you guys are practitioners you

923
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,960
guys are doctors and I and I and I know

924
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,320
that I know that but then I I I I also

925
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,240
but I like I said I get can get

926
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,559
irritable and I'm really sorry just take

927
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,399
you just listen just you know please

928
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,000
accept my apologies if you can when I

929
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,480
get sarcastic I get a little bit of

930
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,440
whatever Brash I get a little bit of

931
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,440
abrasive whatever it is it's not towards

932
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,879
anybody it's just it's towards the

933
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,760
industries is what it is it's towards

934
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,000
the industries and maybe a little bit of

935
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,679
the people involved in some of the

936
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,440
industries you like a can't it all right

937
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,240
so here's the deal so I'm on the Hope

938
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,520
and Faith game you know the Hope and

939
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,679
Faith thing is I got faith

940
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,919
I got faith that you know some someone

941
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,800
else is going to actually you know

942
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,520
start start a good fire yeah in the

943
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,200
industries in the industries you guys

944
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,320
are already starting the fires the good

945
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,320
ones you guys are already you know

946
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,960
starting to fires and it's helping out

947
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,320
die out bad fires starting good fires

948
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,800
and you're helping out to die out bad

949
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,760
fires bad fires that become bad Trends

950
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,760
and bad situations that bring people

951
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,839
down so you guys are really doing I'm

952
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,960
just blown away I'm actually just blown

953
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,920
blown away all right so and then you

954
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,280
have people who they have to become the

955
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,079
experts they're already an expert they

956
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,560
discovered their sensitivities years ago

957
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,240
then you got those people right you guys

958
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,839
know who they are you're probably one of

959
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,280
them and they know what they can handle

960
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,440
and what they can't afford they know

961
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
what they can afford when they're

962
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,920
exposed and they know what they can't

963
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,760
afford that's right they also know what

964
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,240
kind of boundaries to push up and put up

965
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,880
there it it even could be predictable

966
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,359
for them and and they can go through

967
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,359
times of feeling better and handling

968
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,680
more than waves of being able to

969
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,079
tolerate less it's a game of chance we

970
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,040
can't confuse chemical sensitivities

971
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,160
with

972
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,680
reactions to harmful chemicals though

973
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,160
we're not talking here about highly

974
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,119
regulated highly regulated and

975
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,440
unregulated chemicals like those to

976
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,640
visibly burn your skin we're not talking

977
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,400
about those substances we we you know

978
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,640
we're talking about substances that we

979
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,480
can't see or feel ones that many people

980
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,160
even can they they can't even smell how

981
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,839
about that you can't even smell it

982
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,480
how does someone develop develop a

983
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,480
sensitivity that's invisible isn't it

984
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,720
interesting how does it even happen what

985
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,280
occurs right did you ever ask that

986
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
question I'm asking that question I got

987
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,440
the

988
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:18,200
answer it all stems from guess what the

989
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:21,880
liver the liver l i v e r the

990
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:25,359
liver and that's one truth that not even

991
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,119
chemical sensitivity people know about

992
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,119
yet the best chemical sensitivity

993
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,720
experts who are affected by it or

994
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,400
so-called experts who say they know

995
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,280
what's going on don't even know that

996
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,160
that's what it's about they don't even

997
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,760
know that's what it's about and if they

998
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,319
did for some reason they got it from me

999
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
and they got it from me long before this

1000
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:46,839
book came out cuz I've been talking

1001
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,319
about this for years and years and

1002
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,760
putting that information out there

1003
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:54,319
see all sufferers of chemical

1004
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,359
sensitivities have their guesses about

1005
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,119
why it happened to them you know they

1006
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,040
often have a landmark they play with you

1007
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,400
know got sprayed by a pesticide walking

1008
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,920
through a condominium Park some people

1009
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,960
think it started the day they ate a

1010
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,400
certain food some say it was the day

1011
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,359
they had their house painted yes these

1012
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,200
experiences can be triggers and the

1013
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,839
realization that something's wrong can't

1014
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,119
occur at these times they aren't the

1015
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,960
whole story though they're not the whole

1016
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,440
story what about the other person who

1017
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,040
got sprayed walking through the park or

1018
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,560
condo or whatever it is and they're not

1019
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,359
affected and they're just fine what

1020
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:30,079
about them how about that how about them

1021
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,920
apples you know he went to the hardware

1022
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,680
store or she went to the hardware store

1023
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,200
purchased her own pesticides on top of

1024
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,839
it sprayed them on their own

1025
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,480
lawn and didn't develop a chemical

1026
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,880
sensitivity maybe it could maybe it

1027
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,680
could happen down the road for him

1028
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,720
absolutely or her you better believe it

1029
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,079
can though not yet that wasn't their

1030
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,000
Landmark for the person who did develop

1031
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,880
a sensitivity it was about what was

1032
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,520
going on internally it was about what

1033
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,960
was happening internally the timing of

1034
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,480
the day in the park was random the Sens

1035
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
was going to happen anyway it had

1036
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,560
already begun somebody who did get

1037
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,440
triggered by walking through the park

1038
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
and they got triggered by a chemical

1039
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,160
that was sprayed or whatever it is

1040
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,319
walking through you know through

1041
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,119
condominium Park they got sprayed yeah

1042
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:16,640
and that seemed like the Treck that was

1043
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,280
that was just a random occurrence it was

1044
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,960
already going to happen it was already

1045
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,960
on its way let's go into chemical

1046
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,599
sensitivities let's go into chemical

1047
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,400
sensitivities baby let's go into that

1048
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,680
let's talk about that a little bit it

1049
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
all starts with the liver as I was

1050
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,240
saying it's your big sponge whose job is

1051
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,160
to collect catalog and check in

1052
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,200
thousands of what I call troublemakers

1053
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,720
in The Liver Rescue book that's right

1054
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,720
chemicals you name it liver's job is to

1055
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,200
try to protect you and shield you you

1056
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,359
know it it it that's its job it even

1057
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,640
Shields you against toxic substances

1058
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,680
your body creates it's natural for the

1059
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,480
body to create that for example when you

1060
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,280
experience fear the adrenals pump out an

1061
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,440
adrenaline that helps you survive at the

1062
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,800
moment but it's highly abrasive and

1063
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,200
toxic and dangerous to your brain and

1064
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,560
central nervous system it's so potent

1065
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,400
though that the liver must clean it up

1066
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,280
and absorb it all up and it's doing its

1067
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:13,960
job to protect you the rest of your body

1068
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,599
so it doesn't get in danger so the the

1069
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,200
rest of your body doesn't get in danger

1070
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,839
and then we also eat foods with bad

1071
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,520
ingredients that's hard on the liver and

1072
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,160
we eat high fat diets which is hard on

1073
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,400
the liver we all eat high fat diets I

1074
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,599
don't care how clean your diet is I

1075
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,880
don't care if it's the best vegan diet

1076
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,040
it is it's high fat unless you're really

1077
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,480
really really really doing a lowfat diet

1078
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,560
and you're probably not even doing that

1079
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,880
right you're not even doing that right

1080
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,079
unless you get enough celery juice and

1081
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,000
how many years have you been doing

1082
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,480
celery juice not long I bet if you have

1083
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,280
even done it celery juice by itself not

1084
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,880
even the best plant-based raw diet

1085
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,040
that's low fat is even getting done

1086
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,319
right doesn't mean you're getting enough

1087
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,200
leafy greens not even the best paleo you

1088
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,839
know low animal protein diet that's got

1089
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,920
a new fancy name to it that I won't

1090
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:56,079
answer I mean that I won't mention cuz

1091
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,800
the names are just getting stupider by

1092
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,359
the minute out there not even that diet

1093
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,480
has probably enough leafy greens in it

1094
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,960
and enough say celery juice and other

1095
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,040
things too and mineral salts and allone

1096
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,960
that so we you know we get we get

1097
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,839
exposed to all kinds of stuff grease we

1098
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,240
eat and grease on our skin exactly we go

1099
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,000
to we go on cruise sh ships and all the

1100
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,599
food on a cruise ship is sprayed with

1101
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,079
the preservative how do you like that by

1102
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,839
law and our livers must tend with it and

1103
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,280
deal with it so as we're dancing on the

1104
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,160
cruise ship and having a great time and

1105
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,079
breathing in everybody's and perfumed by

1106
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,400
the truckloads and all the insecticides

1107
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,440
and all the carpet cleaning chemicals

1108
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,480
that are all in the carpets and we're

1109
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,319
having a blast we're inhaling all that

1110
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,720
the liver's got to take it all in suck

1111
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:39,040
it all up and take it all in and then on

1112
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,560
top of that we're eating all the food on

1113
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,800
a crud ship I'm not ripping apart crude

1114
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,839
ships everything has its toxins and then

1115
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,839
all of a sudden you're eating all the

1116
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,880
cruise ship food forget it it's all

1117
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,680
laced it's all got chemical

1118
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,760
preservatives on it from chemical

1119
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,640
companies and then what about drugs we

1120
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,079
take oh I got a bad migraine let's take

1121
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,440
a drug or whatever it is that's going on

1122
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,640
that we we have to survive with and all

1123
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,119
kinds of things that happen when we

1124
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,359
don't know the cause of all our problems

1125
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,040
we have to do things we end up at the

1126
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,240
doctor's office taking drugs we ingest

1127
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,240
everything like

1128
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,880
that all of it going all the way back to

1129
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:13,200
antibiotics in their childhood they all

1130
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,480
the liver has to suck it up has to suck

1131
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,800
it up that's what it has to do just like

1132
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,560
your coach in high school at track or

1133
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,400
your coach at high school at lacrosse

1134
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,760
are you coach at high school at soccer

1135
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,520
or you coach at High School in in in um

1136
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,839
football or baseball suck it up walk it

1137
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,280
off that's what the liver has to do suck

1138
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:35,240
it up and walk it off that's what it has

1139
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,880
to do pathogens that's a real pain in

1140
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,000
the book cuz guess what that plays a

1141
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,440
real big role in chemical sensitivities

1142
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,960
I hate to drop this truth but it does

1143
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,880
EBV is one of the big ones they find

1144
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,200
their way inside the liver they make a

1145
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,000
home in there and they create a mess all

1146
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,000
on their own releasing waste like

1147
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,240
dermatoxin and neurotoxins it's the

1148
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,359
byproduct see all these troublemakers

1149
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,480
and more your liver is constant

1150
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:00,200
constantly at a ratio game how do I let

1151
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,599
what I got to let out how do I release

1152
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,720
how much I got to let out how do I got

1153
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,800
to control how much I got to control to

1154
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,000
protect them how much viruses inside of

1155
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,560
me how much everything else is going on

1156
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,599
that the doctor has no clue about on any

1157
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,160
level

1158
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,880
yeah how many germs can I come across

1159
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,880
right now how many Road toxins can get

1160
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,480
back into my bloodstream the liver is

1161
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,920
watching all this how many medicines are

1162
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,240
being ingested how many all these kinds

1163
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,160
of things how much alcohol are in herbal

1164
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,680
supplements that I've been shunning for

1165
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,839
decades

1166
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:37,240
decades yeah I've been

1167
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:40,240
shunning that for decades for real yeah

1168
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,720
for real and you know and I'm telling

1169
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,240
you right now that's a bad one all on

1170
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,640
its own doesn't mean your practitioner

1171
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,680
is a bad guy or your doctor's a bad

1172
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,480
person or Bad Gal it's not it at all

1173
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:55,160
they just don't know that the alcohol is

1174
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,720
bad in supplements always remember that

1175
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,119
protect yourself

1176
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,480
um and then maybe you'll teach them

1177
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,760
something So eventually they won't use

1178
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,359
it that's all so they can do their

1179
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,160
beautiful work and help people like they

1180
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:05,760
want

1181
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,920
to how much can the liver afford to let

1182
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,480
go or eliminate from your body that's

1183
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,880
the whole point when you're going to

1184
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,839
bathroom or anything else that's that

1185
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,200
all that's critical to know every every

1186
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:19,640
last bit of this you know when the liver

1187
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,480
is sluggish and the colon is already

1188
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,559
dirty which is most people and yet more

1189
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,640
poisons keep coming in from toxic food

1190
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,520
sources fresh paint a visit to a store

1191
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,960
with sent candles air freshers plugged

1192
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,240
in at dentist office waiting room

1193
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,920
delivery truck spewing out exhaust and

1194
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,559
idles your driveway I'm trying to talk

1195
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,880
as fast as I can cuz I know I run out of

1196
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,319
time every show and I hate running out

1197
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,160
of time with you

1198
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,520
guys cuz I love you guys so all this

1199
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,280
stuff the liver has to deal with it work

1200
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,400
with it in a whole bit toxic weed killer

1201
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,359
that we run across everything we get hit

1202
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,000
with the liver gets hit with and over

1203
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:53,960
time the liver has grown sluggish for

1204
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,480
everybody everybody with chemical

1205
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,000
sensitivities even if it starts younger

1206
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,000
the liver is grown grown tired sluggish

1207
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,200
and problematic the final triggers are

1208
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,599
not the

1209
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,640
cause here this is what I'm trying to

1210
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:09,760
say the final trigger of what you think

1211
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,960
triggered you to chemical sensitivity

1212
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,160
whether it's mold in your house or

1213
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,720
something else is not the

1214
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,440
cause is not the

1215
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,000
cause you can have a viral situation in

1216
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,640
the liver since birth you could have a

1217
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,440
viral situation like Epstein bar in your

1218
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,720
liver for years and that's one of the

1219
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,680
true causes is like the Epstein bar

1220
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,040
virus sitting in there along with strep

1221
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,520
sitting in there

1222
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,559
absolutely percolating eating stuff the

1223
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,839
whole bit and then finally you get one

1224
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,480
last trigger and you think it's that

1225
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,559
trigger that did

1226
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,160
it a sensitive central nervous system is

1227
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,079
behind chemical

1228
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,839
sensitivities it's behind it it's

1229
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,040
another big part of it all and why

1230
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,520
because when you have Epstein bar

1231
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,440
releasing neurotoxins because it's

1232
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,599
eating tons of toxins lots of toxins

1233
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,119
inside your liver and spewing it out of

1234
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,119
your liver and it's floating around your

1235
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,760
body it affects the central nervous

1236
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,200
system and guess what chemical

1237
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,880
sensitivities are all central nervous

1238
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,480
system that's right toxins that the

1239
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,200
liver can't neutralize or contain get

1240
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,440
overloaded and the ner nervous system

1241
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,079
pays the

1242
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,760
price this can take in the form of all

1243
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,680
kinds of things funny feelings in the

1244
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,960
mouth sense that you can't breathe

1245
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,960
deeply or right blurry eyes yep chronic

1246
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,160
headaches migraines fatigue tingles and

1247
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,520
numbness insomnia dizziness anxiety

1248
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,680
depression and

1249
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,359
more yeah and more some of these

1250
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,800
symptoms can happen independently for

1251
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:36,880
example as a result of Epstein Bar's

1252
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,040
neurotoxins going after the nervous

1253
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,760
system chemical sensitivities also can

1254
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,280
cause it and that's all part of it being

1255
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,559
viral

1256
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,559
too yeah big thing to know that's how it

1257
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,920
works often neurotoxins and dermato

1258
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,800
toxins from Epstein bar combined with

1259
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,440
certain toxins stored inside the liver

1260
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,040
create chemical Cent sensitivities

1261
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,559
messing everybody up and causing trouble

1262
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,960
that's the big one I'm I'm telling you

1263
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,319
right now for a person who has

1264
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,000
EBV without the right kind of toxic

1265
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:08,640
heavy metals pesticides and Li and

1266
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,520
chemicals inside the liver may

1267
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,640
experience a different kind of chemical

1268
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,160
sensitivity or not even experience it at

1269

1278
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,359
the liver book you have to

1279
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,000
get you know I was proud of spirit with

1280
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,559
this book when Spirit gave me every bit

1281
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
of the information that was put into

1282
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,040
this book I was proud I handw wrote the

1283
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,800
whole book it was a stack of paper

1284
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,640
almost the height of the ceiling to

1285
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,240
begin with cuz I had to sit there day in

1286
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,880
and day out and take that information

1287
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,839
from Spirit until it was finally done

1288
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,880
that's been my job my whole life

1289
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:02,839
this you know what happens

1290
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,720
is unknown combinations Factor that's

1291
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:07,520
what happens too in medical research and

1292
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,319
science when they try to figure out the

1293
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,920
cause of chemical sensitivities doctors

1294
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:12,680
and other practitioners need to keep an

1295
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,240
open mind and learn that in most

1296
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,720
chemical sensitivity patients the

1297
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,160
central nervous system is the is

1298
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,800
weakened and a viral infection could be

1299
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,559
playing a very large role in all of that

1300
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,240
not every chemical sensitive person is

1301
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:27,520
dealing with an active viral infection

1302
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,440
but they must have had one at one point

1303
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,160
without a doubt at one point even if

1304
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,599
it's not active in the moment that's why

1305
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,119
doctors get confused too because it can

1306
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,800
still make you sensitive if you was

1307
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,000
active at one point if you had Mono a

1308
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,200
long time ago if you had a scratchy

1309
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,720
throat in college and it was actually

1310
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,280
mono but didn't know it was mono cuz it

1311
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,000
just went dormant and went away and went

1312
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,720
to the liver all these kinds of things

1313
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,200
and everybody has Epstein bar in their

1314
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,480
system

1315
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,119
so all of

1316
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:56,480
this all important to

1317
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:58,160
know so the bottom line is many people

1318
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,319
have a chemical sensitivity for a long

1319
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,720
time realize what's going on but when a

1320
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,480
chemical sensitivity makes itself known

1321
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,079
an emotional component kicks in that

1322
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,520
makes physical suffering harder than

1323
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:11,240
ever and that's a part I want to touch

1324
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,839
apart Right Touch with right now what

1325
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,680
could trigger

1326
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:18,400
it what could trigger it next is it

1327
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,359
getting better is it getting worse am I

1328
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,400
dying are all questions that happen with

1329
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:24,040
people with chemical sensitivities it's

1330
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,720
really difficult many people can't put a

1331
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,440
finger on what they're dealing with

1332
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,880
and they can't and it's a mystery fear

1333
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,280
heightens and OCD happens obsessive

1334
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,359
compulsive disorder can happen freedom

1335
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,160
from knowing what it is or the trigger

1336
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:42,240
or not is and everything else is what

1337
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,160
people need it doesn't happen overnight

1338
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,760
it's a slow build getting freedom from

1339
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,200
chemical sensitivities takes time that's

1340
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,799
why I put it in the liver book so you

1341
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,079
can work on this so you can get the book

1342
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:54,359
and work on it and figure out what you

1343
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,319
need to do healing from chemical

1344
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:58,880
sensitivities is possible I've helped

1345
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,680
thousands do it over the

1346
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,359
decades it is possible it is

1347
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,319
possible without a

1348
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,079
doubt I'm not

1349
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,920
blind I'm not blind to the fact that

1350
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,079
chemical sensitivity people have a

1351
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,040
difficult detox you know situation where

1352
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,240
they have difficult detoxing I'm not

1353
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,079
blind to that at all no way many can't

1354
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,680
even take a single supplement in order

1355
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,200
to try to sooth the nervous system or

1356
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,240
detox the liver because they're so darn

1357
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,319
sens of the poor things and you guys

1358
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,079
might be one of

1359
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:36,280
them if this is you don't think you're

1360
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:38,480
stuck food is the answer in this case it

1361
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,440
is and you can take care of your liver

1362
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,960
and nervous system carefully with food

1363
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,760
it's why I got The Liver Rescue book out

1364
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,079
this is just one reason why if you're

1365
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,319
not dealing with chemical sensitivity

1366
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:50,720
but you're interested in the show look

1367
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,400
into the book there's dozens and dozens

1368
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,240
of conditions that the liver is involved

1369
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,119
with that you probably have or deal with

1370
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,680
are dealing with and one one of them is

1371
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,079
not knowing that your liver is breaking

1372
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,280
down over the years so you become sick

1373
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,599
down the road so you may as well take

1374
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,000
care of your liver now and get the book

1375
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,000
it's

1376
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
important

1377
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,839
so trying to get it all out as much as I

1378
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,720
can but it's a fraction of what's in the

1379
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,359
book so we just do the best we can

1380
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,839
you're not the problem if your nervous

1381
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,319
system is really sensitive you may still

1382
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,319
react to certain exposures after you

1383
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,520
even

1384
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:27,040
heal it takes time you'll still have to

1385
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,119
follow certain boundaries work with the

1386
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,760
rules work with the foods be careful try

1387
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,799
not to get too much exposure while

1388
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,920
you're

1389
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:36,760
healing but here's the thing you have

1390
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,040
the right to react to the world that's

1391
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,559
toxic you're not the problem and never

1392
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,599
were toxic chemicals and constant

1393
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:46,200
stressors are the problem

1394
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,079
sensitivities are are not the problem

1395
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,839
it's just it's a valuable thing have

1396
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:53,400
being sensitive being sensitive is

1397
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:56,599
valuable not not not valuable it's

1398
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,599
valuable yeah even if your sensitivity

1399
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:00,280
goes away completely with your liver and

1400
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,799
nervous

1401
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:06,760
system okay even if it went away

1402
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:08,880
completely you're gifted a heightened

1403
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,000
awareness of The Perils of our world

1404
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,280
makes you

1405
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,200
gifted so that you can better protect

1406
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,559

1407
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:21,400
remember that it means you're

1408
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:24,960
gifted knowing

1409
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,359
truth I can't even tell you it's that

1410
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,359
powerful

1411
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,160
the information from the medical medium

1412
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,400
radio shows and the series and the book

1413
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,960
series and everything else and the

1414
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:38,559
articles is information that's not

1415
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:42,319
contaminated it's pure it's

1416
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:46,319
clean and it's not it's not persuaded by

1417
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:48,680
belief systems it's not persuaded by the

1418
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,200
thumb on the scale and investors

1419
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,880
lobbyists that are in the medical field

1420
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,240
and everything else it's not persuaded

1421
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,359
by all of

1422
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:58,119
that it's not it's clean information

1423
00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:00,400
it's independent and it's an independent

1424
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:02,640
Source take advantage of it while I'm

1425
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,640
still here take advantage of it wherever
