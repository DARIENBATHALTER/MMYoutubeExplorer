[0.36 - 5.48] we're making the Mexican potato hash and
[3.76 - 8.72] we're doing the medical medium shock
[5.48 - 11.72] therapies but we're specifically doing
[8.72 - 13.48] the medical medium aloe shock therapy
[11.72 - 15.72] you don't want to miss this stomach
[13.48 - 18.72] problems anybody digestive problems acid
[15.72 - 21.76] reflux gastric pain burning stomach
[18.72 - 24.32] ulcers AG pylori anything else did
[21.76 - 27.28] anybody get diagnosed with gastritis
[24.32 - 30.08] we're talking about aloe vera lifesaving
[27.28 - 31.60] tool but it's all about how you use it
[30.08 - 33.96] I'm going to teach you guys a lot of
[31.60 - 35.52] different tricks on how to use aloe vera
[33.96 - 37.04] it's going to be really fun we're going
[35.52 - 38.48] to talk about how you eat it we might
[37.04 - 40.48] blend it in some water we're going to
[38.48 - 43.24] talk about what it can do for us all of
[40.48 - 44.48] it this is going to be a big deal we're
[43.24 - 45.88] going to read a little bit out of the
[44.48 - 48.32] book on the medical medium shock
[45.88 - 51.08] therapies going to talk about stomach
[48.32 - 54.60] problems and stomach issues and we're
[51.08 - 57.52] making the Mexican potato hash this is
[54.60 - 59.44] going to be incredible a great episode
[57.52 - 60.48] right here hope you guys relax sit down
[59.44 - 62.00] enjoyed if you if you have the book
[60.48 - 64.32] already we we're looking at the wrong
[62.00 - 67.92] thing really quick let's go find it now
[64.32 - 69.48] if you guys that's why I like being live
[67.92 - 71.00] if you guys actually have the book on
[69.48 - 73.24] hand and you actually have the Mexican
[71.00 - 75.48] potato hash with you that's totally
[73.24 - 77.48] awesome hey let's start putting it
[75.48 - 80.08] together I'm excited but we got a lot to
[77.48 - 83.72] cover a lot to talk about stomach
[80.08 - 85.28] problems wow I know I know
[83.72 - 87.84] ooh
[85.28 - 91.20] o hold on hold
[87.84 - 95.48] on got some flatulence that's trying to
[91.20 - 98.72] move through me and uh guys just have to
[95.48 - 100.96] be like patient patient here with me
[98.72 - 103.32] here I just got to kind of like sit over
[100.96 - 105.52] here for a second I got to get that gas
[103.32 - 109.20] out so just bear with me right now I
[105.52 - 111.40] know it gets in the way um that happens
[109.20 - 113.04] to everybody all the time out there
[111.40 - 114.96] people have stomach problems they
[113.04 - 117.08] they're like holding in their farts
[114.96 - 118.36] they're holding in their gas they're
[117.08 - 120.92] holding in their
[118.36 - 122.96] flatulence I mean they're holding it all
[120.92 - 125.20] in if they're around people their
[122.96 - 127.04] stomach is cramping and they're crossing
[125.20 - 128.88] their legs they're trying to keep the
[127.04 - 131.00] farts in they're trying to keep the gas
[128.88 - 133.08] in they're trying to make sure it stays
[131.00 - 134.96] in because they have all kinds of stuff
[133.08 - 137.00] going on what they have going on all
[134.96 - 139.24] kinds of different things if they went
[137.00 - 140.52] to the doctor and the doctor why we
[139.24 - 142.68] don't know really what's wrong with you
[140.52 - 145.24] you can have this you can have that all
[142.68 - 149.48] of it a lot of people have different
[145.24 - 151.36] things but bacteria is one of those
[149.48 - 153.72] things right there
[151.36 - 157.40] bacteria causing problems in the
[153.72 - 160.00] intestinal tract viruses causing trouble
[157.40 - 161.76] in the intestinal track big big stuff
[160.00 - 164.20] right there so right here I'm going to
[161.76 - 164.20] bring this
[164.36 - 167.64] over let's go into a little bit if you
[166.48 - 169.36] guys just got on here we're doing
[167.64 - 171.28] medical medium shock therapies but
[169.36 - 176.00] specifically we're doing medical medium
[171.28 - 179.96] Alo shock therapy a lifesaving tool all
[176.00 - 181.96] kidding aside on all levels it is a life
[179.96 - 184.44] saving tool for so many people that
[181.96 - 186.72] couldn't eat who have food sensitivities
[184.44 - 188.80] chemical sensitivities problems with
[186.72 - 191.36] their digestion they don't know what to
[188.80 - 193.48] eat they're having stomach pain after
[191.36 - 195.36] they eat they're suffering every day
[193.48 - 197.44] with either a bloating cramp issue
[195.36 - 200.08] gastric spasms all kinds of different
[197.44 - 203.12] diagnoses with their stomach from sibo
[200.08 - 205.76] to gas you know Gast gastritis to
[203.12 - 207.72] Crohn's citis to IBS you know
[205.76 - 210.12] flip-flopping to all three of those
[207.72 - 211.60] sometimes just hey you got H pylori or
[210.12 - 213.76] we don't know what's wrong with you but
[211.60 - 215.84] so many people struggle and suffer
[213.76 - 217.72] inside their gut diverticulitis
[215.84 - 220.32] diverticulosis another great thing we're
[217.72 - 225.36] going to talk about with this right here
[220.32 - 228.12] ulcers this in my hand is a life-saving
[225.36 - 230.28] tool for so many people out there if you
[228.12 - 233.12] know how to use it you know how to do
[230.28 - 236.36] the medical medium Alo shock therapy and
[233.12 - 238.88] know how to apply this it is mindblowing
[236.36 - 239.96] lifechanging for a lot of people I
[238.88 - 241.32] believe there's a whole whole bunch of
[239.96 - 243.44] people that are going to watch this
[241.32 - 246.04] right here and watch the replay on this
[243.44 - 247.64] and they're going to learn what how to
[246.04 - 249.80] use this what's in my hand and they're
[247.64 - 251.76] going to be like oh my god I've been to
[249.80 - 253.76] 20 doctors they didn't know how you know
[251.76 - 256.04] to get my bloating down or my cramping
[253.76 - 257.60] down or my my gastritis that keeps on
[256.04 - 260.16] coming back I've done all the different
[257.60 - 261.80] antibiotics for my sibo and my problems
[260.16 - 264.20] with my intestinal tract problem my
[261.80 - 265.84] microbiome doctor is telling me I have
[264.20 - 267.52] this wrong that wrong I've tried all the
[265.84 - 270.36] different pills and formulas and
[267.52 - 272.76] everything and the antibiotics
[270.36 - 276.20] and then boom suddenly they learn how to
[272.76 - 278.36] do Alo shock therapy and their life
[276.20 - 281.32] changes it is
[278.36 - 283.20] mindblowing their life changes so I want
[281.32 - 285.48] to just give you a little rundown really
[283.20 - 288.56] quick I got an intestinal track in front
[285.48 - 292.12] of me right here in front of you too and
[288.56 - 296.56] what happens to people is bacteria over
[292.12 - 300.24] time creates so much gas because it's
[296.56 - 303.96] feeding off of things that it loves to
[300.24 - 307.20] eat now over time Pockets develop in the
[303.96 - 309.36] small intestinal tract expansions feal
[307.20 - 312.56] matter starts to build up it gets
[309.36 - 314.72] trapped In Pockets the pockets grow they
[312.56 - 317.88] stretch and they
[314.72 - 322.00] expand and in those Pockets more
[317.88 - 324.92] bacteria lives lives happily it feeds
[322.00 - 328.40] has a Feeding Frenzy it hides underneath
[324.92 - 332.92] fecal matter undigested proteins it
[328.40 - 334.68] hides under hardened encased fat that
[332.92 - 338.08] sticks to the lining of the intestinal
[334.68 - 341.96] tract and the colon and the bacteria has
[338.08 - 345.92] a field day in there it produces ammonia
[341.96 - 348.64] and other gases toxic gases those toxic
[345.92 - 351.00] gases put pressure on the intestinal
[348.64 - 354.40] tract lining when that pressure is on
[351.00 - 359.52] the intestinal tract lining expansion
[354.40 - 361.96] occurs elasticity starts to go away the
[359.52 - 363.04] actual lining of the intestinal tract
[361.96 - 366.20] starts to
[363.04 - 369.48] weaken very important to understand and
[366.20 - 370.68] as it starts to weaken expansions and
[369.48 - 373.64] Pockets
[370.68 - 375.28] develop and then we have more and more
[373.64 - 379.60] problems with our intestinal tract
[375.28 - 382.44] gastric spasms peristaltic action issues
[379.60 - 385.00] pain burning
[382.44 - 386.64] cramping it can be so debilitating it
[385.00 - 388.96] could leave somebody in fetal position
[386.64 - 391.44] on a daily basis after they go to
[388.96 - 393.88] bathroom before they go to bathroom and
[391.44 - 397.00] then there's the whole I didn't go to
[393.88 - 399.76] bathroom enough I feel like I'm not
[397.00 - 402.56] finished that's a whole another problem
[399.76 - 405.76] all on its own I feel like I haven't
[402.56 - 408.16] gone to bathroom enough like not enough
[405.76 - 410.68] came out of me I didn't defecate enough
[408.16 - 412.44] I didn't eliminate enough huge thing
[410.68 - 414.72] that happens to people every day out
[412.44 - 417.68] there they don't feel
[414.72 - 420.24] satisfied and that's the thing they're
[417.68 - 422.72] satis they're satisf action when we go
[420.24 - 426.12] to the bathroom it's like we feel like
[422.72 - 428.52] we emptied everything out we feel good
[426.12 - 431.48] about it we feel like everything's
[428.52 - 434.28] working okay the Plumbing's working okay
[431.48 - 436.44] we feel good about it but then our trust
[434.28 - 439.76] starts to break when it's not working so
[436.44 - 442.08] good and our stool doesn't feel right or
[439.76 - 445.36] a lot of our stool doesn't come out just
[442.08 - 448.04] some of it and we feel bloated and
[445.36 - 449.48] inflamed and all hung up in there if you
[448.04 - 453.40] guys just got on here we're talking
[449.48 - 457.16] about medical medium aloe shock therapy
[453.40 - 459.60] one of the most powerful medical medium
[457.16 - 462.68] tools one of the most powerful medical
[459.60 - 464.48] medium tools and a life-saving one I've
[462.68 - 467.48] seen people with crohn's colitis about
[464.48 - 471.76] to get surgery mystery intestinal tract
[467.48 - 475.16] problems for years do Alo shock therapy
[471.76 - 477.08] and free themselves from surgery I've
[475.16 - 478.44] seen it I've witnessed it I know doctors
[477.08 - 480.88] who have seen it and witnessed it
[478.44 - 482.04] through the medical m information so
[480.88 - 483.36] this is probably one of the most
[482.04 - 485.88] profound
[483.36 - 487.44] episodes medical medium history right
[485.88 - 489.60] here we're going to talk about how to
[487.44 - 491.48] use aloe I'm excited and we're going to
[489.60 - 493.24] have some fun make a Mexican potato hash
[491.48 - 495.48] too so let's get into it a little bit
[493.24 - 498.24] more in the intestinal tract and the
[495.48 - 502.00] colon okay
[498.24 - 502.00] so I want to move this
[508.24 - 511.24] over
[511.44 - 518.32] all right let's get into
[514.04 - 522.92] it so we eat our food we eat our food
[518.32 - 525.40] goes down into our stomach our HCL is
[522.92 - 529.20] not strong enough doesn't break down the
[525.40 - 532.24] proteins enough proteins drop into the
[529.20 - 535.60] dadum from the dadum they enter the
[532.24 - 539.00] small intestinal tra not properly
[535.60 - 539.88] digested not properly broken down from
[539.00 - 542.76] there
[539.88 - 548.20] the proteins start to rot and then we
[542.76 - 551.12] get gut rot with that gut rot is ammonia
[548.20 - 555.12] a gas that's produced from the rotting
[551.12 - 557.04] food the rotting food attracts
[555.12 - 559.32] menaces those
[557.04 - 562.16] menaces are
[559.32 - 565.88] bacteria
[562.16 - 567.88] viruses yeast fungus unproductive fungus
[565.88 - 570.92] even some different varieties of
[567.88 - 573.12] mold but either way one thing's for
[570.92 - 575.80] certain bacteria is going to lead the
[573.12 - 579.04] way and it's going to be the one that
[575.80 - 581.68] actually starts to feed off of all the
[579.04 - 584.28] food that's rotting the undigested
[581.68 - 586.88] proteins that are rotting as bacteria
[584.28 - 588.92] feeds off of those undigested proteins
[586.88 - 593.76] the bacteria
[588.92 - 597.40] releases gas and toxins and spews and
[593.76 - 600.00] releases excrement the bacteria
[597.40 - 602.76] basically poops out
[600.00 - 605.48] the excrement poops out the undigested
[602.76 - 607.60] proteins the food and then now it's more
[605.48 - 609.96] toxic than ever before and producing
[607.60 - 612.40] more gas than ever before as this
[609.96 - 615.52] process is happening pockets and
[612.40 - 616.60] expansion start to occur in the small
[615.52 - 619.76] intestinal
[616.60 - 623.00] tract these pockets and expansions make
[619.76 - 625.44] it so then we feel like we got a
[623.00 - 628.48] stitch we actually have a stitch like
[625.44 - 630.08] ooh what is this this is like whoa I
[628.48 - 631.84] kind of feel this after I went to the
[630.08 - 635.64] bathroom I don't know why this kind of
[631.84 - 636.92] hurts these are what I call stitches not
[635.64 - 639.28] the kind of stitches when you cut
[636.92 - 642.28] yourself and you go and you get sutured
[639.28 - 645.12] up not those kind of stitches stitches
[642.28 - 648.60] where they feel like a sharp knife
[645.12 - 651.88] jabbing you or like a pricker bush
[648.60 - 654.48] inside of you or something where it's
[651.88 - 657.08] sharp and Jagged and it gets you for a
[654.48 - 658.04] minute and then it moves on along after
[657.08 - 661.44] a little
[658.04 - 663.64] while that Stitch can shift and now that
[661.44 - 666.56] Stitch isn't up here anymore on the left
[663.64 - 669.68] side now that Stitch is down lower on
[666.56 - 671.76] the left side or that Stitch is down rer
[669.68 - 675.52] on the right side down rer on the right
[671.76 - 678.64] side down lower but the Stitch can move
[675.52 - 681.28] and shift around so as our food is
[678.64 - 685.36] rotting inside of our gut producing
[681.28 - 688.80] ammonia gas and then a Feeding Frenzy
[685.36 - 691.44] occurs bacteria mainly feeding off all
[688.80 - 693.64] the different undigested proteins and
[691.44 - 696.16] and the foods you're eating as this
[693.64 - 698.56] keeps on going every single day week
[696.16 - 701.32] after week week after week we get
[698.56 - 703.80] expansions but we get expansions before
[701.32 - 705.48] we get narrowing and narrowing is
[703.80 - 707.56] another topic right here that's very
[705.48 - 710.28] important
[707.56 - 713.00] expansions are the first thing that
[710.28 - 714.64] occurs and then narrowings come later
[713.00 - 716.08] now how does a narrowing occur inside
[714.64 - 719.04] the intestinal tract and what is a
[716.08 - 723.80] narrowing it's when the intestinal tract
[719.04 - 727.36] back starts to shrink in an area think
[723.80 - 730.96] about a pipe and in that pipe a part of
[727.36 - 734.48] the pipe has a different diameter a
[730.96 - 737.12] smaller diameter so as food's going
[734.48 - 738.52] through it ends up hitting a narrowing
[737.12 - 740.92] but before we go into the narrowing I
[738.52 - 742.96] want to finish up with the expansions
[740.92 - 745.68] first thing that happens in people with
[742.96 - 746.52] digestive problems is they get pockets
[745.68 - 749.92] and
[746.52 - 752.72] expansions so that means the intestinal
[749.92 - 755.44] tract is pocketing out this isn't
[752.72 - 758.00] diverticulosis or diverticulitis this
[755.44 - 761.08] can be a healthy intestinal track that's
[758.00 - 762.68] actually expanding from pressure not
[761.08 - 766.16] just feal matter pressure that's
[762.68 - 768.16] building up but ammonia gas pressure
[766.16 - 769.88] from pathogens like the bacteria feeding
[768.16 - 774.92] off of undigested
[769.88 - 774.92] proteins as the expansion occurs to
[775.12 - 780.12] regularly the the lining of the
[777.52 - 782.40] intestinal tract the wall weakens when
[780.12 - 786.64] the lining starts to
[782.40 - 789.96] weaken we end up getting a narrowing the
[786.64 - 791.36] reason why is because the lining is now
[789.96 - 794.40] too
[791.36 - 798.20] weak the flexibility goes the opposite
[794.40 - 801.84] direction goes inward instead of
[798.20 - 803.52] outward because the lining was stretched
[801.84 - 806.68] so as Pockets develop in the small
[803.52 - 810.56] intestinal tract and the Linings are
[806.68 - 814.12] stretched CU these pockets are
[810.56 - 816.28] outpocketing the lining weakens and then
[814.12 - 820.16] Falls
[816.28 - 822.44] in and so as it falls in we now have
[820.16 - 824.40] narrowing so what happens to people with
[822.44 - 826.72] stomach problems and intestinal problems
[824.40 - 828.44] they have pockets and narrowing so they
[826.72 - 829.80] have some parts of the intestinal tract
[828.44 - 831.80] where it gets
[829.80 - 834.68] narrow some parts of the intestinal
[831.80 - 836.64] tract it's wider and a pocket and this
[834.68 - 839.64] can change and shift in different parts
[836.64 - 843.00] of the intestinal tra over time but it
[839.64 - 847.16] causes a lot of problems chronic
[843.00 - 850.68] gastritis chronic gas chronic bloting
[847.16 - 853.44] chronic stitches gastric spasms chronic
[850.68 - 855.68] IBS chronic
[853.44 - 857.80] constipation chronic
[855.68 - 859.44] diarrhea we got all these different
[857.80 - 862.60] issues because of what's Happening
[859.44 - 864.24] inside inside the intestinal tract now
[862.60 - 866.68] that's the intestinal tract I'm talking
[864.24 - 869.12] about I'm not talking about the Elum and
[866.68 - 871.52] then the ascending colon and then the
[869.12 - 873.40] descending colon and then eventually out
[871.52 - 874.96] the door I'm not talking about that
[873.40 - 877.52] that's a whole another problem where
[874.96 - 879.68] bacteria loves to sit now when people
[877.52 - 883.24] get a sibo diagnosis what they're really
[879.68 - 886.64] getting is a strep diagnosis inside the
[883.24 - 888.88] intestinal tract inside the gut so when
[886.64 - 891.44] someone goes to the doctor or the
[888.88 - 894.60] practitioner and they say hey you got
[891.44 - 897.24] sibo take this antibiotic you're blow in
[894.60 - 898.92] this let's do a blood test let's do this
[897.24 - 901.36] and that let's try to determine what you
[898.92 - 903.20] have let's do a stol sample let's look
[901.36 - 904.96] at some urine and in the end they'll
[903.20 - 909.68] just be like well you have
[904.96 - 911.24] sibo you have small intestinal bacterial
[909.68 - 914.28] overgrowth
[911.24 - 917.00] right but what kind of bacteria is it
[914.28 - 920.96] the bacteria that's leading the way even
[917.00 - 924.88] over sea diff inside people's guts is
[920.96 - 927.48] Strep strep is that one bacteria that
[924.88 - 929.20] reeks havoc and people have more
[927.48 - 932.12] varieties than one
[929.20 - 933.40] they'll have 10 varieties of strep
[932.12 - 935.88] they'll have the strep that gave them
[933.40 - 939.36] strep throat they'll have the strep that
[935.88 - 941.40] gives them acne all over the place
[939.36 - 943.28] they'll have the strep that gives them
[941.40 - 945.24] stomach problems they'll have the strep
[943.28 - 948.88] that gives them
[945.24 - 952.76] UTI bladder infections and kidney
[948.88 - 955.64] infections or commonly known as a yeast
[952.76 - 958.20] infection which really is a strep
[955.64 - 960.72] infection where there's yeast Gathering
[958.20 - 964.48] but the St is the root
[960.72 - 966.92] cause so what people do is they'll do an
[964.48 - 968.56] antibiotic protocol maybe they'll start
[966.92 - 969.52] with that then they'll be told lots of
[968.56 - 972.32] lots of
[969.52 - 973.80] probiotics and lots of prebiotics so
[972.32 - 974.92] they'll be on all these probiotics and
[973.80 - 976.68] all these
[974.92 - 978.28] prebiotics and they'll be doing and
[976.68 - 979.84] they'll be back and forth of this is
[978.28 - 981.56] they get more stomach problems they
[979.84 - 983.44] start to go away then they get stomach
[981.56 - 987.00] problems again they get gastritis again
[983.44 - 991.12] bloating constipation cramping diarrhea
[987.00 - 992.96] IBS irritable bow syndrome which amazes
[991.12 - 995.32] me because the
[992.96 - 996.96] industry named it irritable bowel
[995.32 - 998.64] syndrome made everybody think they
[996.96 - 1000.32] actually knew what was wrong but they
[998.64 - 1003.52] didn't it was just you got an irritable
[1000.32 - 1006.72] vow that's all they had to offer was Sir
[1003.52 - 1008.88] ma'am you got an irritable vow that was
[1006.72 - 1010.52] it so people walk around with an IBS
[1008.88 - 1013.56] diagnosis for years they're like well I
[1010.52 - 1015.64] got IBS I got IBS well what is it oh
[1013.56 - 1017.52] it's uh the doctor said it's IBS it's
[1015.64 - 1019.88] irritable vowel syndrome so what the
[1017.52 - 1023.16] doctor's saying is you have an irritable
[1019.88 - 1025.76] bowel not why do you have an irritable
[1023.16 - 1029.44] bowel or this is what's irritating it
[1025.76 - 1031.92] and so forth Celiac suffers all the
[1029.44 - 1033.72] same people walk around with a diagnosis
[1031.92 - 1035.80] but they don't know what's causing it
[1033.72 - 1038.96] Crohn's colitis Celiac
[1035.80 - 1041.80] IBS gastritis it's another one all on
[1038.96 - 1044.84] its own gastritis what's behind
[1041.80 - 1048.48] it what's behind most of these
[1044.84 - 1050.56] conditions is the bacteria and strep BAC
[1048.48 - 1053.52] bacteria SEI can cause some problems
[1050.56 - 1057.44] with people but CI is either on or it's
[1053.52 - 1060.32] off it's hot or it's cold strep is hot
[1057.44 - 1062.48] all the time and warm so it's always
[1060.32 - 1064.20] there it's always wreaking havoc because
[1062.48 - 1066.96] people don't know how to rid it or clean
[1064.20 - 1068.48] it up or get rid of it and it waks Havoc
[1066.96 - 1071.56] it sits inside their intestinal tract
[1068.48 - 1073.36] forever and it causes problems so if you
[1071.56 - 1075.24] guys just got here we're doing aloe vera
[1073.36 - 1078.04] shock therapy you see a blender here cuz
[1075.24 - 1079.76] I might pull off some aloe vera water
[1078.04 - 1082.20] but I'm I'm going to show you though
[1079.76 - 1084.28] different ways of eating aloe show you
[1082.20 - 1085.76] some tips and how to cut it what you're
[1084.28 - 1088.00] doing how you're not doing the green
[1085.76 - 1090.00] skin so stick around because we got some
[1088.00 - 1092.04] stuff to do and we got some ground to
[1090.00 - 1094.60] cover right now we're talking about
[1092.04 - 1096.52] digestive problems inflammation inside
[1094.60 - 1099.04] the small intestinal tract and
[1096.52 - 1100.84] colon and we can even talk about stomach
[1099.04 - 1102.60] problems too for a little bit we might
[1100.84 - 1105.24] head into there now
[1102.60 - 1107.72] so I have a stomach in my hand right
[1105.24 - 1109.64] here and inside a stomach are stomach
[1107.72 - 1112.52] glands the stomach glands or gastric
[1109.64 - 1114.92] glands they have to stay strong they
[1112.52 - 1118.76] have to be superpowered that's your
[1114.92 - 1120.36] gastric juice your gastric juices a big
[1118.76 - 1122.88] part of how we break down our food break
[1120.36 - 1125.80] down our proteins all of the above with
[1122.88 - 1127.72] food they weaken in people people are on
[1125.80 - 1129.32] coffee and vinegar and all kinds of
[1127.72 - 1131.68] other things and they're under a lot of
[1129.32 - 1134.40] stress and their gastric glands start to
[1131.68 - 1137.04] get beaten down broken down and they
[1134.40 - 1139.36] can't break down their food their HCL is
[1137.04 - 1141.04] non-existent so their food is passing
[1139.36 - 1142.88] through them and starting to rot as we
[1141.04 - 1145.48] talked about
[1142.88 - 1147.60] before another thing that people are
[1145.48 - 1149.80] dealing with that are have gut problems
[1147.60 - 1151.56] is liver issues so the minute someone
[1149.80 - 1154.04] gets diagnosed with any kind of gut
[1151.56 - 1155.64] issue whatsoever cron colitis IBS
[1154.04 - 1158.40] gastric problems stomach cramps
[1155.64 - 1160.08] gastritis whatever it is you have to
[1158.40 - 1163.56] think liver is going to be
[1160.08 - 1166.96] involved a weak stagnant sluggish
[1163.56 - 1169.00] overburdened overworked liver that's
[1166.96 - 1171.72] what's involved right there
[1169.00 - 1174.12] and a liver that's getting fatty a fatty
[1171.72 - 1176.60] liver even if it's not diagnosed such
[1174.12 - 1177.60] livers are fatty before getting a fatty
[1176.60 - 1179.72] liver
[1177.60 - 1182.28] diagnosis you can have a liver issue
[1179.72 - 1185.08] without having elevated enzymes liver
[1182.28 - 1188.48] enzymes you can have a liver issue long
[1185.08 - 1191.72] before there's an elevation of liver
[1188.48 - 1193.68] enzymes important key to know might be
[1191.72 - 1196.12] like hey my liver enzymes are good
[1193.68 - 1198.40] doctor said I'm fine but I still got the
[1196.12 - 1200.36] cramping and the bloating and my stomach
[1198.40 - 1204.36] hurts or the burning in my stomach or
[1200.36 - 1207.28] extra gas or my bathroom isn't right
[1204.36 - 1210.04] however you see it or feel it the liver
[1207.28 - 1212.64] plays a role so stagnant slish livers
[1210.04 - 1216.08] and what happens is that strep bacteria
[1212.64 - 1218.04] will sit and live inside the liver along
[1216.08 - 1221.04] with other pathogens such as viruses and
[1218.04 - 1224.04] so forth but the bacteria the strep live
[1221.04 - 1226.48] in the liver it'll live in a
[1224.04 - 1228.52] gallbladder it'll live in your stomach
[1226.48 - 1231.32] it'll live live in your small testal
[1228.52 - 1232.56] track your colon and it'll live right
[1231.32 - 1237.32] outside your
[1232.56 - 1239.64] anus right outside someone's anus strep
[1237.32 - 1243.16] loves to be
[1239.64 - 1244.80] there and it ends up on people's hands
[1243.16 - 1247.04] and when it ends up on people's hands it
[1244.80 - 1250.60] ends up on everything from grocery store
[1247.04 - 1252.88] shopping carts the door handles to
[1250.60 - 1255.24] everything else someone touches if
[1252.88 - 1258.44] they're not washing their hands enough
[1255.24 - 1260.44] they'll have the strep on their hands
[1258.44 - 1263.04] and strep is interesting because when
[1260.44 - 1264.92] people don't wash their hands and they
[1263.04 - 1267.52] have it on their anus and they get it
[1264.92 - 1269.64] back on their hand they end up putting
[1267.52 - 1271.60] it back on their anus from their hand it
[1269.64 - 1273.72] goes back and forth a symbiotic
[1271.60 - 1275.88] relationship from somebody's hand to
[1273.72 - 1279.64] their anus the strep passes back and
[1275.88 - 1282.32] forth that's how how actually
[1279.64 - 1285.16] tricky strep
[1282.32 - 1286.84] is and crafty it is too all right let's
[1285.16 - 1289.20] go into some aloe vera let's move a
[1286.84 - 1291.48] little bit
[1289.20 - 1293.92] just giving us a little bit of a rundown

[1907.56 - 1911.92] hits them hard and it hits them in the
[1909.44 - 1914.08] strangest places you couldn't
[1911.92 - 1918.00] believe I just couldn't
[1914.08 - 1920.24] believe aloe vera has chemical compounds
[1918.00 - 1921.56] that neutralize acid and Cal nerves in
[1920.24 - 1923.36] the intestinal tract lighting so let's
[1921.56 - 1925.92] go into a little bit we're going to be
[1923.36 - 1928.32] showing you how to use aloe we still got
[1925.92 - 1931.04] a Mexican potato hash to make which I'm
[1928.32 - 1932.64] pumped up about all right so let's hit
[1931.04 - 1936.96] the intestinal track a little bit real
[1932.64 - 1939.04] quick here important to know
[1936.96 - 1942.40] right
[1939.04 - 1945.80] so that intestinal tract is lined with
[1942.40 - 1948.36] nerves little tiny nerves that
[1945.80 - 1950.68] eventually find their way two bigger
[1948.36 - 1952.24] nerves and so all these little nerves
[1950.68 - 1957.56] that are in in the intestinal tract
[1952.24 - 1957.56] lining become hot I call them
[1957.84 - 1962.88] hotpots for over three decades been
[1960.72 - 1965.56] teaching people how to heal their gut
[1962.88 - 1968.28] how to heal their intestinal tract and
[1965.56 - 1971.20] it's a term that came from Spirit of
[1968.28 - 1973.64] compassion long time ago where it's hot
[1971.20 - 1976.32] spots in the intestinal tract hot spots
[1973.64 - 1979.64] are little inflamed areas of the
[1976.32 - 1982.12] intestinal tract lining that are
[1979.64 - 1985.00] saturated with nerves and when anything
[1982.12 - 1987.04] touches them the the nerves light right
[1985.00 - 1990.40] up boom they light
[1987.04 - 1992.32] up so you got food going through here or
[1990.40 - 1994.40] a gas bubble going through here and the
[1992.32 - 1995.44] minute that gas bubble touches one of
[1994.40 - 1998.96] those hot
[1995.44 - 1998.96] spots the whistle
[1999.04 - 2003.56] Blows the Whistle blows the minute
[2001.92 - 2005.72] something moves a piece of food
[2003.56 - 2007.64] something happens something shifts or
[2005.72 - 2009.12] peristaltic action occurs where all of a
[2007.64 - 2012.12] sudden now your intestinal tract is
[2009.12 - 2014.12] twisting it's twisting because it's
[2012.12 - 2015.60] trying to move the food through a
[2014.12 - 2017.28] message is coming from your brain right
[2015.60 - 2019.44] to your intestinal tract lining and it's
[2017.28 - 2022.32] twisting and try to get the message
[2019.44 - 2024.96] through and get the food through and
[2022.32 - 2027.80] when that happens hot spots occur and
[2024.96 - 2029.40] you're like whoa whoa or oh whoa or oh
[2027.80 - 2031.40] whoa and then you can be somebody that's
[2029.40 - 2033.24] inflamed in one area right down here in
[2031.40 - 2034.12] the Elum a lot of people are inflamed in
[2033.24 - 2036.28] the
[2034.12 - 2040.12] Alum and as they're inflamed in the
[2036.28 - 2042.64] elium down here deep right that little
[2040.12 - 2044.48] section it stops food from passing
[2042.64 - 2046.44] through easy so then they get bloated
[2044.48 - 2048.80] and all the gas gets trapped in here and
[2046.44 - 2050.76] builds up all the gas gets built up and
[2048.80 - 2054.68] trapped in here it doesn't even reach
[2050.76 - 2056.52] the colon your gas is way up high all
[2054.68 - 2060.28] trapped
[2056.52 - 2063.76] here we're in aloe vera shock
[2060.28 - 2066.32] therapy all right Al has chemical
[2063.76 - 2069.32] compounds that neutralize acid and calm
[2066.32 - 2073.04] nerves in the intestinal tract Linings
[2069.32 - 2076.96] slowing down and stopping intestinal
[2073.04 - 2078.96] spasms so the goal with the aloe is to
[2076.96 - 2082.28] slow down and stop intestinal tract
[2078.96 - 2085.64] spasms aloe neutralizes acids and
[2082.28 - 2087.92] inhibits bacteria and viral growth as
[2085.64 - 2089.16] well as yeast unproductive fungus and
[2087.92 - 2091.96] mold
[2089.16 - 2094.48] growth she got all these people
[2091.96 - 2096.92] something's growing inside of
[2094.48 - 2099.72] them all these people out there and
[2096.92 - 2103.36] something's growing inside their gut
[2099.72 - 2104.80] unproductive fungus bacteria multiple
[2103.36 - 2107.20] strains of
[2104.80 - 2110.84] bacteria aund different strains of
[2107.20 - 2111.96] bacteria that could not be good ones but
[2110.84 - 2114.80] they're bad
[2111.96 - 2117.84] ones unproductive fungus even
[2114.80 - 2120.52] unproductive mold growth but a lot of
[2117.84 - 2123.80] people have stuff growing inside their
[2120.52 - 2126.44] guts and they can bombard the [ __ ] out
[2123.80 - 2129.04] of their guts with probiotics they can
[2126.44 - 2131.52] try this probiotic and this one and this
[2129.04 - 2133.88] gas thing and this whatever and this and
[2131.52 - 2136.48] they can do all the pill popping they
[2133.88 - 2138.44] want and they can do all the powders
[2136.48 - 2141.16] they want they can do all the
[2138.44 - 2143.00] antibiotics they want and they can just
[2141.16 - 2145.60] put stuff down and because they want to
[2143.00 - 2146.68] heal their gut and it's not going to do
[2145.60 - 2149.00] the
[2146.68 - 2151.36] trick everything in there that's growing
[2149.00 - 2153.04] that shouldn't be growing is growing and
[2151.36 - 2155.56] growing and
[2153.04 - 2158.24] growing it's why the medical medium
[2155.56 - 2160.04] protocols in general
[2158.24 - 2162.84] in general are so powerful like The
[2160.04 - 2165.96] Liver Rescue smoothie heavy metal detox
[2162.84 - 2168.28] smoothie the monoc cleans like all of
[2165.96 - 2169.92] these different parts and tools for
[2168.28 - 2171.20] medical medium information that's why
[2169.92 - 2173.80] they're so powerful like the celery
[2171.20 - 2175.92] juice because it inhibits and it's it
[2173.80 - 2178.08] knocks down that bacteria it knocks down
[2175.92 - 2179.92] that fungus that's
[2178.08 - 2182.84] unproductive so let's go into this a
[2179.92 - 2185.40] little bit suggested
[2182.84 - 2187.28] applications for medical medium aloe
[2185.40 - 2189.44] vera shock therapy for go in that one to
[2187.28 - 2191.20] read a little bit more aloe vera also
[2189.44 - 2193.20] sooes the Linings of the intestinal
[2191.20 - 2195.92] tract calming inflamed intestinal tract
[2193.20 - 2198.60] nerves back to that again our nerves get
[2195.92 - 2202.80] inflamed inside of our gut it causes
[2198.60 - 2204.72] these hot spots to occur things light up
[2202.80 - 2206.56] and you're hurting you're bloating
[2204.72 - 2209.80] hurting cramping

[2422.52 - 2428.96] therapy for an adult consume 2 to four
[2425.76 - 2432.28] inches a fresh aloe vera gel skin
[2428.96 - 2434.72] removed every two to four waking hours
[2432.28 - 2434.72] let's hit
[2437.32 - 2441.68] it all
[2439.32 - 2443.68] right so here's what I want to do right
[2441.68 - 2446.52] here can we get a closeup up there we go
[2443.68 - 2446.52] awesome
[2447.20 - 2452.84] um all right there's your aloe leaf
[2450.64 - 2454.40] right there just going to move stuff
[2452.84 - 2456.76] away a little bit so we can kind of get
[2454.40 - 2458.80] a focus there it is what I what I do is
[2456.76 - 2461.16] you see this knife right here you guys
[2458.80 - 2463.80] on IG you probably can't see the closeup
[2461.16 - 2465.00] but everybody on YouTube Rumble right
[2463.80 - 2467.84] you guys can see
[2465.00 - 2470.84] it so what I'm going to do is cut this
[2467.84 - 2473.20] piece off here little too bitter you can
[2470.84 - 2476.76] use it if you really want but it's kind
[2473.20 - 2480.48] of hard to use this area so I like to go
[2476.76 - 2482.40] just just deep enough like this so I
[2480.48 - 2485.24] discard this or you can use it you can
[2482.40 - 2486.64] put it on your skin you can do that if
[2485.24 - 2488.52] you want to put it on your skin you can
[2486.64 - 2491.12] do that like you
[2488.52 - 2494.56] know can save that
[2491.12 - 2498.08] piece all right 2 to 4
[2494.56 - 2500.00] in of aloe so what do we do we can
[2498.08 - 2503.24] measure it if we want I just just call
[2500.00 - 2507.80] it by I that's about 1 inch right it's 2
[2503.24 - 2510.28] in somewhere around there 3 in 4 in so
[2507.80 - 2514.24] you can do 2 in so let's do that first
[2510.28 - 2517.40] okay so I'm going to cut it just like
[2514.24 - 2519.88] that you guys with me right here here
[2517.40 - 2521.44] guys with me next there's a little
[2519.88 - 2522.28] sticker on here this one's a store
[2521.44 - 2524.88] bought
[2522.28 - 2526.20] one and this one's from my garden right
[2524.88 - 2528.12] here I'm going to open that up in a
[2526.20 - 2530.28] little bit too my garden one doesn't
[2528.12 - 2533.28] look as nice as the store bought one but
[2530.28 - 2536.68] it is nice though all right so I'm going
[2533.28 - 2536.68] to remove that sticker right
[2536.84 - 2542.96] there okay what you do is you take the
[2539.92 - 2545.64] knife and you don't cut it completely in
[2542.96 - 2547.04] half I don't like to do that I cut just
[2545.64 - 2550.44] the
[2547.04 - 2553.80] top part down and then I open it like
[2550.44 - 2556.24] this see this you guys now check this
[2553.80 - 2557.80] out you would think that and you could
[2556.24 - 2560.40] if you wanted to you can think that you
[2557.80 - 2563.80] can use this knife and then slice the
[2560.40 - 2566.36] green off now just so you know you don't
[2563.80 - 2567.72] want the green involved you don't want
[2566.36 - 2570.00] to eat the
[2567.72 - 2572.48] skin you don't want to have the skin
[2570.00 - 2575.16] mixed up in a blender you don't want to
[2572.48 - 2578.76] grind it up you don't want the green
[2575.16 - 2581.48] skin you just want the gel inside now
[2578.76 - 2581.48] I'm going to take a
[2583.60 - 2590.24] spoon I'm using the spoon see how I got
[2586.92 - 2591.68] the spoon this way not that way right I
[2590.24 - 2594.68] don't have it facing down I have the
[2591.68 - 2597.40] spoon facing up what I love about this
[2594.68 - 2600.32] trick once you get the hang of this it's
[2597.40 - 2603.88] the best way to do it I take the spoon
[2600.32 - 2605.08] facing up I stick it under this lip
[2603.88 - 2607.68] right
[2605.08 - 2611.12] here and
[2607.68 - 2613.84] then I keep the aloe
[2611.12 - 2616.00] down and the skin up see what's
[2613.84 - 2620.28] happening right here so I'm using a
[2616.00 - 2623.48] spoon to fillet the skin look how cool
[2620.28 - 2626.12] that is look at that right
[2623.48 - 2628.68] there see what I
[2626.12 - 2632.60] did there you
[2628.68 - 2635.08] go then I can do the same thing here I
[2632.60 - 2638.48] can actually fillet the skin with the
[2635.08 - 2641.20] spoon the spoon facing
[2638.48 - 2643.64] up now I cut that skin so that one's a
[2641.20 - 2647.60] little weird there so it is what it is
[2643.64 - 2650.08] but there you go so right now I have
[2647.60 - 2652.16] that set up now I like to do shot
[2650.08 - 2653.40] glasses put it in shot glasses it's one
[2652.16 - 2654.84] option right there what I have right
[2653.40 - 2656.68] here is a shot glass in front of me
[2654.84 - 2659.60] check this
[2656.68 - 2662.36] out that's one option the other option
[2659.60 - 2664.52] is I just like to eat it with a spoon
[2662.36 - 2667.00] that's what people should do they should
[2664.52 - 2669.72] learn to eat it with a spoon
[2667.00 - 2671.08] the aloe water is a great way to do it
[2669.72 - 2674.72] and I'm going to show you how to make
[2671.08 - 2679.12] that in a little while but I challenge
[2674.72 - 2680.64] you to learn how to consume this in the
[2679.12 - 2685.32] most potent
[2680.64 - 2688.04] way the most potent way is not in the
[2685.32 - 2690.92] water that's not the most powerful way
[2688.04 - 2693.52] to use it to heal and to use it as a
[2690.92 - 2697.12] powerful healing tool no the most
[2693.52 - 2700.60] powerful way is eating a shrink
[2697.12 - 2702.56] right here eating it straight so you
[2700.60 - 2706.64] take the
[2702.56 - 2709.36] spoon and you go down and you scoop it
[2706.64 - 2712.04] right off like that and that's the most
[2709.36 - 2715.28] the best way to eat it is this way and
[2712.04 - 2715.28] that's the most powerful
[2716.00 - 2719.00] way
[2719.40 - 2724.24] yeah H to taste really good if you don't
[2722.80 - 2727.08] like the taste of
[2724.24 - 2728.84] aloe over time you'll learn about it and
[2727.08 - 2731.44] mean mean sorry over time you'll
[2728.84 - 2734.16] acclimate to the flavor and you'll start
[2731.44 - 2735.80] to enjoy it and you'll start liking it
[2734.16 - 2737.68] now I'm going to put in a shot glass now
[2735.80 - 2740.16] you got the shot glass right
[2737.68 - 2742.68] here so I'm going to take this next
[2740.16 - 2744.60] piece with a
[2742.68 - 2748.92] spoon and I'm going to put it in the
[2744.60 - 2751.76] shot glass just like that now you can
[2748.92 - 2753.76] actually scrape down to the skin and get
[2751.76 - 2756.88] a little bit more but remember this the
[2753.76 - 2758.08] closer you get to the skin the more
[2756.88 - 2762.44] bitter it
[2758.08 - 2765.32] is like medicine bitter so the closer
[2762.44 - 2768.32] you get to the skin to get the aloe and
[2765.32 - 2769.68] I do that I scrape it down to the skin
[2768.32 - 2771.28] but I know that a lot of people aren't
[2769.68 - 2774.32] going to like that because it's going to
[2771.28 - 2777.28] have like what feels like a nasty
[2774.32 - 2779.12] taste when it's down to the skin so you
[2777.28 - 2782.56] can you don't have to do that you don't
[2779.12 - 2785.12] have to scrape it down you just
[2782.56 - 2787.16] don't but what you do is you can make a
[2785.12 - 2789.60] shot glass right here you can put them
[2787.16 - 2791.44] in the fridge and you can have it set up
[2789.60 - 2794.24] so when you're doing medical medium aloe
[2791.44 - 2796.84] vera shock therapy and you're doing it
[2794.24 - 2796.84] every two
[2797.72 - 2802.80] hours you're doing it every four hours
[2801.00 - 2804.76] you can actually just have it in shot
[2802.80 - 2806.80] glasses prepared ready just like this so
[2804.76 - 2809.16] I'm going to move this over just's cut
[2806.80 - 2809.16] another
[2810.24 - 2814.92] piece
[2812.04 - 2816.64] okay all right now couple of things to
[2814.92 - 2819.16] know
[2816.64 - 2821.96] As you move down this
[2819.16 - 2824.68] Leaf it's going to turn pink or red so
[2821.96 - 2827.56] if you keep this in your fridge it's in
[2824.68 - 2829.84] there for a long time the aloe leaf will
[2827.56 - 2832.80] eventually start to oxidize and it'll
[2829.84 - 2835.48] start turning pink or red and it usually
[2832.80 - 2836.96] turns pink or red down by the tail in
[2835.48 - 2839.28] the lower
[2836.96 - 2841.52] sections so if you're you're trying to
[2839.28 - 2843.32] keep the aloe around longer for like a
[2841.52 - 2844.76] week in the fridge or two weeks in the
[2843.32 - 2846.44] fridge or something like that you might
[2844.76 - 2849.76] want to start eating from bottom up
[2846.44 - 2852.40] believe it or not where you cut the tail
[2849.76 - 2854.72] off discard that cuz that's hard to
[2852.40 - 2856.28] really get that aloe out unless you
[2854.72 - 2861.00] squeeze it out and you use it for
[2856.28 - 2863.32] something for skin or so forth
[2861.00 - 2866.72] right all right so let's go let's cut
[2863.32 - 2869.80] another piece now 2 in you can do a 4 in
[2866.72 - 2874.12] now I like bigger pieces like
[2869.80 - 2876.16] this right there see that I like a nice
[2874.12 - 2878.64] big piece like that so I'll show you one
[2876.16 - 2881.80] more time how to do this and we'll pop
[2878.64 - 2884.40] this in the
[2881.80 - 2886.48] blender so I'm going to take the knife
[2884.40 - 2888.00] and I'm going to cut right here on top
[2886.48 - 2891.16] I'm not going to cut deep I'm not going
[2888.00 - 2893.92] to go like that okay I'm going to cut
[2891.16 - 2896.20] right on the top just the
[2893.92 - 2900.84] surface like
[2896.20 - 2905.84] this open it up just like that take a
[2900.84 - 2908.28] look right once again you take the spoon
[2905.84 - 2910.04] face the spoon up this is the best way
[2908.28 - 2912.92] to do it I promise you this is the best
[2910.04 - 2916.08] way to do it when you play with aloe
[2912.92 - 2917.44] this is the only way to do it take the
[2916.08 - 2920.32] spoon facing
[2917.44 - 2922.64] up and you follow the skin like this
[2920.32 - 2922.64] there you
[2922.68 - 2928.32] go right on down it doesn't get any
[2926.12 - 2932.96] better than that that's the way you
[2928.32 - 2936.52] fillet a fish an aloe fish it's not a
[2932.96 - 2938.08] fish and then I'll get the other side
[2936.52 - 2941.96] right
[2938.08 - 2941.96] now once you learn
[2943.16 - 2949.16] this there you go that's how you fillet
[2946.96 - 2951.16] aloe vera right there until this day
[2949.16 - 2955.68] I've never seen anybody do it that way
[2951.16 - 2955.68] out there never seen it
[2956.88 - 2963.84] ever and it's the best way by far to do
[2960.28 - 2963.84] it so let's go into this a little
[2964.00 - 2969.28] bit um
[2967.36 - 2972.00] so let's talk about like how often to
[2969.28 - 2974.52] eat it and so forth medical medium Aliva
[2972.00 - 2977.84] shock therapy directions in protocols

[3001.12 - 3008.68] to 4 in a fresh Alo vera gel skin
[3004.80 - 3011.12] removed you saw how I did that every two
[3008.68 - 3013.08] to four waking hours so you wake up in
[3011.12 - 3017.20] the morning you
[3013.08 - 3021.08] start every 2 to four waking
[3017.20 - 3024.52] hours this is for a cute attacks people
[3021.08 - 3025.80] got a a cute gallbladder spasm a cute
[3024.52 - 3027.16] maybe they're going to the doctor all
[3025.80 - 3028.92] the time the doctor's like you you're
[3027.16 - 3030.80] having gallbladder problems come back

[3030.80 - 3034.52] out we'll take a look at your
[3032.60 - 3038.08] gallbladder and you're having these
[3034.52 - 3040.00] acute attacks or chronic ones this is
[3038.08 - 3041.48] when you can do you can do an aloe vera
[3040.00 - 3045.36] shock therapy and you can really take
[3041.48 - 3047.16] this on if your doctor allows it ask
[3045.36 - 3051.44] your doctor what's right for
[3047.16 - 3056.88] you okay continue this therapy for 1 to
[3051.44 - 3060.24] 7 days you can do aloe ver shock therapy
[3056.88 - 3060.24] anywhere from 1 to 7
[3060.40 - 3065.36] days I have helped so many people over
[3063.04 - 3068.88] the years with aloe vera shock
[3065.36 - 3072.52] therapy having them eat the the the
[3068.88 - 3074.04] shock therapy aloe after meals so I'm
[3072.52 - 3077.80] going to talk about that area too let's
[3074.04 - 3079.88] go into it after three or four days off
[3077.80 - 3083.24] elevator shock therapy you're welcome to
[3079.88 - 3085.44] cycle through 1 to 7 days again so if
[3083.24 - 3088.36] you're somebody and you're doing your
[3085.44 - 3091.76] first day you do it for 7 days you can
[3088.36 - 3093.04] take a few days off cycle again for
[3091.76 - 3096.04] another 7
[3093.04 - 3099.16] days you can do two or more inches of
[3096.04 - 3101.20] fresh aloe vera gel daily or twice a
[3099.16 - 3104.28] week it's another thing too you don't
[3101.20 - 3106.20] have to do the shock therapy where
[3104.28 - 3108.12] you're in this crisis or you want to do
[3106.20 - 3110.28] it every 2 to 4 hours cuz you're in this
[3108.12 - 3112.36] crisis you're really inflamed maybe
[3110.28 - 3115.08] you're somebody with colitis and you had
[3112.36 - 3117.88] a relapse with your colitis and it
[3115.08 - 3119.84] you're so inflamed and you're suffering
[3117.88 - 3121.20] that could be a time to do also the the
[3119.84 - 3123.72] shock therapy you could do the shock
[3121.20 - 3125.84] therapy you're somebody with chronic
[3123.72 - 3128.60] gastritis but you're welcome just to do
[3125.84 - 3132.20] it daily where you buy aloe and you're
[3128.60 - 3136.96] doing a piece of aloe every single day 2
[3132.20 - 3139.04] oz every single day okay to prepare the
[3136.96 - 3141.12] aloe gel carefully slice open your 2 to
[3139.04 - 3144.04] 4 inch piece of aloe vera leaf I love
[3141.12 - 3146.32] how the directions are actually in here
[3144.04 - 3148.68] trimming away the green spikes now what
[3146.32 - 3150.48] you'll see is I did not trim away the
[3148.68 - 3152.72] green
[3150.48 - 3154.44] spikes you might be somebody where you
[3152.72 - 3156.52] actually know kind of like to stay away
[3154.44 - 3158.84] from these you just don't don't grab it
[3156.52 - 3161.44] like squeeze on the spikes or anything
[3158.84 - 3163.56] like that and you'll see um I'll show
[3161.44 - 3166.72] you twoo like this these spikes some of
[3163.56 - 3168.64] them are just razor sharp like a cactus
[3166.72 - 3170.52] I mean they're just really sharp some
[3168.64 - 3173.76] are kind of dll these are a little bit
[3170.52 - 3177.52] more dull on the dull side but
[3173.76 - 3179.44] anyway make sure you do not use the skin
[3177.52 - 3181.40] as you're scooping out the Alo gel try
[3179.44 - 3184.16] not to scrape to the skin like I taught
[3181.40 - 3186.20] you before the chemical compound in the
[3184.16 - 3188.36] green skin can be irritating for some
[3186.20 - 3189.68] people so you don't want to eat the skin
[3188.36 - 3191.12] I can't tell you how many people I'm
[3189.68 - 3193.28] like you got to do some aloe it's going
[3191.12 - 3195.12] to really help and they take the skin
[3193.28 - 3197.56] and everything they throw it in the
[3195.12 - 3199.28] blender and then I think even somebody
[3197.56 - 3200.84] on social like I don't know if it was a
[3199.28 - 3202.28] year ago or two years ago they were
[3200.84 - 3204.00] showing people how to eat aloe or
[3202.28 - 3206.20] something it was like a chef and they
[3204.00 - 3208.52] just threw the whole leaf in the blender
[3206.20 - 3213.08] skin in all and spikes in all and I was
[3208.52 - 3215.56] like oh man I was like holy crap that's
[3213.08 - 3217.88] not good I I feel bad for anybody eating
[3215.56 - 3219.36] that right there I was like oh my God I
[3217.88 - 3220.60] mean I was scared for people because it
[3219.36 - 3222.80] could be
[3220.60 - 3224.12] irritating I was I was just don't know
[3222.80 - 3227.84] why people do
[3224.12 - 3229.64] that and eat the gel straight if
[3227.84 - 3232.76] possible for best results but if you
[3229.64 - 3237.88] have to put it in the fridge in a shot
[3232.76 - 3237.88] glass or a little glass bowl you can do
[3238.92 - 3244.00] that remember cut off the very edge as I
[3242.20 - 3244.80] talked about and discard that it's way
[3244.00 - 3247.20] too
[3244.80 - 3248.76] bitter okay so that's some of the tips
[3247.20 - 3250.88] right here which are really cool you're
[3248.76 - 3253.60] welcome to prepare all of your aloe gel
[3250.88 - 3255.56] for the day at once you can do that as
[3253.60 - 3257.08] well put it in airtight airtight
[3255.56 - 3259.60] container in the
[3257.08 - 3262.24] fridge if you're storing a partial Leaf
[3259.60 - 3264.08] wrap the cut end in a damp towel or
[3262.24 - 3266.16] plastic wrap if you really want and
[3264.08 - 3269.96] place it in the refrigerator avoid Alo
[3266.16 - 3274.28] leaves where the gel is very red inside
[3269.96 - 3277.64] like tomato red inside okay it's
[3274.28 - 3279.64] oxidized it's just going bad so keep
[3277.64 - 3282.08] that in mind these leaves aren't fresh
[3279.64 - 3284.52] they're starting to Decay when doing the
[3282.08 - 3287.48] aloe vera shock therapy eat it straight
[3284.52 - 3289.96] or Blended in water do not add to
[3287.48 - 3292.32] smoothies it doesn't work the same when
[3289.96 - 3293.76] it's added to smoothies very important
[3292.32 - 3296.08] piece of
[3293.76 - 3296.84] information all right
[3296.08 - 3299.56] let's
[3296.84 - 3304.68] roll a little bit
[3299.56 - 3307.96] here get this uh blender over here for a
[3304.68 - 3311.64] moment yep plugged in ready to
[3307.96 - 3311.64] roll let's scoop some
[3312.28 - 3316.60] aloe make some aloe water you can do it
[3314.84 - 3319.96] this way I love it this way too don't
[3316.60 - 3326.28] get me wrong it's the second best option
[3319.96 - 3327.68] versus eating it keep that in mind nice
[3326.28 - 3331.60] it's getting
[3327.68 - 3334.84] slippery but that's just how the story
[3331.60 - 3334.84] goes all
[3336.12 - 3341.76] right we got that in there let's add
[3339.52 - 3341.76] some
[3341.96 - 3348.12] water up to you on how much water you
[3344.28 - 3348.12] want to add I don't like adding a
[3350.00 - 3353.00] lot
[3354.00 - 3359.52] so
[3357.00 - 3361.72] all right that's
[3359.52 - 3363.52] good you don't want to like fill your
[3361.72 - 3366.56] blender like this High unless you have a
[3363.52 - 3368.52] lot of aloe in there that's 4 in a
[3366.56 - 3370.92] little bit more it's a really healthy
[3368.52 - 3370.92] size
[3371.60 - 3375.76] Leaf run let's
[3383.92 - 3386.92] go

[3430.00 - 3433.60] there it
[3430.92 - 3436.76] is now a lot of people would prefer this
[3433.60 - 3439.64] they don't want the slimy texture of the
[3436.76 - 3443.76] aloe they feel like it's too slimy it's
[3439.64 - 3445.48] too um it's gross some people will just
[3443.76 - 3447.72] think it's just gross
[3445.48 - 3451.40] but the most powerful way to consume it
[3447.72 - 3454.48] and eat it is like I was showing you
[3451.40 - 3457.04] before taking it scooping it right out
[3454.48 - 3459.16] eating it direct let's go into like when
[3457.04 - 3461.20] to eat it after meals if you're somebody
[3459.16 - 3464.44] that suffers with digestive problems
[3461.20 - 3466.80] after they eat acid reflux gastric pain
[3464.44 - 3468.28] bloating maybe burning in the stomach
[3466.80 - 3470.08] that's a really good one too A lot of
[3468.28 - 3471.32] people have ulcers or they're just
[3470.08 - 3473.36] burning in the stomach because their
[3471.32 - 3475.76] nerves are on fire because they're
[3473.36 - 3477.72] inflamed so their intest inal nerves and
[3475.76 - 3480.24] the nerves around their stomach are just
[3477.72 - 3482.04] hotwired because they're inflamed and
[3480.24 - 3484.28] because of that they're going to feel
[3482.04 - 3486.36] like burning instantly or there's
[3484.28 - 3488.76] somebody that's dealing with H pylori
[3486.36 - 3491.20] they got mini ulcers that aren't even
[3488.76 - 3494.48] detectable with an endoscopy not even
[3491.20 - 3496.16] detectable in any way shape or form
[3494.48 - 3498.40] maybe an ultrasound doesn't show
[3496.16 - 3501.76] anything and they just have burning it's
[3498.40 - 3503.96] mysterious burning going on that means
[3501.76 - 3506.16] that you could have these little micro
[3503.96 - 3508.60] Fishers they're just undetectable
[3506.16 - 3510.76] they're really tiny from H pylori from
[3508.60 - 3512.44] strep bacteria from different varieties
[3510.76 - 3515.68] of bacteria in the gut and when that's
[3512.44 - 3517.56] happening okay even viruses too like
[3515.68 - 3522.48] viruses that are behind
[3517.56 - 3525.64] colitis either way eating aloe directly
[3522.48 - 3527.28] after eating food is an option so if you
[3525.64 - 3530.04] had a meal of some kind whatever that
[3527.28 - 3532.56] meal is do aloe if you had a melon do
[3530.04 - 3535.80] aloe after melon if you had bananas do
[3532.56 - 3537.08] melon do do aloe after banana Bas if you
[3535.80 - 3541.76] had
[3537.08 - 3543.12] apples do um your aloe after your apples
[3541.76 - 3546.48] or maybe you had something else maybe
[3543.12 - 3549.60] you had avocado maybe you had a salad
[3546.48 - 3551.92] maybe you had fish maybe you had chicken
[3549.60 - 3553.72] maybe you had a steak whatever it is
[3551.92 - 3557.20] that you're eating and you got stomach
[3553.72 - 3559.64] problems have the aloe directly after or
[3557.20 - 3562.40] 20 minutes after or half an hour after
[3559.64 - 3564.76] and if you're experiencing gas pains or
[3562.40 - 3567.12] any kind kind of other issues you can do
[3564.76 - 3569.60] aloe then too doesn't even have to be
[3567.12 - 3571.52] after you eat directly it could be when
[3569.60 - 3573.32] you're experiencing a problem in the
[3571.52 - 3575.92] moment maybe you're somebody where
[3573.32 - 3579.28] you're bellowed over you're just in pain

[3770.72 - 3775.44] excited I'm taking a shortcut I'm using
[3773.04 - 3777.48] steamed potatoes the recipe calls for
[3775.44 - 3779.96] raw
[3777.48 - 3781.68] potatoes I'm taking a shortcut because I
[3779.96 - 3785.04] wanted to first of all I had steamed
[3781.68 - 3786.52] potatoes on hand second of all you know
[3785.04 - 3788.56] we're just you know we're spending a lot

[3790.56 - 3795.24] move these over a little
[3792.68 - 3797.08] bit let's make this happen got some
[3795.24 - 3800.48] potatoes right here look at the size of
[3797.08 - 3803.12] this potato this is crazy let's cut this
[3800.48 - 3806.28] up I'm going to like do a little cubing
[3803.12 - 3810.80] on this so what I'm going to do is I'm
[3806.28 - 3813.08] going to cut it in half like that maybe
[3810.80 - 3815.44] another here like
[3813.08 - 3817.80] that I'm just going along with the
[3815.44 - 3819.48] program here in the sense like you know
[3817.80 - 3822.08] what I want them cubed so let me go
[3819.48 - 3825.88] along with naturally happens right here
[3822.08 - 3828.36] so then I'm going to cut it like
[3825.88 - 3832.60] this cut it like

[3859.72 - 3866.04] right okay here we go see this like
[3863.32 - 3868.48] little cubes now if it was a raw potato
[3866.04 - 3871.60] those cubes would be like hard they
[3868.48 - 3872.72] would be solid so you you have to
[3871.60 - 3875.16] understand this is going to be a little
[3872.72 - 3877.64] bit Messier because it's a steamed

[3987.24 - 3991.16] you'll never be able to explain it to
[3989.00 - 3992.72] somebody else like you can tell people
[3991.16 - 3995.60] and they'll just they'll just look at

[4015.08 - 4021.36] it unless you really know what it's like
[4018.08 - 4021.36] okay we're going to cut another one
[4021.44 - 4025.84] here let you know what it's like it's
[4024.00 - 4028.32] hard to explain to somebody like yeah I
[4025.84 - 4031.20] have intestinal tract problems I can't
[4028.32 - 4033.92] go to bathroom or I got the runs all the
[4031.20 - 4037.32] time and I'm really struggling and I'm
[4033.92 - 4040.40] in pain I'm gastric you my my system's
[4037.32 - 4043.00] so screwed up and people are
[4040.40 - 4044.92] like they look at you and be like well I
[4043.00 - 4047.96] I had food poison at some point that's
[4044.92 - 4049.88] the only way I can reference it that's
[4047.96 - 4052.92] another thing too aloe vera shock
[4049.88 - 4055.80] therapy for food poisoning recovery
[4052.92 - 4057.20] chemical sensitive people when people
[4055.80 - 4058.56] are chemical sensitive they're afraid to
[4057.20 - 4061.04] do anything they're afraid to take
[4058.56 - 4064.00] anything they're just so nervous they're
[4061.04 - 4067.16] so scared and they do aloe
[4064.00 - 4070.36] vera it's so gentle on them probably one
[4067.16 - 4072.56] of the most gentlest powerful way for
[4070.36 - 4074.32] somebody who's chemical sensitive they
[4072.56 - 4076.08] got food sensitivities it's it's another
[4074.32 - 4078.52] thing too but the problem is a food
[4076.08 - 4080.16] sensitivi is you go to a doctor you get
[4078.52 - 4082.44] the allat or you get like a food
[4080.16 - 4084.16] sensitivity scan next thing you know it

[4085.76 - 4088.68] aloe vera before they're like yep you're
[4087.32 - 4091.44] sensitive to it then you lose an
[4088.68 - 4091.44] opportunity to
[4093.60 - 4098.16] heal I'm going to be using spices today

[4104.56 - 4110.92] okay um if you're sensitive in any way
[4107.52 - 4113.44] you can leave the spices out all right

[5340.68 - 5345.64] information the health movement has
[5342.80 - 5348.12] changed because of mm info it is not

[5386.60 - 5389.16] and everything
[5389.56 - 5393.36] else and the reason why they talk about
[5391.80 - 5395.76] the the liver now is because of the
[5393.36 - 5397.68] infamous Liver Rescue book that has gone
[5395.76 - 5400.72] around the globe published in almost
