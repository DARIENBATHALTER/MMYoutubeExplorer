00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,040
hello I'm Anthony William and you're

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,920
listening to the medical medium radio

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,040
show where each week I talk about the

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,000
most advanced healing information and

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
secrets about health much of which is

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,640
not found anywhere else and is decades

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,080
ahead of what's out there now as I've

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,359
always said who is 10 or 20 30 years to

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,080
wait for answers to their illnesses life

10
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,960
is precious this is the only Health show

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,480
out there today where the information

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,679
here doesn't come from any interest

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,879
groups medical funding with strings

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,879
attached botched research research with

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,200
the thumb put on the scale to make

16
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:42,680
things turn out the way they need to be

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
spun research spun information lobbyist

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,160
internal Kickbacks persuaded belief

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,879
systems because when we fall into a

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,520
belief system it can't be broken so no

21
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,640
matter what happens it's where someone

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,559
forges ahead forges ahead and they don't

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,879
open their minds for something else

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,440
private panels of influencers and health

25
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,600
field payoffs and trendy traps you don't

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,519
think that stuff's out there in

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,080
alternative medicine it's saturated it's

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,360
something that spirit and I have had to

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,799
deal with for years and years and years

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,119
it's nobody's fault it's nobody's fault

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,840
and meaning in the sense that people you

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,520
know they pick up information you find

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,720
on the internet and you find in other

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
places whatever and and you know you

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,759
think this information is what is going

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,240
on out there and then it gets trendy or

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,000
catchy and all these things happen but

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,600
what happens is that

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,439
information has been tampered with along

40
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,759
the way all along the way starting from

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
the very beginning and it just gets more

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,560
tampered more tampered one way or

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,119
another all the health information I

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,399
share here comes from a pure untampered

45
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,640
with Advanced Clean Source a higher

46
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,439
source the spirit of compassion there's

47
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,479
nothing more healing than compassion

48
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:59,039
there's nothing more healing you know

49
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,200
someone said to me the other day look I

50
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,680
hear you got kind of like like a new

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,039
opening in the show where you talk about

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,759
where the information comes from and

53
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,200
everything else why are you doing that

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,039
and I said because some people who are

55
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,160
new come on to the show meaning they

56
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,080
they they log on to the show and they

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,560
just think it's the same old stuff they

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,480
don't even give it they don't even like

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,160
really listen to it they think it's

60
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,160
maybe the same old stuff that's going

61
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,360
around now that every expert knows or or

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,080
that experts you know created or experts

63
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,040
know or something or science has to

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,360
offer or whatever and then experts and

65
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,879
they and they think it's that oh wait a

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,280
minute and they don't realize they don't

67
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:36,080
realize that the information here has

68
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,120
been different all along going all the

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,599
way back to our first show and it's

70
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,680
always been like that including in the

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,599
books and it's important to know it's

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
not something that should just be you

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,879
know and I was telling this person it's

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,000
not something that should just be

75
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,480
ignored because someone has to be aware

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,120
of what's going on conventional medicine

77
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,040
we all know a conventional medicine and

78
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,040
chronic illness has so many problems I

79
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,920
mean so many problems it's

80
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,480
unbelievable and we know that that but

81
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,599
alternative medicine has so many

82
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,080
problems too with with chronic illness

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,319
it's unbelievable and it's not the

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,159
doctors you I have I I know so many

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,560
doctors amazing people without them we

86
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,239
can't live it's like that song Can't

87
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,080
Live living without you or whatever that

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,760
it's like you can't live without them

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,920
because um there's so many life-saving

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
things that are out there now and

91
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,560
life-saving techniques and and

92
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,560
life-saving Equipment being invented yes

93
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,640
by science but chronic

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,080
illness is a whole another place it's

95
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,720
for some reason it's not it's not

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,599
separated properly like for some reason

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,239
there's serious medical Denial in

98
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,959
conventional medicine and you know I

99
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,480
mean even in summon alternative medicine

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,519
thank God alternative medicine became

101
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,640
more open to that that's the whole point

102
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,920
yeah I got to tell you something if you

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,959
go back in time just a little bit I hate

104
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,040
giving everybody like this like history

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
stuff but I can't help it it's

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,439
interesting if you go back excuse me if

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,280
you go back a little bit in time maybe

108
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,680
the

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,400
80s and and you wouldn't believe how

110
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,959
separated alternative and conventional

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
was I can't even tell you look maybe

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,239
some of you already know that out there

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
maybe the younger people coming on

114
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,479
listening logging on to the show they

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,840
don't know this they they they they

116
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:28,199
think that it's always been kind of

117
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,000
functionally put together where you go

118
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,600
to your functional doctor you go to a

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
clinic that has alternative and

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,720
conventional and they're both working

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,039
side by side that didn't

122
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,639
exist um alternative medicine was the

123
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,320
enemy the enemy to Conventional medicine

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,000
the hatred was

125
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,440
unbelievable it was a war it was a war

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,280
it's no joke conventional

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,320
doctors they I mean literally would

128
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,240
dispel the slightest remedy you walk

129
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,800
into a drugstore Pharmacy you wouldn't

130
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,600
find real vitamins there you wouldn't

131
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,240
find eona golden seal you wouldn't find

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,160
anything there it didn't exist and if

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,039
you ask the pharmacist about and say hey

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,479
I heard golden seal is really helpful

135
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,520
for something if you did that where's

136
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,280
the golden seal they look at you like

137
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,280
you had 10 heads on and you know so the

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,280
deal is here that the things you know

139
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,520
times have changed but what turned

140
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,880
alternative medicine into something was

141
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,759
that millions of people with chronic

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,960
illness chronic

143
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:37,639
illness with no answers were so fed up

144
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,680
so fed up with going to their doctor

145
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,680
being told they're insane being told

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
they're lazy be being told there's

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,319
something wrong I mean with them

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,120
emotionally mentally and that their

149
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,240
symptoms were in their head and you know

150
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,840
it was a really hard time and still is

151
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,160
now today I talk about some of that that

152
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,400
I've never talked about actually before

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,120
in the other books in the thyroid book

154
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
and so

155
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,919
conventional medicine was this place

156
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,759
where when it came down to Chronic

157
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,680
mystery illness forget it forget it and

158
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,680
so you know hey the door was open it was

159
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,280
open right at the beginning of the 80s

160
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,199
right there late' 70s early ' 80s it's

161
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,520
when alternative medicine was actually

162
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,759
when people were filing in women mostly

163
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,520
were filing into offices naturopaths the

164
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,080
first naturopath in California the very

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,720
first and other naturopaths that came

166
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,880
after that and you know on the east

167
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,039
coast and you couldn't find a naturopath

168
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,000
in the in the uh middle of the country

169
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,520
in the middle of the country you

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,560
couldn't find you just couldn't find

171
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,039
them you couldn't find a herbalist in

172
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,000
the middle of the country I mean good

173
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,240
luck in that time time period it's

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,639
really a hard time that was happening

175
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,560
and you know so what happened was people

176
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,440
were filing in and the only answer

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,360
really alternative medicine had back in

178
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,360
1980 for anybody with any mystery

179
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,280
symptom is it's it's your it's candida

183
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:10,160
bless them you know because it gave

184
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:13,599
something it gave an answer to some

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,840
degree to what to to anything to

186
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,160
anything to knowing to knowing that

187
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,199
there's something else going on there's

188
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,520
something else going on that they're not

189
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,599
crazy that all these women are not

190
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,960
insane that they actually have some

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,360
symptoms and something's wrong and you

192
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,120
just can't be throwing antibiotics at

193
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,680
them 24/7 and steroids because that's

194
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,240
it's still all we have today and

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,479
conventional medicine to deal with

196
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,000
something that's critical or something

197
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,440
that's you know coming you know out a

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,360
little bit out of control whatever it is

199
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,120
just antibiotics and steroids oh

200
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,319
immunosuppressive drugs which is kind of

201
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
you know almost many of them are in the

202
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,680
steroid category or whatever but it's

203
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,759
just it's a combination it's like

204
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,800
biologics or Amun suppressives or now

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,479
you know steroids and any biotics that's

206
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,639
all we got and so women were getting

207
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:08,720
answers it was

208
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,520
candida and you know and yeah that's the

209
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,319
candida that was the whole candida craze

210
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,000
that started that's it took quite a

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,720
while to catch on finally and get to the

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
'90s and then finally get to then

213
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,199
everybody was getting diagnosed the

214
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,080
candida left and right now you know it's

215
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,080
sibo sibo that's the craze it's sibo

216
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,680
it's sibo hey leaky gut leaky gut leaky

217
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
gut that's a crazy which leaky gut's a

218
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
whole big confusion we talked about that

219
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,839
already in one of the shows I'll do more

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,240
about that that's information is still

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,719
off on that still off on sio we talked

222
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,880
about that in the sibo show and candida

223
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,839
especially candida because just just as

224
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,040
a reminder we can't live without candida

225
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
we're not saying we can't live without

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,200
doctors we can't live without candida

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,839
you die if you have no candida we die

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,279
we're we're gone we're gone we don't

229
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,480
live I mean we'll just

230
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,959
literally we won't be living like you

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
and I'm serious about that you have

232
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,680
first of all you can't get rid of all

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,920
your candid it's impossible no matter

234
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,040
how many cleanses and everything else

235
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,560
you do thank God thank God CU if you did

236
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,920
get rid of all your candida You' die

237
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,760
okay because that's that's what keeps us

238
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,680
alive that's a neutral fungus that does

239
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
all kinds of Miracles for us internally

240
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,160
and when it grows out of control that's

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,560
because something it's actually helping

242
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,600
you it's cleaning up a mess another

243
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,200
problem so that's a whole thing and you

244
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
won't find that information anywhere and

245
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,720
if you do it's because I I put that out

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
there and that's what I mean and it's

247
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,680
not about me being smart it's about the

248
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,120
information coming from that clean

249
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,800
Source spirit and and that's that's you

250
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,880
know that's what it's about and and the

251
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,160
deal is is that you know people were

252
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,920
pouring in being told that they had

253
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,079
candida and the conventional doctors

254
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,200
were like they were like that's in

255
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,120
that's insane conventional doctors were

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
like you know whatever this craze is but

257
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,959
women were being hurt heard and it was

258
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,120
so important you know we talk about all

259
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,640
these different things women's rights

260
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,360
and all these different ways but in

261
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,160
chronic illness oh my God it's been

262
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,640
terrifying

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,880
terrifying and so it's better now but

264
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,560
the problem is now that every single

265
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,200
person who has a symptom and who gets

266
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,000
sick gets diagnosed with Lyme disease

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,920
whether they like it or not and that's a

268
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,640
tragedy all all on its own absolute

269
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,040
tragedy and you can't it's hard to argue

270
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,680
it's hard to argue and even if even if

271
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,200
the information I talk about is 100%

272
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,079
right on to what's really going on it's

273
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,800
impossible to battle it out there it's

274
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,800
almost impossible because it's just it's

275
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,800
it's so ingrained it's been bred into

276
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
our psyche through our pets to begin

277
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,000
with with Lyme disease and then and then

278
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,440
through us it's been

279
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,959
unbelievable of what's going on so every

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,639
single I I'll tell you I'll give you a

281
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,120
prediction right now 10 more years 15

282
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:59,279
more years everybody's going to have

283
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,399
Lyme disease that has a symptom or not

284
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,240
just going to the doctor and getting

285
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,360
some blood tests because there's there's

286
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,560
something totally 100% corrupted in the

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,160
system of medicine today alternatively

288
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,399
that's allowing for these Lyme disease

289
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,600
diagnoses to get out of control to this

290
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,040
degree if you just logged on and you

291
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,320
don't understand like meaning you're

292
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,160
you're like what's he talking about

293
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,240
what's he saying you know get book one

294
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,360
and read the lime chapter to begin with

295
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,279
just so you can get familiar with what's

296
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,399
really

297
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,040
happening and and I'm talking about this

298
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,240
because it starts like I said the

299
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,560
conventional here's okay here's the deal

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,160
so conventional and alternative medicine

301
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,480
they were separated they were separated

302
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,279
far apart they came together there's

303
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,120
some good things there's some bad things

304
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,560
there's some good bad and ugly about

305
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,279
that okay some good things are is thank

306
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,279
God we're all working together some bad

307
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,680
things are it's really brought in

308
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,959
exactly the Lyme disease craz now like

309
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,880
that was

310
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,600
conventional that was conventional

311
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,440
believe it or not even though you don't

312
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,000
think it was because conventional

313
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,240
doctors would ignore lime they would

314
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,959
ignore it no it was conventional it was

315
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,320
and it was conventionally founded and

316
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,519
conventional doctors didn't accept it so

317
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,920
it it made a confusion where wait a

318
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,760
minute maybe alternative medicine is is

319
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,760
responding to to Lyme disease more than

320
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,399
ever before so that's where and then but

321
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,880
really what happened was it was

322
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,720
conventionally founded

323
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,320
and then it was and then the

324
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,880
conventional you know doctors actually

325
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,120
the the medical system ignored it that

326
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,880
was a game that was a game that was a

327
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,079
game to rope everybody in to get the

328
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,160
confusion twisted and swirling out there

329
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,160
so that conventional alternative would

330
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,440
finally come together in the end to

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,199
where we are now and there's going to be

332
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,880
the Lyme disease craze like you've never

333
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:59,959
seen before in history ever in history

334
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:04,279
just 10 more years you won't believe

335
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:07,199
what you're going to see and how off it

336
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,240
really is unless we do something about

337
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,120
it and get real answers and do things

338
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,399
the way we need to do it but

339
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,920
conventional and alternative medicine

340
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,399
came together now you can get it in one

341
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,680
package and there's good things about

342
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,120
that really incredible things about it

343
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,880
because alternative medicine offers so

344
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,399
many great things incredible things and

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,760
um and the support and it has The

346
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:34,600
Compassion there's more compassion in it

347
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,560
you know nowadays than even there was

348
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,399
before and in and and it and it forces

349
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,519
the conventional model to have more

350
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,279
compassion than ever did before so

351
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,440
there's some beautiful wonderful things

352
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,839
that have occurred from having them join

353
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,480
together you know great things and then

354
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,399
you there's been more more opportunities

355
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,959
for both sides to to you know glean from

356
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,959
each other as well and that's been some

357
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,880
of the good things there's there's also

358
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,320
other bad things too but why why am I

359
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,639
kind of talking about the history a

360
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,120
little bit and where we're at now cuz

361
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,560
when it comes down to lupus which we're

362
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,880
going to get to that is one massive

363
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,240
confusion that's one massive confusion

364
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,680
and the reason why I'm even talking

365
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,600
about lime is because every single

366
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,680
person with lupus will be diagnosed with

367
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,839
lime even though they don't really have

368
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,399
it I'm just for warning just forewarning

369
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,920
you if you're a practitioner listening

370
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,079
to I'm just just just giving you the you

371
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,199
know the

372
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,120
411 that's just everybody with lupus is

373
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,600
going to be going to a lime doctor filed

374
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,920
into the lime trap every single one

375
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,800
eventually and there's there's going to

376
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,839
be something strange happening coming in

377
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,920
the next 10 years lupus diagnoses are

378
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,920
going to be

379
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,839
less they're going to be less even

380
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,560
though there's more people with symptoms

381
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
mystery symptoms that would have been

382
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,680
identified as lupus

383
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,880
originally but there's going to be less

384
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,360
diagnosis multiple

385
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,279
sclerosis um patients people with MS

386
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240
symptoms are going to be getting more

387
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,519
symptoms meaning more and more people

388
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,720
getting new found symptoms and of of Ms

389
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,360
but they're going to be diagnosed less

390
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,839
with Ms do you see because they're all

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,120
going to be funneled to the lime machine

392
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,199
the lime machine a trillion doll coming

393
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,720
up business the lime lime machine and um

394
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,120
and every every time you see a tick

395
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,319
you're just going to you're just you're

396
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,399
going to lose your breath

397
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,639
you you know and that's what's going to

398
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,680
happen and and the reason why I'm

399
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,399
talking about this is because we're

400
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,880
talking about lupus but it's lupus is

401
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
going to be outdated the diagnosis

402
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,480
itself is going to be outdated even

403
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,160
people who have been carrying that

404
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,720
diagnosis for 10 years already 15 years

405
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,279
they're going to be forced forced to

406
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,519
believe they have something else

407
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,399
even though lupus in itself is confusion

408
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,000
to begin with the diagnoses everything

409
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,000
about it's a mystery doctors don't even

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,120
know what really is lupus is it even

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,560
something at all even with all that it's

412
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,600
going to be less less and less of a

413
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,240
diagnosis and people who have already

414
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,160
had long-standing long-term lupus

415
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,759
identified in their medical records

416
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,440
they're going to be going to doctors and

417
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,079
doctors can be a look I just did a lime

418
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,600
test on you you got lime now maybe

419
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,000
that's what this has been the whole

420
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,000
whole time it's been lime this whole

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
time it no one talks about this no one

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,279
talks about the truth about anything

423
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,519
about this even you can alter medicine

424
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,120
listen to podcast or just no one's going

425
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:46,319
to any of this it's it's it it it blows

426
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,360
me away and maybe because they don't

427
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,920
have spirit and I got to remember that I

428
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,720
always have to remember that you know

429
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,199
Spirit even reminds me once in a while

430
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,720
and even even my family reminds me and

431
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:58,639
like remember you know you're just you

432
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,000
can't get all wound up because they they

433
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,959
don't have Spirit talking to them

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
telling them this so you can't get that

435
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,880
charged up you can't get charged up of

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,959
why everything's so slow and coming and

437
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,199
why it always gets twisted and turns and

438
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,079
goes in different in the wrong

439
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,199
directions out there in alternative Inc

440
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,520
conventional medicine

441
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,880
and and then somebody else will say well

442
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,799
you know that's crazy look what science

443
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,280
has to offer absolutely and I love it

444
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,720
I'm huge I'm a big science fan I'm a

445
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,160
science fan because I love Spirit

446
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,600
debunking it constantly it's fun that's

447
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,919
one of the reasons why I'm a fan the

448
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,360
other reason why is because a lot of

449
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,360
science is really gr but even the

450
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,880
mechanical stuff that's created by the

451
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,400
technology that's created by science

452
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,720
still there's problems everywhere look

453
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,280
at the hernia

454
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,960
mesh I mean look at the I mean it's just

455
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,880
one blunder after another and these are

456
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,840
things that have been weighed and

457
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,160
measured science is about weighing and

458
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,039
measuring you guys it's about weighing

459
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
and measuring that's what science is you

460
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,640
can't weit you can't measure it then

461
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,480
it's just a theory which if there's the

462
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
right funding in the right place then

463
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,400
that theory will take off and be

464
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,480
something they'll make that theory and

465
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,400
turn that theory into something because

466
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,520
it'll be funded and when people put

467
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,440
money in oh you don't want to piss them

468
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,600
off you don't want to piss off those

469
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,200
people who put big money into things so

470
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
you got to put your thumb on the scale

471
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,360
and make that theory into something oh

472
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,919
yeah no it did come out this okay let's

473
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,559
do it this this did come out this way

474
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:23,559
worry about the consequences later and

475
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,880
so so but but science is about weighing

476
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:27,320
and measuring it's about facts facts

477
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,760
that have been weighed and measured

478
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,919
perfectly and so there's things that we

479
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,600
create in science technology and and

480
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,640
physical things just they don't work out

481
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,919
you got they just don't they were weight

482
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,600
and measured they should have worked it

483
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,440
but they didn't even that has holes in

484
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,120
it why am I talking about all this again

485
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,480
because when it comes down to lupus it's

486
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,360
so so confusing and and it's a hard deal

487
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,080
it's a hard deal the way lupus came

488
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,280
about the way it was discovered the way

489
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,039
you know the way people like okay you

490
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,679
got rash you got fever we don't know

491
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,159
what it is you got lupus whether tests

492
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,400
show anything or they don't lupus has

493
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,440
been a tough one so I'm letting you know

494
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,640
it can't be weigh or measured lupus

495
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,320
can't be weigh or

496
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,799
measured it can't be weight or

497
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,000
measured even lime disease can't be

498
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:21,600
weight and measured it can't why do you

499
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,559
think people get a borderline listen if

500
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,240
you have a pathogen if you have say a

501
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,760
bacteria that's causing Lyme disease

502
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,919
it's either you have it or you're not or

503
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
you don't

504
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,039
so the best Labs the best newest labs in

505
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,880
the country say oh it's borderline it it

506
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,960
could be there it might not be there no

507
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,919
no if you have a

508
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,080
pathogen it's there or it's

509
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,360
not that's one of the greatest mistakes

510
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
they're going to change that cuz that's

511
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,159
a that's a

512
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,840
flaw that that is showing something's

513
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:53,400
wrong with the whole lime testing to

514
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
begin with and that's going to change

515
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,240
watch I guarantee you doctors won't be

516
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,679
getting tests coming back borderline

517
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,159
anymore because that's a massive mess up

518
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,679
all on its own that's happening they're

519
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,200
going to fix that they're going to fix

520
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,679
that because they know that that was

521
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,760
they shouldn't be saying that and you

522
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,480
know the thing is you know so weight and

523
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,360
measured lupus can't be weight and

524
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,039
measured chronic illness can't be weight

525
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,200
and

526
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:21,240
measured it can't be it can't be and so

527
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,000
this is this is where chronic

528
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,159
illness has to be separated and

529
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,400
respected it has to be respected and

530
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:33,440
separated from all the nonsense it

531
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,799
really does and it has to be it it

532
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,039
really something has to change and

533
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,360
that's what the shows about and uh and

534
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,799
the the decades and decades that put

535
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,600
into uh helping people and everything

536
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,880
else around it you know check out the

537
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,440
Instagram medical medium Instagram

538
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,960
because it's just it's so inspiring it

539
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,200
just constantly inspires me everybody

540
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,760
telling their stories of what they go

541
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,400
through what what's happening what

542
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
meaning their healing process what

543
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,679
they've been through and how they're

544
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:07,480
healing I it's it's incredible to watch

545
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,840
somebody reminded me recently a mom and

546
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,600
their child and and she said on

547
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,240
Instagram she said you know the all

548
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,919
storms pass everything changes and

549
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,600
nothing stays the same really helped her

550
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,120
to get through a hard time and in in

551
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,720
spirit you know Spirit gave me that a

552
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,039
long time ago all storms pass everything

553
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,679
Chang ches and nothing stays the same I

554
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,320
want to just talk about it for one

555
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,559
minute a couple minutes what does that

556
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,440
mean what is that about first of all

557
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,880
storms meaning whether it's a Health

558
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,440
crisis whether something's happening in

559
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,720
your family whether something's going on

560
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,799
whether you got stress whether it's

561
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,960
Financial terrible financial problems

562
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,360
whatever it is whatever is going on in

563
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,400
your life it's a

564
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,039
storm if you're sick it's a

565
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,279
storm and there's something to

566
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,760
understand that Spirit taught me doesn't

567
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:00,559
matter if the storm going on for 5 years

568
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,159
5

569
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,799
minutes 5 months 10 years it doesn't

570
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,039
matter how

571
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,679
long everything changes and nothing

572
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,960
stays the same it will change it will

573
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,799
pass this is something that can bring

574
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,120
you peace no matter what's happening in

575
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,559
your life it's brought me peace if I've

576
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,480
ever come across a storm because storms

577
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:27,000
don't Define us you have to know that

578
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,520
they don't Define who we are the storm

579
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,320
is not you

580
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,799
the storm is not

581
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,679
you that's what I'm saying the storm is

582
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:38,720
not you even if you're sick because

583
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,919
guess what if you're sick it's not your

584
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,240
fault it's not your fault you're sick

585
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,600
you didn't create it's not because

586
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,799
you're faulty it's not because you have

587
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,600
bad genes it's not because you're a bad

588
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,240
person that's that's not why you're

589
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,840
struggling with some kind of illness

590
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,360
something happened something happened

591
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,480
that medical science and research hasn't

592
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
figured out that's what I'm saying it

593
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,600
can't be weighted measured in chronic

594
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,600
illness that's not your

595
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,799
fault did anybody um listen to the uh

596
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,600
autoimmune autoimmune webinar I just did

597
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,480
I talked a little bit about that in the

598
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,240
webinar there's some webinars coming up

599
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,360
and you got to catch them you got to

600
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,880
catch them there's a few more

601
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,840
webinars um so all storms pass whether

602
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,120
we're going through hard times

603
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,919
hardships and whatever that is doesn't

604
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,159
matter what it is somebody's trying to

605
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,159
you know throw judgment on you so

606
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,799
whatever they're trying to do someone's

607
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,039
bullying you whatever is happening

608
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,799
everything changes and nothing stays the

609
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,320
same and you always have to remember

610
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:47,840
that and that storm isn't you it's not

611
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,679
you so if you're having a problem with a

612
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,960
a

613
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:56,799
coworker or or colleague or you can't

614
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,440
find work or whatever it is that's not

615
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,159
what defines you

616
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,640
it's not if you're sick it's not either

617
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,120
and and when we're sick we're always

618
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,159
it's always blamed on you it's always

619
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,960
blamed on you blamed on us we're sick

620
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,880
that's St you you you're obvious not

621
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,400
doing something right you're obviously

622
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,159
not doing something or you just got bad

623
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,960
genes if there's no answers you know or

624
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,840
you're just you know or it's autoimmune

625
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
your body's attacking itself oh my God

626
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,679
if I hear that one more time out there

627
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,960
and so so when we have these storms and

628
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,640
we have mystery

629
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,760
lupus it's not what defines you okay

630
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,520
it's not who you are something's

631
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,520
happening we're going to talk about it

632
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,159
and we've we've already probably talked

633
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,320
about it I know we talked about in book

634
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,000
one a little bit where lupus comes from

635
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm sure some of you are like oh yeah I

636
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,120
know where it is I know what it is where

637
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,320
it is in the book and the whole bit but

638
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,399
this is important to just understand

639
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,080
though about how it works it can't be

640
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:57,000
waiter measured it's a

641
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,399
storm and it's not you it's not your

642
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,600
fault that's just like that with

643
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,399
anything going on anyway the person that

644
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,679
reminded me if you go to Instagram and

645
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,120
you you you search through and

646
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,279
everything like that the mom that

647
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,159
reminded me about all storms pass um

648
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:15,880
things got better for her

649
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:18,000
child got better for her child and and

650
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,200
better for her and they're moving

651
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,360
they're moving past the storm like never

652
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,640
before and so it's just something to

653
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,960
think about it's something to think

654
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,360
about so um so let's talk about lupus

655
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,559
that's what it's about we're trying you

656
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,000
know I'm giving you this whole the

657
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,399
reason why this whole monologue is

658
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
happening right at the beginning this

659
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,919
really long monologue which you know

660
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,360
whatever is happening is because I'm

661
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,960
trying to prepare you because these are

662
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,080
the things going on especially with

663
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,720
someone with lupus is they get filed

664
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,799
into lime the lime trap like I talked

665
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,480
about earlier there there's going to be

666
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,679
less lupus diagnoses because everybody's

667
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,120
just going to put everybody into lime no

668
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,960
matter what it is and we can just we

669
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,520
could talk about all kinds of of of

670
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,360
different autoimmune and illnesses and

671
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,159
everything else so all right so lupus

672
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,480
the whole bit let just let's run down

673
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,679
some of the symptoms of

674
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,120
Lupus fatigue right chronic fatigue

675
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,720
depending on how serious somebody's

676
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,799
lupus is could be uh mild fatigue on

677
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,440
andof fatigue sometimes chronic joint

678
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,960
pain could have fevers no fevers could

679
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,520
be fevers for some people no fevers for

680
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,840
others um uh joint pain joint swelling

681
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,080
swelling

682
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,840
edema so edema which means swelling

683
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,679
ankles mysterious you know chronic

684
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,880
illness is all mysterious swelling

685
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,880
ankles swelling knees um fluid retention

686
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,159
the whole bit um some of you probably

687
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,399
like hey I got joint pain do I have

688
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,840
Lupus that's how ridiculous it is

689
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:52,320
because meaning not the pain not your

690
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,960
symptom not what's going on there you

691
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,640
totally validated that's not the problem

692
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,200
but if you went to a lupus specialist

693
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,279
yeah you'd probably get you know thrown

694
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,760
into a lupus category it's possible but

695
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,559
eventually like I said that's going to

696
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,159
be outdated everybody's going into lime

697
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,679
and don't get scared you don't have lime

698
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,080
um swelling hair

699
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,240
loss so that's another thing too that

700
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,399
occurs hair loss Rod's phenomenon right

701
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,039
Rod's phenomenon rod syndrome some

702
00:27:17,399 --> 00:27:21,159
people say in the whole bit that's the

703
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,360
discoloration of the uh hands or the

704
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:28,039
feet that whole thing uh rashes all over

705
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,559
the body that could be lupus um give

706
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,600
take um so these are some of the

707
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,039
symptoms these are some of the symptoms

708
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,919
let's cover these symptoms for a minute

709
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,000
let's talk about him for a little

710
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:44,080
bit um fatigue chronic fatigue that's

711
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,399
Epstein bar that's Epstein bar because

712
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,679
with with lupus you can get the white

713
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,559
count could be off it could be up it

714
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,640
could be down red red bullet cells down

715
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,720
that could happen or they could be

716
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
stabled and go down low platelets can

717
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,519
occur you could you may not have low

718
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,039
platelets May not have red blood cell

719
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,440
problems with lopus but you have white

720
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,559
blood cell issues it's all Epstein bar

721
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,760
right there it's all viral infection

722
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,480
viral infection to this day why aren't

723
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,919
the best medical doctors saying you have

724
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,760
a viral infection when you go to the

725
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,640
doctor you have these symptoms that's

726
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,679
what's supposed to be happening I'll

727
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,519
tell you why it's not because something

728
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:25,399
is just messed up in the system and it's

729
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,080
been messed up in the system and it's

730
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:30,440
not the doctor's fault it's not the

731
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,840
awesome amazing doctor's fault who's

732
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,799
dedicated their life to helping sick

733
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,080
people it's not their fault but there's

734
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,080
something terribly messed up in the

735
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,000
system it's legit seriously messed up

736
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,039
I'm serious for a long time now and

737
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,200
still going and not

738
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,919
stopping you walk into the doctor's

739
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,279
office and you got

740
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:58,279
fatigue and you got um

741
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:59,720
swelling you got a viral infection

742
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,080
you know I mean of course they can do

743
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,480
all the weighing and measuring they can

744
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,120
do some tests they can look for some

745
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,760
weird thing that happened you know what

746
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,159
happens too some people if they have a

747
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
cancer they never knew about sitting

748
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,840
inside of

749
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,840
them that will be blamed on

750
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,919
everything when it has nothing to do

751
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,640
with the whole thing they're going

752
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,600
through like nothing to do with the

753
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,679
symptoms they're going through at all

754
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,600
nothing to do with their fatigue at all

755
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,519
but if they find something cancer oh

756
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,320
this is this is it right here it's all

757
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:30,399
this it's another mistake made

758
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,600
constantly so um you know this this is

759
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,480
this is how it works so joint pain

760
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,360
fevers that are chronic up and down I

761
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,360
mean you walk into a doctor's office it

762
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
should be instant you got a viral

763
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,880
infection it's like what happened with

764
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,519
Lyme disease back in um uh 70 whatever

765
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
73 or whatever it was and I'm going to

766
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:50,399
tell you now I'm going to tell you right

767
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,039
now that right in the early '70s when

768
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:57,480
people filed in the doctors knew it was

769
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:59,279
viral they knew Lyme disease was viral

770
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,320
they knew the symptoms that everybody

771
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,919
was getting were 100% viral but there

772
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,519
was a massive problem the problem was

773
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:14,039
back in the 70s there weren't even

774
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,760
antivirals to make money off of so there

775
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:19,440
wasn't antivirals to make money off of

776
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,159
viral mean we we got to throw our hands

777
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,039
in the air and there's nothing to treat

778
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:24,640
you there's no way to help you and

779
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,320
that's just the bottom line because an

780
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
antibiotic was not used at all back in

781
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,159
the early 70s and when they noticed that

782
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,960
they when they used it for somebody that

783
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,880
walked in that had these these these

784
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,320
crazy symptoms that were viral they knew

785
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,519
that if they used it and they they did

786
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,799
use it they got sicker which happens to

787
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,679
90% of the lime patients of today now

788
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,760
remember this if you're one of the 10%

789
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,440
it's that had some antibiotics and swear

790
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:56,200
by them you know amazing but 90% think

791
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,120
about 90 people out of a 100 people 90

792
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,799
out of a 100 gets sicker from the

793
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,799
antibiotic meaning their condition

794
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:04,760
worsens they're worse off to where they

795
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,320
started with their lime 90 out of 100

796
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,440
just think about that line up a 100

797
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,760
people 90 of them are going to become

798
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,039
more worse

799
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,720
off sure 10 may not or eight out of that

800
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:20,120
10 may not but 90 are is a problem is a

801
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,840
massive problem and that's that's that's

802
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,639
what you have to understand and and so

803
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,639
back in the early '70s when they filed

804
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,080
in with with the first symptoms on in in

805
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:33,840
Connecticut and just so you know

806
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,399
everywhere globally was happening at the

807
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,159
same time globally at the same time it

808
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,679
wasn't just Connecticut it was

809
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,919
everywhere at the same time I talk about

810
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,639
this in in in book one with the lime

811
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,440
chapter so I don't want to go too deep

812
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:50,159
into it all you can you can totally just

813
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,960
get it from there but the bottom line is

814
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,480
when they filed in they knew it was

815
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,039
viral a viral

816
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:00,960
infection amazing smart Physicians

817
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:04,200
you know dedicated to helping people

818
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,880
knew somehow some way that this was

819
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,200
viral and and and that's incredible

820
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,320
that's incredible but medicine it wasn't

821
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,799
good for for big Pharma it wasn't good

822
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,639
for the medical world because there's no

823
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,480
way to treat it and make money off of it

824
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,919
there's no way to treat it no way to

825
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,279
make money off of it so it was a

826
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,039
disaster it was a finan it was a it was

827
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,600
it wasn't a financial

828
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,600
gaining illness there were people filing

829
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,159
in but there's no way to financially

830
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,760
gain so that's where the bacterial thing

831
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,000
had to come later I know people you know

832
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,279
that are that know that they're really

833
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,720
hung up on Lime right now they're

834
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,679
probably just swearing at me and maybe

835
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,600
even turning off the radio and uh just

836
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,360
keep it on try to keep it on and hang in

837
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,399
there and so when it what was bacterial

838
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,679
deemed you were able to treat it and

839
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:58,080
then and then the antibiotics became a

840
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,840
massive a massive financial gain

841
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,159
and we've suffered 30 I mean I've seen

842
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,200
people 30 20 years ago whatever you name

843
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:07,720
it even longer that if if their lives

844
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,320
have been ruined and they put in

845
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,360
wheelchairs because of the antibiotics

846
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,360
but the point is is

847
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,320
that anybody coming in they knew it was

848
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,240
viral now the same thing should be

849
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,679
happening now with any lupus stuff

850
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,240
instead of the trend heading to they

851
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,760
come in well I know you had lupus I know

852
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,559
you've been diagnosed with lupus 4 years

853
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,760
ago go ma'am I know that but we need to

854
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,039
do a lime panel we got to send you to a

855
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,919
lime Specialist or do a lime panel and

856
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:39,960
you probably had that this whole time

857
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,159
instead of it going there it should be

858
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,919
like this is viral The Chronic fatigue

859
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,840
the joint pain the on andof fevers the

860
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
white blood cells being totally up and

861
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,480
down which wherever where they want to

862
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,159
go which lympocytes nutrifil basophils

863
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,360
monocytes whatever it

864
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,720
is um all this involved should be like

865
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,159
hey this is viral that's what should be

866
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:08,800
happening but it's not it's not it's not

867
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,560
it's not it's a disaster and there

868
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,079
nothing's getting fixed out there did I

869
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,119
sound negative

870
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,679
today sound negative today what have

871
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,679
happened did I wake up on the wrong side

872
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,480
of the bed so

873
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,639
what all right here's the deal so um

874
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,280
when you know with lupus and lupus

875
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,760
symptoms those are viral symptoms the

876
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,320
first thing we have to understand why is

877
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,079
that important because in order to get

878
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,079
better you have to know what's going on

879
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,119
in order to get better you have to have

880
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,159
you need a truth you need to know what's

881
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:43,119
happening what's going

882
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,200
on and it it's critical to know that

883
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,520
rashes all over the body the lupus

884
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,399
people with lupus have rashes those

885
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,240
rashes that's viral those are viral

886
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,920
rashes that was

887
00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:01,800
101 that was um one 101 back in the

888
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,960
early 1970s with Physicians rashes that

889
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,240
H that are like you you know someone

890
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,720
with lupus is 101 a viral

891
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,320
infection chronic viral

892
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,200
infection where did we go wrong so the

893
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,160
early the Early

894
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,079
doctors that you know took in early lime

895
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,839
people the very first ones in early 7s

896
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,599
they were brilliant

897
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:27,359
brilliant but they got stifled that they

898
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,880
were told to shut up

899
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,480
they were told to shut up that's right

900
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,079
they were told to shut up don't be

901
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,760
telling everybody what they really don't

902
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,079
be telling the truth cuz we we need to

903
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,119
make money off this and that's where it

904
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,760
went wrong it's the start anyway and

905
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,680
then we were trained trained otherwise

906
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,119
so now we're trained with lupus the

907
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,280
body's attacking itself it's autoimmune

908
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:53,599
you walk in you get a lupus diagnosis oh

909
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,319
it's your fault your body's attacking

910
00:35:53,599 --> 00:36:00,760
itself how's that you see what it mean

911
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,440
it's just it's just it's mindblowing

912
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,400
yeah this stuff keeps me up at night you

913
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,200
know I wake up and I'm like thinking

914
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,599
about it like how do we change this what

915
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,960
do we do and spirit's like we're going

916
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,400
to put the books out and we're going to

917
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,599
get people to learn we just have to I'm

918
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,839
like okay all right and you know here's

919
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,640
the deal so with

920
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:25,160
lupus the body is not attacking itself

921
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,440
bottom line so you're told the body's

922
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,240
attacking itself it's not attacking

923
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:29,720
itself it's not there's a virus there's

924
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,480
a viral infection there's a virus

925
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,640
attacking the body it's important to

926
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,240
know that because your immune system

927
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,560
will line up to that your immune system

928
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,560
will line up to the thinking to actually

929
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,880
The Knowing to your cells in the body

930
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,319
that there's an Invader that needs to be

931
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,960
kicked out of your body and that's what

932
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:44,839
you're going to start doing kicking the

933
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,079
crap out of it out of your body what's

934
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:51,760
the Invader with lupus 100% Epstein bar

935
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,680
Epstein bar 100% related it is what it

936
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,440
is when someone walks into a doctor's

937
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,880
office and they got the chronic fatigue

938
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,359
and they got the unexplainable Jo joint

939
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,200
pain and unexplainable everything else

940
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:01,839
that goes along with it they should be

941
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,359
like the doctor should be like we're

942
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,839
doing Epstein bar panel and we're also

943
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:07,480
not going to we're not going to stand

944
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,400
for whatever that panel says because the

945
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,079
Epstein bar panel is is still not a

946
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,960
strong it's still not a strong test

947
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,800
because there's so much confusion with

948
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,520
it but it's Epstein bar is what it is if

949
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,280
it shows like what happens is you'll get

950
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,200
the Epstein bar test and be like well

951
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,000
you had Epstein bar you had it at one

952
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,880
time in your life but it's not what's

953
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,400
causing the lupus symptoms now that's

954
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,960
not true what happens is Epstein bar has

955
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,520
different stages you get it first it

956
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,640
goes away but it doesn't go away it goes

957
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,599
away and it still causes problems it

958
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,560
still causes problems to organs it still

959
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,800
causes symptoms it causes toxins which

960
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,720
are

961
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,319
neurotoxins which identify to a lot of

962
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,839
the chronic pain chronic nerve pain

963
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:54,640
because of neurotoxins you don't need a

964
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,880
blood test saying that it's present in

965
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,839
the moment because it's not in the

966
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,440
bloodstream the virus the Epstein bar is

967
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:04,599
not sitting in the bloodstream it's in

968
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,839
tissue it's in the liver it's in places

969
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,560
in the body it's in the spleen they

970
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,599
can't test for that that's what I mean

971
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,839
science and research just can't even get

972
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,040
up to the point of what to do for

973
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,640
testing for viruses properly but lupus

974
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,160
is the Epstein bar sits inside the liver

975
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,480
releases a lot of dermatoxin which

976
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,560
becomes the

977
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,640
rashes the rashes these they're dermat

978
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,359
toxic

979
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,880
rashes it's a toxin the liver gets

980
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,240
sluggish every lupus person has a

981
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,440
sluggish liver the liver gets real

982
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,359
sluggish the Epstein bar sits inside the

983
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,720
liver it releases the poison the poison

984
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,480
gets surface to the skin because it

985
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,839
can't find its way out of the body easy

986
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,359
because the liver is really sluggish and

987
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:51,520
the lymphatic systems swelling with a

988
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,440
lot of people with lupus so the toxins

989
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,760
have nowhere to go they surface to the

990
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,280
skin and you get the rashes they can be

991
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,680
shapes and size es all kinds they can be

992
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,160
butterfly they can be not butterfly they

993
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,400
can be everything blotches blotches here

994
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,480
everywhere and that's why everybody's so

995
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,920
confused and they're staying confused

996
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,800
and then the doctors who just you know

997
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,720
like because lime is getting so popular

998
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,800
it's like just no wait it's been lime

999
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,480
all this time and then Lupus patients

1000
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,480
get bombarded with a ton of antibiotics

1001
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,040
which a lot of lime doctors have learned

1002
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,599
over the last 30 years they practice

1003
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,280
that it was a mistake so they're doing

1004
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,319
way less of that thank God and they're

1005
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,800
using cat's claw and they're using other

1006
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:31,760
things but they don't realize those

1007
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,480
practitioners don't realize the reason

1008
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,160
why cat's Claw is working is because

1009
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:39,319
cats claw kills Epstein

1010
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:43,480
bar it kills

1011
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:45,520
viruses that are creating lime symptoms

1012
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,119
and they're like oh okay well now we're

1013
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,359
on to something we're doing less

1014
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,560
antibiotics and sometimes no antibiotics

1015
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,480
at all and we're using vitamin C and IV

1016
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,200
infusions and we're using cats claw and

1017
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,720
we're getting results thank God Spirit

1018
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,640
was able to give those results 30 years

1019
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,400
ago to all the lime people that came to

1020
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,359
me and I've had to recover hundreds and

1021
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,720
hundreds and hundreds of lime patients

1022
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:10,640
over the last three decades because

1023
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,640
Spirit gave me the advanced information

1024
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,200
I'm giving you today then when it was

1025
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:18,560
really

1026
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,839
prehistoric back then really

1027
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,520
prehistoric I love it when someone comes

1028
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:24,520
to me and be like yeah you know this new

1029
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,640
lime doctor is great doesn't use

1030
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,240
antibiotics he's just starting to use

1031
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,079
vitamin C IV and he's just starting to

1032
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,079
use some cats claws like great I was

1033
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,000
doing that 30 years ago cuz the spirit

1034
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,440
helping my people live their life and

1035
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,040
get better then so they can have a life

1036
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,160
now and you know so the good news is

1037
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,200
it's shifting am I being sarcastic I

1038
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,680
think so it's shifting it's shifting and

1039
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,880
that's the good

1040
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,200
news but with lupus yes those rashes

1041
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,880
they're all dermato toxins coming from a

1042
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,920
virus that's releasing the poison after

1043
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,960
consum consuming poison in the liver and

1044
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,440
in the body including foods that we're

1045
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,760
not supposed to be eating whatever that

1046
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,079
might be dairy products cheese milk

1047
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,240
butter eggs ghee whatever it's just

1048
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,200
anything like that can feed viruses

1049
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,200
really bad and so that's something there

1050
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,920
canola oil can feed viruses really bad

1051
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,440
we got to be careful and stay away from

1052
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,280
that we got to be cautious on the animal

1053
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,839
proteins I'm not anti-animal protein I

1054
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,640
say it again I say it in the different

1055
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,000
groups I've always said look it's about

1056
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,720
lowering your animal protein it's you if

1057
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,480
you're a big animal protein person you

1058
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,000
can keep it but you got to lower it you

1059
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,440
can't be doing eggs and bacon for

1060
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
breakfast in the morning it's not going

1061
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,880
to get you better I don't care what

1062
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,720
anybody says whatever belief system is

1063
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,839
out there cuz it's not about a belief

1064
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
system here it's about what's wrong with

1065
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,839
you

1066
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,160
internally that's another problem I have

1067
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,960
every now and then somebody to be like

1068
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,560
look I think you're anti- you're anti

1069
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,880
the high protein animal diet out there

1070
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,319
no that's not it I'm anti whatever is

1071
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,280
going to happen that shouldn't be

1072
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,000
happening inside the body that we can

1073
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,839
change by doing something different so

1074
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,200
something gets better in the body I

1075
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,720
don't know if I'm anti whatever that

1076
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,760
meant but you know what I

1077
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,440
mean and and so if you're big on animal

1078
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,680
protein you've been diagnosed with lupus

1079
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,599
that's got to you got to cut that back

1080
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm just saying because I'll tell you

1081
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:23,000
why the animal fat in the animal protein

1082
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,200
is hard on the liver and with lupus you

1083
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
always have a liver problem there's

1084
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,000
always a liver issue that's why the

1085
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,359
inflammation tests even come out like

1086
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,720
they do when they come out the Ana

1087
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,599
anti-nuclear antibody test comes out in

1088
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,400
a lot of new lupus people because it's

1089
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,640
just gear it's showing inflammation C

1090
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,640
reactive protein showing

1091
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,359
inflammation and these are showing

1092
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,720
something that inflammation stemming

1093
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,400
from the liver that's from having a

1094
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,599
viral infection deep in the liver

1095
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,240
longterm like every single lime person

1096
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,319
has as well and that can release a lot

1097
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,160
of rashing and sometimes it just

1098
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:01,119
releases depending on what variety of

1099
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,720
Epstein bar you have and what strain you

1100
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,119
have sometimes it just releases the

1101
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,440
neurotoxin causing the joint pain and

1102
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,800
not the rashes it all depends the fever

1103
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,880
is because you have the virus there

1104
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,440
too that's that's happening as well

1105
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,559
organs getting inflamed isn't your body

1106
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
attacking the organ and that's what

1107
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,480
happens with medicine today they're

1108
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,400
putting lupus in the autoimmune category

1109
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,200
your body's attacking itself your the

1110
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,400
problem your body's the

1111
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,079
problem and um and so that's that's

1112
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,520
where you fall into the category there

1113
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,839
too eventually lime will just be thrown

1114
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,640
in autoimmune as well later on I maybe

1115
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,079
it already did so far and I didn't I

1116
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,319
didn't you know I didn't get told about

1117
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,960
that I don't check about I don't check

1118
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:49,920
on what's happening out there too often

1119
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,680
I get Advanced information from Spirit

1120
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,599
that's always forward past it so I never

1121
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,440
I never really you know I never because

1122
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,599
I you know there's something sometimes

1123
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,160
you get you know how if you if you look

1124
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,520
into things that are so cockeyed and

1125
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,800
they're so they're so they're so

1126
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,800
backwards that you you you almost get

1127
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,200
like what is it you start losing brain

1128
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,960
cells and that's what happens out there

1129
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,960
so um so I don't know if they've deemed

1130
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,559
Lyme disease in the autoimmune you know

1131
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
category yet or whatever I'm sure

1132
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,880
they're probably heading there but

1133
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,640
damaged organs everything around that

1134
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,400
you know um inflamed organs kidneys

1135
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,520
kidney problems with lupus that's that's

1136
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,960
a viral inflammation inflammation that

1137
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,319
because a virus is creating the

1138
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,599
inflammation not your body antibodies

1139
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,400
produced by your body are trying to go

1140
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:39,920
after the virus they're not inflaming

1141
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,480
you they're trying to go after the virus

1142
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,400
they're trying to work on it now you

1143
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,079
need to know that you're viral so that

1144
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,839
your body works for you even more and

1145
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:48,680
you need to know you can stomp it out

1146
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:50,960
and you can kick it out and you can beat

1147
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,240
it down and you could win this and you

1148
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,599
can heal I've seen it I've helped people

1149
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,960
go through it for years and years and

1150
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,960
years

1151
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,599
and have helped them get past it cuz

1152
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,480
when you know the truth and you know

1153
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,839
what's wrong you can heal you can you

1154
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,359
have a better chance of healing versus

1155
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:11,079
completely not knowing and and and be

1156
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,280
and just falling in the whole chronic

1157
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:16,480
illness pattern that's out there in the

1158
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,720
world where there's just so much

1159
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,880
confusion so getting the inflammation

1160
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,920
down got it back down on the animal

1161
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,000
protein when it comes down to lupus so

1162
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,760
your kidneys so your liver can actually

1163
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,760
heal the amount of bile your liver has

1164
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,880
to produce to break down animal fat is

1165
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,319
unbelievable you can't even imagine how

1166
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,440
much bile salt is needed how much bile

1167
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,359
is needed in general and and and to to

1168
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,599
try to break down and disperse that fat

1169
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:49,720
that's in a piece of lean meat I'm not

1170
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,559
anti-meat not anti-animal products you

1171
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,040
just have to minimize it this the same

1172
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:56,839
thing with vegans same thing with vegans

1173
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,880
vegans just this this is example someone

1174
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,800
also said wait a minute you're

1175
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,599
anti-vegan someone said that to me the

1176
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,480
other day I said no it depends on what's

1177
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,880
going on inside the body if you're

1178
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,240
eating too many nuts and seeds like

1179
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,760
putting tablespoons of nut Butters by

1180
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,720
the way there's all kinds of high fat

1181
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,400
diets out there that we're going to have

1182
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,440
to do a whole show just on that I know

1183
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm going to get Flack I know that

1184
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,079
that's a trend that's taken over I know

1185
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,480
people are going to be pissed at me but

1186
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,040
it doesn't matter it's about you you got

1187
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,520
to remember something that's the whole

1188
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,760
point it's about watching your back it's

1189
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,480
about you that's that that's the whole

1190
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,839
point you know so if I got to take flak

1191
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,359
because there's a trend going on so what

1192
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:39,119
it's about getting you the right

1193
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:41,160
information okay that's the whole point

1194
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,839
so if you're doing tablespoons of nut

1195
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,559
Butters and coconut oil and blending

1196
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,200
that up in the morning it's hard on the

1197
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,839
liver you got to keep your fats down

1198
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,280
lower those fats when it comes down to

1199
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:56,319
lupus break them down 50% if you're

1200
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:59,640
vegan break it down 50% 50% less fats

1201
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:02,319
do an avocado that day okay do a handful

1202
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,119
of nuts the rest should be apples and

1203
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,040
other Foods it you shouldn't you

1204
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,839
shouldn't be doing all the fats the

1205
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,000
heavy fats the same thing with the uh

1206
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,800
high protein diet doing lots of animal

1207
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,920
protein plus you're doing coconut oil

1208
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,079
all the stuff you just hard on the liver

1209
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,520
but with lupus that is not a good thing

1210
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,400
it's not a good

1211
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,800
thing so that's something to understand

1212
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,440
it's something to always kind of get in

1213
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:28,720
your psyche um Epstein bar protocol for

1214
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,359
Lupus now lupus people are really

1215
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,800
sensitive just like so many other people

1216
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:34,720
lime people everything exactly they're

1217
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,760
really sensitive so you start slow you

1218
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,359
get the right kind of B12 oh I've been

1219
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,599
on B12 I've been on B2 the the the the

1220
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,079
adino silab ball and meth meththa Bolam

1221
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,599
in adino silab balum in combination if

1222
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,599
you go to my website you can find a

1223
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,319
directory I don't sell the supplements

1224
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,800
you just but there's a directory to get

1225
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:53,400
you to the right

1226
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,200
ones and you get the right kind of B12

1227
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,280
you get the right kind of zinc cuz zinc

1228
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,400
is critical

1229
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,240
for it's an anti-inflammatory because it

1230
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,119
shuts down the Epstein bar virus that's

1231
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,800
something to think about you want to get

1232
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,640
a little that go to your practitioner

1233
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,319
talk to your practitioner about it cat's

1234
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,079
claw it's an amazing one I mean it's

1235
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:15,119
it's like God's Gift God's gift to us

1236
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,680
for for battling viral issues you can

1237
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,800
even do a little bit on and off some

1238
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,119
golden seal little bit of golden seal on

1239
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,680
and off here and there talk to your

1240
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,480
practitioner too lysine it's amazing for

1241
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,800
Lupus take a little bit each day you

1242
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,599
start small if you need to vitamin C is

1243
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,520
a miracle for Lupus that's a miracle for

1244
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,640
Lupus as well okay so vitamin C that's

1245
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,440
another one lemon bomb yeah these are

1246
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,160
the Staples these are the basics the

1247
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,160
reason why is because there's a lot of

1248
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,440
people that are viral a lot of people

1249
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,520
that have viruses low grade and high

1250
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,920
grade low grade or or B in their system

1251
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,920
and so all this is important foods you

1252
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,440
know what to avoid avoid the dairy avoid

1253
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,920
the eggs eggs are just the worst for any

1254
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,520
chronic illness the worst and I feel bad

1255
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,440
because you know there just farm raised

1256
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:03,079
chickens and pasture raised and they're

1257
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,359
pecking and they're eating grass seeds

1258
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:07,520
and they're all happy and beautiful eggs

1259
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,280
and the yolk is so gorgeous you open it

1260
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,000
up you got that deep yolk color and it's

1261
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:16,440
like it's like this amazing beautiful

1262
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,440
food right I get it but the problem is

1263
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,960
the viruses of today feed off of eggs no

1264
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,839
matter where what how when so you just

1265
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,680
got to take an egg break take an egg

1266
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:26,280
break all right you get better maybe you

1267
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,680
can have it a couple of eggs again maybe

1268
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,200
you could have the neighbors chicken

1269
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:32,920
eggs again okay look so um but stay away

1270
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,760
from the foods that are you know that

1271
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,319
you got to stay away from foods to bring

1272
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,720
in don't be afraid of fruit bring in a

1273
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,920
little bit of fruit try some different

1274
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,440
fruits you know stay consistent on

1275
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,040
apples get the wild blueberries in there

1276
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,920
celery juice that's an amazing weapon

1277
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,480
powerful weapon extraordinarily um

1278
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,720
healing weapon when it comes down to the

1279
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:57,359
liver when it comes down to cleaning out

1280
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,880
toxins out of the body when it comes

1281
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,640
down to um helping out edema lymphodema

1282
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,960
all the different symptoms so celery is

1283
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,920
good fennel you can juice fennel the

1284
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,640
bulbs of fennel if you can find some of

1285
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,559
those the bulbs of fennel you can juice

1286
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,720
those juicing not easy I totally

1287
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,119
understand so if you can just if you can

1288
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,400
just do some more green salads and chop

1289
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,359
up more cucumbers for your salads put a

1290
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,880
little avocado in there trade it out

1291
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:24,520
instead of turkey that that that that

1292
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,200
day and then you know have your turkey

1293
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,319
for dinner or something whatever but you

1294
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,400
know try to bring your fats down your

1295
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:33,640
animal fats down bring just a little bit

1296
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,960
maybe a little bit of avocado in try to

1297
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,400
switch it up change the diet get the

1298
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:41,280
diet cleaner I know the 28-day cleanse

1299
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,400
in the first book um got a lot of people

1300
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,680
with lupus better because they got a lot

1301
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,720
of people with Epstein bar better it was

1302
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,839
an

1303
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,599
antiviral um diet the 28-day cleans was

1304
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,359
an antiviral diet and um and that's

1305
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,640
something you can maybe play with maybe

1306
00:50:54,359 --> 00:51:01,400
do two days of it just two days of it

1307
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,960
one day of it could could be helpful

1308
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,359
most importantly know this is not your

1309
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,400
fault you're didn't created you can heal

1310
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,599
viruses don't like you knowing the truth

1311
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,720
the minute you know the truth you start

1312
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,200
getting better things start changing

1313
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,440
your body you wouldn't believe what your

1314
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,839
body does when you know what's going on

1315
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,480
inside and it's not just this random

1316
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:21,079
label with no identification of what

1317
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,480
really is

1318
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:26,520
happening it's it you wouldn't believe

1319
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:29,319
what the body does it it takes over it

1320
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,760
takes over and it starts to run the show

1321
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:33,839
better than ever before and it starts

1322
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,680
going after the viral matter it starts

1323
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,599
going after the viral cells and you

1324
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,559
start building yourself back

1325
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,520
up start building yourself back up you

1326
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,640
keep a lie heart you didn't create your

1327
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:49,040
