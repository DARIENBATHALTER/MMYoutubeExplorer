00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,280
bodily fluids through public restrooms

186
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,500
during the holidays

187
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,060
you're in a public restroom how many

188
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,919
people went into that public restroom

189
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,240
that have RSV they have the flu they

190
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,900
have a cold that have something right

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,639
going around how many people are using

192
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,819
those toilets and so forth and

193
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,039
everything else at public restrooms

194
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,900
um you're concerned about shared bodily

195
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,000
fluids with sexual activity or something

196
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,100
and you're concerned or something and

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,840
I've always talked to doctors about that

198
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,639
and said get them get them doing stuff

199
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,120
for their immune system so they don't

200
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,400
have to be so scared and stuff you

201
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,160
believe you might have been exposed to

202
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,319
foodborne pathogens and you can you're

203
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,880
concerned about getting food poisoning

204
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,180
and that's what I love about the

205
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,460
pathogen exposure shot it has all these

206
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,039
options right here built into it which

207
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,479
is incredible right there right

208
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,740
but right now

209
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
really

210
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,419
everybody's coughing everybody's sick

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,479
everybody's got the bronchitis everybody

212
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:54,360
has the sniffles the fevers and all that

213
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,840
and it's just rampant right now and

214
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,539
there's a cold and flu protocol even for

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,479
children in this book right here so

216
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:05,940
there's protocols for cold and flu

217
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,560
it's in the book so we're doing a few

218
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,800
things we're gonna do pathogen exposure

219
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,099
shot let's get started on it let's get

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,099
working

221
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,840
all right let's make the shot so I'll

222
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,180
just grab if you got a juicer you just

223
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,099
make the shot with the juicer that's

224
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,520
the best way to do it I'm gonna put this

225
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:28,620
here I'm gonna put this here

226
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,720
so all right

227
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,099
I got my celery I got everything here

228
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,479
that I need so I'm going to start out

229
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:39,959
with six sprigs of thyme so let me get

230
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,760
some sprigs of thyme right here

231
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:45,420
so

232
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,640
I love thyme we're gonna do time T shock

233
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,459
therapy which I'm excited about let me

234
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,040
get some nice sprigs I can I can choose

235
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,620
the sprigs I want because I have a big

236
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,600
pile of time right here

237
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,459
from the garden which is really cool

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,800
right Garden time so I can choose all

239
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,779
these nice little sprigs here

240
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,700
amazing

241
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,519
all right so that's the first ingredient

242
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:11,160
I have right there sprigs of Rosemary is

243
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,700
the next one so let me throw this down

244
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,700
the chute

245
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,339
I'm doing the pathogen exposure shot

246
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,160
every day right now

247
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:28,620
I'm also doing the propolis every day I

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,440
don't have the flu

249
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,140
I don't have a cold

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,660
but I'm still doing

251
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,820
the zinc and the propolis right I'm

252
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,620
still doing that

253
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,899
so I put a little time in there let me

254
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,279
put a little bit of Rosemary now too two

255
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,279
sprigs of fresh Rosemary

256
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,459
news flash

257
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,459
forewarning

258
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,620
this shot has got a bite to it

259
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,660
okay I put I put roughly around six

260
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,720
sprigs of thyme in there there we go

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,540
that that pretty much gives us about six

262
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,540
one small quote a clove of garlic right

263
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,000
here boom so here's the thing with this

264
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,700
if you use a really big clove of garlic

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,940
in the pathogen exposure shot

266
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:25,680
it's gonna be really bitey

267
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:28,380
okay so that's a medium clove so small

268
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,040
to medium is what's really

269
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:35,279
directed for that too raw

270
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,180
medium asparagus

271
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,180
stocks

272
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,120
and you go

273
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,120
there you go

274
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,260
to Rob brussels sprouts

275
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,959
I'm looking for a Brussels sprout is

276
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,800
what I'm looking for and I have them I'm

277
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,779
also gonna find a knife really quick

278
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,760
so I'm going to cut them in half if you

279
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,220
guys just got on here we're dealing with

280
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,779
cold and flu tools is what we're working

281
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,000
with right here

282
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,560
mm info we're doing the pathogen

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,040
exposure shot we're also going to be

284
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,980
doing time T shock therapy

285
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,560
we're also going to be doing

286
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,940
a little bit of zinc some propolis

287
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,880
propolis

288
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,140
I don't know what

289
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,640
what

290
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,279
the world

291
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,100
is missing out when they don't have

292
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:35,399
propolis is so important all right

293
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,180
two stalks of celery now

294
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,180
got one

295
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,519
I gave this a really thorough rinse you

296
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,440
guys

297
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,880
so if you're like wait a minute he

298
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,880
didn't wash it what is he doing

299
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,160
there you go

300
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,459
so it's all washed

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,019
picking up messages

302
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,060
all right

303
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,060
there we go

304
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,459
so I have the pathogen exposure shot

305
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,700
right here I'm very excited about this

306
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,700
actually

307
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,620
there we go

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,860
so I'm doing this every single day right

309
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,860
now

310
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,220
worried about any exposures around

311
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,060
anybody it's an important one to do so

312
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,060
I'm going to take a shot now

313
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,420
just keep in mind it's got a little bit

314
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,220
of a bite to it

315
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,279
but we're talking about antibacterial

316
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,680
we're talking about antiviral

317
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,540
talking about anti-pathogen that's what

318
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,339
this is right here so when you have this

319
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,800
going through the bloodstream now

320
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:30,480
medical medium information talks about

321
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,240
time staying longer in the bloodstream

322
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,180
so that's really a powerful aspect of

323
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,880
time but when the time is mixed with

324
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,639
these ingredients it UPS the game so

325
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,980
this is information from above

326
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,480
this isn't concocted by me saying hey I

327
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,639
feel like putting some time in Rosemary

328
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,800
together and a little bit asparagus and

329
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,959
everything else let me just make a drink

330
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,839
it might be supportive for my immune

331
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,820
system this was explicit directions

332
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,260
details that came from above for this

333
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,260
pathogen exposure shot

334
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,160
it just feels really good too going down

335
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,500
I feel like I'm arming my immune system

336
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,959
what I like to do is I like to focus on

337
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,540
that too and focus on my immune cells

338
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,700
eating this up because this is fuel for

339
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,260
the for your immune system right and

340
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,060
then I'm thinking about phytochemical

341
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,500
compounds that are in the time and

342
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,899
everything else

343
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,160
in this shot in this phytochemical

344
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:32,100
compounds are injuring and damaging not

345
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,639
you but the pathogen

346
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,639
so what's in this pathogen exposure shot

347
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,860
or weaponized phytochemical compounds

348
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,660
through nature that are going towards

349
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,660
those bugs so

350
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,680
boom

351
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,699
feels so good it really does so you guys

352
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,279
I don't know if you're doing the

353
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:54,899
pathogen exposure shot but

354
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,500
you might want to consider it if you

355
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,500
haven't done it

356
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,019
all right so

357
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,899
do you know anybody who said anybody

358
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,459
who's got the flu anybody who's coughing

359
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,199
it's running through a lot of households

360
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,519
right now it's all I hear about out

361
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,680
there it's all is that what you're

362
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,079
hearing about too

363
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,279
all right so let's keep it going here's

364
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,019
the question right can you talk about

365
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,940
how we are taught that the more

366
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,899
exposures we have the stronger immune

367
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,699
system gets and why that this is false

368
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,760
it's very false

369
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,100
okay so what you'll hear out there

370
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,519
is you'll hear

371
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,959
germs make your make you stronger

372
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,300
and that's what you'll hear out there

373
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,160
right but that's information that comes

374
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,420
from

375
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,459
authorities in health

376
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,620
that don't know why people are sick to

377
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,660
begin with so you have to keep that in

378
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,860
mind most important part of that

379
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,959
question

380
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,940
the most important part of the answer to

381
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,940
that question is this

382
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,980
that's information coming from the

383
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,680
health world that doesn't know why

384
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,899
someone has fibro MS

385
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,240
any kind of neurological condition or

386
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,100
symptom neurological fatigue tingles

387
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,560
numbness burning aches and pains skin

388
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,779
problems all the different things that

389
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,279
people are suffering with migraines that

390
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,620
are mysterious all the mysterious

391
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,740
symptoms trigeminal neuralgia burning

392
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,139
skin burning mouth burning tongue

393
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,060
oh that's a mystery to medical research

394
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,500
and science alternative medical research

395
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,779
and science too

396
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,100
all of that is a mystery unless they

397
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,500
have the books right unless they have

398
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,199
brain saver brain saving protocols so

399
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,480
your question already

400
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,519
kind of falls into the place where okay

401
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,220
so whoever's saying that in the health

402
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,079
world that that what you get exposed to

403
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,980
makes you stronger

404
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,620
how are we even able to trust that

405
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,079
when they don't even know why someone's

406
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,820
in a wheelchair with MS someone doesn't

407
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,000
feel good and they got fibro lupus

408
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,740
someone has pots someone has decided to

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
know me so how come how come they don't

410
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,459
know any answers to anything about why

411
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,040
people are sick they don't know why

412
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,959
people have aches and pains and tingles

413
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,480
and numbness and vertigo and dizziness

414
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,319
and balance issues so

415
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,660
it's like oh I'm Authority in health

416
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,280
and what doesn't kill you makes you

417
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,380
stronger

418
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,199
I'm an authority in health and what what

419
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,600
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger

420
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,020
the more you get exposed to

421
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,820
the healthier and stronger you are okay

422
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,620
well then tell me why everybody's sick

423
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,380
with chronic illness we don't know why

424
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,419
everybody's sick we have no idea is it

425
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,660
the genes is it everybody's genes think

426
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,640
about how ridiculous it is

427
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,140
so the health authorities in Alternative

428
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
Health or whatever conventional Health

429
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,520
that are saying that you get stronger

430
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,980
from getting exposed when they don't

431
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,480
even know why anyone is sick why moms

432
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,280
can't get out of bed why people are

433
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,260
struggling with severe crippling anxiety

434
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,820
and depression

435
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,860
if you don't know why people go into

436
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,660
fitsamania and they're living with

437
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,539
bipolar syndrome and they're not and

438
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,460
they're suffering and struggling or they

439
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,780
can't even walk they're so inflamed

440
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,059
throughout their whole body they have no

441
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,980
idea why but they have the answer that

442
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,320
more exposure helps you

443
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,520
think about that

444
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,780
okay

445
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,780
our immune system is already Under Siege

446
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:27,120
so if we get more problems with their

447
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,539
immune system more challenges with their

448
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:34,020
immune system it can tank it

449
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,600
so it's not it doesn't make you stronger

450
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,059
it can finally finish somebody off

451
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,400
that's how it works our bone marrow has

452
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:44,160
to go into overdrive to produce immune

453
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,679
cells to try to protect you so exposing

454
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,020
you more is good for your bone marrow to

455
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,419
produce all those immune cells explosion

456
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,679
someone with lupus is already so exposed

457
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,840
already their immune system is

458
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,820
struggling left and right every day so

459
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,620
okay let's expose that person to more

460
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,260
stuff because some health authority

461
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,679
alternatively or conventionally says

462
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,000
that it's good for it it's good for your

463
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,100
immune system when they don't know why

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,720
you have Lupus okay so if I was somebody

465
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,260
then check this out because if you like

466
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,820
it give me a second if I had lupus

467
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,919
and I've been to all the different

468
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,419
doctors functional medicine doctors

469
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,340
don't know why people have Lupus they

470
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,480
don't unless they use mm info we know

471
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,820
that

472
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,919
but if no one if I had lupus and I went

473
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,900
to 10 Specialists and they didn't know

474
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,059
why I had lupus and then they told me

475
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,740
but more exposure is good for you how do

476
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:35,059
you even trust or believe that when they

477
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,059
don't even know why I have lupus

478
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,200
if more exposures

479
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,840
help someone then how come when an

480
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,100
elderly person whose immune system is

481
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,740
lowered

482
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,780
because they're elderly they're already

483
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,700
struggling how come they're worried

484
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,679
about

485
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,419
exposing them you get ammonia you die as

486
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,960
an elderly person

487
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,280
an older person is more the morbidity

488
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,520
rate

489
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,100
it's more exposure is the scarier part

490
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,480
about older people that's why people

491
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,140
when they're all in the nursing homes

492
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,480
during the whole covid blow up

493
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,640
lost their lives

494
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,720
did it make them stronger they were

495
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,160
already sensitive they're already

496
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,799
bedridden some of them they were already

497
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,440
struggling how is it possible on any

498
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,940
level that more exposure of anything is

499
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,500
good for someone who's already sick and

500
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,400
struggling

501
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,380
so if I have Lupus if I had fibro and I

502
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,940
asked my doctor why do I have fibro and

503
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,880
lupus and they said well we don't really

504
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:39,600
know studies suggest what we don't know

505
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,400
anything it could be autoimmune okay so

506
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,960
is it better that I should get lots of

507
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,640
exposures doctor and the doctor could be

508
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
like oh yes but exposures are really

509
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,539
good I'm a functional medicine MD and

510
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,860
I'm telling you that

511
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,660
that thought more can really make you

512
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,640
stronger and it's good for you I'd be

513
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,260
like you're insane

514
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,460
you're telling me you don't know why I'm

515
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,960
sick and then all of a sudden you're

516
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,580
saying it's good for me to get exposures

517
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,020
okay let me keep on drinking out of

518
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,539
everybody's glass because that will make

519
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,580
me stronger oh what herpes simplex one

520
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:08,280
oh so you're you have a herpes simplex

521
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,100
one breakout okay let me have your share

522
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,140
your glass too oh okay great oh there's

523
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,539
herpes on the edge of the glass it's

524
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,220
gonna make me stronger so let me just do

525
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,460
it it's going to make me more stronger

526
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,900
having this so oh oh oh a year later and

527
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,880
now I'm breaking out all my lips with

528
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,380
herpes simplex one it sure as hell

529
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,299
didn't make me stronger how about

530
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,760
chlamydia

531
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:32,460
how about chlamydia how about that one

532
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,860
let me just get exposed and catch

533
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,020
Chlamydia somewhere because it's gonna

534
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,640
make me stronger meanwhile the UTIs are

535
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,100
giving me the worst UTI on the planet

536
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,360
and then another UTI and then I have to

537
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,900
take all these antibiotics and another

538
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,120
UTI let me go let me go and jump into

539
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,559
some like crazy stuff and pick up a

540
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,260
whole bunch of chlamydia

541
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:53,760
and then okay uh doctor give me a bunch

542
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,780
of antibiotics because that chlamydia is

543
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,780
sure making me stronger

544
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,460
next thing you know you're getting UTI

545
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,080
after UTI after UTI after UTI and now

546
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,179
you're getting streptococcus all the

547
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,580
time immune system's breaking down oh it

548
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,419
makes you stronger though

549
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,299
foreign

550
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:14,760
it doesn't make you stronger

551
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,799
you don't want more exposure you want

552
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,059
less exposure but what's happening out

553
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,799
there is the reason why I'm talking

554
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:22,140
about this a little more I was gonna do

555
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,760
cold and flu tips but the reason why I'm

556
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,240
talking about this a little bit is

557
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,280
because oh my God I have seen so many

558
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,840
like idiot professionals and I'm not

559
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,760
trying to judge them or anything but

560
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,880
there's so many professionals now health

561
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,580
coaches uh naturopaths chiropractors

562
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,760
Do's functional medicine doctors mvs

563
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,960
right saying more exposures better for

564
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,700
you now are you freaking kidding me

565
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,140
you don't even know why anybody's sick

566
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,360
you think more exposure is a good thing

567
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,220
for them oh let me just get exposed to

568
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,440
five more simplexes how about that and

569
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,720
maybe herpes simplex too too get getting

570
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,640
exposure to that is real great or how

571
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,640
about the flu I don't want the flu

572
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,940
and I'm not judging anybody you guys I'm

573
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,200
just saying that more exposure weakens

574
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,179
the immune system there's enough

575
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,039
problems already with people suffering

576
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,020
and struggling right now you guys have

577
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:18,539
to know this like people are sick with

578
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,820
neurological problems for real their

579
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,500
vagus nerves are all chewed up they get

580
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,299
all kinds of problems their immune

581
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,880
systems are damaged and weakened they

582
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,679
got lupus they got fibro they got ra

583
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,140
they got neurological fatigue they got

584
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,840
mecfs right they have everything plus

585
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,760
all the symptoms going on

586
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,980
people have a hundred symptoms out there

587
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,620
they have 50 symptoms out there so let's

588
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,100
expose them to more does that make any

589
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:47,400
sense to you let's expose them to more

590
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:50,900
it's absurd it's insane it's ridic it's

591
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,900
completely ridiculous

592
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,140
all right we got to keep on moving we

593
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,640

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,299
okay because I want to help you guys but

597
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,799
listen thank you for that question

598
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,480
because it's been meaning to talk about

599
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,000
it I wanted to do a podcast episode

600
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,280
about it eventually oh my God the

601
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,140
podcast episode list is like this and

602
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,539
I'm trying to chip away at it to release

603
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,940
some podcast episodes but

604
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:21,539
but what happens is it weakens us and

605
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:24,659
and it exposures weaken us so that bugs

606
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,480
that we have inside of us rise up and

607
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,039
that's mm info by the way a bunch of

608
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,200
doctors put put some kind of article

609
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,780
about that like oh yeah you have these

610
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,179
dormant viruses that are coming up

611
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,080
when you get the flu Oh I talked about

612
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:39,080
that years ago

613
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,460
I published it years ago what am I

614
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,539
saying too so what happens is that some

615
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,700
of you guys that have been with medical

616
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,440
medium information for now years know

617
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,020
I've talked about that how many times

618
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,880
and we get broken down and then our

619
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,419
immune systems get broken down and then

620
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,059
bugs rise up right they rise up and so

621
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:02,460
exposures knock are already weakened

622
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,919
immune system down and then the bugs

623
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,720
rise up and so what happens is when you

624
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:08,220
hear a doctor practitioner and listen do

625
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,159
what your doctor says and tells you to

626
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,020
do do what your doctor recommends in all

627
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,820
of that right I want you to do whatever

628
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,320
your actors are recommending you your

629
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,820
doctor what you feel good about whatever

630
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,360
with your what you're doing your doctor

631
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,980
but when I hear health professionals say

632
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,380
exposure is good it'll build up your

633
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,400
immune system that germs are your immune

634
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,039
system

635
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,220
I'm like you don't know anything I'm

636
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,320
sorry you might have a degree but that

637
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,840
degree is no better than a piece of

638
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,159
cheese sitting on a countertop because

639
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,320
honestly

640
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,059
if you don't know if you don't know why

641
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,039
people are sick and you're telling

642
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:45,600
people they need germs and germs are

643
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,640
their immune system

644
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,679
I'm sorry but take that degree and throw

645
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,600
it in the trash can just take it off the

646
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,799
wall and put it in the trash can like

647
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,460
that

648
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,460
all right

649
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:00,480
but do what your doctor says though if

650
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,600
you know whatever feels good whatever

651
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,820
your doctor recommends okay you guys I

652
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,919
am Gonna Keep On Moving on let's go into

653
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,059
it so I'm talking about zinc for a

654
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,220
little bit

655
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,559
so I take zinc all the time now you guys

656
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,080
know if you know the medical medium info

657
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,460
if you know what I've talked about

658
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,980
quality matters

659
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,900
the quality is not all the same the

660
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,159
reason why I actually endorsed Bemidji

661
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,200
and I said you know what you guys need

662
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,419
you guys need my official endorsement

663
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,279
official endorsement I need this stuff

664
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:32,279
to stay around for people I don't want

665
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,740
it to disappear I need it for myself I

666
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,020
take this stuff for myself and my family

667
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,059
I don't want it going anywhere so I

668
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,919
fully endorse them right

669
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,360
but why would I even do that why would I

670
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,860
fully endorse them

671
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,799
because

672
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,080
they actually don't hide anything in

673
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,299
their products because the law requires

674
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,400
that you can hide a certain percentage

675
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,380
in supplements so supplement companies

676
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,679
out there they're allowed to actually

677
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,340
hide a certain percentage of undisclosed

678
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:04,980
stuff inside their products femergy said

679
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,900
no I'm not we're not doing it and I'm

680
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,779
like okay then that's the best it gets

681
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,059
I'm sorry that's the best it gets that's

682
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:13,320
incredible so that's the first thing the

683
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,299
other thing qualities here is they

684
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,580
choose the highest quality stuff there

685
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:19,080
is they don't choose the lower quality

686
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,880
stuff like all the companies do for

687
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,640
Price Point advantage to try to make

688
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,840
more money on a product right so if you

689
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,039
want to start a supplement company

690
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,440
tomorrow

691
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,720
and you want to do it you'll go chances

692
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,580
are you'll get talked in to the lowest

693
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,200
quality of the quality stuff so you have

694
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,120
a bigger price point Advantage so you

695
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,820
can make more money remember she says no

696
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,580
we won't do that we want the highest we

697
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,679
can find and I've never seen that before

698
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,080
the other thing third party third party

699
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,720
independently test it boom

700
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,400
and the other thing no alcohol no citric

701
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,020
acid no soy no gluten no

702
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,179
maltodextrin no natural flavors no

703
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:00,659
artificial flavors the titanium dioxide

704
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:03,299
no caffeine no alcohol ever they know

705
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:05,940
better no natural flavors they know

706
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,500
better no citric acid they know better I

707
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,720
don't even know what to say about that

708
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,460
besides that's mind-blowing to me

709
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,799
and supplement companies have their own

710
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,140
free will and they change what they're

711
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,659
doing they're like oh this this time

712
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,600
we're gonna change it up you know we

713
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,820
sold that line of product let's redesign

714
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,059
you know no one even knows what they do

715
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,919
they don't disclose things like the

716
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,419
hidden little percentage in there that

717
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:32,340
they're illegal that they're legally

718
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,960
allowed to not disclose remember she

719
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,179
says no anyway

720
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,240
that's why I endorse them

721
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:42,299
and I'll endorse them 100 times over

722
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,100
I I don't even know what to say okay so

723
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:45,539
you guys we're doing cold and flu tips

724
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,279
the whole bit today I just made the

725
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,659
exposure shot if you just got here if

726
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,980
you you should watch this from the

727
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,520
beginning too if you just rolled in

728
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:55,440
because we're doing some good stuff and

729
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,900
what I love about these three is they

730
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,760
work good together

731
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,679
so to ask your doctor what's right for

732
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,760
you right you know because you might be

733
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,860
doing something entirely different

734
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,960
whatever it is so to use the stuff ask

735
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:10,200
your doc what you feel is right what

736
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,380
they feel but for immune system helping

737
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,840

stronger and I should get exposure well

775
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,580
that's the last thing I want I don't

776
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,320
want to get exposure right now unless I

777
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,700
have no choice and I'm with family or

778
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,260

779
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,480
sneezing or something or somebody's

780
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,440
coughing and then then it's like ooh

782
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,080

783
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,520
sulfate and you'll notice out there

784
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,260
that

785
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,419
you'll see it out there influencers be

786
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,919
like yeah it's the liquid zinc sulfate

787
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:10,320
and I'm like oh yeah but you don't know

788
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,480
the right one the one that you can trust

789
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,720
that isn't gonna have anything hidden in

790
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,220
there anyway

791
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,080
Erica says without beverages supplements

792
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,000
I wouldn't have been able to heal the

793
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,799
way I have I completely understand

794
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,320
without memory supplements I couldn't

795
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,179
keep myself as strong as I've been to to

796
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,700
fight the battles for the chronically

797
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:31,860
ill to be a voice for The Chronic Leo to

798
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,679
help The Chronic Leo like I do Monica

799
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,380
says memory amazing products

800
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,260
but I I share the same same feeling

801
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,960
without a doubt you know so all that

802
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,760
matters it's like everything like all

803
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,200
these little details matter if we're

804
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,760
trying to take care of ourselves Tara

805
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,740
Appleman good to see you remember she

806
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,140
has the highest Integrity they really do

807
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,240
it doesn't exist out there otherwise I

808
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,760
haven't seen it I'm not just saying that

809
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,340
I know this as a fact

810
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,220
I really do the progress I like it's

811
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,260
consistently contains over 50 percent of

812
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:07,080
the polyphenols which is incredible so

813
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,020
that's one of the differences right

814
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,460
there that like they can hang their hat

815
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,640
on

816
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:18,720
like the propolis literally contains

817
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,100
over 50 of active polytheanols they can

818
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,500
hang their hat on that with that because

819
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,940
that's incredible

820
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,559
and it it matters which is amazing right

821
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:31,380
and I don't personally like taking Dead

822
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,940
quercetin Like Me personally I don't

823
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,500
like taking course within that's a dead

824
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,919
course at him right the polytheon of

825
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,539
course did I like knowing it's active in

826
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,159
like the propolis right here and I got

827
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,380
to show you the stuff it's like it's

828
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,860
like just

829
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,860
Liquid Gold insane

830
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,799
so why am I even doing this today

831
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,380
because all I see out there is everybody

832
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,899
coughing and sneezing and coughing and

833
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,980
sneezing and that's why and it's just

834
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:01,679
like

835
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,179
and I and I feel bad it's like I feel

836
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,980
bad for people that are getting knocked

837
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,899
down by the flu and they're sick for two

838
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,659
weeks a week three weeks six months

839
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:11,640
because it just it it lowered their

840
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,380
immune system then the Ebbs and

841
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,940
everything came up and then they're

842
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,019
having it really hard like that breaks

843
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,240
my heart

844
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:21,120
because I know that so many people have

845
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,039
it so hard already

846
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,240

847
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,200

848
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240

849
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,140

850
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,140

it even non-alcohol provolift is out

855
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,039

856
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,559
some form of alcohol they have some type

857
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,779
of poly you know uh some different type

858
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,700
of ethanol or alcohol of some kind and

859
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:49,620

thing though I'm of a little kind of

913
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,180
like I'm imagining where I don't think

914
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,859
that makes a difference in the world it

915
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,940
gets everybody addicted whatever but the

916
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,400
point is

00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,020
is that sure if you're going to be on

918
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,579

919
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,780
if you're going to be on it and no one

920
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,160
can tell you different then be on the

921
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,020
best one but either way you know how

922
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,579
there's people out there the guy run

923
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,960
into and people reach out to me and

924
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:24,720
they're like aw I want to I want to make

925
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,540
the best baby strollers ever were the

926
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,339
wheels on the baby strollers

927
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,560
they don't do this thing because there's

928
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:34,140
bearings so you see moms of their baby

929
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,000
strollers right well there's wheels on

930
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,440
those strollers obviously and moms like

931
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,560
they like to push their babies along

932
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,900
with jog or or you know exercise

933
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,160
and so companies out there be like I

934
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,540
want to do something good in the world I

935
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,040
want to make sure the wheels on the baby

936
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,660
strollers give the baby the best ride

937
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,000
ever so the baby's not bouncing around

938
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,099
as the mom's pushing the stroller

939
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,500
there's so many people out there that

940
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:58,099
just that just they want to do good

941
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,099
things right

942
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,339
well

943
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,460
I want the best propolis that's ever

944
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:08,099
been out there anywhere here so when

945
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,200
someone actually needs that best

946
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,079
propolis that doesn't exist out there in

947
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,240
the world and vimergy can create it I

948
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:18,060
want that and that feels good to me

949
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,680
to me that feels good to me you know

950
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,720
it's it's those kinds of things I want

951
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,880
the best zinc there ever was and I want

952
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,920
the best vitamin C there ever was and

953
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,800
these are the things right there that

954
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,180
matter to me you know it's like you know

955
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,160
because everybody wants to do something

956
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,400
good you know

957
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,099
anyway so all right look

958
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,359
so I just put the the propolis in here

959
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,680
so I showed you it's got the golden

960
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,900
color and everything so now I'm going to

961
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,520
do the zinc right here too and I can put

962
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,079
the zinc

963
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm gonna put a little water in this

964
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,280
shot with another shot that I have so I

965
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,260
got some water in here with the propolis

966
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,460
okay and I'm going to put some zinc in

967
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,260
there too

968
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,420
so

969
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,940
things with zinc is when you when you

970
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,160
hear the word zinc think immune system

971
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,260
right so I talk to people and it's like

972
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,060
you hear the word zinc you you think of

973
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,619
Yoon system

974
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,119
that's what I tell people they're like

975
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,460
zinc what do you do with zinc on my

976
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,619
immune system like whoa and you just you

977
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:17,339
you have that the reason why I'm saying

978
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:19,200
that is because every time your mind

979
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:23,000
your consciousness

980
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,000
sees z-i-n-c

981
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,940
okay every time your Consciousness sees

982
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,700
that z-i-n-c that's zinc

983
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,760
okay something starts Computing in here

984
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,200
right in the neurons in your brain

985
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,200
so I like to do this

986
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:45,359
because zinc is good for the immune

987
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,099
system that means your immune cells what

988
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,040
I do is I Envision my immune cells

989
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:53,520
gobbling up all that zinc

990
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,320
and then every time I even see zinc I

991
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,180
want my immune cells already getting

992
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,980
hungry

993
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,680
to receive it

994
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,119
I want that correlation I want that

995
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,040
connection right there and you guys know

996
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,780
I do the continuity thing right I'll do

997
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,579
a whole thing on that eventually too I

998
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,200
got other stuff I just got to talk about

999
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,079
so much

1000
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:16,859
but I want that register right there

1001
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,820
because you get your immune cells hungry

1002
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,740
right

1003
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,480
it's like you're getting hungry for your

1004
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,920
meal so say you're eating three meals a

1005
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,300
day two meals a day whatever you do

1006
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,579
maybe you're in your mid fast and you're

1007
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,280
doing one meal a day whatever it is your

1008
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:31,920
juices your gastric juices they start to

1009
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,619
get hungry if someone says food you're

1010
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,839
just like yeah I'm hungry someone says

1011
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,760
food your mouth starts drooling someone

1012
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,440
shows you a slice of pizza and your

1013
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,440
mouth is starting to drool right

1014
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,000
someone says zinc

1015
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,320
and you really put that connection and

1016
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,880
you're taking the highest quality zinc I

1017
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,619
feel my opinion is the highest quality

1018
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,540
zinc there is and you're taking that

1019
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,640
high quality zinc your immune cells are

1020
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,760
gobbling up and eating that high quality

1021
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,520
zinc think about that

1022
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:08,099
so all someone has to do is say zinc or

1023
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,440
you see zinc and your immune cells they

1024
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:12,839
want to do good things your immune cells

1025
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,800
want you gobble up that zinc your immune

1026
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:19,800
cells want to do good things right

1027
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,260
so I like making that connection

1028
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,780
because that matters that matters to me

1029
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,520
Spirit of compassion always told me that

1030
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,980
when you're giving yourself something

1031
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,380
like a high quality zinc

1032
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,119
and your immune cells are using that

1033
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,280
high quality zinc

1034
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,280
to battle

1035
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,280
exposures

1036
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,740
what happens is there's this connection

1037
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,300
that actually is made between your

1038
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:48,000
central nervous system your brain your

1039
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,040
neurons to your immune cells your immune

1040
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,380
system your bones everything in your

1041
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,980
body and so it's like whoa I'm getting

1042
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,960
my zinc out I see the label I see

1043
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,640
z-i-n-c I'm taking it out right here I

1044
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,980
just put it in here and already my

1045
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,359
immune system is saying give me that

1046
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,140
zinc

1047
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,280
because I'm ready for it

1048
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,280
it's really cool

1049
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,060
it's actually really powerful Cool's not

1050
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,820
the word for it it's actually really

1051
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:20,040
really powerful all right

1052
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,400
so I just made myself a propolis shot

1053
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,960
and a sync shot I put them both together

1054
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,260
that's what I like to do ask your doctor

1055
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,320
what's fine you know what you can do

1056
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,359
but that's what I do

1057
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,940
okay I'm gonna put my brain away over

medical medium time T shock therapy

1169

you know what's crazy

1170
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,599
because time existed before medical

1171
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,400
medium

1172
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:34,920
talked about

1173
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,200
to time shock therapy

1174
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,540
it discounts it as if it's not a tool or

1175
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,359
something right it's like oh no no time

1176
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:45,180
existed before him

1177
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:49,079
but did medical medium time shock

1178
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:51,480
therapy T exist before

1179
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,000
because I want to know

1180
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,680
truth is it didn't

1181
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,020
the reason why I say this it's an

1182
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,880
incredible powerful tool don't get

1183
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,359
thrown off when someone says oh he knows

1184
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:08,220
nothing about time T time has been

1185
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:09,960
around for years the Romans used time

1186
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,780
so he doesn't he's not bringing anything

1187
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,940
new right uh really

1188
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:17,160
because this is an incredible therapy

1189
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,700
right here so this shock therapy is

1190
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,680
amazing every three waking hours

1191
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,619
right

1192
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,020
12 Sprigs

1193
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:31,859
no one knew how to use time like this

1194
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:34,740
for cold and flu cold flu RSV

1195
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:37,020
nobody knew how to use time like this so

1196
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,760
it's okay I get it you know that time

1197
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,680
exists you see it in the grocery store

1198
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,599
so then you discredit medical medium

1199
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,220
really quick and say oh yeah I saw a

1200
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,720
post from an influencer out there that

1201
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,520
said medical medium doesn't know

1202
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,920
anything because he didn't invent for

1203
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,420
invent fruits and vegetables and herbs

1204
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,460
and stuff

1205
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,500
meanwhile

1206
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:58,560
sort of compassion and a messaging the

1207
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:02,099
information has invented or created

1208
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,359
incredible combinations and tools and

1209
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,940
information

1210
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,500
that is unique and original

1211
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,740
it doesn't matter if time has been

1212
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,900
growing in Italy for 2000 years

1213
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,060
it doesn't mean they used

1214
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,560
the time T shock therapy for cold and

1215
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,680
fluent to what we're dealing with now

1216
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,920
and it's how you're applying them and

1217
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,260
for what if that's all unique and so

1218
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,880
this is an incredible tool is what I'm

1219
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,020
saying and I'm talking about this right

1220
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,480
now because I noticed that some

1221
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,760
influencers they're trying to they're

1222
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,140
trying to be like oh no

1223
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,560
he's got all this original information

1224
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:39,359
so but how do I live with myself now

1225
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,760
because I want to package up and sell my

1226
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,220
own information so wait a minute he

1227
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,400
didn't create time

1228
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,440
yeah I didn't create celery sticks

1229
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,599
but nobody knew about 32 ounces 16

1230
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,579
ounces on an empty stomach every morning

1231
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,780
how it rebuilds the gastric glands and

1232
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:57,300
all that stuff all that information

1233
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,359
about how it kills pathogens everything

1234
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,880
else how to use it nobody knew that was

1235
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,560
SOC from above I'm telling you this in

1236
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,660
case you've been hearing some of the

1237
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,220
influencers throw you off path where

1238
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,800
you're like oh well he didn't create

1239
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,720
celery he didn't grow celery for the

1240
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,160
first time on this planet yeah no I

1241
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,780
didn't grow celery for the first time in

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,540
the planet but nobody knew how to use it

1243
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,180

1245
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,380

00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:36,839
health weapons to regain empowerment

1346
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,000
Dr Fawn good to see you yeah like

1347
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:41,400
petroleum has been around for millions

1348
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,040
of years but it's only until recently we

1349
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,079
can use it more efficiently the sun has

1350
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,300
been around for millions of years too

1351
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,300
solar panels not so long

1352
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,619
spot on

1353
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:58,079
very very spot on

1354
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:00,720
okay as Darkness tries to destroy all

1355
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:01,980
that's good because that's what Darkness

1356
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,800
does out there

1357
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:06,359
okay I'm reading just reading some

1358
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,400
comments see you guys

1359
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,280
nature heal says one of my clients

1360
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,559
couldn't get rid of her cough I told her

1361
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,680
about time medical medium information

1362
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:19,500
and she went out that day and texted me

1363
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:22,500
that her cough was gone in a day

1364
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,240
and that information did not exist in

1365
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,859
the health Realm

1366
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,500
so I love what people are doing now

1367
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:30,420
they're taking like an aloe leaf

1368
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:32,280
and they're saying medical medium didn't

1369
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,540
grow an aloe leaf for the first time on

1370
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,940
this planet

1371
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,319
it's ancient medicine well then how come

1372
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,579
ancient medicine didn't know what to do

1373
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,319
with it

1374
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,180
how come ancient medicine doesn't know

1375
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,460
what to do with time in the way that

1376
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,079
Spirit of compassion has brought to us I

1377
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,980
don't understand what people want from

1378
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,680
me

1379
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:52,200
it's Unique these are protocols that are

1380
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,300
unique therapies that are unique and

1381
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:56,700
they're helping people

1382
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,920
nobody knew about them all in the last

1383
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,140
20 30 years or whatever

1384
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,359
whoops

1385
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,460
as Darkness tries to destroy all that's

1386
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,520
good we Rise Against Darkness using

1387
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:12,000
light-created health weapons to regain

1388
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:15,839
empowerment you put alcohol in this and

1389
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,000
you just you just destroyed the light

1390
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,680
you put all the tincture companies out

1391
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,420
there you want to put alcohol in all

1392
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,720
your supplements then you're destroying

1393
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,720
the light

1394
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,180
you want to put citric acid in all your

1395
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,500
supplements you're destroying the light

1396
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,760
you want to put natural flavors in all

1397
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,619
your supplements you're destroying the

1398
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,900
light

1399
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:36,359
the greatest stuff on the planet right

1400
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,460
now in my opinion by far is is the

1401
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:40,319
Bemidji line

1402
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,359
you don't think I can't create my own

1403
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:46,020
line of supplements

1404
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:48,119
and call it medical medium

1405
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,940
I mean people are like it's unbelievable

1406
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,920
I just want I want I want people to have

1407
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,240
the greatest stuff there is that's out

1408
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,859
there

1409
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,900
and I just wanna

1410
00:55:55,859 --> 00:56:00,300
give free information

1411
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:03,000
and message free information non-stop

1412
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,480
wherever I can go to the library get the

1413
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,480
book for free

1414
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,040
okay as Darkness tries to destroy all

1415
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,180
that's good we rise above the darkness

1416
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,260
and I say that over and over again

1417
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:16,500
because I'll tell you why because

1418
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:19,619
there's good things that we have at our

1419
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,760
fingertips and I see how it works out

1420
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:22,319
there

1421
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,240
you know like

1422
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,099
you got the best vitamin C where it

1423
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,480
doesn't burn a hole in your stomach but

1424
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:28,859
you got all these other vitamin C

1425
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,319
companies they're using all that

1426
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:33,240
stratascorbic acid someone uses it and

1427
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:35,660
they get a belly ache and it ruins it

1428
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,660
for everybody

1429
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:44,220
as The Changing Times bring additional

1430
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,260
stress Upon Us humankind goes into a

1431
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,420
deeper Health deficit than during

00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,400
previous decades I can tell you this

1433
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,619
that the health and wellness of people

1434
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,079

1435
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,280
food and all the eat better books and

1436
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,200

00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,359
conventional medicine there's more sick

1438
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,400
people now today than there ever was 10

1439
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:04,619
years ago more sick people now today

1440
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,099
than there ever was 20 years ago I can

1441
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:12,839

1442
00:57:08,099 --> 00:57:16,680
and it's not my truth it's the truth

1443
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:19,440

1444
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,119
stolen information from mm I totally get

1445
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,920
his frustration because they're

1446
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,020
spreading half truths

1447
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,720
they are stealing so much medical medium

1448
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,819
info between influencers that don't care

1449
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,800
about People's Health between other

1450
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:33,300
health people between all that other

1451
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:36,240
stuff out there and conventional

1452
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,160
medicine it's just a poached their

1453
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:41,099
basically rating it

1454
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,140
they're taking they're poaching they're

1455
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:45,480
raping the information and that's what

1456
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,400
they do and then they mix it up with a

1457
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,900
bunch of crap that doesn't work someone

1458
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,119
can kind of hang in there because they

1459
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:53,280
get one of the tools by accident it's

1460
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,839
not cited back to mm and then they're

1461
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,819
kind of hanging in there but it's not

1462
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:59,160
good because it's really really sad

1463
00:57:56,819 --> 00:58:01,680

where chemical and the medical

1476
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,960

1477
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:35,700

00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,260
to level the playing field that is why

1480
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:42,299
they were created by SOC that's why

1481
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:44,700
they're down here

1482
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:47,780

shock therapy

1488
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,299

1489
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:11,640
tangent about the germs build your build

1490
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:13,980
you and make you stronger they don't we

1491
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,660
have to get stronger to beat down and

1492
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,760
Crush germs

1493
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:21,079
that's how it works all right let's do

1494
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,079
this now you guys

1495
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:28,400
here we are

1496
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,400
so I'm going to take this right here

1497
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,740
okay I think my time T is coming along

1498
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:37,460
quite well

1499
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,460
so good

1500
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:42,240
time T shock therapy right there's more

1501
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,760
details in the book about it you can use

1502
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,500
dry time if you really had to you can

1503
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,240
use fresh thyme it's in the book I was

1504
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,940
just reading from so there's more

1505
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,960
information in brand saver protocols all

1506
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:57,020
right

1507
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,020
so let me get some water in here

1508
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,119
some vitamin C shock therapy

1509
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:11,760
okay so what I do is

1510
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,640
take two capsules

1511
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,140
this is the micro C

1512
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,319
so what I recommend this to a family

1513
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:21,119
member or a friend I'm not worried about

1514
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:22,859
their stomach

1515
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,119
and that's that's what I do ask your

1516
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:25,500
doctor was right for you but when I

1517
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,359
recommend this I'm not worried because

1518
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,220
it's so buffered it's not straight

1519
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,260
ascorbic acid

1520
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:33,480
so it's not just straight ascorbic acid

1521
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,359
that's important to know

1522
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:40,740
and it makes it so it can be used as a

1523
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:44,099
really good tool these Details Matter I

1524
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:45,480
can't even say it enough right

1525
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,980
but I get it you know people on the

1526
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,420
internet though all you have to do is

1527
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:50,720
shout out one thing and everybody's like

1528
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,720
oh

1529
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,680
vimergy never uses tablets because they

1530
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,079
don't want all those fillers they want

1531
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,599
they don't want the glazes they don't

1532
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,400
use tablets they don't want titanium

1533
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:03,720
dioxide they don't want colors they

1534
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,700
don't want glazes they don't want

1535
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:07,680
fillers and that's the difference so

1536
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,660
what you're noticing is you're noticing

1537
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:12,420
a capsule so that's what I took out of

1538
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:16,140
here and that's what I opened right

1539
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:17,700
so I have the two capsules in there now

1540
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,799
and then I'm going to put a little bit

1541
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,520
of honey in there too

1542
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,520
like this

1543
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:25,799
I'm gonna put a little bit more in there

1544
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,240
if you want a little bit more you can

1545
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:30,480
put a little bit less in there if you

1546
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:32,819
want to now I'm going to cut an orange

1547
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,680
right here

1548
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:37,619
and I'm going to squeeze some orange in

1549
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:40,319
there it's a nice orange too

1550
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:42,599
now two teaspoons is what I did

1551
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,280
two teaspoons of raw honey

1552
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,540
if you go a little bit over two

1553
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,980
teaspoons is what I was trying to say

1554
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:49,920
that's okay if you go a little bit under

1555
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:52,079
that's okay right so I did two teaspoons

1556
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,480
of raw honey and then I did Squeeze I

1557
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,859
squeezed juice from an orange in here so

1558
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,839
you can see

1559
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:59,700
there you go you can use this is a very

1560
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,740

1563
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:11,059
now I'm going to mix this

1564
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,059
you guys don't mind

1565
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:17,000
maybe we can get a close-up on this one

1566
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,000
too this is really cool

1567
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:23,059
so we got a little close up there it is

1568
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,059

1570
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,619

1571
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:33,839
I love it

1572
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:36,000

01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:39,079

1574
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,079

01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,980
so

1578
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,799
I love the shock therapies I'm just

1579
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:00,540
looking through them now

1580
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:03,059
what you'll notice in the shock

1581
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,520
therapies too

1582
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:07,740
you'll see different ages in here but

1583
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,020
bring it to your pediatrician

1584
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:12,059
I'm going to read about time

1585
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,540
T shock therapy if you guys don't mind

1586
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:14,540
okay

1587
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,819
amazing

1588
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,339
yep

1589
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:26,460
okay time contains a phytochemical

1590
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:28,740
compound that is antiviral antibacterial

1591
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,140
anti-mold

1592
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:34,740
anti yeast

1593
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:36,780
and anti-unproductive fungus

1594
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,940
that stays circulating inside the

1595
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:41,520
bloodstream long after nutrients from

1596
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,859
other foods have either been utilized

1597
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,299
dissipated or eliminated out of the body

1598
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:48,119
so I want to show you this piece of

1599
01:03:45,299 --> 01:03:50,220
information it's critical

1600
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:52,020
that's from above there is no science

1601
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,579
research that knows what time does in

1602
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:55,980
the body besides research doesn't know

1603
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:59,700
what other things do in the body

1604
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:03,119
this is information from above that time

1605
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:06,119
stays circulating in the bloodstream

1606
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:08,400
long after nutrients from other foods

1607
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,900
have either been utilized or dissipated

1608
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,240
that's an incredible piece of

1609
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:15,240
information right there

1610
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,559
to teach us in and arm us for our immune

1611
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,299
system health

1612
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,040
that's not known out there in the world

1613
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:22,380
sure it'll be poached and someone will

1614
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,540
talk about it any day now right

1615
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,640
and not cite back where it comes from

1616
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,260
but it's an important piece of

1617
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,960
information

1618
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,370
so this is a phytochemical compound

1619
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,480
inside the time

1620
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:36,480
[Music]

1621
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,180
that actually stays in the bloodstream

1622
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,040
fighting crime

1623
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:44,220
time lingers

1624
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:48,660
ready creating a Time released

1625
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,660
protective barrier against pathogens

1626
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,059
the time has an ability to release a

1627
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:57,119
protective barrier

1628
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:59,579
times phytochemical compounds enter

1629
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,980
every organ inside the body not every

1630
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:04,920
phytochemical compound you guys reaches

1631
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:06,960
every organ inside our body

1632
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,579
that's the difference right there all on

1633
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,339
its own

1634
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:14,280
ready times phytochemical compounds

1635
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:16,680
enter every organ inside the body versus

1636
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,599
other herbs that only enter certain

1637
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,700
organs in the body so think about this

1638
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:24,240
for a second

1639
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,760
time enters every single part of your

1640
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,460
body there's no place it doesn't enter

1641
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:31,819
from the skin to every single organ you

1642
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,819
name it

1643
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:35,420
other incredible herbs

1644
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,559
only reach certain organs depending on

1645
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,559
what herbs they are

1646
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,099
okay you ready suggested applications

1647

what an EBV caused infection is anyway

1657
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:21,059

1658
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:25,260

concerns parasite concerns it isn't

1667
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:48,359
going to be the parasite that's

1668
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,039
bothering you it's going to be something

1669
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:51,720
else but the time is going to help that

1670
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:53,339
something else

1671
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,900
that's where the whole my truth thing

1672
01:06:53,339 --> 01:06:56,220
comes in all the time it's like oh no I

1673
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,140
have a parasite well no that's your

1674
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,780
truth the truth is you probably got

1675
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:02,280
simplex one hhv6 you probably got

1676
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:03,539
shingles you probably got Epstein-Barr

1677
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,579
and something else happening or

1678
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:07,740
streptococcus infection that's the truth

1679
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:10,319
truth but you're a truth which is my

1680
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:14,180
truth you think it's a parasite see how

1681
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,180
it works my truth and then the truth

1682
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:20,460
autoimmune flare-ups episodes of

1683
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,319
neurological symptoms so

1684
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,020
what I love about the time T shock

1685
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:26,220
therapy is you have those options right

1686
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:28,680
there so let's take a look at this it

1687
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:30,980
says medical medium time T shock therapy

1688
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,980
directions

1689
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:34,799
this reading from brain saver protocols

1690
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,520
just so you know

1691
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:40,440
22. amazon.com us it's they're giving it

1692
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,819
away they're giving this book away which

1693
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,099
is great

1694
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:46,680
I am grateful for that

1695
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:50,039
okay because it costs more to print it

1696
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:51,960
but I am grateful that the Amazon

1697
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:54,859
actually is giving this book away right

1698
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,859
now and the other one

1699
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:59,520
because then I have hope someone will

1700
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,920
have it in their hands

1701
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,020
make a special Brew of time tea with 12

1702
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,599
sprigs of fresh thyme per cup of hot

1703
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:09,119
water like I did you guys if you only

1704
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:11,940
have access to dry time use two

1705
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,099
tablespoons of dried herb per cup of hot

1706
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,679
water let's steep for at least 15

1707
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:18,779
minutes remove the thyme sprigs or

1708
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:21,120
strain the tea especially if you're

1709
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:24,660
using dried thyme so if you're using dry

1710
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:27,000
thyme strain it is what I would do fresh

1711
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:29,040
thyme you can just literally sip out of

1712
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,900
here like this

1713
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,359
but if sprig of time might go up your

1714
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:36,239
nostrils so

1715
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,100
I think that one just did

1716
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:40,319
okay this question on that one this shot

1717
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:43,859
works so well prevented me from getting

1718
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:47,060
sick a month and a half ago

1719
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:47,060
over there on Instagram

1720
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:52,739
amazing oh the pathogen exposure got you

1721
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:55,259
actually that's incredible

1722
01:08:52,739 --> 01:08:57,900
see guys these are the things we're

1723
01:08:55,259 --> 01:08:59,940
talking about today I hope you hope you

1724
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:02,040
got some really cool tools and tips cold

1725
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:04,739
and flu tips and everything right well

1726
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,779
blueberry dream says my MRI improves in

1727
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:09,120
starting medical medium my lesion almost

1728
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:10,859
disappeared that caused my double vision

1729
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:13,440
last winter and I've heard that a lot

1730
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:14,400
from people who have either optic nerve

1731
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,799
lesions

1732
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,620
or lesions on the brain different areas

1733
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:21,359
of the brain and improving from certain

1734
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,679
medical medium protocols that they've

1735
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,299
that they've worked on them so

1736
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:26,279
customizing themselves which is

1737
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:27,960
incredible

1738
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,120
so

1739
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:32,940
medical medium Army says why do kids

1740
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,279
always get sick it's all over the day

1741
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:37,699
cares and Schools are they putting the

1742
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,699
bugs

1743
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:42,299
in people

1744
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:45,060
well anyway so a lot of kids get sick

1745
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:48,179
absolutely it's just an easy place to

1746
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:51,179
spread germs but Office Buildings are

1747
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:52,620
getting just as sick

1748
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:54,239
if you're in an office building

1749
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,060
everybody in the office building

1750
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:58,560
eventually gets something if you're in a

1751
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,320
classroom

1752
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,420
it's just a lot of people together

1753
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,920
sneezing and coughing on each other

1754
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:06,540
touching things it's just life it's just

1755
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,920
the way it works it doesn't matter if

1756
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,739
you're in an office building doesn't

1757
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,780
matter if you're in school doesn't

1758
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:16,380
matter if you're in a house with your

1759
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:21,260
whole family eventually we can you know

1760
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:21,260
contract or spread cold flu

1761
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:27,120
well blueberry dream says I have

1762
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:29,280
multiple sclerosis and MRI has gotten

1763
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:32,040
better the doctors told me the best I

1764
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,040
could do was keep my Ms at Bay I'm

1765
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:38,040
actually healing yes of course on my

1766

third 369 right now day two so you chose

1767
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:44,460
the 369. here's here's how it works

1768
01:10:42,179 --> 01:10:46,800
when you hear somebody say because the

1769
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,540
trolls are doing this now also the

1770
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,800
some influencers are doing this now too

1771
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,540
to try to knock down medical medium

1772
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,580
credibility they'll say

1773
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,140
I did medical medium to the letter and

1774
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:57,179
did not get better it's like what did

1775
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,880
you do you did it to the letter really

1776
01:10:57,179 --> 01:11:01,380
like what because that person that that

1777
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,500
incredible person right there who's

1778
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:07,199
healing her multiple sclerosis is doing

1779
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,600
the 369s

1780
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,340
so you know which is incredible and and

1781
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,960
probably doing supplementation maybe

1782
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,140
maybe part of the medical medium

1783
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,820
multiple sclerosis protocol but you it's

1784
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:19,320
like what are you doing

1785
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,360
you know people there's a lot of people

1786
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,100
that dabble and they only do like a

1787
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,060
little they do celery juice once in a

1788
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,800
while

1789
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:29,219
and then they're just like I did medical

1790
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:31,020
medium but did you like fly on the wall

1791
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:33,659

you so get this book when you can right

1829
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,260
it's got some Origins about medical

1830
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,920
medium

1831
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,920
foreign

1832
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:15,840
okay oh Aubry Audrey says be happy with

1833
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,360
the people who are following you dot dot

1834
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,100
you have thousands and thousands not

1835
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,500
everyone is going to listen to you dot

1836
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:24,960
dot dot but when someone is someone new

1837
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,600
finding you they get kind of turned off

1838
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,480
with the whining about who's not giving

1839
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,060
you credit I love what I've learned from

1840
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,360
you but when I try to turn others onto

1841
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:39,600
you that's the feedback I get of why

1842
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,280
they don't want to follow like I do just

1843
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,020
passing that on I appreciate you passing

1844
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,820
that on but

1845
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,620
but here's the point that I think you're

1846
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:49,440
missing okay

1847
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:51,560
if no one knows where the info comes

1848
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,560
from

1849
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:55,679
then how are they going to heal

1850
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,500
do you know how many people that are

1851
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,880
bedridden that are on mattress Island

1852
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,159
they can't even function

1853
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:03,659
and they get lost they'll end up putting

1854
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,520
charcoal they'll dump charcoal in their

1855
01:14:03,659 --> 01:14:07,140
system or tons of sodium bicarbonate and

1856
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,100
now they're in the hospital for the 20th

1857
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,659
time

1858
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,760
do you know how many people like feel

1859
01:14:09,659 --> 01:14:13,620
like there's no hope and they're like

1860
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,320
there's no hope to heal and they've been

1861
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:18,600
to 10 neurologists and specialists

1862
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,219
I mean do you know how many moms can't

1863
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,679
get out of bed and feed their kids and

1864
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:24,600
did you know that when they get derailed

1865
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:27,060
it's another year that their kids are

1866
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,580
not going to see a happy mommy

1867
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:32,100
did you know that like when a mom gets

1868
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,780
derailed and loses two more years their

1869
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,580
child goes from four years old to six

1870
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,739
years old and in those two years their

1871
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:39,960
child is between four and six their mom

1872
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:41,760
was freaking miserable because she was

1873
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,920
sick and went to every doctor Under the

1874
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,080
Sun and then she was tricked by Fork

1875
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,520
tongue out there

1876
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:50,159
derailing her because they didn't give

1877
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,480
medical medium info credit and cited it

1878
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,860
and cited the medical medium information

1879
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,300
back

1880
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:56,460
do you know how much Fork tongue out

1881
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,860
there is totally tricking people think

1882
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:02,460
about it I've seen moms out there where

1883
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:05,520
their kids were were raised during the

1884
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:07,560
the most vulnerable years between ages

1885
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,060
like two and ten years old and it took

1886
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,800
eight years for the mom to find medical

1887
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,540
medium info and guess why she didn't

1888
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,960
find it she was derailed over and over

1889
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:18,300
again told that I was whining about

1890
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,719
getting all the credit

1891
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:24,239
I'm such a great guy and are told that

1892
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:26,460
it's all a farce or told that whatever

1893
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,020
but I appreciate that you that you know

1894
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,699
the information and you follow it and

1895
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:31,380
you listen to it I do Audrey and I

1896
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:33,900
appreciate that but I'm just trying to

1897
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:35,880
let you know that

1898
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:37,739
that and listen I know that you're cute

1899
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,540
I know that if we had a conversation you

1900
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:40,980
could say a lot more and you can talk to

1901
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,600
me about it and I know that in comments

1902
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:44,340
just know I have respect for the fact

1903
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,900
that you can only say so much in a

1904
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:48,600
comments right and I'm reading that

1905
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,460
comment so I respect that

1906
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,840
right but if you can't listen to the

1907
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:53,820
telegram messages I've been leaving

1908
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,120
about this kind of thing I left two last

1909
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:56,120
night

1910
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,679
I think the hardest hardest part too is

1911
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:03,659
like when a mom's driving home from the

1912
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,219
doctor's office with her teenager their

1913
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:08,100
teenage son

1914
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:10,140
or teenage daughter and the doctor said

1915
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,820
that you have autoimmune and the

1916
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,699
teenager

1917
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:16,679
is in the car with their phone

1918
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:18,540
and they're looking up and they're

1919
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:19,620
looking up autoimmune right so they got

1920
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,780
their phone and they're looking up

1921
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,520
autoimmune and they're in the car and

1922
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:25,560
they're like mommy it says here that my

1923
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,120
body is destroying itself it's attacking

1924
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:29,400
itself

1925
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,679
how am I going to heal I heard this so

1926
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,960
much kids telling their moms moms have

1927
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,600
told me this the moms are like I don't

1928
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,460
know sweetie I don't know why your your

1929
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,080
body is destroying itself and that's

1930
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:42,060
what they lead the doctor's office is

1931
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,679
hearing that their immune systems are

1932
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:45,960
attacking itself that's one of the

1933
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,760
reasons why it's critical to get people

1934
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,260
to know where the information comes from

1935
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,320
to help Free People of that

1936
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:53,940
misinformation so it all counts

1937
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,739
it just does

1938
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:58,620
if I don't whine

1939
01:16:55,739 --> 01:17:00,300
and moan and groan about it how am I

1940
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:02,280
going to protect the chronically ill and

1941
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,040
the information at hand

1942
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,840
so that people have a Fighting Chance

1943
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,219
and I get it there's a few different

1944
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,840
types of people that come to Medical

1945
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:11,640
medium some people they're not sick

1946
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,580
they're just partially

1947
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,679
sick a little bit and they get annoyed

1948
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:18,179
because they're still able to play those

1949
01:17:16,679 --> 01:17:19,500
reindeer games out there and try

1950
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:20,699
different things everywhere but if

1951
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,800
you're somebody that comes to medical

1952
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:24,600
medium and you're literally

1953
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,820
on mattress Island and you got nothing

1954
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,500
left in you

1955
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:32,040
and

1956
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,540
every my whining counts

1957
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,500
does it ever

1958
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,500
anyway you guys

1959
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,580
um but thank you Audrey I do appreciate

1960
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,159
it there's so much Fork tongue out there

1961
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:46,020
Audrey that's a problem and and there's

1962
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:48,000
so many hate campaigns against medical

1963
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:49,620
media and there's so much research

1964
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,719
inside stealing medical media

1965
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,460
information and never crediting and

1966
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:56,040
still crapping on it where they get it

1967
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:59,040
from which is me

1968
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:01,320
you know so

1969
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:03,239
I have to stay ahead of it all I have to

1970
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,980
protect people as much as I can

1971
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:07,199
if I don't

1972
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,300
help people

1973
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:11,699
steer clear from all the traps they can

1974
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:14,460
lose years

1975
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:16,500
in their healing process or sick process

1976
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:19,860
sickening process or healing process

1977
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:21,719
they can lose years like for real

1978
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:23,460
I mean you could lose 10 20 years you

1979
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:24,540
know what I used to say years ago in the

1980
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:27,060
first book and even before that

1981
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:28,860
published and also lectured about you

1982
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,020
can lose 10 20 30 years of your life

1983
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:33,739
