[118.56 - 122.52] they're jammed packed now I forewarn you
[121.14 - 124.98] this is a little disclaimer right here
[122.52 - 128.04] when you get the books
[124.98 - 128.90] just know that every line is packed with
[128.04 - 132.54] information
[128.90 - 134.94] every sentence there's no cookie cutter
[132.54 - 138.42] fluffer butter Nutter or anything in
[134.94 - 141.48] these books it is sentence to sentence
[138.42 - 143.34] to paragraph of life-changing powerful
[141.48 - 147.36] Advanced comprehensive detailed
[143.34 - 149.52] information from above far Advanced from
[147.36 - 151.38] anything signs of research has they're
[149.52 - 153.54] going to be poaching the out of
[151.38 - 155.16] these books science and research the
[153.54 - 157.26] clinics all the clinics you know the
[155.16 - 159.18] mayonnaise Clinic all of them they're
[157.26 - 161.34] going to be poaching poaching taking
[159.18 - 162.90] podcast doctors are going to be poaching
[161.34 - 164.88] and taking from these very books it's
[162.90 - 166.02] like they've done the other books and
[164.88 - 167.70] that's what they're going to do they
[166.02 - 168.84] don't have any original information of
[167.70 - 170.40] their own they don't have any
[168.84 - 172.56] information about the brain besides
[170.40 - 174.84] telomere and the fact that
[172.56 - 177.54] we're all genetically whatever and then
[174.84 - 179.46] we'll Neuroscience but they don't know
[177.54 - 181.20] why people are sick they don't know why
[179.46 - 183.54] people are struggling and they're going
[181.20 - 186.54] to poach the out of these books
[183.54 - 189.42] because they're so ahead of science and
[186.54 - 191.40] research so ahead of the time and that's
[189.42 - 193.68] what we're up against and when you hold
[191.40 - 195.06] these books you're gonna know when you

[241.02 - 245.76] and what you're doing I talk about micro
[243.36 - 247.32] dosing in these books right so let me
[245.76 - 250.56] just like cover just a couple little
[247.32 - 252.48] things really quick in here santara is
[250.56 - 254.28] healing good to see you always proud of
[252.48 - 256.86] you too by the way santara and you you
[254.28 - 259.80] actually post the coolest stuff just did
[256.86 - 261.90] the adrenal stabilizer shot again and oh
[259.80 - 264.72] my God it's actually insane how quick
[261.90 - 266.52] they work actually a miracle
[264.72 - 269.76] Sentara
[266.52 - 273.54] I kid you not I mean when I do those
[269.76 - 275.16] brain shot therapies it hits me fast now
[273.54 - 276.54] as I was telling you guys before in the
[275.16 - 279.96] earlier live today I was trying to
[276.54 - 282.78] forewarn you in alternative medicine
[279.96 - 285.30] and conventional medicine it's not about
[282.78 - 287.70] instant relief right and alternative
[285.30 - 291.06] medicine it's not about instant relief
[287.70 - 293.46] no one's expecting no one's anticipating
[291.06 - 294.74] instant relief I'm trying to prepare you
[293.46 - 297.24] first of all medical medium information
[294.74 - 298.98] between the celery juice and all and
[297.24 - 300.36] heavy metal detox smoothies and a lot a
[298.98 - 303.00] lot of people get instant relief with
[300.36 - 306.36] all the stuff but when it comes down to
[303.00 - 309.18] the brain shot Therapies
[306.36 - 312.24] we're talking about an instant relief
[309.18 - 314.88] people have never ever experienced
[312.24 - 316.26] before so I'm trying to prepare you so
[314.88 - 318.36] what that means is you're going to be
[316.26 - 320.34] caught off guard
[318.36 - 321.84] that's the whole point Center's healing
[320.34 - 323.40] says it literally feels like a happy
[321.84 - 326.10] drug
[323.40 - 328.38] you're it's because of the synergistic
[326.10 - 330.24] blend that Spirit of compassion created
[328.38 - 332.58] because only Spirit of compassion knew
[330.24 - 334.98] about what to put with what just the
[332.58 - 337.44] right amount just the right way so that
[334.98 - 341.28] when you took the brain shot therapies
[337.44 - 343.08] you get the relief and the thing is I'm
[341.28 - 344.76] trying to tell you because you may not
[343.08 - 348.24] be prepared for it it may not be
[344.76 - 350.94] expecting that relief so when it comes
[348.24 - 352.86] it catches you off guard which could be
[350.94 - 354.54] fine but I'm just forewarning you when
[352.86 - 355.86] you do the brain shot therapies that's
[354.54 - 359.70] really important so I just want to go
[355.86 - 362.48] over those a little a little bit now too
[359.70 - 362.48] you guys
[362.58 - 366.26] when you get your books
[366.54 - 370.26] when you get your books
[368.76 - 372.18] just know
[370.26 - 374.70] it's a heavy box so if you got to take
[372.18 - 376.86] one out at a time take one out at a time
[374.70 - 379.50] all right because I see some of you guys
[376.86 - 381.12] the books are coming the Box thrown on
[379.50 - 384.60] your doorstep and you grab the box and

[384.60 - 390.96] is this and so you know when you unpack
[387.78 - 391.92] them take about one at a time right I
[390.96 - 393.54] mean
[391.92 - 395.40] and
[393.54 - 397.56] what's crazy about it is the information
[395.40 - 400.50] is here in here
[397.56 - 402.11] it's literally every single sentence and
[400.50 - 403.50] every paragraph right
[402.11 - 406.40] [Music]
[403.50 - 406.40] so I'm in here

[426.00 - 431.24] in here and making sure I can actually
[428.30 - 434.88] communicate that to you guys all right
[431.24 - 438.36] SSC is the the smart one that's for sure
[434.88 - 442.32] and you know that's the whole thing and
[438.36 - 447.12] there are 30 brain shot Therapies
[442.32 - 448.86] seven brain shot therapy cleanses
[447.12 - 450.78] it's important to know all on its own
[448.86 - 452.46] right so I'm just going over a little
[450.78 - 455.16] bit of this
[452.46 - 457.38] so let me get to it now brain shot

[460.20 - 463.98] there's so much information in here it
[462.00 - 465.84] just it's incredible I want to go over
[463.98 - 467.72] the shifters the stabilizers and the
[465.84 - 470.82] exposures one more time with you guys
[467.72 - 472.02] that's an exciting moment I can't help
[470.82 - 474.78] it
[472.02 - 476.58] so here we are I'm just trying to bring
[474.78 - 478.50] this right to the top
[476.58 - 480.60] got my little postage notes on here I've
[478.50 - 482.76] always done that you guys medical medium
[480.60 - 484.74] brain shot therapy medical meaning brain
[482.76 - 486.30] shot therapy offers instant relief while
[484.74 - 489.06] you're working to fix problems on a
[486.30 - 490.92] deeper level in your brain and nervous
[489.06 - 493.38] system and body your brain and body have
[490.92 - 496.46] a quick response to medicinals delivered
[493.38 - 499.26] in a liquid form what I call a shot
[496.46 - 500.46] designed to be highly absorbable in the
[499.26 - 502.08] mouth and that's one of the things
[500.46 - 504.00] things I want to tell you about the
[502.08 - 506.10] stabilizers the brain shot therapies the
[504.00 - 509.28] stabilizers the shifters and the
[506.10 - 511.98] exposures these are designed to be
[509.28 - 515.22] highly absorbable it's one of the
[511.98 - 516.42] reasons why the relief comes which is
[515.22 - 519.60] incredible it's not just the
[516.42 - 521.04] phytochemical compounds mixed the right
[519.60 - 524.16] way
[521.04 - 527.22] right it's about the fact that it's so
[524.16 - 529.56] absorbable but it's it's the blend of
[527.22 - 532.38] the ingredients that make it even more
[529.56 - 534.66] absorbent inside the mouth and then in
[532.38 - 537.36] the bloodstream these brain shots
[534.66 - 539.34] they're valuable healing components can
[537.36 - 541.80] reach the brain quick so the thing about
[539.34 - 543.42] the medical medium brain shot therapy
[541.80 - 545.82] and you'll see when you get your book
[543.42 - 547.14] and you look into this
[545.82 - 548.34] one of the things that's really
[547.14 - 552.60] important
[548.34 - 555.54] is that these specially formulated shots
[552.60 - 557.64] have the ability to reset and rewire the
[555.54 - 560.40] brain one of the reasons why it gives
[557.64 - 562.02] you that relief okay
[560.40 - 563.46] and they're designed to be highly
[562.02 - 566.16] absorbable in the mouth these brain
[563.46 - 567.60] shots valuable healing components reach
[566.16 - 569.46] the brain quick and I wanted to say that
[567.60 - 572.10] again because that's the whole point so
[569.46 - 575.70] when you do the brain shots
[572.10 - 578.94] they reach the brain fast
[575.70 - 582.06] that's one of the gifts of it that's one
[578.94 - 584.70] of the powerhouses of it it reaches the
[582.06 - 587.16] brain quick so important to know right
[584.70 - 588.72] there that's a really critical piece of
[587.16 - 590.40] it
[588.72 - 591.84] and then these specially formulated
[590.40 - 594.18] shots have the ability to reset and
[591.84 - 596.28] rewire the brain another reason why you
[594.18 - 596.94] get so much relief right there on its
[596.28 - 601.14] own
[596.94 - 604.14] it can shock out the patterns while at
[601.14 - 608.04] the same time reducing triggers check
[604.14 - 609.48] this out they can shock out patterns and
[608.04 - 610.80] that's the thing so many people have
[609.48 - 612.60] patterns
[610.80 - 614.58] and the patterns can be some bad
[612.60 - 616.32] patterns it's not your fault not judging
[614.58 - 620.04] anybody no one should be judged on
[616.32 - 622.74] patterns but these brain shot therapies
[620.04 - 625.32] can shock out patterns
[622.74 - 626.88] while reducing triggers that's a huge
[625.32 - 628.44] point right there so many people are up
[626.88 - 630.42] against so many triggers they're being
[628.44 - 633.00] triggered all the time
[630.42 - 635.52] and this can shock someone out of that
[633.00 - 638.10] and actually stop the triggers medical
[635.52 - 642.60] medium brain shot therapy is Uncharted
[638.10 - 644.94] Territory so you guys it's Uncharted
[642.60 - 646.44] Territory just like all medical medium
[644.94 - 648.48] information but man these brain shot
[646.44 - 650.66] therapies is a whole other level these
[648.48 - 654.42] are special configurations
[650.66 - 657.66] synergistically combined just right to
[654.42 - 659.82] crack the code of how the fruits herbs
[657.66 - 661.62] leafy greens wild foods and vegetables
[659.82 - 664.86] can work as medicine now here's what's
[661.62 - 667.86] insane about the brain shot Therapies
[664.86 - 670.26] it what happened with SOC and giving you
[667.86 - 671.60] this information it was about cracking a
[670.26 - 674.70] code
[671.60 - 677.40] synergistically with combining the right
[674.70 - 679.14] ingredients out of the wild Foods out of
[677.40 - 680.88] the fruits out of the leafy greens out
[679.14 - 683.52] of the vegetables and the herbs to
[680.88 - 686.24] actually make it work so you get that
[683.52 - 686.24] powerful relief
[687.66 - 691.56] it just blows me away while Creative
[689.88 - 693.06] Juice concoctions have their place in
[691.56 - 694.44] human creativity in the kitchen should
[693.06 - 696.06] be honored and that's true people can
[694.44 - 697.38] throw a bunch of things together and
[696.06 - 699.54] juice it or whatever there's a big
[697.38 - 701.88] difference here it's not what you will
[699.54 - 704.22] find here these brain shots
[701.88 - 707.22] aren't just tasty Delights thrown
[704.22 - 709.34] together for a fun experiment instead

[716.28 - 719.82] brain shot therapy are tools that come
[718.32 - 721.08] from above
[719.82 - 723.06] above
[721.08 - 724.86] these brain shots are composed of
[723.06 - 726.32] specific combinations of ingredients
[724.86 - 729.48] working together
[726.32 - 733.26] systematically for specific reasons that
[729.48 - 735.48] only a source above could know
[733.26 - 738.48] the relationships among these
[735.48 - 739.68] ingredients are intricate and unknown to
[738.48 - 741.72] anyone
[739.68 - 743.28] hands down these are the greatest books
[741.72 - 745.62] of health history
[743.28 - 748.26] and science and research will never
[745.62 - 750.42] touch these besides poaching from them
[748.26 - 752.52] but they'll never be able to compete
[750.42 - 756.32] with this for the future this is
[752.52 - 756.32] literally the books for The Chronic Leo
[756.48 - 760.92] until now this knowledge from above has
[758.94 - 764.28] remained untapped so what that means is
[760.92 - 766.32] I sat my ass in my office chair
[764.28 - 768.24] and spirit of compassion said it's time
[766.32 - 770.82] because this is what's happened in the
[768.24 - 772.86] world whom I can only do so much I'm
[770.82 - 774.30] only one person one messenger and spirit
[772.86 - 776.82] of compassion said with just these brain
[774.30 - 779.52] books have to be what they are they have
[776.82 - 783.06] to be that volume is
[779.52 - 784.50] they have to be that jacked up
[783.06 - 787.32] they have to have that much information
[784.50 - 790.94] healing information
[787.32 - 790.94] and we have to get people better
[793.86 - 796.92] so let's go over the brain shot therapy
[795.78 - 800.46] list
[796.92 - 802.08] Holly's Health says I did out my old
[800.46 - 804.30] shot glass you got out your old shot
[802.08 - 805.68] glasses that I used to use for tequila
[804.30 - 809.48] laugh out loud that's actually great
[805.68 - 809.48] though I'm glad you got those ones out
[809.88 - 814.50] it's amazing Michelle says science
[811.92 - 816.42] research needs the ego shifter indeed
[814.50 - 818.22] they do
[816.42 - 820.08] so they do
[818.22 - 821.40] the brain shot therapy list I'll give
[820.08 - 822.66] you a little rundown on that for a
[821.40 - 824.76] second you guys good to see you guys
[822.66 - 828.96] we're live right now brain shot therapy
[824.76 - 831.48] list exposures pathogen exposure brain
[828.96 - 833.10] shot so I'll just I'll just talk a
[831.48 - 836.22] little bit about it too let me find the
[833.10 - 838.02] exposure shots let's just do it pathogen
[836.22 - 840.12] exposure you ready
[838.02 - 843.48] you feel you've been around others who
[840.12 - 846.06] could be contagious due to the Sea
[843.48 - 847.80] the flu or mono
[846.06 - 849.54] you're concerned about having shared
[847.80 - 852.66] bodily fluids with another person
[849.54 - 855.72] through shared glasses bottles food
[852.66 - 857.40] utensils or plates
[855.72 - 859.50] you're concerned about having shared
[857.40 - 862.08] bodily fluids through public restrooms
[859.50 - 864.06] or sexual activity
[862.08 - 865.74] you believe you might have been exposed
[864.06 - 867.42] to foodborne pathogens and you're
[865.74 - 870.60] concerned about getting food poisoning
[867.42 - 872.88] that's just a few powerful reasons why
[870.60 - 874.86] the pathogen exposure right there is
[872.88 - 876.72] there so then boom you said you think
[874.86 - 878.16] you got any kind of exposure and it's
[876.72 - 880.44] like boom you're sending down the
[878.16 - 883.02] pathogen exposure now I'm going to talk
[880.44 - 885.48] about toxic heavy metals on the brain
[883.02 - 886.98] hence in the brain we're going to go
[885.48 - 888.12] into that in a couple of minutes but I
[886.98 - 890.28] just wanted to give you guys a quick
[888.12 - 892.62] rundown on some of the different okay
[890.28 - 895.02] mold exposure right there so the mold
[892.62 - 896.58] exposure shots
[895.02 - 898.92] now
[896.58 - 901.20] I said this the other day if this is the
[898.92 - 903.00] only reason why you buy it by the brain
[901.20 - 904.38] books or get them free in the library
[903.00 - 908.22] when they're in the library or whatever
[904.38 - 910.26] if this is the only time you get the
[908.22 - 911.52] brain you know only reason the mold
[910.26 - 913.08] exposure then let it be the mold
[911.52 - 915.78] exposure like
[913.08 - 918.12] that alone is worth having these in your
[915.78 - 920.34] hand to know this so the mold exposure
[918.12 - 922.14] shop a helpful shot for any kind of mold
[920.34 - 924.00] or mildew exposure including when you
[922.14 - 925.62] have been visiting or living in a moldy
[924.00 - 927.84] house or building
[925.62 - 929.48] working in a moldy office or other
[927.84 - 932.40] workplace
[929.48 - 933.54] inhaling mold off another person's
[932.40 - 934.92] clothing
[933.54 - 936.42] people don't realize it but they're
[934.92 - 938.04] inhaling mold on other people's clothing
[936.42 - 939.36] you go into the store you're inhaling
[938.04 - 941.70] all their mold and mildew off their
[939.36 - 944.10] clothing from their home right
[941.70 - 946.20] consuming water contain contaminated
[944.10 - 948.72] with mildew or mold spores or eating
[946.20 - 951.00] moldy food that's when you bring out the
[948.72 - 952.80] mold exposure shot you're like boom you
[951.00 - 955.50] bring that out boom you got your shot
[952.80 - 958.88] glass boom you get that quick hit that
[955.50 - 958.88] really boom you send it down
[959.10 - 964.20] I know a lot of people are worried about
[960.54 - 965.88] EMF and 5G it's like 5G what about 5G aw
[964.20 - 968.04] what about 5G I've been hearing it right
[965.88 - 970.74] for years
[968.04 - 972.90] so I got an EMF and 5G exposure shot
[970.74 - 975.54] which is really powerful on its own
[972.90 - 977.76] try this shot
[975.54 - 980.09] if you spend a lot of time on computers
[977.76 - 982.80] and computerized devices hmm
[980.09 - 985.26] [Applause]
[982.80 - 986.94] spend a lot of time on computers and
[985.26 - 988.50] computerized devices
[986.94 - 990.48] so it's like yeah you better believe it
[988.50 - 992.88] gonna be doing that shot
[990.48 - 994.80] or if you live near a high voltage area
[992.88 - 996.72] a lot of people live near high voltage
[994.80 - 999.12] areas
[996.72 - 999.82] spend time talking or texting on cell
[999.12 - 1001.28] phones like
[999.82 - 1004.34] [Music]
[1001.28 - 1006.38] right traveling by plane this is a great
[1004.34 - 1008.48] time to take this shot send this shot
[1006.38 - 1010.46] glass down right
[1008.48 - 1013.16] live or work close to others while
[1010.46 - 1016.28] they're using devices spend your day
[1013.16 - 1019.28] within several feet of a router
[1016.28 - 1021.02] live near a cell tower
[1019.28 - 1023.54] all those are the reasons right there
[1021.02 - 1025.16] for the brain shot therapy EMF and 5G
[1023.54 - 1026.84] exposure now we're going to be talking
[1025.16 - 1028.16] about the toxic metal stuff let's go
[1026.84 - 1029.90] into that right now I just wanted to
[1028.16 - 1033.32] give you guys just a couple of the 30
[1029.90 - 1036.80] shots now we have 30 shots brain shot
[1033.32 - 1039.14] therapy we have seven brain shot therapy
[1036.80 - 1041.66] cleanses actual cleanses you can do with
[1039.14 - 1043.22] the shots which is really cool all on
[1041.66 - 1045.50] its own
[1043.22 - 1047.84] so that's really exciting
[1045.50 - 1050.42] so we're in the medical medium heavy
[1047.84 - 1051.56] metal detox now I talk about Metals
[1050.42 - 1054.02] throughout the book in various places
[1051.56 - 1056.00] and throughout the protocols book too so
[1054.02 - 1057.98] right there so I'm in the brain saver
[1056.00 - 1059.36] book you guys are getting some of your
[1057.98 - 1060.98] books right you guys are excited that's
[1059.36 - 1062.54] the protocols book let me just put that
[1060.98 - 1063.98] out in the front a little bit so you can
[1062.54 - 1065.96] see it
[1063.98 - 1069.02] both these books equally powerful
[1065.96 - 1071.90] equally packed with information equally
[1069.02 - 1075.26] important both of them they were one
[1071.90 - 1077.00] book and they had to become two they
[1075.26 - 1081.58] were too big it was too big for one book
[1077.00 - 1081.58] to publish to print way too big
[1081.68 - 1085.22] medical medium heavy metal detox so I
[1083.90 - 1088.46] want to just mention something about
[1085.22 - 1090.86] here this is mind-blowing information
[1088.46 - 1093.26] from above
[1090.86 - 1094.82] now medical medium information is always
[1093.26 - 1097.10] the most advanced with toxic heavy
[1094.82 - 1099.14] metals and always has been in fact it
[1097.10 - 1101.48] paved the way fact
[1099.14 - 1104.12] it paved the way for the metal
[1101.48 - 1106.46] information that we have now
[1104.12 - 1108.98] including the dental stuff
[1106.46 - 1110.60] I remember over 30 years ago being in a
[1108.98 - 1112.28] dental conference is actually trying to
[1110.60 - 1113.84] forewarn and tell people about those
[1112.28 - 1116.48] Mercury amalgams
[1113.84 - 1118.46] and I got the crap beat out of me for it
[1116.48 - 1119.84] because no one was against the Mercury
[1118.46 - 1121.58] malcolms they are filling people see
[1119.84 - 1123.14] they do it now they even have that for
[1121.58 - 1126.08] now for people's teeth they offer it but
[1123.14 - 1129.74] the point is it was considered fine and
[1126.08 - 1132.50] not harmful and I really took quite a uh
[1129.74 - 1133.94] bashing for fighting for that one and
[1132.50 - 1135.38] fighting for that one and traveling
[1133.94 - 1136.22] around the country and fighting for that
[1135.38 - 1138.32] one
[1136.22 - 1139.94] a long time ago so that people aren't
[1138.32 - 1143.12] getting Mercury fillings today in their
[1139.94 - 1144.68] teeth so medical medium was a big part
[1143.12 - 1148.04] of making sure that people aren't
[1144.68 - 1150.98] getting still those fillings right so
[1148.04 - 1153.44] but this is really incredible here this
[1150.98 - 1156.20] information here so minus that
[1153.44 - 1158.18] heavy metals that we inherit have aged
[1156.20 - 1160.22] to them they're old
[1158.18 - 1163.04] that statement alone is critical to know
[1160.22 - 1164.84] that is a powerful statement already a
[1163.04 - 1166.16] piece of information and that's just one
[1164.84 - 1169.16] line
[1166.16 - 1171.74] of this Advanced information one line
[1169.16 - 1173.96] heavy metals that we inherit we inherit
[1171.74 - 1175.58] in our family lines you guys passed down
[1173.96 - 1178.28] from generation to generation to
[1175.58 - 1180.62] generation right
[1178.28 - 1182.54] they have aged to them
[1180.62 - 1184.70] just think about that for a second
[1182.54 - 1186.68] the metal in your system
[1184.70 - 1188.60] is old
[1186.68 - 1190.76] think about that
[1188.60 - 1192.44] the metal in your brain
[1190.76 - 1194.96] giving you your schizophrenia your
[1192.44 - 1196.76] bipolar diagnosis your OCD your
[1194.96 - 1198.74] depersonalization your depression your
[1196.76 - 1201.56] anxiety and all the other stuff ADHD
[1198.74 - 1204.26] your autism all these things we get the
[1201.56 - 1206.66] medical medium first let the world know
[1204.26 - 1207.68] causes those conditions those Metals so
[1206.66 - 1209.18] when you hear it out there it was
[1207.68 - 1211.58] poached here
[1209.18 - 1214.16] heavy metals that we inherit have aged
[1211.58 - 1215.96] to them they're old many times going
[1214.16 - 1217.52] back as far as two thousand to three
[1215.96 - 1219.14] thousand years so that means the toxic
[1217.52 - 1221.96] heavy metals that are being passed down
[1219.14 - 1224.78] from generation to generation
[1221.96 - 1226.58] could be two to three thousand years old
[1224.78 - 1228.76] in your family line going all the way
[1226.58 - 1228.76] back
[1230.00 - 1233.48] you'll be hearing this once these books
[1232.04 - 1234.92] are out out you'll be hearing this
[1233.48 - 1236.18] everywhere you'll hear it on podcast
[1234.92 - 1239.18] you'll hear it in different places they
[1236.18 - 1240.74] won't cite where it comes from
[1239.18 - 1242.36] check this out
[1240.74 - 1244.64] depending on what part of the world
[1242.36 - 1245.78] someone's bloodline stems from too so
[1244.64 - 1248.72] ready
[1245.78 - 1250.52] older heavy metals also have a higher
[1248.72 - 1252.86] oxidative rate than heavy metals from
[1250.52 - 1254.48] newer exposures that's another sentence
[1252.86 - 1255.74] in this book now take a look at both
[1254.48 - 1257.72] these books
[1255.74 - 1260.66] and the sizes of these books you guys
[1257.72 - 1264.62] are getting them now in the mail okay
[1260.66 - 1266.72] I read you two sentences
[1264.62 - 1269.54] that are so far advanced in information
[1266.72 - 1272.66] and mind-blowing
[1269.54 - 1275.12] two sentences right check this out
[1272.66 - 1277.34] older heavy metals also have a higher
[1275.12 - 1279.02] oxidative rate than heavy metals from
[1277.34 - 1280.58] newer exposures now first of all how
[1279.02 - 1281.60] would we know they even oxidized well
[1280.58 - 1283.64] that's medical medium information
[1281.60 - 1285.50] originally but you you'll hear it out
[1283.64 - 1289.22] there now
[1285.50 - 1291.98] the older Metals oxidize faster they
[1289.22 - 1293.54] have a higher rate of oxidation now that
[1291.98 - 1297.80] means if you have these old inherited
[1293.54 - 1300.32] Metals it's oxide oxidizing faster
[1297.80 - 1302.12] send you into Alzheimer's dementia
[1300.32 - 1303.32] depression anxiety whatever it's sending
[1302.12 - 1305.92] you into all kinds of different
[1303.32 - 1305.92] conditions
[1306.38 - 1312.50] the aging process of toxic heavy metals
[1309.62 - 1315.62] that were mined mined meaning mind from
[1312.50 - 1318.50] the earth dug out of the earth machines
[1315.62 - 1322.04] digging it out right people digging it
[1318.50 - 1324.26] out throughout throughout time
[1322.04 - 1327.22] the aging process of toxic heavy metals
[1324.26 - 1329.72] that were mined many generations ago
[1327.22 - 1331.10] started when the metals were removed
[1329.72 - 1332.84] from the earth now this is something
[1331.10 - 1334.52] science and research has no idea about
[1332.84 - 1336.62] neither does any
[1334.52 - 1338.66] professional or a podcast doctor or
[1336.62 - 1341.30] whoever or somebody in Harvard or
[1338.66 - 1343.64] whatever they don't know this they don't
[1341.30 - 1346.10] know that when a toxic heavy metal was
[1343.64 - 1348.74] removed from the earth a thousand years
[1346.10 - 1350.84] ago 200 years ago 500 years ago it
[1348.74 - 1352.40] already started oxidizing because oxygen
[1350.84 - 1354.86] hit it
[1352.40 - 1356.78] oxygen hit it
[1354.86 - 1359.78] it was pulled out of the Earth where
[1356.78 - 1361.82] there was no oxygen it was mined out of
[1359.78 - 1363.86] the Earth
[1361.82 - 1366.26] you see how mind-blowing this is when I
[1363.86 - 1368.36] heard this from Spirit of compassion and
[1366.26 - 1371.18] I was trying to get this in the books
[1368.36 - 1372.98] like I was just like okay I gotta sit
[1371.18 - 1374.48] back with that one for a second oh my
[1372.98 - 1375.74] God I got to sit back with that one for
[1374.48 - 1379.18] a second
[1375.74 - 1379.18] think about how advanced it is
[1379.46 - 1384.02] so when the toxic heavy metal was mined
[1381.98 - 1388.34] out of the earth like Mercury a thousand
[1384.02 - 1391.34] years ago it already started to oxidize
[1388.34 - 1391.34] whoa
[1393.20 - 1397.88] an oxidative countdown occurred so it
[1395.60 - 1400.34] was a countdown then the countdown
[1397.88 - 1402.74] started one Mississippi two Mississippi
[1400.34 - 1404.96] three Mississippi four it started when
[1402.74 - 1407.18] it was mined out of the Earth
[1404.96 - 1409.94] a countdown occurred as Metals aged
[1407.18 - 1413.42] those Metals became highly unstable when
[1409.94 - 1416.36] they entered and sat inside human bodies
[1413.42 - 1418.70] where metals are exposed to more oxygen
[1416.36 - 1420.26] acids heat blood gases electricity
[1418.70 - 1421.94] outside chemicals and more so when a
[1420.26 - 1424.70] metal sits inside your body you guys
[1421.94 - 1428.00] it's exposed to oxygen inside your body
[1424.70 - 1430.82] acids heat blood gases electricity
[1428.00 - 1432.92] inside your body
[1430.82 - 1435.68] and more
[1432.92 - 1437.72] so the older Metals pulled out of the
[1435.68 - 1440.42] Earth the countdown of oxidation already
[1437.72 - 1442.28] occurred then it got into the human body
[1440.42 - 1444.56] that's the whole point it got into us
[1442.28 - 1446.18] what do you think the Emperors of China
[1444.56 - 1449.12] they were all poison to death because
[1446.18 - 1451.82] the medicine in Chinese medicine culture
[1449.12 - 1453.86] was Mercury
[1451.82 - 1456.34] it was Mercury
[1453.86 - 1458.26] everybody thinks it was this ingenious
[1456.34 - 1461.78] natural
[1458.26 - 1464.00] mushrooms it wasn't it was Mercury
[1461.78 - 1466.88] that was their number one medicine up
[1464.00 - 1469.16] until the 1800s was mercury in early
[1466.88 - 1471.38] 1900s actually
[1469.16 - 1473.90] so in Chinese medicine culture it was
[1471.38 - 1476.30] Mercury to give you that was that was
[1473.90 - 1479.18] the whole point it was all Mercury and
[1476.30 - 1481.40] so it gets passed on down but Mercury
[1479.18 - 1484.40] was used in all cultures around the
[1481.40 - 1486.62] world eventually as medicine so Mercury
[1484.40 - 1488.12] got into all cultures around the world
[1486.62 - 1491.06] right
[1488.12 - 1493.34] it's important to know
[1491.06 - 1494.60] new Metals differ greatly from old
[1493.34 - 1496.82] metals
[1494.60 - 1499.40] newer Metals differ greatly from old
[1496.82 - 1500.96] Metals new metal exposure you guys the
[1499.40 - 1502.76] new metal exposures you're getting all
[1500.96 - 1504.68] the time like copper you want to drink
[1502.76 - 1507.38] out of the copper cups the new fancy
[1504.68 - 1508.88] copper cups now right the thermoses
[1507.38 - 1513.44] whatever that are made out of copper
[1508.88 - 1516.50] it's that's NuMe heavy metal exposure
[1513.44 - 1517.82] newer Metals recently mined that's new
[1516.50 - 1521.36] copper
[1517.82 - 1522.74] that's new steel new copper new aluminum
[1521.36 - 1525.44] whatever it's just all the different
[1522.74 - 1527.24] Metals it's new newer Metals recently
[1525.44 - 1528.98] mined and taken out of the Earth are
[1527.24 - 1531.38] still highly toxic although they are
[1528.98 - 1533.42] more stable here's the thing so newer
[1531.38 - 1535.22] toxic heavy metal exposure still causes
[1533.42 - 1537.20] problems and makes us sick but it's more
[1535.22 - 1539.84] stable it's more stable than the older
[1537.20 - 1541.88] metals making them less destructive is
[1539.84 - 1544.04] older Metals but you have to get this
[1541.88 - 1545.48] though check out this you guys I'm in
[1544.04 - 1546.92] the brain saver books if you just got
[1545.48 - 1550.78] here
[1546.92 - 1550.78] lock down a copy when you can
[1551.36 - 1554.96] foreign
[1552.74 - 1556.82] newer Metals don't break down inside the
[1554.96 - 1559.28] body as quickly it all depends on how
[1556.82 - 1561.62] many generations the metals have been
[1559.28 - 1564.44] passed down through and how much metal
[1561.62 - 1566.18] is in each individual most people have a
[1564.44 - 1567.98] mix of older metals and newer metals and
[1566.18 - 1571.34] it brings us to another part here most
[1567.98 - 1573.70] people who are sick depersonalization
[1571.34 - 1576.14] depression 10 different ways to Sunday
[1573.70 - 1578.96] anxiety and panic 10 different ways to
[1576.14 - 1581.60] Sunday bipolar any other kind of of
[1578.96 - 1583.94] diagnosis all of it
[1581.60 - 1586.46] is metals
[1583.94 - 1588.08] but a blend of newer and older the
[1586.46 - 1590.24] newest metal exposure is when a child
[1588.08 - 1592.28] gets something
[1590.24 - 1595.46] can't read that in you can't read that
[1592.28 - 1598.82] you guys I have to not read any of that
[1595.46 - 1600.68] out here you gotta check out the book
[1598.82 - 1602.48] most likely the Mercury and aluminum
[1600.68 - 1604.28] were Unearthed in the last 50 to 70
[1602.48 - 1606.56] years so here's the problem too so any
[1604.28 - 1608.60] kind of new toxic heavy metal exposure
[1606.56 - 1610.52] that you guys are getting it's been
[1608.60 - 1612.26] mined out of the earth 50 to 70 years
[1610.52 - 1617.02] ago
[1612.26 - 1617.02] so 50 to 70 years ago
[1617.78 - 1621.44] saved in storage and eventually
[1619.40 - 1623.48] purchased by a medical industry or a
[1621.44 - 1625.76] place inside a pharmaceutical or some
[1623.48 - 1627.80] other kind of industry many medications
[1625.76 - 1629.66] have toxic heavy metals in them and at
[1627.80 - 1631.64] the same time
[1629.66 - 1633.92] can't read you the rest of that
[1631.64 - 1636.62] not on here
[1633.92 - 1639.20] anyway bottom line you guys were talking
[1636.62 - 1641.24] about Advanced information detailed
[1639.20 - 1642.80] comprehensive just about metals that
[1641.24 - 1645.56] nobody knows science of research or
[1642.80 - 1648.38] anywhere else that's critical to know
[1645.56 - 1650.60] and we're in it we're in the brain saver

[1776.48 - 1779.66] the surface we're just talking about a
[1778.10 - 1781.76] little bit about heavy metals inside the
[1779.66 - 1783.92] brain we're talking about old Metals
[1781.76 - 1785.84] versus newer metals and then people
[1783.92 - 1787.82] having a combination and how it works
[1785.84 - 1789.38] oxidation and all of that and that leads
[1787.82 - 1791.24] obviously to so many conditions and
[1789.38 - 1792.86] symptoms
