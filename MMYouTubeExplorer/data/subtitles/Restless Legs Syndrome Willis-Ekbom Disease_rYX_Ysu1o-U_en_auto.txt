[0.72 - 5.76] syndrome and the Brain saver books
[3.56 - 9.00] comprehensive detailed information about
[5.76 - 11.34] restless legs so let's get into it
[9.00 - 12.84] restless leg syndrome often when
[11.34 - 15.06] addressing restless legs medical
[12.84 - 17.28] communities start with the legs first
[15.06 - 18.66] are you cramping
[17.28 - 20.40] what's going on with your legs do you
[18.66 - 22.32] need leg massage do you need to lift
[20.40 - 25.26] your legs up maybe your problems in your
[22.32 - 27.42] legs but it's not right they'll ask
[25.26 - 29.46] could that be the problem it's just a
[27.42 - 32.04] leg problem try putting a pillow between
[29.46 - 34.56] your legs when you sleep that'll fix it
[32.04 - 36.72] how about that or the last how's your
[34.56 - 39.96] bed and your mattress go out and buy
[36.72 - 42.30] another 500 mattress or 300 400 whatever
[39.96 - 44.28] it is dollar mattress and replace your
[42.30 - 46.50] mattress that'll fix your restless legs
[44.28 - 48.24] or your legs comfortable are they
[46.50 - 50.88] supporting your lower back when you lie
[48.24 - 52.38] down that's the problem you know experts
[50.88 - 53.88] will be like maybe you just need a
[52.38 - 55.44] little bit more support when you're in
[53.88 - 56.94] bed maybe you could put your leg up
[55.44 - 59.34] maybe you got your pillows between your
[56.94 - 61.38] knees or right there a whole bit okay
[59.34 - 63.42] how are your feet maybe your restless
[61.38 - 65.10] leg syndrome is just your feet maybe you
[63.42 - 67.32] got a feet problem you need to go and
[65.10 - 70.02] try on some new shoes supportive shoes
[67.32 - 72.18] do the shoes fit right do they have
[70.02 - 73.92] enough padding are they the problem or
[72.18 - 75.78] is one leg shorter than the other and
[73.92 - 77.46] everybody says hey my leg is an inch
[75.78 - 78.54] shorter than the other leg my legs I
[77.46 - 80.94] have been shorter than the other leg
[78.54 - 83.76] that must be my restless legs and then
[80.94 - 85.98] so on so on if looking at the place
[83.76 - 88.62] where the symptoms are felt doesn't
[85.98 - 92.16] yield results then the doctor may move
[88.62 - 93.54] on is it in your mind is your mind too
[92.16 - 96.24] active at night are you giving
[93.54 - 98.10] yourselves restless leg syndrome so then
[96.24 - 99.72] you go through that whole thing is your
[98.10 - 102.72] mind too active when you're trying to
[99.72 - 104.28] sleep read a book read a book before you
[102.72 - 106.80] go to bed right you might hear that
[104.28 - 109.38] maybe light a candle and take a bath
[106.80 - 112.14] listen to some calming music you'll hear
[109.38 - 115.26] as advice consider taking magnesium for
[112.14 - 117.96] your legs if none of this helps often
[115.26 - 120.60] patients are told it's time for an MRI
[117.96 - 122.88] on their lower back to investigate for
[120.60 - 126.30] degenerative disc problems or a bulging
[122.88 - 127.74] disc and if this all checks out even if
[126.30 - 129.36] there is something like a bulging disc
[127.74 - 131.88] doesn't mean that's a restless legs if
[129.36 - 133.86] this doesn't check out or checks out no
[131.88 - 135.96] signs of structural spine issue the
[133.86 - 137.40] restless legs will be considered a
[135.96 - 139.86] medical mystery and that's the whole
[137.40 - 142.44] point with restless legs it becomes a
[139.86 - 145.02] medical mystery everybody thinks science
[142.44 - 146.40] research is really advanced but they
[145.02 - 148.38] don't even know the cause of restless
[146.40 - 150.90] legs even here it's detailed
[148.38 - 153.00] comprehensive information let's go on a
[150.90 - 155.04] little further if looking at the place
[153.00 - 157.20] where the symptoms are felt does it
[155.04 - 159.60] yield those results instantly now we're
[157.20 - 162.00] at the medical Mystery World and that's
[159.60 - 164.70] really interesting so and here's the
[162.00 - 168.54] other point that's interesting too
[164.70 - 170.88] if there's no signs of anything wrong
[168.54 - 172.50] your feet your legs you tried everything
[170.88 - 174.42] you tried the pillows you tried the
[172.50 - 177.66] shoes you went to the doctor you got
[174.42 - 179.70] massage therapy it's not a mystery when
[177.66 - 181.68] you look at the brain saver books it's a
[179.70 - 183.30] medical mystery out there but detailed
[181.68 - 186.06] information in here of what's really
[183.30 - 187.92] going on is really incredible here there
[186.06 - 190.08] are some neural neurologists these days
[187.92 - 191.58] who will start looking into the brain a
[190.08 - 193.26] little bit now I've seen that out there
[191.58 - 195.60] because of the medical medium books
[193.26 - 197.16] being out now for eight years they're
[195.60 - 200.52] starting to look at the brain a little
[197.16 - 202.86] bit right but even if the MRI and the
[200.52 - 206.10] brain look normal there's nothing
[202.86 - 208.32] abnormal there then where do they go
[206.10 - 211.08] from there the true cause of restless
[208.32 - 213.36] legs wouldn't it would not appear on the
[211.08 - 215.82] MRI so let's go into that if you get an
[213.36 - 217.32] MRI you're getting the restless legs for
[215.82 - 219.12] like a year and it's bothering you you
[217.32 - 220.80] tried everything you go to the doctor
[219.12 - 223.68] the neurologist says let's look in the
[220.80 - 226.26] brain they do an MRI they look for your
[223.68 - 228.66] brain it looks pretty good nothing
[226.26 - 231.66] really is terribly wrong in here okay
[228.66 - 236.94] everything is checking out the brain
[231.66 - 239.46] looks good nothing abnormal then
[236.94 - 241.56] they're going to be like okay let's try
[239.46 - 244.08] to go a different route let's go with
[241.56 - 245.82] sleep medications let's start going with
[244.08 - 249.84] different Pharmaceuticals they start
[245.82 - 252.60] heading to that that place the true
[249.84 - 254.64] cause of restless legs won't show up so
[252.60 - 257.82] then they'll offer hey here's some sleep
[254.64 - 259.68] aid here's a sleep drug have you tried
[257.82 - 261.90] this have you tried that so then it's
[259.68 - 263.88] going on to different places maybe you
[261.90 - 266.52] got anxiety a lot of people with
[263.88 - 267.72] restless legs are blamed on anxiety so
[266.52 - 269.82] they're like well I don't know if it's
[267.72 - 272.52] anxiety but maybe it is and now they're
[269.82 - 275.58] taking anti-anxiety it's true you know
[272.52 - 277.80] as well even if the scan showed a brain
[275.58 - 280.14] tumor it wouldn't mean that that's the
[277.80 - 281.82] cause and I run into that every now and
[280.14 - 285.00] then throughout like talking to doctors
[281.82 - 287.34] a doctor would be like hey aw there's a
[285.00 - 289.08] brain tumor in my patient you know is
[287.34 - 290.46] that causing the restless legs and well
[289.08 - 291.96] first of all let's try to get rid of the
[290.46 - 293.76] restless legs they get rid of the
[291.96 - 296.34] restless legs and it turns out the brain
[293.76 - 297.84] tumor wasn't causing the restless legs
[296.34 - 300.42] so
[297.84 - 301.50] so even if someone has a lower back
[300.42 - 303.72] issue
[301.50 - 305.46] it doesn't mean the lower back issue is
[303.72 - 307.20] the problem too someone could have a
[305.46 - 309.90] bulging disc they could have a spine
[307.20 - 311.46] issue they can have a sciatic nerve
[309.90 - 313.68] problem they can have a degenerative
[311.46 - 315.36] disc issue something can be wrong in
[313.68 - 317.22] their lower spine right here and it
[315.36 - 320.22] doesn't mean that that's actually
[317.22 - 322.02] causing their restless legs so that's
[320.22 - 323.88] another problem on its own so now you're
[322.02 - 325.14] at the chiropractor and the chiropractor
[323.88 - 326.52] is trying to do all kinds of stuff
[325.14 - 329.40] saying well man
[326.52 - 331.14] you know well sir your restless legs
[329.40 - 332.76] probably because we're seeing there's an
[331.14 - 335.04] inconsistency right here in your lower
[332.76 - 337.08] spine in your lumbar or your thoracic
[335.04 - 339.30] area that must be where your restless
[337.08 - 342.24] legs are so they start searching in
[339.30 - 343.62] those areas but even with that visiting
[342.24 - 346.14] your chiropractor over and over again
[343.62 - 347.82] visiting your massage therapist you've
[346.14 - 350.64] been to the doctor you've had your MRIs
[347.82 - 352.38] you've had a lot of things done and
[350.64 - 356.22] looked at and you're still suffering
[352.38 - 358.08] with restless legs let's go into now the
[356.22 - 359.76] nitty-gritty and some details right here
[358.08 - 362.88] so we're in brand saver talk about
[359.76 - 366.48] restless legs you guys restless legs can
[362.88 - 368.70] come from two places ah
[366.48 - 370.80] first is the shingles virus releasing
[368.70 - 373.14] neurotoxins that affect the lower spine
[370.80 - 376.20] so let's head there
[373.14 - 379.02] shingles virus likes to sit around the
[376.20 - 381.30] lower spine for a lot of people it's
[379.02 - 383.76] likes to Harbor in this area the
[381.30 - 386.76] shingles virus can Nest itself in
[383.76 - 389.40] connective tissue around the lower spine
[386.76 - 392.58] then release neurotoxins these
[389.40 - 395.10] neurotoxins can then inflame the sciatic
[392.58 - 398.46] nerve other nerves too so the shingles
[395.10 - 402.66] virus without having the pustules like
[398.46 - 404.52] the rash can cause those restless legs
[402.66 - 406.80] this is one of the Undiscovered
[404.52 - 409.08] mysteries of restless legs which is the
[406.80 - 412.02] neurotoxins created by the shingles
[409.08 - 414.36] virus produced by the shingles virus
[412.02 - 416.16] sitting inside the liver is is another
[414.36 - 418.68] problem so the shingles virus doesn't
[416.16 - 420.96] just harbor around the lower spine the
[418.68 - 423.12] shingles virus likes to sit around the
[420.96 - 425.46] liver too so not just the lower spine
[423.12 - 428.94] shingles virus likes to sit around the
[425.46 - 431.58] liver as well inside the liver producing
[428.94 - 435.00] neurotoxins and those neurotoxins start
[431.58 - 436.56] to gum up and fill up the liver so when
[435.00 - 438.30] that liver gets filled with neurotoxins
[436.56 - 440.70] we have another problem
[438.30 - 442.74] so the liver can settle in different
[440.70 - 444.32] places the neurotoxins can settle in
[442.74 - 447.18] different places inside the liver
[444.32 - 448.74] depending on what those neurotoxins are
[447.18 - 450.60] filled with so here's the incredible
[448.74 - 452.82] piece of information too right here in
[450.60 - 453.72] brain saver so we're in the details you
[452.82 - 457.02] guys
[453.72 - 459.72] higher amounts of lead and copper being
[457.02 - 462.72] consumed by the shingles virus will
[459.72 - 467.04] result in a heavier neurotoxin so check
[462.72 - 471.42] this out if the virus is feeding off of
[467.04 - 475.56] different Metals it can actually create
[471.42 - 477.72] a heavier neurotoxin so if the virus is
[475.56 - 481.26] sitting here feeding off of different
[477.72 - 483.96] Metals it could then produce a waste
[481.26 - 486.66] that comes out of the shingles virus but
[483.96 - 489.60] a waste that's heavier and when that
[486.66 - 492.18] waste is heavier check this out this is
[489.60 - 494.82] incredible really this is how you become
[492.18 - 496.86] your own expert right here
[494.82 - 499.32] if higher amounts of lead and copper
[496.86 - 502.02] being consumed by the shingles virus are
[499.32 - 505.56] happening then those heavier neurotoxins
[502.02 - 507.54] tend to settle in lower areas
[505.56 - 509.94] they'll often drop into the lower back
[507.54 - 512.52] legs and feet irritating the nerves and
[509.94 - 515.58] creating subtle spasms so if you have
[512.52 - 517.50] certain toxic heavy metals and the
[515.58 - 520.50] shingles virus is feeding off of those
[517.50 - 523.38] Metals those metals neurotoxins are
[520.50 - 525.78] being released they settle in lower
[523.38 - 528.48] areas of the body
[525.78 - 531.18] feet the legs the lower back irritating
[528.48 - 534.30] the nerves creating nerve spasms giving
[531.18 - 536.64] somebody restless legs signs of research
[534.30 - 538.32] is probably 50 60 years from knowing
[536.64 - 540.54] this information maybe even a hundred
[538.32 - 542.34] years some varieties of Epstein-Barr can
[540.54 - 545.04] also create these heavier types of
[542.34 - 547.68] neurotoxins as well so Epstein-Barr can
[545.04 - 549.66] create heavy neurotoxins people can have
[547.68 - 552.24] restless legs all day long while
[549.66 - 555.24] standing and working or sitting and not
[552.24 - 556.56] realize it until they're still or lying
[555.24 - 558.78] down for the night so let's talk about
[556.56 - 561.18] that are you somebody with restless leg
[558.78 - 564.12] syndrome when it's at night and you're
[561.18 - 566.46] trying to sleep but during the day when
[564.12 - 569.22] you're working moving around working in
[566.46 - 571.38] the kitchen maybe doing your job it's
[569.22 - 573.24] not bothering you like where's your
[571.38 - 575.16] restless leg syndrome so here you are
[573.24 - 577.38] you're living your life it's during the
[575.16 - 579.42] day you're working you're in the kitchen
[577.38 - 581.52] washing stuff you're doing things you're
[579.42 - 583.86] doing the laundry you're walking around
[581.52 - 586.86] the house where's your restless legs is
[583.86 - 590.70] it there or is it not but then when you
[586.86 - 592.68] lay down and it's sleep time you get the
[590.70 - 595.08] restless legs
[592.68 - 597.54] so people can have the restless legs all
[595.08 - 599.52] day long while standing working or
[597.54 - 602.10] sitting and not realize it until they're
[599.52 - 604.08] still are laying down for the night
[602.10 - 606.18] here's the other way restless legs can
[604.08 - 609.36] occur viral neurotoxins filled the same
[606.18 - 610.98] methylated metals can enter the brain so
[609.36 - 613.44] then we can get
[610.98 - 616.44] a restless leg syndrome some viral
[613.44 - 618.42] neurotoxins entering the brain
[616.44 - 620.34] that's a whole nother level of
[618.42 - 622.26] neurotoxins you guys there's so much
[620.34 - 624.06] information in here I'm just cutting
[622.26 - 626.58] into some of some it's you know
[624.06 - 629.46] scratching the surface restless legs
[626.58 - 632.46] protocol is in this book right here
[629.46 - 634.68] so there are two books two big books
[632.46 - 636.24] couldn't be published as one big book it
[634.68 - 637.68] was too big too much comprehensive
[636.24 - 640.86] information
[637.68 - 643.62] seven heavy metal detox cleanses over
[640.86 - 646.62] 300 symptoms conditions and protocols
[643.62 - 648.24] brain shot therapies and I'm just
[646.62 - 649.86] scratching the surface of these books I
[648.24 - 652.20] mean there's meditations in these books
[649.86 - 654.90] there's so much information it's so
[652.20 - 656.64] comprehensive your mind will be blown
[654.90 - 659.34] when you get into this but I will tell
[656.64 - 661.68] you right now be prepared to become an
[659.34 - 664.20] expert so nobody owns you you're not
[661.68 - 666.54] controlled by anybody you become
[664.20 - 668.88] empowered because you have the answers
[666.54 - 672.80] you have the details your mind's going
[668.88 - 672.80] to be blown are you ready for it
