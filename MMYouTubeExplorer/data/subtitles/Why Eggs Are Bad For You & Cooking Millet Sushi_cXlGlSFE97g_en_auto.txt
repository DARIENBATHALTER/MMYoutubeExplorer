[40.84 - 46.96] true or eggs can't be bad or I raise my
[44.20 - 49.76] own eggs in the backyard and I have a
[46.96 - 52.04] chicken shed or I've been getting fresh
[49.76 - 55.00] eggs from my neighbor for 20 years and

[102.32 - 109.32] it all right two cups of millet is what
[106.64 - 112.68] I'm going to do for four cups
[109.32 - 115.76] of water there's one cup of
[112.68 - 118.28] millet let's go into two cups of millet
[115.76 - 120.72] so what I'm going to do is try to scoop
[118.28 - 122.36] this nice big one right there there and
[120.72 - 125.28] I'm going to add a little bit more just
[122.36 - 127.96] to make sure we're up to par two cups of
[125.28 - 129.88] millet right there incredible what's the
[127.96 - 132.88] Millet for the Millet is for the sushi
[129.88 - 135.44] it takes place of rice in the sushi as
[132.88 - 137.48] you can see right here in the Brain saer
[135.44 - 140.40] book if you guys just got on here I just
[137.48 - 142.60] want to forewarn you this is a show
[140.40 - 144.84] about why eggs are bad for you and I
[142.60 - 147.44] don't want you getting upset I don't
[144.84 - 149.56] want you getting mad and some people are
[147.44 - 151.44] just going to be like talking all kinds
[149.56 - 154.00] of crazy like how dare you my
[151.44 - 156.48] grandmother's 103 years old and she ate
[154.00 - 158.60] eggs her whole life so there's no reason
[156.48 - 160.44] why we should be able to eat them I get
[158.60 - 162.64] it I know what you guys are thinking but
[160.44 - 163.96] we're going to cover it and cover how
[162.64 - 167.36] things
[163.96 - 170.20] work I'm even nervous how about that I'm
[167.36 - 173.12] even nervous who would have thought
[170.20 - 174.64] right out of all the things I'm just
[173.12 - 176.76] going to mix this Mill it in here a
[174.64 - 179.32] little bit then I'm going to get a lid
[176.76 - 182.88] on it I want it to simmer and I want to
[179.32 - 185.52] keep a very small mild simmering going
[182.88 - 188.52] on once it hits a
[185.52 - 191.84] boil so I've been making Millet for
[188.52 - 193.76] years more than three decades I like
[191.84 - 196.36] Millet for a lot of just a lot of
[193.76 - 198.96] different recipes it's grain I realize
[196.36 - 201.00] that a lot of people they don't want a
[198.96 - 202.36] grain in their diet I completely
[201.00 - 205.04] understand but like medical medium
[202.36 - 206.12] information goes you can go as far as
[205.04 - 208.64] you
[206.12 - 209.80] want far as you want you can be
[208.64 - 211.88] grainfree
[209.80 - 214.60] you can be on meat you can be on
[211.88 - 216.64] something else but you you can use
[214.60 - 218.52] whatever cauliflower rice the point is
[216.64 - 220.20] medical meme information is about going
[218.52 - 222.80] as far as you need to go when you want
[220.20 - 225.04] to and when you're ready but also
[222.80 - 227.16] certain ingredients like Millet when we
[225.04 - 229.76] can use it if we would like to and so
[227.16 - 231.48] forth I feel it's one of the best grains
[229.76 - 233.72] from the information I've received from
[231.48 - 236.84] my source if you're going to ever have a
[233.72 - 238.52] grain or you can just do cauliflour Rice
[236.84 - 240.68] as well that's an option too and I've
[238.52 - 242.80] done that many times you guys are coming
[240.68 - 245.52] on here we're getting ready for why eggs
[242.80 - 248.08] are bad for you so you got to get ready
[245.52 - 250.40] but I just want to get this Millet to a
[248.08 - 252.68] simmer I want it cooking and we're going
[250.40 - 255.24] to make the Millet Sushi a little later
[252.68 - 258.08] on bring the temp down a little cuz it's
[255.24 - 260.68] about to take a boil I got my Wasabi
[258.08 - 262.96] right here I got my Nori sheets right

[326.88 - 334.72] into it the eggs let's talk about
[331.00 - 336.80] it why are they a problem before we go
[334.72 - 339.72] into it I want to read you a little
[336.80 - 343.12] something really quick
[339.72 - 346.92] okay something that's very
[343.12 - 350.12] interesting living hungry viruses did
[346.92 - 352.84] you know viruses eat did you know all
[350.12 - 356.12] viruses eat did you know viruses have to
[352.84 - 359.60] eat in order to stay alive do you know
[356.12 - 361.72] that when viruses eat they get strong
[359.60 - 366.32] did you know they can
[361.72 - 368.52] multiply you don't believe in viruses no
[366.32 - 370.80] h you know when someone has Simplex
[368.52 - 373.04] herpes one it's on their lip it's the
[370.80 - 376.52] fever blister it's the cold
[373.04 - 379.80] sore right you go and you kiss somebody
[376.52 - 382.56] else or share a glass with somebody and
[379.80 - 385.52] you have that fresh fever blister some
[382.56 - 388.32] people's fever blisters gets pretty
[385.52 - 390.28] gnarly that fever blister can spread to
[388.32 - 392.48] the other person and then a couple of
[390.28 - 394.84] months later or 3 days later depending
[392.48 - 396.60] on the variety of the simplex one or 2
[394.84 - 398.28] years later depending on the variety of
[396.60 - 400.68] simplex one in the person's immune
[398.28 - 402.84] system they will break out with a fever
[400.68 - 406.84] blister and they will have their first
[402.84 - 411.36] cold sore because there are viruses they
[406.84 - 413.32] do exist I want people to heed that
[411.36 - 415.32] understanding and actually realize that
[413.32 - 418.12] when you hear out there viruses don't
[415.32 - 419.60] exist it's all just parasites viruses
[418.12 - 422.64] and bacteria don't exist it's all all
[419.60 - 425.24] just parasites want people to understand
[422.64 - 428.92] it's actually the opposite in the sense
[425.24 - 431.64] where viruses exist hardcore baby it's
[428.92 - 433.32] hardcore they're out there yes you guys
[431.64 - 435.08] probably know that by now before the
[433.32 - 437.24] whole sea thing that happened 3 years
[435.08 - 440.60] ago before before that whole thing that
[437.24 - 442.96] occurred right you know the crazy flu
[440.60 - 444.16] stuff before it all occurred there were
[442.96 - 446.08] a lot of people in health that didn't
[444.16 - 447.68] even believe viruses even existed
[446.08 - 450.36] anywhere and then that whole thing
[447.68 - 452.52] happened in 2020
[450.36 - 453.96] and then boom now even people in the
[452.52 - 455.76] health realm and Alternative Health
[453.96 - 458.12] believe that viruses do exist now
[455.76 - 459.96] there's still a lot of people that don't
[458.12 - 463.76] but they do just like you can catch
[459.96 - 465.56] herpes simplex one just from a glass
[463.76 - 468.08] just from bodily fluids just from
[465.56 - 471.76] kissing someone and they have it too
[468.08 - 473.72] just like you can catch that yes they do
[471.76 - 474.88] exist and they're catchy for the record
[473.72 - 477.72] viruses are
[474.88 - 479.52] living in the publicly known Arena of
[477.72 - 483.56] Science Now I want to just say this this
[479.52 - 487.56] real quick publicly known Arena of
[483.56 - 491.40] science what does that mean it means
[487.56 - 493.68] what public publicly known like a doctor
[491.40 - 494.92] down the road in a practice what he is
[493.68 - 497.80] allowed to
[494.92 - 501.16] know publicly known scientists what
[497.80 - 503.48] they're allowed to know publicly known
[501.16 - 506.00] medical research and science it's just
[503.48 - 509.96] whoever is in the arena of Health what
[506.00 - 511.68] they're allowed to know just so you know
[509.96 - 515.04] there's a battle about whether viruses
[511.68 - 518.48] are dead or alive viruses are alive and
[515.04 - 519.32] viruses are hungry hungry hungry hippos
[518.48 - 522.08] they
[519.32 - 524.08] are no one can agree and neither side
[522.08 - 528.24] has proven facts here's a pillar of
[524.08 - 530.76] Truth viruses are alive viruses are
[528.24 - 532.84] cells viruses eat now if you're
[530.76 - 534.60] wondering where I'm going this is going
[532.84 - 538.36] to be really interesting
[534.60 - 542.88] here I'm going to a place of viruses eat
[538.36 - 545.48] now what does that matter what does that
[542.88 - 547.96] mean and why is he talking about eggs
[545.48 - 550.12] being bad for us give you a quick window
[547.96 - 552.68] really quick into it right now you got
[550.12 - 554.48] an egg right here and you got a virus
[552.68 - 559.92] right
[554.48 - 563.80] here you eat the egg the virus eats the
[559.92 - 567.56] egg you eat the egg the virus inside
[563.80 - 569.64] your body starts to thrive and eat the
[567.56 - 571.80] egg you might be somebody that
[569.64 - 573.80] hey eats eggs for a lot of years I got
[571.80 - 577.84] nothing wrong with me meanwhile you got
[573.80 - 579.80] like ra rheumatoid arthritis meanwhile
[577.84 - 581.88] you have other things too and you get a
[579.80 - 584.60] fever blister once every six months
[581.88 - 588.12] whatever it is what people don't realize
[584.60 - 592.72] is the virus is helping to
[588.12 - 596.56] feed off of the eggs the egg is helping
[592.72 - 599.64] to feed the virus they work together
[596.56 - 602.24] that's what it is they become one the
[599.64 - 604.92] egg helps to feed the virus the virus
[602.24 - 607.92] gets help from the egg and they work
[604.92 - 609.52] together and they work with each other
[607.92 - 612.36] that's how it works so you got to
[609.52 - 615.72] remember that so when we eat eggs it's
[612.36 - 619.12] good to know viruses are involved sure
[615.72 - 623.28] viruses are not on the egg viruses may
[619.12 - 626.56] not be inside the egg but as we eat the
[623.28 - 630.96] egg viruses inside of us we'll start
[626.56 - 633.24] feeding and eating the egg egg that's a
[630.96 - 635.20] simple explanation in the moment but
[633.24 - 637.76] we're going deeper we're going to talk
[635.20 - 639.52] more about it so let's roll a little bit
[637.76 - 641.24] for a virus to live long enough inside
[639.52 - 643.08] the human body to create a chronic
[641.24 - 646.44] symptom or condition it has to be able
[643.08 - 649.44] to find food and sustain itself viruses
[646.44 - 652.20] sustain themselves by fi finding
[649.44 - 653.24] food by consuming things that it likes
[652.20 - 657.84] to
[653.24 - 659.56] eat and eggs are on the top of the
[657.84 - 663.16] list now
[659.56 - 665.16] now eggs are fun to eat they taste good
[663.16 - 667.52] some people swear by them some people
[665.16 - 669.60] say hey they don't hurt my stomach they
[667.52 - 671.56] feel good inside of me we're going to
[669.60 - 673.72] cover that too in a little while of why
[671.56 - 674.96] eggs feel good in people's stomachs and
[673.72 - 677.92] intestinal
[674.96 - 681.00] tracts and how it doesn't seem like a
[677.92 - 682.48] problem when someone eats an egg and
[681.00 - 685.60] we're going to cover the whole chickens
[682.48 - 689.68] behind the house on the farm the Chicken
[685.60 - 691.64] Shack chicken right the p raised eggs
[689.68 - 694.04] the farm raised eggs the backyard raised
[691.64 - 696.92] eggs we'll cover that a little bit too a
[694.04 - 699.68] virus does not have a
[696.92 - 702.76] mouth it's not an
[699.68 - 704.16] animal it's not like a human eating so
[702.76 - 707.32] even though this little virus right here
[704.16 - 709.52] has a mouth for fun viruses do not have
[707.32 - 712.68] mouths they absorb the food through
[709.52 - 715.16] their membrane that's what they do so
[712.68 - 718.00] when Foods available it's inside your
[715.16 - 719.56] liver it's inside your bloodstream it's
[718.00 - 722.48] inside your organs
[719.56 - 726.64] any viruses inside your body inside your
[722.48 - 727.64] liver bloodstream your organs will find
[726.64 - 730.72] that
[727.64 - 733.40] food so we eat the food we eat the egg
[730.72 - 734.60] the egg goes down inside of us it's in
[733.40 - 738.00] our
[734.60 - 739.92] stomach it's there starts to break apart
[738.00 - 743.56] our hydrochloric acid starts to break
[739.92 - 747.52] apart the protein and eggs
[743.56 - 751.40] protein and with that the egg starts to
[747.52 - 751.40] break apart and go through the
[753.76 - 757.84] body just want to let everybody know if
[755.92 - 760.24] you just got here we're making Millet
[757.84 - 762.72] Sushi hang out it's going to be fun
[760.24 - 766.44] we're talking about why eggs are bad for
[762.72 - 769.96] you and truly I hope you don't get too
[766.44 - 772.40] upset and too bummed out if you want to
[769.96 - 777.04] eat eggs you can eat all the eggs you
[772.40 - 780.12] want that's perfectly fine with me I'm
[777.04 - 781.80] just saying hey I want to talk about why
[780.12 - 785.60] maybe it's not a great
[781.80 - 787.16] idea and show you in a presentation why
[785.60 - 789.36] they're not good for you this is going
[787.16 - 792.24] to be fun I know that this is a heated
[789.36 - 794.80] topic people get charged they get jacked
[792.24 - 797.40] up people get the pitchforks out the
[794.80 - 799.88] Torches the shovels they want to beat my
[797.40 - 803.16] head in man they want to just take me
[799.88 - 805.24] out they do not like going like they
[803.16 - 809.12] don't even like hearing
[805.24 - 813.60] egg if it's going to be something bad
[809.12 - 816.56] you eat the egg you chew the egg you
[813.60 - 818.04] swallow the egg the egg gets down into
[816.56 - 820.68] the
[818.04 - 822.76] stomach what's left of your hydrochloric
[820.68 - 825.72] acid because most people have low
[822.76 - 827.96] HCL what's left of the HCL starts to
[825.72 - 829.24] work on it and breaks down the proteins
[827.96 - 835.24] of the
[829.24 - 840.76] egg the fat from the egg by passes the
[835.24 - 840.76] stomach and ends up in the dadna
[842.48 - 849.68] your liver has to produce
[845.68 - 852.84] bile and the bile has to come up and
[849.68 - 857.44] into the intestinal tract to break down
[852.84 - 859.88] the fats from the egg a normal
[857.44 - 863.72] digestive
[859.88 - 865.08] process but as this is happening signals
[863.72 - 868.80] are
[865.08 - 870.84] occurring and if you have bugs in you
[868.80 - 873.56] which most likely you do do you have
[870.84 - 876.28] chronic fatigue syndrome did you have
[873.56 - 878.32] fatigue do you have brain fog do you
[876.28 - 881.44] have tingles and numbness aches and
[878.32 - 883.76] pains do you have ra
[881.44 - 885.28] fibromyalgia did you have Lyme disease
[883.76 - 886.96] were you somebody that was diagnosed
[885.28 - 889.32] with Lyme disease years
[886.96 - 890.68] ago what kind of symptom condition do
[889.32 - 893.88] you have do you have
[890.68 - 895.76] UTI do you get lung infections kidney
[893.88 - 897.68] infections badder
[895.76 - 899.88] infections
[897.68 - 904.20] conjunctivitis
[899.88 - 906.00] sty what do you have that's going on
[904.20 - 907.80] what kind of symptom condition do you
[906.00 - 909.80] have eczema do you have
[907.80 - 912.12] psoriasis do you have
[909.80 - 915.04] Vitiligo what else is happening inside
[912.12 - 916.16] the body because people have symptoms
[915.04 - 919.16] and
[916.16 - 921.64] conditions much of which is caused by
[919.16 - 925.28] pathogens which are
[921.64 - 930.60] bugs and those bugs start seeking and
[925.28 - 930.60] searching for particles of eggs
[931.08 - 937.00] for instance strep a bacteria everybody
[934.00 - 939.24] has many people have multiple varieties
[937.00 - 941.56] of strep inside their intestinal
[939.24 - 943.40] tract many people have multiple
[941.56 - 944.76] varieties of strep inside their
[943.40 - 947.92] lymphatic
[944.76 - 950.88] vessels they have them in their ears and
[947.92 - 955.20] around the inside of their ears they
[950.88 - 959.60] have strep varieties on their
[955.20 - 962.12] anus many people have strep sitting
[959.60 - 965.08] on their
[962.12 - 968.08] anus and when they go to the bathroom
[965.08 - 969.24] strep pops off their anus and ends up in
[968.08 - 972.68] the
[969.24 - 974.16] toilet and sits there why more strep is
[972.68 - 977.68] produced inside their
[974.16 - 980.40] colon people are loaded with strep they
[977.68 - 982.12] get the diverticulosis
[980.40 - 984.16] diverticulitis they get different
[982.12 - 985.16] problems in their intestinal tract they
[984.16 - 989.48] get
[985.16 - 992.92] IBS whatever kind of bugs you have those
[989.48 - 996.20] bugs enjoy an
[992.92 - 999.60] egg they enjoy
[996.20 - 1002.12] eggs something important to
[999.60 - 1005.60] know now we have these comforting
[1002.12 - 1008.44] feelings around eggs I understand
[1005.60 - 1012.16] completely we find them the ultimate
[1008.44 - 1014.96] comfort food indeed we do we find them
[1012.16 - 1017.88] the ultimate comfort
[1014.96 - 1019.08] food so it's really hard to let go of
[1017.88 - 1021.24] our eggs
[1019.08 - 1024.60] because hey maybe your grandpa when you
[1021.24 - 1027.12] were a kid made you eggs it was really
[1024.60 - 1031.68] healing and really soothing maybe your
[1027.12 - 1033.80] mom packed you up an egg salad sandwich
[1031.68 - 1037.88] when you went to school elementary
[1033.80 - 1040.36] school maybe Sunday brunches with family
[1037.88 - 1042.68] there were different kinds of eggs
[1040.36 - 1046.44] scrambled poach
[1042.68 - 1049.40] omelets maybe have a loved one that made
[1046.44 - 1051.24] you eggs every day of your life
[1049.40 - 1054.00] maybe you remember as a kid just walk
[1051.24 - 1056.84] into the chicken shed the coupe the
[1054.00 - 1059.88] chicken Coupe and you harvested fresh
[1056.84 - 1063.56] eggs yourself and it was just it's
[1059.88 - 1065.96] ingrained in you and it's a beautiful
[1063.56 - 1068.28] experience and you harvested your own
[1065.96 - 1070.52] eggs for years and your family had them
[1068.28 - 1073.20] I don't doubt any of that isn't good and
[1070.52 - 1074.44] I don't doubt that any of that isn't
[1073.20 - 1076.64] special or
[1074.44 - 1079.44] beautiful that's not the problem the
[1076.64 - 1081.08] world has changed
[1079.44 - 1082.32] which leads to this next thing I want to
[1081.08 - 1085.40] talk
[1082.32 - 1088.32] about eggs would be fine and dandy they
[1085.40 - 1091.68] would be fine and
[1088.32 - 1093.48] dandy if what happened by the medical
[1091.68 - 1095.96] industry didn't
[1093.48 - 1097.60] happen don't blame me for being the
[1095.96 - 1099.92] messenger and bringing you the
[1097.60 - 1104.28] information about eggs about why they
[1099.92 - 1107.84] are bad for you blame the industries the
[1104.28 - 1109.76] medical industry yes that's why eggs are
[1107.84 - 1112.44] bad for you
[1109.76 - 1115.08] and I know that you're thinking hey look
[1112.44 - 1118.04] okay I'm listening I'm
[1115.08 - 1121.00] listening but it's not enough I want to
[1118.04 - 1123.40] know how it works why people get sick
[1121.00 - 1125.52] how come they can eat an egg and we'll
[1123.40 - 1127.16] go into that as well so but let's hit
[1125.52 - 1128.88] the medical industry first of all
[1127.16 - 1130.80] classified medical industry let's start
[1128.88 - 1134.44] with that for a little
[1130.80 - 1137.16] bit back over 100 years ago they were
[1134.44 - 1139.72] playing with their food they were trying
[1137.16 - 1143.20] to feed virus uses and pathogens and
[1139.72 - 1146.00] keep them alive in the
[1143.20 - 1149.36] labs and what they found classified
[1146.00 - 1153.84] medical research in science was that if
[1149.36 - 1153.84] they cut open the top of the
[1154.60 - 1159.28] egg and they
[1157.00 - 1162.28] Place
[1159.28 - 1162.28] pathogens
[1162.36 - 1170.56] bacteria
[1164.84 - 1173.64] viruses inside the egg they would would
[1170.56 - 1176.20] duplicate they would Mass
[1173.64 - 1179.12] produce inside the
[1176.20 - 1181.00] egg now when they took those viruses and
[1179.12 - 1185.84] those pathogens and that
[1181.00 - 1185.84] bacteria and they put it
[1187.32 - 1195.20] beside some bacon
[1191.12 - 1198.56] pork it didn't Mass produce like
[1195.20 - 1202.52] that so over a hundred years ago they
[1198.56 - 1205.08] took bacteria and viruses in the lab and
[1202.52 - 1209.60] they put it beside pork they put it
[1205.08 - 1213.00] beside meat beef they put it beside
[1209.60 - 1217.64] different vegetables and they
[1213.00 - 1221.96] noticed that none of the pathogens would
[1217.64 - 1224.32] Thrive they wouldn't explode they
[1221.96 - 1227.64] wouldn't duplicate
[1224.32 - 1229.84] multiply but what they did notice is
[1227.64 - 1233.00] when they took took the
[1229.84 - 1235.28] egg and just the outside of the egg and
[1233.00 - 1237.36] they put pathogens on the outside of the
[1235.28 - 1239.08] eggshell they noticed the pathogens
[1237.36 - 1240.88] would stay
[1239.08 - 1243.00] alive
[1240.88 - 1245.20] interesting and then when they cut the
[1243.00 - 1247.12] egg open and they cut the top of the egg
[1245.20 - 1249.48] open and they had it in their little
[1247.12 - 1249.48] dish
[1252.04 - 1257.48] thing they notice when they cut the tops
[1254.60 - 1259.84] of the eggs and they put pathogens
[1257.48 - 1261.80] within it back bacteria they already
[1259.84 - 1263.16] identified they noticed that an
[1261.80 - 1266.80] explosion
[1263.16 - 1269.84] occurred for some
[1266.80 - 1271.80] reason pathogens viruses
[1269.84 - 1273.84] bacteria
[1271.80 - 1275.40] mold
[1273.84 - 1277.76] yeast
[1275.40 - 1282.56] fungus grew
[1277.76 - 1282.56] rapidly and exploded inside those
[1282.88 - 1289.20] eggs and they knew they can use the eggs
[1285.40 - 1293.24] as a tool now this is over 100 years
[1289.20 - 1295.48] ago keep that in mind this is over a 100
[1293.24 - 1295.48] years
[1296.44 - 1301.56] ago but classified medical research and
[1299.08 - 1304.44] science learned that they can manipulate
[1301.56 - 1309.56] bugs sound
[1304.44 - 1312.96] familiar sound familiar doesn't
[1309.56 - 1316.04] it because bugs have been raised in labs
[1312.96 - 1318.20] for well over a 100 years and that very
[1316.04 - 1320.92] bug on your lip when you get the simp
[1318.20 - 1325.64] Lex one was raised in a lab
[1320.92 - 1327.96] originally and it was fed
[1325.64 - 1330.36] eggs so that cold sore that you
[1327.96 - 1332.28] developed a long time ago in your life
[1330.36 - 1333.84] or just developed yesterday because you
[1332.28 - 1335.88] picked up the cold sore the fever
[1333.84 - 1341.60] blister from somebody else the simplex
[1335.88 - 1346.72] one that bug is an old bug been around a
[1341.60 - 1350.60] long time was raised in Labs off of
[1346.72 - 1351.88] eggs very important to know let's take
[1350.60 - 1356.12] it a little
[1351.88 - 1358.36] further every single bug was raised on
[1356.12 - 1361.04] eggs at one point early varieties of
[1358.36 - 1364.00] Epstein bar virus were raised on eggs in
[1361.04 - 1367.28] Labs Epstein bar anybody fibromyalgia
[1364.00 - 1368.88] thyroid thyroiditis
[1367.28 - 1373.24] Hashimoto
[1368.88 - 1376.96] hypothyroidism ra psoriatic
[1373.24 - 1380.56] arthritis lime disease yeah lime
[1376.96 - 1385.52] disease ring a bell anybody the Epstein
[1380.56 - 1389.52] bar virus long C long
[1385.52 - 1392.60] Co the epin bar virus was raised early
[1389.52 - 1396.88] on by medical research and Science in
[1392.60 - 1398.88] Labs knowing knowing that the eggs was
[1396.88 - 1401.20] an amazing fuel source for those
[1398.88 - 1405.44] pathogens and those pathogens fed and
[1401.20 - 1408.56] fed and fed on that egg material why now
[1405.44 - 1412.32] let's go to that point real quick how
[1408.56 - 1416.48] come viruses and bacteria and pathogens
[1412.32 - 1419.72] thrive on egg how is it possible because
[1416.48 - 1423.36] it's an underdeveloped
[1419.72 - 1425.16] protein the egg has an
[1423.36 - 1428.48] underdeveloped
[1425.16 - 1431.92] protein a protein that's not fully
[1428.48 - 1433.56] developed it's easy to conquer easy to
[1431.92 - 1437.24] feed off
[1433.56 - 1439.32] of pathogens and viruses devoured the
[1437.24 - 1440.24] underdeveloped velop protein inside of
[1439.32 - 1444.40] raw
[1440.24 - 1445.68] eggs the baby chick never had a chance
[1444.40 - 1448.32] never had a
[1445.68 - 1451.28] chance for
[1448.32 - 1453.04] survival not that it would have survived
[1451.28 - 1454.48] the eggs were already cracked open and
[1453.04 - 1456.80] used in the lab
[1454.48 - 1458.68] anyway the chicken would have never made
[1456.80 - 1461.32] it no matter
[1458.68 - 1464.28] what but the underdeveloped proteins
[1461.32 - 1467.28] that that baby chick had was a fuel
[1464.28 - 1468.72] source for viruses to easily conquer and
[1467.28 - 1471.32] invade
[1468.72 - 1473.20] it was a quick fuel source whether
[1471.32 - 1477.20] anybody likes it or
[1473.20 - 1480.96] not what whether anybody likes it or not
[1477.20 - 1484.48] I don't believe him that can't be true
[1480.96 - 1487.12] he's evil what does he know he's not a
[1484.48 - 1490.40] doctor I eat eggs every day and feed
[1487.12 - 1493.32] them to my kids eggs are good staple for
[1490.40 - 1496.48] me I got strong fingernails and I got
[1493.32 - 1500.04] good skin my grandmother ate eggs for
[1496.48 - 1502.48] 150 years she never had a single problem
[1500.04 - 1506.08] I get it everybody's going to be
[1502.48 - 1509.48] freaking the Freak Out totally and they
[1506.08 - 1512.48] do and they do I'm an athlete and I eat
[1509.48 - 1516.20] eight eggs a day this is
[1512.48 - 1518.08] BS go listen to blah blah blah this link
[1516.20 - 1522.00] right here this guy will tell you how
[1518.08 - 1525.84] good eggs are heard it all seen it all
[1522.00 - 1529.16] it doesn't change one powerful fact the
[1525.84 - 1530.60] industry used eggs to create more
[1529.16 - 1535.04] viruses and
[1530.60 - 1537.88] pathogens those were released in our
[1535.04 - 1540.20] environment through certain
[1537.88 - 1543.16] means and
[1540.20 - 1545.52] exposures and those viruses have thrived
[1543.16 - 1549.80] and that's why nursing homes have 30
[1545.52 - 1553.44] year olds in them and that's why nursing
[1549.80 - 1557.08] homes are loaded with 30y
[1553.44 - 1559.56] olds uh-huh who can't use their arms and
[1557.08 - 1563.52] legs any anymore who are literally
[1559.56 - 1567.48] trapped in bed neurologically sick being
[1563.52 - 1569.76] spoonfed IVs food being drawn up through
[1567.48 - 1573.20] their stomach through a j
[1569.76 - 1575.12] tube because of pathogens from
[1573.20 - 1577.12] classified medical research and science
[1575.12 - 1580.52] going all the way back over a hundred
[1577.12 - 1583.04] years ago but eggs make me feel good but
[1580.52 - 1585.24] eggs go really easy in my stomach he's
[1583.04 - 1586.60] full of it eggs are great for you eggs
[1585.24 - 1589.60] are high in
[1586.60 - 1589.60] protein
[1591.76 - 1596.52] but the viruses and the pathogens the
[1594.28 - 1599.80] bacteria that are here and the super
[1596.52 - 1604.64] fungus the super
[1599.80 - 1609.32] fungus and the crazy bugs Mera and
[1604.64 - 1611.52] crap they love eggs they love
[1609.32 - 1614.00] eggs you're sitting in the hospital
[1611.52 - 1617.72] you're battling a Mera infection from
[1614.00 - 1619.08] hell and yeah can I have two eggs over
[1617.72 - 1623.40] easy
[1619.08 - 1625.76] please um can I ring the buzzer nurse
[1623.40 - 1628.36] yeah nurse can can I have two eggs can I
[1625.76 - 1631.44] have two scrambled eggs please can I
[1628.36 - 1635.60] have two fried eggs is that okay coming
[1631.44 - 1637.68] right up merca patient well make
[1635.60 - 1640.00] sure it's not the people in the
[1637.68 - 1644.20] hospital's fault it's nothing like that
[1640.00 - 1648.28] it's just a hardcore truth whether
[1644.20 - 1650.32] anybody likes it or not
[1648.28 - 1653.04] and guess what my feelings don't get
[1650.32 - 1655.84] hurt when people talk crap about the
[1653.04 - 1657.36] medical medium egg information that's
[1655.84 - 1659.76] out
[1657.36 - 1661.76] there I just always have this gleam of
[1659.76 - 1663.16] hope that somebody who's really sick and
[1661.76 - 1664.64] suffering and struggling who's eating
[1663.16 - 1666.92] eggs in that moment might be able to
[1664.64 - 1669.20] switch gears not eat eggs and get a
[1666.92 - 1671.00] fighting chance so at least the
[1669.20 - 1673.84] pathogens are keep that are keeping them
[1671.00 - 1676.52] bedridden are not feeding on something
[1673.84 - 1679.52] that in the end will keep them bogged
[1676.52 - 1679.52] down
[1680.12 - 1685.24] lot to talk about we're still going man
[1682.56 - 1687.08] wild blueberry dreams on IG says a w my
[1685.24 - 1689.88] functional medicine doctor had me
[1687.08 - 1692.04] reintroduce eggs back into my diet and
[1689.88 - 1694.56] soon after ended up in the hospital
[1692.04 - 1696.96] diagnosed with multiple sorosis multiple
[1694.56 - 1701.64] sclerosis I wrote in the medical medium
[1696.96 - 1704.52] books from above Ms caused by Epstein
[1701.64 - 1707.16] bar virus and lo and
[1704.52 - 1709.08] behold Harvard took that information
[1707.16 - 1711.04] from the books because guess what it was
[1709.08 - 1713.92] published here first that Epstein bar is
[1711.04 - 1713.92] the cause of multiple
[1714.96 - 1720.20] sclerosis Queenie says over there in IG
[1717.72 - 1723.76] funny how Fitness influencers I follow
[1720.20 - 1725.12] that are in a strict diet with eggs Etc
[1723.76 - 1728.20] are ending up in the hospital with
[1725.12 - 1730.72] stomach problems funnier than that which
[1728.20 - 1733.36] is not so funny can't tell you how many

[1810.76 - 1816.64] my ingredients here I'm pumped it's
[1812.92 - 1818.76] minus the Mercury minus the Mercury man
[1816.64 - 1820.44] which is the tuna fish right Erica over
[1818.76 - 1823.04] there on YouTube says oh my God I have
[1820.44 - 1826.24] cold Source all the
[1823.04 - 1830.48] time cold sores all the
[1826.24 - 1835.68] time Jolene says no such thing a
[1830.48 - 1839.00] viruses it's terrain Theory clean up the
[1835.68 - 1840.16] environment okay so if I'm laying in bed
[1839.00 - 1843.96] and I'm
[1840.16 - 1846.72] bedridden and I'm stuck in bed sick as a
[1843.96 - 1848.60] goat I can't even use my arms and I got
[1846.72 - 1850.80] tingles and numbness I got all kinds of
[1848.60 - 1854.52] problems I got body pain that's killing
[1850.80 - 1858.20] me my jaw is on fire my tongue
[1854.52 - 1860.04] Burns I've been to 30 doctors I've tried
[1858.20 - 1863.36] every drug
[1860.04 - 1866.84] practically okay I'm going to take that
[1863.36 - 1870.64] advice viruses don't exist that person's
[1866.84 - 1873.28] right terrain Theory screw that Anthony
[1870.64 - 1873.28] what does he
[1874.16 - 1880.24] know instead it's like I'm sick I need
[1878.32 - 1884.36] to get better what was that about the
[1880.24 - 1886.16] eggs I need to know all right let's go a
[1884.36 - 1889.16] little
[1886.16 - 1889.16] deeper
[1894.76 - 1897.00] here we
[1898.92 - 1906.28] are got this little hardboiled egg right
[1902.32 - 1908.92] here okay I don't care if it's over easy
[1906.28 - 1911.40] fried poached I don't care if it's an
[1908.92 - 1913.80] omelette I don't care if it's eggs
[1911.40 - 1917.76] benedict I don't care if it's just in
[1913.80 - 1919.76] your Mayo which is kind of funny because
[1917.76 - 1922.44] how come we're told not to leave the
[1919.76 - 1923.52] mayonnaise out in the sun because you
[1922.44 - 1926.92] can
[1923.52 - 1926.92] die how about
[1929.00 - 1933.76] that how
[1931.28 - 1939.48] about why would we
[1933.76 - 1941.72] die if you leave that tuna salad
[1939.48 - 1943.72] sandwich that tuna fish sandwich that
[1941.72 - 1946.28] has mayo
[1943.72 - 1947.68] outside too long you got to keep it
[1946.28 - 1950.44] refrigerated
[1947.68 - 1953.48] or you can
[1950.44 - 1955.92] die are we allowed to leave egg salad in
[1953.48 - 1958.80] the Sun how come we can't leave egg
[1955.92 - 1961.08] salad in the sun all day because chances
[1958.80 - 1963.36] are someone's going to say dear lord
[1961.08 - 1965.72] lord throw that egg salad out you're
[1963.36 - 1965.72] going to
[1966.84 - 1972.88] die yeah interesting because I'm still
[1970.48 - 1975.44] trying I'm like scratching my head and
[1972.88 - 1978.60] I'm thinking how come how come if you
[1975.44 - 1980.76] leave some cucumber salad in the outside
[1978.60 - 1982.32] on the table and in the sun you're not
[1980.76 - 1984.64] going to
[1982.32 - 1987.24] die how about if you leave something
[1984.64 - 1989.56] else out there too whatever some fruit
[1987.24 - 1993.00] you're not going to die how
[1989.56 - 1996.36] come you can even you can even leave a
[1993.00 - 1999.44] steak sandwich out there you can leave a
[1996.36 - 2003.20] freaking steak sandwich out there on the
[1999.44 - 2004.88] table at a picnic for hours come to it
[2003.20 - 2008.80] and be like whoo this is a good steak
[2004.88 - 2010.96] sandwich I'm just going to eat this now
[2008.80 - 2013.20] but the minute you leave an egg salad
[2010.96 - 2015.00] out there on the table and you went out
[2013.20 - 2017.28] there playing frisbee for a couple of
[2015.00 - 2020.20] hours and that egg salad sitting on the
[2017.28 - 2023.40] table someone's going to say oh my God
[2020.20 - 2026.72] don't eat that smack it out of your hand
[2023.40 - 2028.28] slam you in the face while you spit out
[2026.72 - 2029.52] that egg salad and they're going to say
[2028.28 - 2031.28] what do you want to
[2029.52 - 2033.68] die how
[2031.28 - 2038.24] come because
[2033.68 - 2040.80] eggs can explode with bacteria and
[2038.24 - 2043.00] pathogens that's why because too many
[2040.80 - 2046.08] people have gotten sick from eggs
[2043.00 - 2050.52] sitting out too long or at a picnic or a
[2046.08 - 2050.52] mayonnaise they've gotten sick food
[2050.88 - 2055.84] poisoning W how is that possible is it
[2054.08 - 2058.08] okay what about an orange sitting out on
[2055.84 - 2059.88] the table half the day are you going to
[2058.08 - 2061.36] die if your orange is sitting on the
[2059.88 - 2063.28] picnic table for half the day are you
[2061.36 - 2067.80] going to die then you can go up there
[2063.28 - 2070.04] and eat that orange right but how is it
[2067.80 - 2071.60] possible you leave that egg salad out
[2070.04 - 2073.12] there too long or how about this potato
[2071.60 - 2074.28] salad with the mayonnaise you leave that
[2073.12 - 2077.80] out there too
[2074.28 - 2081.16] long you're playing Russian roulette
[2077.80 - 2083.00] man crazy next thing you know you're
[2081.16 - 2085.00] barfing your brains out you're [ __ ]
[2083.00 - 2088.68] your brains out you're in the hospital
[2085.00 - 2090.92] you're on IVs you're totally your system
[2088.68 - 2092.84] is crashed your your immune systems
[2090.92 - 2097.52] crashed your adrenals are crashed
[2092.84 - 2102.16] because that Mayo that egg can PL riate
[2097.52 - 2105.16] man it can explode in bugs because bugs
[2102.16 - 2107.64] feed off of eggs I'm sorry to tell you
[2105.16 - 2112.04] but it's more than that bugs inside of
[2107.64 - 2112.04] our body feed on the eggs we
[2112.16 - 2115.72] eat important to
[2117.64 - 2121.40] know I'm going to check my
[2124.88 - 2129.32] Millet want to give him a little Quick
[2131.40 - 2134.40] Check
[2138.20 - 2144.08] nice want to make sure it's good I think
[2141.88 - 2144.08] it
[2146.36 - 2149.68] is let's
[2151.20 - 2157.60] go excuse me I hope you're okay with
[2155.80 - 2160.48] this hold
[2157.60 - 2164.16] on don't want to burn my mouth it's done
[2160.48 - 2169.32] it's cooked I just would like to taste
[2164.16 - 2169.32] it m so good
[2169.44 - 2176.56] perfect
[2172.08 - 2176.56] wow all right c a little bit
[2184.88 - 2189.60] more yep guys we're going to make Millet
[2188.16 - 2193.24] sushi in a couple minutes just want to
[2189.60 - 2193.24] give you a little bit more insight on
[2193.44 - 2198.60] eggs you eat the egg the egg ends up in
[2196.24 - 2201.24] the stomach if you're somebody with acid
[2198.60 - 2203.12] reflux and you got bacteria creating
[2201.24 - 2205.60] that acid reflux if you're somebody with
[2203.12 - 2207.60] ulcers and you got bacteria creating
[2205.60 - 2209.04] those ulcers guess what the bacteria is
[2207.60 - 2214.08] going to feed off of it's going to feed
[2209.04 - 2214.08] off of egg particles underdeveloped
[2214.64 - 2218.44] proteins the minute that egg drops drops
[2216.88 - 2221.20] down into your intestinal tra and you're
[2218.44 - 2223.96] dealing with crohn's colitis
[2221.20 - 2226.76] IBS any kind of inflammation in your
[2223.96 - 2229.68] intestinal tract corners of your colon
[2226.76 - 2232.76] corners of your small intestinal tract
[2229.68 - 2235.56] ilium anything you got in there bacteria
[2232.76 - 2239.16] strep staff
[2235.56 - 2240.64] SEI it's going to have a bonanza it's
[2239.16 - 2242.80] going to be eating off the
[2240.64 - 2245.60] underdeveloped egg proteins it's going
[2242.80 - 2248.60] to feed off of it I hate to bring this
[2245.60 - 2248.60] news
[2248.88 - 2253.52] once that egg gets down and it's now
[2250.68 - 2256.16] down there to the alium it comes back up
[2253.52 - 2259.36] it's it's asending then it's going
[2256.16 - 2261.24] across then it's descending and we got a
[2259.36 - 2264.04] whole bunch of different kinds of strep
[2261.24 - 2266.36] and other things in this bacteria yeast
[2264.04 - 2269.36] bad yeast fungus that's not the good
[2266.36 - 2271.72] fungus all of it mold whatever we got in
[2269.36 - 2273.24] US guess what it's going to thrive and
[2271.72 - 2275.28] it's going to be happy and it's going to
[2273.24 - 2277.40] feed off those particles but more than
[2275.28 - 2280.52] that when that that egg is sitting
[2277.40 - 2280.52] inside the intestinal
[2280.72 - 2287.48] tract it's going to start going through
[2284.76 - 2290.08] the intestinal tract lining as it's
[2287.48 - 2291.84] being broken down and digested and
[2290.08 - 2296.24] particles of that egg is going to ride
[2291.84 - 2298.64] up into the liver up the hepatic portal
[2296.24 - 2301.28] Highway when it gets to the
[2298.64 - 2303.16] liver people have a lot of sick livers
[2301.28 - 2305.52] they're loaded with things that create
[2303.16 - 2307.24] things like hepatitis C which is Epstein
[2305.52 - 2308.76] bar
[2307.24 - 2310.84] they have all kinds of pathogens and
[2308.76 - 2313.28] bugs inside their
[2310.84 - 2316.00] liver it's going to feed off of the egg
[2313.28 - 2318.40] inside the liver people walking around
[2316.00 - 2322.32] with sick livers I couldn't believe it I
[2318.40 - 2323.32] saw an ad the other day an ad out there
[2322.32 - 2326.00] on
[2323.32 - 2328.88] social of some [ __ ]
[2326.00 - 2332.72] drinking and I say this with
[2328.88 - 2336.20] respect some [ __ ] doctor or somebody
[2332.72 - 2339.00] out of respect was drinking a whole big
[2336.20 - 2341.96] thing of olive oil telling people this
[2339.00 - 2341.96] is really good for
[2346.88 - 2351.96] you a ni nice way to kill your liver
[2350.12 - 2353.64] just kill your liver drink let's just
[2351.96 - 2355.24] drink a whole thing of olive oil why am
[2353.64 - 2357.48] I saying this
[2355.24 - 2359.76] because those same practitioners and
[2357.48 - 2362.80] doctors believe in eggs they believe in
[2359.76 - 2363.96] them like nobody's business they believe
[2362.80 - 2365.68] eggs are good they're filled with
[2363.96 - 2368.48] nutrients I get it there's nutrients in
[2365.68 - 2370.08] eggs there's some minerals and eggs of
[2368.48 - 2371.32] course because the baby chick needed
[2370.08 - 2374.24] those
[2371.32 - 2377.16] minerals there's protein and eggs under
[2374.24 - 2378.96] under develop proteins but they're there
[2377.16 - 2381.12] there's amino acids and eggs of course
[2378.96 - 2383.76] the baby chicken needed those amino
[2381.12 - 2386.28] acids there's a lot of different
[2383.76 - 2388.64] nutrients inside the eggs too to provide
[2386.28 - 2390.76] that baby chick steam to actually
[2388.64 - 2393.00] develop and
[2390.76 - 2395.60] grow and I think a lot of people are
[2393.00 - 2399.44] hanging their hat on that my eggs have
[2395.60 - 2403.44] you know a mega 3es in them our eggs at
[2399.44 - 2407.64] our farm have lots of Omega-3s in them
[2403.44 - 2411.24] our farm fresh eggs are loaded with
[2407.64 - 2411.24] Omega-3s and many
[2412.00 - 2417.64] nutrients that doesn't determine what's
[2415.16 - 2419.08] going to happen with bugs inside of us
[2417.64 - 2420.04] that are keeping us sick it's not going
[2419.08 - 2422.88] to
[2420.04 - 2424.88] determine what bugs in us do just
[2422.88 - 2426.96] because there is a little bit of Omega-3
[2424.88 - 2428.60] in somebody's farm fresh eggs doesn't
[2426.96 - 2430.36] mean that's going to protect you for
[2428.60 - 2433.32] when the pathogens viruses yeast and
[2430.36 - 2436.64] mold have a Feeding Frenzy on particles
[2433.32 - 2438.64] of egg that it wants there ain't no
[2436.64 - 2440.08] omega-3 that's going to stop that and
[2438.64 - 2441.44] there ain't no mineral and there ain't
[2440.08 - 2444.04] no Trace mineral and there ain't no
[2441.44 - 2445.56] nutrient or amino acid throwing nothing
[2444.04 - 2447.48] like that inside that egg that's going
[2445.56 - 2448.76] to stop that pathogen from eating and
[2447.48 - 2451.36] eating and here's the other thing you
[2448.76 - 2453.52] can be healthy seemingly healthy and you
[2451.36 - 2455.96] can have eggs every single day you can
[2453.52 - 2458.20] be eating them and lo and behold you
[2455.96 - 2459.96] finally get sick because guess what one
[2458.20 - 2461.96] egg too much pushed you over the edge
[2459.96 - 2463.68] your immune system was low Death By A
[2461.96 - 2465.88] Thousand Cuts you already had other
[2463.68 - 2467.96] exposures and problems maybe you picked
[2465.88 - 2470.68] up a new bug in a relationship or
[2467.96 - 2472.88] something and finally that omelette
[2470.68 - 2475.40] you're eating or that poached egg or
[2472.88 - 2477.64] that fried egg or over easy or sunny
[2475.40 - 2480.32] side up got to you finally because it
[2477.64 - 2482.64] fed the pathogens and maybe that
[2480.32 - 2485.00] UTI that you got that you had to take
[2482.64 - 2486.88] antibiotics for wouldn't have happened
[2485.00 - 2488.60] if eggs weren't in your system all these
[2486.88 - 2490.40] years and you weren't eating eggs on a
[2488.60 - 2492.96] regular basis you would have been
[2490.40 - 2496.08] protected from that UTI because those
[2492.96 - 2498.28] eggs just push things over the edge just
[2496.08 - 2503.44] enough for pathogens and bacteria to
[2498.28 - 2507.52] feed on those eggs and then double in in
[2503.44 - 2510.48] amounts per ounce of
[2507.52 - 2513.36] blood when we eat the egg goes into our
[2510.48 - 2516.04] liver it goes up the hepatic portal vein
[2513.36 - 2517.48] it goes into our bloodstream and if
[2516.04 - 2519.24] you're you're dealing with infections
[2517.48 - 2521.24] all through your body like trigeminal
[2519.24 - 2522.76] neuralgia because you got simplex one or
[2521.24 - 2524.60] the shingles you dealing with the
[2522.76 - 2527.16] shingles and the shingles is giving you
[2524.60 - 2530.24] all this jaw pain all this ear pain and
[2527.16 - 2532.08] facial pain and your nerves are inflamed
[2530.24 - 2533.56] your vagus nerves are inflamed all
[2532.08 - 2535.80] through your body and you're
[2533.56 - 2538.28] struggling and you're panicking and you
[2535.80 - 2540.76] got problems with your nervous system
[2538.28 - 2543.08] eggs will help and feed the problem they
[2540.76 - 2544.80] won't help fix the problem they help
[2543.08 - 2546.76] worsen the problem now I don't tell
[2544.80 - 2548.44] people never eat an egg if you don't
[2546.76 - 2550.32] want an egg I tell them if you're sick
[2548.44 - 2553.04] and you're struggling it would be a good
[2550.32 - 2555.60] idea if you refrain from eggs and keep
[2553.04 - 2556.84] them back and not have them in your life
[2555.60 - 2559.96] because they're
[2556.84 - 2561.20] trouble because they feed the bugs all
[2559.96 - 2563.68] right you guys I'm going to make some
[2561.20 - 2563.68] Millet
[2565.24 - 2569.28] Sushi let's roll let's have some
[2569.36 - 2575.28] fun and on a note okay I know the
[2572.44 - 2578.04] emotional attachment to eggs I know the
[2575.28 - 2579.60] Comfort the comfort food I know that
[2578.04 - 2581.68] some people say it's the one thing that
[2579.60 - 2584.64] doesn't bother my stomach because if I
[2581.68 - 2586.80] eat a raw vegetable my intestinal track
[2584.64 - 2588.64] if I eat a lettuce my intestinal tra
[2586.80 - 2589.80] hurts and doesn't feel good I know
[2588.64 - 2591.60] there's a whole bunch of people and they
[2589.80 - 2593.16] say when they eat an egg it feels good
[2591.60 - 2594.84] let me tell you why real quick before we
[2593.16 - 2599.36] get
[2594.84 - 2603.40] rolling when you have eggs they don't
[2599.36 - 2605.08] rub against your intestinal lining when
[2603.40 - 2608.80] you eat an
[2605.08 - 2610.92] egg they don't massage your intestinal
[2608.80 - 2612.00] lining this is so important to know
[2610.92 - 2613.72] probably one of the most important
[2612.00 - 2616.24] things to know because I know so many
[2613.72 - 2618.80] people are going to be like no eggs make
[2616.24 - 2621.48] my stomach feel
[2618.80 - 2624.12] good but what you have to
[2621.48 - 2628.24] know is that the eggs turn into a
[2624.12 - 2632.32] liquefied glue that doesn't massage or
[2628.24 - 2634.96] create peristaltic action it doesn't rub
[2632.32 - 2638.00] your Linings when you eat a piece of
[2634.96 - 2641.24] lettuce it must massages the Linings as
[2638.00 - 2644.40] it's going through you when you eat a
[2641.24 - 2645.36] little piece of red cabbage when you eat
[2644.40 - 2650.44] some
[2645.36 - 2653.32] Millet when you eat a piece of fruit an
[2650.44 - 2655.44] orange it's going to massage it's going
[2653.32 - 2657.20] to go through your intestinal tract and
[2655.44 - 2658.92] you might be one of those people where
[2657.20 - 2662.16] you've got hot spots inside your
[2658.92 - 2664.84] intestinal tract pockets of inflammation
[2662.16 - 2667.80] because of pathogens bacteria likee
[2664.84 - 2669.48] strep and different viruses and those
[2667.80 - 2671.56] Pockets that have the strep and the
[2669.48 - 2673.60] different viruses and yeast and mold and
[2671.56 - 2675.48] fungus that's not the good fungus when
[2673.60 - 2678.56] you have pockets of this you get
[2675.48 - 2680.64] inflammation in the pockets expansions
[2678.56 - 2683.68] and narrowings your small intestinal
[2680.64 - 2686.00] tract will expand in areas and it'll
[2683.68 - 2689.08] also narrow and tighten up and lose its
[2686.00 - 2691.92] elasticity in areas and
[2689.08 - 2693.64] then you eat something like a vegetable
[2691.92 - 2695.52] you eat a steamed vegetable you eat a
[2693.64 - 2697.08] raw vegetable you eat a piece of lettuce
[2695.52 - 2699.32] you eat it orange you eat a piece of
[2697.08 - 2701.40] fruit you eat a cucumber and you're like
[2699.32 - 2703.84] I'm not digesting this food good I can't
[2701.40 - 2706.36] eat salads I can't digest good but what
[2703.84 - 2708.68] you don't know is it's digesting it's
[2706.36 - 2711.12] just that you're feeling it rub and
[2708.68 - 2713.32] you're feeling it roll and when it rubs
[2711.12 - 2716.28] and rolls you got hot spots you're going
[2713.32 - 2719.16] to be like I better go back to eating
[2716.28 - 2722.48] eggs because those eggs felt good and
[2719.16 - 2726.52] the reason why they may feel good is
[2722.48 - 2730.20] because they become a glue they become a
[2726.52 - 2732.44] liquefied goop and that liquefied goop
[2730.20 - 2734.88] doesn't rub it doesn't touch the
[2732.44 - 2737.64] intestinal lining too much it goes
[2734.88 - 2739.92] through and it sits there like a goo and
[2737.64 - 2742.04] it's not creating peristaltic action
[2739.92 - 2744.80] it's not going into corners and cleaning
[2742.04 - 2747.64] them out instead it's feeding what's
[2744.80 - 2750.28] ever there to begin with that's giving
[2747.64 - 2752.08] you the sensations of I got problems
[2750.28 - 2755.44] with my intestinal tract and guts to
[2752.08 - 2758.36] begin with and that's why people find
[2755.44 - 2759.88] eggs soothing they find them easy on the
[2758.36 - 2761.64] system they find that they're not
[2759.88 - 2764.16] creating a problem in the moment they
[2761.64 - 2766.84] could eat the eggs they feel soft
[2764.16 - 2769.12] they're cuddly they feel like a warm
[2766.84 - 2770.92] comfortable blanket and that's how it
[2769.12 - 2774.96] feels inside of
[2770.92 - 2777.88] us and we get tricked and we think we're
[2774.96 - 2777.88] good and we're
[2778.00 - 2781.24] fine all
[2782.16 - 2788.00] right now I'm hoping to actually
[2785.12 - 2789.76] replicate this right here but if you've
[2788.00 - 2791.60] ever been to Medical medum lives and
[2789.76 - 2793.48] recipes and stuff like that occasionally
[2791.60 - 2795.12] it just goes a little different but I'm
[2793.48 - 2797.96] going to try to make it look like this
[2795.12 - 2797.96] I'm going to marinate the
[2798.24 - 2803.96] ginger in some squeezed orange juice let
[2801.72 - 2807.12] me get rid of
[2803.96 - 2807.12] these you
[2807.64 - 2811.36] know let me get rid of
[2812.68 - 2817.96] these just hold
[2814.60 - 2817.96] on hold hold
[2822.80 - 2829.32] on just hold out a bit this don't worry
[2826.68 - 2832.04] I'm closet eating the eggs you guys
[2829.32 - 2834.28] didn't see that right all right I'm
[2832.04 - 2834.28] going to
[2835.44 - 2840.08] marinate you know I wake in the morning
[2837.76 - 2841.48] and I'm like am I going to create a
[2840.08 - 2844.00] situation where someone's not going to
[2841.48 - 2845.12] be happy I'm going to slice the ginger
[2844.00 - 2846.60] and I'm going to get the orange juice
[2845.12 - 2848.92] going first of all let's get some orange
[2846.60 - 2848.92] juice
[2853.76 - 2857.76] going
[2855.28 - 2861.00] nice all right let's get a little juice
[2857.76 - 2865.00] from the orange squeezed in
[2861.00 - 2866.72] here no disrespect to egg lovers no
[2865.00 - 2868.44] disrespect to
[2866.72 - 2872.00] chickens you
[2868.44 - 2875.24] know no disrespect to animal protein
[2872.00 - 2877.16] eaters this isn't propaganda because the
[2875.24 - 2880.48] vegans don't know this information they
[2877.16 - 2883.32] never did this is not like a vegan
[2880.48 - 2886.28] Channel where it's all about vegan vegan
[2883.32 - 2888.32] you're evil if you eat meat you're evil
[2886.28 - 2891.68] if you eat an animal protein this isn't
[2888.32 - 2893.60] what this is this is for all this is for
[2891.68 - 2895.28] vegans plant-based people cuz they end
[2893.60 - 2896.44] up eating eggs anyway they go back to
[2895.28 - 2898.76] eating eggs the minute they get a
[2896.44 - 2901.60] symptom because they're eating you know
[2898.76 - 2903.64] a vegan diet they get exposed exposure
[2901.60 - 2905.92] problems expose to something they're not
[2903.64 - 2908.00] eating um their vegan diet right right
[2905.92 - 2910.32] for what they
[2908.00 - 2912.40] need and so they end up getting sick
[2910.32 - 2914.16] they get their first symptom and what
[2912.40 - 2916.24] happens lo and behold they're freaking
[2914.16 - 2918.32] out and they go back to eggs
[2916.24 - 2919.72] anyway how many people do that there's
[2918.32 - 2922.64] some people I think just in the medical
[2919.72 - 2924.76] medium community that are that are like
[2922.64 - 2927.44] telling people you need to eat meat
[2924.76 - 2930.36] every day and eggs and
[2927.44 - 2931.52] cheese because I'm telling you eating
[2930.36 - 2932.64] medical medium is going to hurt you
[2931.52 - 2934.68] meanwhile they weren't even eating
[2932.64 - 2939.28] medical medium they were eating just fat
[2934.68 - 2941.20] vegan overt fats just vegan food they
[2939.28 - 2942.76] were eating like cupcakes with canola
[2941.20 - 2944.80] oil throughout the years they were just
[2942.76 - 2946.48] eating whatever but it was vegan
[2944.80 - 2949.72] meanwhile they'll be like don't eat
[2946.48 - 2952.96] medical medium you should be on eggs and
[2949.72 - 2954.72] cheese and butter I give my kids eggs
[2952.96 - 2956.56] and cheese and butter and lots of it
[2954.72 - 2960.04] right now you you'll hear that once in a
[2956.56 - 2962.72] while and it's like dude i' love to i'
[2960.04 - 2964.16] love love to see what you were eaing all
[2962.72 - 2967.52] these
[2964.16 - 2967.52] years all right

[2971.48 - 2975.48] some
[2973.36 - 2978.08] oranges I'm just going to marinate some
[2975.48 - 2978.08] ginger in
[2978.44 - 2981.44] here
[2983.96 - 2989.84] great okay all
[2986.72 - 2992.64] right now I want to kind of slice them
[2989.84 - 2994.72] in slices just bear with me here and I'm
[2992.64 - 2995.92] going to take off the Skins you can keep

[3075.56 - 3080.48] to give you the
[3076.92 - 3083.64] four warning the
[3080.48 - 3086.40] messages that I can message to you about
[3083.64 - 3087.88] how it works with eggs
[3086.40 - 3089.76] and we're going to we're not even done I
[3087.88 - 3092.96] have to tell you why it even got to this
[3089.76 - 3096.72] degree eggs were a great survival food
[3092.96 - 3098.72] years ago before 100 years ago they were
[3096.72 - 3102.60] an important
[3098.72 - 3106.68] staple and everybody needed to eat them
[3102.60 - 3106.68] everybody they needed to eat them for
[3107.52 - 3112.96] survival okay so I'm marinating let's go
[3111.52 - 3115.52] there we go take a look you guys and see
[3112.96 - 3116.64] what you think how's yours coming along
[3115.52 - 3119.44] cuz I know that we're doing this
[3116.64 - 3121.08] together today do you have everything
[3119.44 - 3123.08] you need if you don't have everything
[3121.08 - 3124.72] just make one without something how
[3123.08 - 3126.36] about that like if you don't have the
[3124.72 - 3128.40] Cabbage then make it without cabbage if
[3126.36 - 3130.36] you don't have the ginger then that's
[3128.40 - 3133.84] okay now I just need a little honey in
[3130.36 - 3133.84] here and I'm going to mix it
[3136.00 - 3142.12] up eggs were a really powerful survival
[3143.68 - 3147.72] food people need needed
[3147.84 - 3155.24] them they were a
[3151.08 - 3158.60] lifesaver famine it stopped families
[3155.24 - 3162.44] from starvation in the Dead
[3158.60 - 3166.56] Winter chicken coups were
[3162.44 - 3169.92] everything everybody had a chicken cpop
[3166.56 - 3172.52] everybody had one if they
[3169.92 - 3173.92] could I'm just mixing this up this is a
[3172.52 - 3176.60] little marinade
[3173.92 - 3179.44] here but the the world has
[3176.60 - 3181.84] changed they manipulated the eggs and
[3179.44 - 3183.72] they ruined eggs on people of course you
[3181.84 - 3185.80] can still enjoy them and have them but
[3183.72 - 3189.60] if you get sick someday you're feeding
[3185.80 - 3189.60] whatever pathogens are creating your
[3189.80 - 3195.04] sickness it's not your fault they ruin
[3192.12 - 3196.92] the eggs they just they do diabolical
[3195.04 - 3199.56] things that's how the industry Works
[3196.92 - 3202.72] they do diabolical stuff you must know
[3199.56 - 3206.20] this by now who doesn't know this by
[3202.72 - 3208.52] now let's make some
[3206.20 - 3212.20] nice little fixings
[3208.52 - 3214.40] here for our Millet sushi so I'm just
[3212.20 - 3215.80] going to cut this down back here little
[3214.40 - 3218.24] like
[3215.80 - 3220.60] that we
[3218.24 - 3222.68] go couple of ways you can slice a
[3220.60 - 3227.44] cabbage for
[3222.68 - 3227.44] this you can you can cut it in half this
[3228.92 - 3231.92] way
[3233.24 - 3240.44] okay and then I'm going to make
[3236.56 - 3243.40] these nice pieces like this there we go
[3240.44 - 3244.52] you don't want them so big if you do
[3243.40 - 3247.28] them too
[3244.52 - 3249.24] big what's going to happen is it they
[3247.28 - 3254.08] could pop through they can break through
[3249.24 - 3254.08] your Nori if if you make them too
[3254.96 - 3261.08] big so I'm doing these slices these
[3258.40 - 3263.56] ribbons right out of
[3261.08 - 3265.64] here I don't want them too thick I don't
[3263.56 - 3268.36] want them too thin
[3265.64 - 3272.12] I just don't want big hunky pieces
[3268.36 - 3274.32] that's just not going to work all
[3272.12 - 3275.88] right here we
[3274.32 - 3277.40] go
[3275.88 - 3279.88] nice
[3277.40 - 3282.56] nice I'm going to put this aside if
[3279.88 - 3282.56] you're okay with
[3286.16 - 3291.56] that okay let's
[3289.68 - 3294.08] roll and then we're going to stick some
[3291.56 - 3297.32] eggs in this gory

[3333.56 - 3338.04] cucumber you do a garden cucumber man I
[3336.24 - 3340.80] love leaving the skin on because it's
[3338.04 - 3343.48] not a garden cucumber uh I don't want to
[3340.80 - 3343.48] keep the skin
[3343.60 - 3350.20] on they put waxes on the skin of the
[3347.36 - 3352.84] organic cucumbers they put waxes on
[3350.20 - 3355.92] everything they put all kinds of MSG
[3352.84 - 3357.76] there's nicotine on produce all of that

[3837.84 - 3842.44] company coming over
[3840.00 - 3844.96] later and I'm making these just a little
[3842.44 - 3848.84] differently I want them to have a look
[3844.96 - 3848.84] to them a little presentation to
[3850.12 - 3856.52] them you don't want to stick big hunky
[3854.40 - 3858.76] carrots in

[3861.36 - 3865.68] mean you could do anything you want but
[3863.68 - 3868.92] I'm I'm looking for something here I'm
[3865.68 - 3871.60] searching for something searching for
[3868.92 - 3875.00] certain
[3871.60 - 3875.00] appeal there we
[3875.96 - 3879.44] go so you
[3880.08 - 3886.68] guys
[3882.16 - 3886.68] um got a hankering for eggs right
[3887.60 - 3891.96] now just kidding all
[3892.88 - 3896.16] right boom
[3897.48 - 3905.08] the thing is what people don't
[3900.44 - 3907.92] realize is that everything does
[3905.08 - 3909.36] count when when you're really sick it
[3907.92 - 3912.72] all
[3909.36 - 3915.52] counts and so I like
[3912.72 - 3917.48] to get as much information as I can out
[3915.52 - 3920.04] to people so they can make a decision
[3917.48 - 3921.48] themselves conscious Choice how can you
[3920.04 - 3923.28] make a choice if you don't know the
[3921.48 - 3925.56] truth about something how can you make a
[3923.28 - 3927.96] choice if you don't know what's really
[3925.56 - 3930.92] happening out there how you might have
[3927.96 - 3933.24] been tricked or duped in life
[3930.92 - 3934.96] right can't make a choice if you don't
[3933.24 - 3937.16] know what's going down if you don't know
[3934.96 - 3940.12] what
[3937.16 - 3942.48] happened keep that in
[3940.12 - 3945.12] mind you can make your own decisions you
[3942.48 - 3948.16] can say sure I can have an egg I'll just
[3945.12 - 3950.48] grant myself permission I feel pretty
[3948.16 - 3955.60] good these
[3950.48 - 3958.64] days but I want people to know what's up
[3955.60 - 3960.20] all right we got our carrots going I
[3958.64 - 3963.68] might take these
[3960.20 - 3967.20] CES slice them a little different real
[3963.68 - 3969.12] quick add a different uh look to them
[3967.20 - 3971.60] and we're almost there this is going to
[3969.12 - 3973.96] be really good really
[3971.60 - 3978.88] good
[3973.96 - 3978.88] boom those are actually there we
[3981.12 - 3986.00] go all
[3983.00 - 3986.00] right
[3995.00 - 4001.36] so okay can you guys see this
[3998.04 - 4003.44] still all right just about there and
[4001.36 - 4006.92] we're going to make these Millet sushi
[4003.44 - 4010.48] rolls which are one of my favorites how
[4006.92 - 4010.48] many of you guys have tried these
[4011.16 - 4018.72] before it's like crack
[4015.48 - 4020.88] it's like literally
[4018.72 - 4022.80] kidding did you love when people say
[4020.88 - 4025.76] literally I was actually making a joke
[4022.80 - 4027.88] about that the other day someone told
[4025.76 - 4032.52] they said literally is this I'm like
[4027.88 - 4032.52] really literally like
[4033.04 - 4039.28] what all
[4036.00 - 4042.00] right literally that fish was so fresh
[4039.28 - 4044.96] on the table it it was flapping around
[4042.00 - 4048.60] literally it's a fresh as fish fish they
[4044.96 - 4048.60] use all right let's
[4051.24 - 4054.92] go I'm moving this
[4055.28 - 4059.28] over let's make some
[4060.24 - 4066.24] rolls all right so I don't use a sushi
[4062.48 - 4070.60] mat I hope you guys are okay with that
[4066.24 - 4073.24] like I don't use one I never did I find
[4070.60 - 4074.36] it's harder for some reason so I see a
[4073.24 - 4077.48] lot of beginners when when they make
[4074.36 - 4078.40] Nori they make a Nori roll I see a lot
[4077.48 - 4081.84] of
[4078.40 - 4085.48] beginners they have to have the sushi
[4081.84 - 4086.72] mat and it comes out disastrous or it
[4085.48 - 4089.64] takes them
[4086.72 - 4091.64] forever like rolling them up T like
[4089.64 - 4094.20] takes
[4091.64 - 4096.68] forever I don't do that you can learn
[4094.20 - 4098.68] the trick with your hands really easily
[4096.68 - 4101.72] and you don't need to use a sushi mat
[4098.68 - 4104.48] you just don't have to now if you get
[4101.72 - 4106.24] brand new sheets this is to it Nori
[4104.48 - 4108.56] right here if you get brand new sheets
[4106.24 - 4111.92] fresh out of the package they're going
[4108.56 - 4113.80] to be crumbly when you actually roll
[4111.92 - 4115.60] they're going to break apart and just
[4113.80 - 4117.48] explode on you you're just going to get
[4115.60 - 4118.84] gy everywhere they're going to crack
[4117.48 - 4120.96] they're going to break so I want you
[4118.84 - 4122.56] guys to know that that's going to happen
[4120.96 - 4124.28] the minute you take it fresh out of the
[4122.56 - 4126.44] package like that when it's fresh
[4124.28 - 4128.28] toasted and you open up the vacuum
[4126.44 - 4131.20] sealed pack they're going to just
[4128.28 - 4134.36] explode on you this package was open for
[4131.20 - 4136.60] a while moisture kind of got in here
[4134.36 - 4138.60] and so what you see now is they're not
[4136.60 - 4141.44] breaking apart look at this it's not
[4138.60 - 4144.04] like falling apart on me check that out
[4141.44 - 4146.08] I don't even have to use a lot of liquid
[4144.04 - 4147.84] on here here's another thing a lot of
[4146.08 - 4151.16] people they'll use a lot of water on
[4147.84 - 4153.12] their Nory sheet they'll tear it apart
[4151.16 - 4155.84] so they'll actually get a lot of water
[4153.12 - 4155.84] like this right
[4156.52 - 4161.40] here or more water than that and then as
[4159.84 - 4165.72] they're rolling it up and putting it
[4161.40 - 4165.72] together it's ripping it's tearing apart
[4166.80 - 4170.00] so you don't have to do that when it's
[4168.44 - 4172.12] in this in this phase right here I
[4170.00 - 4176.24] probably put too much water on that one
[4172.12 - 4178.08] so let's go there we go all right now
[4176.24 - 4179.84] this is the marinade what I like to do
[4178.08 - 4183.12] is take a little bit of that marinade
[4179.84 - 4186.40] and I like to dab it on here a little
[4183.12 - 4186.40] bit like
[4188.56 - 4194.84] this gives it
[4190.96 - 4197.60] flavor major flavor
[4194.84 - 4197.60] okay let's get some
[4198.56 - 4205.00] Millet now what I'm going to do is if
[4202.04 - 4207.00] you keep the lid on the Millet won't
[4205.00 - 4209.96] harden up
[4207.00 - 4212.40] yet if you take the lid off it starts to
[4209.96 - 4214.96] harden up a little bit in the in there
[4212.40 - 4217.40] so it's just about right though where we
[4214.96 - 4220.04] got now you want your Millet to the
[4217.40 - 4222.92] edges you don't want a ton of
[4220.04 - 4224.72] millet just a couple of tablespoons you
[4222.92 - 4225.92] don't want too much
[4224.72 - 4229.52] you won't be able to kind of put
[4225.92 - 4229.52] everything else in but you want just
[4235.24 - 4238.64] enough there we
[4243.20 - 4248.12] go you want it to look good when you
[4245.64 - 4248.12] roll this
[4248.92 - 4251.92] up
[4252.04 - 4258.24] okay recipes for from the brain saver
[4254.52 - 4259.80] book protocols all right let's pop in a
[4258.24 - 4263.60] couple of pieces of
[4259.80 - 4265.96] carrot two pieces I allow myself two
[4263.60 - 4267.12] pieces of carrot I'm going to put a
[4265.96 - 4269.28] couple of
[4267.12 - 4271.28] pieces there of
[4269.28 - 4273.48] that
[4271.28 - 4275.56] cucumber I'm going to put a couple of
[4273.48 - 4278.52] these in now this one might be bigger
[4275.56 - 4281.64] than I wanted but it's going to still be
[4278.52 - 4282.96] good and you can choose how you want to
[4281.64 - 4284.16] do it doesn't matter if anything sticks
[4282.96 - 4285.64] out the side
[4284.16 - 4291.28] don't
[4285.64 - 4293.68] worry okay all right here you go now you
[4291.28 - 4295.28] got your Ginger marinade right here I'm
[4293.68 - 4297.64] not going to put it inside the rollup
[4295.28 - 4299.36] but it's still like that I still have to
[4297.64 - 4302.68] make the Wasabi but let's just do this
[4299.36 - 4305.20] first okay by
[4302.68 - 4306.96] hand you're going to get some little bit
[4305.20 - 4308.44] cracks and sometimes whatever but that
[4306.96 - 4311.32] is it right
[4308.44 - 4314.12] there
[4311.32 - 4316.04] okay now I can slice that now and give
[4314.12 - 4319.48] you just a real quick show of it I'll
[4316.04 - 4324.92] put it over
[4319.48 - 4324.92] here one of the tricks is when you
[4326.04 - 4332.48] slice you don't want to push down you
[4329.36 - 4335.40] want to like slice you're going like the
[4332.48 - 4337.12] saw action see what I'm doing letting
[4335.40 - 4339.64] you guys know so so it's not going to
[4337.12 - 4342.20] get destroyed on you I don't like the
[4339.64 - 4344.04] ends too small because they'll just fall
[4342.20 - 4347.28] apart so I like it
[4344.04 - 4351.28] big enough now I'm doing a
[4347.28 - 4353.48] saw there we go and I cut right down to
[4351.28 - 4353.48] the
[4353.84 - 4359.32] bone take a look you can make them
[4356.96 - 4364.64] smaller if you really want but I'm
[4359.32 - 4364.64] making a pretty good bite size look at
[4366.04 - 4369.92] this remember you got to do the sawing
[4368.24 - 4372.20] action make sure your knife is pretty
[4369.92 - 4373.52] sharp make sure it's not too dull now I
[4372.20 - 4375.80] got a problem here at the end you can
[4373.52 - 4377.44] use this as one big end just like that
[4375.80 - 4379.84] or you can cut it and get one more out
[4377.44 - 4382.84] of it I'm going to try to cut and get
[4379.84 - 4384.64] one more out of it who knows what we get
[4382.84 - 4387.72] okay
[4384.64 - 4390.00] yep all right I just want to get this
[4387.72 - 4390.00] first
[4391.48 - 4394.80] one on
[4397.80 - 4402.32] here you know I've made them so many
[4400.48 - 4405.36] times meaning different Nori rolls for
[4402.32 - 4405.36] so many years
[4407.24 - 4410.96] right so you got a couple little pieces
[4409.52 - 4414.36] of Mill it around but there you go
[4410.96 - 4414.36] that's the start let's make some
[4415.36 - 4420.72] more kind of clean off your board a
[4417.56 - 4424.44] little bit so you don't have Millet on
[4420.72 - 4424.44] everything let's get another
[4426.92 - 4431.92] sheet now the reason why I'm choosing
[4429.32 - 4434.96] Millet and not rice a lot of people
[4431.92 - 4437.24] sensitive to Rice
[4434.96 - 4439.12] people need an option
[4437.24 - 4443.24] Millet has the
[4439.12 - 4443.24] potential of being the least
[4443.28 - 4449.84] inflammatory it's the safest grain there
[4446.68 - 4452.12] is hands down if you're a grain person
[4449.84 - 4456.80] and you're eating a ton of rice I would
[4452.12 - 4460.00] flip to Millet if you guys are okay with
[4456.80 - 4462.28] that so let's get some Millet on
[4460.00 - 4464.28] here did I say
[4462.28 - 4468.28] millet
[4464.28 - 4468.28] okay let's move this best we can
[4469.12 - 4472.44] over there we
[4473.40 - 4478.68] go
[4475.12 - 4482.68] okay it's the least irritating for
[4478.68 - 4485.72] people it's the least mucus
[4482.68 - 4487.20] forming okay a lot of people have mucus
[4485.72 - 4489.24] they have a lot of
[4487.20 - 4490.40] mucus because they're dealing with all
[4489.24 - 4492.04] kinds of different stuff that I've
[4490.40 - 4495.20] talked about the medical medium
[4492.04 - 4497.36] information but it's the least mucus
[4495.20 - 4500.60] forming in the
[4497.36 - 4502.96] body it's an what I call an alkaline
[4500.60 - 4506.92] grain that's a big deal all on its
[4502.96 - 4510.20] own it's one of the only
[4506.92 - 4513.28] grains that isn't that that's an what I
[4510.20 - 4516.68] call an alkaline it's high on its pH
[4513.28 - 4520.16] it's High baby it's high all right let's
[4516.68 - 4522.20] get some of this here carrots get a
[4520.16 - 4524.32] couple of them in
[4522.20 - 4526.80] here
[4524.32 - 4529.32] nice I'm putting three carrots in here
[4526.80 - 4530.32] this time let's get some of the cucumber
[4529.32 - 4532.56] in
[4530.32 - 4534.88] here so if you're somebody that's doing
[4532.56 - 4538.00] grains anyway like your big thing like
[4534.88 - 4541.48] you're like look I'm I'm macrobiotic I'm
[4538.00 - 4544.00] all grains there's some dinosaurs left
[4541.48 - 4545.64] maybe that are like macrobiotic people
[4544.00 - 4547.80] like I'm pretty sure there there's
[4545.64 - 4549.48] there's not too many out there anymore
[4547.80 - 4552.20] they've been just beat they've had so
[4549.48 - 4554.32] many beatdowns about grains being so bad
[4552.20 - 4557.84] right all right so we got all that in
[4554.32 - 4560.20] there let's roll this baby roll this
[4557.84 - 4563.64] puppy like I said I don't like the sushi
[4560.20 - 4563.64] mat I like it by
[4564.52 - 4569.48] hand got a little tear on that one on
[4567.04 - 4573.04] the back end and that will happen I
[4569.48 - 4574.28] might not put any more moisture on these
[4573.04 - 4578.12] but there we
[4574.28 - 4578.12] go may cut this one
[4578.36 - 4583.84] here do some sawing
[4581.20 - 4586.60] action now it's inab
[4583.84 - 4588.32] you're going to get braks no matter what
[4586.60 - 4591.76] in your Nory
[4588.32 - 4595.12] Sheets if you're like not used to doing
[4591.76 - 4598.36] these on any level roll two and I'll
[4595.12 - 4601.32] show you doing two at a
[4598.36 - 4603.24] time you can go to Medical medium.com at
[4601.32 - 4605.84] the supplement directory in the section
[4603.24 - 4607.24] you can that has the kitchen tools and
[4605.84 - 4609.04] you can see that section there and you
[4607.24 - 4612.16] can find what I'm using today I'm going
[4609.04 - 4615.20] to be using a Wasabi which I still have
[4612.16 - 4615.20] to make the you know the the
[4616.68 - 4622.52] Wasabi go to the food
[4619.64 - 4624.92] section now some of these are just like
[4622.52 - 4626.56] you can do the best you can but you're
[4624.92 - 4629.44] always going to get a Nory sheet that's
[4626.56 - 4629.44] not going to
[4629.72 - 4637.04] cooperate it's like you you know you do
[4631.88 - 4637.04] the best you can with what you have so
[4638.08 - 4641.48] far all right I'm liking these now what
[4640.28 - 4645.00] I'm going to do with this one is I'm not
[4641.48 - 4645.00] going to add any moisture to this one
[4646.36 - 4649.56] okay I'm going to leave this one just
[4648.56 - 4653.04] like
[4649.56 - 4656.68] this the moisture will actually cause a
[4653.04 - 4659.88] break let's get some Millet on here I'm
[4656.68 - 4659.88] sorry am I boring
[4661.68 - 4668.76] you so told me that someone said oh my
[4664.76 - 4671.76] God I'm bored because I just want to eat
[4668.76 - 4673.72] them but how come you're not making them
[4671.76 - 4675.68] then how how are you going to eat them
[4673.72 - 4678.68] if you're not making them you got to
[4675.68 - 4678.68] make them to eat
[4679.20 - 4684.12] them all
[4681.88 - 4686.52] right now I put a decent amount of
[4684.12 - 4689.60] millet in this
[4686.52 - 4691.24] one you can go less you could go more I
[4689.60 - 4693.52] decided to put a little bit more Millet
[4691.24 - 4695.88] in this one I'm going to make this one a
[4693.52 - 4699.08] little bit more fatter let's get these
[4695.88 - 4699.08] cucumber slices in
[4701.08 - 4707.48] here I'm going to do one carrot in this
[4703.72 - 4710.56] one I'm going to do some more
[4707.48 - 4714.52] cabbage all right David says this is
[4710.56 - 4714.52] like watching PMP it's
[4722.20 - 4726.28] soothing all right let's roll it
[4728.56 - 4733.20] up now like what I did this time was I
[4731.36 - 4736.32] made it a little bigger it's a little
[4733.20 - 4737.48] bit more plump was that a bad idea not
[4736.32 - 4740.56] sure I'm going to put a little bit of
[4737.48 - 4740.56] moisture on the
[4743.04 - 4750.04] edge boom that's a nice one right there
[4747.40 - 4753.48] that's what I'm talking
[4750.04 - 4756.32] about that's what I'm talking about okay
[4753.48 - 4757.76] slice this up you know what I'm saying
[4756.32 - 4758.96] you ever run into somebody like you know
[4757.76 - 4760.44] what I'm saying you see what I'm saying
[4758.96 - 4762.56] I'm like yeah I see what you're saying
[4760.44 - 4765.44] no you see what I'm saying man I go yeah
[4762.56 - 4765.44] I see see what you're
[4765.56 - 4772.68] saying I'm just saying I know you're
[4768.72 - 4774.08] just saying it's okay I do that a lot I
[4772.68 - 4777.32] do that a
[4774.08 - 4777.32] lot all
[4778.24 - 4783.36] right okay some of these are going to be
[4780.60 - 4785.28] a little crazy let's just get this going
[4783.36 - 4786.76] let's kind of do a little close-up on
[4785.28 - 4789.96] here like
[4786.76 - 4792.20] this where'd you go remember when you're
[4789.96 - 4794.24] slicing make sure you slice all the way
[4792.20 - 4798.64] to the bottom and they're not
[4794.24 - 4798.64] connected multitasking man
[4801.32 - 4807.60] multitasking you know what I love about
[4804.32 - 4810.00] this this isn't going to feed any
[4807.60 - 4813.60] pathogens this isn't going to feed any
[4810.00 - 4816.32] bugs yeast mold fungus it's not going to
[4813.60 - 4818.48] feed any of that over there on IG o aw
[4816.32 - 4821.20] you always put a smile on my face even
[4818.48 - 4824.80] when I'm struggling with symptoms every
[4821.20 - 4827.16] day that means a lot to me that means a
[4824.80 - 4830.44] great deal to
[4827.16 - 4832.76] me thank you for being here
[4830.44 - 4835.12] and bless your heart let's get some more
[4832.76 - 4838.56] Millet going
[4835.12 - 4841.32] on I'm trying to be careful with these I
[4838.56 - 4844.32] don't want to butcher
[4841.32 - 4844.32] these
[4844.68 - 4850.52] okay if you just got here you're in aw's
[4847.52 - 4851.72] kitchen we annihilated eggs I hope
[4850.52 - 4853.52] everybody's
[4851.72 - 4854.76] okay
[4853.52 - 4857.68] all right and then we're going to try to
[4854.76 - 4857.68] move this over
[4858.40 - 4864.88] here there we
[4860.72 - 4867.60] go we're using Millet Millet an alkaline
[4864.88 - 4869.80] grain it's the only grain that's
[4867.60 - 4872.40] actually
[4869.80 - 4874.32] alkaline if that like matters to you
[4872.40 - 4876.28] guys or not some people that matters
[4874.32 - 4879.16] greatly that's a big deal to some people
[4876.28 - 4882.24] out there like is it alkaline like is it
[4879.16 - 4885.24] alkaline what's the pH is it up there
[4882.24 - 4887.84] this one is this grain is so for grains
[4885.24 - 4887.84] that's what this
[4888.20 - 4894.40] is let's put a couple of pieces of
[4891.76 - 4898.40] cucumber let's not be a nemic about it
[4894.40 - 4902.48] and then we'll do couple of carrots we
[4898.40 - 4905.16] will get some cabbage in there now too
[4902.48 - 4906.92] let's roll this puppy
[4905.16 - 4910.44] up all
[4906.92 - 4913.16] right thing is with
[4910.44 - 4914.64] people you know I told totally
[4913.16 - 4917.60] understand it's like you get programmed
[4914.64 - 4922.16] on the food you eat and you can't break
[4917.60 - 4924.40] it and then even if you've healed you go
[4922.16 - 4926.76] back to that food you know you go back
[4924.40 - 4928.80] to that food there's a break in that one
[4926.76 - 4932.16] it's a little bit more
[4928.80 - 4936.16] difficult that Nory sheet let's make
[4932.16 - 4936.16] another let's get this one up
[4936.52 - 4940.92] here let's go there we
[4941.56 - 4945.32] go
[4943.24 - 4947.56] a lot of people will use medical medium
[4945.32 - 4950.24] information and they'll start
[4947.56 - 4952.84] healing they'll spend 2 years 3 years on
[4950.24 - 4955.72] it they've gotten rid of 10 out of their
[4952.84 - 4958.80] 20 symptoms that no doctor could get rid
[4955.72 - 4960.48] of they've gotten rid of 15 symptoms out
[4958.80 - 4963.72] of their 20 symptoms that no doctor can
[4960.48 - 4966.92] get rid of no practitioner can get rid
[4963.72 - 4969.24] of no self-help course can get rid
[4966.92 - 4970.60] of they started recovering started
[4969.24 - 4972.00] getting better and better started
[4970.60 - 4973.56] talking about the medical medium
[4972.00 - 4975.24] information supporting the medical
[4973.56 - 4977.56] medium information talking about how
[4975.24 - 4980.04] great it
[4977.56 - 4981.32] is they get to a point they're just sick
[4980.04 - 4987.20] of doing
[4981.32 - 4987.20] it or you know they want to do something
[4991.16 - 4995.00] else meanwhile without that medical meme
[4993.56 - 4997.32] information they wouldn't be in the
[4995.00 - 4997.32] place they
[5001.48 - 5006.36] are
[5004.32 - 5008.32] all right we got some cucumber in here
[5006.36 - 5009.52] I'm doing four pieces of cucumber I'm
[5008.32 - 5012.36] going to do
[5009.52 - 5014.84] two carrot sticks right there let's get
[5012.36 - 5016.68] some more cabbage I really like
[5014.84 - 5019.88] these and then we're going to do some
[5016.68 - 5021.84] Wasabi we're almost there all right now
[5019.88 - 5024.84] keep in mind the Cabbage will tear into
[5021.84 - 5026.96] this these norish sheets you know hard
[5024.84 - 5029.88] like crunchy vegetables will actually
[5026.96 - 5031.96] rip and tear in so you you when you're
[5029.88 - 5033.92] rolling it up this is when you can tear
[5031.96 - 5036.44] you know but yet you want it tight
[5033.92 - 5038.44] enough because you don't want it Loose
[5036.44 - 5040.60] there you go that's actually a really
[5038.44 - 5040.60] good
[5040.96 - 5045.80] one
[5042.92 - 5048.40] okay py Ren says I always feel better
[5045.80 - 5051.28] after watching aw live just like with
[5048.40 - 5056.44] PNP Pride and Prejudice Pride and
[5051.28 - 5058.44] Prejudice 1995 version critical to know
[5056.44 - 5061.64] more light-hearted and even symptoms
[5058.44 - 5064.12] pull back so your nervous system is
[5061.64 - 5066.56] relaxing when you're watching medical
[5064.12 - 5069.24] medium and so so your nervous system is
[5066.56 - 5073.36] calming down your mind
[5069.24 - 5075.52] calms y listen to my audio on telegram I

[5083.20 - 5090.56] out the the last four I think four three
[5086.20 - 5093.00] or four um audio clips that I did about
[5090.56 - 5096.16] Pride and Prejudice how how important it
[5093.00 - 5097.88] is how how like healing it is why
[5096.16 - 5101.72] because Darkness wasn't in the film
[5097.88 - 5103.40] production on that you know because the
[5101.72 - 5106.56] problem people don't realize that in a
[5103.40 - 5108.64] lot of documentaries and a lot of movies
[5106.56 - 5111.72] a lot of TV there's Darkness
[5108.64 - 5113.52] involved on all kinds of levels and
[5111.72 - 5116.32] there there wasn't any in that it just
[5113.52 - 5118.24] really incredible process that happened
[5116.32 - 5120.16] it's one of those Miracles and when you
[5118.24 - 5122.64] watch Pride and
[5120.16 - 5124.96] Prejudice you'll you'll feel it you'll
[5122.64 - 5126.84] see even if you don't like the story
[5124.96 - 5129.48] line if you don't like Jane Austin
[5126.84 - 5130.84] originally whatever it is it's really
[5129.48 - 5133.24] something
[5130.84 - 5137.32] special something to
[5133.24 - 5140.12] experience it's easy on the system it's

[5275.36 - 5280.40] fresh fresh out of the right out of the

[5280.40 - 5285.84] here nice let's get this
[5283.68 - 5289.20] going now I don't know if you guys ever

[5297.76 - 5304.32] it blows your sinuses out so if you've
[5300.80 - 5304.32] never done it just kind of be
[5309.96 - 5313.40] cautious okay need a little bit of water
[5312.44 - 5317.52] in
[5313.40 - 5317.52] this so I'm going to drop a
[5323.16 - 5327.68] touch go a little bit at a time you
[5325.32 - 5329.76] don't want it sloppy you don't want it
[5327.68 - 5332.40] like sloppy
[5329.76 - 5335.04] wet you want to make sure it's it's got
[5332.40 - 5337.40] some consistency you don't want it dry
[5335.04 - 5339.68] to the Bone either so I'm going to go
[5337.40 - 5339.68] one
[5340.28 - 5344.12] tablespoon I'm going to go with another
[5342.48 - 5348.92] tablespoon right
[5344.12 - 5351.56] here of some water a lot of people use
[5348.92 - 5354.72] Namo you they use
[5351.56 - 5357.52] tamari they use coconut aminos keep in
[5354.72 - 5360.60] mind you don't want to put that in your
[5357.52 - 5362.80] Wasabi together in the mix you'll ruin
[5360.60 - 5365.68] the flavor of the wasabi you'll destroy
[5362.80 - 5367.68] it I see people I've seen them out there
[5365.68 - 5369.52] this is a perfect consistency of Wasabi
[5367.68 - 5373.00] right here and then I'm going to put it
[5369.52 - 5373.00] in a smaller little glass
[5373.60 - 5376.84] bowl I
[5377.04 - 5380.44] think you don't want to destroy your
[5379.00 - 5382.04] Wasabi and you don't want to put
[5380.44 - 5386.08] something else in there you just want
[5382.04 - 5386.08] water in there you have to trust me on
