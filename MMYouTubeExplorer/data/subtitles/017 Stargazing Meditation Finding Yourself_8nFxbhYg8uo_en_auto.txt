[13.36 - 19.80] stargazing meditation there's a hidden
[16.68 - 23.04] surprise way above the sky that will
[19.80 - 26.48] always be there for you long before we
[23.04 - 29.32] die to bring back and restore a part of
[26.48 - 32.32] us that gets beaten down here on Earth
[29.32 - 35.40] sending us on a spiritual search because
[32.32 - 39.52] we get lost in the Lurch it's time to
[35.40 - 42.96] find out what's behind the Stars far far
[39.52 - 45.32] away from planet Mars you can't get
[42.96 - 49.04] there by driving a car it would be way
[45.32 - 52.48] too hard there's an easier way to reach
[49.04 - 55.68] Above The Ether and heal the wounds we
[52.48 - 58.80] receive from people that are meaner but
[55.68 - 62.08] that's okay we can fix all the cracks
[58.80 - 65.72] when our soul spirit and heart get
[62.08 - 67.96] hacked the stargazing meditation has
[65.72 - 67.96] your

[78.64 - 84.80] the nighttime try to get a glimpse of
[81.32 - 87.36] the Stars even if it's just for a moment
[84.80 - 89.96] you do not have to see the stars in
[87.36 - 92.64] order to do the meditation it will be
[89.96 - 94.96] just as effective and Powerful there is
[92.64 - 98.36] a built-in safety mechanism for your
[94.96 - 101.16] soul so it can stay safe and never get
[98.36 - 104.68] completely lost while being down here on
[101.16 - 107.28] Earth your soul is here within you
[104.68 - 110.00] inside you and if we're up against
[107.28 - 113.60] emotional stress it can be hard on our
[110.00 - 116.68] soul your soul is who you are it's what
[113.60 - 119.28] lives on forever and ever as we go
[116.68 - 120.48] through life we can experience hardship
[119.28 - 122.96] and pain
[120.48 - 125.12] from losses and difficult
[122.96 - 127.56] experiences sometimes brought on by
[125.12 - 129.96] others through betrayal and other
[127.56 - 133.24] emotional struggles from everyday twists
[129.96 - 136.92] and turns life challenges us with broken
[133.24 - 139.56] trust emotional stress wrongdoing broken
[136.92 - 142.56] promises and disappointments can make us
[139.56 - 145.20] doubt ourselves make us wonder if we are
[142.56 - 148.08] good enough if we deserve good things in
[145.20 - 151.08] life we can lose ourselves and feel like
[148.08 - 153.84] a part of us is missing the self-doubt
[151.08 - 156.08] becomes a weight upon us in our soul and
[153.84 - 159.20] can challenge our very being in
[156.08 - 162.88] existence leading to anxiety
[159.20 - 165.28] depersonalization PTSD and depression
[162.88 - 167.96] one special way to rise from the
[165.28 - 170.16] self-doubt and fear and heal the wounds
[167.96 - 172.92] within our soul is to have a special
[170.16 - 176.12] knowing that is always there for you
