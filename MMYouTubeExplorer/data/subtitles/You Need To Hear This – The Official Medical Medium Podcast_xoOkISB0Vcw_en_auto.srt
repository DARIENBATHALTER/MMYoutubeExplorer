people think we're losing bees they

69
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,680

of gmo

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
they think we're losing it all because

72
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,520

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920

fragmented

122
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,799
you might not have heard the whole

123
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,280
in mind if you're used to listening to

125
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
it on a

126
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
another platform because it might be

127
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
worth

128
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,959
going to where it's really guaranteed to

129
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
ahead

138
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,000
it's perfectly fine and i mean there's

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,639
even powerful hidden messages spiritual

140
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
messages

141
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,880

142
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
you can look out for that

143
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
just know that when you listen to this

144
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,440
episode

145
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,520
it's packed with details and information

146
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,919
you might have to listen to it twice

147
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
or even more than twice in order to

148
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,199
actually glean and gather

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,040
all that information there's so much and

150
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
love you guys too patty says love you

151
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
anthony love you too

152
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,600
um mm podcasts uh

153
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
have been out there no that the mm

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
podcast in the past that was an old

155
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
radio show

156
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
so that wasn't the mm official medical

157
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
meeting podcast

158
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,240
big difference i'm just letting you know

159
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,880
this is an entirely different situation

160
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
if you're used to my old radio shows

161
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,720
those were censored because pretty much

162
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,960
it wasn't my podcast a whole bit

163
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
this is the medical medium official

164
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,440
podcast

165
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,520
just tried and true this is it um and

166
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
and it's it's exciting the first episode

167
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,039
is chemtrails the sky is falling

168
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,360
um if you're somebody in in your and you

169
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
like

170
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
being in the world you're in now you

171
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,400
don't want to know about certain things

172
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,120
i would sit that episode out because

173
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,400
that episode chemtrails is just

174
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,759
it's it's scary it's in it's a scary

175
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,440
episode so i'm just

176
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,520
giving you kind of the forewarning a

177
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,360
little kind of forewarning there

178
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,360
um but if you think you can handle it

179
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,000
and handle the truth or handle

180
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
the truth but more than that the

181
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
information

182
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
at you know at its entirety there then

183
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,479
if you feel like you can handle such a

184
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,720
shocker then

185
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,000

so

244
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
medical medium information has always

245
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
been about advanced unique original

246
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,759
information it's not like other podcasts

247
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,919
okay

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,240
other podcasts they're regurgitating the

249
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,639
same old stuff they're regurgitating

250
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
misinformation about health and just

251
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,599
swimming it around swimming

252
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,199
around they have guests come on and it's

253
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
all the same stuff unless

254
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
they took pieces from medical medium

255
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,560
information for the 35

256
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
years of putting out unique information

257
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,000
and then it gets taken not cited back

258
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
and then it becomes out

259
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
there like that but this is different

260
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,000
medical medium information has always

261
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,120
been about ahead of its time

262
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,919
by decades and even more and what you'll

263
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,039
find

264
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,280
in this podcast is that plus even

265
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,960
more it's going to be to a whole another

chemtrail episode

439
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
so people know where that information

440
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
comes from because if you know something

441
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,199
about chemtrails

442
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
you'll find out that you don't know

443
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,920
about chemtrails

444
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,160
you know yeah you'll know something

445
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,160
about them from the misinformation

446
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
and the theories out there but when you

447
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,399
actually hear the truth of what really

448
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
happened why these chemtrails are here

449
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
what's going on and you learn that

450
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,800
it's a whole different ballpark and that

451
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
information will then get saturated out

452
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
there it won't get cited back to me

453
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
probably eventually

454
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,920
and then it'll be like oh oh the that's

455
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,639
where it comes from out there somewhere

456
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,160
no you'll it originates here like 35

457
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
years of medical mean information that

458
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,199
has escaped through

459
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
toxic heavy metals talk about that

460
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,440
originates from medical medium

461
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,360

462
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440

keep destroying ourselves the human race

531

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,799
episodes too in some different ways

535
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
it's evil tricking the good

539
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
and that's been around for centuries and

540
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,320
centuries and centuries it's been around

541
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,400
since the beginning of the human race

542
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760

543
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
you'll protect yourself from the whole

544
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,520
bit and we can rise out of the ashes

545
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,400

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
it's such an incredible podcast i

775
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
thought i knew about chemtrails

776
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,080
but this filled in the gaps and all of

777
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,440
the details made it to the next level

778
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,559
each other you know it's it's um exactly

779
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,640
because

780
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
there just isn't really enough

781
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,000
information or

782
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
barely any information on any level out

783
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,240
there in chemtrails and this

784
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,480
this is the eye opener this is this is

785
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,360
this is the package of information that

786
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,400

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,720
people can

788
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,880

793
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,840
