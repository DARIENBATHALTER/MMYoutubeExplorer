that you haven't had

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,880
that's the medical meat morning cleanse

51
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
challenge you're not supposed to do your

52
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
fats in the morning

53
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,320

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439

avocado toast until afternoon

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
i'm assuming

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
which could be dangerous because like we

60
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799

191
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,720
right

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
because this is about answers it's not

193
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,880
about guessing games it's not about

194
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,440
mysteries this is about knowing why

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
we're sick we're doing day two of the

196
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
medical medium

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,240
morning cleanse challenge

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,680
so i want to talk about this thing right

199
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,880
what's the first thing you think when

200
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
you see a homeless person

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,400
first thing i think is what what is

202
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,479
their health condition right

203
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,120
because i just feel awful

204
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
for them right

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
another thing i'll think is

206
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,919
right

207
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
is

208
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,319
there in some pretty dirty clothes

209
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,160
okay and

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,280
their clothes haven't been washed in a

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,280
very long time

212
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,720
god knows when they've had a bath

213
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,160
and you just feel bad for them right

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
and

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
the next thing is

216
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
you know

217
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
anybody's like oh well we don't have

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
that in common right we're always taking

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
care of ourselves we're always washing

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
our clothes we're taking showers we're

221
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,039
taking baths

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
we don't have that in common but we do

223
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
have something in common

224
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,479
outside of being a human because

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
homeless people they're humans too

226
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,879
obviously even though they're not

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
treated like that

228
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,680
what we have in common is

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,519
we can get dirty on the inside

230
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,519
we can get dirty on the inside

231
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,719
all the trash gets built it built up on

232
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,719
the inside is what it does

233
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,720
you guys get what i'm saying right

234
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,440
i know people they're squeaky clean

235
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,160
squeaky clean so much it annoys me

236
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,839
because i go weeks without showering or

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,680

271
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,160
coming all out of them

272
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,480

they're not clean internally they're

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,640
filled with everything under the sun

275
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,160

live jan mcbride says but don't potatoes

351
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,600
have high glycemic index that can cause

352
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,480
alzheimer's

353
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,120
no but that's misinformation

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,920
from people in the health industry that

355
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,399
will cheat you jan out of healing so

356
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,920
someday you do get alzheimer's and

357
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,560
that's what that is that's

358
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,560
misinformation out there in the world

359
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,760
and it's really sad

360
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,800
it's sad what they do out there okay so

361
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
potatoes are a healing food and when

362
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,399
they rob people of that information it's

363
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
really sad because

364
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,000
how are they going to heal

365
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,600
what's incredible is alzheimer's is on

366
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,399
the rise and and it's rising fast right

367
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
and

368
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
potatoes not on the big list for people

369
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,240

370
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,320

371
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,120

394
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,639
guarantee you that there isn't alzheimer

395
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,279
patients out there on papaya getting

396
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,519
their mind back there's not alzheimer

397
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,079
patients doing the medical media morning

398
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,519
cleanse usually they're not you know

399
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,120
unless they learned about it through a

400
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
family member family member takes the

401
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,480
medical mean warning cleanse to their

402
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
elder who has alzheimer's and that's a

403
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,519
different story but normally it just

404
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,279
doesn't work that way can potatoes cause

405
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,920
constipation

406
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,600
uh no they can't so what i'm doing is

407
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,800
i'm gonna get some potatoes out now that

408
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,839
are steamed they're gonna go in the

409
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
skillet

410
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,720
we're gonna get them going over here

411
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
we're just cooking this down a little

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
bit

413
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
what causes constipation is an inflamed

414
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,680
intestinal tract it's why we're even

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
doing this you should listen to the

416
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,120
potato podcast at medical medium podcast

417
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,160
at apple podcast so

418
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,040
an inflamed intestinal tract right here

419
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,440
okay

420
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,839
an inflamed intestinal tract

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,759
is why people have constipation so

422
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,680
that's important to know

423
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
so what you do is you have to realize if

424
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
you're inflamed

425
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
but first of all you're gonna have a

426
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
sluggish liver if you're inflamed all in

427
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
there and you have constipation that's

428
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
first first and foremost to understand

429
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,320
it's critical information right there

430
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
but if you have inflammation somewhere

431
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
inside your intestinal tract your small

432
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,480
intestinal tract your ilium if you have

433
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
if you have inflammation in your helium

434
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
down in here on the right hand side okay

435
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,839
where you're where your small intestinal

436
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,759
tract links into your

437
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
large large intestinal tract if you're

438
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
inflamed in here that's where the

439
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,120
constipation comes from

440
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,560
ninety percent of constipation cases are

441
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
because you're actually sick you've got

442
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,839
an inflammation going on here

443
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,639
so potato doesn't cause constipation

444
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,800
but other foods like dairy products and

445
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,399
butter and stuff like that will cause

446
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
and gluten too because it'll feed

447
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
whatever the inflammation is causing

448
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,199
this whatever the bugs are it's causing

449
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,880
that helium to be inflamed right there

450
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,279

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,720

647
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,840
would teach doctors and all of a sudden

648
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600

649
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,400

you can't put your lemon juice

722
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,840
in

723
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,720
hot water so you can't put your

724
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,760
living

725
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
okay

726
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,919
living hydrating

727
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,840
calcium rich trace mineral rich

728
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,960
phytochemical compound rich

729
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,720
juice lemon juice in hot water or you

730
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,880
kill

731
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
you kill what's in here

732
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,600
and then it won't flush now you can have

733
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,679
tea if you want you want herbal tea and

734
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,279
put lemon in there that's perfectly fine

735
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
but it's not going to be a flushing

736
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,200
agent it's just going to be something

737
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,200
else which is what you can do that's a

738
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,159
different story

739
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,640
someone asked on tick tock why no no why

740
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,720
no nutritional yeast

741
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,679
nutritional yeast

742
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,760
is toxic yeast is toxic

743
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,760
so we're not supposed to be consuming or

744
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,000
eating yeast okay

745
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,520
so yeast contains msg right

746
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,039
don't get confused you're going to think

747
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,520
well no that's not true because i keep

748
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,159
on looking up on google

749
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,919
on google right

750
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
i'm on google here

751
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,960
nutritional yeast is really good for us

752
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,480
it offers so many fortified vitamins and

753
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,480
nutrients

754
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
and it's great for your kids too look

755
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,720
here's a mom

756
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,960
putting nutritional yeast

757
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,799
on her children's food making a nice

758
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,679
recipe of nutritional yeast

759
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,600
and she's a very healthy looking mom

760
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,120
and she's all happy and the kids are

761
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,720
eating their treats and it's all great

762
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
they got nutritional yeast in there what

763
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,520
people don't realize

764
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,320
is

765
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,559
it damages the brain over time it

766
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,559
weakens the brain

767
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,360
nutritional yeast has glutamic acid

768
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,440
naturally occurring but it's a bad bad

769
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,799
glutamic acid it's an irritant on the

770
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,480
central nervous system so if you've got

771
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,320
chronic illness nutritional yeast will

772
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,720
send you downhill

773
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,080
it will stop you from healing

774
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,679
so that's just one thing about

775
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,840
nutritional yeast if it's a nutritional

776
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,399

this is just beautiful okay can you

1012
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,640
imagine you can still cleanse

1013
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,440

you can still cleanse

1016
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:16,560
how is that possible well one reason is

1017
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,000
you had your lemon water

1018
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,440
you had your celery juice

1019
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,079
you're not eating pork

1020
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,480
you're not eating oil

1021
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,960
you're not eating eggs

1022
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,000
you're not eating cheese

1023
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,160
you're not having butter

1024
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,839
you're not having avocado

1025
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
i know that's a healthy fat i get it i

1026
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,680
know but you put your but it's still a

1027
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,079
fat and it stops you from cleansing

1028
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,920
you're not having avocado you're not

1029
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:52,000

it's heartbreaking that i have trust

1100
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,960
issues with my doctors

1101
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,680
my nutritionists why are they not

1102
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,160
helping us they say insulin is from

1103
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,480
carbs to sugar anything you put in your

1104
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,520
body spikes insulin please help me have

1105
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,440
faith

1106
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
so joey clark this is how it works it's

1107
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,160
not sugar that gives somebody insulin

1108
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,160
resistance it's fat so it's fat in their

1109
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,800
bloodstream so what they don't realize

1110
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,359
it and this is why diabetics stay sick

1111
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,680
and stay sick and stay sick you can get

1112
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,920
rid of type 2 diabetes that's the

1113
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,760
easiest thing you can do it's it's if

1114
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,960
someone came to me

1115
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,119
right

1116
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,680
and they were like i got this type 2

1117

have to keep the fats out of the diet

1121
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,160
for a little bit you have to bring in

1122
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,240
other foods i talk about this in the

1123
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,280
medical medium books right and you can

1124
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,520
get rid of diabetes i mean it's really

1125
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,760
easy to get rid of type 2 diabetes

1126
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,319
that's just boom gone

1127
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,079
important to know i mean

1128
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,400
they don't have it right it's why

1129
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,040
everybody stays sick

1130
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,280
sugar's what is what your brain

1131
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,359
has to thrive and live on you know a

1132
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,800
diabetic that falls into a diabetic you

1133
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,599
know pass out

1134
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,440
a diabetic diabetic pass out on you know

1135
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,880
a football field or

1136
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,760
or on a baseball diamond or in a bus or

1137
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,599
just in a hallway somewhere in a school

1138
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,520
the only way to revive them is to put a

1139
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,440
little orange juice in their mouth

1140
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,800
because their brain has to get a little

1141
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,880
bit of sugar

1142
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,400
so you have to know that they have it

1143
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,280
wrong about diabetes

1144
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,200
and

1145
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,280
cleansing is just you know it's a part

1146
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,880
of it is you you have to cleanse out all

1147
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,720
the bad stuff you have to give your

1148
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,680
liver a break your pancreas a break and

1149
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,359
that's what the morning cleanse

1150
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,000
challenge does so it takes somebody to

1151
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,520
that place of healing so that's the dish

1152
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,119
right there let's keep on moving i mean

1153
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,200
there's a lot of information i can drop

1154
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,920
on diabetes but we we don't have the

1155
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,599
time get the books so that you have that

1156
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,680
information so you can learn how to heal

1157
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,280
completely with that

1158
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,880
so we're doing a liver rescue smoothie

1159
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,520
but i want to actually just strain this

1160
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,520
really quick

1161
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,240
so this is the celery juice we just used

1162
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,680
if you guys

1163
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,400
just if you guys throw everything out

1164
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,000
everything you're learning here

1165
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,520
and you just do your celery juice

1166
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,280
the needle moves

1167
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,680
just that alone right

1168
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,520
if you throw everything out here and you

1169
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,880

if you throw everything out here and

1173
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,160
just do the lemon water every single

1174
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,480
morning you'll move the needle in some

1175
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,640
way somehow medical medium tools are

1176
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,640
powerful and when they're all combined

1177
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,720
they take somebody all the way to the

1178
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,760
finish line the chronically ill that's

1179
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,200

1180
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,200

hand like this and do the knife like

1458
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,319
this i always do it that way but do not

1459
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,200

1463
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,160

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,960
okay good question

1470
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,599
that papaya is ripe

1471
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,119
somebody else's green papaya might be

1472
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,640
hard as a rock

1473
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,400
and not ripe

1474
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,440
the kind of papayas i've been getting

1475
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,839
lately they ripen inside even when

1476
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,240
they're green with slight yellow on them

1477
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,319
but see you have to know about papayas

1478
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,319
because you can let it ripen more but

1479
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,319
these were ripe but that's just the kind

1480
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:49,119
of papaya it is so

1481
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:52,079
here's what i'll do

it's medical medium information bex

1612
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:39,440
so the doc obviously secretly follows

1613
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,960
medical medium because it was published

1614
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,400

but i'm

1620
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,599
unhappy if the doctor didn't tell you

1621
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,960
where it came from or maybe the doctor

1622
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,599
did that's why you're here but either

1623
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,920

1628
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,839
somebody getting a lot of blood work

1629
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,240
if you're somebody

1630
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:12,720
that's struggling with a lot of problems

1631
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,280
if you're somebody that's having bone

1632
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,680
problems you're losing your skeleton

1633
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,440

1634
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,000
your skeletal system

1635
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,000
renato banana says the amount of times

1636
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
they drew blood from my mom within the

1637
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,960
six months she underwent cancer

1638
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,799
treatments was absolutely insane

1639
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,640
they do it

1640
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,559
not the doctor doesn't do it on purpose

1641
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,040
i think the system is rigged to do it

1642
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,520
purposely that's what i believe

1643
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,160
but that's my opinion

1644
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,599
you know everybody has their own opinion

1645
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,200
i'm pretty sure they're trying to kill

1646
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,119
people with the blood with the broken

1647
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,720

1650
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,160

01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,839

01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,160
important to know right there

every single day we're so acidic we're

1656
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:08,559
pissing out a piece of ourselves we're

1657
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,000
pissing out our skull

01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,000
we're pissing out of our skull

1659
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,880
what that means is when you go to

1660
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,319
bathroom in the morning when you're

1661
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,400

1700
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,079

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,559
before on the planet over and over again

1702
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,640
