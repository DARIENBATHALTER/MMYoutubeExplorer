[83.60 - 87.60] all the different nerves okay cranial
[85.68 - 89.12] nerves and people are dealing with that
[87.60 - 90.96] left and right out there

[129.84 - 133.36] right
[130.96 - 134.56] and so i'm always like immune system
[133.36 - 136.88] you've got to have
[134.56 - 138.40] a strong immune system it's critical
[136.88 - 140.00] because we're already up against so much
[138.40 - 141.36] you guys are already up against
[140.00 - 144.32] all the different stuff the thyroid
[141.36 - 146.48] conditions everybody
[144.32 - 147.92] is going to have a thyroid condition
[146.48 - 150.16] eventually
[147.92 - 151.92] everybody is going to have a thyroid
[150.16 - 154.24] condition hashimoto's thyroiditis
[151.92 - 154.88] hypothyroidism hyperthyroidism graves
[154.24 - 157.60] thyroid
[154.88 - 159.60] nodules cysts tumors everybody's going
[157.60 - 161.52] to have a thyroid condition
[159.60 - 163.60] everybody's going to also have a cranial
[161.52 - 164.08] nerve problem one way or another tingles
[163.60 - 166.88] numbness
[164.08 - 167.92] aches and pains ticks spasms blurry
[166.88 - 170.96] vision
[167.92 - 173.76] uh you know floaters in the eyes
[170.96 - 175.12] tinnitus ringing the ears dizziness all
[173.76 - 179.04] of it
[175.12 - 180.32] and and we're also coming up on bad
[179.04 - 184.40] flues
[180.32 - 186.40] bad plagues bad flus right
[184.40 - 188.16] and i've always been ahead of the curve
[186.40 - 189.84] and something if you're new to medical
[188.16 - 192.00] media information medical medium
[189.84 - 195.68] information is so advanced
[192.00 - 197.20] it leads the way in natural medicine
[195.68 - 198.80] alternative medicine conventional
[197.20 - 200.64] medicine when it comes down to chronic
[198.80 - 202.56] illness so it leads the way
[200.64 - 204.80] it's the most advanced information it's
[202.56 - 206.56] always ahead of everybody else
[204.80 - 208.40] like the blood draw information the
[206.56 - 211.68] blood testing information that
[208.40 - 213.04] that i delivered and
[211.68 - 214.48] so many other things about how
[213.04 - 216.24] epstein-barr causes all the different
[214.48 - 217.04] conditions out there how it's one of the
[216.24 - 218.88] viruses
[217.04 - 221.12] how there's more than one variety of
[218.88 - 222.40] epstein-barr and how it reactivates and
[221.12 - 224.40] causes all these symptoms
[222.40 - 226.24] no one knew this so medical medium
[224.40 - 229.84] information if you're brand new here
[226.24 - 232.00] is leading the way it's leading the way
[229.84 - 233.52] for all the naturopathic doctors
[232.00 - 236.00] functional medicine doctors
[233.52 - 237.84] chiropractors who play natural medicine
[236.00 - 238.32] all of it it's leading the way for all
[237.84 - 240.56] of them
[238.32 - 242.48] and they use pieces of it they're all
[240.56 - 244.40] using pieces of it now
[242.48 - 247.84] and that's what's happening so i want to
[244.40 - 250.96] make sure still leading the way
[247.84 - 252.96] and it's important that we have
[250.96 - 254.16] that information so we can protect
[252.96 - 257.04] ourselves
[254.16 - 258.72] so we're talking about flu protocols
[257.04 - 259.52] we're talking about immune system
[258.72 - 260.96] building
[259.52 - 262.72] we're gonna use zinc shock therapy
[260.96 - 265.28] vitamin c shock therapy we need
[262.72 - 268.88] time t do a couple of other things too
[265.28 - 271.44] so i'm looking forward to it um
[268.88 - 272.80] gianna i just made the banana garlic
[271.44 - 275.12] honey nori rolls
[272.80 - 275.84] that you posted on tick tock so so good
[275.12 - 277.60] aren't they
[275.84 - 279.60] that's an incredible immune system
[277.60 - 281.28] builder right there you've got the raw
[279.60 - 282.64] honey in there and i'm gonna make that a
[281.28 - 283.20] little bit so right on tick tock
[282.64 - 286.24] incredible
[283.20 - 288.08] you got the raw honey you got the
[286.24 - 289.36] garlic in there you got the banana and
[288.08 - 291.20] you've got the glucose and i'm going to
[289.36 - 293.04] talk about why that works
[291.20 - 294.56] so you guys we're in the immune system
[293.04 - 295.68] we're in there now we're talking about
[294.56 - 297.68] it here we are so we got some
[295.68 - 299.76] supplements in front of us
[297.68 - 300.80] these are the ones i use my friends
[299.76 - 302.80] family me
[300.80 - 304.72] for immune system protection immune
[302.80 - 306.72] system buildings so let's hit the zinc
[304.72 - 309.68] right off the running
[306.72 - 311.68] sinks something everybody's deficient in
[309.68 - 314.72] i talk about it all the time
[311.68 - 315.60] so stuff falling out of the sky and i
[314.72 - 316.88] say stuff
[315.60 - 318.88] falling out of the sky like the
[316.88 - 320.96] chemtrail stuff right
[318.88 - 322.24] all that different pollution everything
[320.96 - 324.32] that's falling out of the sky
[322.24 - 326.24] ddt is still floating around in the
[324.32 - 327.76] atmosphere all the time
[326.24 - 329.68] it blows around from continent to
[327.76 - 331.52] continent right we got all the stuff
[329.68 - 332.48] just blowing around and when it lands in
[331.52 - 334.64] your soil
[332.48 - 335.68] when it lands in the soil we grow our
[334.64 - 339.36] food in
[335.68 - 340.24] it depletes it so toxic heavy metals and
[339.36 - 343.52] other
[340.24 - 344.32] chemicals coming out of the sky land in
[343.52 - 347.28] the soil
[344.32 - 348.64] every single day every single night and
[347.28 - 352.32] they then the rain
[348.64 - 355.44] brings them into the soil into the earth
[352.32 - 357.04] and it depletes the earth of zinc it's
[355.44 - 359.20] one of the reasons why we don't have
[357.04 - 359.84] zinc anymore in our soils our foods
[359.20 - 362.96] don't have
[359.84 - 363.76] zinc and if i hear one more time one
[362.96 - 367.04] more time
[363.76 - 370.40] just eat some oysters or do some oyster
[367.04 - 370.80] do some an oyster supplement i mean i
[370.40 - 374.00] mean
[370.80 - 375.36] honestly it it's it's like i can do
[374.00 - 377.36] everything i can
[375.36 - 378.48] but i don't know what more i can do i
[377.36 - 380.32] mean i just
[378.48 - 381.76] don't you know so let's try that now
[380.32 - 383.60] right don't you don't want to try that
[381.76 - 386.56] it's terrible
[383.60 - 388.24] so when you're doing oyster products
[386.56 - 390.24] you're just getting more mercury
[388.24 - 392.32] one of the very things that's depleting
[390.24 - 394.00] the soils of zinc
[392.32 - 395.52] so let's just try let's try to eat some
[394.00 - 399.12] oysters and just so you know
[395.52 - 402.48] oysters aren't high in zinc they just
[399.12 - 404.32] show zinc they show it as one of its
[402.48 - 405.84] trace minerals but they're not high in
[404.32 - 407.76] zinc it's just that everything is so
[405.84 - 409.20] depleted in zinc
[407.76 - 412.16] and this is important to know because
[409.20 - 415.28] this is where everybody fools everybody
[412.16 - 418.08] everything is so depleted in zinc
[415.28 - 419.28] that the tiny tiny bit of zinc in a
[418.08 - 422.72] pumpkin seed
[419.28 - 423.68] that shows up or in an oyster that shows
[422.72 - 425.68] up make us go hey
[423.68 - 428.24] no let's sink oh my god we just found
[425.68 - 429.12] zinc just found zinc hey there's zinc
[428.24 - 431.04] and oysters
[429.12 - 432.96] eat a bunch of oysters if you want your
[431.04 - 435.44] zinc
[432.96 - 438.00] meanwhile every single fruit and
[435.44 - 439.92] vegetable is supposed to show even more
[438.00 - 444.00] zinc than an oyster does but it doesn't
[439.92 - 447.12] because the earth is depleted right
[444.00 - 449.52] the earth is depleted the soils and
[447.12 - 451.76] pumpkin seeds happen to have a little
[449.52 - 454.40] bit of zinc in it but you can eat yours
[451.76 - 456.00] you can eat pumpkin seeds until you
[454.40 - 457.68] can't eat them anymore and you're not
[456.00 - 460.08] going to get enough zinc for the immune
[457.68 - 462.72] system but that's the illusion
[460.08 - 464.16] that's happening out there pumpkin seeds
[462.72 - 466.08] are good for you i'm not saying pumpkin
[464.16 - 467.92] seeds aren't good for you
[466.08 - 469.68] but it's not going to be enough it's
[467.92 - 471.68] like okay i'm coming down with the worst
[469.68 - 473.36] flu of my life let me eat a bag of
[471.68 - 475.76] pumpkin seeds
[473.36 - 476.48] i mean is that stupid i mean really you

[554.72 - 558.56] guys i just want to know does that make

[558.56 - 562.48] chris good to see you pumpkin seeds
[560.56 - 565.12] never got anyone better and chris
[562.48 - 566.88] it's so true it's so true mary said i
[565.12 - 568.96] also wonder where does the zinc and the
[566.88 - 570.64] supplements then come from trace mineral
[568.96 - 573.28] zinc liquid zinc sulfate
[570.64 - 574.48] from the earth but you can't it's not in
[573.28 - 576.56] your soil
[574.48 - 578.80] where your crops are growing it's not in
[576.56 - 579.28] the soil your crops only have a little
[578.80 - 582.72] root
[579.28 - 585.52] system a little root system in the dirt
[582.72 - 587.44] so you got your little top soil right
[585.52 - 588.64] and you got something growing out of
[587.44 - 590.56] your topsoil
[588.64 - 593.04] okay you've got a little root system
[590.56 - 596.08] down in here and all that soil there
[593.04 - 598.16] the little root system is in okay that's
[596.08 - 599.28] your turnip is in or anything is in that
[598.16 - 603.84] root system
[599.28 - 606.56] the zinc's not there it's not
[603.84 - 608.88] but but that's this is how ridiculous
[606.56 - 612.08] alternative medicine is
[608.88 - 614.96] or conventional medicine too is okay
[612.08 - 616.72] let me eat a box of oysters i better
[614.96 - 619.20] call my oyster guy
[616.72 - 620.96] let me do that right let me quit like my
[619.20 - 622.96] oyster connection
[620.96 - 624.88] how stupid or a supplement now that's
[622.96 - 627.84] got oyster in it i mean can we be
[624.88 - 627.84] any crazier
[629.68 - 636.08] so why are you announcing amazon f4
[632.88 - 637.52] tick-tock won't notify me when you're
[636.08 - 640.56] live
[637.52 - 642.00] so then tick-tock okay you guys so let's
[640.56 - 643.68] get into it on supplements that are
[642.00 - 645.20] critical zinc is one of those critical
[643.68 - 648.48] supplements right there
[645.20 - 651.44] okay that's the one that isn't hard
[648.48 - 652.64] on the stomach like other zincs doesn't
[651.44 - 655.44] have the citric acid
[652.64 - 655.92] the alcohol the preservatives it's not a
[655.44 - 658.16] hard
[655.92 - 659.28] zinc and that's that's the difference
[658.16 - 661.12] there's so many people are like why i
[659.28 - 664.00] had sink it made me so sick
[661.12 - 664.40] well yeah i tried all the zinc out there
[664.00 - 667.52] i
[664.40 - 668.80] i tried one it was so toxic out there it
[667.52 - 671.36] was from a
[668.80 - 673.68] reputable company out there and i
[671.36 - 674.00] grabbed it it was the liquid stuff i
[673.68 - 676.24] looked
[674.00 - 677.92] at i said yeah i do see garbage in here
[676.24 - 678.88] but let me just everybody says this is
[677.92 - 680.48] the best one
[678.88 - 682.08] let me take a look i took the cap off
[680.48 - 684.16] boom sent it down and i
[682.08 - 685.84] literally thought i was gonna vomit my
[684.16 - 688.96] guts out on the ground
[685.84 - 690.56] i said this is poison poison and so
[688.96 - 692.40] that's the thing out there there's bad

[740.40 - 743.44] on we're talking about a building the
[742.16 - 744.80] immune system why it's important so

[744.80 - 748.08] basophils monocytes neutrophils
[747.12 - 751.84] lymphocytes
[748.08 - 754.64] killer cells white blood count cbc

[754.64 - 759.92] your large white blood cells
[756.88 - 762.00] okay neutrophils all part of the
[759.92 - 764.00] right basophils neutrophils monocytes
[762.00 - 765.44] lymphocytes
[764.00 - 767.28] all these different aspects of our
[765.44 - 769.76] immune system
[767.28 - 771.68] we need things to support it because
[769.76 - 772.00] those those parts of our immune system
[771.68 - 775.12] are
[772.00 - 776.80] under attack when we get invaders enter
[775.12 - 779.60] our lives
[776.80 - 780.96] so zinc shock therapy is is really a
[779.60 - 783.04] great
[780.96 - 784.48] is really a great way to stave off
[783.04 - 785.28] something people feel like they're

[836.40 - 840.00] the chronically ill
[837.20 - 842.40] and for for the good of humankind when

[845.52 - 850.48] pages it's a big book anyway
[848.80 - 852.56] zing shot therapies in the book
[850.48 - 854.16] slingshot therapy is two dropper fulls
[852.56 - 856.56] of zinc

[868.96 - 872.00] you know you do what whatever your
[870.16 - 875.52] doctor tells you to do but
[872.00 - 879.20] you do six tiny drops if you want every
[875.52 - 882.88] three hours you can do one drop or full
[879.20 - 885.92] there every three hours
[882.88 - 889.68] but it's a great technique to shut
[885.92 - 892.96] the crap down it's a great technique
[889.68 - 894.72] to shut that down it is got sore
[892.96 - 896.32] throat coming on

[927.52 - 933.60] zinc is is the one of the founding
[930.80 - 935.44] fathers one of the foundation pieces of
[933.60 - 937.52] our immune system right there
[935.44 - 939.20] important to know so this is the

[957.76 - 960.64] goldenseal
[961.04 - 965.36] that's a powerhouse all on its own for
[963.36 - 969.68] the immune system
[965.36 - 973.28] okay so pathogens don't like goldenseal
[969.68 - 975.76] bugs don't like goldenseal even mrsa
[973.28 - 978.88] doesn't like goldenseal right
[975.76 - 984.40] sharptococcus doesn't like goldenseal
[978.88 - 988.00] chronic sinusitis bacterial vaginosis
[984.40 - 990.24] utis bladder issues bladder infections
[988.00 - 993.04] kidney infections
[990.24 - 993.68] lung infections throat infection sore
[993.04 - 996.72] throat
[993.68 - 998.08] strep throat or any kind of sore throat
[996.72 - 1000.56] the sore throat in the corner of your
[998.08 - 1002.08] throat you guys ever get the sore throat
[1000.56 - 1003.84] in the corner
[1002.08 - 1005.68] i go oh i got a sore throat coming on
[1003.84 - 1006.56] it's in the corner but yet i don't have
[1005.68 - 1009.04] a cold
[1006.56 - 1010.56] but yet i don't have a flu there are no
[1009.04 - 1012.80] colds by the way
[1010.56 - 1014.08] cold's just colds don't exist on the
[1012.80 - 1016.16] planet
[1014.08 - 1018.56] any time someone starts coming down with
[1016.16 - 1021.60] something it's the flu
[1018.56 - 1024.16] or flu family virus is like the plague
[1021.60 - 1026.40] but the cold has been the cold is gone
[1024.16 - 1028.32] when someone just gets a mild rendition
[1026.40 - 1029.84] of a cold
[1028.32 - 1031.84] that was just a mild rendition of the
[1029.84 - 1034.32] flu the cold just
[1031.84 - 1035.12] died off that whole you know i caught a
[1034.32 - 1037.68] cold
[1035.12 - 1040.16] you didn't catch a cold you caught a flu
[1037.68 - 1042.64] you just had a mild version of it or
[1040.16 - 1044.88] you were able to get through it fast
[1042.64 - 1047.36] someone else caught the same cold
[1044.88 - 1049.52] they're coughing their guts out they now
[1047.36 - 1050.72] got bronchitis they're on antibiotics
[1049.52 - 1054.40] they're seeing the doctor
[1050.72 - 1054.40] they caught the same cold you caught
[1054.56 - 1058.72] you just your immune system handled it a
[1056.72 - 1060.72] little better
[1058.72 - 1063.84] yeah you might not have been at that
[1060.72 - 1065.20] place where your cycle wasn't coming on
[1063.84 - 1067.44] and it might have been in between your
[1065.20 - 1067.92] cycle coming on and ovulation coming on
[1067.44 - 1070.48] and then
[1067.92 - 1073.12] it didn't turn into a bad flu it turned
[1070.48 - 1076.24] into a real mild flu
[1073.12 - 1077.36] right important enough that's how it
[1076.24 - 1079.36] works
[1077.36 - 1080.80] but someone else caught it's cold too in
[1079.36 - 1082.56] the group of people so the group of
[1080.80 - 1084.48] friends someone else caught that cold
[1082.56 - 1086.48] well that wasn't no cold because someone
[1084.48 - 1087.20] else is literally bedridden with 103
[1086.48 - 1088.88] temperature
[1087.20 - 1091.28] they're on the couch to coughing their
[1088.88 - 1093.76] guts out
[1091.28 - 1094.88] and they caught the same cold there's no
[1093.76 - 1098.64] colds
[1094.88 - 1101.04] anywhere anymore cold the cold
[1098.64 - 1102.96] virus the little rhinoviruses and the
[1101.04 - 1105.76] little cold viruses
[1102.96 - 1106.56] those have come and gone in our history
[1105.76 - 1109.68] gone
[1106.56 - 1111.28] gone they're not around no more
[1109.68 - 1112.96] you get a little something well i got a
[1111.28 - 1114.64] little sinus congestion i'm starting to
[1112.96 - 1117.84] come down with something that's the flu
[1114.64 - 1117.84] you might have a mild one
[1118.32 - 1122.24] but that's the flu it's important to
[1120.24 - 1124.16] know how things work
[1122.24 - 1125.60] the goldenseal is critical for all that
[1124.16 - 1128.56] if you guys want to know what this is
[1125.60 - 1130.24] of emergency stuff via the victor i am
[1128.56 - 1132.32] mary ergy
[1130.24 - 1133.44] dot com important to know so it's
[1132.32 - 1136.24] memorgy.com
[1133.44 - 1137.92] that's the stuff that i use if i want a
[1136.24 - 1139.36] golden seal it's got to be one with the
[1137.92 - 1140.64] quality it's got to be the one i know i
[1139.36 - 1142.40] can trust it's gonna be the one i know
[1140.64 - 1145.28] that can knock something out in my
[1142.40 - 1147.04] system and not something else it has to
[1145.28 - 1149.76] be a product that doesn't have that
[1147.04 - 1150.64] hidden that hidden five six seven eight
[1149.76 - 1154.88] percent of
[1150.64 - 1156.40] hidden mystery ingredients that the
[1154.88 - 1157.20] manufacturers all put in everybody's
[1156.40 - 1160.32] supplements
[1157.20 - 1162.64] vimergy doesn't allow that
[1160.32 - 1164.00] so yeah so so goldenseal is important so
[1162.64 - 1166.08] i love covering the cold
[1164.00 - 1167.84] information but i hear people like i
[1166.08 - 1171.28] think i got a cold now
[1167.84 - 1173.20] no and another thing too is allergies
[1171.28 - 1176.24] get confused
[1173.20 - 1177.76] i love when that happens someone's
[1176.24 - 1179.84] coughing
[1177.76 - 1182.24] they got the runny nose they got the
[1179.84 - 1185.76] sinuses and it's like
[1182.24 - 1188.88] you know it's like it's my allergies
[1185.76 - 1190.72] it's not your allergies
[1188.88 - 1192.48] you know yeah well it's allergy time i
[1190.72 - 1195.52] think i'm dealing with an allergy
[1192.48 - 1196.96] you got the flu you've got you're
[1195.52 - 1199.36] coughing
[1196.96 - 1201.76] you're coughing your lungs out you've
[1199.36 - 1204.48] got the sinuses running you've got the
[1201.76 - 1206.00] you've got the low-grade fever you got
[1204.48 - 1208.24] the flu you don't have you
[1206.00 - 1209.76] don't have allergies that's with that
[1208.24 - 1210.96] maybe you do have allergies but that's
[1209.76 - 1213.68] not an allergy
[1210.96 - 1215.36] you can get the flu every month people
[1213.68 - 1217.12] get it every month their immune system's
[1215.36 - 1219.44] so low you guys they get the flu every
[1217.12 - 1222.96] month they get the flu every seven weeks
[1219.44 - 1224.00] eight weeks and then and then it comes
[1222.96 - 1226.32] down to
[1224.00 - 1228.32] it comes down to yeah getting the flu
[1226.32 - 1229.20] every because the flu is out every six
[1228.32 - 1232.40] weeks
[1229.20 - 1234.40] there's a new flu every six weeks if it
[1232.40 - 1237.36] isn't just the plague that's cycling

[1382.16 - 1385.68] a stomach flu going around
[1383.44 - 1387.20] there's also another flu going around
[1385.68 - 1390.32] and then the plagues going around
[1387.20 - 1392.96] three things going around right now
[1390.32 - 1394.72] so anyway gold and seal is critical how
[1392.96 - 1397.04] do i know
[1394.72 - 1398.88] two things are going around i get the
[1397.04 - 1400.56] calls from
[1398.88 - 1403.20] powerful people in the world and family
[1400.56 - 1406.40] members what do i do
[1403.20 - 1407.44] what do i do so get on your vimorji get
[1406.40 - 1410.16] on your vimorji
[1407.44 - 1412.08] what what i picked this stuff up at the
[1410.16 - 1415.12] health food store
[1412.08 - 1416.96] it's got alcohol in it
[1415.12 - 1418.88] it's got citric acid in it doesn't even
[1416.96 - 1420.64] have the right amount of
[1418.88 - 1422.40] gold seal the quality goldenseal is
[1420.64 - 1424.32] terrible all this important so
[1422.40 - 1428.32] goldenseal what i love about goldenseal
[1424.32 - 1431.52] is there's something inside of you
[1428.32 - 1433.12] that tells you your healing
[1431.52 - 1434.96] when you start taking gold the right
[1433.12 - 1438.24] kind of goldenseal you can
[1434.96 - 1440.16] feel it kathy i wish more people would
[1438.24 - 1441.52] listen to me when i tell them about your
[1440.16 - 1443.60] protocols i have
[1441.52 - 1444.72] healed so much because of you it's just
[1443.60 - 1447.36] it's spiritual
[1444.72 - 1448.72] discrimination is all it is kathy the
[1447.36 - 1450.08] reason why i don't listen to spiritual
[1448.72 - 1453.44] discrimination
[1450.08 - 1455.84] it's a lot of people
[1453.44 - 1458.16] don't realize that first of all science
[1455.84 - 1461.20] and research
[1458.16 - 1462.48] the ball it just dropped the ball they
[1461.20 - 1463.20] think that it's going to be there to
[1462.48 - 1464.40] catch you
[1463.20 - 1473.84] they do they think it's going to be
[1464.40 - 1473.84] there to catch you
[1474.08 - 1478.08] science science of research are you
[1477.12 - 1481.04] there
[1478.08 - 1483.60] because when i get sick someday yale
[1481.04 - 1486.80] universe yale and harvard
[1483.60 - 1488.56] and all the dartmouth all of them are
[1486.80 - 1489.68] gay and all the scientists are going to
[1488.56 - 1492.00] catch me
[1489.68 - 1494.32] when i get sick with my cranial nerve
[1492.00 - 1495.92] problems and my migraines and my fatigue
[1494.32 - 1497.68] and my aches and pains my trigeminal
[1495.92 - 1500.00] neuralgia and my sciatic pain

[1500.00 - 1505.84] okay you ready
[1501.44 - 1505.84] okay okay catch me you're there
[1510.64 - 1517.76] they're not gonna catch you cold and flu
[1514.08 - 1517.76] protocol inclines the heal by the way
[1517.92 - 1521.52] check it out all right i got to take
[1519.84 - 1524.96] things serious here
[1521.52 - 1526.56] uh and it is serious in a sophie i
[1524.96 - 1529.76] didn't have a flu
[1526.56 - 1531.84] even once since i started following mm
[1529.76 - 1533.84] so really amazing you know it's it's
[1531.84 - 1535.52] i've heard that a lot
[1533.84 - 1537.52] and yeah there's a lot of them going
[1535.52 - 1539.36] around and you could be you know
[1537.52 - 1541.28] at a little point where you could get
[1539.36 - 1542.96] something absolutely there's that many
[1541.28 - 1544.72] things going around and you know that
[1542.96 - 1546.64] at least you'll have better chances with
[1544.72 - 1550.08] mm stuff
[1546.64 - 1552.16] for sure so there's something about gold
[1550.08 - 1554.96] and seal the right kind like when i take
[1552.16 - 1558.80] the vimergy golden seal right
[1554.96 - 1561.20] something just hits you
[1558.80 - 1562.56] that your body's kicking in the gear to
[1561.20 - 1566.48] heal
[1562.56 - 1567.76] you've got to remember that too right
[1566.48 - 1568.96] always ask your doctor what's right for
[1567.76 - 1570.40] you take what your doctor wants you to
[1568.96 - 1571.20] take i'm just saying that when i have a
[1570.40 - 1575.44] family member
[1571.20 - 1578.88] take this i always ask them you feel it
[1575.44 - 1580.00] you feel it kicking in you feel that
[1578.88 - 1582.24] right
[1580.00 - 1583.60] that's your body registering to this
[1582.24 - 1587.04] right here
[1583.60 - 1589.92] because this is so potent and strong
[1587.04 - 1590.72] and so right and and the quality is so
[1589.92 - 1592.40] good
[1590.72 - 1594.16] that the right kind of golden seal
[1592.40 - 1597.20] because golden seal in itself
[1594.16 - 1601.76] is magical magical herb
[1597.20 - 1603.76] magical root magical herb and
[1601.76 - 1606.16] and when you when it starts entering the
[1603.76 - 1606.16] body
[1606.88 - 1610.40] so angela says isn't golden seal one of
[1608.96 - 1611.36] the supplements like licorice you
[1610.40 - 1614.08] shouldn't
[1611.36 - 1615.92] take longer than two weeks yeah i mean
[1614.08 - 1620.16] here's the thing right
[1615.92 - 1623.04] with goldenseal it's like an antibiotic
[1620.16 - 1624.00] you said it's a natural antibiotic okay
[1623.04 - 1625.60] and
[1624.00 - 1626.72] if you have to be on it longer than two
[1625.60 - 1628.00] weeks it's still gonna do what it's
[1626.72 - 1630.00] gonna do for you
[1628.00 - 1631.68] but i talk about it in cleansing heal
[1630.00 - 1633.68] that it's good to take a break sometimes
[1631.68 - 1636.56] two weeks on two weeks off
[1633.68 - 1639.68] but i've taken goldenseal just long term
[1636.56 - 1641.36] to keep my immune system strong
[1639.68 - 1643.20] i've recommended family members be on
[1641.36 - 1645.84] gold gold and seal
[1643.20 - 1647.44] six weeks solid without taking a break
[1645.84 - 1649.68] i've recommended
[1647.44 - 1651.60] people i've known friends to be on gold
[1649.68 - 1653.04] seal for a three-month stint
[1651.60 - 1655.20] and then take a break and then go back
[1653.04 - 1656.72] on it for three months but yes
[1655.20 - 1658.24] it's a little rule of thumb take little
[1656.72 - 1662.40] breaks i do the two week
[1658.24 - 1662.40] on two week off and cleanse the heel
[1664.32 - 1667.60] so goldenseal is just something really
[1666.16 - 1672.16] special
[1667.60 - 1676.08] it's one of those herbs roots herb root
[1672.16 - 1678.40] that talks
[1676.08 - 1679.60] communicates to the immune system to the
[1678.40 - 1681.28] body
[1679.60 - 1684.88] and you can feel it when you're taking
[1681.28 - 1688.32] it when that sore throat's coming on
[1684.88 - 1692.00] and you're like i got to do something
[1688.32 - 1693.44] and you take that golden seal you know
[1692.00 - 1697.04] you take that golden seal got a little
[1693.44 - 1698.48] shot glass here
[1697.04 - 1700.48] i just put three dropper holes of that
[1698.48 - 1703.04] golden seal in this this little shot
[1700.48 - 1703.04] glass right
[1703.44 - 1707.12] and you feel something coming on or you

[1714.72 - 1719.20] wants to no one likes dr

[1720.80 - 1726.00] hate dr nesbit
[1722.40 - 1728.24] i just felt i felt so bad for dr nez but
[1726.00 - 1730.08] is dr des been in today in surgery today

[1730.08 - 1733.60] him out of surgery
[1731.60 - 1735.52] i'm pretty sure we might be able to get
[1733.60 - 1738.08] him out in the middle of the operation
[1735.52 - 1739.60] while the patient's on the table still
[1738.08 - 1741.60] we might be able to get them out for a
[1739.60 - 1744.24] while while the patient's on the table
[1741.60 - 1744.64] they'll just keep the patient under it's
[1744.24 - 1746.88] okay
[1744.64 - 1749.04] the nurses will be be around the patient
[1746.88 - 1750.88] when dr nesbit comes in
[1749.04 - 1753.84] with the golden seal you feel the golden
[1750.88 - 1757.44] seal kick it
[1753.84 - 1757.44] no one likes dr nesbitt
[1759.28 - 1762.72] truth is everybody loves dr nesbitt they

[1769.20 - 1773.52] just took it
[1771.36 - 1774.88] what happens is golden seal has a
[1773.52 - 1777.36] communication
[1774.88 - 1779.44] ability like it's an herb root ancient
[1777.36 - 1780.56] herb root that's connected to our immune

[2095.76 - 2098.24] hello
[2099.04 - 2103.92] so we got a stomach right here
[2102.56 - 2106.40] one of the reasons why everybody has
[2103.92 - 2108.08] digestive problems and they also have
[2106.40 - 2110.40] bad bacteria in their gut is because
[2108.08 - 2112.40] their stomach glands have been burnt out
[2110.40 - 2114.16] their low their hydrochloric acid is low
[2112.40 - 2116.80] to nil to none
[2114.16 - 2118.72] okay virtually none non-existent and
[2116.80 - 2121.84] that's what happens when that happens
[2118.72 - 2123.52] bad bacteria can prosper especially for
[2121.84 - 2125.84] feeding that bad bacteria bad
[2123.52 - 2128.08] foods right so then the bad bacteria
[2125.84 - 2128.72] prospers inside the gut each pylori
[2128.08 - 2132.24] rises
[2128.72 - 2132.96] e coli arises rises and streptococcus
[2132.24 - 2136.00] rises
[2132.96 - 2139.44] right there apple then good to see you
[2136.00 - 2142.72] everything everything rises that's bad
[2139.44 - 2145.84] bad and it rises okay
[2142.72 - 2147.60] what i love about even goldenseal
[2145.84 - 2150.24] is good for that too but what i love
[2147.60 - 2153.04] about like the lemon balm
[2150.24 - 2153.04] that's the nettle
[2153.28 - 2160.64] what i love about the lemon balm is
[2156.64 - 2162.88] it's antibacterial antibacterial
[2160.64 - 2165.36] love it but it does something else
[2162.88 - 2167.68] because the gut gets inflamed from all
[2165.36 - 2168.96] the bad bacteria the inflammation
[2167.68 - 2171.52] bothers the nerves
[2168.96 - 2172.40] and so all the nerves going into the gut
[2171.52 - 2174.08] gets sensitive
[2172.40 - 2176.96] and then everybody has all these
[2174.08 - 2178.48] neurological issues in their gut
[2176.96 - 2180.72] and they feel it and they're having
[2178.48 - 2181.92] problems in their gut intestinal tract
[2180.72 - 2183.68] different digestive issues and
[2181.92 - 2184.08] everything else michelle l good to see
[2183.68 - 2186.40] you
[2184.08 - 2188.08] they have all these problems and that's
[2186.40 - 2190.64] what i love about lemon balm
[2188.08 - 2192.64] it's an anti-spasmodic for those nerves
[2190.64 - 2194.32] it calms down the nerves inside the gut
[2192.64 - 2197.60] but it's antibacterial too
[2194.32 - 2200.16] it's a great gentle immune builder
[2197.60 - 2201.52] something can be taken every day every
[2200.16 - 2203.76] single day
[2201.52 - 2205.28] you can take the lemon balm every day
[2203.76 - 2207.44] helping to keep your immune system
[2205.28 - 2208.96] strong so even stuff that's inside of
[2207.44 - 2209.76] you that's growing that shouldn't be
[2208.96 - 2212.88] there
[2209.76 - 2216.00] starts to grow starts to grow
[2212.88 - 2217.36] elizabeth elizabeth edwards says yep me
[2216.00 - 2220.24] i get stabbing pains you get the
[2217.36 - 2222.00] stabbing gut pains right
[2220.24 - 2223.68] little gas bubble moving through and it
[2222.00 - 2226.80] hurts like heck
[2223.68 - 2229.36] because it's inflamed in there and
[2226.80 - 2229.84] so lemon balm is something that i use
[2229.36 - 2231.44] for
[2229.84 - 2232.88] my friends and family when they have any
[2231.44 - 2233.52] kind of issues like this so that's
[2232.88 - 2235.12] important
[2233.52 - 2236.48] guys anybody coming on that's the
[2235.12 - 2237.28] vimorgy if you don't want to know the

[2723.52 - 2726.00] that medical media information is never
[2725.04 - 2728.08] proven wrong ever
[2726.00 - 2730.08] never has it's consistent and it's never
[2728.08 - 2732.56] proven wrong it's only proven right
[2730.08 - 2734.24] now all the supplement companies have
[2732.56 - 2736.00] taken medical medium info
[2734.24 - 2738.24] and they're saying you can't build
[2736.00 - 2740.64] collagen by eating collagen anymore
[2738.24 - 2742.24] so you need all these other things and
[2740.64 - 2743.76] they're taking little pieces of medical
[2742.24 - 2744.96] medium information and they're putting
[2743.76 - 2747.36] it in a product and they're saying this
[2744.96 - 2749.68] is how you build collagen
[2747.36 - 2750.80] mm info if you're new here leads the way
[2749.68 - 2752.16] in natural medicine
[2750.80 - 2755.12] for years and years and years actually
[2752.16 - 2757.52] for decades now fact
[2755.12 - 2759.12] so important to know why am i even
[2757.52 - 2761.92] talking about any of this
[2759.12 - 2764.56] metal leaf is a great supporter of that
[2761.92 - 2764.56] collagen
[2765.12 - 2768.32] how come they don't put multiple herbs
[2767.76 - 2772.64] in one
[2768.32 - 2772.64] bottle only ah
[2773.12 - 2777.60] very important question right there how
[2775.76 - 2780.80] come they don't
[2777.60 - 2781.68] because that's how they rip you off out
[2780.80 - 2784.24] there
[2781.68 - 2786.32] well very important question i talk
[2784.24 - 2789.68] about that and cleanse the heal
[2786.32 - 2792.56] that's how they rip you off
[2789.68 - 2793.28] they put lots of different herbs in one
[2792.56 - 2796.96] bottle
[2793.28 - 2800.64] so you can't get better if you buy
[2796.96 - 2802.80] an immune system builder herbal formula
[2800.64 - 2805.28] you just got ripped off seven ways to
[2802.80 - 2808.16] sunday
[2805.28 - 2810.64] you just got ripped off seven ways to
[2808.16 - 2810.64] sunday
[2811.12 - 2818.40] fact because every one of those bottles
[2814.56 - 2821.76] they use a spidgeon of a little smidgen
[2818.40 - 2825.92] a little spickle a little tiny smidgen
[2821.76 - 2828.64] of each herb and a poor quality one
[2825.92 - 2831.20] because that's how they make their money
[2828.64 - 2833.52] that's how they make their money
[2831.20 - 2833.52] okay
[2840.08 - 2845.84] yeah uh herbal world
[2843.44 - 2847.68] yeah herbal world manufacturers of all
[2845.84 - 2849.84] the herbal supplements that we all
[2847.68 - 2851.84] that we that we sell to all the small
[2849.84 - 2854.40] independent companies
[2851.84 - 2856.16] yep we're putting in a little tiny bit
[2854.40 - 2859.04] of each herb
[2856.16 - 2860.56] we're going to put adrenal formula on
[2859.04 - 2862.56] there and then we're going to put
[2860.56 - 2863.76] immune formula on another one and then
[2862.56 - 2866.56] we're going to put
[2863.76 - 2867.28] a brain formula in another one and we're
[2866.56 - 2870.48] going to throw
[2867.28 - 2871.36] a little tiny speck of each herb in that
[2870.48 - 2874.08] formula
[2871.36 - 2876.24] so that they can't get better but yet it
[2874.08 - 2877.28] costs us nothing to do it that way
[2876.24 - 2879.20] and we're gonna make sure there's
[2877.28 - 2880.48] alcohol in there or citric acid and
[2879.20 - 2881.60] everything else in there and natural
[2880.48 - 2884.84] flavors
[2881.60 - 2887.84] perfect yup that's what we do at herbal
[2884.84 - 2887.84] world
[2888.48 - 2891.68] and that's how it's done another reason
[2891.04 - 2893.60] why
[2891.68 - 2894.80] vimergy doesn't do that now here's the
[2893.60 - 2896.56] thing
[2894.80 - 2898.72] the reason why medical medium protocols
[2896.56 - 2900.80] get people better so when they really
[2898.72 - 2902.24] understand the protocol they're seeing
[2900.80 - 2905.68] that they're not getting an
[2902.24 - 2908.08] herbal remedy that has 20 herbs in it
[2905.68 - 2910.56] because you won't get better if there's
[2908.08 - 2913.60] 20 herbs in there
[2910.56 - 2915.60] if licorice is an antiviral you need a
[2913.60 - 2917.12] good amount of it in a good quality
[2915.60 - 2919.68] amount of it
[2917.12 - 2922.00] the right quality to make something
[2919.68 - 2924.24] happen
[2922.00 - 2925.44] you can't get better with a speck of
[2924.24 - 2927.76] cat's claw
[2925.44 - 2929.20] a speck in a supplement that's either a
[2927.76 - 2931.28] dried herb supplement
[2929.20 - 2932.56] or a bad liquid liquid one that has a
[2931.28 - 2935.28] whole bunch of different herbs
[2932.56 - 2937.04] you can't get better you guys this is
[2935.28 - 2939.52] priceless information
[2937.04 - 2940.40] this is information i taught for decades
[2939.52 - 2943.04] so people had to
[2940.40 - 2944.48] wait in line to talk to me so they
[2943.04 - 2945.28] because they were sick and they're like
[2944.48 - 2946.88] well i took
[2945.28 - 2949.60] uh this well you know but you're not
[2946.88 - 2949.60] getting better
[2950.00 - 2956.08] because knowing the right herb to take
[2954.24 - 2959.28] in the right quantity is how people
[2956.08 - 2962.32] get better that's how it's done you guys
[2959.28 - 2963.04] seriously chris chris you seem fine to
[2962.32 - 2964.72] me
[2963.04 - 2967.52] it is priceless you're right i mean
[2964.72 - 2970.32] seriously think about that
[2967.52 - 2971.68] and i do it for free i can charge for
[2970.32 - 2973.12] three thousand dollars for my immune
[2971.68 - 2975.60] system uh building
[2973.12 - 2977.04] course i can do an immune system
[2975.60 - 2979.84] building course you guys in charge
[2977.04 - 2979.84] three thousand dollars
[2980.72 - 2984.48] imposters are actually saying their
[2982.64 - 2986.00] medical medium and they're out there all
[2984.48 - 2987.44] through europe in the united states and
[2986.00 - 2988.88] they're charging people a thousand
[2987.44 - 2991.68] dollars to three thousand dollars just
[2988.88 - 2994.08] to talk to them for five minutes
[2991.68 - 2995.76] i can get a million people to to

[3361.52 - 3365.12] need to go back into immune system stuff
[3363.44 - 3366.72] right now
[3365.12 - 3368.56] all right we're talking about nettle
[3366.72 - 3369.68] nettle is nettle supports the immune
[3368.56 - 3372.00] system
[3369.68 - 3372.80] it has phytochemical compounds that your
[3372.00 - 3374.88] white count
[3372.80 - 3377.84] feeds off of so let's get some white cow
[3374.88 - 3377.84] now
[3378.64 - 3382.24] so it's a white blood cell you guys
[3381.12 - 3385.52] right there
[3382.24 - 3389.28] it's a white blood cell yeah
[3385.52 - 3390.00] and white blood cells love phytochemical
[3389.28 - 3393.92] compounds from
[3390.00 - 3398.24] herbs certain herbs and
[3393.92 - 3400.72] nettle leaf actually nourishes and feeds
[3398.24 - 3402.48] your white count it doesn't make it go
[3400.72 - 3404.96] berserk strong right
[3402.48 - 3406.08] like after infections but it keeps it
[3404.96 - 3407.60] strong
[3406.08 - 3409.28] so it helps to keep it strong that's why
[3407.60 - 3411.60] i love metal leaf i also love natalie
[3409.28 - 3413.36] because it is the building blocks
[3411.60 - 3414.96] it's one of the building blocks to not
[3413.36 - 3417.60] have wrinkled skin and
[3414.96 - 3419.12] not age so fast it's one of those
[3417.60 - 3423.44] building blocks
[3419.12 - 3423.44] i love it the white count right here
[3425.92 - 3429.76] all right i'm gonna make some tea let's
[3428.00 - 3433.84] do that so i'm gonna do some
[3429.76 - 3433.84] mushroom tea i got some chaga
[3437.12 - 3441.20] you guys don't mind if i micro dose
[3442.72 - 3451.04] well yeah i'm micro dosing here
[3447.20 - 3454.72] yeah dude micro dosing
[3451.04 - 3457.84] uh-huh got some mushroom
[3454.72 - 3463.28] powder some shrooms yeah
[3457.84 - 3463.28] doing some shrooms i got some reishi
[3463.76 - 3467.52] and some chaga mushroom
[3469.76 - 3479.12] okay let me get some water
[3475.84 - 3482.32] so i'm making some chaga and reishi tea
[3479.12 - 3482.32] which i do occasionally
[3483.60 - 3487.68] which you're not going to find in this
[3485.68 - 3489.68] reishi mushroom
[3487.68 - 3490.72] you're not going to find caffeine in
[3489.68 - 3492.96] here
[3490.72 - 3494.48] so that's the chaga mushroom which
[3492.96 - 3496.40] you're not going to find in the rishi
[3494.48 - 3497.68] we're live i don't know what else to say
[3496.40 - 3500.48] we're not going to find
[3497.68 - 3500.88] caffeine in here you're not going to
[3500.48 - 3504.08] find
[3500.88 - 3505.76] caffeine mixed in here why
[3504.08 - 3507.60] because caffeine destroys your immune
[3505.76 - 3509.12] system i know i'm gonna get a whole
[3507.60 - 3510.16] bunch of crap from a lot of you guys
[3509.12 - 3514.88] right now like
[3510.16 - 3517.20] what about decaf coffee what about
[3514.88 - 3518.64] what about my green tea what about my
[3517.20 - 3521.44] matcha tea
[3518.64 - 3523.44] you're not your caffeine lowers your
[3521.44 - 3526.48] immune system
[3523.44 - 3529.12] it can set you up for a bad flu
[3526.48 - 3530.16] it could set you up if people are around
[3529.12 - 3533.76] people that actually
[3530.16 - 3534.32] have the flu or or something that looks
[3533.76 - 3535.92] like it
[3534.32 - 3537.36] or anything like it or a plague or
[3535.92 - 3538.00] anything it's not even just that if
[3537.36 - 3539.28] you've got
[3538.00 - 3541.68] immune system problems you got
[3539.28 - 3542.64] autoimmune you don't want caffeine mixed
[3541.68 - 3545.12] in your mushroom
[3542.64 - 3546.24] powder so you don't want caffeine mixed
[3545.12 - 3549.44] in your rishi
[3546.24 - 3551.68] your chocolate yorishi
[3549.44 - 3552.72] so important to know you don't put
[3551.68 - 3555.52] coffee
[3552.72 - 3557.44] in rishi mushroom you don't put coffee
[3555.52 - 3559.44] in chaga
[3557.44 - 3561.28] and then pretend that gave you energy
[3559.44 - 3564.40] that the rishi gave you energy
[3561.28 - 3566.00] rishi is not known to give you energy
[3564.40 - 3567.44] change is not known to give you give you
[3566.00 - 3569.28] energy but they're good for the immune
[3567.44 - 3570.64] system but if you mix them with coffee
[3569.28 - 3572.24] you just destroyed it
[3570.64 - 3574.96] you destroy you're destroying your
[3572.24 - 3577.28] immune system
[3574.96 - 3579.44] caffeine destroys the immune system so
[3577.28 - 3582.40] if you mix caffeine with
[3579.44 - 3583.68] mushroom you don't even get the good out
[3582.40 - 3585.12] of the mushrooms because you're
[3583.68 - 3586.40] weakening your immune system when the
[3585.12 - 3588.48] mushroom's supposed to
[3586.40 - 3590.08] actually help your immune system because
[3588.48 - 3593.92] caffeine stimulates
[3590.08 - 3593.92] your adrenals right
[3596.32 - 3602.56] your adrenals caffeine blows them out
[3600.40 - 3604.56] blows them out boom blows them out
[3602.56 - 3607.92] that's what caffeine does
[3604.56 - 3611.60] blows them out important to know
[3607.92 - 3611.60] so i'm making some
[3612.00 - 3615.84] i'm making some mushroom tea
[3616.64 - 3621.68] so i got some rishi and some chaga
[3623.12 - 3629.44] okay that's a great immune system
[3627.12 - 3632.64] builder right there can have that once
[3629.44 - 3634.72] long i don't have it every day
[3632.64 - 3636.16] i just have it like a couple times a
[3634.72 - 3639.12] week a little bit
[3636.16 - 3639.68] here and there you can put raw honey in
[3639.12 - 3642.96] here
[3639.68 - 3645.52] i got some raw honey
[3642.96 - 3647.20] it's important to know though that
[3645.52 - 3650.24] literally people are out there
[3647.20 - 3652.48] and they just want to destroy people
[3650.24 - 3653.84] people love to destroy people they just
[3652.48 - 3655.04] love to destroy people that's what they
[3653.84 - 3656.72] do out there
[3655.04 - 3658.56] wild lizzie flower death by a thousand
[3656.72 - 3662.40] cuts out there
[3658.56 - 3665.12] people love to kill people
[3662.40 - 3665.76] you don't think so you don't think so
[3665.12 - 3669.60] okay
[3665.76 - 3672.88] then why take something so pure
[3669.60 - 3674.48] something so pure and then contaminate
[3672.88 - 3676.24] it with something that actually ages
[3674.48 - 3678.56] women
[3676.24 - 3679.68] ages women gets them addicted and ages
[3678.56 - 3683.04] women
[3679.68 - 3685.44] right makes their hair fall out
[3683.04 - 3688.40] because caffeine is a psychoactive drug
[3685.44 - 3691.76] so let's take a psychoactive drug
[3688.40 - 3693.44] stick it in something pure and good
[3691.76 - 3695.44] because people out there want to hurt
[3693.44 - 3699.04] people i don't know what else to say
[3695.44 - 3701.20] it is that i don't give me that there's
[3699.04 - 3702.72] no bad people out there don't give me
[3701.20 - 3705.36] that
[3702.72 - 3707.52] okay let's do some vitamin shock vitamin
[3705.36 - 3710.64] c shock therapy now
[3707.52 - 3713.84] let's do that vitamin c shock therapy is
[3710.64 - 3713.84] something that i really love
[3714.08 - 3717.04] i still have to talk about lysine i
[3715.76 - 3718.64] still have to talk about b12 for a
[3717.04 - 3723.04] couple of minutes
[3718.64 - 3724.96] so what i love about but first of all i
[3723.04 - 3727.12] take six capsules three times a day
[3724.96 - 3729.52] that's what i do six capsules three
[3727.12 - 3731.36] times a day that's what i do every day
[3729.52 - 3733.44] you do what your doctor does do i'm just
[3731.36 - 3736.72] saying that's what i do right
[3733.44 - 3740.56] but if you feel something coming on
[3736.72 - 3742.40] spirit of compassion put together this
[3740.56 - 3746.00] vitamin c
[3742.40 - 3746.00] shock therapy right
[3746.48 - 3751.28] and it really works so
[3752.72 - 3755.84] pouring some water in here
[3756.80 - 3761.92] i really i really appreciate your
[3759.12 - 3761.92] patience you guys
[3762.80 - 3766.56] why i play around in here with
[3766.84 - 3772.00] everything
[3768.16 - 3775.12] truly i'm truly honored for real
[3772.00 - 3780.84] so i'm doing two capsules of vitamin c
[3775.12 - 3783.84] every two hours i am going to add some
[3780.84 - 3783.84] orange
[3785.04 - 3791.84] got some orange in there i am going to
[3788.64 - 3791.84] put some honey in there
[3793.52 - 3797.68] this is an immune builder drink immune
[3796.40 - 3800.24] builder tonic
[3797.68 - 3800.24] right here
[3802.64 - 3808.40] right so i got two capsules of vitamin c
[3806.16 - 3810.40] not just any seed it's the microc you
[3808.40 - 3811.28] guys don't have this type of if you guys
[3810.40 - 3814.40] are
[3811.28 - 3816.16] are using a vitamin c you'll when you
[3814.40 - 3819.60] experience this someday
[3816.16 - 3820.40] if you ever like branch on to using say
[3819.60 - 3822.72] the microc
[3820.40 - 3824.08] you'll notice the difference it won't
[3822.72 - 3826.56] burn a hole in your stomach
[3824.08 - 3827.60] it's not like battery acid so i just put
[3826.56 - 3832.24] honey in here
[3827.60 - 3835.92] squeeze of orange two capsules of microc
[3832.24 - 3838.56] every two hours every two waking hours
[3835.92 - 3840.24] awake every two hours there's rose hips
[3838.56 - 3841.52] in this microc by the way i know a lot
[3840.24 - 3843.36] of people like well i'm not gonna
[3841.52 - 3844.80] i'm not gonna venture on to unless it's
[3843.36 - 3847.84] got rose hips
[3844.80 - 3847.84] there's rose hips in there
[3847.92 - 3853.92] so every two hours
[3851.60 - 3855.68] waking two hours because if you're
[3853.92 - 3856.08] sleeping you don't want to wake yourself
[3855.68 - 3858.00] up
[3856.08 - 3859.92] to try to actually take this you want to
[3858.00 - 3866.48] sleep
[3859.92 - 3869.60] right so yeah
[3866.48 - 3873.04] there we go that's it mixed it up that's
[3869.60 - 3873.04] the vitamin c shock therapy
[3873.28 - 3879.84] it's really good too every two hours
[3877.84 - 3881.28] that's a great technique for the immune
[3879.84 - 3882.80] system you think you're coming down with
[3881.28 - 3886.48] something you think something's up
[3882.80 - 3886.48] okay let's talk about lysine
[3886.56 - 3892.56] it's the inhibitor of viruses the
[3889.52 - 3894.16] herpetic family viruses
[3892.56 - 3895.84] it's all the different herpes families
[3894.16 - 3897.52] the shingles viruses the ebv
[3895.84 - 3899.52] viruses the sedimentary virus all the
[3897.52 - 3900.96] viruses that actually plague everybody i
[3899.52 - 3904.56] like it for any virus
[3900.96 - 3906.40] any virus any virus but but lysine is a
[3904.56 - 3908.08] helpful way to heal you got the vertigo
[3906.40 - 3909.04] that's that's viral you got the ringing
[3908.08 - 3910.40] in the ears
[3909.04 - 3912.32] you got the tinnitus that's fire you got
[3910.40 - 3913.92] the floaters in the eyes that's viral
[3912.32 - 3915.92] you see you guys got the blurry eyes
[3913.92 - 3917.52] that are unexplained that's viral right
[3915.92 - 3919.28] you guys got the pain that you know is
[3917.52 - 3920.88] not a tooth but you got the jaw pain and
[3919.28 - 3922.16] you got the neck pain you got all kinds
[3920.88 - 3925.04] of different pain in the migraines
[3922.16 - 3925.92] viral shingles epstein-barr right
[3925.04 - 3927.20] simplex one
[3925.92 - 3928.64] all these things cause all these
[3927.20 - 3930.48] problems even if you don't have a
[3928.64 - 3932.00] shingles rash or a fever blister in the
[3930.48 - 3933.28] moment the viruses are still in us they
[3932.00 - 3935.92] go into our brain stem
[3933.28 - 3937.04] they just they just the neurotoxins go
[3935.92 - 3938.64] into the brain stuff
[3937.04 - 3940.24] they cause vagus nerve problems they
[3938.64 - 3940.72] cause phrenic nerve problems all that
[3940.24 - 3942.40] stuff
[3940.72 - 3944.24] and what i love about lysine it's a
[3942.40 - 3945.60] great way to recover it should be in
[3944.24 - 3948.08] somebody's protocol
[3945.60 - 3948.80] robinson k says definitely works well
[3948.08 - 3950.40] the vitamin c
[3948.80 - 3952.40] shock therapy and zinc shock therapy
[3950.40 - 3955.84] works incredible it's
[3952.40 - 3957.52] here did i tell you guys that
[3955.84 - 3960.32] medical medium information right leads
[3957.52 - 3962.08] the way advanced information
[3960.32 - 3963.76] and then there's a whole bunch of closet
[3962.08 - 3967.04] doers
[3963.76 - 3968.48] they're closet mm people meaning all the
[3967.04 - 3970.00] podcast doctors that take the
[3968.48 - 3971.68] information are all doing the celery
[3970.00 - 3973.12] juice in the closet
[3971.68 - 3974.48] they're all doing the protocols the same
[3973.12 - 3976.00] shock therapy for their own calls and
[3974.48 - 3978.08] flu's in the closet
[3976.00 - 3980.32] they just can't talk about it because
[3978.08 - 3981.92] then medical mean gets credit
[3980.32 - 3983.44] i've actually heard this many times i've
[3981.92 - 3984.56] know i've known doctors over the years
[3983.44 - 3988.40] including recently
[3984.56 - 3991.52] that no doctors that closet mm
[3988.40 - 3995.36] they do all it's all mm closet stuff
[3991.52 - 3996.16] big time the podcast people the youtube
[3995.36 - 3997.76] doctors
[3996.16 - 3999.04] this youtube doctor recently stole all
[3997.76 - 4000.48] the shingles information from medical
[3999.04 - 4001.36] medium and acted like it came from a
[4000.48 - 4003.84] study and then when you look at the
[4001.36 - 4005.84] study it's not in there
[4003.84 - 4006.96] it's it the closet medical meet is all
[4005.84 - 4010.48] about doing you know
[4006.96 - 4012.96] doing medical medium in the closet
[4010.48 - 4015.04] you can take a lot less of supplements
[4012.96 - 4017.04] than what i take or recommend
[4015.04 - 4021.84] in the books too you can read the book
[4017.04 - 4023.68] and learn how you can take less
[4021.84 - 4025.04] right ashley kevin good to see you you

[4025.04 - 4030.48] keep on moving forward b12
[4026.64 - 4033.92] is the next one b12
[4030.48 - 4035.76] closet mm robinson case is closet mm yes
[4033.92 - 4036.96] podcast doctors are doing medical medium
[4035.76 - 4040.24] information
[4036.96 - 4041.76] secretly secretly
[4040.24 - 4043.20] podcast doctors do they use the
[4041.76 - 4044.24] information they use it they drink
[4043.20 - 4045.76] celery juice
[4044.24 - 4048.64] it's been reported to me over and over
[4045.76 - 4050.24] again by the other doctors
[4048.64 - 4052.08] thousands of doctors thousands of
[4050.24 - 4053.20] naturopaths take medical medium info
[4052.08 - 4054.88] that's why they're doing the zinc the
[4053.20 - 4055.44] licorice root now and all this protocol
[4054.88 - 4057.52] stuff
[4055.44 - 4059.28] and they're they're secretly doing
[4057.52 - 4063.04] medical medium in their practices or
[4059.28 - 4066.24] meaning in their own life yeah
[4063.04 - 4068.56] it's good to know let's try to move on a
[4066.24 - 4070.80] little bit b12 every single cell in your
[4068.56 - 4072.56] body needs b12 so yes it's part of our
[4070.80 - 4074.32] immune system because every single cell
[4072.56 - 4077.12] in your body every single immune cell
[4074.32 - 4078.64] relies on b12 every single killer cell
[4077.12 - 4081.44] immune cell basophils
[4078.64 - 4082.48] monocytes lymphocytes neutrophils uh
[4081.44 - 4087.20] white blood cells
[4082.48 - 4089.68] just everything needs b12
[4087.20 - 4092.08] diana case meyer says i've heard celery
[4089.68 - 4095.04] juice and a lot of similar from before
[4092.08 - 4098.08] you were out of diapers laugh out loud

[4107.44 - 4112.64] wasn't here before sorry yes
[4110.64 - 4114.48] someone might have juiced it once by
[4112.64 - 4116.08] itself in a juicer because they juiced
[4114.48 - 4117.76] every single fruit and vegetable
[4116.08 - 4119.12] as a little experiment let me juice
[4117.76 - 4122.40] carrots
[4119.12 - 4124.64] let me juice beets let me juice celery
[4122.40 - 4126.56] but nobody knew 16 ounces on an empty
[4124.64 - 4127.84] stomach 32 ounces for recovery and
[4126.56 - 4129.44] health nobody knew what it did nobody
[4127.84 - 4132.08] knew about seven clusters of
[4129.44 - 4132.88] shots uh salt nobody knew about anything
[4132.08 - 4135.28] about it

[4144.48 - 4149.76] ever run through a juicer at one time
[4146.88 - 4151.44] yes it did but nobody knew how to use it
[4149.76 - 4153.04] as a therapeutic tool to bring
[4151.44 - 4155.68] somebody's life back
[4153.04 - 4157.60] and if that information isn't there it's
[4155.68 - 4158.72] dead in the water and nobody uses it and
[4157.60 - 4160.32] no one heals

[4240.16 - 4244.08] psychiatrist and is wondering if you
[4242.80 - 4246.72] forgot your medication
[4244.08 - 4249.12] today he recommends you going to your
[4246.72 - 4252.16] doctor immediately
[4249.12 - 4256.16] and making sure that all your pills
[4252.16 - 4256.16] are correct what else
[4257.52 - 4264.16] dr nesbit says that diana
[4261.04 - 4267.12] he says make sure you check with your
[4264.16 - 4267.60] your physician that your psychiatric
[4267.12 - 4273.84] meds
[4267.60 - 4273.84] are in order
[4275.04 - 4278.88] dr nesbitt said that if your psychiatric
[4277.28 - 4282.00] meds aren't in water then
[4278.88 - 4283.68] what if they are in order he says dr
[4282.00 - 4286.16] nesbit said that if your psychiatric
[4283.68 - 4287.76] meds are in perfect order
[4286.16 - 4289.44] then you might be ready for a straight
[4287.76 - 4291.84] jacket really
[4289.44 - 4294.56] it's terrible to say that that's
[4291.84 - 4298.00] actually horrible
[4294.56 - 4301.52] dr desmond says that for you to sit here
[4298.00 - 4304.80] and lie
[4301.52 - 4304.80] to try to discredit
[4305.20 - 4309.92] me means you're

[4320.16 - 4325.36] yeah dr nesbit what what do you
[4322.48 - 4330.16] recommend for diana
[4325.36 - 4333.68] dr nesbit says he recommends diana seek
[4330.16 - 4335.76] psychiatric help and care and she might
[4333.68 - 4339.20] even be certifiable
[4335.76 - 4340.80] that's that's that's terrible
[4339.20 - 4342.88] the only thing that's the only problem
[4340.80 - 4344.32] with dr nesbitt and i i don't mean to
[4342.88 - 4345.68] disrespect you on any level
[4344.32 - 4349.28] like dr nesbit i don't mean to
[4345.68 - 4351.52] disrespect i just don't know if i like
[4349.28 - 4352.40] everything you say and i'm not
[4351.52 - 4355.52] supportive
[4352.40 - 4357.36] of everything you're saying so uh
[4355.52 - 4358.88] i just need that known and i'm not
[4357.36 - 4362.80] supportive of everything
[4358.88 - 4364.72] dr nesbitt's saying yeah did that i i'm
[4362.80 - 4368.84] not supportive
[4364.72 - 4370.16] i i yeah dr nesbit that's dr nesbitt's
[4368.84 - 4374.16] opinion
[4370.16 - 4377.44] okay that gives me back to surgery okay
[4374.16 - 4379.44] yep okay all right we
[4377.44 - 4385.44] we gotta get going okay dr nesmet's
[4379.44 - 4387.28] going back to surgery you guys
[4385.44 - 4389.36] talk about the b12 every single cell in
[4387.28 - 4389.92] the body relies on it it's critical
[4389.36 - 4393.52] every
[4389.92 - 4395.84] pepper seed good to see you every single
[4393.52 - 4396.64] every single cell in the body relies on
[4395.84 - 4398.88] b12
[4396.64 - 4401.20] very important to know you guys so i ran
[4398.88 - 4403.36] across a lot of the
[4401.20 - 4404.88] and then the curcumin great for the
[4403.36 - 4407.04] immune system
[4404.88 - 4408.08] it's got antibiotic antibacterial
[4407.04 - 4410.72] properties
[4408.08 - 4411.28] not real real strong ones but it has
[4410.72 - 4413.20] them
[4411.28 - 4415.04] and i love all that like when mixing it
[4413.20 - 4416.80] up because different viruses respond
[4415.04 - 4418.64] differently to different things and your
[4416.80 - 4421.84] immune system responds differently
[4418.64 - 4423.36] so like i like uh curcumin because it's
[4421.84 - 4425.52] a natural aspirin
[4423.36 - 4427.04] you know if you're working out and you
[4425.52 - 4429.68] pull something out
[4427.04 - 4430.48] if you like you push yourself too hard
[4429.68 - 4432.32] if you're
[4430.48 - 4434.48] chronically ill and you don't work out
[4432.32 - 4436.32] but yet you push yourself really hard
[4434.48 - 4437.12] just trying to get like from one room to
[4436.32 - 4439.44] another
[4437.12 - 4440.16] curcumin's really great either way you
[4439.44 - 4441.84] know it's
[4440.16 - 4444.00] it's a major workout for somebody who
[4441.84 - 4444.88] has chronic illness to even get into a
[4444.00 - 4446.80] shower
[4444.88 - 4448.24] sometimes the water can almost knock
[4446.80 - 4449.36] people over who have been through hell
[4448.24 - 4450.88] and back and they got severe
[4449.36 - 4453.68] neurological fatigue
[4450.88 - 4454.00] i've seen this for years and and they
[4453.68 - 4456.24] can
[4454.00 - 4458.08] strain something just literally going to
[4456.24 - 4459.68] bathroom or getting up and doing
[4458.08 - 4462.16] something or working in the kitchen
[4459.68 - 4463.92] lifting something i always love curcumin
[4462.16 - 4465.52] as someone's recovering from chronic
[4463.92 - 4467.12] illness and coming back from it and they
[4465.52 - 4468.40] don't have the muscles yet they don't
[4467.12 - 4470.48] have that strength yet
[4468.40 - 4472.48] they're still really fatigued and going
[4470.48 - 4474.08] through so much but yet they're healing
[4472.48 - 4475.76] and on their way to healings they love
[4474.08 - 4477.20] human for all these reasons and
[4475.76 - 4478.64] for someone who's already healed and
[4477.20 - 4480.88] they're exercising again and they got
[4478.64 - 4483.84] their life back and they're exercising
[4480.88 - 4483.84] right
[4483.92 - 4488.16] i thought that dr nesbit really said
[4485.92 - 4491.68] some just harsh things sometimes and
[4488.16 - 4491.68] that's why you know i told you guys
[4492.56 - 4497.04] okay anyway i ran across a whole bunch
[4495.04 - 4498.72] of different supplements let's just
[4497.04 - 4501.52] talk about some time water i'm gonna put
[4498.72 - 4504.32] some thyme in here and let it sit
[4501.52 - 4505.84] sit for a while you guys don't mind it's
[4504.32 - 4507.36] a great immune system one right there
[4505.84 - 4508.88] i'm gonna make a time water
[4507.36 - 4510.72] i'm putting time in here in a big
[4508.88 - 4513.12] picture of water that's
[4510.72 - 4513.77] medical medium informational tools right
[4513.12 - 4515.60] there
[4513.77 - 4518.72] [Music]
[4515.60 - 4520.00] okay gonna have that going as well got
[4518.72 - 4523.84] my chaga rishi
[4520.00 - 4525.44] tea remember if they want to stick
[4523.84 - 4527.12] caffeine into rishi mushroom in your
[4525.44 - 4530.96] chaga mushroom they're
[4527.12 - 4532.56] totally just
[4530.96 - 4534.56] trying to get you hooked and addicted so
[4532.56 - 4536.84] you always buy the product
[4534.56 - 4538.00] and stay high in caffeine it's just it's
[4536.84 - 4540.16] dark
[4538.00 - 4542.96] it's dark stuff caffeine knocks down
[4540.16 - 4544.24] your immune system so
[4542.96 - 4545.36] if you're gonna knock down your immune
[4544.24 - 4546.56] system because you're addicted to
[4545.36 - 4549.52] caffeine
[4546.56 - 4551.68] do it separately for from your chaga and
[4549.52 - 4552.08] your rishi do that separately not at the
[4551.68 - 4555.20] same
[4552.08 - 4557.28] time as your caffeine natural flavors
[4555.20 - 4559.04] are in protein powders natural flavors
[4557.28 - 4560.96] are in all these different products now
[4559.04 - 4562.88] you guys because it's msg and it's
[4560.96 - 4564.96] addictive so it does something to the
[4562.88 - 4567.76] receptors of the neurons

[4567.76 - 4570.88] it's in supplements so you stay addicted
[4569.52 - 4572.72] to your supplements if you see natural
[4570.88 - 4574.08] flavorings in your supplements
[4572.72 - 4576.48] that's to keep you addicted to the

[4718.96 - 4722.16] meal what people do when they start
[4720.64 - 4723.60] getting sick or they're chronically ill
[4722.16 - 4725.28] they eat too much fat they fat
[4723.60 - 4727.12] themselves to sickness
[4725.28 - 4728.80] that's what happens so when someone's
[4727.12 - 4730.64] catching a flu or they're getting the
[4728.80 - 4732.08] plague i can't tell you how many people
[4730.64 - 4735.84] who are getting the plague where their
[4732.08 - 4735.84] taste buds were starting to go
[4739.76 - 4742.40] mary ann says in your email you're going
[4741.20 - 4745.12] to talk about what's coming so we're

[4745.12 - 4753.92] i am at your service
[4748.72 - 4753.92] i'm here to please all for free
[4757.28 - 4761.20] okay so what you got on here is a banana
[4759.44 - 4764.16] you got some garlic clove chopped up
[4761.20 - 4765.60] boom thrown on there you got honey right
[4764.16 - 4768.56] and
[4765.60 - 4769.52] little lemon to moisten the sheet you
[4768.56 - 4771.84] got yourself
[4769.52 - 4773.84] the immune system nori roll right there
[4771.84 - 4776.00] okay why is it the immune system normal
[4773.84 - 4777.68] for one it doesn't have fat in there
[4776.00 - 4779.04] when people start getting sick they
[4777.68 - 4779.84] start coming down with something the
[4779.04 - 4782.80] first thing they do
[4779.84 - 4784.64] is they eat they eat they're like i need
[4782.80 - 4786.16] something i'm getting sick i'm feeling
[4784.64 - 4788.00] sick i need to eat and they end up
[4786.16 - 4789.44] eating fat oil
[4788.00 - 4791.04] they end up having olive oil on
[4789.44 - 4792.56] something they need to be nuts and seeds
[4791.04 - 4794.00] nut butters i've seen people eat a half
[4792.56 - 4795.68] a jar of peanut butter as they were
[4794.00 - 4797.36] getting sick
[4795.68 - 4798.88] their taste buds get funny they feel
[4797.36 - 4800.32] like they have to eat their throat's
[4798.88 - 4801.76] getting a little funny so they start
[4800.32 - 4803.44] eating and they end up eating a heavy
[4801.76 - 4804.08] meal whether it's animal protein or it's
[4803.44 - 4806.72] plant-based
[4804.08 - 4808.00] fat you know like avocados and nuts and
[4806.72 - 4809.76] seeds and oils or
[4808.00 - 4811.28] chicken or fish or something they end up
[4809.76 - 4812.88] eating and the minute they
[4811.28 - 4814.72] throw all that fat in their system they
[4812.88 - 4816.80] just explode at the virus and now the
[4814.72 - 4818.00] vibe meaning the virus just proliferates
[4816.80 - 4819.52] like crazy because you don't
[4818.00 - 4822.00] have oxygen anymore in your bloodstream
[4819.52 - 4824.32] because it's filled with fat
[4822.00 - 4825.36] this is a fat free option that's an
[4824.32 - 4829.12] immune
[4825.36 - 4831.20] buster because it's a bug buster
[4829.12 - 4832.96] you got the garlic and the honey the
[4831.20 - 4834.64] honey is anti-viral
[4832.96 - 4837.36] so you got the raw honey sitting right
[4834.64 - 4837.92] in here you've got iodine in the noria
[4837.36 - 4839.60] sheet
[4837.92 - 4842.32] iodine is an antiseptic against
[4839.60 - 4844.40] pathogens
[4842.32 - 4846.80] bananas are antiviral did you guys know
[4844.40 - 4848.08] that bananas have antiviral properties
[4846.80 - 4850.88] and then you got the garlic which is
[4848.08 - 4853.84] antiviral right
[4850.88 - 4855.60] great for you know great bugs for any
[4853.84 - 4858.96] kind of bugs viruses
[4855.60 - 4861.28] bugs and viruses and pathogens explode
[4858.96 - 4863.20] they explode they proliferate when you
[4861.28 - 4865.68] start downing fat when you're sick
[4863.20 - 4866.80] you instead of having them explode by
[4865.68 - 4869.36] proliferating them
[4866.80 - 4870.24] you want to explode them by killing them
[4869.36 - 4873.20] so you want
[4870.24 - 4874.08] foods that actually help so you can you
[4873.20 - 4875.60] can your immune system
[4874.08 - 4877.12] can go and destroy that virus or
[4875.60 - 4878.40] anything you're taking can go destroy
[4877.12 - 4880.56] the virus the minute you're starting to
[4878.40 - 4882.40] get sick you've got that golden seal
[4880.56 - 4884.00] going down but you don't need a steak
[4882.40 - 4885.04] dinner with your golden seal
[4884.00 - 4887.12] because you're going to be doing all
[4885.04 - 4888.00] this fat you don't need a chicken dinner
[4887.12 - 4889.52] when you're starting to get
[4888.00 - 4890.88] sick as you're taking your golden seal
[4889.52 - 4891.36] yeah you still should take your golden
[4890.88 - 4893.20] seal
[4891.36 - 4894.64] but the problem is if everybody's
[4893.20 - 4896.32] fatting themselves to death as they're
[4894.64 - 4899.44] getting sick or anything's happening
[4896.32 - 4902.56] then it defeats the purpose
[4899.44 - 4903.92] all right so let's talk about what's
[4902.56 - 4906.24] coming
[4903.92 - 4907.28] i've already mentioned this months ago
[4906.24 - 4909.44] and right now we're
[4907.28 - 4910.48] up against a flu now and a plague flu
[4909.44 - 4912.00] we're up against two
[4910.48 - 4913.36] we're up against a stomach flu right now
[4912.00 - 4914.72] that's out there and starting to swish
[4913.36 - 4916.24] around out there
[4914.72 - 4917.84] it's all kept into the wire no one's
[4916.24 - 4918.32] talking about it but everybody's getting
[4917.84 - 4919.84] it
[4918.32 - 4922.88] there's a reason they don't talk about
[4919.84 - 4926.08] it and then you got the plague
[4922.88 - 4929.28] up and amp and up cranking up right
[4926.08 - 4930.48] so you got that going down too so that's
[4929.28 - 4931.84] on the up and up
[4930.48 - 4933.92] and we're going to head to a place where
[4931.84 - 4935.28] after the summer after because everybody
[4933.92 - 4936.88] is like in this this place where they're
[4935.28 - 4938.56] just well i'm so sick of the whole thing
[4936.88 - 4940.00] i'm so sick of everything going on
[4938.56 - 4942.00] and everybody's out and about and doing
[4940.00 - 4943.60] their thing but people are passing
[4942.00 - 4946.08] around a lot of bugs right now
[4943.60 - 4947.44] passed around a lot of epstein bars
[4946.08 - 4948.72] because they haven't been around people
[4947.44 - 4950.40] so they're passing around a lot of
[4948.72 - 4952.00] epstein bars people are
[4950.40 - 4953.84] doing a lot of stuff out there and
[4952.00 - 4955.36] passing around a lot of simplexes epson
[4953.84 - 4956.96] bar and shingles
[4955.36 - 4958.16] and then we got the flus going around
[4956.96 - 4960.88] and the plague going around and it's
[4958.16 - 4962.24] going to take us to the fall
[4960.88 - 4964.80] and it's going to take us into early
[4962.24 - 4967.44] winter and
[4964.80 - 4969.28] it's going to be pretty bad not to
[4967.44 - 4972.64] mention what's coming along with this
[4969.28 - 4974.00] which is the uptick a massive uptick of
[4972.64 - 4975.76] chronic illness
[4974.00 - 4977.84] which is going to be hushed hushed for a
[4975.76 - 4979.20] while it's not going to be talked about
[4977.84 - 4980.56] no one's going to know about it but
[4979.20 - 4982.96] people are going to be like
[4980.56 - 4984.64] chronically sick fatigue like never
[4982.96 - 4986.56] before autoimmune disease is being
[4984.64 - 4988.32] diagnosed left and right chronic
