[9.04 - 15.76] find out what's making you sick and how
[10.92 - 18.32] to heal Anthony William is the medical
[15.76 - 19.72] medium hello I'm Anthony William and
[18.32 - 21.40] you're listening to the medical medium
[19.72 - 23.52] radio show where each week I talk about
[21.40 - 25.20] the most advanced healing information
[23.52 - 27.60] and secrets about health much of which
[25.20 - 29.60] is not found anywhere else and is
[27.60 - 31.76] decades ahead of what's out there now as
[29.60 - 34.08] I've always said who has 10 or 20 years
[31.76 - 37.04] to wait for answers for their illnesses
[34.08 - 38.92] people have waited so many years in
[37.04 - 40.84] literally sick for so many years without
[38.92 - 42.96] having answers to heal people who have
[40.84 - 45.08] come to me over the years didn't have to
[42.96 - 46.92] wait anymore they got the answers they
[45.08 - 48.68] got the answers many many many years ago
[46.92 - 50.48] they live good lives after that because
[48.68 - 51.88] of it they've been healed since they
[50.48 - 53.08] don't even go and look at other
[51.88 - 54.52] information out there that's all
[53.08 - 55.60] scrambled eggs on the Internet or in
[54.52 - 57.16] other books because they know what
[55.60 - 59.68] healed them they know what to stick to
[57.16 - 61.32] and they don't get thwarted or confused
[59.68 - 64.28] when they see other stuff going around
[61.32 - 66.04] like lectin like the whole lectin thing
[64.28 - 68.84] the whole lectin Theory and the whole
[66.04 - 72.16] lectin blunder that people are trying to
[68.84 - 74.08] hang their hat on unbelievable and so
[72.16 - 76.80] wait till we go into this this is so
[74.08 - 78.48] important because you know what happens
[76.80 - 80.48] with the whole thing with with medical
[78.48 - 82.80] research and science is that medical
[80.48 - 85.32] research and science still ignores what
[82.80 - 88.12] causes chronic illness today still
[85.32 - 90.72] ignores what's C causing chronic illness
[88.12 - 92.76] this is on purpose so it trinkles down
[90.72 - 95.80] to the alternative movement too where we
[92.76 - 97.64] just ignore the truth of what causes
[95.80 - 99.32] illnesses in people all the different
[97.64 - 101.12] autoimmune diseases all the different
[99.32 - 103.88] symptoms and conditions all the mystery
[101.12 - 105.68] of all of it in the thyroid healing book
[103.88 - 107.00] I talked about over a hundred symptoms
[105.68 - 109.44] and conditions and I talked about what
[107.00 - 111.48] the real cause is but they don't even
[109.44 - 113.88] have answers to the simplest aches and
[111.48 - 115.56] pains to the simplest with the simplest
[113.88 - 117.88] tingles and numbness to the simplest
[115.56 - 119.36] little you know migraine there's no
[117.88 - 121.12] answers there's no answers for anybody
[119.36 - 123.24] for any of it it not even for acne
[121.12 - 125.08] there's an answer for it I mean we have
[123.24 - 128.72] the answers here but that's how it works
[125.08 - 131.56] it's unbelievable the lectin theory the
[128.72 - 133.88] letin theory is unbelievable and I'm
[131.56 - 135.88] going to talk about why so you can be
[133.88 - 138.00] careful so you don't cheat yourself out
[135.88 - 139.84] of a healing process because if you want
[138.00 - 142.12] to go on a wild goose chase along with
[139.84 - 144.24] the last 50,000 Wild Goose chases that
[142.12 - 146.40] have all come out over and over and over
[144.24 - 148.60] again and you want to hop on to another
[146.40 - 150.92] one which is the lectin fear and you
[148.60 - 153.04] want to hop on into that that wild goose
[150.92 - 154.48] chase and you want to keep on going with
[153.04 - 156.32] that you're going to be stuck in the
[154.48 - 158.48] same place you started from a long time
[156.32 - 159.92] ago while somebody made a hell of a lot
[158.48 - 161.40] of money out there people made a hell of
[159.92 - 163.48] a lot of money all hanging their hats on
[161.40 - 165.52] the lectin phase for a while Bank
[163.48 - 167.48] rolling it Bank rolling it what you get
[165.52 - 169.16] thed for another decade in your life
[167.48 - 171.64] while you're sick it's so perfect it's
[169.16 - 173.44] unbelievable how it works and you got to
[171.64 - 175.60] be careful because the whole point is I
[173.44 - 177.84] got your back here and I'm looking out
[175.60 - 179.44] for you that's the whole point I'm
[177.84 - 181.52] looking out for you and giving you the
[179.44 - 183.28] direction that you need to go so it's
[181.52 - 184.72] really important this show here if this

[186.64 - 190.20] information here doesn't come from
[188.08 - 192.08] interest groups on any level medical
[190.20 - 194.80] funding with strings attached botch
[192.08 - 197.60] research lobbyist internal kick packs
[194.80 - 200.20] there isn't all this money coming in in
[197.60 - 201.80] different places I'm not selling all
[200.20 - 203.96] these things and all kinds of money

[221.12 - 225.16] behind it botched research with the
[222.72 - 227.16] thumb on the scale the medical lobbyist
[225.16 - 229.04] medical internal Kickbacks persuaded
[227.16 - 231.72] belief systems private panels of
[229.04 - 233.40] influencers persuaded belief systems got
[231.72 - 235.32] to be careful with those because they

[241.36 - 245.40] symptoms and conditions running to their
[243.32 - 246.88] doctors don't even know what's wrong
[245.40 - 248.92] most of them when it comes down to
[246.88 - 250.64] chronic illness I'm not talking about
[248.92 - 252.16] nuts and bolts I'm not talking about
[250.64 - 254.04] when you need a heart valve change I'm
[252.16 - 256.60] not talking about when you when you take
[254.04 - 258.68] a kidney out of someone I'm not talking

[262.88 - 267.36] about nuts and bolts I'm talking about
[264.68 - 269.04] chronic illness very important to
[267.36 - 271.32] understand and there's no health field
[269.04 - 273.52] payoffs or trendy traps involved in this
[271.32 - 274.96] information this is so important to
[273.52 - 277.20] understand it's pure untampered with
[274.96 - 280.24] clean from clean Source I was given a
[277.20 - 281.80] gift whether anybody likes it or not
[280.24 - 283.44] okay I didn't like getting the gift that
[281.80 - 285.28] I got because it wasn't even for me
[283.44 - 287.28] anyway it was for you guys so I was all
[285.28 - 290.04] upset when I was young because spirit
[287.28 - 291.84] said you know this gift isn't for you
[290.04 - 294.24] and you know I felt like oh I was told I
[291.84 - 297.04] was a gifted child I was told I was a
[294.24 - 298.72] gifted child because I could see disease
[297.04 - 300.12] and illness and see what's going on in
[298.72 - 302.00] people and no answer ansers and get
[300.12 - 303.52] information that was Advanced meaning
[302.00 - 305.80] the information you hear on the show I
[303.52 - 307.60] was talking about it 4 years old all the
[305.80 - 309.72] you listen to all these radio shows and
[307.60 - 312.20] read the books that information I knew
[309.72 - 313.92] since I was four years old okay so just
[312.20 - 316.08] so you understand because it was coming
[313.92 - 319.44] through no matter what through a voice I
[316.08 - 320.96] hear starting from that point and so
[319.44 - 322.60] we're going to cover this this is this
[320.96 - 325.92] is important to not today this is a good

[378.36 - 382.48] ashes you've risen out of the ashes a
[380.76 - 385.44] few times in your life you've been
[382.48 - 386.72] through hell here and there you've had
[385.44 - 388.52] some difficult times some struggles

[388.52 - 392.16] through it you persevered your rose out
[389.84 - 394.56] of the ashes through a variety of
[392.16 - 397.16] struggles that may have come your
[394.56 - 400.76] way but you're inherently a good person
[397.16 - 402.72] deep inside you're a good person but the
[400.76 - 406.28] one thing you can't do is park your car
[402.72 - 408.20] good you really stink at it you really
[406.28 - 410.52] stink at it you never hurt
[408.20 - 413.04] anybody you never heard anybody parking
[410.52 - 413.92] your car nothing ever happened and if it
[413.04 - 416.16] did who
[413.92 - 417.48] cares who cares if you bumped into
[416.16 - 419.76] somebody else's car but you don't even
[417.48 - 422.40] do that you just don't park good you're
[419.76 - 423.44] not known to be a good Parker so you
[422.40 - 426.40] going know back up the car and you're
[423.44 - 428.48] like oo I can't parallel park this is
[426.40 - 430.24] really hard you're you're you're 2 feet
[428.48 - 432.44] away from the curb you're 3 feet away
[430.24 - 436.20] from the curb and you're
[432.44 - 439.08] trying and word gets
[436.20 - 440.00] around word gets around rumor goes
[439.08 - 442.80] around
[440.00 - 445.40] town you're a terrible
[442.80 - 448.48] Parker and then it goes from there to
[445.40 - 450.40] something else you're just a bad person
[448.48 - 453.04] Rumor Has It
[450.40 - 456.20] you're just horrible you hurt
[453.04 - 458.20] people and rumor has it it's even worse
[456.20 - 459.60] than that you you all of a sudden rumor
[458.20 - 460.68] has it where you just don't even have a
[459.60 - 463.80] place in the
[460.68 - 466.68] community you can't even get a part-time
[463.80 - 469.36] job because no one wants to take you on
[466.68 - 471.24] because of rumors because you're
[469.36 - 473.20] electing you're
[471.24 - 475.36] electing even though the community in
[473.20 - 477.72] the town all has it
[475.36 - 479.84] confused even though you're inherently a
[477.72 - 482.56] great person a good Soul a good person a
[479.84 - 484.88] good being you don't mean any harm to
[482.56 - 487.28] anybody you didn't cause any harm to
[484.88 - 491.60] anybody didn't cause any harm to anybody
[487.28 - 496.60] at all somehow a rumor kind of took
[491.60 - 498.16] off and you're considered bad all around
[496.60 - 500.80] bad all around so all the good that
[498.16 - 502.88] you've ever done helping
[500.80 - 505.64] others all the good you've ever done
[502.88 - 507.40] when you washed When you washed your
[505.64 - 510.16] friend's daughter's
[507.40 - 511.76] knee when she got when when she scraped
[510.16 - 514.08] the cement from her when she fell off
[511.76 - 516.04] her skateboard and you and you actually
[514.08 - 519.04] made sure you you clean the
[516.04 - 521.80] wound and you put the Band-Aid
[519.04 - 523.56] on and her mommy who was a friend of
[521.80 - 525.24] yours was just so grateful that you did
[523.56 - 527.60] that and you did that all that gets just
[525.24 - 529.80] thrown thrown away like it didn't
[527.60 - 531.56] exist or the time where you were
[529.80 - 534.80] listening to a
[531.56 - 536.80] friend and friend was spilling all her
[534.80 - 538.64] pain and sorrow and everything and you
[536.80 - 540.92] truly had compassion and were listening
[538.64 - 543.24] and wanted to help in any way you
[540.92 - 545.20] could you said look you can stay over
[543.24 - 547.64] here at our house sometimes or whatever
[545.20 - 549.20] if you need to and all that disappears
[547.64 - 550.92] everything good you've ever done just
[549.20 - 553.72] gone
[550.92 - 555.68] gone everything good you've ever done
[553.72 - 558.44] for anyone and
[555.68 - 560.40] anything even the things that nobody
[558.44 - 561.92] even knows about that you've done how
[560.40 - 564.52] about that the things that the things
[561.92 - 566.04] that you've done for people that nobody
[564.52 - 568.84] really even knows
[566.04 - 571.88] about the neighbor every you know the
[568.84 - 574.76] neighbor every time a paper the Sunday
[571.88 - 576.16] paper comes and the and they leave the
[574.76 - 578.36] paper in the street versus in the
[576.16 - 579.56] driveway you're up earlier so you get
[578.36 - 581.24] out there and you actually pick it out
[579.56 - 584.64] of the street and you put it in your
[581.24 - 586.80] neighbor's driveway by their
[584.64 - 588.48] mailbox or just in their driveway
[586.80 - 589.92] whatever and no one ever knew because
[588.48 - 593.32] you just it was just small stuff you
[589.92 - 596.48] just didn't bother saying anything just
[593.32 - 598.48] small gestures of caring about anything
[596.48 - 600.60] or doing anything but they're important
[598.48 - 602.64] they're important
[600.60 - 604.32] and you know even to bigger things but
[602.64 - 607.76] all thrown away because a rumor has it
[604.32 - 610.12] you're a bad person you're toxic you do
[607.76 - 612.72] nothing but wrong and it all started
[610.12 - 614.56] from just not being a great Parker and
[612.72 - 615.40] just somehow it took off in all the
[614.56 - 617.60] wrong
[615.40 - 619.52] directions because yeah because you're
[617.60 - 621.84] electing is what it turns out to you
[619.52 - 625.96] actually are electing and that's just
[621.84 - 627.96] one example of what I'm even saying now
[625.96 - 629.32] I don't know if you're catching on yet
[627.96 - 632.72] some of you might be already know where
[629.32 - 634.12] I'm going but I'm going there let I just
[632.72 - 635.96] want to say something for decades
[634.12 - 639.40] medical research and science has been
[635.96 - 641.96] purposely developing toxic harmful
[639.40 - 644.36] theories to explain the causes of all
[641.96 - 648.08] your illnesses symptoms and
[644.36 - 650.64] conditions which is to them a mystery
[648.08 - 652.32] which is to them a mystery so research
[650.64 - 655.96] and science has been trying to create
[652.32 - 658.56] all these reasons why we're sick we're
[655.96 - 661.44] sick and they've been doing it for
[658.56 - 663.92] decades and decades okay it all started
[661.44 - 666.12] with it's all in your head that's why we
[663.92 - 667.72] were sick it's all in your head that's
[666.12 - 670.16] where it all started from it's all in
[667.72 - 671.72] your head you're crazy women are crazy
[670.16 - 673.44] you're crazy if you got some symptoms
[671.72 - 674.68] that are unexplainable in research and
[673.44 - 676.60] Science and the doctor doesn't know what
[674.68 - 678.44] it is you're crazy that's how it all
[676.60 - 679.84] started then it went to hormones
[678.44 - 681.24] everything's hormones now it's all your
[679.84 - 682.52] hormones hormones is why you're sick
[681.24 - 684.12] everybody's sick everybody's sick
[682.52 - 685.36] because of their hormones that's that's
[684.12 - 687.32] why they're sick they're only sick
[685.36 - 689.68] because of their hormones it went to
[687.32 - 691.60] that and then it went to the autoimmune
[689.68 - 693.20] Theory the autoimmune Theory where the
[691.60 - 694.64] body is attacking itself and destroying
[693.20 - 695.92] itself attacking healthy cells and
[694.64 - 697.52] healthy tissue your immune system is
[695.92 - 700.28] attacking healthy tissue because they
[697.52 - 701.96] can't explain what's really going on so
[700.28 - 704.00] they name everything autoimmune which is
[701.96 - 705.76] your body attacking itself which I did a
[704.00 - 707.36] whole chapter in thyroid healing if you
[705.76 - 709.72] want to know all the details in that the
[707.36 - 711.48] body does not attack itself on any level
[709.72 - 713.68] the theory was misguided to believe to
[711.48 - 715.36] begin with it was funded and backed by a
[713.68 - 716.84] lot of money and interest groups they
[715.36 - 718.12] had to come up with a theory they fought
[716.84 - 721.80] with a bunch of different theories they
[718.12 - 724.52] didn't have they didn't have real real
[721.80 - 726.12] documented information or studies but
[724.52 - 727.68] they went with the autoimmune Theory it
[726.12 - 729.60] was the best way to protect the medical
[727.68 - 731.00] establishment because what it was was if
[729.60 - 732.84] the medical establishment doesn't know
[731.00 - 735.44] what's wrong with you they need you to
[732.84 - 738.64] be the Fall Guy they need you to be the
[735.44 - 742.36] Fall Guy so that's where it went
[738.64 - 744.40] then okay and it's not the body
[742.36 - 746.00] attacking itself it's pathogens
[744.40 - 747.52] attacking the body I talk about it in
[746.00 - 749.52] the book I talk about it on the radio
[747.52 - 751.92] shows you know that now
[749.52 - 756.16] and your body's building antibodies to
[751.92 - 758.08] go after the pathogen the virus or or
[756.16 - 759.84] different variety of viruses or whatever
[758.08 - 761.68] going after the pathogen not your
[759.84 - 764.08] healthy cells the pathogens go after the
[761.68 - 766.16] healthy cells so that was nobody still
[764.08 - 768.32] knows that by the way nobody not even
[766.16 - 770.92] the best lectin experts even know that
[768.32 - 773.72] now they don't even know that it's
[770.92 - 776.00] incredible not even the best the best
[773.72 - 779.04] immunology immunologists even know that
[776.00 - 781.88] right now because somebody hung their
[779.04 - 784.80] hat on a theory they had to actually pay
[781.88 - 787.84] for and grandfather in and make it law
[784.80 - 790.72] so you lose so you lose these laws that
[787.84 - 793.56] are made make it so you lose that's
[790.72 - 795.68] right you lose it doesn't feel good
[793.56 - 798.76] losing but everybody keeps on losing and
[795.68 - 801.20] losing and losing it's
[798.76 - 802.56] unbelievable then it went to it got spun
[801.20 - 804.48] into some different directions you
[802.56 - 806.88] create your own illness you create your
[804.48 - 808.60] sickness so that's what happened there
[806.88 - 811.96] it's going into that direction by people
[808.60 - 814.48] who who aren't sick and don't have any
[811.96 - 815.92] answers for people who are sick and they
[814.48 - 818.32] get kind of spiritual and they're like
[815.92 - 820.32] oh you created it you created it you're
[818.32 - 822.16] creating it you're just you're not
[820.32 - 823.68] spiritually aligned you're creating it
[822.16 - 825.04] then it went to that whole thing that's
[823.68 - 829.12] pretty recent actually that's really
[825.04 - 831.92] recent I wrote about that too you know
[829.12 - 836.04] that's really A demented one and
[831.92 - 840.08] then then it's gone to Foods Foods
[836.04 - 841.36] causing your illness food Foods okay
[840.08 - 843.68] that's interesting that's kind of an
[841.36 - 846.28] alternative twist it it is led into not
[843.68 - 847.80] bad right Foods causing your illness
[846.28 - 852.84] causing your
[847.80 - 855.08] inflammation Foods don't cause
[852.84 - 858.24] inflammation oh dear
[855.08 - 860.52] lord it's unbelievable where we are
[858.24 - 863.84] today and the stupidity that we still
[860.52 - 867.68] were the place that we're at is
[863.84 - 871.56] unreal Foods don't cause
[867.68 - 874.00] inflammation till this day nobody knows
[871.56 - 877.24] in research and science alternative or
[874.00 - 881.12] conventional that there's that food
[877.24 - 885.40] feeds a virus which then for fuels
[881.12 - 888.08] itself releasing a poison or causing a
[885.40 - 891.36] direct attack upon the cells inside the
[888.08 - 893.72] body until this day research and science
[891.36 - 895.52] still don't even know not even the best
[893.72 - 897.24] people in the business the best top
[895.52 - 899.28] doctors you can find out there or
[897.24 - 901.76] so-called the best people in the
[899.28 - 905.56] industry still don't even know that
[901.76 - 908.24] viruses eat food they actually
[905.56 - 911.44] eat they actually consume through their
[908.24 - 915.40] cell membrane they actually absorb food
[911.44 - 918.48] fuel themselves feed and eat and
[915.40 - 920.00] eliminate like any species they still
[918.48 - 922.88] don't know
[920.00 - 924.80] this so food doesn't cause inflammation
[922.88 - 927.08] on any
[924.80 - 928.84] level this is why people without
[927.08 - 930.28] pathogens inside their body live to be
[928.84 - 932.12] 90 years old they didn't have any
[930.28 - 933.52] autoimmune they live fine they exercised
[932.12 - 935.48] their whole life everything was great
[933.52 - 937.20] sure they cause they got other problems
[935.48 - 939.12] going on they got heart disease finally
[937.20 - 940.60] by the time they were 88 years old but
[939.12 - 942.56] you know that's expected with all their
[940.60 - 944.08] high fat consumptions of foods they've
[942.56 - 945.16] been eating the high fat diets and
[944.08 - 948.28] clogging up their arteries and
[945.16 - 949.84] everything like that of course of course
[948.28 - 952.76] and if they did get a cancer yeah
[949.84 - 956.96] because cancers are from viruses viruses
[952.76 - 959.16] create cancers viruses feed off of
[956.96 - 962.16] foods but
[959.16 - 964.52] none of that's really known I mean it's
[962.16 - 967.08] known out there that a virus can create
[964.52 - 970.00] cancer that that is known out
[967.08 - 974.28] there but what's not is a virus feeds
[970.00 - 977.68] off of food and then creates the problem
[974.28 - 981.36] not the food not the food and in the
[977.68 - 983.32] best sit the best areas of level of
[981.36 - 984.88] knowledge that we have and alternative
[983.32 - 986.28] and conventional the best experts on the
[984.88 - 988.88] circuits I don't care where they are
[986.28 - 990.12] still don't even know that still don't
[988.88 - 993.00] even know
[990.12 - 996.68] that they don't even believe
[993.00 - 1001.68] that so that's the next place it's gone
[996.68 - 1004.44] so with that comes a new Theory with
[1001.68 - 1006.68] that comes a new Theory so the lectin
[1004.44 - 1009.00] theory eltin
[1006.68 - 1012.56] theory is said to believe it's a car
[1009.00 - 1014.32] carbohydrate binding protein eltin it's
[1012.56 - 1017.04] in all fruits and
[1014.32 - 1019.36] vegetables like legumes and nuts and
[1017.04 - 1022.24] everything and some grains and and all
[1019.36 - 1024.76] ingrains and it's the reason for illness
[1022.24 - 1028.76] today it's the reason for why we're sick
[1024.76 - 1031.56] today unbelievable arrogance un
[1028.76 - 1034.24] incredible entitlement incredible
[1031.56 - 1036.32] entitlement like you you guys you guys
[1034.24 - 1041.12] you have to understand what this really
[1036.32 - 1042.64] means and what this is this is to push
[1041.12 - 1045.40] aside
[1042.64 - 1047.96] everything that we need to look for in
[1045.40 - 1049.96] order to get people truly healed in the
[1047.96 - 1053.92] future and just throw it away and push
[1049.96 - 1056.40] it aside that's what this is so somebody
[1053.92 - 1060.40] and people can hang their hat
[1056.40 - 1063.12] now on this new Theory this popular
[1060.40 - 1065.76] Trend that's on the rise is the concern
[1063.12 - 1067.64] that certain foods are high in lectin
[1065.76 - 1071.00] and therefore have a negative effect on
[1067.64 - 1073.36] the health you have to understand that
[1071.00 - 1075.56] for decades there have been chronically
[1073.36 - 1078.00] sick people and for decades to come
[1075.56 - 1080.04] there will be chronically sick people
[1078.00 - 1082.24] please know that there's going to be
[1080.04 - 1084.28] chronically sick people for decades and
[1082.24 - 1087.08] decades to come without the right
[1084.28 - 1089.20] information not because of lectin when
[1087.08 - 1091.88] someone knows what's wrong with her or
[1089.20 - 1095.00] his body knows what's causing a symptom
[1091.88 - 1098.48] or condition and knows how to heal it
[1095.00 - 1099.92] she or he can heal it over dozens of
[1098.48 - 1102.92] years I've witnessed tens of thousands
[1099.92 - 1104.92] of people do just this you guys recover
[1102.92 - 1107.64] their health even from the most
[1104.92 - 1111.08] devastating conditions these recoveries
[1107.64 - 1114.12] had nothing to do with lectin
[1111.08 - 1116.60] concern I've witnessed tens of thousands
[1114.12 - 1119.92] of people healing and recovering
[1116.60 - 1122.20] throughout the 35 more than 35 years I
[1119.92 - 1124.20] have helped people with devastating
[1122.20 - 1127.56] conditions and these
[1124.20 - 1130.48] recoveries had nothing to do with
[1127.56 - 1132.56] lectin we can't live in a bubble where
[1130.48 - 1134.76] we believe that the that nobody got
[1132.56 - 1136.80] better from what ailed them until the
[1134.76 - 1139.04] lectin trend just came along until the
[1136.80 - 1141.44] lectin train Trend just just came along
[1139.04 - 1144.20] choo choo into
[1141.44 - 1147.16] the you know right down the
[1144.20 - 1149.20] tracks we can't just put a blind eye
[1147.16 - 1151.08] that people never healed from chronic
[1149.20 - 1153.44] illness before the lectin trend came
[1151.08 - 1155.12] along the promoters of lectin literature
[1153.44 - 1156.68] and Studies have been completely in the
[1155.12 - 1158.80] dark about the thousands and thousands
[1156.68 - 1161.44] of people who've healed without their
[1158.80 - 1165.60] trendy misinformation about
[1161.44 - 1168.04] lectin it's as if it's if it it's as if
[1165.60 - 1170.36] they've ignored people's healing because
[1168.04 - 1171.16] it didn't fit into their box of what
[1170.36 - 1174.24] they
[1171.16 - 1177.04] believed it didn't fit into their trendy
[1174.24 - 1179.60] box and whatever their belief system was
[1177.04 - 1181.12] so they just ignored the amount of
[1179.60 - 1184.72] people that have
[1181.12 - 1187.12] healed without any electing concern or
[1184.72 - 1190.96] fear along the
[1187.12 - 1194.48] way right they pretend that no one has
[1190.96 - 1196.64] ever healed from chronic illness at all
[1194.48 - 1198.88] in fact you can just bring somebody to
[1196.64 - 1200.60] some of these lectin people and say well
[1198.88 - 1203.36] this person healed from chronic illness
[1200.60 - 1206.24] doing this and they won't even
[1203.36 - 1208.52] care that won't even even be thrown into
[1206.24 - 1210.20] a study it won't even be thrown into a
[1208.52 - 1212.76] possibility of checking a study it won't
[1210.20 - 1215.16] meaning to actually to actually be used
[1212.76 - 1216.36] as leverage it won't even be thrown it
[1215.16 - 1218.44] that person would be crazy if they
[1216.36 - 1221.12] healed that means they were never sick
[1218.44 - 1223.08] they were crazy that's what that meant
[1221.12 - 1225.52] that's what that means unless it falls
[1223.08 - 1227.76] into lectin and our lectin studies and
[1225.52 - 1229.24] our lectin propaganda and our lectin
[1227.76 - 1230.88] literature unless you were part of the
[1229.24 - 1233.72] whole lectin thing you never healed from
[1230.88 - 1235.84] your chronic illness they pretend no one
[1233.72 - 1239.00] has ever healed from chronic illness so
[1235.84 - 1240.56] that they can build the lectin Empire
[1239.00 - 1242.28] you don't think there's a lectin Empire
[1240.56 - 1244.08] there's lectin Empires out there
[1242.28 - 1246.20] building see all you're going to hear it
[1244.08 - 1248.12] is the next few three four five years
[1246.20 - 1251.52] non-stop Le and Le is all you're going
[1248.12 - 1255.20] to hear and guess what sure people can
[1251.52 - 1259.68] remove processed foods with lectin in
[1255.20 - 1262.44] them people can remove processed foods
[1259.68 - 1264.52] people can go on trendy high fat high
[1262.44 - 1265.80] protein diets with no sugar in them for
[1264.52 - 1267.72] a little while and if they really
[1265.80 - 1269.72] weren't that sick and didn't have too
[1267.72 - 1271.12] many problems and has few sniffles and
[1269.72 - 1273.28] maybe nak in a pain they'll probably
[1271.12 - 1274.84] feel better but you take people that
[1273.28 - 1276.52] have real neurological mystery
[1274.84 - 1278.44] conditions by the millions that are out
[1276.52 - 1279.88] there and you want to play that game
[1278.44 - 1281.60] they don't get better they end up going
[1279.88 - 1283.12] around looking around another place to
[1281.60 - 1286.00] heal going around looking around for
[1283.12 - 1288.44] another place to heal and keep on going
[1286.00 - 1290.88] around yep whether it's lime disease
[1288.44 - 1292.92] whether it's real ra whether it's you
[1290.88 - 1294.84] know Hashimoto whether it's just they
[1292.92 - 1296.28] keep on going around cuz the Hashimoto
[1294.84 - 1297.84] creeps back in when you're on those
[1296.28 - 1299.68] high-fat diets those there's trendy
[1297.84 - 1301.40] high-fat diets that are anti- sugar and
[1299.68 - 1302.92] it creeps back in and they come back
[1301.40 - 1304.84] around again three more years later
[1302.92 - 1306.56] they're sick again five more years later
[1304.84 - 1308.44] they're sick again where's the lectin
[1306.56 - 1311.92] going to get you there then you it goes
[1308.44 - 1313.68] on and on and on and on this is a prime
[1311.92 - 1315.68] example like I said before I repeat it
[1313.68 - 1318.04] again of entitled ignorance the problem
[1315.68 - 1320.16] with lectin concern is that it removes
[1318.04 - 1324.04] foods that would actually stop the
[1320.16 - 1328.04] viruses and the other pathogens in your
[1324.04 - 1330.88] body that truly cause symptoms and
[1328.04 - 1332.80] disease did you hear that did you hear
[1330.88 - 1334.28] that the problem is with the lectin
[1332.80 - 1336.00] concern is that it removes bodies that
[1334.28 - 1339.00] would actually heal you because they
[1336.00 - 1341.04] stop viruses and pathogens they have
[1339.00 - 1343.24] other things in
[1341.04 - 1345.20] them these Foods might not be able to
[1343.24 - 1348.32] park a car good and they might spread a
[1345.20 - 1350.04] bad rumor like how bad a tomato is it
[1348.32 - 1352.56] might spread because it's a night shade
[1350.04 - 1355.20] oh oh it might spread a
[1352.56 - 1356.48] rumor but it could actually heal you and
[1355.20 - 1359.00] stop
[1356.48 - 1361.48] viruses it might not be able to park its
[1359.00 - 1363.56] car good that rumor might go around and
[1361.48 - 1365.52] ruin all of its good just like it did
[1363.56 - 1368.76] that Mom where all the good she's ever
[1365.52 - 1371.44] done is thrown out the window thrown out
[1368.76 - 1373.52] the window because someone didn't like
[1371.44 - 1376.00] the way she parked her car they watched
[1373.52 - 1379.40] it they watched it and then they texted
[1376.00 - 1381.56] somebody and spread a rumor
[1379.40 - 1383.52] saying this mom is no good as a person
[1381.56 - 1385.44] and it ran around town somehow and
[1383.52 - 1386.76] nobody knew how it really developed and
[1385.44 - 1389.40] where it came
[1386.76 - 1391.32] from well that's the whole lectin thing
[1389.40 - 1395.68] that's like a
[1391.32 - 1398.16] tomato or a potato which stops
[1395.68 - 1400.00] viruses being blamed for all the real
[1398.16 - 1402.36] good it does because it actually stops
[1400.00 - 1404.88] real disease the real chronic illness
[1402.36 - 1406.76] that's out there it actually stops it
[1404.88 - 1409.64] because because just like the potato it
[1406.76 - 1411.72] has high amounts of available Eline a
[1409.64 - 1414.00] kind that no other food actually Harbors
[1411.72 - 1415.88] or has that actually stops the Epstein
[1414.00 - 1418.52] bar virus from causing chronic fatigue
[1415.88 - 1421.80] fibromyalgia Hashimoto thyroiditis and
[1418.52 - 1423.48] multiple sclerosis and the list goes on
[1421.80 - 1427.20] the list goes
[1423.48 - 1429.88] on but it's going to be packaged as a
[1427.20 - 1432.00] bad food for somebody to hang their hat
[1429.88 - 1434.36] on because it's an easy cell cuz people
[1432.00 - 1436.48] be like oh oh carbohydrate that's bad oh
[1434.36 - 1438.76] oh potato that's bad wait a minute sweet
[1436.48 - 1442.20] potato oh you got to look out
[1438.76 - 1444.52] out you got to look out and it's an easy
[1442.20 - 1447.24] cell because we're suckers in the end
[1444.52 - 1450.00] we're all suckers because it's easy to
[1447.24 - 1451.52] be a sucker when you don't know what's
[1450.00 - 1454.08] going on in science and research is
[1451.52 - 1455.64] keeping everybody in the dark to someone
[1454.08 - 1457.44] can come along and want to hang their
[1455.64 - 1458.88] hat on something and build an Empire off
[1457.44 - 1460.48] it in two seconds flat and you'll be
[1458.88 - 1461.84] suckered into it that'll be one more
[1460.48 - 1464.32] decade
[1461.84 - 1465.96] wasted so the prime example of entitled
[1464.32 - 1467.52] ignorance is the problem is first of all
[1465.96 - 1470.04] you don't recognize that so many people
[1467.52 - 1472.76] have healed I've seen lives saved with
[1470.04 - 1475.16] the potato literally saved even
[1472.76 - 1477.88] recently
[1475.16 - 1479.84] recently not even just years ago
[1477.88 - 1482.60] recently where they couldn't eat
[1479.84 - 1486.28] anything at all it was the only thing
[1482.60 - 1488.28] they could eat to recover their Linings
[1486.28 - 1490.84] of their intestinal tract from being
[1488.28 - 1493.48] burned out by food poisoning and burned
[1490.84 - 1494.96] out by other problems and adrenaline and
[1493.48 - 1496.20] everything else that people don't even
[1494.96 - 1498.00] understand how it works in the gut
[1496.20 - 1499.68] nobody knows what goes on in the gut you
[1498.00 - 1501.52] can give all the research and science
[1499.68 - 1504.04] about nobody knows what's going on in
[1501.52 - 1505.88] there because remember interest groups
[1504.04 - 1508.24] back each study that they're looking for
[1505.88 - 1510.92] and if there isn't an outcome to to
[1508.24 - 1513.08] soothe the Beast of the investors to
[1510.92 - 1514.80] sooe the investors you have to
[1513.08 - 1516.44] understand this there's an investor
[1514.80 - 1521.08] behind any
[1516.44 - 1524.44] study and so if an expert gets funded to
[1521.08 - 1526.52] create a study it has to have an outcome
[1524.44 - 1529.00] that's positive or they will never be
[1526.52 - 1532.52] invested in again you need to understand
[1529.00 - 1535.92] the the this the the level of what that
[1532.52 - 1539.36] is in which that is you need to know
[1535.92 - 1540.84] what that is it's real and that means an
[1539.36 - 1543.36] outcome's going to come out no matter
[1540.84 - 1544.72] who likes it who doesn't like it as long
[1543.36 - 1548.52] as it fits
[1544.72 - 1552.36] in to some narrative so you need to know
[1548.52 - 1553.96] this so prime example is not is for
[1552.36 - 1555.60] ignoring people that have healed
[1553.96 - 1557.20] removing foods that actually stop
[1555.60 - 1559.12] viruses and pathogens that are being
[1557.20 - 1560.24] ignored
[1559.12 - 1563.08] by
[1560.24 - 1566.88] arrogant people in the
[1563.08 - 1569.96] industry that cause real symptoms and
[1566.88 - 1572.60] disease lectin
[1569.96 - 1574.84] leaders don't know about these pathogens
[1572.60 - 1577.88] like Epstein bar they don't know the RO
[1574.84 - 1580.12] role in causing conditions and illnesses
[1577.88 - 1581.88] such as Epstein bar and the true which
[1580.12 - 1583.80] is the true cause of rheumatoid
[1581.88 - 1586.52] arthritis they would rather think a
[1583.80 - 1588.60] potato is causing somebody's ra than
[1586.52 - 1591.44] discover the truth
[1588.60 - 1594.16] that the cheese or the butter or the
[1591.44 - 1598.00] milk in potato mashed
[1594.16 - 1600.88] potatoes is actually feeding a virus not
[1598.00 - 1602.76] the potato itself they wouldn't they
[1600.88 - 1605.88] don't want to know that it's actually
[1602.76 - 1608.68] feeding a virus causing more
[1605.88 - 1611.00] ra you take that out the butter and you
[1608.68 - 1612.92] take out that you take out that lard and
[1611.00 - 1615.08] grease from a hash brown and you take
[1612.92 - 1616.64] out that butter from from you know off
[1615.08 - 1618.40] your potato and the cheese off your
[1616.64 - 1620.04] potato the very foods that feed
[1618.40 - 1622.84] pathogens and you just have a steamed
[1620.04 - 1624.60] potato you have a good chance to heal
[1622.84 - 1626.80] your
[1624.60 - 1629.08] ra because of what I was talking about
[1626.80 - 1631.08] earlier about the bioavailable LI scene
[1629.08 - 1634.96] involved that stops the Epstein bar
[1631.08 - 1637.52] virus from causing ra first of all letin
[1634.96 - 1640.44] leaders don't even know ra is caused by
[1637.52 - 1642.04] Epstein bar or any kind of pathogen or
[1640.44 - 1643.56] virus they think the body's attacking
[1642.04 - 1645.96] itself and destroying itself and then
[1643.56 - 1647.80] they think a food is causing it I can't
[1645.96 - 1649.80] tell you how remedial that is I can't
[1647.80 - 1651.56] tell you how basically stupid that is I
[1649.80 - 1653.36] can't even tell you to where we are
[1651.56 - 1656.20] today in this day and age that we would
[1653.36 - 1658.72] even be there still now today that we
[1656.20 - 1663.24] would even be here with that kind of
[1658.72 - 1665.16] unbelievable Joker ISM like it is
[1663.24 - 1666.56] incredible they'd rather believe that
[1665.16 - 1668.36] autoimmune is the immune system
[1666.56 - 1670.08] attacking the body's own cells and
[1668.36 - 1671.32] destroying itself since they don't
[1670.08 - 1673.68] understand that what the autoimmune
[1671.32 - 1675.24] theory that what it really is and how
[1673.68 - 1677.04] it's inaccurate they don't understand
[1675.24 - 1679.20] that they have nowhere else to turn
[1677.04 - 1681.44] besides blaming it on
[1679.20 - 1682.68] lectin and you know how important it is
[1681.44 - 1684.20] for somebody in their career to hang
[1682.68 - 1687.04] their hat on something you know how
[1684.20 - 1689.52] important that is it means everything it
[1687.04 - 1690.84] means everything okay hang your hat on
[1689.52 - 1692.84] something doesn't matter if it's going
[1690.84 - 1695.32] to hurt people harm people stop people
[1692.84 - 1697.96] from getting better if you can hang your
[1695.32 - 1701.08] hat on something that's what matters
[1697.96 - 1703.08] creates your legacy right hang your hat
[1701.08 - 1705.60] on something oh that's your
[1703.08 - 1708.88] legacy that's how it
[1705.60 - 1710.64] works all right
[1708.88 - 1712.04] and that's how people get wrapped up
[1710.64 - 1714.56] into the wrong
[1712.04 - 1716.52] direction believing in part that lectin
[1714.56 - 1718.44] are a problem because to supposedly
[1716.52 - 1720.36] confuse the body and cause it to turn
[1718.44 - 1721.72] against itself so okay lectin are the
[1720.36 - 1723.36] reason the body's are turning against
[1721.72 - 1725.40] itself first of all the body never turns
[1723.36 - 1727.80] against itself it can't turn against
[1725.40 - 1729.48] itself no lectin can make the body turn
[1727.80 - 1732.08] against itself nor can anything else
[1729.48 - 1735.28] make the body turn against
[1732.08 - 1739.96] itself a virus actually infects the
[1735.28 - 1741.60] body creating the inflammation your body
[1739.96 - 1743.76] creates an
[1741.60 - 1745.00] antibody whether it's discovered or Not
[1743.76 - 1746.40] by research and science because there's
[1745.00 - 1747.72] so many different antibodies that not
[1746.40 - 1749.64] not even discovered that the body
[1747.72 - 1753.92] creates to go after the pathogen and
[1749.64 - 1755.56] destroy it but only the pathogen itself
[1753.92 - 1757.16] this is Advanced information I'm giving
[1755.56 - 1758.92] you that doesn't exist out there
[1757.16 - 1760.76] Advanced information it's how I've
[1758.92 - 1763.12] gotten people to heal and still get
[1760.76 - 1766.08] people to heal I put it in my books I've
[1763.12 - 1768.64] worked with people oneon-one for
[1766.08 - 1770.40] decades and so we're still back in
[1768.64 - 1773.92] stupidity land I mean I have to say I
[1770.40 - 1777.24] hate saying that word but it's that
[1773.92 - 1778.56] bad so they believe that the lectin are
[1777.24 - 1780.40] the problem because they supposedly
[1778.56 - 1782.76] confuse the body and cause it to turn
[1780.40 - 1785.00] against itself while they remove the
[1782.76 - 1788.12] foods that can help you heal such as
[1785.00 - 1791.92] fruits and certain vegetables roots and
[1788.12 - 1795.32] tubers leading you to eat more fats that
[1791.92 - 1797.48] actually not only harm you but help feed
[1795.32 - 1799.12] the pathogens because they put you you
[1797.48 - 1802.08] on these really high-fat diets cuz
[1799.12 - 1804.48] they're so sugar feared they're so s
[1802.08 - 1806.28] such in fear of sugar they put you on
[1804.48 - 1808.60] these high-fat
[1806.28 - 1810.28] diets because they think oh wait wait a
[1808.60 - 1812.72] minute this is that's what they put you
[1810.28 - 1815.88] on and guess what that does it destroys
[1812.72 - 1817.80] your liver it destroys your liver and
[1815.88 - 1820.52] and and whether it's a they they all put
[1817.80 - 1822.16] you on the high animal protein diets but
[1820.52 - 1824.56] just say you want to be plant-based and
[1822.16 - 1828.08] follow their law You' have to be on tons
[1824.56 - 1831.64] and tons of of fats on a plant-based
[1828.08 - 1831.64] diet too which doesn't help your
[1832.24 - 1839.64] liver but understand this all The lectin
[1836.80 - 1840.88] Advocates and leaders and study grp and
[1839.64 - 1844.00] and and the people behind all the
[1840.88 - 1846.04] studies all these years they're anti-
[1844.00 - 1849.08] plant-based
[1846.04 - 1852.64] movement I'm not anti- plant-based
[1849.08 - 1855.68] movement I'm not anti- whatever animal
[1852.64 - 1857.60] protein movement but I'm not anti-
[1855.68 - 1860.76] plant-based movement they're an there's
[1857.60 - 1863.00] a bias there's a bias nature to it all
[1860.76 - 1865.92] they're anti fruit to begin
[1863.00 - 1869.24] with so you have to understand EV
[1865.92 - 1870.64] everybody involved in the lectin world
[1869.24 - 1874.04] the anti-lectin
[1870.64 - 1876.32] world everybody involved are all anti
[1874.04 - 1878.92] fruit to begin with they all bought into
[1876.32 - 1881.64] either the keto way or the high protein
[1878.92 - 1884.60] way they're totally against all
[1881.64 - 1887.24] plant-based modalities
[1884.60 - 1890.36] whatsoever and they're totally against
[1887.24 - 1893.80] fruit they're anti fruit to begin with
[1890.36 - 1896.24] so the whole thing is built with a bias
[1893.80 - 1898.80] against fruit itself do you know what
[1896.24 - 1900.24] that means you know what that means when
[1898.80 - 1902.28] you do a study it means you have a
[1900.24 - 1903.72] belief system already set in place and
[1902.28 - 1905.20] then you get funded for that belief
[1903.72 - 1906.80] system so of course it's going to come
[1905.20 - 1909.36] out in the way it's going to come out
[1906.80 - 1910.84] because guess what it can't go any other
[1909.36 - 1912.48] way especially when you don't even
[1910.84 - 1913.96] believe in Fruit when you think somebody
[1912.48 - 1915.80] shouldn't even be eating fruit because
[1913.96 - 1917.20] of the sugar and fruit don't even
[1915.80 - 1918.92] understand that fruits help heal dis
[1917.20 - 1922.12] disease they help heal the liver they
[1918.92 - 1924.76] help reverse disease in every way
[1922.12 - 1927.28] possible that's how it
[1924.76 - 1929.28] works so they end up removing the foods
[1927.28 - 1930.88] that heal you sure you might get
[1929.28 - 1932.92] temporarily results they take you off a
[1930.88 - 1934.84] processed food because it's not lectins
[1932.92 - 1937.12] and wheat it's another protein that
[1934.84 - 1941.20] actually causes problems and I'll tell
[1937.12 - 1945.56] you what it causes it feeds a virus
[1941.20 - 1948.32] lectins don't feed viruses but certain
[1945.56 - 1951.20] other types of protein and certain other
[1948.32 - 1953.08] types of phytochemicals that are
[1951.20 - 1956.32] actually in
[1953.08 - 1958.36] wheat can feed a virus they don't even
[1956.32 - 1960.80] know that they're so far removed from
[1958.36 - 1963.56] even researching that because your mind
[1960.80 - 1964.84] is shut and closed for so many reasons
[1963.56 - 1966.48] we just talked about throughout this
[1964.84 - 1967.80] whole show not even understanding that
[1966.48 - 1969.48] people have healed from chronic illness
[1967.80 - 1971.44] without their eltin their phony eltin
[1969.48 - 1973.00] belief
[1971.44 - 1975.68] systems
[1973.00 - 1976.88] so they put you on these high fat diets
[1975.68 - 1977.84] and they get rid of all fruit all
[1976.88 - 1979.44] together together the very thing that
[1977.84 - 1981.12] helps heal your liver and bring it back
[1979.44 - 1983.08] and guess what's in your liver viruses
[1981.12 - 1985.20] viruses that don't even know about
[1983.08 - 1986.80] viruses that sit inside the liver that
[1985.20 - 1988.32] the experts don't even know about that
[1986.80 - 1990.68] science and research aren't even aware
[1988.32 - 1993.12] about that sit there and those are the
[1990.68 - 1995.40] viruses that create inflammation and
[1993.12 - 1997.04] create chronic illness with all the
[1995.40 - 1999.04] illnesses and autoimmune diseases that
[1997.04 - 2001.44] we
[1999.04 - 2003.88] have the lectin and fruits and
[2001.44 - 2006.28] vegetables do not harm us I repeat the
[2003.88 - 2008.36] lectin in fruits and vegetables do not
[2006.28 - 2010.32] harm us please don't let any Source
[2008.36 - 2012.72] confuse you into thinking that lectins
[2010.32 - 2014.76] are like the toxic alkaloids produced as
[2012.72 - 2016.44] a defense mechanism by some wild plant
[2014.76 - 2018.24] not fit for human consumption let me go
[2016.44 - 2021.48] into that a little
[2018.24 - 2024.92] bit there are chotes and twigs in other
[2021.48 - 2028.12] plants where if a deer takes a bite a
[2024.92 - 2030.88] deer in the wild takes a bite alkaloids
[2028.12 - 2033.24] will surface to repel that deer in other
[2030.88 - 2035.96] animals and insects from damaging it
[2033.24 - 2039.00] further I repeat
[2035.96 - 2042.16] alkaloids not
[2039.00 - 2044.00] lectins alkaloids because what they
[2042.16 - 2046.76] throw at you they try to throw this
[2044.00 - 2049.20] other bogus piece of science too they
[2046.76 - 2050.92] try to say that well lectins what
[2049.20 - 2053.08] happens is when you're picking your
[2050.92 - 2055.32] vegetables and your
[2053.08 - 2058.80] fruits and you know whether they're in
[2055.32 - 2061.32] the wild or in your garden that the
[2058.80 - 2062.72] plant build a defense mechanism to stop
[2061.32 - 2064.96] you from eating
[2062.72 - 2066.96] them that's what that's what the that's
[2064.96 - 2068.52] what the argument is it's it's easy to
[2066.96 - 2069.48] buy into it it's really great you know
[2068.52 - 2072.44] what that's going to do it's going to
[2069.48 - 2074.60] stop you from eating your fruits and
[2072.44 - 2076.12] vegetables and other foods that could
[2074.60 - 2079.16] really help you it's going to stop you
[2076.12 - 2081.04] from doing that so then you can buy into
[2079.16 - 2083.12] the whole lectin thing and you'll end up
[2081.04 - 2084.92] sick anyway in 10 years because it's not
[2083.12 - 2086.84] the it's not what does it and gets rid
[2084.92 - 2088.44] of the viruses the very thing we talk
[2086.84 - 2090.36] about in the books and here on the radio
[2088.44 - 2094.36] show is to get people
[2090.36 - 2097.20] better it's a sad sad day when I have to
[2094.36 - 2100.72] I have to put out information to help
[2097.20 - 2103.52] clear the ear the air and actually help
[2100.72 - 2106.52] balance things back out again it's
[2103.52 - 2108.56] amazing how things work so what happens
[2106.52 - 2111.68] is is in the wild when a deer eats some
[2108.56 - 2113.12] leaves off of a chute or a root that
[2111.68 - 2114.00] came out of the I mean a chute that came
[2113.12 - 2117.36] out of the
[2114.00 - 2121.04] ground okay or it ate it ate some
[2117.36 - 2124.64] leaves off of a young a
[2121.04 - 2127.92] sapling it bit it bit some Twigs off of
[2124.64 - 2130.84] some Maples the maple will re release an
[2127.92 - 2134.48] enzyme an enzyme and an alkaloid to the
[2130.84 - 2137.84] surface to protect the tree from the
[2134.48 - 2139.96] deer that is not what our garden variety
[2137.84 - 2141.76] vegetables and fruits and wild edibles
[2139.96 - 2143.64] such as wild blueberries or other wild
[2141.76 - 2147.20] herbs that we use like red clover and
[2143.64 - 2149.84] everything else has that doesn't exist
[2147.20 - 2152.24] for human consumption humans can eat and
[2149.84 - 2153.52] choose to eat these there's a reason why
[2152.24 - 2155.12] these foods are on the planet and
[2153.52 - 2157.36] there's a reason why we grow them and
[2155.12 - 2158.92] it's a reason why we eat them and it's
[2157.36 - 2161.68] why they're here too and the fruits are
[2158.92 - 2164.40] on the trees naturally and here God
[2161.68 - 2166.04] given for us to actually heal and grow
[2164.40 - 2168.12] and feed
[2166.04 - 2171.20] ourselves it's
[2168.12 - 2175.56] different because a deer and a wild
[2171.20 - 2176.68] animal also has an enzyme in their mouth
[2175.56 - 2181.32] that
[2176.68 - 2183.68] triggers a wild twig a wild plant a
[2181.32 - 2187.96] sapling like for instance an
[2183.68 - 2190.92] alder or a baby maple or whatever kind
[2187.96 - 2193.52] of plant or just you know a wild herb
[2190.92 - 2195.84] coming out of the ground and so what
[2193.52 - 2198.32] happens is when that deer comes along
[2195.84 - 2200.12] and a deer bites this enzymes are
[2198.32 - 2202.80] released that the enzymes come out of
[2200.12 - 2205.76] the deer's mouth onto it it triggers
[2202.80 - 2209.48] these alkaloids to surface that doesn't
[2205.76 - 2212.44] exist with us when we grow green beans
[2209.48 - 2214.56] out of our garden when we grow um
[2212.44 - 2216.84] tomatoes out of our garden none of that
[2214.56 - 2219.04] exists this is such a disaster of how
[2216.84 - 2221.16] they can just spin everything it's
[2219.04 - 2223.00] amazing just spin it all spin it all to
[2221.16 - 2225.48] keep people from getting to where they
[2223.00 - 2226.88] need to go and where they need to do
[2225.48 - 2228.24] there are shoots and twigs and other
[2226.88 - 2229.84] plants where if a deer takes a bite
[2228.24 - 2231.52] alkaloids will surface to repel that
[2229.84 - 2233.04] deer and other animal and insects from
[2231.52 - 2235.28] damaging it further they're triggered
[2233.04 - 2237.72] off by a deer's enzymes in a deer's
[2235.28 - 2239.40] mouth we already don't eat those Foods
[2237.72 - 2241.52] we don't eat those types of foods
[2239.40 - 2242.92] they're toxic to us we already know
[2241.52 - 2246.20] you're not supposed to eat the very
[2242.92 - 2248.68] Foods in the wild that have these
[2246.20 - 2250.44] alcohol IDs that now experts try to
[2248.68 - 2252.52] trick us and say oh they're electons
[2250.44 - 2254.88] this just how you can throw anything out
[2252.52 - 2258.20] there anything out there you want to
[2254.88 - 2260.88] confuse people believe me that's what
[2258.20 - 2263.24] they do I know so you can do it you do
[2260.88 - 2265.16] it you do it I watch it all day long out
[2263.24 - 2267.96] there because they're backed by bias
[2265.16 - 2271.36] studies interest groups interest money
[2267.96 - 2273.84] investors investors somebody puts a half
[2271.36 - 2276.36] a million dollars into something you
[2273.84 - 2278.44] better have an outcome and the person
[2276.36 - 2281.24] who who you know sold it to them to get
[2278.44 - 2283.96] the money who has a belief system and
[2281.24 - 2286.36] who's anti- fruit better be delivering
[2283.96 - 2288.12] some kind of information to them even if
[2286.36 - 2289.84] it means don't look at everything else
[2288.12 - 2291.36] even it means ignore everything else
[2289.84 - 2293.32] even if it means ignore how many people
[2291.36 - 2296.56] have healed otherwise even if you would
[2293.32 - 2296.56] ever that's how it
[2296.80 - 2300.56] works so we already don't eat those
[2299.40 - 2303.56] foods that are in the wild because
[2300.56 - 2305.56] they're toxic to us and lectin aren't
[2303.56 - 2307.40] even what makes them a problem Garden
[2305.56 - 2309.20] variety fruits and veg vegetables and
[2307.40 - 2310.92] even the wild plants we know to be
[2309.20 - 2313.20] edible like I talked about before are in
[2310.92 - 2315.72] a whole different category they're not
[2313.20 - 2319.48] triggered we don't have an enzyme from a
[2315.72 - 2321.44] deer inside of us a deer that and yet
[2319.48 - 2324.20] they're being lumped together with
[2321.44 - 2325.92] problematic alkaloid containing plants
[2324.20 - 2328.04] again the lectins and the foods we eat
[2325.92 - 2330.48] do not cause harm the lectins and the
[2328.04 - 2333.12] foods we eat do not cause
[2330.48 - 2335.24] harm there are certain proteins that
[2333.12 - 2338.12] aren't in fruits and vegetables and are
[2335.24 - 2341.08] in items such as da eggs and certain
[2338.12 - 2343.24] grains like wheat and they do feed
[2341.08 - 2345.20] pathogens and people don't understand
[2343.24 - 2347.24] that part alone that part like there is
[2345.20 - 2350.68] worth the price of
[2347.24 - 2353.60] admission is worth the price of
[2350.68 - 2355.28] admission that alone what I mean by
[2353.60 - 2358.08] price of admission I mean you don't have
[2355.28 - 2360.56] to pay a price I'm just saying if you're
[2358.08 - 2363.20] going to go to a you know if you're
[2360.56 - 2365.48] going to go out and see a a movie and
[2363.20 - 2367.24] you're going to pay so much for a ticket
[2365.48 - 2370.80] hopefully it's worth a price of that
[2367.24 - 2373.00] ticket this alone is worth everything
[2370.80 - 2374.88] knowing that there's certain proteins in
[2373.00 - 2377.12] dairies Dairy and eggs and other
[2374.88 - 2379.68] phytochemicals undiscovered by research
[2377.12 - 2382.08] and science that feed
[2379.68 - 2384.48] pathogens viruses and bacteria that are
[2382.08 - 2387.16] creating the inflammation and guess what
[2384.48 - 2389.96] you guys lectins aren't one of them
[2387.16 - 2392.12] lectins are not one of them there are
[2389.96 - 2395.36] dozens of proteins and compounds and
[2392.12 - 2397.84] dairy and egg and Wheats and wheat for
[2395.36 - 2399.64] experts to hang dozens and dozens of
[2397.84 - 2402.52] hats on in their quest to alleviate
[2399.64 - 2405.16] chronic illness and yet they try to hang
[2402.52 - 2407.12] their hat on just one that's not even
[2405.16 - 2409.96] the problem they try to hang their hat
[2407.12 - 2411.80] on the lectin one it's utterly
[2409.96 - 2413.72] ridiculous be concerned about
[2411.80 - 2415.68] gluten-rich Foods absolutely and don't
[2413.72 - 2417.80] be but don't be afraid about potatoes
[2415.68 - 2420.80] and ripe Tomatoes I've watched them heal
[2417.80 - 2424.20] the sickest people as I said before
[2420.80 - 2427.20] saving even lives look out for
[2424.20 - 2430.40] anti-lectin sediment and be ious about
[2427.20 - 2432.68] buying into it this trendy mistake is
[2430.40 - 2434.24] going to continue for quite a long time
[2432.68 - 2436.04] it's here to stay because money has been
[2434.24 - 2439.32] invested into
[2436.04 - 2441.52] it so don't let it confuse you or
[2439.32 - 2443.48] confuse the bear with healing into the
[2441.52 - 2446.08] future it's another anti-f fruit
[2443.48 - 2448.84] campaign you have to know that they're
[2446.08 - 2452.20] going to hit the fruit in any way they
[2448.84 - 2453.72] can because the minute you gain a little
[2452.20 - 2455.08] power and you use the fear of The
[2453.72 - 2457.04] Nightshade of the Tomato which I'm going
[2455.08 - 2459.12] to talk about in a little while
[2457.04 - 2460.96] minute you grab that you can then if
[2459.12 - 2462.88] you're anti- fruit in general outside of
[2460.96 - 2464.00] a handful of berries if you're anti
[2462.88 - 2466.72] fruit in
[2464.00 - 2468.28] general you can you know you you then
[2466.72 - 2469.84] can use that you can wave that power
[2468.28 - 2471.32] once you have people's attention you can
[2469.84 - 2472.52] you can harness that power and be like
[2471.32 - 2473.88] yeah well you shouldn't be eating other
[2472.52 - 2475.36] fruits either because of all the sugar
[2473.88 - 2477.20] and everything else and whatnot and
[2475.36 - 2479.00] people be like whoa you must know what
[2477.20 - 2481.60] you're talking
[2479.00 - 2483.80] about so look it's another anti- fruit
[2481.60 - 2485.28] campaign another bias design to stop you
[2483.80 - 2487.28] from eating the fruits that heal your
[2485.28 - 2489.00] body and you're
[2487.28 - 2490.96] another excuse for medical research and
[2489.00 - 2492.60] science is lack of knowledge about what
[2490.96 - 2496.12] causes chronic
[2492.60 - 2499.20] illness please don't let it Rob you or
[2496.12 - 2501.52] your children of what you need to heal
[2499.20 - 2505.96] along the
[2501.52 - 2509.36] way see this as a beacon of light honest
[2505.96 - 2510.32] to God see it as a beacon of light today
[2509.36 - 2513.24] whatever you
[2510.32 - 2515.28] do it's really important see it is a
[2513.24 - 2516.92] beacon of light so let's talk about a
[2515.28 - 2519.72] little bit more
[2516.92 - 2521.24] about about about all of this are you
[2519.72 - 2523.04] guys hanging are you hanging with me are
[2521.24 - 2528.52] you with me you got some herbal tea with
[2523.04 - 2530.96] you so I hope so I hope so okay so how
[2528.52 - 2532.40] does this whole thing work in in other
[2530.96 - 2533.84] ways let's talk about some other stuff
[2532.40 - 2537.32] let's clear some other different things
[2533.84 - 2539.24] going on with all of this um okay let's
[2537.32 - 2542.84] go into the banana let's go into the
[2539.24 - 2545.88] banana fruit fear people anti-lectin
[2542.84 - 2547.24] people they don't like a ripe banana
[2545.88 - 2548.80] because they don't like ripe bananas
[2547.24 - 2551.16] because of because of sugar because
[2548.80 - 2554.12] they're concerned about sugar the only
[2551.16 - 2555.88] way to eat a banana is ripe you don't
[2554.12 - 2558.40] want it overripe but you don't want it
[2555.88 - 2560.84] under rpe it's the only way to eat one
[2558.40 - 2565.12] bananas have the ability when they're in
[2560.84 - 2566.68] their ripe stage to stop literally HIV
[2565.12 - 2570.28] the retrovirus
[2566.68 - 2573.56] HIV that's they can repel the retrovirus
[2570.28 - 2576.12] HIV they also have antiviral properties
[2573.56 - 2581.16] that that are incredible they've healed
[2576.12 - 2584.52] kill people with colitis colitis severe
[2581.16 - 2586.36] severe colitis ulcerative colitis
[2584.52 - 2589.32] hemorrhaging just hemorrhaging blood
[2586.36 - 2591.72] vessels bananas I've seen bananas turn
[2589.32 - 2594.60] people around with colitis because
[2591.72 - 2596.40] colius is viral not the body attacking
[2594.60 - 2598.60] itself here's a prime example of a
[2596.40 - 2600.00] mistake going on it's thrown into the
[2598.60 - 2601.64] autoimmune disease category because
[2600.00 - 2602.96] science research have no idea anything
[2601.64 - 2604.12] about it lectin people don't know
[2602.96 - 2606.32] anything about colitis they don't know
[2604.12 - 2608.28] anything about any autoimmune disease
[2606.32 - 2609.72] they don't the best lectin doctors don't
[2608.28 - 2610.80] know anything about best lectin
[2609.72 - 2613.12] scientists don't know anything about
[2610.80 - 2614.36] autoimmune disease of course not if they
[2613.12 - 2616.52] did they wouldn't know what it was they
[2614.36 - 2619.48] don't know what it is with colitis it's
[2616.52 - 2622.12] a virus and that virus sits inside the
[2619.48 - 2624.28] uh colon and it sits in the Linings of
[2622.12 - 2626.68] the colon and if you feed it the wrong
[2624.28 - 2628.12] Foods yes it eats and they don't know
[2626.68 - 2629.92] that either it eats and it eats the
[2628.12 - 2632.28] wrong Foods it'll eat dairy it'll eat
[2629.92 - 2633.72] eggs it'll eat like the other things I
[2632.28 - 2635.36] talked about that are in wheat and other
[2633.72 - 2637.16] grains and stuff like that it'll eat
[2635.36 - 2641.24] that
[2637.16 - 2644.44] and but when you put banana in it helps
[2641.24 - 2647.28] kill off the virus antiviral properties
[2644.44 - 2649.96] but lectin experts love to do the ripe
[2647.28 - 2651.48] the unripe banana the green banana I
[2649.96 - 2653.84] can't tell you how
[2651.48 - 2657.56] destructive that is to the intestinal
[2653.84 - 2659.00] tract a g solid rock hard green banana
[2657.56 - 2663.36] I'm just going to tell you right now
[2659.00 - 2667.12] unripe is so hard to digest so hard to
[2663.36 - 2670.08] digest it's unbelievable that's that and
[2667.12 - 2671.68] and but yet they like that as an option
[2670.08 - 2673.48] because they're so afraid of sugar
[2671.68 - 2675.52] because it hasn't it hasn't developed
[2673.48 - 2677.20] its sugars yet so they like taking the
[2675.52 - 2679.60] skin off don't do the don't do that
[2677.20 - 2681.48] green banana thing it's a way to really
[2679.60 - 2683.44] irritate your gut
[2681.48 - 2685.04] Linings because that's that's what
[2683.44 - 2686.36] happens when it's unripe like that you
[2685.04 - 2688.76] can't do that but when it's ripe it
[2686.36 - 2690.84] heals your gut Linings that's how it
[2688.76 - 2692.48] works this is just just a simple mistake
[2690.84 - 2694.88] already just a I mean it's not even
[2692.48 - 2696.76] simple it's a ridiculous mistake already
[2694.88 - 2698.08] being made out of the fruit fear out of
[2696.76 - 2700.76] the fear of sugar out of the fear of
[2698.08 - 2703.08] fruit causing harm it's
[2700.76 - 2706.24] unbelievable bananas soothe the
[2703.08 - 2709.36] intestinal tract lining they bring down
[2706.24 - 2712.16] inflammation do you know how by actually
[2709.36 - 2716.52] stopping pathogens that are causing
[2712.16 - 2719.56] inflammation so they bring down the
[2716.52 - 2723.32] inflammation I've seen bananas save
[2719.56 - 2725.56] lives over the years severe Crohn's and
[2723.32 - 2728.52] Colitis cases I've had to put them on
[2725.56 - 2731.76] nothing but bananas and celery juice not
[2728.52 - 2733.64] celery celery juice and and bananas to
[2731.76 - 2735.48] recover them to stop them from getting
[2733.64 - 2737.76] their intestinal tracks cut
[2735.48 - 2740.84] out and save their
[2737.76 - 2743.84] lives and they're living their lives
[2740.84 - 2746.16] now okay but entitled arrogance in the
[2743.84 - 2747.80] industries and the leading experts out
[2746.16 - 2750.12] there who think lactans is the cause of
[2747.80 - 2752.04] everything would even think that existed
[2750.12 - 2754.64] even if it was put in front of their
[2752.04 - 2756.96] face because if it didn't fit into their
[2754.64 - 2759.40] reasoning no no no no the world's the
[2756.96 - 2762.08] world stops for lectins it's like okay
[2759.40 - 2764.52] no everybody's sick it's because of the
[2762.08 - 2766.48] lectin everybody's sick that's it's
[2764.52 - 2768.24] lectin that's what it is now that's what
[2766.48 - 2769.92] it is
[2768.24 - 2772.64] unbelievable
[2769.92 - 2776.16] Tomatoes Tomatoes stop cancer banana
[2772.64 - 2778.36] stop cancer too but Tomatoes stop cancer
[2776.16 - 2780.12] but they just don't stop cancer they got
[2778.36 - 2782.92] a vitamin C in it different than any
[2780.12 - 2784.80] vitamin C there is and let me tell you
[2782.92 - 2786.48] about the whole Nightshade thing to
[2784.80 - 2790.36] begin with
[2786.48 - 2792.64] Nightshade all that means is it may
[2790.36 - 2796.36] Blossom sometimes a Nightshade May
[2792.64 - 2800.12] blossom in the Night Under The
[2796.36 - 2803.24] Moonlight if the moon is strong enough
[2800.12 - 2806.60] and when it does that fruit Harbors a
[2803.24 - 2810.00] vitamin C that's stronger than any other
[2806.60 - 2813.08] vitamin C tomato vitamin C is very
[2810.00 - 2814.96] powerful it stops viruses and pathogens
[2813.08 - 2816.92] do you know why tomato got a bad wrap
[2814.96 - 2819.36] because it was always with v
[2816.92 - 2822.92] Parmesan sauce you know it was the sauce

[2839.48 - 2843.52] and
[2840.44 - 2845.92] cheese of course no one so many people
[2843.52 - 2848.00] over the years reported they reported
[2845.92 - 2849.80] that they had some kind of reaction when
[2848.00 - 2853.16] they had their Pizza this in the old
[2849.80 - 2855.56] days they had a reaction when they had

[2855.56 - 2860.36] is with the sauce and everything their
[2857.80 - 2862.64] ravioli with the sauce and they the
[2860.36 - 2865.12] Tomato was always blamed on it because
[2862.64 - 2866.20] of a rumor spread about a tomato being a
[2865.12 - 2868.04] night shade so they were like well the
[2866.20 - 2871.68] cheese is in a night shade that's not a
[2868.04 - 2873.12] night shade that can't be hurting you um

[2885.40 - 2889.56] gluten in the crust that's not a night
[2887.44 - 2892.76] shade now we're all anti-gluten of
[2889.56 - 2895.88] course but this is how it got the wrap
[2892.76 - 2899.40] the bad wrap a fresh heirloom Ripe
[2895.88 - 2901.72] Tomato is so healing when it's thrown on
[2899.40 - 2904.00] top of a salad of
[2901.72 - 2906.52] spinach a little bit of

[3083.48 - 3088.00] Advocates started hating fruit la long
[3085.60 - 3091.44] ago before they even learned about
[3088.00 - 3093.92] lectin so lectin experts and Advocates
[3091.44 - 3096.40] didn't even know they didn't even know
[3093.92 - 3098.48] about lectin they didn't even know they
[3096.40 - 3100.52] just hated fruit to begin with they were
[3098.48 - 3101.84] anti fruit part of that anti- fruit
[3100.52 - 3104.92] movement when you listen to the fruit
[3101.84 - 3107.80] fear show part of the anti-m
[3104.92 - 3109.56] movement and I'm just telling you how
[3107.80 - 3112.68] this stuff
[3109.56 - 3114.84] happens so we're coming to the end of
[3112.68 - 3118.00] the show there's more to talk about with
[3114.84 - 3120.84] the Leon world because you know there's
[3118.00 - 3122.60] I I know there's more to talk about um
[3120.84 - 3124.04] first of all I'm going to do a gut
[3122.60 - 3125.72] health show another gut health show and
[3124.04 - 3127.08] talk about how leaky gut really works
[3125.72 - 3128.56] how it all works and they and they're
[3127.08 - 3129.92] trying to package lectin you're going to
[3128.56 - 3131.68] go everywhere they can now they're going
[3129.92 - 3133.76] to say lectin oh can help with the
[3131.68 - 3136.32] meaning can hurt leaky gut that's not
[3133.76 - 3138.48] even possible and I can't wait to go
[3136.32 - 3140.64] into that when we have a
[3138.48 - 3143.36] chance have you checked out the thyroid
[3140.64 - 3145.40] book check it out um just came out
[3143.36 - 3147.56] pretty recently actually recently it's
[3145.40 - 3151.28] it's it's in it's the beginning of being
[3147.56 - 3153.00] out there check it out and uh you know
[3151.28 - 3154.56] you can help people there's o over a
[3153.00 - 3156.76] hundred symptoms and conditions inside
[3154.56 - 3158.00] that book I explain what the causes are
[3156.76 - 3160.88] and they're not
[3158.00 - 3163.68] lectin they're not lectin the real
[3160.88 - 3166.76] causes of over a hundred different
[3163.68 - 3169.68] symptoms and conditions like across the
[3166.76 - 3173.08] board you got a symptom it's probably in
[3169.68 - 3175.28] there and it's not Leck and caused okay
[3173.08 - 3176.60] so just know that there's so many things
[3175.28 - 3177.76] things people suffer with so many
[3176.60 - 3180.32] different illnesses and chronic
[3177.76 - 3181.96] illnesses and yes it's tricky because if
[3180.32 - 3185.16] you get rid of gluten you might feel
[3181.96 - 3187.76] better because guess what wheat
[3185.16 - 3190.96] something in wheat like the gluten does
[3187.76 - 3193.88] feed pathogens which which is why you're
[3190.96 - 3197.56] not feeling good don't get that confused
[3193.88 - 3200.08] with the lectin propaganda and rhetoric
[3197.56 - 3202.60] that's out there now to try to rob you
[3200.08 - 3204.72] of healing do not get that confused
[3202.60 - 3206.56] whatever you do and that's going to be
[3204.72 - 3210.84] that a big mistake in your healing
[3206.56 - 3212.72] process a big mistake look it's easy to
[3210.84 - 3214.92] fall prey for what's out there now with
[3212.72 - 3217.84] information years ago when the internet
[3214.92 - 3219.60] wasn't around very few books existed in
[3217.84 - 3221.20] the health movement and I had this
[3219.60 - 3223.36] Advanced information that I'm giving you
[3221.20 - 3225.48] today and every day on this radio show
[3223.36 - 3227.08] every time I do the radio show Advanced

[3227.08 - 3232.72] years ago same Advanced information and

[3235.28 - 3240.48] the garbage that's out there and now
[3238.76 - 3242.24] that the garbage kept in growing growing
[3240.48 - 3243.84] growing like Spirit told me it would the
