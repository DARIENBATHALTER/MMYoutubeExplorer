00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,720
most advanced healing information

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,880
decades ahead of what's out there now

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
very important show we have going on

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,840
this is a big one right here it's all

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
about fasting all about fasting we're

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,040
going to be talking about fasting juice

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,520
fasting water fasting intermittent

14
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,800
fasting we're going to be talking about

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,840
dry fasting we're going to be talking

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,239
about all of it and it's it's a really

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,520
it's really an important show I think it

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,039
is because there's a lot of people doing

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,239
different kinds of things out there and

20
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,879
trying different kinds of things and and

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,199
are they good are they bad do they work

22
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:52,239
do they not work the whole bit

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
everybody's different we're going to

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
talk about why and how and what's the

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
safest way to go about things and and

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,399
what we can do so I mean this is really

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,840
a good show because um because there's a

28
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,400
lot of confusion out there and I want to

29
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,720
air out that confusion and I want to

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,720
make sure I want to make sure that

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,799
everybody has the best opportunity to

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,080
heal on all levels now what you're going

33
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,000
to find out is that I don't have this

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
belief system I'm not swallowed up into

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,040
a belief system that's that's also

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,960
supported with all kinds of excuse me

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
that's also supported with all kinds of

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,000
supplements that you know packages you

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,119
have to buy and you have to buy a

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,439
package from me or you have to buy you

41
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,920
know hey here's part of my fasting kit

42
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,280
here's part of my fasting thing oh here

43
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
you know do this do my fasting course

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,240
pay this pay $1,400 pay

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
$5,000 you know like you're not going to

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,719
get any of that from me there's nothing

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,399
there's no belief system sucked into a

48
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,880
moneymaking machine on this end so

49
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,759
that's something everybody needs to know

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,439
with all my shows all my information all

51
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,079
the information I put out everything

52
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,960
else and so it's very critical to

53
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,360
understand that I don't even sell my own

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,360
book it's a publisher book that's that's

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,759
the whole thing people know how it works

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,840
with books when when you have a

57
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,280
publisher and they go out and the

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,000
printing and everything else and all the

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,720
work involved and you know it's not the

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,280
same thing as if you publish yourself or

61
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,800
you have your own ebook and you make all

62
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,879
the money and all the stuff that people

63
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,280
do so there's there's really it's

64
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,040
important to understand when you're and

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
the reason why I'm saying all this is

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
because when you're dealing with fasting

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,560
and you're dealing with different belief

68
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,480
systems and Trends and different stuff

69
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,319
like that misinformation there's a lot

70
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,040
of stuff behind them they don't know

71
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,160
that's happen that you get tricked into

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,959
and you're not going to get that here

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
you're going to get literally you're

74
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,120
going to get you know the truth the

75
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,360
information that's not swallowed

76
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,280
swallowed up by some investor or some

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,040
belief system or somebody invested into

78
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,959
like you know $500,000 in supplements

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
and put all these kits together so they

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,239
can tell you how to dry fast and then

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,640
make sure you take these herbs and make

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,280
sure you take this and make sure you

83
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,360
take that and then they try to train you

84
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,000
to also be one of these people so then

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,360
you go it's like a pyramid scheme and

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,560
you go and try to get other people on

87
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,400
board and whatever nothing like that

88
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
nothing like that is happening and on

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,799
the beginning of the show you'll notice

90
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,040
there isn't a 15minute infomercial on

91
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,760
selling kind of some kind of diet system

92
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,120
or selling kind of some belief system or

93
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,760
some whatever you're not going to hear

94
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
that either and I have to just make that

95
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,560
clear for anybody who first came on here

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
who's never heard the medical medium

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,640
radio show it's all about you and that's

98
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,040
what it's really about and that's what

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
it's really really really about it's

100
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,959
about your healing process about your

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,239
family it's about your loved ones it's

102
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,680
about the people you care about it's

103
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,000
about all of that and you just you know

104
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,319
what happens is we get so brainwashed by

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,159
all all the propaganda and all the sales

106
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:44,280
and all the systematic selling of things

107
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,120
and products and belief systems and diet

108
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,519
systems and all this other stuff that we

109
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,439
just get numb to it and then we think

110
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,799
everybody does that that's that's a

111
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,120
public figure or somebody who's out

112
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:55,040
there whatever it is we think everybody

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
does that it's not true we don't do that

114
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,720
here I don't do that and that has to be

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
clear so when it comes down to fact

116
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,360
fasting and water fasting and dry

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,040
fasting and intermittent fasting or any

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,200
kind of fasting whatever it is you just

119
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,920
know it's free what we're talking about

120
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,239
is free from some you know Bowl that's

121
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840
behind it from some some agenda that's

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,199
behind it so you always have to know

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,919
that and that's important that's really

124
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:21,519
important to understand so look let's

125
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,280
get into the show let's do this I think

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,080
I've you know held you guys out enough

127
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,400
with that right now and I just I just

128
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,720
you know it's just it's important stuff

129
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,320
believe me is important you need to know

130
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,160
that the information you get is free

131
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,160
from you know something that shouldn't

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
be involved in it it's just it's just

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,639
it's really it would matter to me it

134
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,479
would matter to me so if I was looking

135
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,800
for help it would matter to me so I so I

136
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
I Pro so I'm just thinking I'm assuming

137
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,120
that would matter to everybody else too

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,759
um so so here's the bottom line here's

139
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,400
the bottom line there's all these

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,840
different fasts out there and and all

141
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,280
these different programs and all these

142
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,280
different kits and all this different

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,240
stuff

144
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,919
and there's really no there's nothing

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,560
behind this as far as you know when you

146
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,919
think about the different there's

147
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,039
there's not there's there's people's

148
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:14,120
theories there's uh theories there's you

149
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,560
know belief systems there's things that

150
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,800
people tried on themsel and it might

151
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,120
have worked for them but it didn't work

152
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
for somebody else there's a lot of

153
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,800
things mixed up and matched into it and

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,160
you got to be careful um you know with

155
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,919
Liver Rescue with Liver Rescue uh my

156
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,800
latest book Liver Rescue I talk about

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,479
how the liver doesn't like to be pushed

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,479
it doesn't like to be pushed it's like a

159
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,800
child about to jump into the swimming

160
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,000
pool off the diving board for the first

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,120
time ever and is standing um at the end

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,639
of the diving board okay standing there

163
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,360
and getting the courage and getting the

164
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,000
the faith and the courage and getting

165
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,520
that willpower and building that Spirit

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,639
to want to make that plunge on her or

167
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,280
his own and jump into the water you know

168
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,080
and and that child if you got on the

169
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,759
diving board and you pushed the child in

170
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,440
without the child realizing or knowing

171
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,280
it and the child was thrown into the

172
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,039
water and got a gulp of water and was

173
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,919
choking and gasping on the water on the

174
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,240
side of the pool and all trust would be

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,560
broken all trust would be broken it

176
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,479
would be it would be a pushed event or a

177
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,080
forced event when it shouldn't be it

178
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,360
should be something that naturally

179
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,240
occurs with the child's own you know

180
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,039
being and Consciousness and everything

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,039
else to jump off that diving board for

182
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,840
the first time into a swimming pool you

183
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,240
know and I remember I remember being a

184
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,759
child and I was I was you know I was at

185
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,599
a a friend's house and there was

186
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,160
everybody was swimming there and I was I

187
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,199
was um 8 years old and I remember that's

188
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,960
what happened and I saw that I saw a

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,440
child that was on the diving board for

190
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,240
the first time ever a little girl and

191
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,240
she was she was on the diving board and

192
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,400
an adult was behind her and then pushed

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
her in just pushed her in thought that

194
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,360
that would be the best way to do it and

195
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,479
I'll never forget it because I I was I I

196
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,199
saw it was wrong totally wrong and I

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
knew why it was wrong in every way and

198
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,680
um and spirit did knew why it was wrong

199
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,160
in every way and I'll never forget that

200
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,000
and I I and I and I talked about that in

201
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Li rescue because what happens is when

202
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,360
you cleanse and you fast you may be

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,479
pushing a part of your body that doesn't

204
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
want to be pushed and that is really

205
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,360
what happens and we have to be careful

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
so when we're we're doing different

207
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,240
fasts and we just we're trying different

208
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
things and we're going jumping into

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,160
things we don't know what our organs are

210
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,520
feeling we have no idea and have no clue

211
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,080
you know which organ is that little girl

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,560
on the end of the diving board that gets

213
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,639
thrown into the water instead of having

214
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,639
to do the process properly or the right

215
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,720
process of jumping in and building up

216
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,240
you know building up that faith and

217
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,879
everything else and you know would

218
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,560
happen in that trust and what happens is

219
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:02,800
there's an organ in our body called the

220
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,400
liver and that liver of ours and yours

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,680
doesn't like stupid fasting meaning

222
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,120
stupidly done fasting it doesn't like it

223
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,039
at all and a and it's really important

224
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,720
to know this because no one knows what's

225
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,120
happening inside the body out there it's

226
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,560
amazing what happens I mean it's just

227
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,560
got tons of practitioners out there and

228
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,520
doctors and all these different people

229
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,560
and and what not and no one really knows

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,240
what's happening inside the body it's

231
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,800
all hit or miss out there it really is

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
and that's that's what's scary so so but

233
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,599
this organ that we have which is the

234
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,680
liver it it doesn't like to be what it

235
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,320
does is it holds on to poisons for a

236
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,800
reason it holds on to toxins for a

237
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,920
reason and if it's pushed too hard it's

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,839
going to release all of them not all of

239
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,760
them a large amount of them into the

240
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,040
bloodstream and it's not going to leave

241
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,040
your body it's not it's only some are

242
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,040
going to leave the body the rest are

243
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,959
going to float around cause causing harm

244
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,600
and they're going to float around

245
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,160
causing harm to the brain they're going

246
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,040
to float around causing harm to the

247
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,560
pancreas and they're going to float

248
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,880
around causing harm to the spleen

249
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,880
they're going to float around causing

250
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,360
harm to other parts of the body to the

251
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,839
nervous system especially and they're

252
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
even going to float around causing harm

253
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,000
to the adrenals so when it's about

254
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,959
cleansing no one's thinking about

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,560
something inside of them no one's

256
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,200
thinking about that whatever kind of

257
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,880
cleansing it is meaning whatever kind of

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,839
cleansing whatever kind of fast whatever

259
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,360
kind of whatever it is no one's thinking

260
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,200
about wait a minute you know what is my

261
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,760
liver really going to do and how does my

262
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,880
liver really work and what's really

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,320
happening here and this is why we have

264
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,720
so many mistakes in the industry and and

265
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,360
and people get sucked into so many

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
things and yeah some things work some

267
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,200
things don't but

268
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
regardless everybody's different

269
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
something might work for someone someone

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,760
someone might something might not work

271
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,920
for another person I'm going to I'm

272
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,680
going to talk about that I'm going to

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,600
discuss all that and talk about that as

274
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,959
we're going through the show um so what

275
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,000
happens is our liver likes to release a

276
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:07,920
certain amount of poison that it doesn't

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,320
have to soop back up so what happens is

278
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,079
if we push it and we just jump into some

279
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,399
fast or we do something like a dry fast

280
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,120
or we do something whatever Poison's

281
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,160
been inside our liver it you know

282
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,600
everything all the different chemicals

283
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,640
all the different toxins all the

284
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,480
different heavy metals all the different

285
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,399
solvents Pharmaceuticals all throughout

286
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,920
life from starting from the beginning

287
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:32,399
everything that's in there and then some

288
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,720
pesticides DDT herbicides that believe

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,480
it it the liver has it all in there

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,399
Plastics petroleum tons of petroleum

291
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,720
based stuff I mean it's amazing what's

292
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,560
inside the liver and so if we the liver

293
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
just likes to release a little bit of

294
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,279
this at a time and a little bit of this

295
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
at a time and that's why you know spirit

296
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,680
and you know gave me the 28 day cleanse

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,160
so it releases a little bit at of the

298
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,440
time a little bit at a time because what

299
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,639
happens is if you jump into some crazy

300
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,760
fast

301
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,360
yeah I know some of you are probably

302
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,120
like upset because you you're in totally

303
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,399
into fasting and you still can fast but

304
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,959
I'm going to talk about why we have to

305
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,920
be careful in different levels and and

306
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,560
different things for different people if

307
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,920
you're toxic if you're ready already

308
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,480
really really toxic fasting is not what

309
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,959
you want to do meaning water fasting

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,560
straight water fasting um dry fasting um

311
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,040
you know you've got to be really careful

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,440
because what happens is if you have a

313
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,519
really toxic liver and it's f and it's

314
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,320
sluggish and it's loaded with poison and

315
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,920
you push that liver off the diving

316
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,600
board okay when you push it off the

317
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
diving board into the

318
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,720
pole there's going to be a problem

319
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,959
there's going to be a major problem it's

320
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,360
going to release too much poison even

321
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,440
though it's not going to release all of

322
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,880
it there's no way because it's it's it

323
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
because when livers are toxic they're

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,959
loaded and it takes takes takes a lot

325
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
while to get your livers cleaned up I'm

326
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,360
going to tell you right now and I talk

327
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,000
all about that in Liver Rescue but what

328
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,480
happens is

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,079
that the liver will release more poison

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,160
than it wants to release and then that

331
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:10,839
poison won't leave the body only a

332
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,519
little bit will hit the kidneys and

333
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,839
leave the body the rest of it will wreak

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,120
havoc what I mean wreak havoc it will

335
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:21,079
get into the brain it will get into the

336
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,800
nervous system and it will get into the

337
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,800
pancreas it'll get into places and and

338
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,839
on top of that the liver has to sop it

339
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:34,120
all back up it has to work 10 times

340
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,880
harder to stop all that toxic poison

341
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,399
poisonous debris back up cuz the liver

342
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,880
has to suck it all back up and that's

343
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:45,920
that's you know that's how it works so

344
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,639
we have to be we have to be responsible

345
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,360
which I just don't see that out there

346
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,199
with all the different Frills and chills

347
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,160
packages all the different fasting stuff

348
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,560
all the different whatever it's

349
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,279
literally it's literally like I mean

350
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,800
it's unbelievable on how not

351
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,800
responsible it is out there so so the

352
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,959
bottom line is it's all about protecting

353
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,320
something when you're fasting and I'm

354
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,720
going to tell you how to do it I'm going

355
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,920
to tell you what you should do you know

356
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
depending and everybody's a little

357
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,519
different so I'm going to try to give

358
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
you as much information on the

359
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,440
differences you may have yourself that

360
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,160
can you know that can be the difference

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
there now to begin with if you're really

362
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,920
toxic you've been eating standard

363
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,920
American for the most part you haven't

364
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,320
really done any fruits and vegetables

365
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
you've been eating a lot of animal

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,000
products or you even been eating a lot

367
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,160
of animal products and still eating

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,600
fruits and vegetables and you're not

369
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,199
eating that you know bad and you're

370
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,839
eating pretty clean you still could be

371
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,639
highly toxic toxic for years and years

372
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,920
and years the liver could be totally

373
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,279
filled with tons of poison because

374
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,839
that's what that's the organ that gets

375
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,360
filled with that much poison and then

376
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,800
someone convinces you to go on some

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,880
fasting program

378
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,320
wrong wrong to do wrong to do what

379
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
you'll do is you'll just you'll hurt the

380
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,519
adrenals you'll you'll you'll saturate

381
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,320
the brain with poison which the brain

382
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
does not need you'll weaken the pancreas

383
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,360
and you'll over tax and over stress and

384
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,920
overwork the liver and make it harder

385
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,759
for the liver to heal later so what

386
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,759
happens is we have to do things a little

387
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,320
differently you know like the 28 day

388
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,000
cleanse in the first book medical media

389
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
I mean 28 day cleanse is because that

390
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,240
that is to make sure that anybody who is

391
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,440
already healthier gets even healthier

392
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,800
and cleaner so that if they did do a

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
fast or a two-day water fast or a 7-Day

394
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,560
water fast or they did something it

395
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,519
wouldn't be a disaster and it wouldn't

396
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,160
be it wouldn't be hard on the liver it

397
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,040
wouldn't be super hard on the liver and

398
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,519
so that's something to really understand

399
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,480
and so what happens though if you're if

400
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,079
you're toxic and you're coming into

401
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,440
you're coming into something say you're

402
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,720
just you've been eating the way you're

403
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
eating and that's how you've been eating

404
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,279
all these years it's not that good you

405
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
got or you're or you've been eating

406
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,720
pretty good but your liver's loaded and

407
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,519
nobody knows nobody knows and your liver

408
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,759
loaded with poison loaded with toxins

409
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,759
and and and then you go and you jump

410
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,959
into a

411
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,199
fast and and that's not what you do

412
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,000
that's not what you should do and in the

413
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:10,839
end you know we get hurt because of that

414
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,279
later on in different ways it's in and

415
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,800
so I mean that's that's kind of an

416
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,720
example right there there's something

417
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,880
about gradually eating better and better

418
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,759
and better gradually eating better and

419
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,839
better and better so you know so you

420
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:29,120
don't end up so there's this you adapt

421
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,240
so your liver can actually adapt so so

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,240
and that's the key that's one of the big

423
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,800
keys let say you're somebody who's been

424
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,519
doing everything you've been doing all

425
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
these different foods but have you been

426
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,600
doing everything have you been doing

427
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,680
celery juice for 5 years have you been

428
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,440
doing celery juice for three years have

429
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,160
you I mean think about it totally

430
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,399
cleansing recovering your pancreas

431
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,519
totally cleansing recovering your your

432
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,880
your spleen totally cleansing recovering

433
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,360
your uh liver your nervous system you

434
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,720
know what's funny is there's people out

435
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,839
there there's so many people now that

436
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,240
have um that have the the medical medium

437
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,160
books go around the world right you're

438
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,720
probably bumping into them and stuff and

439
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,079
and you know and at the same time is

440
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,880
people hop on board on the internet

441
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,079
they'll hop on Instagram they'll hop on

442
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,639
Facebook or they'll hop on different

443
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,480
forums and oh yeah no I tried that it

444
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,000
wasn't really helping but when you look

445
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,079
at it I mean you look at it they didn't

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,759
even do the celery juice for two weeks

447
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,839
what did they try you know what happens

448
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,199
every day I see it out there and you

449
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,600
know did someone do 32 oz of celery

450
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,639
juice for the liver for their body for

451
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,680
their health and you know or even 16

452
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,880
ounces of celery juice every single

453
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,000
morning for a year did they and remove

454
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,759
the no Foods remove the eggs the dairy

455
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,800
the wheat and you know other things like

456
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,160
that did they do that and you know like

457
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,360
so that's the whole point is there's

458
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,199
different way there's different levels

459
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,440
of getting to a point where if you want

460
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,440
to do a fast were you doing at least the

461
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,160
other things to get yourself ready for

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,880
one so what I'm saying is is if you if

463
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,839
you get tied into some fast out there

464
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,439
tied into some cleanse tied into

465
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,959
something and it's selling you a bag of

466
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,600
goods and it's making you buy like

467
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,199
thousands of dollars of stuff and then

468
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,160
telling you you can sell thousands of

469
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,799
dollars of stuff whatever it's doing you

470
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,360
know some do that some don't some just

471
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,360
make you buy stuff some whatever whether

472
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,319
it's by you know uh crazy people that

473
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,760
created the cleanse some mad man that

474
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,520
created the cleanse whatever it is

475
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,199
that's out there whatever you're doing

476
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:29,080
out there make sure you get yourself

477
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,799
ready for it because if it's not a good

478
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,960
cleanse and if it's not a good fast if

479
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,480
it's not a good situation you got your

480
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,840
body in a place that could possibly

481
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,240
adapt to it and protect you and the

482
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,200
whole thing about the medical medium

483
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
information and what what uh spirit and

484
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,440
I been doing is making sure you have all

485
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
the foundation to protect you to heal no

486
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,880
matter what you do so even if you make

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
mistakes even if you fall into a belief

488
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,520
system even if you fall into something

489
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,080
even if you whatever you'll be better

490
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,919
off and still safer because because it's

491
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,720
it's all about protecting things inside

492
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,200
the body that nobody understands and I'm

493
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,280
just saying this because it's got look I

494
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,840
got to tell I got to say the truth

495
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,320
that's all I have that's all I have to

496
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,880
do you know Spirit told me so was a

497
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,159
little little boy just tell the truth

498
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,200
just tell the truth and the truth is

499
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,159
this information and say it and don't be

500
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,640
afraid to say it so I promise Spirit

501
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,039
since the day day day I got the the gift

502
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
and spirit was talking to me that I'm

503
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:22,200
always going to say it like it is and

504
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,360
not be afraid of hurting someone's

505
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,720
feelings and that was the key I remember

506
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,120
when I was a little boy I'd be like well

507
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,679
I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings if

508
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,159
I if I tell them what you're telling I'm

509
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,840
going to hurt their feelings because

510
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,039
they believe in something else spirit

511
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,360
said doesn't matter you have to tell

512
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:38,919
them what it is they have to hear the

513
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,799
truth and so and so with the fasting

514
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,240
thing you know it's important to know

515
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,880
that if you're yeah if you're really

516
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,080
highly toxic if your liver is really

517
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,200
overburden which most likely probably

518
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,760
especially if you've been sick for a

519
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,679
long time and you got viral issues and

520
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,360
everything inside the liver you want to

521
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,880
you want to do something like a 28 day

522
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,400
cleanser you want to do the cleanse and

523
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,840
Liver Rescue you want to do the cleanse

524
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
and Liver Rescue so you'll see the

525
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,280
cleanse and Liver Rescue it's it it

526
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,799
literally is above the rest because it's

527
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,280
it's about making sure your liver gets

528
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,880
cleaned up to the end like cleaned clean

529
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,159
cleaned up without hurting your liver

530
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,280
hurting your bloodstream and everything

531
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:15,360
else okay so let's go into some some

532
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:18,080
water fasting talk okay have I water

533
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,120
fasted have I water fasted yes I have

534
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,120
have I water fasted a long time yes I

535
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,360
have I've water fasted an extremely long

536
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,799
time one that probably is way too

537
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,159
dangerous for so many people you know

538
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,840
you know I I when I water fasted for a

539
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,440
long I did a lot of water fast in my day

540
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,080
and I did water fast for Spiritual

541
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,799
reasons okay and you know with with

542
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,640
struggling with spirit and struggling

543
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,720
with with with having what what I called

544
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,200
the curse all these years which was the

545
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,600
gift of hearing spirit so I you know I

546
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,039
did spiritual fasts with um with water

547
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,840
fasting you know throughout my life

548
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,240
starting at age 12 I you know my first

549
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,200
water fast was at age 12 I water fasted

550
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,080
for 7 days straight with just water at

551
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,640
age 12 I'm not recommending that I'm not

552
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,799
and no 12-year-old should be doing that

553
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,039
okay I did it I was lucky I had Spirit

554
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,760
okay so I had spirit to guide me and I

555
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,400
had Spirit to also tell me I I shouldn't

556
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,480
have been doing it either but I did it

557
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,520
anyway but I had Spirit guiding me and

558
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,600
helping me through it I did a 7-Day fast

559
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,600
at 12 years old okay okay at 18 years

560
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,840
old I did a 21-day fast at 18 years old

561
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,679
of straight water and I'm not even going

562
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,280
to tell you how many days I've done even

563
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,400
after that because I don't want to

564
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,320
influence anyone thinking they could

565
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,360
water fast too long okay but I have done

566
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,960
longer than 21 days in water fasting and

567
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,880
I mean a lot longer and it's stupid it

568
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,559
was stupid and I was spiritually doing

569
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:59,760
it for my own emotional spiritual

570
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,640
reasons being a human being and uh and

571
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,120
at the same time dealing with what I had

572
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,840
to deal with growing up which was you

573
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,159
know which was with spirit so it was

574
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,320
pretty intense time for me now have I

575
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,200
helped people water fast over the water

576
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
fast over the years if people you know

577
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,440
would come to me and they really truly

578
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,919
wanted to and they wanted me to guide

579
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,279
them I have helped people so they

580
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,520
wouldn't make mistakes or it was the

581
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,159
right thing for them or the right way

582
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,919
for them you know I've seen all that is

583
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,400
water fasting okay some water fasting is

584
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,200
okay for people some sometimes it is but

585
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,679
I like water fasting for people that

586
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,360
have already gotten to a certain point

587
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,240
you know so the liver isn't traumatized

588
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:44,240
so they've already been eating good I've

589
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,520
been eating good since I was 8 years old

590
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,279
and that's how long I've been eating

591
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,760
good even a little before that but

592
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,320
around 8 years old so I've been eating

593
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,080
clean since 8 years old and that eating

594
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,159
clean since 8 years old has allowed me

595
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,039
to keep my liver clean so I'm giving you

596
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,559
a little bit of private information

597
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:00,880
information about me because you know I

598
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,840
always want to tell you guys everything

599
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,159
about me but every time I talk about me

600
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,320
then everybody starts yelling on the

601
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,480
internet stop talking about yourself and

602
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,679
talk about talk about you know us and

603
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,360
our problems and our illnesses so I try

604
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,559
not to excuse me I try not to talk about

605
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,760
myself so

606
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:22,320
much so so the whole thing is is that is

607
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,679
that when you when you're getting to a

608
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,840
point of being clean enough and you're

609
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,240
cleaning out your liver and you're

610
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,520
cleaning out your body and cleaning out

611
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,400
your organs and your bloodstream and

612
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,240
everything's coming out of you enough

613
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,760
gradually over time cuz you've been

614
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:39,320
eating good for a while what happens is

615
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,960
you know you can do things like that for

616
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,760
your health so if you were sick or you

617
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,320
had a problem or something happened and

618
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,799
you want to heal something quicker or a

619
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,799
sickness comes over you and you want to

620
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,480
heal something quicker you catch

621
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,559
something you catch somebody's strap a

622
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,960
caucus you catch somebody's you catch

623
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,840
somebody's you know whatever or you just

624
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,760
you know you get a bad flu or whatever

625
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,159
happens in your life you know you want

626
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,520
to be able to also be able to fast but

627
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,600
you don't want to be Force forcing your

628
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,799
liver and forcing yourself into such a

629
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,279
such a difficult situation where your

630
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,320
body's fil filling up with so many

631
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,360
toxins and poisons that you get affected

632
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,840
by it in negative ways and believe me it

633
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,360
can so so if you're someone who wants to

634
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:24,279
water fast I support it I don't support

635
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,919
long water fasts I don't think they're

636
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,320
necessary because a lot of people go

637
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:32,320
into fasts water fasts being

638
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,559
nutritionally deficient being completely

639
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,200
deficient with deficient of zinc

640
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,559
deficient of different minerals but yet

641
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,080
they're sick and they have viruses so

642
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:44,159
what happens is when you water fast too

643
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,000
long your immune system starts to weaken

644
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,159
and viruses like the shingles and the

645
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,840
EBV and hhv sixs and the cytom magler

646
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,600
viruses and all the herpetic viruses

647
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
that create Lyme disease that create all

648
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,679
these different illnesses that I talk

649
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,679
about all the time in my books and

650
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,360
everything else all these viruses have a

651
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,919
way of being able to jump out and and

652
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,200
come out I know fast fasting experts

653
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,400
that don't even understand how viruses

654
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,640
work and how how viruses affect and make

655
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,520
people sick and they fast their people

656
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,120
and and these people come out of fasts

657
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,120
and some of them can can all of a sudden

658
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,600
get really sick and they got a whole

659
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,440
thing of shingles running down their

660
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,840
side a whole thing of this going down

661
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,200
after it it's like doesn't and they're

662
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,480
always like oh it's cuz you're cleansing

663
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,720
you're cleansing you're cleansing no cuz

664
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,799
you went into a deficient you've been

665
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,840
sick all this time you went into a

666
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,320
deficient and you know you're you're

667
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,799
mineral deficient your other kinds of

668
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,080
deficiencies and then you fasted and it

669
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,399
was just too hard in the system the

670
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,880
immune system took a little bit of a hit

671
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:49,080
and so you know so there's different so

672
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:53,600
I support water fasting I do you know

673
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,440
but it has to be it has to be not too

674
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,679
long for certain people there's some

675
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,039
people they could do it a little bit

676
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,880
longer some people people shorter you

677
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,640
know what I like for water fasting is

678
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,919
like a two-day water fast the most I

679
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,600
like two-day water fasts if someone

680
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,440
really wants to do one 2day is actually

681
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,120
perfect it doesn't freak out the liver

682
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,679
to such a degree where the LI is

683
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,200
actually dumping everything at once and

684
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,080
then having to pay the price by sucking

685
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,760
it all back up and then weakening itself

686
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,360
and getting sluggish afterwards because

687
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,840
that's what happens some people who fast

688
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,279
and they fast for a while regardless of

689
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,159
what kind of fast they shock the liver

690
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,799
so much that they gain weight after

691
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,559
they're fast later on regardless of what

692
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,480
diet they're on and everything like that

693
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,720
they gain all their weight like all this

694
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,080
weight because they liver totally took a

695
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,279
hit from the F fast so you don't want it

696
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,520
so two days I like it's a more

697
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,360
protective to the liver depending on who

698
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
you are it's more protective it's more

699
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,159
safer it's more better so it would be a

700
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,279
two-day water fast and you have to be

701
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:53,679
drinking water you have to be drinking

702
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,520
water so you know so I like those

703
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,000
because you can do a two-day water fast

704
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,919
and I don't want you doing a two-day

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,600
water fast while driving around dropping

706
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:04,039
the kids everywhere dropping the kids

707
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,840
off everywhere um going here going there

708
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:10,480
you should never in in in my opinion and

709
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,559
in in my experience when you water fast

710
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,960
you might get a dizzy spell some toxins

711
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,760
might come out your blood sugar is going

712
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,520
to drop you're going to you might get

713
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,159
weak you might get all these different

714
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,799
things now I know there's supersonic

715
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,600
people out there that can water fast for

716
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,640
3 days and they're like oh my God I feel

717
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,399
great and they're driving around in

718
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,799
their car they're driving around in the

719
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:29,960
car but still anything could happen so

720
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,840
it's the kind of thing where you do your

721
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,200
two-day water fast on the weekend you do

722
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,520
it at home and you know you you can you

723
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,440
know do what you need to do while you're

724
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,520
doing it some you know and that's okay

725
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,159
now here's the deal when you're dealing

726
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,880
with neurological problems people that

727
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,799
have neurological illnesses and they

728
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,640
they're really weak nervous systems and

729
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,039
because of EBV and neurotoxins floating

730
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,240
around in the bloodstream things that

731
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,799
fasting experts don't even know about

732
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,760
they don't even have an idea about all

733
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,559
that kind of stuff and so so what

734
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,919
happens is once you have all that and

735
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,880
you do a fast it could be really hard on

736
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,440
somebody's central nervous system could

737
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,919
shut down their central nervous system

738
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,200
weaken it so that when they come out of

739
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,640
the water fast they're they have to work

740
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
20 times harder that's why I don't like

741
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,159
long water fasts because so many PE

742
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,960
people have neurological issues they

743
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,799
have anxiety they have depression they

744
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,159
have headaches these are all

745
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,120
neurological they have fibromyalgia

746
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:24,760
aches and pains they have fatigue it's

747
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,600
all neurological they have all these

748
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,840
different things going on so when you go

749
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,039
into a long water fast you get screwed

750
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,399
totally screwed you end up being that

751
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,919
one person that can't come out of it so

752
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,559
you're at a water fasting place and

753
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:38,720
you're just and you can't come out of

754
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,279
your water fast everybody else is

755
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,679
they're recovering and they're drinking

756
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:43,000
and they're eating and they're they're

757
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,960
recovering they're eating a little bit

758
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,480
of food every two hours you out of the

759
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,679
fast or eating a little bit of food but

760
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,440
you're but you're like you're dogging it

761
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,320
or a couple of people are dogging it and

762
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,799
they're not really recovering and it's

763
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,480
taking them literally two weeks to

764
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,120
recover because of neuro fatigue because

765
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,080
of neurological symptoms neurological

766
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,399
issu giving you every Edge I can

767
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,840
possibly give you with this so if you're

768
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,559
going to have a water fast I mean I

769
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,039
would do two-day water fasts the most

770
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,720
and in fact if you're ever going to

771
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,559
water Fest from here wait until you have

772
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,720
a copy of Liver Rescue in your hands go

773
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,799
get a copy of Liver Rescue and have it

774
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,159
in your hands and just make sure you

775
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,600
read all that about the liver and

776
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:21,559
cleansing liver and cleaning it up

777
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,039
because I have a cleanse in there that's

778
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:26,360
protects your liver and can really get

779
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,480
you healthy so without you having to tax

780
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,000
your body or jump into another thing

781
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,760
with the water fasting is once you go

782
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,240
two or three days and you're and you're

783
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,960
working with somebody on it or doing

784
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,480
your own you tend to put a lot of people

785
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,840
tend to go their fourth day fifth day

786
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,440
and they don't stop and it becomes an

787
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,440
addiction it becomes an addiction it

788
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
really does and it's hard to break that

789
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,799
addiction where you don't even want to

790
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,279
break it you're just in it and you just

791
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,840
want to keep going and then like a

792
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,480
Madness occurs and a Madness occurs when

793
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,960
you're water fasting too just so you

794
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,840
know when you're like in your five six

795
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,000
seven eight days you got moments of oh

796
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,600
my God I'm having Clarity it's euphoric

797
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,760
and then you're like but there's Madness

798
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,159
that occurs throughout the whole process

799
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,519
and that Madness could be like I don't

800
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,679
want to break my fast I'm on my 14th day

801
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,799
I don't want to break my water fast it's

802
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:13,720
like it it just it yeah what I'm saying

803
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,320
is you have to be careful I I would say

804
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,039
if you're doing water fast you do

805
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,720
two-day water fasts and and you can do

806
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,799
you can do them periodically you can do

807
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,279
it once a month two-day waterfest if you

808
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,120
really want to do it and that's somebody

809
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,600
without neuro fatigue that's somebody

810
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,799
without neurological fatigue that's

811
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,760
somebody without lots of viral issues

812
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:33,120
and neurotoxins and Dermot toxins and

813
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,399
everything else that I would say do a

814
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,000
two-day water fast that's somebody

815
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,399
without all of that and so let's talk

816
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,720
about dry fasting you do you want to

817
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,799
know about dry fasting it's called never

818
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,640
do it ever ever ever ever I'm going to

819
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,799
say this right now and I I can't help it

820
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,519
but anybody who actually any

821
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,679
professional any professional or any

822
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,559
expert that believes in dry fasting is

823
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,880
completely completely in the dark and

824
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,640
had doesn't really understand the body

825
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,360
and that scares the hell out of me I'm

826
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,360
just going to tell you right now I don't

827
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,159
care what war I'm starting and I don't

828
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,480
care what issues I'm starting I don't

829
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,919
care whatever I don't care whose

830
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:13,159
feelings that hurt I'm telling you that

831
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
and I I'll tell you why I'm telling you

832
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,399
that because if it's to stop somebody

833
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,360
from dry fasting so they don't hurt

834
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,640
themselves and and anybody that's around

835
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,600
them their loved ones and stuff like

836
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,320
that then then darn right I'm going to

837
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,440
say this because it matters okay I don't

838
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
care about the pitchforks and the

839
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,960
shovels and the Torches that might be at

840
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,760
my door

841
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,559
dry fasting is idiotic it's not the

842
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,440
person who's doing it's idiotic it's the

843
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,320
it's it's whatever experts who talk

844
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,399
about it are being good or whatnot it's

845
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,760
absolutely idiotic I have to say this I

846
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,519
know it sounds really you know I sound

847
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,640
obnoxious saying this like this but I'm

848
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,600
just telling you and so dry fasting no

849
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,760
off the table never never never it's a

850
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
great way to traumatize the kidneys it's

851
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,240
a great way to shut down the kidneys

852
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,039
it's a great way to put your kidneys in

853
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,679
in shock it's a great way to just

854
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:05,720
literally like fill your bloodstream up

855
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,840
with so much poison like so much poison

856
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,320
you can go into like almost sepsis it's

857
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,840
literally a an idiotic move for for

858
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,960
experts to be into dry fasting at all if

859
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,919
you're in a program and they have in

860
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,200
that program some of it is dry fasting

861
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,919
you should be out of that program I

862
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,240
don't care what you paid for it I don't

863
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:23,840
care what you paid for it or what it's

864
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,320
selling you or what it's trying to teach

865
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,519
you you should be doing I would get out

866
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,120
of it and if you're getting upset

867
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,399
because you're totally into it or you

868
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,960
support somebody who you know supports

869
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,200
somebody who believes in entirely and

870
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,279
they sell it and everything else and

871
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,480
they're selling it out there whatever

872
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:39,519
and you you you bought into it and

873
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,960
you're getting mad at me I'm sorry I'm

874
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,639
really really sorry but it's for your

875
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,679
own good it's for your own good I

876
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,320
promise that I promise that am I selling

877
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,799
anything no okay am I trying to make

878
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,639
money off the show no all right so am I

879
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:59,720
selling some kit no am I trying to help

00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:01,279
you yes yes I'm trying to help you so

881
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,519
that that's what you have to understand

882
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,480
um so with dry fasting off the table not

883
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,320
even in option it's really destructive

884
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,399
it hurts the kidneys it hurts the liver

885
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:17,159
it hurts the nervous system it literally

886
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:20,480
can cause serious brain problems kills

887
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:22,200
brain cells we're at a place on planet

888
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,720
Earth right now we can't lose brain

889
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,600
cells we can't we're losing them rapidly

890
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,720
as the human race right now

891
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,799
in in where we are and where we stand on

892
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,720
planet Earth brain cells go like never

893
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,880
before and and and yeah and that's I

894
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,240
mean it's unbelievable what's happening

895
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,679
that's why brain diseases are on the

896
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,000
rise an alltime rise it's hard to keep

897
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,000
our brain cells good what I mean by that

898
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,760
is high production purification of brain

899
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,240
cells going on what I mean by healthy

900
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,440
brain cells not not unhealthy brain

901
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,960
cells and you know it in and so what

902
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,080
happens with d fasting it it destroys

903
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,120
and takes out a lot of brain cells

904
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,120
unnecessarily and and that's not good

905
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,960
either so keep that off the table that's

906
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,000
not even in here so juice fasting we'll

907
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,440
talk about that a little bit too juice

908
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,159
fasting is is a good one too I mean it

909
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,679
is some people but remember for

910
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,440
everybody it's a little different

911
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,840
everybody it's a little different some

912
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,200
people have adrenal issues some people

913
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,120
have um um some people have weak

914
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,480
constitutions because of adrenal issues

915
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,279
maybe their nervous system isn't that

916
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,360
strong maybe they too many toxic heavy

917
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,960
metals uh maybe they have um um their

918
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,120
heart isn't that strong a lot of people

919
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,480
there's a lot of people that walk around

920
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,559
their hearts aren't that strong they're

921
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,960
they're just they have weaker hearts and

922
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,279
there's a lot of different things going

923
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,519
on in each one of us and every every

924
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,240
person some people have different levels

925
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,919
of bacteria some people have different

926
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,679
levels of viruses some people have both

927
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,399
um and so we have all this happening so

928
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,840
juice fasting uh you know is something

929
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,320
you can do with what I always say with

930
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,320
juice fasting is you don't go long term

931
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,440
even with juice fasting because when you

932
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,880
juice fast long term you if you jump

933
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,520
into a juice fast and you go into it

934
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,159
long term you could be putting a lot of

935
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,399
pressure on the liver you could be

936
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,240
putting a lot of pressure on the liver

937
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:17,720
you could be pushing the little girl off

938
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,159
the diving board and you could be

939
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,639
literally pushing that liver off the

940
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,359
diving board and you it's something to

941
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,919
really kind of think about and take in

942
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,480
consideration um juices are amazing and

943
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:32,359
incredible but juice fasting also means

944
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
that you know you're not it depends on

945
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,079
what's in your juices if you're juice

946
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,440
fasting and there's a carbohydrate in

947
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,760
your juice it's much better it's much

948
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,000
better so if you're going to jump into a

949
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,679
juice fast I'm okay with it but it it

950
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,960
has to have something in there you know

951
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,599
like apples have to be in there too it

952
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,159
has to be something that gives you some

953
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,159
calories and that's important because

954
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,800
that'll slow down your cleanse it'll

955
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,240
slow down your cleanse so your liver's

956
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,880
not going into shock so your liver is

957
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,560
not dumping a tremendous amount of

958
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,920
poison into your bloodstream so your

959
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,960
liver is not actually you know like

960
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,560
saturating your bloodstream by releasing

961
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,079
too much and if you think that's good

962
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,839
it's not good because your liver sucks

963
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,440
it all back up and only a little bit

964
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,720
leaves it's better off that the liver on

965
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,079
its own literally jumps off the diving

966
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,280
board on its own by releasing a little

967
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,079
at a time a little at a time that's it

968
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,440
that's it and this way the body can

969
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,839
process it this way the kidneys can

970
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,119
handle it this way the body can take

971
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,240
care of it cuz the liver is going to

972
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,359
protect your kidneys it's going to

973
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
protect your pancreas so when it

974
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,720
releases all when it's pushed to release

975
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,040
all that poison that I talk about in

976
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,200
Liver Rescue when it Le when it releases

977
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,640
all of that

978
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,040
junk into the

979
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,040
bloodstream it doesn't it doesn't damage

980
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,599
adrenals it doesn't damage the pancreas

981
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,599
it doesn't damage you know other aspects

982
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,880
of it doesn't damage your kidneys so

983
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:59,520
when you're juice fasting it wouldn't do

984
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,200
just green juice only I wouldn't do

985
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,440
something like just green juice only I

986
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,079
wouldn't do kale and spinach and um and

987
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,280
celery juice Believe It or Not only if

988
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,480
it's going to be longterm I wouldn't do

989
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,079
that I would have cucumbers in there I

990
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,839
would have apples in there I would have

991
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,160
pears in there I would have other things

992
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:25,440
in there I would even do oranges I would

993
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,960
have oranges in there and that kind of

994
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,119
juice fast ensures your brain is getting

995
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,000
glucose it's getting glucose it's

996
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,000
getting sugars critically needed

997
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,440
sugars so it doesn't get injured and

998
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,599
that's a whole another thing critical

999
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:42,640
needed sugars and and another thing so

1000
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,240
this way even your liver gets critically

1001
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,160
needed sugars it gets glucose and that's

1002
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,680
important too and your liver can still

1003
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,880
cleanse so if you're doing a juice fast

1004
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,119
make sure there's carbohydrates in those

1005
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,800
juices that's really important and it

1006
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:57,400
doesn't have to be in every juice if

1007
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,280
you're doing a juice fast F if you're

1008
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,760
doing a juice Fest for more than a

1009
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,680
couple of days you're going to be

1010
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,640
cleansing a lot more yes you're going to

1011
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,280
be pushing your liver a lot harder but

1012
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
like I said before you jump into any big

1013
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,760
cleanses or any big fasts you should

1014
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,200
just get a copy of Liver Rescue and

1015
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,960
consider it just consider the section of

1016
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,520
fasting and how I talk about that too

1017
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,079
before you do anything and if you don't

1018
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,920
like it what you're seeing or whatever

1019
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,640
it is and go to somewhere else and do

1020
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,119
something absolutely but I'm giving you

1021
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,720
the what not to do to keep you safe

1022
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,440
if you are out there doing different

1023
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,760
fasts and stuff like that so if you're

1024
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,640
somebody that has a pretty strong

1025
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Constitution and I mean not that Viral

1026
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,000
feeling pretty strong can handle not

1027
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,680
even eating for a little while can even

1028
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,079
handle not even

1029
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,839
eating and you know like like going

1030
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,400
without food and you know your blood

1031
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,119
sugar doesn't crash hard and you don't

1032
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,359
need a nap and you you you can get

1033
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:51,359
through your day and you can do a

1034
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,720
million things if you're one of those

1035
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,280
people you know yeah you can do a juice

1036
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,079
fast for a little while longer yeah you

1037
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,440
can I mean you're still it's possible

1038
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,599
you'll still be pushing the liver too

1039
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
hard and it'll be dumping a lot of

1040
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:04,960
poison out but if you're doing a juice

1041
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,839
fast with the carbohydrate I'm talking

1042
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,680
about by having the apples in there the

1043
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:10,800
with all the greens and having some

1044
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,640
orange in there with all the greens and

1045
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,079
by doing our pears in there with all the

1046
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,119
greens now if you're doing that and some

1047
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,680
even some watermelon in there with with

1048
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,200
everything like just you know juicing

1049
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,800
some watermelon with all of that you

1050
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,160
know you can you can definitely be much

1051
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,920
easier on the liver not so harsh on the

1052
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,880
liver it won't have to dump all this

1053
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,200
poison at once and it can protect you

1054
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,839
for the Long Haul so 3 years down the

1055
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,960
road five years down the road you're not

1056
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:40,480
hitting the wall and not realizing why

1057
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,319
it's because you did all these crazy

1058
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,040
fasts or did these dry fasts or did

1059
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:46,920
these other things three years ago four

1060
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,640
years ago and then your brain it ran out

1061
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,200
of glycogen storages that's what happens

1062
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,079
your brain starts running and running

1063
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,040
out of glycogen storage so then she just

1064
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,599
start kind of hitting the wall and you

1065
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,119
start getting confusion and you just

1066
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,319
don't know why it's because you did you

1067
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,200
did a a 10-day dry fast three years ago

1068
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:08,040
you did you know you did a water fast

1069
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,680
for 14 days you did too many of this you

1070
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,960
did too many of that and you never

1071
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,359
restored and that's a problem too you

1072
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,000
can go to you can do you can do

1073
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:18,319
different fasts out there and different

1074
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,839
programs and stuff like that but it

1075
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:21,319
doesn't mean they know how to make sure

1076
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,440
you restore what you lost because they

1077
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,240
don't even know what you lost I mean

1078
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,000
I've talked to some experts in all these

1079
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,359
fields over the years and they don't

1080
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,680
even know like the brain is actually uh

1081
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,079
made of glycogen storage they don't even

1082
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,520
know that it loses all that carbohydrate

1083
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,119
soft tissue it starts to atrophy when

1084
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,800
you're fasting dry fasting and other

1085
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,440
kinds of fasts and they don't even know

1086
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,000
this so they don't know that how you

1087
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,359
have to restore it you have to restore

1088
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,480
it with lots and lots of celery juice

1089
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,400
and that's another thing too none of the

1090
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,280
programs out there fast out there are

1091
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,079
ever using plain straight celery juice

1092
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,839
just they're never using that as a

1093
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,040
recovery tool or even a fasting tool in

1094
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:01,000
the juice fasting and that's a mistake

1095
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,119
all on its own so they have all these

1096
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,880
different juices but they don't even

1097
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:05,319
have straight celery juice so you can

1098
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
protect your brain so you can protect

1099
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:10,040
your liver so you can protect what's

1100
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,000
right rightfully yours you see why I'm

1101
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,480
frustrated and you see why I had to do

1102
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,079
the show and so it it these are all the

1103
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,680
things to to to consider all the things

1104
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,960
to consider I'm not trying to make it

1105
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,960
complicated if you're if you're a strong

1106
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,000
person and you've already if you've

1107
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,640
already been eating good good for a

1108
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,319
while eating clean for a while maybe

1109
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,839
even the 28 day cleanse for a while

1110
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,400
maybe just eating

1111
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,760
clean for a while not a lot of junk not

1112
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,440
so much fats not so much fats and not a

1113
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,000
lot of junk and you're eating clean for

1114
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,240
a while more fruits and vegetables more

1115
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,240
fruits and vegetables and you're doing

1116
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,599
your lemon water because your lemon

1117
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,280
water is cleansing your liver every

1118
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,319
single day a little bit and you're doing

1119
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,440
all of that and you're doing some celery

1120
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:58,720
juice every single day so then you want

1121
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,760
to jump into a little bit of a water

1122
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,119
fast okay you know what I'm on board you

1123
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,319
want to jump if that's what you really

1124
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,319
want if you want to jump into a juice

1125
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:14,800
fast done right yeah okay I'm on board

1126
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:16,920
I'm on board so but what I recommend is

1127
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,800
you do the celery juice but you really

1128
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,119
do it there's people out there I see it

1129
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
all the time they don't even do their

1130
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,480
celer jues but then they get pushed into

1131
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,960
some fasting program and in that fasting

1132
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,000
program they also sell like a zillion

1133
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,359
herbs with alcohol in them I'm gonna

1134
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,359
have to cover that for a second okay if

1135
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,640
you're running into like some kind of

1136
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,599
some guy or some gal's

1137
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,920
program that that has supplements in it

1138
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,960
and they're recommending all the stuff

1139
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,880
and there's alcohol in those supplements

1140
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,839
then you're in the wrong place you're in

1141
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,280
the wrong

1142
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:55,160
place absolutely 100% the alcohol it it

1143
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,200
kills all of your internal bacteria in

1144
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,079
your intestinal tract in your gut

1145
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,280
destroys all of your good bacteria and

1146
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,200
microorganisms so if you're doctor

1147
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,640
practitioner you're expert your Guru

1148
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,720
doesn't know that and they're selling

1149
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,240
you kits with alcohol in

1150
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,079
them that's right there should tell you

1151
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,079
back out because what happens is that

1152
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,720
that that's what one of the most oh my

1153
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,160
God I can't even tell you how important

1154
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,880
that is all that alcohol all that

1155
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,240
alcohol gets inside the liver all that

1156
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,800
tincture alcohol gets inside the liver

1157
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,400
all that tinure alcohol wipes out all

1158
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,000
the microorganisms in the gut all that

1159
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,000
tincture alcohol blows out your

1160
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,599
hydrochloric acid

1161
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,079
reserves and that's just that's just to

1162
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,000
start with that's just to start with I

1163
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,480
don't care if it's grape alcohol I don't

1164
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
care what kind of alcohol it is so you

1165
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,000
have to know that and I noticed that

1166
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,839
there's fasting fasting you know kits

1167
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,760
and fasting things out there and gurus

1168
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,119
and stuff promoting that and then they

1169
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,400
have that in there and you spend all

1170
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,040
this money and you're you're dumping

1171
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,319
straight alcohol tinctures and straight

1172
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,839
alcohol in your system I've never seen

1173
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:03,000
anything just so ridiculous so just look

1174
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:04,720
out for that look out for that okay um

1175
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,960
so if you're somebody that if you're

1176
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,119
somebody look I would I would do the

1177
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,119
celery juice I would really do it I

1178
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:12,920
would really do it and I would really

1179
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,880
eat

1180
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,839
clean and then you can do a juice fast

1181
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,960
but first before you do anything I would

1182
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,720
look at the Liver Rescue and just look

1183
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,480
at

1184
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,359
that and feel it out and see how you

1185
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,520
feel about it

1186
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,160
and because honestly it's and it's it's

1187
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,240
really easy to do too it's really easy

1188
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,040
to do when you get it you'll see it but

1189
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,440
the bottom line is is um I do I do yes I

1190
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,520
do support water fasting small

1191
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,200
increments for the right people that

1192
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,720
have already gotten themselves clean

1193
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,760
enough so they don't shock their liver

1194
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,720
shock their bodies fill it up with

1195
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:53,680
poison and then go backwards later on

1196
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,760
including hurting their adrenals later

1197
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,160
on so I do support water fast testing if

1198
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,520
you've you know when if you've gotten to

1199
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,359
a point where you've done the celery

1200
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,240
juice for a year you've done the celery

1201
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,800
juice for 6 months you've been working

1202
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,119
on healing you've been doing all your

1203
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,000
you've been really cleaning yourself up

1204
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,839
fast tracking out of the fact that

1205
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,280
people feel like they just don't have it

1206
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,839
in them to do any of the work and they

1207
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,800
want to FastTrack something that's scary

1208
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:20,480
so they just jump into some fasting kits

1209
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,559
some fasting program whatever it is just

1210
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,079
be careful

1211
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,240
um

1212
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,839
and juice fasting the same thing but

1213
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,200
juice fasting you want to do a long-term

1214
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:32,559
juice faster you know like you want to

1215
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,839
be a long long-term juice faster there

1216
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,920
better be a carbohydrate in that juice

1217
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:42,000
it can't just be only

1218
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:45,200
only um non-starchy vegetables and green

1219
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,800
leafy greens has to be there has to be

1220
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,359
always celery involved but you have to

1221
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,480
also have the carbohydrate ones you have

1222
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:52,000
to have the apples you have to have the

1223
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,400
Cucumbers you have to have these options

1224
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,319
you have to have peirs you have to have

1225
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,559
oranges and even you can be creative you

1226
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,720
can you other other things too you could

1227
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,720
have watermelon whatever it is that has

1228
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,440
to be in there that's really important

1229
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,440
if you're doing juice fast along with

1230
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,880
the greens along with lots of celery

1231
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,040
juice by itself by itself and then other

1232
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,280
juices with the carbs in there with the

1233
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,680
the healthy the healthy carbs in there

1234
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,599
so your brain does an atrophy so you can

1235
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,880
actually get the electrolytes strong so

1236
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:19,440
you can actually do what you need to do

1237
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,520
while you're fasting and removing

1238
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,760
poisons and removing toxins let's talk

1239
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,240
about intermittent fasting now first of

1240
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:30,720
all most most of you probably know about

1241
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,760
the the adrenal snacks I always promote

1242
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,640
you should be eating every couple of

1243
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,240
hours okay you know that and um and that

1244
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,240
that's a critical thing to understand

1245
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,040
that you that what happens is that

1246
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,119
people that people have these weak

1247
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,160
nervous systems most of the people that

1248
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,160
have ever come to me and have ever you

1249
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,400
know gotten the medical medium books

1250
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,920
they're dealing with a lot of

1251
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,960
neurological problems anxiety depression

1252
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,359
migraines of all different kinds neck

1268
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,280
group of people that we have that's out

1269
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,839
there in the world and that needs help

1270
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,960
it's if they go too long without eating

1271
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,760
their adrenals and their nervous system

1272
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:48,160
and their neuro fatigue can get worse so

1273
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,240
the every the every couple of hours and

1274
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,000
eating is to protect this to protect

1275
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,359
everyone so it's like you and you don't

1276
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,400
have to eat a large meal every couple

1277
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,640
hours it's just once you go go 2 three

1278
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,119
hours without food once you go 2 three

1279
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,839
hours without food your blood sugar

1280
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,440
drops and you're running on adrenaline

1281
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,880
now so now your adrenals are running and

1282
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,760
you're running on adrenaline adrenaline

1283
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,839
makes more neuro fatigue and it makes

1284
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,680
more adrenal fatigue and it makes more

1285
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,040
liver problems and it makes more blood

1286
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,480
sugar problems so always always

1287
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,200
advocated you know to to make sure you

1288
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,960
you have snacks throughout the day and

1289
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,559
you're not pulling that whole thing that

1290
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,119
we're taught when we're younger when we

1291
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,040
go to college or anything else even

1292
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:27,440
though I never went to college and we go

1293
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,240
to college and we're doing whatever

1294
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,160
we're doing it's you know you're just

1295
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,480
like you're running on empty all day

1296
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,839
long with ad with adrenaline running and

1297
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,680
you know it's like that kind of thing

1298
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:38,680
and we kind of carry that out to the

1299
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,119
workforce and when we get older and

1300
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,599
everything and then when you're sick and

1301
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,839
you can't get out of bed and you got the

1302
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,319
neuro fatigue and you're sick and

1303
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,240
everything the the you you also can't go

1304
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:51,240
too long without getting some fuel in

1305
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,400
you so that's why you that's another

1306
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,240
thing too it's important to have the

1307
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,359
every two hours but intermittent fasting

1308
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,480
I do also support

1309
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:00,440
so there's some people where it is

1310
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,480
helpful where they they don't eat

1311
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,119
anything in the morning a part of that a

1312
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,839
part of that um you know H happens

1313
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,280
because if they do eat in the morning

1314
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,720
they feel kind of thrown by everything

1315
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,240
they feel thrown they don't feel right

1316
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,520
or they just feel like their digestion

1317
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,520
can't handle it yet so I totally totally

1318
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,559
totally support intermittent fasting too

1319
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,800
and there are people out there that I've

1320
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:26,000
had to say hey look why don't you just

1321
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,839
do why don't you why don't you do your

1322
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,079
lemon water in the morning and just go

1323
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,960
that go until

1324
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,440
11:00 and then at 11:00 you know have

1325
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,720
your first

1326
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,160
snack and you know and there's there you

1327
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,920
know or you know you can go longer but

1328
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,440
it's only it's not a forever thing for

1329
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,040
people so always remember that if it it

1330
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,960
could work for you in that moment in

1331
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,480
your life it can work for you for that 6

1332
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,599
months it could work for you for that

1333
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,480
year but always but

1334
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,240
never never fall into to the to the

1335
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,040
feeling that that's the way it always

1336
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,880
has to be and you always have to do

1337
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,119
intermittent fasting where you you don't

1338
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,599
eat for half a day or you don't eat for

1339
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,040
3/4 of a day don't feel that that's a

1340
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,559
forever thing that might be a moment in

1341
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,200
your life might be a moment in your life

1342
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,839
where you're doing that and then you're

1343
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,280
eating later in the afternoon and you're

1344
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,480
eating at the end of the day and and

1345
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,599
that feels good for you and that feels

1346
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,280
like it eases off your digestion so what

1347
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:28,480
happens is a lot of people a lot of

1348
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,599
people have inflamed intestinal tracts

1349
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,400
inflamed dadums they even have hypers

1350
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,119
sensitive nerves and their stomach

1351
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,440
Linings and in their small intestinal

1352
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,960
tract and their large intes they have

1353
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,000
highly sensitive nerves so when they put

1354
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:44,520
food in every anytime they eat they put

1355
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,280
food in it it it rubs on everything so

1356
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,880
it goes through the stomach through the

1357
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,720
dadum down into the small intestinal

1358
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,960
tract and it rubs on all the nerves and

1359
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,599
they feel like they can't digest they

1360
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,559
feel like they're in pain and they feel

1361
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,000
like they're hurting so they don't want

1362
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,160
to eat and they feel better if they

1363
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,119
don't eat for like half a day or eat for

1364
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,040
a little

1365
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:05,520
while and and then they you know until

1366
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,559
they finally have to eat so I mean I

1367
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:11,079
total look I'm supportive of it totally

1368
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,079
supportive of it if you can't eat the

1369
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:14,640
every 2 hours to keep your blood sugar

1370
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,079
stable to protect your liver protect

1371
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,680
your adrenals so they don't run and

1372
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,119
flood the body if you can't eat every

1373
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:23,839
two hours try every 3 hours you know if

1374
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,599
you can't eat every 3 hours yeah try

1375
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:29,680
every 4 hours if you have to something

1376
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:32,079
like that but you but the but the point

1377
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,040
is the point is is that you can

1378
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:39,119
intermittent F you can do that that's

1379
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:41,280
okay if that feels good I I have

1380
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,200
recommended that for a lot of people

1381
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,760
over the years I have and but it's not

1382
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,880
longterm too you try it out you see

1383
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,400
there's going to be times in your life

1384
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,920
where you feel like you can do it and

1385
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,559
you feel like it makes you feel good and

1386
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,400
it eases things up and and it gives you

1387
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,640
more clarity during the day and stuff

1388
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,280
like that then that there's some people

1389
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,920
that feel that way and then there's

1390
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,799
times where it may you may not be in a

1391
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,319
place in your life where all of a sudden

1392
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:06,640
now you're under some different stress

1393
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:08,839
and you got to do this or you got to

1394
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,799
work or something has to happen and you

1395
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:13,760
can't run like that and you need to do

1396
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:15,400
the adrenal snacks you need to do the

1397
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,559
adrenal snacks you need to do the blood

1398
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,520
sugar support snacks you need to make

1399
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:20,960
sure you're getting some fuel to your

1400
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,640
brain you're making sure you're getting

1401
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,880
some sugars to your brain so you can

1402
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:30,200
function and so it could it could very

1403
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,799
at different times in your life um so

1404
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:35,359
what do I like I like juice fasting I

1405
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:38,839
like water fasting I like intermittent

1406
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:43,160
fasting I do I do I do I do I don't like

1407
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:45,200
dry fasting but in the in the way I'm

1408
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,319
saying I like the try I in the way I'm

1409
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,760
saying I like the water fasting and I

1410
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:51,680

1411
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,119
fasting okay in the way I'm saying and

1412
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,960
um I know a lot of people they can't go

1413
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,240
without they can't go without a snack

1414
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,559
for out a couple of hours and if they do

1415
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,000
they start falling apart I've had people

1416
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,440
contact me recently where they were so

1417
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,720
busy and they were running around all

1418
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,240
day long and they're dropping their kids

1419
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,480
off at soccer and they're doing this and

1420
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,200
they just all like they started just

1421
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,440
getting shaky and shaking every day and

1422
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,400
feeling weaker and and when you really

1423
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,520
looked at it they ran about seven hours

1424
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,400
during the day six seven hours during

1425
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,599
the day without one thing without eating

1426
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,640
one thing one thing and their blood was

1427
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,599
literally

1428
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,960
crashing and like crashing and and and

1429
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,960
they were out of glucose and their

1430
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,520
nervous system was getting weaker and so

1431
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,319
you know intermittent fasting doesn't

1432
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:42,119
work for everybody but there is a small

1433
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:45,119
crowd that can try it and it can help

1434
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:48,319
them until things change and they get a

1435
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:50,040
little stronger or or things change and

1436
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,839
they feel like they can eat more and

1437
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,200
their inflammation drops down in their

1438
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,040
intestinal tract from all the other

1439
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,920
things they're doing and eating clean

1440
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,040
and not eating um the wrong Foods so

1441
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,839
yeah so intermittent fasting I support

1442
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,760
too so these are these are the three

1443
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:07,440
different options three different

1444
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,799
options if you're you know getting told

1445
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,440
if you're getting something tells you to

1446
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:15,280
jump into a long water fast I would just

1447
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,319
wait and at least get Liver Rescue in

1448
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,440
your hands so you can understand more

1449
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,480
about fasting more about how the liver

1450
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,119
works so you're not paying a price down

1451
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,359
the road with the liver it it's

1452
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,559
important because we got to care care

1453
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,480
for our liver and care for and get it

1454
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:32,559
cleaned up safely so that if you do a

1455
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,400
juice fast longer you know how to

1456
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,680
protect yourself if you do a water fast

1457
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,480
longer because that's what you want to

1458
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,480
do spiritually or something then you

1459
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,240
know how to protect you could protect

1460
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,520
yourself more and that's the key so

1461
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,559
right now I'm basically what I'm saying

1462
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,400
is gradually go from like doing the

1463
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:48,880
celery juice every day making sure

1464
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,680
you're doing like the celery juice every

1465
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,359
single day making sure you're eating

1466
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,240
clean doing the no Foods making sure

1467
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:57,079
you're not doing eggs dairy and you're

1468
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,480
not doing too many animal products or if

1469
00:53:57,079 --> 00:54:01,440
you're vegetarian vegan you're not doing

1470
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,200
too many nuts and then you're doing

1471
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,000
you're do and too many oils you got to

1472
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,040
be careful and making sure you're you're

1473
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
graduating to a point where you're

1474
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,760
cleaning up your liver over time whether

1475
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,280
it's a 28 day cleanser you're eating

1476
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,119
better and you're cleaning up the liver

1477
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,520
you're getting yourself prepared you're

1478
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:21,160
getting yourself nutritionally fortified

1479
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,400
so that if you do two-day water fast on

1480
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,680
the weekend or 3-day water fast on the

1481
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,599
weekend you know even super advised by a

1482
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,559
practitioner and so forth so you do a

1483
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,160
juice fast with with the right juices

1484
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,799
that I talked about earlier so you can

1485
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,040
do these things and not hurt your liver

1486
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:38,760
and move forward and heal and not

1487
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,319
saturate your body with too many poisons

1488
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:44,799
that would be amazing that would be

1489
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,400
amazing okay and for intermittent uh

1490
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:49,400
intermittent fasting you know play it by

1491
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,160
ears you can try it out see how you feel

1492
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,359
anyone can try that out but at least you

1493
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,400
know you can fall back on other options

1494
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,440
