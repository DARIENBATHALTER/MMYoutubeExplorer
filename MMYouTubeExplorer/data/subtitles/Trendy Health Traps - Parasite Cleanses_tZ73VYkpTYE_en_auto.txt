[99.68 - 105.04] of a ride lots of different parasitical
[102.32 - 106.40] cleanses and alternative movement
[105.04 - 108.24] okay

[108.24 - 112.88] it already did its thing it burnt itself
[110.72 - 115.20] out it bros up a little bit and then
[112.88 - 116.96] burnt itself out and died
[115.20 - 117.68] an ugly death
[116.96 - 118.96] right
[117.68 - 121.76] but now
[118.96 - 124.80] it is coming back same thing with
[121.76 - 126.72] alkaline ionizer water machines okay
[124.80 - 128.24] because not going to ionize the water
[126.72 - 129.84] machines they've been around they've
[128.24 - 132.56] been around all those years no one got
[129.84 - 133.84] better you go and buy expensive water
[132.56 - 136.24] machine
[133.84 - 137.76] and you're drinking your alkaline water
[136.24 - 139.52] you still got your aches and pains
[137.76 - 142.56] tingles and numbness ticks and spasms
[139.52 - 144.16] brain fog neck and back pain you still
[142.56 - 145.92] got your fatigue
[144.16 - 148.40] and all those machines went into
[145.92 - 150.24] everybody's closet
[148.40 - 151.36] again it went into everybody's closet
[150.24 - 153.68] right
[151.36 - 156.48] you know which ones stand out and you
[153.68 - 157.76] know which ones don't stand out because
[156.48 - 160.24] back then
[157.76 - 162.96] that died in ugly death too so the
[160.24 - 163.92] ionizer water machine world just went
[162.96 - 166.32] tanked
[163.92 - 168.32] right and then social media picked up
[166.32 - 170.40] and social media picked up
[168.32 - 172.16] okay same thing coffee enemas people did
[170.40 - 174.56] the coffee enemas coffee enemas all
[172.16 - 176.24] those years ago coffee enemas
[174.56 - 178.16] they did them they did them didn't fix
[176.24 - 179.60] them made them sicker
[178.16 - 180.40] didn't fix them
[179.60 - 182.72] right
[180.40 - 185.84] and then that kind of died
[182.72 - 189.44] an ugly death that kind of died
[185.84 - 190.40] but then social media came on and then
[189.44 - 192.56] boom
[190.40 - 194.88] everything started picking up
[192.56 - 196.80] right coffee enema supplies started
[194.88 - 199.44] picking up let's get it out there
[196.80 - 202.72] alkaline ionizer water machines parasite
[199.44 - 206.00] cleanses right i'm just naming a few
[202.72 - 209.52] few trendy traps just a few
[206.00 - 211.52] there's dozens okay dozens
[209.52 - 213.60] but social media picked up
[211.52 - 214.96] and then the marketing happened to
[213.60 - 216.88] marketing
[214.96 - 217.84] all the heavy marketing
[216.88 - 220.32] right
[217.84 - 222.64] and then the incentives with all the
[220.32 - 224.56] marketing with the trendy traps
[222.64 - 226.40] but none of those things and so many
[224.56 - 229.20] more like the rife machine
[226.40 - 231.84] that was a disaster disaster the rife
[229.20 - 233.60] machine back 20 years ago
[231.84 - 235.20] people buy the rife machine and sitting
[233.60 - 236.88] there you know with the right machine in
[235.20 - 239.20] their hand
[236.88 - 241.20] and then boom still their neurological
[239.20 - 245.28] symptoms burning skin aches and pains
[241.20 - 248.08] ringing in the ears tinnitus vertigo uh
[245.28 - 249.44] severe brain fog floaters in the eyes
[248.08 - 251.60] neck pain back pain all these other
[249.44 - 253.60] issues still stayed there but you still
[251.60 - 256.24] had your rife machine
[253.60 - 258.16] right but then like i said everything
[256.24 - 260.80] changes all this money gets dumped into
[258.16 - 263.44] all these things to revive them they die
[260.80 - 265.52] this ugly death
[263.44 - 268.32] all of these things all did throughout
[265.52 - 271.60] the years and then they get revived
[268.32 - 273.28] they get revitalized by money
[271.60 - 275.52] because now we've got a whole new world
[273.28 - 277.20] got the social media world and just dump
[275.52 - 279.12] a whole bunch get the investors get the
[277.20 - 281.52] shareholders on board and dump a whole
[279.12 - 283.44] bunch of money into things
[281.52 - 285.36] and get them back up oh buy a rice
[283.44 - 287.44] machine oh buy an alkaline isonizer
[285.36 - 290.24] let's do that okay i'll get another mat
[287.44 - 292.24] to lay on okay i'll get uh maybe i'll
[290.24 - 293.60] pick up a hyperbaric oxygen chamber you
[292.24 - 294.88] know people laid in those things and
[293.60 - 296.40] laid those things and laid in those
[294.88 - 297.92] hyperbaric oxygen chambers they never
[296.40 - 299.60] got better
[297.92 - 301.68] when they were sick really sick when
[299.60 - 303.28] they had the neurological lyme and they
[301.68 - 305.52] had all the other conditions right
[303.28 - 307.52] people have that now okay
[305.52 - 308.72] man they've been around those oxygen
[307.52 - 311.52] chambers
[308.72 - 313.28] but everybody was stuck
[311.52 - 316.00] everybody was stuck
[313.28 - 317.52] right and then by default people started
[316.00 - 318.96] learning through medical medium tools
[317.52 - 320.72] and stuff about getting rid of that
[318.96 - 322.64] gluten going all the way back when i

[411.60 - 414.48] spacecraft
[413.52 - 416.32] and
[414.48 - 418.24] until those tools started to kick it in
[416.32 - 420.64] people people got off those processed
[418.24 - 422.32] foods and they back down on the butter
[420.64 - 423.68] it's another one too back down on the

[427.92 - 431.76] they do they start picking up speed and
[429.92 - 433.92] all of a sudden for some reason wait a
[431.76 - 435.60] minute you know
[433.92 - 437.12] what's working what's not working like
[435.60 - 439.28] what's starting to fix me a little bit
[437.12 - 441.52] what's not starting to fix with fix me
[439.28 - 442.96] back in the older days you just had the
[441.52 - 444.64] gimmicky stuff
[442.96 - 447.12] you had the rife
[444.64 - 449.04] machine you had the alkaliners alkaline
[447.12 - 451.44] ionizer machines
[449.04 - 454.72] you had the oxygen hyperbaric chambers
[451.44 - 456.72] right hyperbaric oxygen chambers you had
[454.72 - 459.44] all these other different things right
[456.72 - 462.32] you had these right and
[459.44 - 464.96] at the same time
[462.32 - 467.20] you had all these you know people
[464.96 - 469.12] weren't they weren't moving forward they
[467.20 - 471.84] weren't moving forward so these things
[469.12 - 473.52] would be all stuck in people's closets
[471.84 - 475.68] that's where they would be it's like a
[473.52 - 477.60] whole closet full of all this stuff
[475.68 - 479.52] you'd have the mat in there you'd have
[477.60 - 481.52] the you know the foot bath in there
[479.52 - 482.32] you'd have all these different things
[481.52 - 483.28] right
[482.32 - 485.12] but
[483.28 - 487.12] one of the things is the parasitical
[485.12 - 488.88] cleanses was big right the parasitical
[487.12 - 490.72] cleanses
[488.88 - 491.60] that was a big one
[490.72 - 493.76] right
[491.60 - 495.60] it's like everybody's got a parasite
[493.76 - 497.92] everybody's got a parasite you go to a
[495.60 - 499.92] doctor of like not a conventional doctor
[497.92 - 501.20] but you go to an alternative person it's
[499.92 - 502.80] like you got a parasite that's what's
[501.20 - 504.96] wrong with you
[502.80 - 506.64] really what do i need to do oh do this
[504.96 - 508.24] you can put a whole bunch of olive oil
[506.64 - 509.84] in here and put a bunch of stuff in
[508.24 - 511.92] there and put this cleansing stuff in
[509.84 - 514.08] here you can put these powders in here a
[511.92 - 516.48] whole bunch of probiotics
[514.08 - 517.92] and still stay sick here's some clay
[516.48 - 520.00] here's some bentonite clay that's
[517.92 - 522.16] another trendy trap right bentonite clay
[520.00 - 524.16] maybe do a coffee enema under boot with
[522.16 - 527.36] your bentonite clay
[524.16 - 529.76] it was endless it was always like this
[527.36 - 530.72] it was always like this
[529.76 - 533.68] this is
[530.72 - 535.52] what life was like back then but now
[533.68 - 536.40] it's still life now
[535.52 - 538.80] right
[536.40 - 540.64] these things revive these old things
[538.80 - 543.92] revive themselves
[540.64 - 544.96] people get on board with a ton of money
[543.92 - 547.52] and
[544.96 - 550.08] the one thing all these things hate all
[547.52 - 551.36] the shareholders to all these different
[550.08 - 553.44] endeavors
[551.36 - 555.92] what they hate
[553.44 - 557.44] they hate with a passion
[555.92 - 559.44] is that right there
[557.44 - 560.72] they hate it
[559.44 - 562.88] when this
[560.72 - 566.00] got more known and more known and more
[562.88 - 569.76] known and more known
[566.00 - 571.60] it pissed everybody off
[569.76 - 572.72] is what it did
[571.60 - 575.44] okay
[572.72 - 577.44] you can go into a juice store right you
[575.44 - 579.84] can go into a juice bar
[577.44 - 582.32] and get yourself a fresh celery juice
[579.84 - 584.08] and turn your life around
[582.32 - 586.24] and start turning your life remove the
[584.08 - 587.92] needle when nothing else could
[586.24 - 589.68] when nothing else could
[587.92 - 591.36] when all these people
[589.68 - 592.88] seasoned people who've been through hell
[591.36 - 594.40] and back who tried everything they tried
[592.88 - 596.16] all the clays they tried all this they
[594.40 - 598.88] tried diatomaceous earth particles they
[596.16 - 600.08] tried the apple cider vinegar
[598.88 - 601.92] they tried all these different
[600.08 - 605.68] techniques and things they tried ozone
[601.92 - 607.60] therapy right tried ozone therapy
[605.68 - 608.96] and all of a sudden
[607.60 - 611.28] they said you know they heard from
[608.96 - 613.04] somebody else or heard medical medium or
[611.28 - 614.56] heard something from his book or heard
[613.04 - 616.32] from another person
[614.56 - 618.88] or maybe who recommended it because of
[616.32 - 622.00] medical meaning they heard about the
[618.88 - 624.16] celery juice and they start drinking it
[622.00 - 627.36] and something changes
[624.16 - 628.24] really changes the needle starts to move
[627.36 - 631.36] right
[628.24 - 633.04] starts to move but here's what's funny
[631.36 - 635.44] there isn't hundreds and hundreds of
[633.04 - 637.84] millions of dollars invested into
[635.44 - 640.00] brainwashing you to drink celery juice
[637.84 - 641.52] in fact it's the opposite
[640.00 - 643.68] did you guys know
[641.52 - 645.52] there's money invested to stop you from
[643.68 - 647.84] drinking celery juice
[645.52 - 649.12] every single day out there
[647.84 - 651.44] that's right
[649.12 - 652.64] there wasn't a single article positive
[651.44 - 654.56] about it
[652.64 - 657.12] they just tried to stomp on it with
[654.56 - 658.64] everything they had the media
[657.12 - 661.04] the industries
[658.64 - 662.80] how many dietitians oh celery juice
[661.04 - 665.28] isn't good for you you should just eat
[662.80 - 667.60] the stock because i'm a dietitian and i
[665.28 - 669.84] know and i'm gonna oh i'm invited to go
[667.60 - 672.16] on an article to rip down celery juice
[669.84 - 674.40] and make sure i tell people there's no
[672.16 - 676.16] science behind celery juice
[674.40 - 677.52] i'm a dietitian and there's no science
[676.16 - 678.88] behind celery juice and they're going to
[677.52 - 680.32] make sure they stick that in every
[678.88 - 683.44] article
[680.32 - 684.80] there's money invested
[683.44 - 686.48] shareholders
[684.80 - 689.36] money out there
[686.48 - 691.68] to take down celery juice
[689.36 - 693.20] like a real spiritual battle
[691.68 - 694.96] good and evil
[693.20 - 700.24] did you know that
[694.96 - 702.40] a real spiritual battle of good and evil
[700.24 - 704.40] to take down celery juice
[702.40 - 705.28] to stop it
[704.40 - 707.84] and
[705.28 - 709.84] make it seem like trife
[707.84 - 712.16] make it seem
[709.84 - 714.64] not really
[712.16 - 716.40] could do anything it's just a vegetable
[714.64 - 717.68] yeah you can chop it up and throw it in
[716.40 - 718.88] something
[717.68 - 723.12] you can
[718.88 - 724.40] have a celery stick and a carrot
[723.12 - 726.32] and
[724.40 - 727.68] really it's not going to help in any way
[726.32 - 728.88] okay
[727.68 - 730.88] and that's
[728.88 - 733.04] what has happened where
[730.88 - 734.80] there's been money
[733.04 - 737.20] millions of dollars
[734.80 - 740.08] invested
[737.20 - 741.28] to shut this down
[740.08 - 742.48] millions
[741.28 - 744.72] while
[742.48 - 746.08] millions of dollars are invested to
[744.72 - 747.68] bring back
[746.08 - 750.00] the old garbage
[747.68 - 752.80] like the fulvic minerals that never got
[750.00 - 756.24] anybody better in the last 20 years
[752.80 - 757.04] except if you're drinking celery juice
[756.24 - 758.80] like
[757.04 - 760.40] in the closet
[758.80 - 762.24] get my celery juice down and then i'll
[760.40 - 764.80] go and talk about fulvic minerals
[762.24 - 767.28] because it's an mlm campaign i'll go
[764.80 - 769.52] i'll drink my celery juice
[767.28 - 771.36] you know and do my yoga drink my celery
[769.52 - 773.52] juice and then i'll go i'll go talk
[771.36 - 775.36] about alkaline ionizer water machines
[773.52 - 778.16] because yeah because i'm part of the
[775.36 - 778.16] pyramid scheme
[778.40 - 783.60] and it was that that got me better not
[780.88 - 784.64] the celery juice
[783.60 - 786.64] and
[784.64 - 788.64] but the celery juice
[786.64 - 790.24] has turned so many lives around at this
[788.64 - 792.64] point
[790.24 - 795.12] it's really unbelievable
[792.64 - 796.56] but it's also an eyesore it's been an
[795.12 - 798.48] eyesore
[796.56 - 801.28] one thing is the celery
[798.48 - 802.48] powders like celery juice powders that
[801.28 - 804.16] came to town because they were trying to
[802.48 - 806.16] hop on the bandwagon well that got
[804.16 - 809.20] crushed pretty much
[806.16 - 810.80] because we know through the books and
[809.20 - 812.72] all the information talking about it
[810.80 - 815.20] that the powders don't work
[812.72 - 817.04] so they really can't they can't really
[815.20 - 818.80] get as far as they need to go it's a
[817.04 - 821.12] fresh celery juice
[818.80 - 824.16] we know that you freshly juice with your
[821.12 - 826.80] juicer or you go into a juice bar and
[824.16 - 829.20] you buy it right freshly juiced that
[826.80 - 831.76] turn that turns things makes things
[829.20 - 834.48] happen that makes things happen
[831.76 - 835.68] that gets you better
[834.48 - 837.60] so
[835.68 - 838.80] the one thing about the trendy traps out
[837.60 - 840.88] there is they're still out there and
[838.80 - 843.20] there's still many of them out there
[840.88 - 844.00] lots of trendy traps
[843.20 - 845.60] and
[844.00 - 848.00] the parasite one i was talking about
[845.60 - 851.36] because that one's making a comeback
[848.00 - 854.32] because of the parasite cleanses
[851.36 - 856.72] because of the parasite probiotic stuff
[854.32 - 861.20] because the microbiome talk
[856.72 - 864.16] but fecal matter implants
[861.20 - 864.16] coffee enemas
[864.48 - 870.40] various probiotics with all this stuff
[866.56 - 873.76] in it including clays and bentonite clay
[870.40 - 875.52] really are not the answer
[873.76 - 876.80] they're not
[875.52 - 880.16] i'll give you a little run down on
[876.80 - 882.84] parasites just for a quick second here
[880.16 - 886.24] if you catch a
[882.84 - 888.24] parasite you die
[886.24 - 891.20] or the parasite dies
[888.24 - 893.36] there's no in between
[891.20 - 896.88] there's no in between
[893.36 - 899.44] you drink some bad water
[896.88 - 900.72] right out of a puddle
[899.44 - 902.48] you drink
[900.72 - 904.48] some water
[902.48 - 907.12] out of a pond
[904.48 - 909.28] and you get a parasite
[907.12 - 911.76] you [ __ ] your brains out
[909.28 - 913.92] and throw up your brains out
[911.76 - 915.92] until one of you makes it whether you
[913.92 - 919.12] sit in the hospital
[915.92 - 921.52] on iv and painkillers until you win the
[919.12 - 921.52] battle
[921.68 - 926.96] okay or you lose the battle
[924.24 - 929.76] there's no in between with parasites
[926.96 - 932.08] you don't walk around with parasites in
[929.76 - 936.40] you you don't
[932.08 - 936.40] okay you can walk around with worms
[936.56 - 942.64] but that's not a
[938.84 - 944.08] parasite worms are worms
[942.64 - 945.92] and guess what
[944.08 - 948.08] people walk around with worms and
[945.92 - 949.60] they're never sick you can walk around
[948.08 - 951.36] with worms and eat chocolate cake and
[949.60 - 952.72] pizza and there's people they're not
[951.36 - 954.48] sick they don't have chronic illness and
[952.72 - 955.92] they're playing tennis they're doing
[954.48 - 958.72] whatever they're playing tennis they're
[955.92 - 960.72] drinking martinis they're drinking wine
[958.72 - 963.28] they're partying they're staying up all
[960.72 - 966.24] night they do that to 30s and their 40s
[963.28 - 967.68] they never got sick yet
[966.24 - 968.40] it never tipped to scale with other
[967.68 - 970.24] things
[968.40 - 971.12] they have worms in them
[970.24 - 975.68] yeah
[971.12 - 975.68] you can live with worms in you you can't
[975.84 - 978.96] and
[976.80 - 980.16] those worms won't make you sick
[978.96 - 983.04] unless
[980.16 - 986.64] it's a five foot tapeworm
[983.04 - 988.48] but you'll know and you'll know quick
[986.64 - 992.00] now parasites
[988.48 - 994.72] you drink some nasty water
[992.00 - 996.40] you're down in mexico and you drink that
[994.72 - 998.08] water
[996.40 - 999.36] what do you think that is when you get
[998.08 - 1001.20] sick what do you think they tell you not
[999.36 - 1002.88] to drink the water in mexico
[1001.20 - 1004.64] because when you get that parasite it's
[1002.88 - 1007.04] you or the parasite
[1004.64 - 1009.12] you win or the parasite wins you don't
[1007.04 - 1010.88] keep that parasite that you picked up in
[1009.12 - 1013.28] mexico
[1010.88 - 1015.52] from that water
[1013.28 - 1017.68] you don't keep it i've known so many
[1015.52 - 1018.88] people they've gone to india
[1017.68 - 1021.12] right
[1018.88 - 1022.96] they've gotten a parasite
[1021.12 - 1024.80] eating in some restaurant i know some
[1022.96 - 1026.32] people here in the united states lots of
[1024.80 - 1028.88] them they go into a restaurant they pick
[1026.32 - 1031.28] up a parasite
[1028.88 - 1033.12] right you're in europe you're traveling
[1031.28 - 1034.48] and you eat something somewhere some
[1033.12 - 1037.04] street food
[1034.48 - 1039.84] you pick up a parasite
[1037.04 - 1042.64] it's you're the parasite
[1039.84 - 1044.40] you stay sick gravely sick until the
[1042.64 - 1047.20] parasite's gone
[1044.40 - 1048.64] you sit in the hospital
[1047.20 - 1049.92] or at home
[1048.64 - 1051.28] you barf
[1049.92 - 1054.32] you [ __ ]
[1051.28 - 1056.24] until the parasite's gone
[1054.32 - 1058.64] it's one or the other you are the
[1056.24 - 1060.40] parasite there's no living your life
[1058.64 - 1062.24] slowly getting sick with neurological
[1060.40 - 1065.20] symptoms and then getting
[1062.24 - 1066.96] and then that's a parasite
[1065.20 - 1069.04] living your life with these parasites in
[1066.96 - 1071.04] you and you know you're slowly getting
[1069.04 - 1072.64] sick and you've got neurological fatigue
[1071.04 - 1075.52] and you've got problems
[1072.64 - 1077.76] galore and you've got eye floaters and
[1075.52 - 1079.12] body pain and you're going now to fancy
[1077.76 - 1080.80] functional medicine doctor he's like
[1079.12 - 1082.88] well you got parasites we're doing a
[1080.80 - 1084.24] stool simple sample and you got parasite
[1082.88 - 1085.60] no
[1084.24 - 1087.20] no
[1085.60 - 1088.80] no
[1087.20 - 1090.64] not how it works
[1088.80 - 1092.64] what you really have
[1090.64 - 1096.00] are viruses
[1092.64 - 1098.64] not parasites which really have
[1096.00 - 1102.40] are viruses
[1098.64 - 1105.28] the herpetic family is the one that's
[1102.40 - 1106.88] the epidemic of all time
[1105.28 - 1109.36] everybody's epstein-barr side of
[1106.88 - 1111.68] megaloviruses everybody's hhv sixes
[1109.36 - 1114.80] everybody's simplex ones and twos giving
[1111.68 - 1116.48] them all the neurological problems
[1114.80 - 1117.84] the brain fog the sicknesses and
[1116.48 - 1121.68] everything else
[1117.84 - 1124.08] okay and then to boot you can have
[1121.68 - 1125.76] some streptococcus three four varieties
[1124.08 - 1128.00] of strep
[1125.76 - 1129.60] and what happens is that's why people
[1128.00 - 1132.00] are sick
[1129.60 - 1135.20] they're sick from these things
[1132.00 - 1136.72] so the parasite trap is a trap
[1135.20 - 1138.88] is what it is
[1136.72 - 1141.28] it's a trap that started because nobody
[1138.88 - 1142.80] knew why anyone was sick
[1141.28 - 1144.48] alternative practitioners didn't know
[1142.80 - 1145.84] why anybody's sick conventional doctors
[1144.48 - 1148.48] certainly didn't know why everybody was
[1145.84 - 1149.52] sick with chronic mystery illness nobody
[1148.48 - 1150.96] knew
[1149.52 - 1152.24] nobody knew
[1150.96 - 1155.68] right
[1152.24 - 1158.56] and so theories evolved candida the
[1155.68 - 1160.56] candida trap right oh it's gotta be
[1158.56 - 1162.32] candida better just try to kill all your
[1160.56 - 1164.08] candida oh wait a minute maybe it's
[1162.32 - 1167.20] parasites you better just try to kill
[1164.08 - 1167.20] off all your parasites
[1167.52 - 1173.60] so let's start jump you know let's start
[1169.36 - 1175.52] dude maybe it's mold mold's a trigger
[1173.60 - 1177.28] is what mold is
[1175.52 - 1179.20] that's a trigger
[1177.28 - 1181.04] that's why someone else in the household
[1179.20 - 1183.44] can eat all the mold they want oh my god
[1181.04 - 1185.36] my husband can get all the mold he wants
[1183.44 - 1186.56] he's living in the same house i'm in i'm
[1185.36 - 1188.72] bedridden
[1186.56 - 1190.88] as his wife
[1188.72 - 1192.80] i'm bedridden i can't get out of bed i
[1190.88 - 1195.12] can't i can't function i have brain fog
[1192.80 - 1196.96] that's killing me my husband he's just
[1195.12 - 1199.12] coming and going he's eating the mold
[1196.96 - 1200.40] he's breathing the mold
[1199.12 - 1203.20] because he
[1200.40 - 1205.52] doesn't have the things in his body
[1203.20 - 1208.08] the other person has
[1205.52 - 1211.20] see how mold works molds a trigger to
[1208.08 - 1213.44] lower your immune system so viruses come
[1211.20 - 1215.68] out to play
[1213.44 - 1215.68] right
[1216.08 - 1219.28] so we go on these
[1218.16 - 1221.84] searches
[1219.28 - 1223.76] what is wrong with us what do we need
[1221.84 - 1226.08] well i better do the hyperbaric chamber
[1223.76 - 1227.44] i better do ozone i better do the rice
[1226.08 - 1229.76] machines i better do the alkaline
[1227.44 - 1231.68] ionizer water machines i better do you
[1229.76 - 1233.52] know laser light i better do you know
[1231.68 - 1237.12] get the stool test and maybe parasites
[1233.52 - 1238.80] parasitical cleanses let me do that
[1237.12 - 1240.72] and it goes around and it goes around
[1238.80 - 1242.64] and it goes around
[1240.72 - 1244.16] you know and if you're not sick enough
[1242.64 - 1245.76] you can play in all that and i know
[1244.16 - 1247.60] what's what you got the coffee animal
[1245.76 - 1249.76] you got the hyperbaric the oxygen
[1247.60 - 1251.76] chamber you got this and that and you
[1249.76 - 1253.68] don't know what's doing what right
[1251.76 - 1255.76] you're not sick enough so you don't know
[1253.68 - 1258.00] what's happening anyway you get sick
[1255.76 - 1259.44] enough and you get seasoned enough along
[1258.00 - 1261.12] the way
[1259.44 - 1262.40] and you're sick or seasoned enough in
[1261.12 - 1264.88] that and you've been sick chronically
[1262.40 - 1266.48] ill for a long time then make or break
[1264.88 - 1269.84] man you know
[1266.48 - 1269.84] you know when you get worse
[1270.72 - 1274.56] anyway
[1272.96 - 1277.84] it's important stuff when you think
[1274.56 - 1280.24] about it there are millions of dollars
[1277.84 - 1281.60] going in to taking out taking down
[1280.24 - 1283.92] celery juice
[1281.60 - 1286.72] just so you know
[1283.92 - 1289.20] there's all kinds of propaganda about
[1286.72 - 1291.28] you you'll have skin problems when
[1289.20 - 1294.08] you're drinking celery juice
[1291.28 - 1296.88] you won't be able to go into the sun
[1294.08 - 1298.64] that's insanity
[1296.88 - 1300.56] it's not just
[1298.64 - 1303.04] some simple
[1300.56 - 1304.36] attacks
[1303.04 - 1307.52] it's
[1304.36 - 1309.28] premeditated paid for attacks
[1307.52 - 1310.24] out there
[1309.28 - 1313.36] because
[1310.24 - 1316.32] the power of celery juice
[1313.36 - 1320.32] is such a threat
[1316.32 - 1321.92] to conventional and alternative medicine
[1320.32 - 1323.44] an incredible threat to alternative
[1321.92 - 1326.16] medicine by the way
[1323.44 - 1328.08] i'll turn to medicine people oh man they
[1326.16 - 1329.20] hate it tooth and nail
[1328.08 - 1330.72] even though there's lots of doctors
[1329.20 - 1332.16] using it their patients are coming in
[1330.72 - 1334.88] they're using it lots of people go
[1332.16 - 1336.96] coming in using it but it just really
[1334.88 - 1338.80] gets everybody's goat for a lot of
[1336.96 - 1340.56] reasons because
[1338.80 - 1341.92] it's really annoying here you are you
[1340.56 - 1343.36] don't know why anybody's sick to begin
[1341.92 - 1344.88] with you're trying to push all these
[1343.36 - 1346.96] other things on them right and then
[1344.88 - 1349.76] someone walks in and says oh just the
[1346.96 - 1350.64] celery juice is changing my life
[1349.76 - 1352.24] and
[1350.64 - 1354.24] someone and it's it's kind of
[1352.24 - 1355.84] unfathomable it's like wait a minute

[1374.56 - 1379.28] celery juice herbal medicine and that's
[1376.64 - 1381.76] what it is that's changed my life
[1379.28 - 1384.64] medical medium a medical medium
[1381.76 - 1384.64] i heard of him
[1384.80 - 1388.56] and you know and it's
[1386.88 - 1390.00] celery juice
[1388.56 - 1391.76] it's turning people's lives around is
[1390.00 - 1393.40] one of the powerful tools medical mean
[1391.76 - 1396.40] powerful tools but it's one that's
[1393.40 - 1398.72] undeniable it's undeniable the power it
[1396.40 - 1401.68] has and what it does for people like
[1398.72 - 1403.04] it's really undeniable
[1401.68 - 1406.72] and
[1403.04 - 1408.80] it's antiviral and antibacterial
[1406.72 - 1410.32] that's why people are sick it's the
[1408.80 - 1413.84] viruses
[1410.32 - 1415.36] right i think we're learning that by now
[1413.84 - 1417.36] right
[1415.36 - 1419.68] everybody being held up
[1417.36 - 1420.56] to the last whatever it's been now
[1419.68 - 1423.12] right
[1420.56 - 1426.40] just losing track of the months
[1423.12 - 1427.28] right world turned upside down
[1426.40 - 1430.88] right
[1427.28 - 1432.88] are we kind of realizing
[1430.88 - 1436.40] the same way
[1432.88 - 1438.64] you know the viral the plague happens
[1436.40 - 1440.80] all these decades
[1438.64 - 1442.40] herpes family of viruses have been
[1440.80 - 1444.56] released
[1442.40 - 1446.64] into the environment
[1444.56 - 1448.12] the epstein bars the shingles
[1446.64 - 1452.32] cytomegalovirus
[1448.12 - 1454.16] hhv-687 hhv 9 through 16 all the
[1452.32 - 1456.48] undiscovered varieties all the strains
[1454.16 - 1459.12] and mutations
[1456.48 - 1461.36] and epstein-barr is a funny one
[1459.12 - 1463.92] same thing with simplex one too and same
[1461.36 - 1466.32] things with shingles is you can have
[1463.92 - 1468.48] more than one variety and when you have
[1466.32 - 1471.28] more than one variety of those viruses
[1468.48 - 1472.56] inside the human body you can
[1471.28 - 1474.80] spawn
[1472.56 - 1476.96] a new mutation and then you pass that
[1474.80 - 1478.48] mutation on to somebody else
[1476.96 - 1480.00] they're sick with their neurological
[1478.48 - 1481.04] lyme symptoms
[1480.00 - 1483.28] lupus
[1481.04 - 1484.84] chronic fatigue syndrome me chronic
[1483.28 - 1487.44] fatigue syndrome
[1484.84 - 1490.36] fibromyalgia ra
[1487.44 - 1492.00] hashimoto's thyroiditis
[1490.36 - 1494.40] hyperthyroidism
[1492.00 - 1496.32] okay thyroid problems in general
[1494.40 - 1497.44] hypothyroid in general
[1496.32 - 1501.12] right
[1497.44 - 1503.92] these are just a few eczema psoriasis
[1501.12 - 1505.52] you need a virus in there too did a ligo
[1503.92 - 1507.92] you need a virus in there too it's not
[1505.52 - 1510.56] just the metals that i teach about right
[1507.92 - 1512.40] you need the viruses in there
[1510.56 - 1513.68] but the viruses
[1512.40 - 1515.36] right there
[1513.68 - 1518.96] are the big deal
[1515.36 - 1520.96] it's why people are sick bell's palsy
[1518.96 - 1523.68] that's the shingles virus
[1520.96 - 1526.80] trigeminal neuralgia that's the shingles
[1523.68 - 1528.32] virus but here's the sad part
[1526.80 - 1530.64] you can be suffering from trigeminal
[1528.32 - 1534.80] neuralgia have some bell's palsy at the
[1530.64 - 1537.20] same time have chronic fatigue brain fog
[1534.80 - 1538.80] go to your different doctors
[1537.20 - 1541.44] and someone will just say oh it's a
[1538.80 - 1543.60] parasite doing it and now it's just a
[1541.44 - 1545.92] guessing game and a guessing game so now
[1543.60 - 1549.84] it's just a total guessing game back to
[1545.92 - 1551.20] that and the musical chairs go on
[1549.84 - 1554.80] so
[1551.20 - 1554.80] what i love about celery juice
[1554.88 - 1560.56] is its power and what it does
[1558.08 - 1563.36] and you know trigeminal neuralgia not
[1560.56 - 1565.52] just the shingles simplex one
[1563.36 - 1567.36] simplex one can actually bring on that
[1565.52 - 1570.40] trigeminal neuralgia too
[1567.36 - 1572.00] teeth clenched inning jaw tightening
[1570.40 - 1574.40] but someone might think hey well that
[1572.00 - 1576.08] fever blister i have right
[1574.40 - 1578.32] a fever blister
[1576.08 - 1579.92] it's gone it only shows up once in a
[1578.32 - 1584.00] while when i'm stressed out and then i
[1579.92 - 1586.96] get this fever blister it's simplex one
[1584.00 - 1589.84] all these viruses were raised
[1586.96 - 1594.24] they were raised in labs
[1589.84 - 1596.64] with eggs as their incubator
[1594.24 - 1598.96] and they were created
[1596.64 - 1600.32] they proliferated and then they were
[1598.96 - 1601.84] released
[1600.32 - 1604.40] purposely
[1601.84 - 1607.04] into our environment
[1604.40 - 1608.72] in many creative ways
[1607.04 - 1611.12] many creative ways
[1608.72 - 1614.80] which is why we have the epidemic of
[1611.12 - 1617.36] chronic illness today right now
[1614.80 - 1619.44] you see why celery juice is such a
[1617.36 - 1621.36] threat
[1619.44 - 1623.44] but it's a threat
[1621.36 - 1626.24] to more than conventional medicine and
[1623.44 - 1628.64] big pharma and pharmaceuticals
[1626.24 - 1630.72] it's a threat more to anti-anxiety
[1628.64 - 1632.48] medications antidepressants that make
[1630.72 - 1634.40] the world go around right and all the
[1632.48 - 1635.76] other medications and blood clotting
[1634.40 - 1637.52] medications and all kinds of different
[1635.76 - 1640.32] medications right not only is it a
[1637.52 - 1641.84] threat to all the different meds the
[1640.32 - 1643.12] opioid
[1641.84 - 1645.44] epidemic
[1643.12 - 1647.68] big pharma cells all the opioids right
[1645.44 - 1650.24] this is not just the threat to all of
[1647.68 - 1652.84] that it's a threat to the massive
[1650.24 - 1655.68] conglomerate massive
[1652.84 - 1657.28] industry the alternative medicine
[1655.68 - 1659.36] industry
[1657.28 - 1661.20] and all the different fads and trends
[1659.36 - 1663.68] that were in the past that never got
[1661.20 - 1665.36] people better like really better after
[1663.68 - 1667.60] everything they've been through and the
[1665.36 - 1670.24] money jumped into it to rise those
[1667.60 - 1672.40] things up and rise them up
[1670.24 - 1674.56] so it becomes now the war on the
[1672.40 - 1676.64] chronically ill
[1674.56 - 1678.72] because how's the chronically ill person
[1676.64 - 1680.48] gonna find their way
[1678.72 - 1684.08] especially when a whole bunch of [ __ ]
[1680.48 - 1686.32] has always talked about celery juice
[1684.08 - 1688.48] because you won't see nothing positive
[1686.32 - 1689.68] out there because no one's spending the
[1688.48 - 1692.48] money
[1689.68 - 1694.80] to write it of course you guys say
[1692.48 - 1696.88] things positive about celery juice and
[1694.80 - 1698.96] the person next door does and the person
[1696.88 - 1700.80] down the street does right and i'm
[1698.96 - 1703.76] saying things that are positive about it
[1700.80 - 1705.44] right so we're saying positive things
[1703.76 - 1707.68] but no
[1705.44 - 1710.56] industry
[1707.68 - 1712.08] nobody behind there's writing
[1710.56 - 1715.84] all these
[1712.08 - 1718.64] fake bogus articles of positivity
[1715.84 - 1720.16] and then putting it out there
[1718.64 - 1722.32] about something like they do but
[1720.16 - 1724.56] everything else like they do with the
[1722.32 - 1726.64] ionizers and they do with all the
[1724.56 - 1728.64] different other things and like they do
[1726.64 - 1730.16] with all the different gut products and
[1728.64 - 1732.32] everything else anything that anybody
[1730.16 - 1734.16] wants to sell they're in the clays
[1732.32 - 1736.08] and the coffee enemas so all these
[1734.16 - 1737.84] things get written about these things
[1736.08 - 1740.32] because the money and the engine
[1737.84 - 1742.16] involved to do would not just write it
[1740.32 - 1745.20] but to get it in the system so it
[1742.16 - 1748.48] doesn't get kicked down
[1745.20 - 1748.48] so it doesn't get kicked down
[1748.64 - 1750.88] and
[1751.36 - 1755.84] celery juice doesn't have any of that it
[1753.52 - 1757.92] just has the word on the street
[1755.84 - 1759.92] the word of the people
[1757.92 - 1762.48] how pure is that
[1759.92 - 1764.84] it's got the organic movement the word
[1762.48 - 1768.32] of the people on the street healing
[1764.84 - 1770.40] right not millions perpetuating like the
[1768.32 - 1771.84] apple cider vinegar narrative so that
[1770.40 - 1773.44] you think apple cider vinegar is what
[1771.84 - 1776.40] you need to be on when the stuff rips
[1773.44 - 1778.00] you apart and it dissolves your teeth
[1776.40 - 1779.60] the money involved in apple cider
[1778.00 - 1781.44] vinegar is
[1779.60 - 1783.52] you could not even hundreds of millions
[1781.44 - 1785.68] of dollars go into advertising that to
[1783.52 - 1787.52] shove it down everybody's throat
[1785.68 - 1789.20] yeah there isn't hundreds of millions of
[1787.52 - 1791.68] dollars shoveling shoving down celery
[1789.20 - 1793.76] just down your throat it's a threat to
[1791.68 - 1795.68] everybody else in the industries
[1793.76 - 1797.60] so it becomes this thing where
[1795.68 - 1799.44] it's underground
[1797.60 - 1803.44] it's like one of those things it's
[1799.44 - 1803.44] incredible really every last bit of it
[1803.60 - 1810.16] you guys if this this sale was actually
[1806.24 - 1814.64] coming to an end probably pretty soon
[1810.16 - 1814.64] um this is the mm-900 hps
[1815.04 - 1820.16] i love this juicer i love it okay
[1818.72 - 1822.72] and
[1820.16 - 1825.44] you get 50 off on it right now
[1822.72 - 1828.08] comes with a celery juice book right
[1825.44 - 1831.28] but i want to tell you like
[1828.08 - 1832.72] what i love about this juicer
[1831.28 - 1834.84] if you got it then you know what i'm
[1832.72 - 1838.40] talking about it's quiet
[1834.84 - 1839.60] right i love that
[1838.40 - 1841.84] but
[1839.60 - 1844.72] and i just i hear about it all the time
[1841.84 - 1845.84] right now is people are buying less
[1844.72 - 1848.00] celery
[1845.84 - 1850.40] it adds up and then you end up paying
[1848.00 - 1851.60] for your juicer
[1850.40 - 1852.47] okay
[1851.60 - 1854.80] and
[1852.47 - 1856.88] [Applause]
[1854.80 - 1859.44] how cool is that right
[1856.88 - 1860.56] i get asked every day what juicer do i
[1859.44 - 1863.60] use
[1860.56 - 1865.68] all the time okay and you can use any
[1863.60 - 1867.92] juicer you can use your own juicer if
[1865.68 - 1870.40] you want whatever like if you or any
[1867.92 - 1872.40] juicer juicing celery juice is
[1870.40 - 1875.20] incredible
[1872.40 - 1878.00] this is a cold pressed juicer the pulp
[1875.20 - 1881.52] comes out dry
[1878.00 - 1881.52] so the pulp comes out dry
[1882.16 - 1885.52] and
[1883.04 - 1888.08] that matters because if you have to buy
[1885.52 - 1889.68] two heads of celery
[1888.08 - 1892.40] now
[1889.68 - 1894.16] i have to only buy one or
[1892.40 - 1896.88] if you're someone that has to buy six
[1894.16 - 1899.04] heads or something for the week or eight
[1896.88 - 1901.48] heads of celery for the week
[1899.04 - 1902.88] right you might be buying five
[1901.48 - 1904.96] [Music]
[1902.88 - 1907.20] instead of eight or something right
[1904.96 - 1908.72] three extra heads on the house that's
[1907.20 - 1911.04] how it works and that's what this juicer
[1908.72 - 1914.00] does it's like three extra heads of
[1911.04 - 1915.76] celery that goes in the bank and then it
[1914.00 - 1917.28] adds up it's another two dollars here
[1915.76 - 1918.64] another two dollars another five dollars
[1917.28 - 1919.92] here then eight dollars another ten
[1918.64 - 1921.28] dollars here next thing you know you
[1919.92 - 1922.56] paid for the juicer over again and
[1921.28 - 1924.40] you're like what
[1922.56 - 1926.96] and that's what i love about the juicer
[1924.40 - 1929.04] it pays for itself i'm pretty sure this
[1926.96 - 1933.28] one from my calculations has paid for
[1929.04 - 1933.28] itself way over a dozen times
[1933.44 - 1936.88] and
[1934.40 - 1939.20] that extra money you can buy other food
[1936.88 - 1941.60] so not only do you have their medicine
[1939.20 - 1944.16] but you're saving extra money to buy
[1941.60 - 1945.92] your other food right so not only do you
[1944.16 - 1948.40] have your herbal medicine but you're
[1945.92 - 1950.32] saving you're saving money
[1948.40 - 1951.76] to you know
[1950.32 - 1953.84] to buy your other food and that's what i
[1951.76 - 1954.88] love about the juicer that's like one
[1953.84 - 1956.72] thing there
[1954.88 - 1958.40] you know and
[1956.72 - 1960.32] i got a lot of reasons why i like it
[1958.40 - 1964.00] like the other thing is doesn't have the
[1960.32 - 1967.20] metal gears grinding into each other
[1964.00 - 1969.60] then the centrifuge ones burns
[1967.20 - 1971.52] it the centrifuge ones where it's just
[1969.60 - 1972.88] like they make all that noise and you're
[1971.52 - 1975.44] running it down the chute and it's
[1972.88 - 1977.92] spitting out right and all that well
[1975.44 - 1979.52] those centrifuges right
[1977.92 - 1981.84] they're burning the juice so they're
[1979.52 - 1983.92] heating it up and just kind of scorching
[1981.84 - 1985.68] it
[1983.92 - 1987.68] and i'm not a fan of that
[1985.68 - 1989.92] this is a cold pressed juicer but then
[1987.68 - 1991.36] somebody be like wow there's better cold
[1989.92 - 1993.20] pressed juicers out there oh really
[1991.36 - 1995.44] because those are the metal gears
[1993.20 - 1997.28] rubbing against each other
[1995.44 - 2000.08] so uh
[1997.28 - 2001.84] it's not better than this
[2000.08 - 2004.48] [Music]
[2001.84 - 2006.40] and so that's why i really love this one
[2004.48 - 2008.72] i love the fact it's quiet because i
[2006.40 - 2010.80] juice really early in the morning
[2008.72 - 2012.64] or i'll juice before i go to bed so if
[2010.80 - 2013.92] i'm working on the book you guys like if
[2012.64 - 2015.68] i'm working the book till four in the
[2013.92 - 2017.20] morning or something
[2015.68 - 2020.40] and
[2017.20 - 2021.44] i don't want to wake up the house
[2020.40 - 2024.24] so
[2021.44 - 2026.56] i could juice at 4 30 in the morning
[2024.24 - 2028.40] before i even went to bed
[2026.56 - 2030.40] after working on the book
[2028.40 - 2034.96] and not wake up the house and then get a
[2030.40 - 2034.96] celery juice in me as i'm going to sleep
[2036.08 - 2041.20] i know that's not a healthy lifestyle
[2039.84 - 2043.04] the celery just parts a healthy
[2041.20 - 2046.08] lifestyle but i know
[2043.04 - 2047.76] going to sleep at 4 30
[2046.08 - 2049.52] in the morning or five in the morning
[2047.76 - 2051.12] it's not a healthy lifestyle but i've
[2049.52 - 2052.72] had to do it a lot when writing the book
[2051.12 - 2054.48] because once then when you're in the
[2052.72 - 2055.44] groove and
[2054.48 - 2057.28] you're listening to the spirit of
[2055.44 - 2058.72] compassion and getting this incredible
[2057.28 - 2060.32] information down
[2058.72 - 2061.76] sometimes you just don't want to quit
[2060.32 - 2064.00] for the day
[2061.76 - 2066.00] you want to get as much as you can
[2064.00 - 2067.76] but yeah
[2066.00 - 2069.76] and then you know wake up eight o'clock
[2067.76 - 2072.32] in the morning after that and then start
[2069.76 - 2074.32] all over again
[2072.32 - 2075.60] but i love the juice for a lot of these
[2074.32 - 2077.68] reasons
[2075.60 - 2078.80] um
[2077.68 - 2080.56] look
[2078.80 - 2082.16] if everybody
[2080.56 - 2084.24] was all set with their juicer and they
[2082.16 - 2087.52] weren't asking about it
[2084.24 - 2090.16] be great i probably have more time to
[2087.52 - 2092.08] do some other stuff right
[2090.16 - 2093.76] but right after the sale everybody's
[2092.08 - 2095.92] gonna say where can i get a juicer and
[2093.76 - 2098.52] then they're paying full price
[2095.92 - 2098.71] and then i'm like oh god i feel bad
[2098.52 - 2100.88] [Music]
[2098.71 - 2102.72] [Applause]
[2100.88 - 2104.40] so when there's a sale on the juicer i
[2102.72 - 2106.32] just want to let you guys know because
[2104.40 - 2108.32] this way look maybe we can get some
[2106.32 - 2110.00] people that don't have to pay full price
[2108.32 - 2112.48] don't feel good about it
[2110.00 - 2114.48] it's 50 off right now and at the same
[2112.48 - 2116.96] time you know the celery just broken two
[2114.48 - 2119.44] glass bottles for free
[2116.96 - 2119.44] with it
[2119.52 - 2122.24] but
[2120.48 - 2123.79] all right we got plenty there plenty of
[2122.24 - 2124.54] celery juice right there
[2123.79 - 2126.08] [Music]
[2124.54 - 2127.92] [Applause]
[2126.08 - 2129.12] give you some tips tips that i've always
[2127.92 - 2131.04] given you and i'll talk about what it
[2129.12 - 2132.88] does for you too i want to run it by i
[2131.04 - 2134.32] think i want to go deeper into that a
[2132.88 - 2136.48] little bit about the celery juice and
[2134.32 - 2139.52] why it's so important so go into a
[2136.48 - 2141.44] deeper on a deeper level okay
[2139.52 - 2143.84] which is really great
[2141.44 - 2148.24] i'll strain it first you want to strain
[2143.84 - 2150.48] it first of all this pulp right it's dry
[2148.24 - 2152.08] and i you know i was at my friend's
[2150.48 - 2154.40] house the other day
[2152.08 - 2156.80] and he had a different juicer
[2154.40 - 2159.76] and it was it was just spitting out all
[2156.80 - 2161.60] the wet pulp became a wet mush in there
[2159.76 - 2163.60] and then what he had to do is he had to
[2161.60 - 2164.88] take that pulp and he had to put it back
[2163.60 - 2167.36] on the machine
[2164.88 - 2169.28] and it didn't give him really much juice
[2167.36 - 2172.08] after that but it still came out sloppy
[2169.28 - 2173.92] and wet i said you can stick it back in
[2172.08 - 2175.68] over and over again all you want but it
[2173.92 - 2177.44] doesn't have that same it doesn't have
[2175.68 - 2179.52] that design to actually squeeze the
[2177.44 - 2181.52] juice out so he gave up because it was
[2179.52 - 2183.04] just coming out wet and sloppy
[2181.52 - 2184.72] and just coming out wet and sloppy what
[2183.04 - 2187.60] what that was what it's doing it was
[2184.72 - 2189.60] terrible right and so that's dry there's
[2187.60 - 2191.76] no juice on the bottom of this it's like
[2189.60 - 2193.68] dust that the stuff just comes out like
[2191.76 - 2195.36] you know and
[2193.68 - 2196.16] so that's important
[2195.36 - 2198.24] um
[2196.16 - 2200.16] it's like basically air dry the hole
[2198.24 - 2203.68] which i love
[2200.16 - 2203.68] gotta strain it okay
[2204.56 - 2206.80] so
[2209.84 - 2212.64] doing that now
[2213.52 - 2217.68] seems like i'm spilling this one for
[2215.52 - 2219.04] some reason i haven't spilled it in like
[2217.68 - 2221.04] a week
[2219.04 - 2222.64] when i'm making it every morning
[2221.04 - 2225.60] but i lost a little
[2222.64 - 2225.60] i'm gonna do that
[2225.76 - 2229.28] so how about if i just get everything
[2227.76 - 2231.20] moved out of the way so i don't there
[2229.28 - 2232.48] you go
[2231.20 - 2234.72] tip
[2232.48 - 2236.08] don't don't strain it
[2234.72 - 2238.56] while you're trying to do it over the
[2236.08 - 2242.08] juicer like that make yourself some room
[2238.56 - 2243.92] so you don't make a mess
[2242.08 - 2246.72] try to do some weird thing when you got
[2243.92 - 2246.72] the juicer right there
[2248.00 - 2250.72] simple as that
[2251.28 - 2253.92] i should have probably moved the juicer
[2252.64 - 2256.32] out of the way
[2253.92 - 2258.64] giving myself some space so i wouldn't
[2256.32 - 2259.60] make a mess
[2258.64 - 2260.64] so
[2259.60 - 2262.24] these are some of the things i love
[2260.64 - 2263.12] about the juicer which is incredible
[2262.24 - 2266.08] right
[2263.12 - 2268.84] so let's talk about like what it does
[2266.08 - 2272.16] for us okay
[2268.84 - 2274.32] so why do it
[2272.16 - 2276.72] it's like why do it okay so i have that
[2274.32 - 2276.72] right there
[2277.60 - 2281.85] just cut into that a little bit i want
[2279.52 - 2283.36] to get this over here
[2281.85 - 2284.48] [Music]
[2283.36 - 2285.44] okay i'm going to give you a couple of
[2284.48 - 2287.12] different
[2285.44 - 2288.80] rundowns on why the cellar is just so
[2287.12 - 2291.12] good we're going to talk about the heart
[2288.80 - 2292.40] a little bit too as well
[2291.12 - 2295.36] so
[2292.40 - 2297.60] why are people easily blood clotting
[2295.36 - 2299.68] people have been blood clotting for
[2297.60 - 2301.92] decades and decades
[2299.68 - 2304.08] and decades okay
[2301.92 - 2307.52] and one of the reasons why they blood
[2304.08 - 2310.24] clot if they have any toxins or poisons
[2307.52 - 2311.44] inside their blood
[2310.24 - 2315.12] right
[2311.44 - 2316.56] and the blood is too thick
[2315.12 - 2318.32] they're gonna get set up for a blood
[2316.56 - 2319.68] clot
[2318.32 - 2322.08] they're gonna be
[2319.68 - 2324.96] eligible for a blood clot that's
[2322.08 - 2327.04] important to know so when the blood
[2324.96 - 2328.72] is too thick
[2327.04 - 2331.20] and then you have a buildup of too many
[2328.72 - 2332.48] toxins too many poisons
[2331.20 - 2334.56] right
[2332.48 - 2336.16] chronic dehydration
[2334.56 - 2338.96] that's another thing too
[2336.16 - 2341.68] and too much fat floating around or
[2338.96 - 2343.12] stuck inside the arteries the heart okay
[2341.68 - 2344.96] and all through the body and in the
[2343.12 - 2346.32] veins you're gonna get set up for a
[2344.96 - 2347.92] blood clot
[2346.32 - 2350.32] celery juice
[2347.92 - 2352.72] not only hydrates properly because it's
[2350.32 - 2355.04] a complete electrolyte right not only
[2352.72 - 2357.28] does it hydrate properly
[2355.04 - 2357.28] okay
[2357.36 - 2361.68] but
[2358.72 - 2364.56] it's a natural blood thinner
[2361.68 - 2366.08] without it being ever a problem
[2364.56 - 2369.04] what that means is
[2366.08 - 2372.64] it starts to break up that fat meaning
[2369.04 - 2374.48] start to dissolve fatty deposits
[2372.64 - 2376.72] that shouldn't be there the fatty
[2374.48 - 2378.48] deposits that actually cause
[2376.72 - 2381.68] problems blood clots other things like
[2378.48 - 2383.52] that so it's it's the cleaner upper
[2381.68 - 2385.12] where it starts to dissolve
[2383.52 - 2387.92] the poison
[2385.12 - 2390.80] it starts to neutralize it it even binds
[2387.92 - 2394.24] on to it to pull it out
[2390.80 - 2396.40] and that alone is like incredible really
[2394.24 - 2398.64] right there that's that's the winner
[2396.40 - 2400.24] right there all on its own it's cleaning
[2398.64 - 2401.44] your blood
[2400.24 - 2403.92] there's a whole bunch of people there
[2401.44 - 2405.68] like lymphatic lymphatic lymphatic
[2403.92 - 2407.36] system got to do my lymphatic massage
[2405.68 - 2409.36] got to do my lymphatic drainage i'm
[2407.36 - 2410.88] going to do my lymphatic therapies i got
[2409.36 - 2411.92] somebody who knows all about lymphatic
[2410.88 - 2413.52] they're going to give me all kinds of
[2411.92 - 2415.28] tonics i'm like okay well where's the
[2413.52 - 2417.04] celery juice
[2415.28 - 2418.72] because you can do all the lymphatic
[2417.04 - 2420.32] stuff you want you can do all your
[2418.72 - 2421.60] little lymphatic lenses and all your
[2420.32 - 2423.36] different tricks and you can do your
[2421.60 - 2425.92] massage too
[2423.36 - 2427.36] but you can't clean that lymphatic
[2425.92 - 2429.28] system up
[2427.36 - 2430.88] until you use like tools that really
[2429.28 - 2432.32] work like celery juice is one of those
[2430.88 - 2434.88] tools that's why people start getting
[2432.32 - 2436.32] better another another reason why
[2434.88 - 2437.76] celery juice works on cleaning up the
[2436.32 - 2439.44] lymphatic system is because it's fixing
[2437.76 - 2441.28] the liver
[2439.44 - 2442.80] your lymphatic system's only as good as
[2441.28 - 2444.64] your liver
[2442.80 - 2446.96] you have a dirty liver and that's not
[2444.64 - 2448.48] being fixed your lymphatic system is
[2446.96 - 2450.40] going to be never ending it's going to
[2448.48 - 2452.08] be the never ending trash pile like the
[2450.40 - 2454.48] garbage patch out on the west coast
[2452.08 - 2456.72] right in the pacific
[2454.48 - 2459.52] it's now way bigger than texas
[2456.72 - 2461.84] it's far bigger and it's moving now to a
[2459.52 - 2463.52] point where it's pushing to the coast
[2461.84 - 2465.04] to the west coast
[2463.52 - 2467.28] the problem with the garbage patch
[2465.04 - 2469.04] pushing to the west coast
[2467.28 - 2470.48] is it squeezing out the wildlife so
[2469.04 - 2473.04] people are starting to see wildlife
[2470.48 - 2475.84] that's not supposed to live on the coast
[2473.04 - 2478.72] so i was talking to a friend of mine
[2475.84 - 2480.80] and he said he saw wildlife studies fish
[2478.72 - 2483.68] he says he saw fish that live way out
[2480.80 - 2485.92] there and don't live on the coast
[2483.68 - 2486.96] and they're finding fish that's pushed
[2485.92 - 2489.20] out
[2486.96 - 2491.28] so because the garbage patch is now
[2489.20 - 2493.20] moving to such a rate right well if your
[2491.28 - 2494.40] liver is that toxic like the garbage
[2493.20 - 2496.72] patch
[2494.40 - 2498.88] and it's that filled up with junk and
[2496.72 - 2500.08] stagnity and all kinds of toxins and
[2498.88 - 2502.80] everything else
[2500.08 - 2505.52] your lymphatic system
[2502.80 - 2507.68] is part of that garbage patch
[2505.52 - 2508.96] you you can clean the lymphatic all you
[2507.68 - 2510.48] want
[2508.96 - 2512.16] you can do all the cleansers and things
[2510.48 - 2513.68] that are you know all theoretical or
[2512.16 - 2516.08] whatever you want to do
[2513.68 - 2518.16] but unless you clean up the liver
[2516.08 - 2520.48] it's not going to happen
[2518.16 - 2522.24] it's just not it's like cleaning up the
[2520.48 - 2523.84] coast it's like walking on the west
[2522.24 - 2526.16] coast right now on the beach and
[2523.84 - 2528.32] cleaning up garbage meanwhile there's
[2526.16 - 2529.84] this massive monstrosity out in the
[2528.32 - 2531.68] water in the pacific that's just
[2529.84 - 2534.48] gobbling everything up no one's going
[2531.68 - 2537.36] out there to clean that up
[2534.48 - 2539.68] and that's the liver
[2537.36 - 2541.52] that's the monstrosity problem of all
[2539.68 - 2543.60] the junk and garbage that's where it
[2541.52 - 2545.04] really is centered for everybody you got
[2543.60 - 2546.16] weight gain that's coming on and you
[2545.04 - 2548.56] can't get rid of that weight gain or
[2546.16 - 2550.32] that weight gain's problematic
[2548.56 - 2552.00] and you're doing everything you can but
[2550.32 - 2553.52] you know you can barely control the
[2552.00 - 2556.24] weight gain
[2553.52 - 2558.08] that's the liver saying hey i had enough
[2556.24 - 2559.60] i'm filled with toxins i'm filled with
[2558.08 - 2561.52] poisons i'm filled with all kinds of
[2559.60 - 2562.48] trouble all kinds of different things
[2561.52 - 2564.24] and
[2562.48 - 2567.20] petrochemicals and solvents and
[2564.24 - 2569.28] everything else metals
[2567.20 - 2570.56] everything's in there right perfumes
[2569.28 - 2572.40] colognes
[2570.56 - 2574.96] all of it and
[2572.40 - 2576.88] so how do we clean up that liver
[2574.96 - 2578.80] including any kind of viral sludge or
[2576.88 - 2580.24] things like that in there
[2578.80 - 2582.00] how do we clean up the liver well celery
[2580.24 - 2583.84] juice is actually one of those things so
[2582.00 - 2585.76] now you're you're hitting you're
[2583.84 - 2588.72] pinpointing
[2585.76 - 2590.56] you're doing pinpoint
[2588.72 - 2592.16] you're locking it down
[2590.56 - 2594.80] you're actually locking it down you're
[2592.16 - 2596.00] using the celery juice to go into the
[2594.80 - 2598.08] liver
[2596.00 - 2599.20] start cleaning up that garbage patch
[2598.08 - 2601.04] right there
[2599.20 - 2602.64] and then the lymphatic system actually
[2601.04 - 2605.52] lymphatic system actually that's the
[2602.64 - 2607.60] next that just naturally starts to clean
[2605.52 - 2609.60] up
[2607.60 - 2612.24] it's why you could be 40 something years
[2609.60 - 2614.16] old and you've like eaten really lean
[2612.24 - 2616.64] meats or or you're vegan and you're
[2614.16 - 2618.88] eating you know good quality vegan food
[2616.64 - 2620.48] and you're working out you're exercising
[2618.88 - 2622.24] and then you die of a heart attack
[2620.48 - 2623.68] happens every day
[2622.24 - 2626.08] every day
[2623.68 - 2627.76] and you're like this guy that's running
[2626.08 - 2629.28] on a treadmill
[2627.76 - 2630.64] pushing weights
[2629.28 - 2632.72] in great shape
[2630.64 - 2634.48] dies of a heart attack at 42 years old
[2632.72 - 2636.16] you think that's just one guy out of 10
[2634.48 - 2639.44] 000. oh my god it's so many guys it's
[2636.16 - 2640.64] unbelievable and women too
[2639.44 - 2642.88] and
[2640.64 - 2645.52] because we're not addressing the real
[2642.88 - 2647.60] issue the center that storm in the
[2645.52 - 2649.68] center here right so celery juice is
[2647.60 - 2651.20] that great weapon that great tool you
[2649.68 - 2652.32] can use every single day so when you're
[2651.20 - 2654.56] drinking your celery juice you're like
[2652.32 - 2656.96] you're really cleaning your lymphatic
[2654.56 - 2658.72] system you're really cleaning your liver
[2656.96 - 2661.04] that's just you know yeah it's one of
[2658.72 - 2664.16] the medical medium tools there's others
[2661.04 - 2665.60] too you can combine
[2664.16 - 2668.40] but that one right there is really
[2665.60 - 2670.48] important and there's good reason for it
[2668.40 - 2672.00] and then your intestinal tract
[2670.48 - 2673.68] so you go to the functional medicine
[2672.00 - 2676.48] doctor and he's going to be caught onto
[2673.68 - 2677.84] the trends of microbiome and oh you're
[2676.48 - 2679.20] going to need all this fermented foods
[2677.84 - 2681.04] and microorganisms and that's your
[2679.20 - 2682.64] problem guess what's been done
[2681.04 - 2685.12] been done before and everybody still
[2682.64 - 2686.80] stays sick who's chronically ill
[2685.12 - 2688.32] sure if they get rid of your gluten and
[2686.80 - 2689.76] your eggs they don't know why you start
[2688.32 - 2691.20] getting better you get rid of your glute
[2689.76 - 2693.12] and your eggs and you get rid of your
[2691.20 - 2694.56] dairy you get rid of processed foods you
[2693.12 - 2696.72] might be somebody that's not sick and
[2694.56 - 2698.40] all of a sudden you start seeing some
[2696.72 - 2700.88] some benefits so you think oh he's got
[2698.40 - 2702.08] something there maybe my microbiome but
[2700.88 - 2703.52] really
[2702.08 - 2704.48] what you have
[2703.52 - 2706.96] is
[2704.48 - 2708.24] a whole bunch of different bacteria
[2706.96 - 2710.56] like the bad bacteria like the
[2708.24 - 2712.24] streptococcus and you got the viruses
[2710.56 - 2713.92] like the epstein barr
[2712.24 - 2715.84] that's why you got the brain fog and you
[2713.92 - 2718.72] got the fatigue and the sickness and the
[2715.84 - 2721.44] fibromyalgia and all the other issues so
[2718.72 - 2722.96] what happens is that when you go
[2721.44 - 2723.92] to your functional doctor or somebody
[2722.96 - 2724.88] which is great you got to have a
[2723.92 - 2726.48] functional doctor you got to have
[2724.88 - 2728.08] somebody you love but when they start
[2726.48 - 2729.84] pushing the parasite cleanses and
[2728.08 - 2731.36] everything else
[2729.84 - 2732.96] that's really not the direction the
[2731.36 - 2736.24] direction
[2732.96 - 2737.12] is going after the bacteria
[2736.24 - 2739.04] right
[2737.12 - 2741.68] with something that kills it but doesn't
[2739.04 - 2743.92] kill the good bacteria another thing too
[2741.68 - 2745.12] is a big confusion that people have
[2743.92 - 2746.56] is that
[2745.12 - 2748.56] they think you can put in all these
[2746.56 - 2750.88] microorganisms and that pushes out the
[2748.56 - 2751.92] bad stuff it doesn't they don't battle
[2750.88 - 2754.24] each other
[2751.92 - 2756.88] they're not against each other so
[2754.24 - 2760.64] bad microbes in your intestinal tract
[2756.88 - 2763.36] don't go at war with good microbes
[2760.64 - 2765.36] so you can push all the theoretical
[2763.36 - 2768.00] microbes you want or fermented
[2765.36 - 2769.20] microorganisms or probiotics you want in
[2768.00 - 2771.60] your gut
[2769.20 - 2773.60] but it'll never push out while you're
[2771.60 - 2775.60] the reason why you're sick it'll never
[2773.60 - 2777.28] push the reason why you're sick out it's
[2775.60 - 2779.28] why so many people with fatigue and the
[2777.28 - 2781.12] brain fog and the aches and pains and
[2779.28 - 2783.92] the vertigo and the dizziness and the
[2781.12 - 2785.84] balance issues and the jaw pain the
[2783.92 - 2788.48] trigeminal neuralgia the bell's palsy
[2785.84 - 2790.24] the back pain neck pain the sciatica the
[2788.48 - 2792.08] plantar fasciitis and everything else
[2790.24 - 2795.04] they don't get better
[2792.08 - 2797.84] because you can't push out a problem
[2795.04 - 2799.92] using good bacteria
[2797.84 - 2801.52] that's impossible bad bacteria and good
[2799.92 - 2803.52] bacteria don't battle each other they're
[2801.52 - 2805.04] not at war with each other they're not
[2803.52 - 2807.52] against each other
[2805.04 - 2808.88] so you can push anything you want in you
[2807.52 - 2810.40] that you think is theoretically a
[2808.88 - 2811.68] microorganism that your body might want
[2810.40 - 2813.92] to receive
[2811.68 - 2815.76] you put it in there you still stay sick
[2813.92 - 2818.96] or you keep on waving back and forth
[2815.76 - 2820.48] back and forth confused
[2818.96 - 2822.08] so
[2820.48 - 2824.56] i'm just and that's thousands and
[2822.08 - 2826.08] thousands and thousands of dollars right
[2824.56 - 2827.20] going in this specialist and this
[2826.08 - 2828.64] specialist now i got to see my
[2827.20 - 2830.08] neurologist now i'm going to try this
[2828.64 - 2831.84] new cleanse now i'm going to try fecal
[2830.08 - 2834.24] matter in plants now i'm going to try
[2831.84 - 2835.36] more probiotics now you're in and then
[2834.24 - 2837.04] i'm going to do this cleanse this
[2835.36 - 2838.24] therapy i'm going to get blood work so
[2837.04 - 2840.40] that's another thing too and then
[2838.24 - 2841.92] they'll bleed you to death
[2840.40 - 2843.28] so
[2841.92 - 2844.56] so you got to know how to protect
[2843.28 - 2847.20] yourself because the next thing you know
[2844.56 - 2848.88] it now they're bleeding you to death
[2847.20 - 2851.44] more blood more blood at the doctor's
[2848.88 - 2852.32] office more blood more blood
[2851.44 - 2855.60] oh
[2852.32 - 2856.88] parasites more stool samples more blood
[2855.60 - 2858.24] and
[2856.88 - 2861.04] now we're down another you know we're
[2858.24 - 2863.04] down a path even deeper into it
[2861.04 - 2864.64] so this is thousands upon thousands of
[2863.04 - 2865.92] dollars if you have health insurance
[2864.64 - 2868.00] okay
[2865.92 - 2869.92] i guess so a lot of it the co-payments
[2868.00 - 2871.36] alone kill people so i don't know and
[2869.92 - 2873.20] then all the different therapies are not
[2871.36 - 2874.24] covered many of them
[2873.20 - 2876.32] but
[2874.24 - 2877.52] that's why celery juice is such
[2876.32 - 2879.36] a threat and these people are already
[2877.52 - 2881.28] deficient everybody you guys know like
[2879.36 - 2882.24] everybody's deficient
[2881.28 - 2883.60] right
[2882.24 - 2885.20] everybody's deficient already they have
[2883.60 - 2886.96] blood drawn from them they're already
[2885.20 - 2890.16] deficient
[2886.96 - 2891.76] they got adrenals already deficient
[2890.16 - 2893.84] stomach lands already deficient they
[2891.76 - 2895.12] can't produce the gastric acid they need
[2893.84 - 2898.16] to produce
[2895.12 - 2899.76] everything's already deficient okay and
[2898.16 - 2901.84] people's teeth are falling apart why do
[2899.76 - 2903.36] you think all the podcast doctors all
[2901.84 - 2905.28] have fake teeth
[2903.36 - 2907.76] i have you guys figured it out yet i
[2905.28 - 2909.12] mean it's just unbelievable it's it's
[2907.76 - 2910.56] incredible really
[2909.12 - 2912.00] got all these guys there of course they
[2910.56 - 2913.28] got all their teeth done they got the
[2912.00 - 2914.72] implants and the veneers and everything
[2913.28 - 2917.28] else i'm not saying that's a bad thing
[2914.72 - 2918.16] if you want but the point is is
[2917.28 - 2920.80] that
[2918.16 - 2923.20] there's deficiencies in everybody
[2920.80 - 2925.44] everybody's running deficient rampant
[2923.20 - 2927.60] and what are we putting back in us
[2925.44 - 2928.88] i think the celery juice is incredible
[2927.60 - 2930.16] because you not only kill the bad
[2928.88 - 2932.80] bacteria
[2930.16 - 2934.40] but you're restoring
[2932.80 - 2936.32] and restoring
[2934.40 - 2938.08] so you're restoring back into you're
[2936.32 - 2939.44] putting back in
[2938.08 - 2940.80] to the bank
[2939.44 - 2942.16] and that's the key
[2940.80 - 2944.72] that's the big thing right there you're
[2942.16 - 2947.60] putting back into the bank
[2944.72 - 2949.52] and i love that you're also helping to
[2947.60 - 2951.36] not just kill off the bad bacteria in
[2949.52 - 2952.88] the gut because it neutralizes it breaks
[2951.36 - 2954.56] down the membrane of bacteria and
[2952.88 - 2958.48] viruses
[2954.56 - 2960.32] but it flushes out dehydrated
[2958.48 - 2962.24] gristle that everybody has in their
[2960.32 - 2965.84] intestinal tracts everybody has this
[2962.24 - 2967.76] dehydrated fat dehydrated gristle all
[2965.84 - 2970.00] wrapped up inside their intestinal tract
[2967.76 - 2972.00] lining they got all this gristle there
[2970.00 - 2974.24] and so it starts to break that apart so
[2972.00 - 2977.28] we end up getting rid of that
[2974.24 - 2979.20] way better than sodium bicarbonate trend
[2977.28 - 2983.20] diatomaceous earth particle
[2979.20 - 2984.48] uh trend fulvic mineral trend whatever
[2983.20 - 2986.00] and
[2984.48 - 2986.88] what happens is
[2986.00 - 2988.40] that
[2986.88 - 2990.08] we're on all these different trends
[2988.40 - 2992.56] they're being paid for out there
[2990.08 - 2994.00] non-stop lots of money going in and then
[2992.56 - 2995.44] we're told
[2994.00 - 2997.68] celery juice
[2995.44 - 2999.92] what that that's a vegetable it's not
[2997.68 - 3001.28] going to be enough meanwhile what it's
[2999.92 - 3002.64] done for people and turning people's
[3001.28 - 3004.16] lives around is just absolutely
[3002.64 - 3005.68] extraordinary
[3004.16 - 3007.20] the thing is when people get their blood
[3005.68 - 3008.56] removed constantly and they get vials of
[3007.20 - 3009.60] blood removed constantly and that's
[3008.56 - 3012.56] what's happening when we go to our
[3009.60 - 3014.64] practitioners it doesn't restore your
[3012.56 - 3016.80] immune system doesn't come back in a
[3014.64 - 3020.64] week or a day your immune system doesn't
[3016.80 - 3022.56] come back in three days or four days
[3020.64 - 3024.72] critical electrolytes don't even come
[3022.56 - 3027.12] back that fast and we're already
[3024.72 - 3029.44] deficient so we get more deficient so we
[3027.12 - 3030.88] get the blood drawn all the time and
[3029.44 - 3032.64] then we're getting more deficient and
[3030.88 - 3035.12] more deficient it doesn't just all
[3032.64 - 3037.28] restore in three days or five days you
[3035.12 - 3040.72] just can't have everything fixed you get
[3037.28 - 3043.84] the blood work we just lost critical
[3040.72 - 3046.40] needed macro minerals those don't get
[3043.84 - 3047.44] restored really fast
[3046.40 - 3049.60] and then
[3047.44 - 3051.04] our cbc doesn't get restored very fast
[3049.60 - 3053.20] because we're sick to begin with we're
[3051.04 - 3055.28] already deficient we've already have a
[3053.20 - 3057.28] low immune system we already have a
[3055.28 - 3059.84] struggling immune system if you guys are
[3057.28 - 3062.40] sick we're already struggling so
[3059.84 - 3064.00] the blood the the blood podcast blood
[3062.40 - 3065.68] draw podcast the medical mean podcast
[3064.00 - 3067.20] apple podcast is important to actually
[3065.68 - 3068.40] listen to someday when you guys get a
[3067.20 - 3070.48] chance
[3068.40 - 3072.40] that's an important thing to listen to
[3070.48 - 3074.08] but i love celery juice because of all
[3072.40 - 3075.76] the different things it does including
[3074.08 - 3077.92] helping restore the adrenals and
[3075.76 - 3079.28] everything if you guys
[3077.92 - 3080.88] are yeah i know so many of you guys are
