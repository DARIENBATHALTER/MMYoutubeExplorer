1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,759
How many people do you know who struggle

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,240
with their health? Chances are, whether

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,559
they show it or not, most of the people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,240
in your life do. And chances are, you're

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,640
one of them.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,519
Whether you're dealing with anxiety,

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,000
depression, endometriosis, acne, eczema,

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,400
autoimmune, thyroid, lime, brain fog,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,320
fatigue, or any other symptom or

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,480
condition, you're far from

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,760
alone. Living with symptoms has become

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,440
the new normal. So, no more guessing

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,840
games. It's time to get answers. Welcome

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,000
to the Medical Medium Podcast. I'm

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,879
Anthony William.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,360
We're talking about breaking twigs, a

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,680
powerful therapy, something that's

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,960
life-changing and even lifealtering in

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,800
so many ways. A powerful rewiring tool

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,320
that Spirit of Compassion brought to my

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
attention since I was a child. Now, this

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
spiritual healing therapy I talked about

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,600
a little bit in one of the spring

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,840
episodes, but like many of the spiritual

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
tools from Spirit of Compassion, this

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,040
one deserves its own episode. Get ready

27
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,920
and be prepared for this one. Get

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,920
yourself outside. It's springtime and

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,280
you can do this any time of year. Could

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,520
be spring, winter, fall, summer. Gather

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,479
up a bunch of tiny twigs. They could be

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,040
nice and small, thin, anything you think

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,320
you can break between your fingertips.

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720
We're going to talk about how to do

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,759
this, what the powerful healing

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,200
mechanisms are within it. Get yourself a

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,600
spot outside. Relax. This powerful

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,200
healing spiritual tool and meditation is

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,960
life-changing. I'm so excited. I can't

40
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,360
wait for you to experience it. I'm

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,720
getting myself in a nice good spot right

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,720
now and let's get

43
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,399
started. So, I'm sitting outside right

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,399
now and it's springtime. I just saw a

45
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,479
baby squirrel run across the lawn. I

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
hear the

47
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,120
birds. Beautiful sounds of spring. So,

48
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,840
now I'm going to get up and take a walk.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
And I'm going to look for the right

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,720
twigs. You don't want the twigs too

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,520
thick. You don't want them where you

52
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,239
can't snap them. You don't want them

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,360
where it hurts to snap them. You don't

54
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
want twigs and sticks really tough,

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
really thick, where you're hurting your

56
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
hands or your wrists, or you're

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,760
struggling or straining to snap the

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,720
twigs. It's not about taking big sticks

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,800
and breaking them in half on your knee

60
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,280
or breaking them in half with all your

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,840
strength and all your might. That's not

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,239
what this powerful exercise and healing

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,160
spiritual tool is. You want to look for

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,560
the smaller twigs, the ones that are

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,800
nimble, the ones that can break easy.

66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,920
Sometimes so easy you can snap them with

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,879
just your thumbnail, just your fingers.

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,319
because it's not about using strength.

69
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,959
It's not about using all your

70
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,200
might. It's about barely using any of

71
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,040
that at all. So, I see some nice twigs

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,800
now on the ground right in the grass.

73
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
And I'm going to just bend over here and

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
pick them up. Now, depending on what

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120
kind of trees you have or what kind of

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
shrubbery because you can get twigs off

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
of shrubbery, too. And you're not

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,239
looking for new ones. You're looking for

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,640
old ones that have fallen. Maybe last

80
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,280
year in the fall they fell. Maybe they

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,519
fell the year before. Maybe birds

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,840
dropped them along the way. And keep in

83
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,000
mind that you're not trying to snap

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,159
living twigs off of shrubs and bushes

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,440
and trees. You're looking for twigs of

86
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,440
yester year of last year. Twigs that can

87
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,239
easily break and they're scattered

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,159
about. Sometimes a little hard to find

89
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,959
depending on where you are and sometimes

90
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,080
really easy. and many are there and

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,120
available. So, I'm walking around and

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,920
I'm looking for my twigs and sticks. So,

93
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,879
here I go. Now, some can be really

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,160
skinny skinny twigs, like really thin,

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,600
like eighth of an inch

96
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,799
diameter. If you go into like quarter of

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,360
an inch, half an inch, keep in mind that

98
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,440
you want to make sure you can break

99
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,639
them. You want to break them easily with

100
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,240
your thumbnails, your fingers. So, I'm

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,280
grabbing twigs and sticks. If I find

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,759
something that's a/ an inch

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,680
diameter, I'm making sure that it's

104
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,479
dead, you know, and it's doesn't have

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
any leftover juice in it from last year

106
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
or years before. And you can tell, you

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
know, it's a twig. You know, it's going

108
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,120
to break pretty easy. Now, you don't

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
have to count how many twigs. You can

110
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,639
just get a pile. But often I do like

111
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,040
numbers to a certain point only because

112
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,120
spirit of compassion gives me inside

113
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,680
information, wisdom about numbers that's

114
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,240
not out there. Like information about

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,320
the number nine that hasn't been ever

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,759
talked about by numerologists and so

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,520
forth and spiritualists, but I like to

118
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,039
kind of like add up the sticks. So I'm

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,759
counting them now. I'm on my fifth

120
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,360
stick, sixth stick, seven, eighth stick,

121
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,160
nine twig, 10 twig, 11 twig. And I'm

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,160
going to probably land on 18, which is a

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,080
nine, one and eight or a nine. But like

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
I said before, you can just grab a pile

125
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
of sticks and twigs. And you don't have

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,120
to have a number associated with any of

127
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,759
it. But as I'm going along, I see other

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,600
twigs I like. So I'm going to keep on

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:43,479
adding them to my bunch of twigs right

130
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:47,759
here. So, you got 19 20 21 22 23

131
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:51,120
24 25. Here's a nice one right here. 26.

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,600
And let me go over here. 27. I'm going

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
to stop at 27. Once again, I like that

134
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,120
number because two and seven are nine.

135
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,100
So, I'm going to hold that. And I have a

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,240
nice pile of

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,240
[Music]

138
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,880
twigs. Okay. So, I'm sitting back down.

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,520
I got my pile of twigs. I'm getting

140
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,840
ready. I'm getting in the frame of mind.

141
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm listening to the birds and the

142
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,160
hawks and the

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,479
geese. And now I'm going to get ready

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,759
and start this powerful transformational

145
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,520
tool, this spiritual meditation and

146
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
therapy. So, I'm sitting down in the

147
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
grass right now and you can sit

148
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
anywhere. You could sit on a porch. You

149
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,319
could even be inside a house if that's

150
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
where you have to be and you have your

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,479
pile of twigs. I'm in the grass right

152
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,479
now. I'm outside and I have my first

153
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,560
twig. Do you have yours? Now, what you

154
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,880
don't want to do is just snap the twig

155
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
in

156
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,759
half. Instead, you want to snap little

157
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,880
pieces off the twig. You can even keep

158
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,360
them intact after you snap them. The

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,000
skin of the twig, the bark, will hold on

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,720
to them, but you can also separate them

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,080
as well when you snap them. Each snap

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,720
can be as close together to the last

163
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,360
snap. They can be as close as a quarter

164
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,400
inch apart or even less depending on the

165
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,919
twig. And you can do it with your

166
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,039
thumbnail. But it's okay if it's not

167
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,039
that close and they're a little further

168
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:24,160
apart. Half an inch, 3/4 of an inch, or

169
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,639
an inch. That's fine, too. So, let's

170
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,639
start the snapping.

171
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,360
Did you hear the sound of my twig

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,880
snapping or your twig

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,759
snapping? Did you really listen to the

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,080
sound? So, when we do another one, try

175
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:54,479
to listen to each snap, each click, each

176
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,280
break of the twig. So, I'm grabbing

177
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,280
another twig. And here we go.

178
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,080
Now, you can do any speed you like. You

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,759
can do it fast, you can do it slower,

180
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,919
you can have the little twig pieces

181
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,639
dropping all over the place, and you can

182
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,639
go at your own pace. Here's a faster

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,639
one.

184
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,240
So let's talk about for the moment of

185
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,080
what it does. Every single break of that

186
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,360
twig, every single snap of that twig

187
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,839
that you hear enters your consciousness

188
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,040
and your subconsciousness. It enters

189
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,040
your mind. It enters the soul.

190
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,040
The snapping and breaking of twigs has

191
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,880
happened thousands and thousands and

192
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,040
hundreds of thousands of times in your

193
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,920
life, long before this lifetime. And if

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,320
your soul is really

195
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:27,440
old, 1,000 years, 2,000 years, 3,000,

196
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,080
4,000 years, or more, then you have

197
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,519
heard the snapping twigs throughout all

198
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,760
those lifetimes for many different

199
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:38,959
reasons and for many different ways. And

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,880
your soul harbors that information deep

201
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,600
within of every single twig that was

202
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,200
snapped. Whether it was for kindling for

203
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,000
firewood or thousands of years ago you

204
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,560
were gathering up sticks to start a fire

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
to keep warm. Or maybe it was so many

206
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
journeys through the woods thousands of

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,120
years ago and your soul has the

208
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,640
information of you stepping on twigs

209
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
everywhere and they were breaking and

210
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,760
snapping. And maybe it was for

211
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,399
protection reasons. You were in a camp a

212
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,720
long long time ago in a past life or in

213
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,040
a

214
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,880
village and there was a

215
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,800
campfire and there was an animal on the

216
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,320
outside of the camp walking along and it

217
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
stepped on twigs and snapped

218
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:27,600
them. But you've heard that sound before

219
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
and maybe in this lifetime you've heard

220
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,120
that sound before.

221
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,120
But what this therapy does, what this

222
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,720
spiritual tool does is it

223
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,000
rewires. It rewires the consciousness,

224
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,640
the subconsciousness, the brain. It

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,240
rewires the

226
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,320
soul. It fills the soul. Those sounds of

227
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,279
those twigs snapping is a cleansing

228
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,360
mechanism, a clearing mechanism that

229
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,279
improves mental

230
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,040
wellness, mental

231
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,800
health, mental sharpness. The

232
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,519
combination of feeling the twig in your

233
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,320
hand and interacting with nature on this

234
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,079
level has imprint removing powers.

235
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,680
imprint from negative experience,

236
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,640
imprint from problems that have happened

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,920
in the past, imprints from all kinds of

238
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,839
different betrayal, hardships, and

239
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,680
losses. So, the next round of twigs we

240
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,519
snap, we're going to be thinking about

241
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,360
the noises entering into our soul, into

242
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,440
our

243
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:40,040
consciousness, into our body, into our

244
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,040
physical cells of our body.

245
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,880
So, let's start with the physical

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,480
body. Get a twig in your

247
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,480
hand and let's start snapping each

248
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
piece.

249
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,000
The noise coming from the broken twig

250
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,959
and the little

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,639
snaps are entering into the cells of

252
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,720
your body. There's a frequency to each

253
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:26,000
snap. That

254
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,120
sound easily enters into our being, our

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,200
physical being, our organs.

256
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,720
our

257
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:37,120
brain, our liver, our pancreas, our

258
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,600
spleen. And each snap of the twig enters

259
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,399
into our neurons. Our electrical

260
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,560
impulses are picking up on it. They're

261
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,120
receiving information. They're sending

262
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,440
that information to each neuron

263
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,320
throughout the

264
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,120
brain. The spiritual therapeutic

265
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,639
technique enters into the physical body

266
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,120
easily. And you can feel the sound of

267
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
the twig snapping each time you snap

268
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,200
each piece. You hear the sound, but you

269
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,000
can feel the sound, too. And when your

270
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,120
fingers are holding it and it's snapping

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,800
within your fingers, it's also sending a

272
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
frequency through your hands, through

273
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,320
your arms, into your body all the way

274
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,160
through. This is a resetter. It resets

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,880
whatever's happening in your body

276
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,959
physically. Whatever frequency or energy

277
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,279
you picked up, you're resetting that

278
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,760
energy. You're bringing it back to a

279
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,000
natural state. You're using nature to

280
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,399
set the frequency. And each snap of each

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,040
twig sets a new frequency within a cell,

282
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,360
helps to reset it.

283
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,959
Now, twig snapping is so powerful that

284
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
even if you're not thinking about

285
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,040
anything, anything at all. You're not

286
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,800
thinking about frequencies. You're not

287
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,399
thinking about the soul. You're not

288
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
thinking about your physical body.

289
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,200
You're just sitting there and you're

290
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,519
snapping twigs and doing that alone. It

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
is life-changing, lifealtering. So, if

292
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,320
you're just sitting there in the grass

293
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,079
or on the porch and you're not thinking

294
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,880
about anything at all, you're just

295
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,639
snapping twigs and focused on the twigs

296
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,639
themselves and what you're hearing and

297
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,279
what you're feeling. If you're somebody

298
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,639
that had a hard night or you had a hard

299
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,120
day or you had a confrontation with

300
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,600
someone or something was just a let down

301
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,560
or you're just emotionally depressed,

302
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,199
sad, maybe feeling a little numb, maybe

303
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
you're battling some

304
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,760
depersonalization and you sit down and

305
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,160
you start snapping these twigs, it can

306
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,560
begin to break the triggers. What that

307
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,959
means is that whatever triggered you and

308
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,079
is still stuck triggering you and you're

309
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,880
still feeling it or the after effects of

310
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,760
a trigger, what the twig snapping does

311
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,720
is it breaks that trigger. It's a

312
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,959
trigger buster. It breaks the trigger.

313
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,000
Triggers tend to stick. They don't go

314
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,560
away instantly. You can get triggered by

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,560
something and then it stays there like a

316
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,760
stinger from a bee just staying in the

317
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,360
wound. So, with each snap of the twig,

318
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,680
of the stick, you're snapping a trigger.

319
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,760
You're breaking a trigger. Down here in

320
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,920
planet Earth, we often get affected by

321
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,959
toxic things. Not just toxic substances

322
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,760
and exposures that are physical toxins,

323
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,440
but emotional toxins from other people,

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,399
from negativity, from stuff they're

325
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,000
exuding, they're projecting, and they're

326
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,120
releasing releasing into the air around

327
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,600
you, releasing to you, directing it to

328
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,240
you. It's a very toxic place for many

329
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,480
reasons cuz people are very toxic out

330
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,240
there. twig snapping and breaking can

331
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,760
shift the triggers that occur from these

332
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,440
toxins, these variety of different toxic

333
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,800
energies. Spirit of compassion always

334
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,360
told me that you could use twig snapping

335
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
as a means of

336
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,920
communication. So, if you're sitting

337
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,639
with someone and you're talking to them,

338
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,959
you can snap little twigs while you're

339
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,800
talking to them. Now, keep in mind, it's

340
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,120
not like grabbing big sticks and

341
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
breaking them while you're with someone

342
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
or you're sitting there trying to break

343
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
a big stick on your knee or you got a

344
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,480
big stick and you're trying to use all

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,399
your might to break it or snap it.

346
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,600
You're taking these little tiny twigs,

347
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,480
sometimes so small and so thin, they

348
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,880
break with a very light noise. So you

349
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,600
can do it with your thumbnail and go

350
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,440
across it every eighth of an inch to a

351
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,199
quarter of an inch while you're

352
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
communicating with someone, while you're

353
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,040
talking to someone. And if you're

354
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
somebody that's really sensitive,

355
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,519
emotionally sensitive, you've been

356
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,959
through a lot, this is a way to keep you

357
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,440
strong while you're having a

358
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,079
conversation with someone. This can help

359
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
stop a trigger or a trigger reaction

360
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,240
while you're listening to what someone

361
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,240
has to say. If the person that you're

362
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,240
talking to happens to catch on or

363
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
they're wondering what you're doing or

364
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,120
they mention it and they see the little

365
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,199
sticks in your hands or the little twigs

366
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,919
and they're even hearing them snap cuz

367
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,799
some could be a little louder. Then hand

368
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,240
them a bunch of twigs. Have them do it

369
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,760
too. Offer this technique to them so

370
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
while you're having a conversation with

371
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,240
them, they're doing it as well. And

372
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,559
you'll watch how their demeanor

373
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,439
shifts. Maybe even some angst that they

374
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,439
have or anguish or something that's

375
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,200
happening inside of them they can tell

376
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,440
is coming out. You can watch it shift.

377
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,600
The communication can change between the

378
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,799
both of you. So twig snapping can be

379
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,960
done by yourself but also with others.

380
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,280
You can use the breaking of these twigs,

381
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,039
the snapping of them as a communication

382
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,600
tool, as a communication device.

383
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,000
Even before talking to someone, letting

384
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,559
them know what you're doing, preparing

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
for a talk, sitting down alone and

386
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,280
snapping twigs before you meet up with

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,200
someone and you're getting together with

388
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,360
someone. Or you're with someone and you

389
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,919
start snapping twigs together before you

390
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,160
even start communicating or talking.

391
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,720
Both you and that other person are just

392
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,360
sitting there together breaking twigs

393
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,000
and snapping little twigs. Just hearing

394
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,640
someone else snap a twig with you is

395
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,400
therapeutic on its own because you know

396
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,960
lifealtering things are happening to

397
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,360
them. Frequencies are shifting. They're

398
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,440
healing in different ways. Their soul is

399
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,960
receiving the information. If there's

400
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
somebody that's really sensitive,

401
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,039
they've been through a lot and they get

402
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,280
triggered easy. Rightfully so. So many

403
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,200
things happen in our lives. something

404
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,240
might shift in them as they're breaking

405
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,039
the twigs, giving you relief because you

406
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
know they may be less

407
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,720
triggerable. Spirit of compassion always

408
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,440
told me this is highly extremely

409
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,080
therapeutic within families when a whole

410
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,840
family gets together and they sit there

411
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,400
and they're all snapping little twigs

412
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,880
together while they're quiet or they're

413
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,039
thinking or talking in between it. And

414
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
it's even possible to find other people,

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,559
like-minded people that would like to do

416
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,080
a twig snapping get together or

417
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,679
gathering where a larger group of people

418
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
get together and they have their piles

419
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,799
of twigs and everybody's sitting there

420
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,799
focused, relaxed, and they're breaking

421
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,600
and snapping little twigs. When your

422
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,480
mind, body, and soul are being purified

423
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
from the sounds of the twig snapping,

424
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,160
from these sounds of nature running

425
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
through the body and the consciousness

426
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,280
and the subconsciousness, the mind, the

427
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,600
emotional centers of the brain, physical

428
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,600
brain, the soul. Then words change.

429
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,400
Different

430
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,400
phrases, different ways of talking and

431
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,919
speaking, different lines of

432
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,760
communication, different thoughts,

433
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,080
theories can emerge, new

434
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,280
understandings, new approaches to

435
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:58,000
things, spiritual revelations, epiphies,

436
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,039
and a way to learn about others and talk

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,280
to others and find out things about them

438
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,919
and yourself that weren't really

439
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,640
approachable beforehand. Twig snapping

440
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:12,760
gettogethers are powerful, more powerful

441
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,360
than psychedelics, than micro doing than

442
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,400
iawasa,

443
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,640
psilocybin, fraud poison. Much more

444
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,600
safer, much more real and non-damaging

445
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,360
and non-toxic. And even recording your

446
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,240
twig snapping, actually recording it and

447
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,600
playing it back to yourself is powerful

448
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
all on its own. hearing it again, not

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,559
just the first time when it was

450
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,080
happening in your hands and it was

451
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,360
vibrating through your body and your

452
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,559
bones, but also hearing it back on

453
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,000
recording. So, I'm going to gather up a

454
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,080
few more twigs right now. I'm picking

455
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
them up off the ground. I found some

456
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,559
really good ones. I like the way they

457
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,240
look. I like the way they feel.

458
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,799
So this time I'm going to direct these

459
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,280
snaps, these twigs, and breaking them

460
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,480
and snapping them and directing those

461
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,919
sounds to my soul. Connecting these

462
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,880
sounds to the thousands of times through

463
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,520
my past lives that I've actually heard

464
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,760
twigs snap and break for all different

465
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,159
various reasons and different time

466
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,039
periods. And you can do the same. direct

467
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,120
these little twig

468
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:25,120
snaps to your soul. So, as you grab your

469
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,480
twig and you're getting ready to break

470
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,440
it, I'm snapping mine right

471
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,720
now. Have it directed to your soul.

472
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,840
Think about how old your soul is. Think

473
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,799
about all the different lifetimes and

474
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,440
situations and time periods where you

475
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,159
were involved with sticks in some way.

476
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,039
Whether gathering them up for a fire,

477
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,520
clearing a pathway in the

478
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:55,120
woods, throwing a stick to a pet dog

479
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,440
that you had 400 years ago. Making

480
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,360
something decorative and carving sticks

481
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,720
for that

482
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,400
reason. Walking through the woods and

483
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:08,240
the fields, gathering food. gathering

484
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,000
herbs and berries and foraging and

485
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
stepping on twigs along the way and

486
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,360
hearing them break and snap. Directing

487
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,919
the twig snaps to your soul isn't hard

488
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,360
to do. You don't even have to think

489
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,880
about it. It could be as simple as these

490
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,840
are going to my soul and these sounds

491
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,000
are being received by my soul. Now, the

492
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,240
speed in which you snap your twigs is up

493
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,799
to you. It's whatever comes naturally.

494
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,799
It's whatever feels good. Everybody's

495
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,440
different, so they're going to handle

496
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,000
the twigs differently, break the twigs

497
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,760
differently, snap them. Some are going

498
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,159
to be faster, some are going to be

499
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,320
slower. Some days you might change it

500
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,559
up. I'm going to do it a little quicker

501
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,559
right now.

502
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,880
Now, after you're done, you can gather

503
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,520
up all the little pieces and put them in

504
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,760
your hand. Or you can leave them about.

505
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,799
You can scatter them in the yard or the

506
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,480
field or on your porch where you are.

507
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,360
You can put them anywhere you want. You

508
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,679
can save them. can put them in a jar and

509
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,679
bring them inside the house. I'm gonna

510
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,799
walk along right now and gather a bunch

511
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,039
more. When you're doing it alone, it can

512
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:45,120
be a sacred experience. A powerful true

513
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:48,320
meditation. Clears the mind, lowers the

514
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,840
stress levels, helps heal the soul. I

515
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
just stumbled across some really nice

516
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,000
twigs. Now, if you gather twigs with

517
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,440
someone else, someone you care about, a

518
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,440
loved one, a friend, a partner,

519
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,799
companion, maybe somebody you just met,

520
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,000
it can also be a sacred sacred gathering

521
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,120
of twigs and a healing experience

522
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,720
between whoever you're bringing along,

523
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,000
whoever's with you together. It can be a

524
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,039
powerful emotional healing technique.

525
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,880
Just the gathering of the twigs

526
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:23,320
themselves. Wow. Just found a whole pile

527
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,640
right here. So many to choose

528
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,559
from. Very excited about this. Hope

529
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,679

534
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,480
A

535
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:55,480
sound. A sound that's

536
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:59,320
healing. A sound that your soul

537
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,120
knows. A sound that your soul

538
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,440
heard long, long time ago. A thousand

539
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,559
years ago, you could have been walking

540
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,200
through the woods, stepping on sticks,

541
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:16,400
or gathering twigs for a fire. And maybe

542
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,000
you were carving a stick to catch a fish

543
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,559
or making a bow and an arrow. And at

544
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,200
some point you stepped on a stick and

545
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,679
you heard it snap. And maybe at some

546
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,400
point a long time ago you liked the

547
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:35,840
sound, the sound of a break, the sound

548
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,679
of a snap, the sound of a crack. And how

549
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,520
many times did you walk on a hill using

550
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,480
a stick and even down a path? Breaking

551
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,279
sticks is etched in our soul. Snapping

552
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,039
twigs is etched in our consciousness.

553
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,080
It's part of who we are from a long time

554
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:57,919
ago. Breaking sticks helps us battle the

555
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,039
hardships. Helps us get through a rough

556
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,760
ride on a ship. Clears our mind. Brings

557
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,960
us back in time. And if you're someone

558
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,919
that feels like you lost yourself a

559
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,480
while ago, you're not sure who you are

560
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,360
because it's been that hard. You feel

561
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,640
like there's a battle on the inside and

562
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,919
life seems difficult on the outside.

563
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,320
There's a powerful force between your

564
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:28,159
fingertips, a supernatural sound that

565
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,120
redirects and rewires your soul to help

566
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,159
keep it round. sitting in the grass and

567
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,520
holding a twig. You're healing yourself.

568
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,120
Remember this. Don't forget who you are.

569
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,760
You're a healing superstar. You're

570
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,720
strong. You're not subpar. Your soul has

571
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,760
traveled far. You're more than what you

572
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,200
think. Much more than what you thought.

573
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:56,600
You can heal. It's in your hands. I know

574
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,600
you understand.

575
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,360
Original published medical medium

576
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,919
information gets stolen and poached by

577
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,760
podcast doctors, social media doctors,

578
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,600
influencers, and medical clinics.

579
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,360
Medical Medium information has never yet

580
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,440
been proven wrong by medical science and

581
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,120
research. Instead, the opposite. Only

582
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
proven right and then taken from medical

583
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,640
medium published material and used in

584
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,720
the conventional and alternative health

585
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,640
communities. Medical medium information

586
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
continually sets the stage for medical

587
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,159
science to understand chronic illness

588
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
better. If you choose to share or use

589
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
the original unique content from the

590
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,320
Medical Medium podcast, books, or

591
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
Medical Medium social media, please site

592
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,279
where this information comes from so

593
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,799
others who see and learn of this

594
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,399
information have a chance to know where

595
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,159
it all originates to give them an

596
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,919
opportunity to heal so they don't end up

597
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,840
losing years of their life searching for

598
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,760
answers like so many have before them.

599
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,679
The medical medium information here on

600
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,840
this podcast doesn't come from broken

601
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,320
science interest groups, medical funding

602
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,880
with strings attached, botched research,

603
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,640
lobbyists, internal kickbacks, persuaded

604
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
belief systems, private panels of

605
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
influencers, health field payoffs,

606
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,000
trendy traps, or gathered bits and

607
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,000
pieces of gimmicky confusion. Because

608
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,840
chronic illness is exploding like never

609
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,760
before in our modern-day history, it

610
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,600
takes a greater force than us down here.

611
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
It takes a helping hand from above.

612
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
Medical medium information has street

613
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,240
cred. It's an organic movement of

614
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,000
countless people around the world

615
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
healing more healing stories of real

616
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,919
people not being paid to tell their

617
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,520
life-changing experiences of rising out

618
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,679
of the ashes of sickness and entering

619
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,279
into the light of full recovery, getting

620
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,880
their lives back, and finally healing

621
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,320
when nothing else in the world of health

622
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,320
could move the needle and get them

623
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,720
better. The information on this podcast

624
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,559
is not man-made. It comes from above,

625
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
from a higher source. Whatever you

626
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,399
believe in, whether God, the universe,

627
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,679
the light, or the creator, or if you

628
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,039
believe in nothing at all, that we're

629
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,720
just floating through space together on

630
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,559
this rock, know that the information you

631
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,320
hear on this podcast is separate from

632
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,919
all the other noise out there. It comes

633
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,480
from a different place. A pure

634
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,520
