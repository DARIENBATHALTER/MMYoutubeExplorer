[530.40 - 533.76] what is the personalization
[532.24 - 536.08] feeling numb
[533.76 - 538.80] you don't feel anything
[536.08 - 541.04] you don't you you can't connect

[545.52 - 551.28] there it's like a form of depression
[548.40 - 553.92] but yet you don't know you're depressed
[551.28 - 556.08] you don't know you're really depressed
[553.92 - 558.40] or it's a feeling of always feeling like
[556.08 - 560.56] you're missing out on something you're
[558.40 - 563.44] missing out on something you don't know
[560.56 - 566.16] what it is you're lost and you can't
[563.44 - 568.80] find yourself or find out where you're
[566.16 - 571.84] going depersonalization
[568.80 - 573.76] you feel lost all the time you feel like
[571.84 - 575.28] you're supposed to be somewhere else but
[573.76 - 577.84] you don't know where you're supposed to
[575.28 - 579.36] be or you feel numb and you're just
[577.84 - 581.12] laying in bed when you wake up in the
[579.36 - 583.04] morning and you feel kind of dread
[581.12 - 585.52] inside of you you don't want to greet
[583.04 - 589.12] the day and you feel numb these are all
[585.52 - 591.28] different versions of depersonalization
[589.12 - 594.16] smith and pepper said that's me for sure
[591.28 - 595.92] jekyll and hyde or depersonalization
[594.16 - 600.00] right
[595.92 - 601.76] so it's important to get the medals out
[600.00 - 603.36] it's a critical time this is the
[601.76 - 606.32] preliminary
[603.36 - 608.56] time to get us prepared
[606.32 - 610.32] i got everything right here to talk
[608.56 - 611.68] about how we should get prepared we're
[610.32 - 613.60] going to talk about metals how we get
[611.68 - 615.52] metals how all that happens we're going
[613.60 - 618.32] to talk about it really important right
[615.52 - 621.04] there what are your reviews on amalgams
[618.32 - 624.00] the fillings can we do heavy metal with
[621.04 - 626.72] amalgam fillings absolutely if i had a
[624.00 - 629.04] whole bunch of amalgams in there i would
[626.72 - 631.20] be doing the heavy metal detox cleanse
[629.04 - 633.12] because you're trying to get metal
[631.20 - 634.56] that's escaping so you're trying to get
[633.12 - 636.80] mercury that's escaping that's what
[634.56 - 638.32] you're doing so
[636.80 - 639.36] if you're somebody
[638.32 - 641.68] right
[639.36 - 644.32] that you got all that mercury filling
[641.68 - 647.28] silver fillings in your teeth or had
[644.32 - 648.56] them at one point in your teeth
[647.28 - 650.88] ow
[648.56 - 653.28] ow oh my god
[650.88 - 654.56] if you had if you're somebody that has
[653.28 - 656.40] all that
[654.56 - 659.60] in your teeth right
[656.40 - 662.08] or had them keep in mind that it's
[659.60 - 665.28] you're not trying to use the heavy metal
[662.08 - 668.56] detox movie to get the amalgam out
[665.28 - 671.44] you're you're using it for the bleed
[668.56 - 673.60] the bleed over right the filling is
[671.44 - 675.92] bleeding over
[673.60 - 679.20] it's outgassing
[675.92 - 681.04] out pocketing so you're catching what's
[679.20 - 682.64] leaving that's what you do when you're
[681.04 - 685.28] doing the heavy metal detox smoothie
[682.64 - 687.20] right there okay
[685.28 - 689.44] if you're somebody that had braces
[687.20 - 692.40] someday or you had braces a long time
[689.44 - 695.12] ago right so you had the braces it's a
[692.40 - 697.36] lot of metal and it gets into our system
[695.12 - 701.44] it gets into our nerves it gets into our
[697.36 - 703.92] throat it gets into our thyroid
[701.44 - 706.24] so we're trying to get medals out that's

[947.20 - 952.80] the heavy guns are they're in the barley
[949.68 - 952.80] grass juice powder
[953.04 - 957.28] they're in the spirulina
[955.68 - 960.80] powder
[957.28 - 964.48] that's a big part of getting the metals
[960.80 - 966.56] out do not get confused with okay
[964.48 - 970.32] lorella
[966.56 - 972.96] don't get confused with chlorella

[972.96 - 976.08] i'm going to let you know i'm just
[974.24 - 977.52] dropping that right now so you know you
[976.08 - 980.16] have to have the spirulina you have to
[977.52 - 982.64] have the barley grass ready barley grass
[980.16 - 986.00] juice powder
[982.64 - 988.64] not barley grass
[986.00 - 991.68] barley grass
[988.64 - 993.44] won't do the trick it has to be the
[991.68 - 996.48] juice powder
[993.44 - 999.12] that's what travels beyond
[996.48 - 1001.60] and into the bloodstream to the brain
[999.12 - 1003.36] here's how it works if you do barley
[1001.60 - 1006.00] grass
[1003.36 - 1009.76] you're not going to get the barley grass
[1006.00 - 1012.32] to the brain it's 99 of it's gonna stay
[1009.76 - 1017.12] in the intestinal tract you have to get
[1012.32 - 1019.04] the barley grass juice powder
[1017.12 - 1021.84] very important
[1019.04 - 1022.84] all right spirulina it's another one
[1021.84 - 1025.20] right there
[1022.84 - 1028.72] spirulina critical
[1025.20 - 1031.28] now this is the best stuff there is
[1028.72 - 1033.84] out there okay i'm not sponsored by
[1031.28 - 1035.84] vimergy it's just the best stuff i'm not
[1033.84 - 1037.44] an ambassador for vimorgy i'm not
[1035.84 - 1038.80] sponsored i'm not the owner of the
[1037.44 - 1041.60] company
[1038.80 - 1044.32] but the stuff is that incredible
[1041.60 - 1048.32] this is the gold right here
[1044.32 - 1049.76] it's this type of spirulina that vimergy
[1048.32 - 1051.68] actually has
[1049.76 - 1054.24] that makes the difference i'm letting
[1051.68 - 1055.28] you know okay that's the one right there
[1054.24 - 1059.28] okay
[1055.28 - 1059.28] and the stuff is incredible right

[1064.72 - 1071.76] depression anxiety and panic attacks
[1068.08 - 1074.48] medals create panic attacks unexplained
[1071.76 - 1076.32] panic attacks brianna that's amazing
[1074.48 - 1077.44] here's the barley grass juice powder
[1076.32 - 1079.28] right here
[1077.44 - 1080.56] that's where the gold is at it's not
[1079.28 - 1082.32] barley grass because i don't want you
[1080.56 - 1084.72] guys making mistakes
[1082.32 - 1087.52] one of the mistakes is barley grass it's
[1084.72 - 1089.36] different than barley grass juice powder
[1087.52 - 1091.12] so i'm letting you know this is the
[1089.36 - 1093.36] stuff this is where the gold is at for
[1091.12 - 1095.44] getting metals out right here

[1165.68 - 1172.00] this into the smoothie this
[1168.00 - 1174.72] is a metal remover in the gut okay
[1172.00 - 1177.52] that's important to know it's the dolls
[1174.72 - 1179.12] kelp doesn't do that
[1177.52 - 1180.56] i wish kelp did
[1179.12 - 1182.72] but it doesn't
[1180.56 - 1184.96] so it's and it this is incredible for
[1182.72 - 1186.72] when dolls is hard to find because if
[1184.96 - 1189.28] you can find some adults you can use the
[1186.72 - 1190.48] dolls here's dolls right here i got a
[1189.28 - 1192.88] little bit
[1190.48 - 1194.64] right but sometimes this is hard to find
[1192.88 - 1196.48] so then
[1194.64 - 1198.72] i love the liquid i just use the liquid
[1196.48 - 1201.20] anyway i'll put both in there yvonne
[1198.72 - 1203.84] says no more pms with medical medium
[1201.20 - 1208.88] protocol incredible
[1203.84 - 1211.44] that's so so wonderful it really is
[1208.88 - 1213.60] so we're talking about dolls right now
[1211.44 - 1216.16] thank you for for sharing that yvonne
[1213.60 - 1218.24] thank you for sharing that very much
[1216.16 - 1219.76] so we got the dolls
[1218.24 - 1221.20] right the energy dolls we got the
[1219.76 - 1223.28] spirulina
[1221.20 - 1224.88] memory spirulina we got the barley grass
[1223.28 - 1227.12] cheese powder
[1224.88 - 1228.96] these are the highest quality levels of
[1227.12 - 1230.40] this if you can find if you can't find
[1228.96 - 1232.96] this stuff and you use some other barley
[1230.40 - 1235.44] grass make sure it's a juice powder
[1232.96 - 1237.44] right the prevention realm good to see
[1235.44 - 1239.84] you love how gentle but powerful this
[1237.44 - 1242.48] cleanses that's the key that's the key
[1239.84 - 1245.60] right there so
[1242.48 - 1248.56] one of the reasons why the cleanse works
[1245.60 - 1251.68] is because it's powerful
[1248.56 - 1255.04] another reason why it works is because
[1251.68 - 1257.76] it's gentle
[1255.04 - 1260.24] it makes it so you can do it it makes it
[1257.76 - 1263.28] so children can do it it makes it so we
[1260.24 - 1264.08] can get metals out right
[1263.28 - 1267.60] so
[1264.08 - 1270.72] five of these ingredients work together
[1267.60 - 1272.20] synergetically synergistically they work
[1270.72 - 1273.76] together
[1272.20 - 1276.08] systematically
[1273.76 - 1278.72] to get the metals out of the brain and
[1276.08 - 1280.56] brainstem and neurons and out of the
[1278.72 - 1282.24] liver and out of the organs and out of
[1280.56 - 1284.64] your endocrine glands and out of your
[1282.24 - 1287.36] thyroid and out of your body and that's
[1284.64 - 1290.80] how people get better and move forward
[1287.36 - 1292.00] which is so important right there
[1290.80 - 1293.52] so we're talking about the wild
[1292.00 - 1294.88] blueberries that's one thing you got to
[1293.52 - 1296.64] have the wild blueberries these are the
[1294.88 - 1298.72] frozen wild blueberries but do you do
[1296.64 - 1300.16] the best you can if you don't have this
[1298.72 - 1301.92] did you try to get a wild blueberry
[1300.16 - 1303.92] powder if you don't have that try to get
[1301.92 - 1305.44] the wild blueberry juice but getting or
[1303.92 - 1306.96] if you don't have any wild blueberry
[1305.44 - 1309.60] throw some blackberries in there it
[1306.96 - 1311.60] won't do the same but it helps the good
[1309.60 - 1313.92] news is you have the other ingredients
[1311.60 - 1316.00] you have the dolls right and you have
[1313.92 - 1317.20] these other things okay
[1316.00 - 1319.36] here's the other thing you can start
[1317.20 - 1322.64] with a small amount of the smoothie so
[1319.36 - 1325.44] you can start with a smaller amount of
[1322.64 - 1328.16] the heavy metal detox smoothie you guys
[1325.44 - 1329.52] you can start with with a small
[1328.16 - 1332.16] amount
[1329.52 - 1335.60] right so when you make your smoothie you
[1332.16 - 1336.96] can do a smaller one if you're sensitive
[1335.60 - 1338.80] if you're somebody who's sensitive you
[1336.96 - 1340.40] do a smaller one
[1338.80 - 1342.32] it's incredible because it's for
[1340.40 - 1343.76] sensitive people to begin with because
[1342.32 - 1345.68] people are sensitive because they have
[1343.76 - 1348.24] all these metals to begin with their
[1345.68 - 1350.48] nerves are all jacked up that's what's
[1348.24 - 1352.40] happening so people are walking around
[1350.48 - 1354.00] their nerves are all jacked up is what's
[1352.40 - 1355.36] happening right
[1354.00 - 1357.28] and
[1355.36 - 1358.80] they got the personalization the anxiety
[1357.28 - 1361.12] they got the depression people got
[1358.80 - 1362.40] schizophrenia they got bipolar they got
[1361.12 - 1364.48] mania
[1362.40 - 1366.40] or somebody's just like
[1364.48 - 1369.44] when they're up they're like manic
[1366.40 - 1371.36] they're manic and manic and manic a lot
[1369.44 - 1372.72] of people just have anxiety and they'll
[1371.36 - 1374.40] have a panic
[1372.72 - 1376.64] and they'll have all of that to the
[1374.40 - 1378.48] panic and it feels like it feels like
[1376.64 - 1379.84] they're just all over the place all
[1378.48 - 1382.00] through their bodies so that's a whole
[1379.84 - 1383.52] nother thing right there that people go
[1382.00 - 1384.40] through
[1383.52 - 1386.56] right
[1384.40 - 1386.56] so
[1386.80 - 1390.16] i'm making some room over here
[1390.56 - 1394.96] power of compassion when i first started
[1392.72 - 1398.32] medical medium i did exactly the same
[1394.96 - 1400.16] mistake i used barley grass powder not
[1398.32 - 1402.16] the juice powder thank you for letting
[1400.16 - 1403.92] everybody know this is why i have to say
[1402.16 - 1406.48] it over and over again this is why it's
[1403.92 - 1408.64] a critical piece of this
[1406.48 - 1411.60] it can't be the barley grass powder and
[1408.64 - 1414.32] i'll tell you why barley grass powder
[1411.60 - 1417.04] is scratchy
[1414.32 - 1418.88] it scratches the lining of the
[1417.04 - 1421.92] intestinal tract because it's a
[1418.88 - 1424.16] dehydrated grass
[1421.92 - 1425.68] this is a juice powder and it's not
[1424.16 - 1428.16] scratchy
[1425.68 - 1430.88] it dissolves quick absorbs fast
[1428.16 - 1433.28] assimilates instantly it gets into your
[1430.88 - 1436.00] bloodstream fast and it doesn't irritate
[1433.28 - 1438.24] the lining of the intestinal tract
[1436.00 - 1440.00] barley grass can make somebody go oh i
[1438.24 - 1441.52] tried that medical medium smoothie
[1440.00 - 1443.04] that's awful
[1441.52 - 1444.96] wow
[1443.04 - 1447.44] and then they tell somebody else online
[1444.96 - 1448.16] like yeah don't do his stuff it bothered
[1447.44 - 1449.28] me
[1448.16 - 1450.96] and then someone else who had
[1449.28 - 1452.72] schizophrenia that could have healed is
[1450.96 - 1453.92] like okay i won't i'll listen to you and
[1452.72 - 1456.24] then they got their and then their
[1453.92 - 1457.84] schizo for the rest of their life
[1456.24 - 1459.92] marjorie said
[1457.84 - 1461.84] yep haven't had a panic attack since
[1459.92 - 1463.20] starting medical medium on facebook
[1461.84 - 1464.48] thank you marjorie for being here that's
[1463.20 - 1466.24] so important
[1464.48 - 1468.16] panic attacks
[1466.24 - 1470.40] panic attacks
[1468.16 - 1472.56] are brutal for so many people you go
[1470.40 - 1474.88] numb your arms go dumb you feel like you
[1472.56 - 1476.88] can't even leave to the next room you
[1474.88 - 1478.72] feel like you're trapped
[1476.88 - 1480.24] you can you know people pass out i
[1478.72 - 1481.76] always tell people you pass out from a
[1480.24 - 1484.80] panic attack you're gonna be okay
[1481.76 - 1486.32] because you're gonna wake up and be okay
[1484.80 - 1488.32] sue says i made the mistake with the
[1486.32 - 1490.16] barley grass at first
[1488.32 - 1492.56] still was healing with the other four
[1490.16 - 1494.80] amazing because you were then when i got
[1492.56 - 1496.72] the vimergy barley grass juice powder i
[1494.80 - 1499.04] really started to heal because you
[1496.72 - 1502.16] elevated it to that next level right on
[1499.04 - 1503.84] sues right on uh youtube thank you
[1502.16 - 1504.88] exactly did you get do you guys hear
[1503.84 - 1506.56] that
[1504.88 - 1508.88] it made that much of a difference so
[1506.56 - 1510.88] when it's the vimergy one it takes it to
[1508.88 - 1512.48] that next level
[1510.88 - 1514.64] it really does
[1512.48 - 1516.40] it does
[1514.64 - 1518.08] what i love about the vimergy company is
[1516.40 - 1521.44] they know
[1518.08 - 1524.08] they understand people's sickness and
[1521.44 - 1525.68] chronic illness and supplement companies
[1524.08 - 1528.72] don't know
[1525.68 - 1530.56] really or understand or can relate or
[1528.72 - 1533.04] anything they don't have that they're
[1530.56 - 1536.08] just like robots supplement companies
[1533.04 - 1538.40] are robots they put out stuff that are
[1536.08 - 1539.84] trendy to try to just get things sold
[1538.40 - 1541.36] there's a difference when you're
[1539.84 - 1543.12] creating things
[1541.36 - 1544.88] to stop illness
[1543.12 - 1546.48] that's an entirely different thing and
[1544.88 - 1547.92] that's what the vimergy company does
[1546.48 - 1550.72] that's why i stand behind their stuff
[1547.92 - 1552.48] 100 and i've become friends with them
[1550.72 - 1554.40] all along the way because of what
[1552.48 - 1555.92] they've done i try to become friends
[1554.40 - 1557.76] with all the other supplement companies
[1555.92 - 1559.76] but you know what they say to me we're
[1557.76 - 1563.04] not taking our natural flavors out sorry
[1559.76 - 1564.80] aw we don't want to talk to you anymore
[1563.04 - 1567.12] and then another supplement come we'll
[1564.80 - 1569.36] we'll talk aw stop telling us to take
[1567.12 - 1571.76] your sip to take citric acid out of our
[1569.36 - 1573.04] supplements go somewhere else i'll be
[1571.76 - 1574.88] like fine i'm not going to recommend
[1573.04 - 1577.12] your stuff that happens all the time
[1574.88 - 1578.80] because they don't want to come clean
[1577.12 - 1581.60] selena says
[1578.80 - 1584.24] aw i have dulse flakes is the is the
[1581.60 - 1587.04] right amount two tablespoons you can do
[1584.24 - 1588.80] you can do whatever you feel but i would
[1587.04 - 1590.88] personally i would go with you know one
[1588.80 - 1592.64] tablespoon is what i would go with so if
[1590.88 - 1595.04] that was me selena and i had the dull
[1592.64 - 1596.88] flakes i would do one tablespoon
[1595.04 - 1599.76] definitely and then there's a dulce
[1596.88 - 1601.60] liquid if you ever get the dulce liquid
[1599.76 - 1603.60] do two dropper falls of the dulce liquid
[1601.60 - 1606.08] right there but it makes that much of a
[1603.60 - 1607.84] difference i'm trying to show you guys
[1606.08 - 1609.60] how much it makes of a difference right
[1607.84 - 1610.56] let me give you a rundown on spirulina
[1609.60 - 1611.36] okay
[1610.56 - 1613.44] right
[1611.36 - 1616.24] so i used to recommend another spirulina
[1613.44 - 1618.88] company because at the time it was all
[1616.24 - 1620.96] that we had out there right
[1618.88 - 1624.56] and then i found something in their
[1620.96 - 1627.36] bottle of spirulina something that was
[1624.56 - 1630.40] not a good thing i contacted the
[1627.36 - 1632.88] spirulina company that i recommended to
[1630.40 - 1635.28] all these people for quite a while for a
[1632.88 - 1637.68] good few with a good few years right
[1635.28 - 1640.08] contact them and said it's aw the
[1637.68 - 1642.56] medical medium okay i've recommended
[1640.08 - 1644.56] your stuff for years
[1642.56 - 1647.28] to a lot of people i found something in
[1644.56 - 1649.60] my bottle i need a call back immediately
[1647.28 - 1651.44] because i need this looked at right now
[1649.60 - 1653.68] because i'm about to just boom stop
[1651.44 - 1656.16] recommending this
[1653.68 - 1658.96] and they didn't call me back
[1656.16 - 1660.56] they didn't call me back
[1658.96 - 1664.32] and that's why this is the only one i
[1660.56 - 1667.04] recommend right here and now
[1664.32 - 1667.04] and that was it
[1667.44 - 1671.92] teresa

[1747.28 - 1752.24] detox cleanse day one starts tomorrow
[1750.00 - 1754.40] day two is after tomorrow right i'm
[1752.24 - 1756.16] showing you guys what you need right um
[1754.40 - 1758.00] kelly good to see you
[1756.16 - 1761.36] i'm showing you guys what you need cena
[1758.00 - 1764.00] says cinnapang says how about bloating
[1761.36 - 1766.96] after taking heavy metal detox for over
[1764.00 - 1769.04] a half year so what it is is you got the
[1766.96 - 1770.64] bloating right that's what's happening
[1769.04 - 1772.32] it's not the heavy metal detox causing
[1770.64 - 1773.92] the bloating you have the bloating so
[1772.32 - 1775.36] you must have the bloating with other
[1773.92 - 1777.12] things you're eating other foods you're
[1775.36 - 1779.20] eating other things you're doing heavy
[1777.12 - 1782.00] metal detox smoothie is there to pull
[1779.20 - 1784.40] out the metals right that's its job to
[1782.00 - 1785.36] pull out the metals and chemicals too
[1784.40 - 1787.92] okay
[1785.36 - 1790.96] but we still have to build up your hcls
[1787.92 - 1792.96] if that was me i would want my ac my hcl
[1790.96 - 1796.00] built up so i would be doing my celery
[1792.96 - 1798.56] juice 32 ounces every day to attack that
[1796.00 - 1801.28] bloating so i'd be doing my celery juice
[1798.56 - 1803.20] right okay so the heavy metal detox
[1801.28 - 1805.12] smoothie isn't the heavy metal detox
[1803.20 - 1807.28] cleanse the heavy metal detox cleanse
[1805.12 - 1810.08] right takes it to another level plus
[1807.28 - 1812.32] there's bloating protocols
[1810.08 - 1813.76] in here so that's another thing too
[1812.32 - 1815.84] there's actually you've got to find your
[1813.76 - 1817.60] true cause of your bloating find out
[1815.84 - 1820.40] what it is learn what your bloating is
[1817.60 - 1822.80] caused from is it from your hcl being
[1820.40 - 1825.12] too low is it from your liver being
[1822.80 - 1826.96] sluggish and stagnant what other things
[1825.12 - 1829.36] do you have going on in your diet that
[1826.96 - 1832.24] are actually bogging down your liver and
[1829.36 - 1834.40] there's protocols in here for bloating
[1832.24 - 1836.40] to look at and do and add to it the
[1834.40 - 1839.52] heavy metal detox smoothie
[1836.40 - 1843.12] is not meant to be this ant type loader
[1839.52 - 1845.52] it is actually meant to pull metals out
[1843.12 - 1848.56] so you get rid of all the heavy metal
[1845.52 - 1851.12] conditions right anxiety depression
[1848.56 - 1852.64] panic vitiligo eczema psoriasis
[1851.12 - 1858.08] depersonalization
[1852.64 - 1860.48] mania bipolar ocd ptsd right it's it's
[1858.08 - 1861.67] meant to get all that cleaned up and
[1860.48 - 1863.44] fixed
[1861.67 - 1865.60] [Music]
[1863.44 - 1868.16] all right
[1865.60 - 1870.96] let's talk let's talk shop
[1868.16 - 1872.72] we're doing it how do we get metals
[1870.96 - 1874.16] right well let's finish up we're talking
[1872.72 - 1875.68] about the different things we need so we
[1874.16 - 1877.76] talked about we need the barley grass
[1875.68 - 1879.44] juice powder we need the spirulina we
[1877.76 - 1881.68] need the wild blueberries i talked about
[1879.44 - 1883.76] why it's critical to use the vimergy
[1881.68 - 1885.44] brand if you can't use the vimergy brand
[1883.76 - 1887.68] make sure you try to get a barley grass
[1885.44 - 1890.24] juice powder somewhere and if you do
[1887.68 - 1892.16] pick a spirulina i hope you don't pick
[1890.24 - 1894.24] some of the bum companies out there so
[1892.16 - 1895.76] do your best to try to get the right one
[1894.24 - 1897.12] if you can
[1895.76 - 1899.44] so
[1897.12 - 1901.20] cilantro is something that's really
[1899.44 - 1903.60] important
[1901.20 - 1905.68] and we have the cilantro right here we
[1903.60 - 1908.72] got a celery stick somewhere attached to
[1905.68 - 1908.72] it there we go
[1909.44 - 1915.20] so we got the cilantro
[1912.40 - 1918.40] if you don't like the taste of cilantro
[1915.20 - 1921.20] you got some metals sure you can love
[1918.40 - 1923.68] cilantro and still have metals but i do
[1921.20 - 1926.96] find when someone doesn't like the taste
[1923.68 - 1930.24] of cilantro they have the metals more in
[1926.96 - 1933.04] this region of their body
[1930.24 - 1935.04] if someone likes the taste of cilantro
[1933.04 - 1936.96] they may have metal somewhere else it
[1935.04 - 1939.52] could be in their brain or their liver
[1936.96 - 1941.04] or intestinal tract right it could be
[1939.52 - 1945.04] there
[1941.04 - 1947.44] okay so that's something to know
[1945.04 - 1950.32] but if someone doesn't like the taste of
[1947.44 - 1952.96] cilantro we're talking about metals
[1950.32 - 1955.84] being somewhere near the hypoglossal
[1952.96 - 1957.60] nerve okay the hyperglossal nerve in the
[1955.84 - 1959.60] mouth that's important to know right
[1957.60 - 1963.84] there so what i'm going to do is i'm
[1959.60 - 1963.84] going to move this back over here
[1964.72 - 1967.20] there we go
[1967.60 - 1969.92] nice
[1970.24 - 1973.12] so let's take a look
[1974.96 - 1981.12] a lot of people go i don't like cilantro
[1978.56 - 1982.40] i don't like the taste of cilantro
[1981.12 - 1985.36] yucky
[1982.40 - 1987.52] awful a lot of people do that cilantro
[1985.36 - 1989.60] is terrible tastes like soap it tastes
[1987.52 - 1992.00] like soap to me
[1989.60 - 1995.04] that means you got your mercury close to
[1992.00 - 1997.04] the hypoglossal nerve
[1995.04 - 2000.08] that's what it means
[1997.04 - 2003.12] you got you got your mercury
[2000.08 - 2006.48] close to that nerve
[2003.12 - 2007.92] and it's throwing off your taste buds
[2006.48 - 2009.60] right there
[2007.92 - 2012.96] that's what that means
[2009.60 - 2015.28] so many people have metal in them
[2012.96 - 2017.36] you guys like perfume
[2015.28 - 2019.28] guys love perfume
[2017.36 - 2020.88] you know when people wear it
[2019.28 - 2023.44] you smell it

[2026.64 - 2030.64] you guys like the smell of cologne

[2030.64 - 2035.60] a whiff of metals going into our system
[2032.80 - 2038.64] they vaporize in the cologne
[2035.60 - 2040.32] toxic heavy metals that cologne
[2038.64 - 2042.80] toxic heavy metals
[2040.32 - 2044.72] you guys like tuna fish

[2115.92 - 2122.40] anything copper is not healthy for you
[2120.40 - 2125.76] the trendy world of
[2122.40 - 2130.16] get copper you know canisters get copper
[2125.76 - 2131.68] water canisters get copper this
[2130.16 - 2134.32] you know what's sad
[2131.68 - 2134.32] you know what's that
[2134.48 - 2140.56] no one ever
[2137.76 - 2143.20] is held accountable or responsible
[2140.56 - 2145.20] for that person who listens and drinks
[2143.20 - 2146.40] out of a copper thermos for the next
[2145.20 - 2148.24] five years
[2146.40 - 2150.40] and they lose their mind
[2148.24 - 2153.20] from neurological symptoms
[2150.40 - 2155.44] no one's responsible in the trend world
[2153.20 - 2157.84] no one's responsible for alkaline
[2155.44 - 2160.16] ionizer water machine poisoning
[2157.84 - 2162.00] anybody who drinks out of the alkaline
[2160.16 - 2164.40] ionizer water
[2162.00 - 2167.04] machines will end up with neurological
[2164.40 - 2168.00] problems and no one's held responsible
[2167.04 - 2168.80] no
[2168.00 - 2170.84] no
[2168.80 - 2173.20] because the metal plates
[2170.84 - 2175.04] flake and that metal that the
[2173.20 - 2177.28] electricity hits inside the ionizer
[2175.04 - 2178.24] water machines oxidizes and flakes the
[2177.28 - 2179.92] metal
[2178.24 - 2181.44] and they will go insane down the road
[2179.92 - 2184.00] with heavy metal poisoning and
[2181.44 - 2186.96] neurological problems
[2184.00 - 2189.04] including tongue problems ear problems
[2186.96 - 2192.00] face problems everything under the sun
[2189.04 - 2193.44] from alkaline eyes on our water machine
[2192.00 - 2195.28] and the thing is no one's get held
[2193.44 - 2196.72] responsible same thing with the copper
[2195.28 - 2199.36] stuff and the copper drinks and the
[2196.72 - 2200.96] copper this and the copper all of it no
[2199.36 - 2203.04] one's held responsible no one's held
[2200.96 - 2204.88] responsible for the fish oil
[2203.04 - 2207.36] recommendations from all the different
[2204.88 - 2211.20] practitioners to the podcast doctors you

[2223.52 - 2229.44] and i have a lot of other doctors using
[2225.36 - 2231.20] fish oil too everybody try my fish oil
[2229.44 - 2233.44] but no one's held responsible for when
[2231.20 - 2235.60] this crap gets into the brain
[2233.44 - 2238.16] because it's loaded with methyl mercury
[2235.60 - 2239.76] homeopathic style inside fish oil i
[2238.16 - 2241.84] don't care whose fish oil is i don't
[2239.76 - 2244.32] care if a martian
[2241.84 - 2248.08] the planet mars comes down
[2244.32 - 2250.48] and says here's your fish oil from mars
[2248.08 - 2253.76] pure no mercury in mars
[2250.48 - 2253.76] it's still got mercury in it
[2254.48 - 2258.80] all right so here's how fish oil is made
[2256.96 - 2261.04] and processed
[2258.80 - 2261.04] right
[2262.48 - 2266.88] they don't use one type of fish unless
[2265.36 - 2269.84] it's something like a krill oil which is
[2266.88 - 2272.24] still loaded with toxic heavy metals
[2269.84 - 2275.44] they don't use one
[2272.24 - 2276.64] type of fish with your fish oil
[2275.44 - 2280.16] they use
[2276.64 - 2284.56] hundreds of fish hundreds of fish heads
[2280.16 - 2286.88] fishtails fish fins shark fins yep guts
[2284.56 - 2289.84] of fish all kinds of different
[2286.88 - 2292.56] by-products from the fish industry all

[2300.08 - 2304.88] of different kinds of fish all those
[2302.24 - 2307.44] heads and tails went into
[2304.88 - 2310.16] a truck
[2307.44 - 2312.88] drove to a factory to make fish oil and
[2310.16 - 2314.80] they threw it all in the same
[2312.88 - 2316.64] container
[2314.80 - 2318.72] heads and tails of different fish
[2316.64 - 2319.92] flounders in there juicy grouper in
[2318.72 - 2322.00] there

[2471.52 - 2475.76] here now so that's what you need
[2473.84 - 2477.68] so let's talk about anxiety let's head
[2475.76 - 2479.20] there now okay so we're gonna grab our
[2477.68 - 2480.80] dummy over here
[2479.20 - 2482.64] right
[2480.80 - 2484.48] now we're going to be careful with this
[2482.64 - 2486.72] dummy
[2484.48 - 2486.72] okay
[2487.28 - 2490.56] this dummy's guts are about to fall out
[2489.44 - 2494.32] right here
[2490.56 - 2496.80] so they're about to pile out right
[2494.32 - 2498.80] so you got your vagus nerve you guys see
[2496.80 - 2500.16] this on tick-tock you guys okay over
[2498.80 - 2502.72] there on youtube
[2500.16 - 2504.24] okay you got your vagus nerves
[2502.72 - 2505.12] right
[2504.24 - 2508.56] so
[2505.12 - 2511.76] your vagus nerves
[2508.56 - 2514.00] it's come out of the brain stem
[2511.76 - 2515.60] and when they're inflamed
[2514.00 - 2517.84] when they're inflamed all right right
[2515.60 - 2517.84] there
[2518.56 - 2524.24] right the brain stem down in here when
[2520.88 - 2527.84] the nerves are inflamed
[2524.24 - 2530.08] okay anxiety starts
[2527.84 - 2533.04] now your brain stem can be slightly
[2530.08 - 2534.80] inflamed with mild inflammation
[2533.04 - 2536.64] and that will create an anxiety right
[2534.80 - 2537.92] there you might even get like heart
[2536.64 - 2539.68] racing
[2537.92 - 2543.28] because of the vagus nerves receiving
[2539.68 - 2543.28] information that's trailing down there
[2543.52 - 2547.12] all right
[2544.96 - 2549.60] so that's one way the brain stem being
[2547.12 - 2551.68] inflamed or the vagus nerves themselves
[2549.60 - 2555.28] can be inflamed
[2551.68 - 2555.28] toxic heavy metals
[2555.36 - 2560.72] can cling to the vagus nerves and the
[2558.00 - 2560.72] brain stem
[2560.80 - 2564.24] keep that in mind
[2562.24 - 2566.72] all right they can cling to the vagus
[2564.24 - 2569.12] nerve and the brain stem
[2566.72 - 2571.20] toxic heavy metals can also get into the
[2569.12 - 2573.12] brain itself
[2571.20 - 2575.84] and they when they get into the brain
[2573.12 - 2578.88] itself right
[2575.84 - 2580.72] they can attach to neurons
[2578.88 - 2582.56] when toxic heavy metals attach to
[2580.72 - 2585.36] neurons
[2582.56 - 2589.60] they can short-circuit neurotransmitter
[2585.36 - 2593.68] chemicals and electrical impulses
[2589.60 - 2596.48] anxiety isn't just one size fits all
[2593.68 - 2599.28] anxiety your anxiety is different than
[2596.48 - 2601.12] anybody else's anxiety and your anxiety
[2599.28 - 2602.32] is different than anybody else's anxiety
[2601.12 - 2605.52] and your anxiety is different than
[2602.32 - 2607.76] anybody else's anxiety but metals play a
[2605.52 - 2609.60] role and this is very important
[2607.76 - 2612.00] everybody's anxiety is different you
[2609.60 - 2614.40] guys there's no anxiety disorder or
[2612.00 - 2617.28] anxiety problem that's the same in any
[2614.40 - 2619.28] one two three four person they're all
[2617.28 - 2621.12] unique and different
[2619.28 - 2624.88] that's why i like medical medium
[2621.12 - 2626.96] information it's to customize so you can
[2624.88 - 2629.12] you're going to have a different form of
[2626.96 - 2632.00] anxiety that means when you use the
[2629.12 - 2634.64] heavy metal detox smoothie
[2632.00 - 2636.32] it's geared to getting metals out of
[2634.64 - 2639.76] your vagus nerve if that's where they
[2636.32 - 2642.08] are and causing your anxiety or if your
[2639.76 - 2644.40] metals are in your brain stem
[2642.08 - 2646.64] causing your anxiety
[2644.40 - 2646.64] right
[2646.80 - 2651.76] or if your metals are in your neurons
[2649.68 - 2654.64] inside your brain
[2651.76 - 2656.16] causing anxiety so if they're inside
[2654.64 - 2658.48] your brain
[2656.16 - 2660.00] medical medium heavy metal detox cleanse
[2658.48 - 2662.08] is geared
[2660.00 - 2664.40] for the person who has them inside their
[2662.08 - 2664.40] brain
[2664.80 - 2671.52] in the brain or on the brainstem
[2668.40 - 2673.44] or on the vagus nerves themselves
[2671.52 - 2676.08] how do they how does how does have
[2673.44 - 2677.60] having metals create this when you have
[2676.08 - 2679.12] metals in your brain your short
[2677.60 - 2680.80] circuiting neurotransmitters electrical
[2679.12 - 2684.08] impulses sending down signals down the
[2680.80 - 2685.76] vagus nerves that are causing that
[2684.08 - 2688.40] problem right
[2685.76 - 2689.44] that's one right there one way
[2688.40 - 2691.28] um
[2689.44 - 2693.04] eo fruits and vegetables says i suffer
[2691.28 - 2694.16] from panic attacks following six months
[2693.04 - 2695.76] of keto
[2694.16 - 2698.96] you're not the only one that suffer from
[2695.76 - 2700.96] panic attacks following months of keto
[2698.96 - 2702.88] it felt like i was in a tornado of my
[2700.96 - 2704.72] own thoughts and the room was spinning
[2702.88 - 2706.08] haven't had one since starting medical
[2704.72 - 2708.96] medium two years ago and i'll tell you
[2706.08 - 2710.88] why because the keto diet is not
[2708.96 - 2711.84] the keto diet is a one size fits all
[2710.88 - 2713.52] approach
[2711.84 - 2715.20] terrible approach
[2713.52 - 2716.96] that's a one size fits all what you'll
[2715.20 - 2719.12] notice is medical medium information was
[2716.96 - 2720.64] only customized is the only one out
[2719.12 - 2722.00] there that was customized for people
[2720.64 - 2723.76] with all their different problems and
[2722.00 - 2724.80] then so what happened was because of
[2723.76 - 2727.52] that
[2724.80 - 2729.28] the one size fits all groups like keto
[2727.52 - 2730.64] and everybody else they decided to you
[2729.28 - 2732.32] know attack medical mediums saying
[2730.64 - 2734.32] medical mediums one size fits all that's
[2732.32 - 2736.48] funny because medical medium is not
[2734.32 - 2737.20] and never was
[2736.48 - 2739.12] so
[2737.20 - 2741.28] medical medium is not just plant-based
[2739.12 - 2742.96] it's not just animal-based that proves
[2741.28 - 2746.48] it's not one-size-fits-all just all on
[2742.96 - 2748.24] its own right there
[2746.48 - 2750.80] all right let's get going here so what
[2748.24 - 2753.44] happens is your vagus nerve runs down
[2750.80 - 2755.20] and travels down through the body and it
[2753.44 - 2757.12] attaches itself to the stomach it
[2755.20 - 2759.52] attaches itself to the intestinal tract
[2757.12 - 2761.92] to the colon it attaches itself to all
[2759.52 - 2764.08] the abdom all the organs in the abdomen
[2761.92 - 2766.64] right especially it gets down here to
[2764.08 - 2768.36] the intestinal tract and colon
[2766.64 - 2771.04] so when that vagus nerve is
[2768.36 - 2773.04] hyper-inflamed or partially inflamed or
[2771.04 - 2774.64] low-grade inflamed
[2773.04 - 2776.72] you're going to have mixed signals
[2774.64 - 2778.16] coming down and these mixed signals are
[2776.72 - 2779.52] going to come down and you're going to
[2778.16 - 2781.12] get panic you're going to feel like
[2779.52 - 2782.48] you're heart racing sometimes so let's
[2781.12 - 2784.40] take a look right here take a look at
[2782.48 - 2786.56] the heart
[2784.40 - 2789.28] toxic heavy metals inflame the vagus
[2786.56 - 2790.88] nerve or brain stem or brain creating

[2813.36 - 2818.72] exclusive video so let's go now
[2816.40 - 2820.56] so as the vagus nerve travels down here
[2818.72 - 2822.80] okay as the vagus nerve travels down
[2820.56 - 2822.80] here
[2824.56 - 2828.16] it's also sending messages to the heart
[2826.48 - 2830.16] giving you that heart palpitation of the
[2828.16 - 2832.48] heart racing so if you have panic part
[2830.16 - 2834.80] of that panic attack is your vagus nerve
[2832.48 - 2836.56] creating that heart to do this
[2834.80 - 2838.80] that's part of the panic attack right
[2836.56 - 2838.80] there
[2839.44 - 2844.40] that's what happens heart palpitations
[2841.28 - 2846.80] the same way it can send a signal to
[2844.40 - 2848.40] the heart that flips the heart like a
[2846.80 - 2850.40] fish
[2848.40 - 2851.68] like this
[2850.40 - 2853.04] and then you feel your heart go in your
[2851.68 - 2854.32] throat you're like oh my god what was
[2853.04 - 2856.16] that
[2854.32 - 2857.60] and it almost makes you cough you have a
[2856.16 - 2858.80] heart palpitation that could be the top
[2857.60 - 2860.72] of the heart because the vagus nerve
[2858.80 - 2862.80] sending a master chop power and you're
[2860.72 - 2864.48] and you almost choke
[2862.80 - 2866.32] because that heart palpitation feels
[2864.48 - 2868.08] like it went into your upper chest up
[2866.32 - 2869.28] into your throat
[2868.08 - 2872.56] right
[2869.28 - 2874.40] so you can have heart palpitations and
[2872.56 - 2876.80] you can have
[2874.40 - 2878.00] panic or just anxiety here's another
[2876.80 - 2879.44] thing with the vagus nerve right here
[2878.00 - 2880.96] with anxiety so when you have toxic
[2879.44 - 2882.16] heavy metals if you guys just rolled in
[2880.96 - 2883.28] we're doing the heavy metal detox
[2882.16 - 2884.72] cleanse starting tomorrow this is the
[2883.28 - 2886.32] preliminary we're talking about what we
[2884.72 - 2887.76] need all the stuff we need and
[2886.32 - 2888.72] everything stick around so you can hear
[2887.76 - 2889.84] that again
[2888.72 - 2891.36] but right now we're talking about the
[2889.84 - 2893.52] vegas they're being affected by toxic
[2891.36 - 2896.64] heavy metals so when we have toxic heavy
[2893.52 - 2897.44] metals like mercury and copper
[2896.64 - 2898.80] right
[2897.44 - 2900.96] and mercury
[2898.80 - 2903.52] see the fish oil mercury
[2900.96 - 2905.84] when we have toxic heavy metals
[2903.52 - 2908.40] that come from colognes and perfumes
[2905.84 - 2911.04] toxic heavy metals in our brain and
[2908.40 - 2913.28] nervous system our vagus nerve our brain
[2911.04 - 2916.32] and our vagus nerve we get mixed
[2913.28 - 2919.20] messages right down here to the heart
[2916.32 - 2921.28] causing heart to be afib mysterious afib
[2919.20 - 2924.16] mysterious tachycardia
[2921.28 - 2926.08] mysterious ectopic heartbeat mysterious
[2924.16 - 2927.92] heart palpitations
[2926.08 - 2930.08] right then we get other things that are
[2927.92 - 2931.28] mysterious we get anxiety with tightness

[2946.24 - 2951.12] had that tightness of the chest right
[2948.72 - 2953.52] so that's the vagus nerve
[2951.12 - 2955.36] being slightly inflamed creating that
[2953.52 - 2957.04] tightness of the chest it's the vagus
[2955.36 - 2958.16] nerve being slightly inflamed creating
[2957.04 - 2959.84] tightness at the chest i'm letting you
[2958.16 - 2961.52] guys know right there

[3040.96 - 3047.28] in many other people's lives
[3044.08 - 3050.16] i went to 13 doctors and no one tested
[3047.28 - 3052.40] me for ebv most doctors know nothing
[3050.16 - 3054.00] about chronic illness he's the only one
[3052.40 - 3056.72] who teaches the truth about chronic
[3054.00 - 3057.92] illness and it and its causes because he
[3056.72 - 3058.96] cares
[3057.92 - 3061.84] he makes
[3058.96 - 3064.00] zero money when we are sick
[3061.84 - 3066.48] but guess who does make money when we
[3064.00 - 3068.00] are sick think about it right i'm
[3066.48 - 3069.68] thinking about a lot of things podcasts
[3068.00 - 3070.88] doctors make a ton of money like you
[3069.68 - 3072.48] know there's all kinds of people that
[3070.88 - 3073.76] i'm just big pharma
[3072.48 - 3075.60] yvonne
[3073.76 - 3077.44] incredible on facebook
[3075.60 - 3079.04] yvonne master i'm andre you're uh
[3077.44 - 3080.24] honored you're here truly and it means
[3079.04 - 3083.04] the world
[3080.24 - 3085.36] and what happens is people go to 13
[3083.04 - 3087.76] doctors and you went to 13 doctors and
[3085.36 - 3089.84] it's brutal and i and it is and it's
[3087.76 - 3091.20] hard to it's it's
[3089.84 - 3094.24] i don't
[3091.20 - 3096.40] you have to be a special person
[3094.24 - 3098.96] yvonne right and you guys know this if
[3096.40 - 3100.64] you went to all those doctors
[3098.96 - 3102.40] you went through a lot
[3100.64 - 3104.56] you went through a lot
[3102.40 - 3106.96] and you can't measure that
[3104.56 - 3110.48] any you any of what you guys have gone
[3106.96 - 3112.72] through any of it it's not measurable it
[3110.48 - 3114.00] goes into the spiritual realm
[3112.72 - 3115.84] you guys have been through hell and back
[3114.00 - 3118.16] many of you it goes into the spiritual
[3115.84 - 3120.00] realm you guys are spiritual powers now
[3118.16 - 3125.04] because you because what it is is you
[3120.00 - 3126.16] can't measure that what you went through
[3125.04 - 3129.20] only
[3126.16 - 3131.52] from above that's who sees that okay god
[3129.20 - 3132.72] sees that the angels say that christ
[3131.52 - 3134.40] sees that
[3132.72 - 3135.76] the light sees that the creator sees it
[3134.40 - 3138.40] whatever anybody believes is what i'm
[3135.76 - 3140.24] saying sees that of what you went
[3138.40 - 3142.88] through
[3140.24 - 3145.12] can't be measured down here
[3142.88 - 3146.88] julie says i just got a new couch and
[3145.12 - 3148.32] because of all the chemicals sprayed on
[3146.88 - 3149.92] it that's rough
[3148.32 - 3151.60] i get this tightness in my chest and
[3149.92 - 3153.12] shortness of breath is this the same
[3151.60 - 3155.04] thing yes so what it is julie is what it
[3153.12 - 3157.20] means is you got the hypersensitivities
[3155.04 - 3160.64] right so what i tell a lot of people and
[3157.20 - 3162.48] and and a family member who a family
[3160.64 - 3164.56] member of mine came to me like back a
[3162.48 - 3166.40] few years ago and said look i need these
[3164.56 - 3168.88] medals out i'm ready and i'm like all
[3166.40 - 3172.24] right let's do it
[3168.88 - 3173.76] and what happened was right before that
[3172.24 - 3175.28] they had the metals in their system and
[3173.76 - 3177.44] it takes time to get the metals out and
[3175.28 - 3178.72] the metals are also in chemicals that
[3177.44 - 3181.04] are on like new couches and all that
[3178.72 - 3183.44] stuff and what happens is it triggers
[3181.04 - 3185.20] our vagus nerves so when we breathe in
[3183.44 - 3186.88] that chemical there's certain chemicals
[3185.20 - 3188.64] they spray on new furniture not all new
[3186.88 - 3190.40] furniture but a lot of furniture they
[3188.64 - 3192.40] spray these new chemicals on there and
[3190.40 - 3194.16] the new chemicals they
[3192.40 - 3195.36] they trick out our vagus nerves because
[3194.16 - 3196.72] their vagus nerves are already
[3195.36 - 3198.16] hypersensitive from everything we've
[3196.72 - 3199.52] been through including metals and all
[3198.16 - 3200.88] that
[3199.52 - 3203.20] it really is
[3200.88 - 3204.56] that's really what people go through so
[3203.20 - 3205.92] we're talking about metals we're talking
[3204.56 - 3207.20] about why to get them out we're talking
[3205.92 - 3209.28] about how we get them we're talking
[3207.20 - 3210.96] about the vagus nerves phrenic nerves is
[3209.28 - 3213.68] another one too vagus nerve is my
[3210.96 - 3215.36] problem patty says okay
[3213.68 - 3217.12] yeah yeah i mean
[3215.36 - 3219.20] and the thing is is phrenic nerves is
[3217.12 - 3220.64] another thing too okay phrenic nerves
[3219.20 - 3222.48] run through the chest they come off the
[3220.64 - 3224.16] spine area they run through the chest
[3222.48 - 3225.60] they run they run off the spine up here
[3224.16 - 3227.76] they run down
[3225.60 - 3230.24] phrenic nerves get inflamed olivia
[3227.76 - 3232.08] westman says what should we take for
[3230.24 - 3233.60] heart palpitation so we have the heart
[3232.08 - 3234.40] right here
[3233.60 - 3235.52] okay
[3234.40 - 3238.56] so
[3235.52 - 3240.80] heart palpitations that are mysterious
[3238.56 - 3243.12] that are derived from neurological
[3240.80 - 3245.44] they're mysterious they're derived from
[3243.12 - 3246.88] messages coming
[3245.44 - 3249.60] from
[3246.88 - 3250.96] the brain or brain stem
[3249.60 - 3253.44] right
[3250.96 - 3255.36] or vagus nerve so these are messages
[3253.44 - 3256.72] getting skewed along the way before they
[3255.36 - 3258.56] get to the heart and then when they get
[3256.72 - 3261.12] to the heart
[3258.56 - 3261.12] they do this
[3261.28 - 3263.36] right here
[3262.48 - 3265.44] see
[3263.36 - 3267.60] it's like morse code
[3265.44 - 3270.00] all of a sudden an electrical impulse is
[3267.60 - 3271.20] going to the heart in a different way
[3270.00 - 3272.48] and so now we're getting the hard part
[3271.20 - 3273.76] so here you are you're going along
[3272.48 - 3274.96] you're going along you're going along
[3273.76 - 3277.20] and then
[3274.96 - 3279.12] what the heck what
[3277.20 - 3281.60] what the heck was that
[3279.12 - 3283.28] oh my god what was that
[3281.60 - 3284.96] i gotta get to the hospital right now
[3283.28 - 3286.24] it's my first set of heart palpitations
[3284.96 - 3287.44] and every time someone gets the first
[3286.24 - 3289.44] set of heart palpitations they run to
[3287.44 - 3290.88] the emergency room and they get all the
[3289.44 - 3292.56] tests and everything's checked out well
[3290.88 - 3294.08] another one
[3292.56 - 3295.44] okay
[3294.08 - 3297.28] so i'm going to move
[3295.44 - 3299.36] my dummy over and we're going to run
