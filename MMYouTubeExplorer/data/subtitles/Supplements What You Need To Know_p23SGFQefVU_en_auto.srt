tonight we're talking about

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,040
supplements this is a really important

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,559
live and i want to cover a lot of

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,320
information as much as i can

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,320
there's a lot of information out there

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
about supplements first of all there's a

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
lot of people out there that think they

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,760
don't need any supplementation

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,439
they don't need anything they can get

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,960
everything from their food

13
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,960
okay so that's that's what a lot of

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
people believe they can just get it all

15
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,560
from their food

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,399
and you know and they're covered right

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,320
and then you got people that believe

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,320
they do need some supplements and that

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
it may be a sound thing to do and it may

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
be important to do

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,800

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160

but there's a lot of people that you

28
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
know like i said they believe they could

29
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,520
get it all from their food and

30
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,520
and can we get everything from our food

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
can we get every chemical compound can

32
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,199
we get every nutrient

33
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,079
can we get all the things we need from

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,239
just our

35
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
food that's really important all on its

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,000
own like that's an important critical

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,119
thing to like think about

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
if we can get everything

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
from our food think about this you guys

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,960
check this out okay if we can get

41
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,920
everything from our food

42
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,479
all right well then what about the food

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,439
we eat

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,200
all these years what about the food we

45
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,720
ate 20 years ago what about the food we

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
ate 10 years ago what about the food we

47
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,360
ate five years ago

48
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,960
what about the processed food we might

49
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,079
have eaten what about the gras

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
the greasy uh fast food we might have

51
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
eaten right

52
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
what about that all in its own think

53
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
about that so

54
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,399
you know there's a lot to really

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,960
consider here

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,040
and did we eat poor food in the mean

57
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
like very poorly in the past

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
so even if we're on the most amazing

59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
diet right now even if you think you're

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,399
on this great balanced diet or you're on

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,479
this

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,000
in a food combining diet someone sold

63
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,479
you into or you're on a

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,520
you're on a intuitive eating diet which

65
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,520
really you know

66
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,200
isn't really much of anything in many

67
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
ways and say you're on a paleo diet or

68
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,640
say you're on a plant-based diet or

69
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,360
whatever you're doing

70
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
what was the last 20 years was it all

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,560
organic

72
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
were you eating have you been eating

73
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
organic food since birth

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,840
and i'm going to tell you something

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
about even organic

76
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,640
farms organic soil i mean the farm

77
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,520
soil and organic farming is depleted

78
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
so even farms that are growing organic

79
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
food

80
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,879
you know are are depleted of many

81
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,080
trace minerals many nutrients and that's

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,760
organic

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,599
so if you if so say you're somebody who

84
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
didn't eat didn't eat organic your whole

85
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,480
life because how

86
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
come on like who who's eating organic

87
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,000
their whole life not a lot of people i'm

88
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,879
not a lot of people and was there soil

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,599
the most

90
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
richest and nutritious you know it's you

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,599
know like whatever

92
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
but i mean i've known people that they

93
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,800
grow their own food okay

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,959
and their soil is so rich

95
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
their compost that they use everything

96
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
they do

97
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,200
and trace minerals that they add through

98
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
all kinds of different options right

99
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,239
and they're using rock dust and they're

100
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,200
using all these different options and

101
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
it's soaked but

102
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,920
but organic farming it doesn't really do

103
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
that that's not how it's done

104
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,239
so and then conventional farming really

105
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
depleted conventional farming really

106
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,799
depleted so

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,879
here's the deal here's the question i

108
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,799
want to ask you you know and no big deal

109
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,360
it's just an interesting question

110
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,799
um were you eating a lot of wild foods

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
throughout your life if you're someone

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
that believes you can get every single

113
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,959
thing from your food and you don't need

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,000
supplements and you don't need

115
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
supplementation

116
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080

to get the nutrition we need and get all

165
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
the things we need how much fruit

166
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
think about that one right there on his

167
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
out and with the trace minerals the

168
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,759
antioxidants the antiviral compounds in

169
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
fruit the antibacterial compounds in

170
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
fruit

171
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
right the phytochemical compounds in

172
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,960
fruit that actually

173
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,000
de-age us in the berries and the apples

174
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,840
and cleanse our liver

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,520
and get in and feed our liver all kinds

176
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,600
of glucose and nutrients

177
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,720
how much fruit are we doing our whole 20

178
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
30 years

179
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,960
but wait a minute you probably had pizza

180
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
of course you had pizza

181
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,600
i'm sure right well those pizza days

182
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
means you weren't eating all wild foods

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
and even if you weren't doing pizza that

184
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
day you probably wouldn't be doing wild

185
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,960
foods i'm not

186
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,160
shaming anybody i'm not at all

187
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,080
this is life this is normal like

188
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,759
exactly you might be somebody that had

189
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,199

talk about

233
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,440
all of this and it's really interesting

234
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,160
information if you really think about it

235
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
because

236
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,199
i run into people all the time and

237
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,880
they're like i don't need

238
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,960
any b12 and i don't need anything

239
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,840
because i get everything from my food

240
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
it's not really possible even though i

241
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
want people to get as much as they can

242
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,720
get out of foods but

243
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
no one's going to keep up with the wild

244
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
foods no one's going to keep on it with

245
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,520
all that no one's going to do aloe vera

246
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
every single day no one's going to do

247
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,440
aloe every day

248
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,360
you know it's not going to happen so you

249
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,919
know and so supplementation is important

250
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
and then

251
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,039
if you're suffering with a symptom or a

252
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,639
condition like

253
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960

254
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
conditions plus more in here

255
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
and you're suffering and then

256
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
supplementation

257
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400

258
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,599

you can start with the foods you can

260
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
start with the cleanses and a lot of

261
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,319
people they just get rid of their

262
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,120

crank because that's the whole point

267
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
and go as far as you need to go powerful

268
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,080
information you won't hear anywhere else

269
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
i'm going to talk about tonight like all

270
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
medical medium information

271
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
if you did hear a word or two about

272
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,240
medical and medium information you're

273
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
like oh no wait a minute i heard about

274
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
metal

275
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,160
somewhere else focus you know consider

276
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,360
the details pay attention to the details

277
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,360
the details matter

278
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
because you'll know that that

279
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
information isn't

280
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
medical medium and you'll know that

281
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
medical medium information has all the

282
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,919
details like

283
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,120
how toxic heavy metals oxidize in our

284
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,720
brain and what

285
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,240
symptoms and conditions they cause that

286
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
never existed anywhere else so if you

287
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
hear something about it now it

288
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,320
originated from here

289
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,120
most people in the medical medium

290
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
community they started their journeys uh

291
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
seeing specialists

292
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
and doctors 10 doctors 15 doctors 20

293
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,360
doctors

294
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,959
i was known as the guy many years before

295
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,880
the books were published as a guy people

296
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,279
brought their bizarre symptoms to

297
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,880
and they couldn't get answers during the

298
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,680
course of sickness and they'd be seeing

299
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
all these different

300
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,120
doctors and everything and what happened

301
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
is that you know over the years of the

302
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,040
last 35 years i've worked with lots of

303
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
doctors that wanted answers wanted to

304
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
help troubleshooting cases

305
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
whole reason why this community grew so

306
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,240
big anyway throughout the years and

307
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,959
millions of medical medium books have

308
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,519
gone around the world and have sold

309
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,279
like that one right there the reason why

310
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,279
is because people got answers for the

311
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,640
first time and that was important so

312
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,160
people in the medical medium community

313
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,600
they've been there they've done that

314
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,120
a lot of people come here who haven't

315
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
been there and done that yet they get

316
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
here early and they start doing stuff

317
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,959
and

318
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,040
and they don't have that experience of

319
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,640
going around for you know five years

320
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,080
with symptoms and conditions and not

321
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
having answers they don't have that

322
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,959
experience yet

323
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
but most people they've been there

324
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,800
they've done that so it's been really

325
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
kind of a great thing to offer the

326
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,200
information so people can move forward

327
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
and real compassionate doctors lots of

328
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920

331
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,440

too

433
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,200
on another side of it you can be

434
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,160
somebody that's just doing the mono

435
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,079
eating cleanse

436
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,200
it's the 369 you could be doing the

437
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,079
morning clench you could do the heavy

438
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
metal detox

439
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
cleanse you could do the anti-bug

440
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,079
cleanse there's lots of cleanses in the

441
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,040
book you do 369 original simplified and

442
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,680
advanced

443
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,199
the book is really designed for someone

444
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,480
to customize

445
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,079
their entire system

446
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
and that's what's amazing there isn't

447
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,959
just medical medium protocol

448
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,880
and i tried it and it didn't work you

449
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,480
know what you'll find out there

450
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
someone would be like oh i tried medical

451
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,800
medium it didn't work um oh

452
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,399
that's interesting oh my god did you do

453
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,519
the 369 advance

454
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,360
three times in a row did you do um

455
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
the mono eating cleanse did you try that

456
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
for a month did you do the supplements

457
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,959
and dosages

458
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,560
did you do that always keep that in mind

459
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,160
you know because what happens is the

460
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,519
book is designed with thousands of

461
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,839
protocols so

462
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,959
if someone says i tried medical media it

463
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,600
didn't work i tried fruits and

464
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
vegetables

465
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
that's pretty funny because there's

466
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
thousands of customized protocols in

467
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,560
medical medium books

468
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,279
thousands so there's a reason for that

469
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
there's

470
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,639
over a thousand combinations in here so

471
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,519
you can actually

472
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,000
heal and move yourself forward there's a

473
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,320
reason for that you can do

474
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
three of the supplement recommendations

475
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
you can do

476
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,240
two of the cleanses you can customize it

477
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,920
you can get yourself to a place

478
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,519
and you can take it all the way that's

479
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,160
how the book's designed

480
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,440
so all these points are really important

481
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
so let's get moving here a little bit

482
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
i'm in chapter 27 what you need to know

483
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
about supplements right here

484
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
i get asked questions all the time just

485
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,320
hundreds and hundreds of questions

486
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,360
especially thousands of questions

487
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
i mean it's ongoing okay like uh

488
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,800
the questions come all different sizes

489
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,199
and shapes like

490
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,279
do i need supplements do i not how do i

491
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,360
go about it where do i start

492
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
i'm sensitive you know that's a question

493
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,639
too you'll get like

494
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
i'm sensitive what do i do how do i go

495
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,120
about this

496
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
so there's just there's there's so much

497
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,360
of that and i completely understand

498
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,880
the thing is is that if you actually

499
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,800
read

500
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,800
the book cleanse the heel first of all

501
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
if i notice with all the different

502
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,480
questions i get

503
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
about supplementation or about cleansing

504
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
or however

505
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,440
i realize that the person a doesn't have

506
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
the book or never got the book

507
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,959
and that happens so if you're if you're

508
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
one of those

509
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,519
you you can get it first it's on sale 51

510
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,959
off right now in amazon us i mean

511
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
you can't go wrong with that or get it

512
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,240
free at the library if you're

513
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,000
and i noticed that i'll get a question

514
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,920
like you know

515
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,519
um i don't you know like what do i do

516
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,320
for this what do i do for that condition

517
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,160
well

518
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
sounds like you didn't read this chapter

519
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,800
what you need to know about supplements

520
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,079
and then true cause of symptoms and

521
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
conditions so it's either someone

522
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,759
doesn't have the book or they never read

523
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,279
it

524
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,199
it's one or the other if they have it

525
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,519
they haven't read it yet so let's cover

526
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,360
this

527
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,800
so what i want to do is i want to walk

528
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,399
through some of the

529
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,639
pieces of it now i won't be able to

530
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,839
cover every single aspect the book has

531
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,519
too much information

532
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
it's never too much but tremendous

533
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,160
amounts of information

534
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,959
that walks you through so this this

535
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,240
is your guide and that's what it is it's

536
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
like me

537
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,160
i i put the book together with spirit of

538
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,360
compassion to make it like

539
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,560
you got me there with you as far as like

540
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,000
taking that to that place so

541
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,680
i'm starting on page 472 right here and

542
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
i'm just going to read a little bit some

543
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160

544
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160

all that

548
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,720
um so just the first line in here why is

549
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
the world of nutraceuticals exploding

550
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920

supplementation nutraceuticals exploding

553
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
that's because people are sick

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,160
they're sick no one wants to take

555
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
supplements who wants to take

556
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120

569
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,600
um jennifer said how do i

570
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,400
how do i heal hashimoto's jennifer to

571
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,080
begin with

572
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,559
that's a really good question it's going

573
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
to take us into here actually too

574
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,600
if you've been diagnosed with

575
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,559
hashimoto's thyroiditis

576
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,360
okay first thing is to learn the cause

577
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,840
learn the cause because the doctors

578
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,280
have to tell patients what science

579
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,799
research believes it is

580
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
which is your body attacking itself

581
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
which is your immune system tacking your

582
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
own thyroid

583
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
creates an autoantibody and attacks the

584
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,360
thyroid that's not accurate

585
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,799
because they've never proved it they've

586
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
never showed it there's no study that

587
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,000
can show it there's no

588
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,160
there's no peer review study that shows

589
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,160
it there's no technology developed yet

590
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,960
to show the body attacking its

591
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,679
its own gland so i talk about the true

592
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
cause

593
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,480
in cleanse to heal so the first thing is

594
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,520
you get the book you go to the library

595
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
and get the book for free okay and when

596
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,640
you have the book

597
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,200
go into the symptoms and conditions

598
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
section all right and find out what the

599
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,679
true cause

600
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
was of what is hashimoto's why you have

601
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,960
hashimoto's that's to begin with

602
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,720
then you'll see supplementation and

603
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
protocols there but i want you to read

604
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,960
the chapter and everything before you

605
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,760
even get there so i'm in chapter 27.

606
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,320
so the reason why nutrition

607
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,039
nutraceuticals are exploding you guys

608
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,440
is because people are sick literally

609
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,600
sick

610
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,720
that's the reason why really important

611
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,799
to know right there

612
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,640
um and so because no one wants to just

613
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
go and buy supplements purchase

614
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,520
supplements

615
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,039
spend all that money and that's one of

616
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
the problems and here's a question i get

617
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,160
all the time

618
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,000
how do i do this what i'm going to end

619
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,840
up spending all this money

620
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and out there because that's what people

621
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,039
do i've had people come to my office for

622
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,720
years for decades

623
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
i spent ten thousand dollars in

624
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
supplements just this month

625
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,240
i spent all these supplements i bought

626
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
out there in the world i went to this

627
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,880
doctor that practitioner this healer

628
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,720
and i got treasure troves of supplements

629
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
in in my cabinets and then i would be

630
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,200
like well

631
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,720
does any of those practitioners or

632
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,160
people know what the true cause of your

633
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
condition was they're like no

634
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,039
they don't know what's causing my

635
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,480
fibromyalgia they don't know what's

636
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
causing this and that because nobody

637
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
knows

638
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,039
right and so be like let's find out the

639
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
true cause to what your fibromyalgia is

640
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,640
i'm just giving that as one example

641
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
and then let's look at your treasure

642
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,799
trove of supplements that are in your

643
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
cabinet

644
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
and find out if any of them are for your

645
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
fibro and then when you go into their

646
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,440
cabinet i've seen this with so many

647
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
clients over the years years and years

648
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
ago they'd go

649
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,360
i'd go in their cabinet with them and

650
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
they would have

651
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,880
thousands of dollars of supplements that

652
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
were not going to help their

653
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
fibromyalgia

654
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,880
because the practitioners and the

655
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,559
doctors did not know what the cause of

656
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,039
the fibro was

657
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,480
and so that's why the person wasn't

658
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,039
getting better and that's why the person

659
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
spent

660
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,120
thousands of dollars the whole reason

661
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,280
for medical medium information is why

662
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,159
i explode like the medical media book

663
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
one exploded when it did in 2014 15

664
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,120
2015.

665
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
whole reason why we got here is because

666
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
there were answers for conditions and

667
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,480
then when you take a supplement

668
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,960
for the answer you move forward

669
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,640
and that's what happens with medical

670
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,320
media information that's why it's so

671
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,480
important so

672
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,080
um so let's go into here a little bit

673
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,080
more of all this

674
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
let's see

675
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,280
you know this is interesting here

676
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,320
supplementation while cleansing it's an

677
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,159
important question

678
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,679
like do i take supplements while

679
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,320
cleansing okay

680
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,520
do i take supplements while cleansing

681
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,679
it's an important question

682
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,720
how do we integrate supplements with the

683
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,559
cleanse

684
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,159
we'll get a few keys let me give you a

685
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
few key steps and reasons let's start

686
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,960
with that right there say you're

687
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
somebody doing the 369

688
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,520
and you want to still take your

689
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
supplements so say you still want to

690
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
take your lemon balm right here

691
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,880
so it's you know like that your lemon

692
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,559
balm or say you still want to take your

693
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,679
b12 or something like that i'm just

694
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,280
saying so i'm going to show you some

695
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,559
supplements in a little while too

696
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,919
um just know that when you're cleansing

697
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,960
you're lowering your fats

698
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
when you're when you're doing medical

699
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,919
medium cleanses okay because you're

700
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,320
bringing your fats down

701
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,200
when you bring your fats down your blood

702
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
your blood

703
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,960
doesn't have to deal with all that fat

704
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,600
that's in the bloodstream

705
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,039
and any supplement you ever take in your

706
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,640
life doesn't matter what it is or

707
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
whatever it is if there's anything good

708
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,280
in that supplement like a nutrient of

709
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,960
some kind

710
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,799
no matter what supplement it is whether

711
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,760
it's a vitamin or an herb or a nutrient

712
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
of some kind

713
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,679
anything you're taking can only do as

714
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,159
good

715
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,720
if it enters the cells so it actually

716
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,280
enters

717
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,039
our cells and so the reason one of the

718
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,559
reasons why in the cleanse is too i mean

719
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,720
the fats get lowered

720
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,640
is because when you lower the fats you

721
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,799
can get more nutrients into cells

722
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
as well so that means that you won't

723
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,960
have to do

724
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,559
higher dosages on supplementation

725
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
when you're doing cleanses because you

726
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,960
got the glucose in there

727
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,080
the glucose attaches itself the glucose

728
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,039
of your bloodstream

729
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
attaches itself to nutrients keep that

730
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,600
in mind

731
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
so the glucose you know in your

732
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,919
bloodstream okay

733
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,799
attaches to nutrients and drives it into

734
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,120
cells

735
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,240
always keep that in mind so when you're

736
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,240
doing a

737
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,000

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
there

748
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,720
and i have all the different supplement

749
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
companies i like i'm friends with so

750
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
many of the

751
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,440
the supplement companies that are good

752
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,400
because i like to know these people

753
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
to some degree so that they don't like

754
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,280
you know

755
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
put something terrible in something and

756
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
all of a sudden whatever but i don't own

757
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,039
any of the companies on there

758
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,000
the point is is that is that and i'm not

759
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,320
sponsored by them

760
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,080
but the point is with the supplements is

761
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,919
that you don't have well you could

762
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
cleanse and you can hold supplements off

763
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,559
if you want why cleansing there's

764
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
nothing wrong with that and if you want

765
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,919
to take your supplements

766
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,080
while cleansing they're going to be more

767
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,760
potent so you can bring the dosages down

768
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,679
too that's an important question i get

769
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
asked all the time and

770
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
the reason why you can bring your

771
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,240
dosages down because you're taking fats

772
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,679
out of your diet during those cleanses

773
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,559
and so that means all those nutrients go

774
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,039
right into cells much easier much faster

775
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,960
that's no one knows this information

776
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,799
this is medical medium information

777
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,559
this is why medical media books medical

778
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,400
medium cleanses and medical medium books

779
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,919
and protocols get people better than

780
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
most because when they take the right

781
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,640
supplements

782
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
for the right problem when they find out

783
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
what the cause is

784
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
and they actually also do the cleanse to

785
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,159
lower down the fats

786
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,760
what happens is all those powerful

787
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,360
nutrients go into cells

788
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,200
and they start coming out of their

789
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,640
diseases conditions and symptoms and

790
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,919
problems and all this other stuff

791
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,360
and if they go to their doctor and they

792
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,640
bring the information they get even

793
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
extra help and all they get all this

794
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,039
extra help so

795
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,880
it's important to note that's one thing

796
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
i want to cover right there so

797
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,080
i'm going to go into supplements to

798
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,320
avoid while cleansing so let's head in

799
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,360
there right now

800
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,200
so let's go into there and supplements

801
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,360
to avoid while cleansing

802
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,840
if you're on supplements that are not

803
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,520
medical medium recommended

804
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
that's when we can get in trouble so

805
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,360
let's talk about that a little bit

806
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,200
so i'm going to cleanse the heel right

807
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,120
here i'm reading excerpts out of here

808
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,559
we're talking about supplementation

809
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,320
if you just got on here i'm going to cut

810
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,320
open an aloe leaf and talk about how i

811
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,559
eat the aloe in a couple of minutes

812
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,919
we're going to cover that and we'll talk

813
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,840
about some different supplements and so

814
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,320
forth so reading out of cleanse to heal

815
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,919
so supplements to avoid while cleansing

816
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,520
you guys if you are on supplements that

817
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
are not medical medium recommended that

818
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,640
means medicalmedium.com

819
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,880
on my directory you know for instance

820
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
like you're on whey protein powder

821
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,720
then you can be held back with your

822
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
healing really important to know

823
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
probably one of the most important

824
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
questions out there because you'll see

825
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,440
out there like what about collagen

826
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
what about whey protein powder what

827
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
about something else

828
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
and what about nutritional yeast because

829
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,279
people use that as a supplementation

830
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,640
nutritional yeast will hold somebody

831
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,520
back from healing when they're really

832
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
sick

833
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,279
um because you know because of msg and

834
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,279
so when

835
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,559
when we run into this stuff this is

836
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,159
where it gets kind of dicey

837
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,320
because a lot of people are on

838
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
supplementation that feeds

839
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
pathogens without them knowing it whey

840
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,240
protein powder will feed

841
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,520
an epstein bar a shingles virus a herpes

842
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
simplex one

843
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
cold sores okay people think cold sores

844
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
are no big deal they just they're on

845
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,679
their lip for a minute and then they go

846
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,640
away and that's it no they they're

847
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,000
actually

848
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,679
actually a lot of neurotoxins are

849
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,120
produced by them it gives people a lot

850
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,919
of issues you can even get trigeminal

851
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
neuralgia

852
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,200
like peeking up a little even though

853
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,159
shingles is the number one thing for

854
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,679
trigeminal neuralgia but um and if

855
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,400
you've heard nutritional yeast isn't

856
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,400
good for you it originated here

857
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,159
no one thought nutritional yeast was bad

858
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,840
for you no one thought that was bad for

859
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,360
the msg the glutamic

860
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
acid that's naturally occurring in it

861
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,080
it's not even just that's just one

862
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,760
reason why it's not good there's a bunch

863
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,559
of reasons medical medium information

864
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
only

865
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
but um but this is how it works you guys

866
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,600
i just want to cover this

867
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,159
one second if medical medium information

868
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
says

869
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,159
nutritional yeast is bad and it's the

870
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,400
first place that says it right

871
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,200
it gets out there and it gets all around

872
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,039
and then

873
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,640
someone hears it out there and they'll

874
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,400
be like oh well wait a minute

875
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,240
i heard it out there so no anthony

876
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,080
doesn't know anything when it originated

877
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,480
here it's unbelievable

878
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,320
this is how it works it's not ego it's

879
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,679
just or anything like that

880
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,440
what it is is okay well don't you want

881
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,120
to know where all the information is so

882
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,039
someone can heal it's about getting

883
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
people help so they have a way back to

884
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
all of it

885
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,240
oh heavy metals are bad in our system um

886
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
but why are they bad in your system

887
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,400
you'll find all the information here

888
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,159
of why it's bad information no one's

889
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,799
ever heard before and how it

890
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,880
oxidizes in your brain and spreads into

891
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,520
brain tissue nobody knew that ever

892
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,159
nobody not one place so i say this stuff

893
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,000
because

894
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,600
if you hear about toxic heavy metals out

895
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
there somewhere and

896
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,640
know where all the information is so you

897
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,480
can actually get them out of your system

898
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,600
which leads to the next thing

899
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,440
corella so here so corella's a terrible

900
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,279
supplement for people to take but still

901
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,399
even now you'll see like influencers on

902
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,320
social media like

903
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,960
taking my corella right now it's like oh

904
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,279
my god it's just how does this keep on

905
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,799
happening how do we get here where it

906
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,600
keeps on happening it's

907
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,880
so painful and so it's it's really tough

908
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
because

909
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,240
corella is toxic bottom line it's just

910
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
toxic

911
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
i'm just going to say it outright first

912
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,279
of all most of them end up with bacteria

913
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
in them

914
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
i've seen people doubled over vomiting

915
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
for days and days and days because of

916
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,960
corella

917
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,640
you can hit anybody at any time that's

918
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,559
one thing corella also doesn't remove

919
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,000
toxic heavy metals corella has toxic

920
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,600
heavy metals in it

921
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,120
like it goes on and on and on and on so

922
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
all these things are important to know

923
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,240
so if you're someone and you're like

924
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
doing fish oil it's another one you

925
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,919
can't get the mercury out of fish oil

926
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,360
you cannot get the mercury out of fish

927
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,919
oil i'm sorry you can't

928
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,760
you can do a centrifuge chelation you

929
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,080
can do anything you want

930
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,640
on fish oil your guys you're not going

931
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,240
to get the toxic heavy metal residue out

932
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
the methyl mercury because the more you

933
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,559
take it out

934
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,039
of an oil fish oil the more more

935
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,200
dangerous it gets because homeopathic

936
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,679
and a homeopathic reaction occurs

937
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,679
where you keep on diluting and diluting

938
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,520
you keep on trying to get that mercury

939
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,200
out and then that fish oil becomes more

940
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,039
toxic and then the methyl mercury it

941
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,360
goes to the brain it's it's it's

942
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
less it's less toxic to eat a can of

943
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,399
tuna fish

944
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,320
than do fish oil supplements and we know

945
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,440
how bad a can of tuna fish is

946
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,640
so i mean there we go so fish oil is

947
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
another example

948
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,679
it's like i'm not getting better on a

949
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,840
medical mean protocol but i'm on whey

950
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,000
protein powder collagen fish oil

951
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,559
uh corella um protein powders

952
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,399
with msg in them glandular supplements

953
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
bovine supplements whatever i mean it's

954
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,919
it's it's the list goes on

955
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,919
it's like and that person's not doing

956
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,200
medical medium protocols it's just crazy

957
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,120
how it works so

958
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,240
um so the bottom line is one thing that

959
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,960
can hold people back

960
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,880
is supplementation not medical medium

961
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,960
recommended and there's a reason for it

962
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,480
i don't just pull this stuff

963
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,679
out of my hat okay or whatever

964
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,679
all right and it's like you know

965
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,960
there's a reason why these things don't

966
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,399
help people

967
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,399
and it's it's critical reasons so just

968
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,880
know this anyway if you just got on here

969
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:49,200
cleanse the heel 16.99 51 off amazon.com

970
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,880

971
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,840
and it went up to 20

972
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,320
and then it went back down to 16 as of

973
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,240
today it's like a miracle so

974
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,559

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,399
i don't have any control over the sale

977
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,520
of the book on any level amazon does all

978
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,640
that

979
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,360
that's just how it's done so let's go

980
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
into

981
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,640
let's go into some examples here i

982
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
talked about whey protein powder it'll

983
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,080
feed

984
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,760
pathogens it will feed pathogens i

985
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,440
talked about l-carnitine

986
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,880
also in the other medical medium books

987
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
that will feed

988
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,559
pathogens you can't get better while on

989
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
l-carnitine

990
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,399
you can't get better when you have a

991
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,399
real sickness a real issue

992
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,440
symptoms and conditions with whey

993
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,960
protein powder

994
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,880
you can't get better with these things

995
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,880
they feed bugs you can't get better with

996
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
natural flavorings and everything and

997
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,960
msg and everything you guys

998
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,399
this is critical and so like before i go

999
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,840
anywhere with supplements you got to

1000
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,919
know this baseline

1001
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,960
so important traces of mercury and fish

1002
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,679
oil

1003
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,440
mercury will feed pathogens that's why

1004
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,240
people have the fibromyalgia the lyme

1005
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,799
disease

1006
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,600
the rheumatoid arthritis the hashimoto's

1007
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,559
thyroiditis

1008
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,519
psoriatic arthritis the sarcoidosis just

1009
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,799
the list goes on

1010
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,080
you know the vitiligo whatever i mean

1011
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,799
all these different conditions

1012
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,840
mercury will feed you know eczema

1013
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,840
psoriasis

1014
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,399
mercury will feed bugs keep bugs alive

1015
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
not a good thing so fish oil is another

1016
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
bomb right there

1017
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,559
all on its own so i'm just covering a

1018
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,320
few other things here too so

1019
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,480
um it's a common mistake and prime

1020
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,240
example of why it's best to hold off on

1021
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,840
some supplements while you're doing

1022
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,080
a medical medium recommended um

1023
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,519
you know cleanse so if you're doing 369

1024
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,799
if you're doing mono eating cleanse if

1025
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,200
you're doing the morning cleanse if

1026
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,519
you're doing

1027
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,440
these powerful cleanses that are saving

1028
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,960
lives every day out there

1029
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
it's important to kind of hold off

1030
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,679
supplements you're doing because chances

1031
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,080
are

1032
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
before you got the book and before you

1033
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,519
started the cleanse

1034
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,880
you got i'm just using some of these as

1035
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,480
examples you got the corelli got the

1036
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640

you know you got the whatever and and

1038
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
everything i was talking about there the

1039
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,360
collagen the whey protein powder the

1040
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,000
other protein powders have msg in it

1041
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
that nobody knows

1042
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
about you're going to be on something

1043
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,640
and then you're going to go into the

1044
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,919
cleanse and you're going to be on these

1045
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,960
supplements that

i would go in cfs right there

1116
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,879
okay i would go in there and you'll see

1117
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,480
all the different supplements and you'll

1118
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,119
see all the different dosages in here

1119
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
okay

1120
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,560
so you'll see that and you start there

1121
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,320
um to begin with so that's the first

1122
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,040
important critical piece all right

1123
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,480
so once you've found your symptom or

1124
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,399
condition

1125
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,520
here in the book if you're sensitive

1126
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
you can try one supplement a day if

1127
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,320
you're

1128
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,280
sensitive you can try one supplement a

1129
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,359
day you guys

1130
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,760
if not you can put them all together

1131
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,280
as your daily like regimen so you can

1132
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,160
put them all together as your daily

1133
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
regimen

1134
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,000
or as a middle ground you can choose a

1135
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,040
couple to start off with and then take

1136
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,640
it from there

1137
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,880
so that's the way to go you can easily

1138
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,160
do that you can start with celery juice

1139
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
that's one thing you can start with

1140
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,040
celery juice that's an herb that's

1141
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,480
herbal medicine

1142
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,400
it's herbal medicine and so celery juice

1143
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,680
is an herbal medicine you can start with

1144
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,160
that herbal medicine

1145
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,280
you guys just so you know that that's

1146
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,000
what you can do

1147
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,680
and that's a big deal and starting there

1148
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
is just to start all on its own

1149
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,680
if you're somebody sensitive work your

1150
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
way up work your way up to 32 ounces of

1151
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,880
it

1152
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,520
that's what you can do and then well

1153
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,839
okay

1154
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,000
well another place you can go is b12

1155
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,839
that's another place you go so

1156
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,839
i'm gonna talk about like they're gonna

1157
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,440
so anyone who goes in there

1158
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,440
you're gonna see in here you're gonna

1159
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,720
see a baseline you'll see b12

1160
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,359
zinc vitamin c lemon balm okay

1161
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,480
you'll see those four and you'll see a

1162
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,240
list of most

1163
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
important for somebody to start with

1164
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,160
because you might be like well where do

1165
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,000
i start

1166
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,000
what's the most important supplement how

1167
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,440
do i do this well let's go to anxiety

1168
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,280
and anxiousness so i'm gonna head there

1169
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,920
now so i'm in anxiety and anxiousness

1170
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,839
right here

1171
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,839
okay so

1172
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,160
anxiety and anxiousness and you'll see

1173
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,720
all the different supplements and

1174
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,400
everything

1175
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,440
and i marked on anxiety right here i

1176
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,000
marked with a pen the number one

1177
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,599
thing you can try for this which is b12

1178
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
so if you have anxiety

1179
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,320
you can try b12 as number one you know

1180
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,920
my favorite b12 is the vimergy so it's

1181
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,560
the vimergy v is in victor i

1182
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,079
am as the mary ergy that's the vimerg

1183
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,359
b12 it's adenosine cobalamin

1184
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,119
methylcobalamin right

1185
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,800
but it's the best and highest quality on

1186
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,240
every level um

1187
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,040
and that makes a difference because

1188
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,880
crappy b12s don't really help i mean you

1189
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
can try your best to try to get the best

1190
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,599
that you can

1191
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,359
and you might get help a little bit but

1192
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,200
you know it's not easy out there i get

1193
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,160
it but that's the one i would use that's

1194
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,320
my favorite

1195
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,079
so b12 and if b12 is showing high in

1196
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,599
blood tests okay

1197
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,160
doesn't mean you're getting enough b12

1198
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,440
because b12 high in your blood means

1199
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,680
that there's a methylation

1200
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,440
issue so that means there's no reason to

1201
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,320
stop taking b12 if you have it high in a

1202
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,880
blood test

1203
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,119
because methylation issues are are

1204
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
what's happening when b12 does not

1205
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,800
when the liver is stagnant and sluggish

1206
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,480
and you have methylation lip

1207
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,640
issues in the liver which most people

1208
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,320
have then what will show up

1209
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,160
is the b12 will float around in the

1210
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,000
bloodstream and not enter into the

1211
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,200
nervous system not enter into deep

1212
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,640
places so when

1213
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,720
when you get a blood test and it's

1214
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,240
showing high on b12

1215
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,119
it doesn't mean your nervous system is

1216
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,359
high in b12 it doesn't mean your brain

1217
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,359
is high in b12 it's just showing up in

1218
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,960
bloodstream as high in b12

1219
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,720
doesn't mean the methylation is working

1220
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
properly to get it deep into the nervous

1221
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,760
system

1222
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
which takes time so what people do is

1223
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,119
they'll make mistakes they'll stop b12

1224
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
altogether because a test would say

1225
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,000
it's high in b12 but they'll stop all

1226
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,359
together or they were using the wrong

1227
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,119
kind of b12

1228
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,720
and that's another thing all on its own

1229
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,079
so then they get cheated out of actually

1230
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,160
healing anxiety

1231
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,240
cheated out of healing um all kinds of

1232
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,480
different neurological symptoms

1233
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,440
ticks and spasms and aches and pains and

1234
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,160
because you know

1235
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,920
b12 is that critical for that so you got

1236
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,200
to be cautious on that when it shows up

1237
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,400
high the other thing is

1238
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,000
science research doesn't know what kind

1239
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
of b12 levels we're supposed to have

1240
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,520
with all the pathogens

1241
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,359
all the bugs all the toxins all the

1242
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,040
stress we're under

1243
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,880
science research doesn't govern all that

1244
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,000
or factor all that in they don't factor

1245
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,079
any of that in of what

1246
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,040
level of b12 is whatever the right kind

1247
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,160
of b12 or not

1248
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,200
it's so many so many potholes it's

1249
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,720
unbelievable

1250
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,160
to the degree of potholes all

1251
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,680
information that comes from medical

1252
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,000
media and

1253
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,599
all originates here i mean it just does

1254
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,760
all this type of information

1255
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,200
no one had any of this they don't it's

1256
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,400
just it's just i have to say that

1257
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,480
because

1258
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,400
it's critical to to know where it comes

1259
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,240
from so people can find their way

1260
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,240
and if it didn't come from here i

1261
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,520
wouldn't be saying it that's this

1262
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,320
it is what it is um

1263
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,720
so let's go into this a little bit so

1264
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,720
okay

1265
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,839
so where to start you have anxiety so

1266
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,560
let's head in there

1267
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,200
if someone has anxiety or anxiousness

1268
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,800
okay

1269
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
the best place to start when you look in

1270
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,320
supplements supplements right here i got

1271
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,440
i marked them

1272
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,480
you'll see number one is b12 number two

1273
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,800
is zinc

1274
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,839
so let's see the zinc that i use as

1275
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,320
example

1276
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,320
um so i'm on page

1277
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,200
491 for a second but we're really we're

1278
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,280
i'm only showing this as an example on

1279
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,680
page 491 where anxiety

1280
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,640
and i'm just showing you that there's

1281
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,200
there's there's

1282
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,079
um but really 476 is where i am though

1283
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,720
so i'm just gonna

1284
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,680
show you guys if you go in page 476 and

1285
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,839
cleanse the heel

1286
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,359
it says where to start right here i got

1287
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,960
all my little postage notes

1288
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,720
i i got a new book and i'm because that

1289
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,000
potions notes were on on the other book

1290
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
they filled up the whole thing so i'm

1291
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,040
just putting

1292
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,280
i'm starting fresh so in here

1293
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,280
it says celery juice is a good place to

1294
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,319
start beyond that vitamin b12 i showed

1295
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,560
you that guys

1296
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:12,720
zinc is the next one to start right here

1297
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,680
that's the vimergy zinc the one i love

1298
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,800
it's the right kind of zinc it's a

1299
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,839
liquid zinc sulfate but it's done right

1300
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
which cry which is critical um

1301
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,680
vitamin c is the third thing lemon bob's

1302
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,640
the fourth thing so what i do is i'll

1303
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,200
say hey

1304
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,960
if i got an anxiety disorder and i can't

1305
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,319
get rid of my anxiety and it's and i'm

1306
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,280
struggling with it and i'm suffering

1307
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,839
from it

1308
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,520
um first thing i would do is start a

1309
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,280
cleanse start when the cleanses and

1310
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,720
medical medium cleanse the heal second

1311
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,079
thing i would go i would read the

1312
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,599
supplements chapter and i would go and

1313
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
find anxiety in here this is what i

1314
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,000
would do

1315
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,960
and i would look and i would say well

1316
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,640
since i read the chapter it said

1317
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
start with just a few supplements if i

1318
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,440
want i don't have to do the whole

1319
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,680
protocol of everything

1320
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,680
i can just start with a few supplements

1321
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,720
and b12 is one of them

1322
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,240
it says three dropper fulls twice

1323
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,960
a day so for anxiety it says three

1324
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,240
dropper fulls twice a day of b12 and you

1325
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,000
go to your doctor

1326
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
you go to your practitioner and you can

1327
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,839
talk to them about that and that's what

1328
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,520
you can do

1329
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,160
so it's three dropper fulls twice a day

1330
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,000
that's one dropper full right there

1331
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,440
as an example and

1332
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,560
if you're sensitive though i'm going to

1333
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,280
read about that in a little bit if

1334
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,760
you're sensitive

1335
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,760
you can just do a few drops if you want

1336
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,800
i mean you can just literally start with

1337
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,760
a few drops one two three that's what

1338
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,760
you can do

1339
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,960
i mean if i was sensitive that's what i

1340
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,440
would do and you can do just a few drops

1341
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,079
um so the second thing i would go with

1342
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,640
would be

1343
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,160
zinc so that's the second thing right

1344
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,880
there and i would do the same thing it

1345
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,000
says

1346
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,319
zinc one dropper full daily of zinc so

1347
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,240
one dropper full daily of zinc

1348
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,079
and everybody's zinc deficient we have

1349
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,920
to understand that the soils are

1350
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,160
zinc deficient our food is zinc

1351
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,040
deficient organic food

1352
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,000
organic produce and organic food is zinc

1353
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,160
deficient

1354
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
so that's just how it works and so what

1355
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,359
happens is zinc

1356
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,040
controls our immune system that's what

1357
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,560
gives our immune system the power

1358
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,720
to battle everything that's why zinc is

1359
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,119
critical for what's going around now

1360
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,160
but zinc is critical for all the viral

1361
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,240
stuff all

1362
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,400
of it the epstein bars the shingles

1363
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,119
hhv-6s nobody talks about all these

1364
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,520
things

1365
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:25,280
critical for all of that so zinc is the

1366
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,640
next one right you'll see that and this

1367
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,680
is the vimergy zinc

1368
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,599
v is in victor i am ergy it's it's a

1369
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,359
liquid zinc sulfate but it's the right

1370
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,480
way to do it in the right kind like i

1371
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,240
said before

1372
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,200
so we'll go into the third thing vitamin

1373
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,040
c so that's the microc that i use right

1374
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,880
here it's the vimergy microc

1375
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,160
if you have a vitamin c you like it love

1376
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,560
it and

1377
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,200
and by all means try it and do that but

1378
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,240
for

1379
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,920
for anxiety you don't want one that

1380
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,280
is that straight ascorbic acid no buffer

1381
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,839
whatsoever because

1382
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,520
that's going to be irritating with

1383
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,240
anxiety if anything so

1384
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,000
that's why it says micro c really

1385
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,040
important on here it's the type of

1386
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,240
buffered kind

1387
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,520
so then we got the fourth is lemon balm

1388
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,680
so i'm going to go into that for a

1389
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,160
minute too you got the lemon balm

1390
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,839
lemon balm is critical for anxiety it's

1391
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,119
a great one right there i mean

1392
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,760
and it'll stay for anxiety four dropper

1393
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,359
fulls

1394
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,480
four times a day now if you got really

1395
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,480
mild anxiety

1396
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,000
you can do a half a dropper full you can

1397
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,040
do one dropper full

1398
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,520
you can do two for a whole day you can

1399
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,119
do

1400
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,920
three tiny drops you can do lemon balm

1401
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,480
tea

1402
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,319
this is traditional medicinals it's my

1403
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,480
favorite tea company so

1404
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,440
they got that's a lemon balm that i

1405
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,240
actually you know

1406
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,839
i have lemon balm tea every single day i

1407
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,359
like it because it's anti-viral

1408
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,480
anti-bacterial i like to keep my immune

1409
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,160
system strong

1410
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,079
you know just in case you bump into

1411
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,280
something or you're somewhere public

1412
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,400
and you know pick up something so i love

1413
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,480
the lemon bumps so

1414
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
but if you're that's the whole great

1415
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,599
thing is you look and you're like well

1416
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,119
lemon balm

1417
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,800
and they'll say four dropper holes twice

1418
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,880
a day okay so that's

1419
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,720
you know that's the lemon balm here but

1420
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,560
you can do smaller dosages

1421
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,000
if you if you're chemical sensitive if

1422
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,920
you've got food sensitivities if you're

1423
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,079
a really sensitive person

1424
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,440
you've got so many options here you can

1425
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,560
do one

1426
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,760
supplement one day then the next day

1427
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,440
do another one then the next day do

1428
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,040
another one

1429
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,560
and keep it just one at a time

1430
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,160
or three tiny drops of one three tiny

1431
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,480
drops of another and

1432
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,319
you can do so much that's why there's

1433
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,640

work with

1467
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,160
if you're getting overwhelmed at the

1468
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,839
amount of supplements in a list the

1469
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,560
reason why there's more supplementation

1470
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,000
in the list

1471
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,160
some people have more difficult

1472
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,119
pathogens they'll have a really stubborn

1473
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,480
epstein bar

1474
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,160
they'll have one of the over 60

you can do this on an eight day cycle

1546
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,640

1548
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,040
that

1549
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,720
so you can kind of like really digest

1550
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,839
that because i'm i'm going to cover so

1551
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,359
much ground here that

1552
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,079
i can only spend so much time with each

1553
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:32,559
powerful point um

1554
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,079
so and okay here's a question i always

1555
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,599
get all the time you guys can you

1556
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,680
put supplements in a smoothie yes

1557
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,359
but you don't have to here's what i like

1558
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,520
to do okay

1559
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,119
i like to do this first of all um with

1560
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,839
vimergy supplements

1561
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,960
because that's what i take myself

1562
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,000
personally i i don't put it in my

1563
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,680
smoothie i don't put

1564
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
supplements really in my smoothie like

1565
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,359
all like little tinctures all the herbs

1566
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,079
and all that i don't normally do that

1567
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,920
all right

1568
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,000
so what i like to do is um

1569
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,760
i like to get a little shot glass a

1570
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,240
small little glass put an ounce of water

1571
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,680
in it

1572
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,760
that's what i like to do personally and

1573
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,920
i put all my tinctures in there

1574
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,119
and then i just send it down and i chase

1575
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,000
it down with a little water if you don't

1576
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,359
like the taste

1577
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,559
that's what i like to do okay so um but

1578
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,480
people like to put it all in their

1579
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,760
smoothie but i don't like to put all the

1580
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,760
different tinctures and all

1581
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,680
all the subs in the smoothie because i

1582
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,599
want my smoothie to taste more like food

1583
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,920
and not herbal supplements

1584
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,359
um so that that's what i personally

1585
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,960
choose so you gotta dip you know a

1586
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,319
couple different options and all that to

1587
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,520
what you want to do

1588
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,200
um and

1589
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:41,119
so so that's just

1590
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,559
this is a quick answer for that that

1591
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,040
question and

1592
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,480
but but also i i also take them straight

1593
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,160
so i take all the liquid straight so

1594
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,720
that's what i do too a lot of times like

1595
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,720
i'll be

1596
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,720
a little bit too lazy i'm i got too much

1597
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,160
going on or i got so much on my plate

1598
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,839
i'll just instead of getting a shot

1599
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,400
glass and putting an ounce of water in

1600
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,880
it

1601
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,800
or small glass you know because you know

1602
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,720
whatever and put put water in it

1603
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,800
i just would do them straight to boom

1604
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,160
boom boom take them straight then drink

1605
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,559
right off you know glass of water

1606
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,200
whatever send it on down too

1607
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,559
so um that's what i that's what you can

1608
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,200
do

1609
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,240
when you see the term daily this is

1610
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,240
interesting

1611
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,000
that means to take the given dosage of

1612
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,520
the supplements over the course of the

1613
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,040
day you can take it

1614
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:28,319
over the course of the day okay um

1615
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,240
and and it's your choice on how you want

1616
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,359
to do that so when you say when you see

1617
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,880
daily you can

1618
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,960
it means that to take the given dosages

1619
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,520
of the supplement over the course of the

1620
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,359
day

1621
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,520
it's your choice on how to do that

1622
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,880
you're welcome to take the whole dose

1623
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,559
once a day when you see that whole

1624
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,200
section back here and cleanse the heel

1625
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,040
all right

1626
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,960
if you're sensitive you may want to

1627
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,400
break it up into multiple servings for

1628
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,319
example if it says to take

1629
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,440
two teaspoons of barley grass juice

1630
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,440
powder daily

1631
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,520
you may decide either to put both

1632
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,119
teaspoons together in a smoothie

1633
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,960
those work good in a smoothie by the way

1634
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,760
because the heavy metal detox movie has

1635
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,920
the

1636
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,839
the uh barley grass juice powder that's

1637
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,599
the bimrgy it has the spirulina

1638
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,119
the incredible spirulina it's the best

1639
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,319
carolina there's

1640
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,760
the emergencies barely is best in the

1641
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,160
world i put the wild blueberry powder in

1642
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,440
there

1643
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,960
you guys have seen that i did that the

1644
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,640
other day that medical medium heavy

1645
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,559
metal detox smoothie

1646
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,880
and it'll say for example it takes two

1647
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,400
you know it says two teaspoons of barley

1648
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,079
grass juice powder daily

1649
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,000
you may decide either to put both

1650
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,839
teaspoons together in a smoothie

1651
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,599

at night if you really wanted to i mean

1654
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,319
you can do it in so many different ways

1655
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,720
when you see the term twice a day that

1656
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,359

apart

1661
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,960
if you miss one of those installments on

1665
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,440

first of all actually singles for a

1671
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,599

1673
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,800

of the sale

um acne when you're in here

1708
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,680
what you'll notice is that most of the

1709
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,280
supplements recommended

1710
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,160
are in single form individual single

1711
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,040
form

1712
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,319
and some of them might have a few things

1713
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,400
in there

1714
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:42,440
but most of them are in single form

1715
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,079
you'll see spirulina

1716
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:49,920
asparalina and that's how you

1717
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,599
actually get better when you take a

1718
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,880
powder form out there

1719
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,559
that has 50 ingredients in there

1720
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,599
30 ingredients in there 25 ingredients

1721
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,240
in there

1722
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,599
chances of getting better are slim to

1723
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,359
none

1724
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,599
because what happens is supplement

1725
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:10,640
companies use a speck

1726
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,839
of spirulina and a crappy one and they

1727
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
throw it in there so you'll see

1728
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:16,480
spirulina on the list

1729
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,839
whoa alfalfa grass barley grass

1730
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,599
spirulina

1731
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,040
gorilla i mean what you mean you just

1732
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,520
see whatever going down the list

1733
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,960
collagen uh minerals trace minerals

1734
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,400
amino acids um

1735
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,280
and you're reading a whole list of these

1736
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,240
things you can't get better on those

1737
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,079
you can't that's what goes wrong so some

1738
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,480
people like oh i did the medical medium

1739
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:39,760
protocol i just i had lysine

1740
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:43,280
they had a speck of lysine in a

1741
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,920
amino acid formula that had 20 amino

1742
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,920
acids

1743
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,680
it's like throwing away money and not

1744
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,760
getting better

1745
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,200
and so you'll see that when you look in

1746
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,480
here at lysine

1747
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,640
i don't even know if i have a lysine

1748
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,839
right here i do i have a vimergy lysine

1749
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,480
right in front of me here

1750
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,760
when you see lysine you're getting

1751
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,440
enough lysine

1752
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,359
and then you know why you're using

1753
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,200
lysine because you're killing off

1754
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,119
epstein-barr you're knocking back

1755
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,480
epstein barr and when you knock down

1756
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,079
epstein bar and shingles

1757
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,599
often your tingles and numbness start to

1758
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,040
get a little better off stir aches and

1759
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,640
pains and your fatigue starts getting

1760
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,040
better over time

1761
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,760
and what happens is that supplement

1762
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,920
companies

1763
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,920
put 30 things in something 20 things in

1764
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,200
something 15 things in something 10 or

1765
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,359
more

1766
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,880
and when you have 10 or more in all

1767
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:29,920
these different supplements

1768
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:34,240
they got fillers in the supplement then

1769
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:37,359
you have a speck of dust of each thing

1770
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,160
it's how they take advantage rip off and

1771
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,319

1784
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,359
just sending you down the river without

a paddle

1786
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,359
and that's what they're doing so you

1787
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,400
guys the reason why

1788
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:14,400
it's singles in here it's advanced

1789
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,880
information it's above the rest

1790
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,680
a you know what's wrong b you know what

1791
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,240
to take

1792
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,839
c when you take natalie for a condition

1793
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,640
because i'm looking at metal leaf right

1794
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,200
here

1795
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,400
um and what i'm looking at right now i'm

1796
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,880
looking at nettle leaf

1797
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,599
when you take nettle you're not taking a

1798
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,319
speck of

1799
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,280
nettle dust in something that has 20

1800
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,240
ingredients

1801
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,040
in a supplement form or 10 to 15 18

1802
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,640
ingredients

1803
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,720
and you're taking you see nettle in

1804
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,000
there you're not getting nettle

1805
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,720
you're not going to get better from

1806
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,160
nettle and it's a scam because

1807
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,760
what they do is they get these

1808
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,839
fulfillment centers and

1809
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,440
all the companies they'll have a great

1810
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,720
cool you know

1811
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,280
a great cool earthy um label on the

1812
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,359
bottle

1813
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,119
you'll see an influencer some guy

1814
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,280
influencer like yeah this is so

1815
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,280
synergistic works with your body

1816
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,480
of the highest ingredient source from

1817
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,160
the amazon

1818
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,599
they'll have all that but really it's

1819
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,640
from a fulfillment center

1820
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:12,319
that guy's just a bull crapper and you

1821
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,160
have 15 different things in there plus

1822
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,000
citric acid which is terrible

1823
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,280
and all this other stuff this is

1824
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,359
critical to healing

1825
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,799
this is what matters this is how

1826
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,599
everything like really

1827
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,559
really this is how it happens here so

1828
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,119
this is really important to know and

1829
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,640
so you'll see singles in here by the way

1830
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,160
if you just got on here cleanse the heel

1831
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,599
take advantage of that so

1832
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,440
you know there's so much to cover here

1833
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:36,520
but take advantage of cleanse the heel

1834
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,040
of being like

1835
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,319
16.99 amazon but library go to the

1836
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,119
library if you want

1837
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,559
and because i can't cover it all here

1838
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,160
the reason why i keep on showing the

1839
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:48,559
book is what am i going to do

1840
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:50,319
um you guys not have the book and then

1841
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,040
not have all the information

1842
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,640
i can only show so much each live i'm

1843
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,640
trying to do as many as i can and do

1844
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,599
three lives a week or six lives a week

1845
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,680
really

1846
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,760
um to get guilty library and get it for

1847
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,599
free but it's critical to have the

1848
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,079
information in the book i mean what am i

1849
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,520
going to say

1850
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,559
so the whole thing here with singles

1851
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:14,400
for a reason is so critical

1852
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:18,000
when you take the lemon balm by itself

1853
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,720
or you drink the lemon balm tea

1854
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,720
by itself in a potent form like

1855
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,760
traditional medicinals

1856
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:29,040
i do both personally i do both and

1857
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,920
um when you do that it's not an herbal

1858
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,400
mix

1859
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,760
with a speck of dust and then and

1860
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,200
literally you get ripped off

1861
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,119
you look at your supplement that's what

1862
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,400
that's what would happen all the people

1863
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,839
i've seen over the years

1864
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,920
thousands of dollars of supplements in

1865
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,160
their cupboards all junk fillers

1866
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,200
everything everything all packed and all

1867
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,040
that in there

1868
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,160
and and people not getting better with

1869
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,520
all those different ingredients with

1870
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,040
speck of dust and everything

1871
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,880
so you can learn about supplements from

1872
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,839
my directory medicalmedia.com if you

1873
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,799
really want to know

1874
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,599
but the point is is it's it's making

1875
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,640
sure you don't get

1876
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:03,359
cheated making sure you don't get

1877
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,559
cheated it's critical to not get cheated

1878
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,880
so

1879
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,000
let's go into lyme disease because on

1880
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,559
instagram too

1881
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,400
i forgot i forgot that i didn't cover

1882
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,000
lyme disease i want to just cover for a

1883
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,000
couple seconds if you go into lyme

1884
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,040
disease in here

1885
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,040
um in uh cleanse the heel

1886
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:32,880
just trying to find it right here

1887
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,319
um do the owner of lyme disease i talk

1888
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,760
about the true cause of lyme disease

1889
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,280
which is critical to know you'll see

1890
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,720
that here so if you go in here you'll

1891
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,240
see lyme disease and you'll see a whole

1892
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,880
section on the true cause and you can

1893
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,359
read it

1894
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,359
right there okay and

1895
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,760
in lyme disease you'll see the

1896
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,440
supplementation

1897
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,400
right there okay you'll see the fresh

1898
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:58,480
celery juice the reason why that's there

1899
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:00,559
is because it's it's an herbal medicine

1900
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,960
so it's not like why is celery juice

1901
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,960
there you don't see other juices there

1902
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,040
you don't see other juices there you

1903
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,920
don't see a juice you don't see carrot

1904
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,400
juice in there

1905
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,920
that's not herbal medicine you don't see

1906
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,640
and because medical medium information

1907
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,559
is is the only place where we know

1908
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,720
what celery juice does because it's a

1909
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,799
herbal medicine so you'll see that there

1910
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,960
say work up to 32 ounces

1911
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,799
okay and then you go down the list

1912
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,920
you'll see 5 mt at

1913
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:28,720
5 5 mdhf you'll see the folate right

1914
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,960
here

1915
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:33,440
you'll see um um when you go down the

1916
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,200
list you'll see the cat's claw in here

1917
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,720
okay and you might be somebody with lyme

1918
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,319
disease that's sensitive

1919
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,920
to see the cat's that's the vimergy

1920
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,640
cat's claw that's the best one

1921
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,680
out there hands down cat's claws don't

1922
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,319
work out there

1923
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,880
and you'll see curcumin you'll see

1924
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:50,319
glutathione you'll see lemon balm like i

1925
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,799
was talking about there

1926
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,880
now if you're sensitive if you're

1927
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,799
sensitive you just do a tiny drop

1928
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,319
use the technique i talked about use the

1929
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:00,880
whole sensitive technique

1930
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,359
you can take three tiny drops of cat's

1931
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,119
claw

1932
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:05,520
all right but you'll see the cat's claw

1933
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,400
dosage is three dropper volts twice a

1934
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,400
day

1935
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,440
you don't have to go the three dropper

1936
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,079
fulls twice a day

1937
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,040
you can be three tiny drops of cat's

1938
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,000
claw

1939
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,400
a day and you can work your way up you

1940
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,480
can

1941
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,680
customize your protocol you can talk to

1942
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,480
your doctor you can talk to your

1943
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,160
practitioner

1944
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,680
that's how incredible this is then

1945
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,000
you'll see the licorice root

1946
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,799
in in in lyme disease but why is that

1947
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,720
there

1948
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,319
why is that well first of all no one

1949
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,000
used cat's glove for lyme disease until

1950
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,960
medical medium information got out there

1951
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,960
years ago

1952
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,319
because cat's claw kills off viruses

1953
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,200
that cause lyme disease and you'll read

1954
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:40,079
about it

1955
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,680
knowing the true cause of your condition

1956
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:46,000
is how you recover

1957
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:48,319
then knowing what to do and what to use

1958
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,760
and how to do the cleanse there's the

1959
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,920
tools so you can just

1960
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,240
really get you there so then you'll see

1961
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,160
the lysine because it's antiviral you'll

1962
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,119
see the licorice root antiviral you see

1963
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,599
the mullen leaf

1964
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,480
and you go down here you'll see the raw

1965
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,480
honey

1966
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,920
that's another one you'll see the b12

1967
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,119
for the nervous system

1968
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,960
why b12 well nobody knew why medical

1969
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,799
medium information taught people for the

1970
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,079
central nervous system

1971
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:16,319
b12 is for the central nervous system

1972
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,480
because our central nervous systems get

1973
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,240
beaten down by viruses and pathogens

1974
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,000
from neurotoxins that's why we get the

1975
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,039
chronic fatigue syndrome the rheumatoid

1976
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,480
arthritis we get

1977
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,400
the lyme disease we get all these

1978
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,520
different conditions and we get the

1979
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,160
brain fog all that are

1980
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,640
we we get the colitis that's viral too

1981
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:34,799
so

1982
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,559
b12 is for nerves because of viruses

1983
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,839
then you see the vitamin c right there

1984
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,720
then you'll see the zinc

1985
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,160
you'll see a working lyme disease

1986
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,960
protocol

1987
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,520
that doesn't exist anywhere else i don't

1988
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,920
know how

1989
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,520
more i can hold somebody's hand here you

1990
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,280
can take this to your doctor and have

1991
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,960
them work with you on everything in here

1992
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,440
and maybe add to whatever they're doing

1993
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,079
too

1994
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,480
but the point is is that's what this

1995
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,559
book

1996
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,400
is designed for plus you could do you

1997
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,599
can do cleanses and not even go into the

1998
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,599
supplements

1999
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,880
but you have opportunities and choices

2000
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,799
to take it as far

2001
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,839
as you want to go so let's talk about

2002
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,839
children's dosages

2003
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:17,200
i want to go into that a little bit

2004
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:20,720
that's an important thing

2005
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,440
so i'm in cold and flu and cleanse the

2006
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,400
heel

2007
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,680
supplements and dosages right there if

2008
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,640
you don't have the book you might want

2009
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,640
to have the book

2010
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:33,839
um so

2011
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,079
cold and flu and

2012
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,880

supplements for cold and flu for adults

2015
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,559
now why is he talking about cold and flu

2016
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,599
like who cares about cold and flu right

2017
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:48,720
now right we're gonna care

2018
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:50,400
we're gonna care because

2019
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,839
there's gonna be another virus still

2020
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,160
looming around

2021
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:59,039
at the same time flu comes rolling in

2022
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,839
and hammering in pretty rough because it

2023
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,640
does

2024
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:03,200
and so there's a lot to be concerned

2025
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,440
about

2026
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,520
children a lot to be concerned about

2027
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,200
babies lots to be concerned about

2028
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:14,720
adults too but that's why i put this in

2029
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:17,280
here what spirit of compassion foresaw

2030
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,039
was the virus hold the whole virus thing

2031
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,480
spirit of compassion forced all that

2032
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:24,480
i got 35 years of freaking out about

2033
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,680
viruses

2034
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,520
35 years of freaking out about viruses

2035
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,960
to get people safe and get them

2036
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,799
recovered with all their conditions and

2037
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,079
symptoms including flu viruses or

2038
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:36,960
any other manufactured virus that hit

2039
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,760
some scene

2040
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,160
okay whatever all of it and that's the

2041
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,760
whole

2042
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,599
thing medical media information is about

2043
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,240
protecting people about protecting with

2044
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,640
the viral

2045
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,559
viral issues and all of that so when it

2046
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,200
comes down to it

2047
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,480
there's supplements for cold and flus

2048
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,160
for adults but for

2049
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,920
children which is critical because when

2050
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,920
flu season comes and you got

2051
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,039
you got the flu's pounding away in

2052
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,760
december

2053
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,039
and everything else and all that it's

2054
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,559
critical

2055
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,760
i want to talk about lyme disease back

2056
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,039
to lyme disease for one question because

2057
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,440
i saw something there

2058
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,480
lyme is not bacterial just want to cover

2059
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,640
that right there

2060
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,160
and you'll you'll know first of all

2061
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,760
medical medium information pushed lyme

2062
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,520
disease out of the bacterial category

2063
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,520
it's not even in that category anymore

2064
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,799
so lyme disease the lyme labs they don't

2065
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,200
want to lose their their

2066
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,880
billionaire their their empires so the

2067
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,000
lyme labs want to still say it's a

2068
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,359
bacterial because they don't want to

2069
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,119
lose their empires

2070
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:32,880
lyme labs have been bankrolling

2071
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,559
and they're not going to break that but

2072
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,240
science research

2073
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,599
took it out of the bacterial category

2074
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,359
and they put it in the autoimmune

2075
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,640
category that was because medical medium

2076
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,839
books millions of medical media books

2077
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,079
got around the world

2078
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:45,599
and people stopped thinking that lyme

2079
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,280
disease is bacterial anymore

2080
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,559
so people actually know it's viral

2081
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,839
because of the medical medium books if

2082
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,480
you're new to that get the books and

2083
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:52,000
learn

2084
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,680
and so that's why i was talking about

2085
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,960
that so anyway we'll go back to the cold

2086
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,680
and flu supplements

2087
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,240
so here it is supplements were cold and

2088
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,559
flu

2089
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:02,559
in children ages one to two

2090
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,200
all right supplements for colds and flu

2091
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,960
in children ages three to four with

2092
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,839
dosages and protocols

2093
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,559
dosages and protocols for instance

2094
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,039
supplements

2095
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,480
for cold and flu in children ages one to

2096
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,480
two it'll say

2097
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,920
elderberry syrup one teaspoon three

2098
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,520
times a day

2099
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:27,440
uh goldenseal four tiny drops

2100
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,960
not dropper falls three times a day

2101
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,920
you're saying the list goes on and on

2102
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,960
and on

2103
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,640
um and then um and

2104
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,319
and then you got what supplements were

2105
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,280
cold in flu in children from

2106
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:41,280
ages five to eight years old supplements

2107
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,640
for cold and flu in children

2108
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,520
ages nine through twelve supplements for

2109
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,079
colds and flus at ages 13 and up

2110
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,960
so you'll see that's here okay which is

2111
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,960
really uh

2112
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,319
which really powerful information take

2113
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,000
it to your pediatrician

2114
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:57,920
when cold and flu comes or whatever or

2115
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,839
or have your pediatrician have the book

2116
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,119
too

2117
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:02,160
so and you can take to your doctor

2118
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,319
pediatrician

2119
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:06,160
and um and ask them if it's okay for

2120
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,359
your child to have those amounts and

2121
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,960
these dosages

2122
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,200
so that's something that's in here as

2123
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,079
well which is really incredible

2124
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,839
um but the bottom line is it's it's all

2125
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,960
about

2126
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,200
so many options and i walk you through

2127
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,319
it

2128
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,559
to empower you empowerment

2129
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,920
is having an answer to why you're sick

2130
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,039
that's number one

2131
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,720
why am i sick because

2132
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,680
leaky gut is not an answer because

2133
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,559
leaky gut isn't even a real thing i know

2134
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,880
that's like

2135
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,240
hard for people to hear but if someone

2136
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,839
had a leaky gut they would be in the

2137
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,880
hospital with with the temperature of

2138
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:45,920
105

2139
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,240
dying of sepsis see

2140
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,920
what happens is leaky gut isn't wall

2141
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,680
people isn't white people say people

2142
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,440
with diverticulitis

2143
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:58,319
that almost have like a hole in their in

2144
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,480
their colon going to the outside of

2145
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:03,760
their bloodstream

2146
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,079
they don't even they don't even suffer

2147
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,119
from

2148
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,680
like there's people that have

2149
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,200
diverticulitis with holes in their colon

2150
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,640
almost to the other side and they don't

2151
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,079
have symptoms people have they could

2152
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,280
diagnose a leaky gut

2153
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,280
so you have to understand it doesn't

2154
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:19,440
work that way if you even had a

2155
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:22,000
puncture even the sl a passageway

2156
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,359
you'd be like so sick it would be insane

2157
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,440
so i want to go into um

2158
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,719
so leaky gut is just a theory they have

2159
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,080
no proof there's never been a peer

2160
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,560
review study that actually

2161
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,000
showed it happening it's not seeable

2162
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,159
it's not visionable it's not

2163
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,520
known it's it's not even no it's there's

2164
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:36,400
no science research to back it up

2165
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,319
alternatively

2166
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,520
conventionally there's ammonia

2167
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,040
permeability

2168
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,400
so i talk about ammonia permeability

2169
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,040
that's different that's when you have so

2170
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,960
much stuff

2171
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,199
rotting that's impacted in your

2172
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,400
intestinal tract like rancid fats rancid

2173
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:49,600
proteins on the linings of the

2174
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,600
intestinal tract

2175
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,040
and it's creating ammonia gas and that

2176
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,400
ammonia gas will go through everything

2177
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,759
it'll go through your bones it goes up

2178
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,080
to your teeth and rot your teeth at

2179
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,520
night

2180
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:59,120
people are like well why am i losing

2181
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,120
teeth well all that stuff's been

2182
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,920
impacted in them for 30 years 20 years

2183
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,040
15 years

2184
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,400
and their teeth start going that's

2185
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:07,440
ammonia permeability that's different

2186
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,400
let's go into aloe a little bit

2187
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,080
um and when teeth have problems it's not

2188
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,000
from what you're doing that day or that

2189
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,520
time period when teeth have problems

2190
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,440
they develop teeth problems

2191
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,120
that's from 10 years ago what were you

2192
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,799
doing 10 years ago

2193
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,560
what were you doing 15 years ago what

2194
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:24,480
were you doing did you come into this

2195
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,679
world mineral deficient

2196
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:30,080
you know lemon water does not hurt teeth

2197
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,759
um at all because people never did lemon

2198
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,120
water but everybody's in a dentist chair

2199
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,080
getting their teeth drilled

2200
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,759
what did you do in your life in the past

2201
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,359
was it deficiencies what kind of foods

2202
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,719
were you eating 10 years ago because our

2203
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,560
teeth problems don't develop in the

2204
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,560
moment from what we're doing right now

2205
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,199
our teeth problems develop from 10 years

2206
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,359
ago five years ago from eight years ago

2207
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:50,880
so and dentist chairs are filled with

2208
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,759
with people that are eating animal

2209
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,080
protein

2210
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,480
so it's not about plant protein it's

2211
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,760
it's filled with everybody and everybody

2212
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,520
so it's really important to know that so

2213
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,520
here's an aloe leaf right here

2214
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,880
um i talk about i'll leave protocols in

2215
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,679
cleanse to heal the symptoms and

2216
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,080
conditions area

2217
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,920
really important to know there's alola

2218
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,679
leaf so what i like to do is i cut off

2219
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,920
this end because it's extra bitter

2220
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:16,719
i mean i still dig a spoon in there but

2221
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,800
you know i cut off this end right here

2222
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,159
so i mean personally i dig a spoon in

2223
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,360
there and kind of dig

2224
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,800
that out but it's really bitter because

2225
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,239
it's right close to the plant because

2226
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,760
when they pluck the aloe

2227
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,760
they pluck it right off the plant and

2228
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,000
this part right here is really bitter

2229
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,520
that that's really bitter but so i cut

2230
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,719
it off for you guys i figured it's the

2231
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,199
best thing for you guys to

2232
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,159
you know to do too um you can eat the

2233
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,080
aloe

2234
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,440
and you can eat it straight i eat it

2235
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,800
straight okay even though i got the

2236
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,520
medical medium recipes where you can put

2237
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,360
it in a blender and blend it with water

2238
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,719
and drink it down because that's that's

2239
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,920
an amazing way to do it it's an

2240
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,360
incredible way to do it

2241
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,560
i've always talked about that for

2242
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:55,280
decades but i like to eat it straight

2243
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,880
it's quicker for me too you know and and

2244
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,000
so what i do is i cut off a section

2245
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,960
about so big

2246
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,960
just showing you right here

2247
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,400
i just cut off a section of the aloe

2248
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,000
um don't add to food don't don't add

2249
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,120
food in your blender with it or anything

2250
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,960
else you can

2251
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,800
you can you can put your aloe with what

2252
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,280
you're eating and blend it up of course

2253
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,920
you can you can do that i just like to

2254
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,679
do it

2255
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,280
alone because it's more potent as the

2256
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:20,400
medicine it does it brings down the

2257
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,440
acids

2258
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,800
um it gets to the digestive tract on its

2259
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,880
own by itself

2260
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,000
which i really love it's an herb i like

2261
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,360
like to take

2262
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,440
by itself is what it is a wild food i

2263
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,800
like to take by itself

2264
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,560
it's a wild food i like to take by

2265
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,719
itself and so

2266
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,000
um what i do is what i just did now i

2267
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,679
have it right here what i did just

2268
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,840
i took a knife right here and i cut it

2269
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,880
like this

2270
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,199
trying to show you in a different way

2271
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,360
here oh there you go

2272
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,560
okay and i open it up like that then i

2273
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,080
fillet it

2274
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:58,080
i hope i'm not going too fast this

2275
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:00,719
aloe in in um in supplementation

2276
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,400
i hate i hate aloe in supplementation i

2277
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,800
hate aloe and drinks

2278
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,440
meaning not not like making your own

2279
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,560
fresh

2280
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,920
aloe vera water i hate aloe in bottles

2281
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,120
with preservatives because they put

2282
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,360
preservatives in it

2283
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,880
it sits on the shelf in the health food

2284
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,400
store hey i'm going to grab a bottle of

2285
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,840
aloe if that's the only way you can do

2286
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,400
it and that's the only thing you can get

2287
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,000
you can try that but but i personally

2288
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,800
like trying to get a hold of a leaf if

2289
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
you can

2290
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,120
that's my favorite thing to do and um

2291
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,159
so i just laid it back like this i just

2292
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,280
did this

2293
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:34,239
just trying to show you guys i just

2294
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,840
played it played it back like that

2295
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,840
tripping everywhere right now so

2296
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,560
um and then i flayed this piece right

2297
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:42,560
here

2298
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,840
i'm going to flay it again

2299
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,679
so i just laid it again with the knife

2300
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:59,520
i'm probably not doing a great job in

2301
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,159
front of you guys

2302
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,159
as always

2303
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,080
what else do you expect right i'm always

2304
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:10,880
uh messing something up on here

2305
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,640
and then you i eat this i just put it in

2306
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,719
my mouth and just gobble it down right

2307
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,400
that's one side there just knocked it

2308
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,080
off so here's the other side

2309
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,120
and i just flay the other side like this

2310
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:21,120
i play the skin back

2311
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:28,000
try not to get it on the computer too

2312
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:33,840
the camera there you go

2313
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,840
i do that and i flay it

2314
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:43,040
and that's the next piece i take both

2315
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,040
off and i eat it just like that

2316
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:50,320
so that's right there

2317
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,600
and i'll eat it fresh once a day but

2318
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,120
the whole thing is it's great for

2319
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,640
digestive problems i like it for the

2320
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,120
mono eating person

2321
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:59,360
than in the model eating plan in here so

2322
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,600
when you get cleansed of heal

2323
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,840
um you'll see the mono eating diets in

2324
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,600
here um it's mono-eating

2325
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,600
cleanse and you can do that mono-eating

2326
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,560
cleanse for a long time gastroparesis is

2327
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,159
incredible for

2328
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,920
other different symptoms with your

2329
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,960
digestive tract all of it the mono

2330
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,400
eating cleansing here

2331
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,960
it's really great but what

2332
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:20,640
what i like those are like the aloe vera

2333
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,080
kind of mixed in there for people doing

2334
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,719
mono-eating people with digestive

2335
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,560
problems

2336
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,159
people with gut problems and gut issues

2337
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,320
i like having the aloe in there so it's

2338
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:30,719
something right there to think about

2339
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,600
and i mean overall i mean you guys

2340
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,360
cleanse a heel

2341
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,960
i mean check it out these are some of

2342
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,719
the supplement information i can cover

2343
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:40,880
today i'll do another one

2344
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:43,440
there's so much really to cover um

2345
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,960
the books on sale and go to

2346
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,640
medicalmeme.com to the supplement

2347
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,440
directory so you know

2348
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,400
like what is safe what is something that

2349
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,400
i would take

2350
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,520
because that's the whole point and of

2351
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,360
having that there

2352
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,040
because what happens in what people do

2353
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,159
is they end up just getting lost out

2354
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,440
there and then

2355
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,120
how do you get better when you're taking

2356
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,320
the wrong zinc you don't how do you get

2357
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,600
better when you're taking

2358
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,120
crella when you're supposed to be taking

2359
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,080
the right kind of spirulina how do you

2360
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,360
get better

2361
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,840
when you're doing too much nutritional

2362
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,520
yeast with all that msg you don't

2363
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,360
nutritional yeast alone

2364
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,360
can make or break somebody's healing it

2365
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,560
can make or break them healing crossing

2366
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,880
a finish line

2367
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,560
and when you really think about so many

2368
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,000
obstacles and so many problems that

2369
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,800
could get in the way that's why these

2370
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,640
books have

2371
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,159
people who actually are able to read

2372
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,199
these books focus

2373
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,800
and actually just really take it

2374
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:32,640
seriously and move forward with it or

2375
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,239
take it to the doctor that really

2376
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,840
cares about them and wants to help work

2377
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,960
with them the people who move forward

2378
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,920
they're the people who

2379
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,600
who do um it's not just like oh i tried

2380
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,760
celery juice for five days

2381
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,960
and you ended up doing an hpp one on the

2382
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,840
shelf of the of the

2383
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,239
health food store that was like high pr

2384

01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:47,040

2415
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,440

all of it um yeah

2425
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,960
so all of the whole thing is just

2426
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:14,480
because i like

2427
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,000
thorn doesn't mean i like all of their

2428
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,760
products that's not it at all so

2429
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,920
just know that i like their gaba and i

2430
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,400
like their 5mthf

2431
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,760
um i like their methylfolate but it

2432
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,520
doesn't mean i like all their products

2433
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,520
don't get confused at that

2434
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,120
check my directory so you know because

2435
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,239
my directory changes a lot at

2436
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:32,480
medicalmedium.com

2437
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,600
because if you go there you'll see that

2438
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,320
you know i might like

2439
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,760
one product from thorn or two products

2440
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,480
but i don't like the rest of them

2441
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,640
because of

2442
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:42,480
all kinds of different pitfalls they

2443
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,199
have in them it's the same thing with a

2444
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,800
lot of products

2445
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,120
vimergy i like all of their products

2446
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,800
because they're like exceptionally above

2447
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,880
board like vimergy that company right

2448
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,560
there visa and victor i am ergy

2449
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,480
they're exceptionally above board i like

2450
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,080
every product they come out with

2451
01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:00,800
um they keep it so fair and so straight

2452
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,440
and it's really unbelievable what

2453
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,520
they've done

2454
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,640
it's the quality and everything about it

2455
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,159
you know here's the licorice from

2456
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,159
vimergy right here

2457
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,080
um but i like a few different companies

2458
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,400
i like a bunch of companies but i only

2459
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,840
like

2460
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,840
certain things from some of these

2461
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,600
companies because they blow it

2462
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,080
in so many other ways with other

2463
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,920
products they just blow it it's it's

2464
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,120
it's incredible how it works

2465
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,880

01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,880

2470
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,199

2471
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:37,280
incredible company they're good people

2472
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:40,320
they're incredible mom and pop company

2473
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,280
they don't care about spending money on

2474
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,600
the product

2475
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,880
they'll spend money on the product when

2476
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,400
other companies won't

2477
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,080
venergy also gets every single product

2478
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,320
individually tested for toxic heavy

2479
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,920
metals other companies don't

2480
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,040
because it costs too much money so you

2481
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,320
have to understand what you're dealing

2482
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,360
with when you're dealing with a really

2483
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,880
good company

2484
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:04,960

your body hard with some alcohol

2510
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,560
