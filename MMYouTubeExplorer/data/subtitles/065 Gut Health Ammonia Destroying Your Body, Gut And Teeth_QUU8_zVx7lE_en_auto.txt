[1.28 - 7.72] how many people do you know who struggle
[4.32 - 10.24] with their health chances are whether
[7.72 - 14.48] they show it or not most of the people
[10.24 - 17.56] in your life do and chances are you're

[25.88 - 31.24] fatigue or any other symptom or
[28.44 - 34.52] condition you're far from from
[31.24 - 38.64] alone living with symptoms has become
[34.52 - 41.72] The New Normal so no more guessing games
[38.64 - 44.72] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.36] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.72 - 52.00] William today we're talking about gut
[47.36 - 54.40] health exactly the guts your gut
[52.00 - 57.56] everyone's gut because what people need
[54.40 - 61.16] to understand is that medical research
[57.56 - 64.76] and science doesn't understand stand
[61.16 - 68.84] it's feeble at best because let's face
[64.76 - 71.40] it how the gut functions it's a mystery
[68.84 - 74.00] no one knows what really happens when
[71.40 - 77.96] food enters the stomach the digestive
[74.00 - 81.24] system is a miracle phenomenon beyond
[77.96 - 83.44] anything anyone can perceive they don't
[81.24 - 86.48] have a window into it they don't know
[83.44 - 88.88] what really happens when food hits the
[86.48 - 92.08] stomach never mind food hitting the
[88.88 - 94.80] mouth in this episode we're talking
[92.08 - 97.16] about the ghost inside your body and I'm

[198.52 - 202.28] okay I'll I'll talk to you soon bye
[200.96 - 204.92] you've probably heard of leaky gut
[202.28 - 207.88] before I remember when leaky gut hit the
[204.92 - 211.12] town and it just took off and it was
[207.88 - 212.96] like the answer for everything years ago
[211.12 - 214.68] a little history lesson right here if
[212.96 - 217.24] you don't know when you're new in health
[214.68 - 219.56] and or you just got sick or you're
[217.24 - 223.44] somebody that just wasn't aware of this
[219.56 - 226.28] but leaky gut was one of those panaceas
[223.44 - 230.08] that solved everything but yet solved
[226.28 - 232.20] nothing cuz nobody got better back then
[230.08 - 235.44] it was just oh you got leaky gut you got
[232.20 - 238.76] leaky gut alternative medicine took that
[235.44 - 241.48] leaky gut they ran with it and ran with
[238.76 - 244.12] it they would not stop that went along
[241.48 - 247.00] with candida of course you either got a
[244.12 - 249.20] Candida diagnosis or a leaky gut
[247.00 - 253.40] diagnosis and then sometimes you get
[249.20 - 256.44] both now back then 10 20 30 years ago
[253.40 - 259.52] alternative medicine wasn't ined with
[256.44 - 261.60] conventional medicine now it is you guys
[259.52 - 262.88] they're in bed together and then the
[261.60 - 266.36] lines are
[262.88 - 269.36] blurred but back then they weren't so
[266.36 - 272.64] conventional medicine was like there's
[269.36 - 275.44] no way someone has leaky gut because
[272.64 - 278.52] leaky gut to us conventional medicine
[275.44 - 281.12] would be a puncture inside the
[278.52 - 284.60] intestinal tract or the colon or in the
[281.12 - 287.84] stomach or dadum and that puncture would
[284.60 - 291.60] allow contents from the intestinal tract
[287.84 - 294.80] to leak into the bloodstream of the body
[291.60 - 297.20] or leak into a different Avenue of the
[294.80 - 299.76] body then the person would get an
[297.20 - 301.64] infection they would be in the hospital
[299.76 - 304.16] they'd have a fever maybe even a really
[301.64 - 307.44] high fever or a low grade fever too for
[304.16 - 310.00] a while and then they would get
[307.44 - 312.68] sepsis and be really sick and
[310.00 - 315.00] potentially die that was leaky gut
[312.68 - 316.76] syndrome to Conventional medicine back
[315.00 - 319.12] then I'm not talking about 100 years ago
[316.76 - 323.08] I'm talking about 10 years ago 15 years
[319.12 - 325.96] ago 20 that was the definition of leaky
[323.08 - 330.36] gut from conventional medicine's point
[325.96 - 333.64] of view alternative medicine was just a
[330.36 - 337.04] term not understood though not
[333.64 - 338.48] understood but a term leaky gut it was
[337.04 - 340.68] like the answer for everything at the
[338.48 - 342.72] time now there was no science for
[340.68 - 345.56] alternative medicine or conventional
[342.72 - 347.68] medicine that deemed leaky gut as a
[345.56 - 349.40] possibility alternative medicine didn't
[347.68 - 351.60] have an answer they did not have a
[349.40 - 353.88] microscope inside somebody's intestinal
[351.60 - 355.72] tract looking at the possibility of
[353.88 - 358.16] contents leaking from their intestinal
[355.72 - 361.52] tract into their bloodstream it didn't
[358.16 - 365.16] happen it just wasn't there science did
[361.52 - 369.60] not see it nobody saw it it was a theory
[365.16 - 371.64] it was 100% a theory and nothing but a
[369.60 - 373.48] theory that somebody had leaky gut and
[371.64 - 375.08] that's why they were struggling so when
[373.48 - 377.32] a patient came to an alternative
[375.08 - 380.72] doctor's office I was like well I'm
[377.32 - 383.68] fatigued I don't feel good I'm not well
[380.72 - 386.36] I got aches and pains I got brain fog
[383.68 - 388.20] I'm bloating what is it and then
[386.36 - 390.16] alternative medicine would be like well
[388.20 - 392.64] I think you got leaky guts in
[390.16 - 395.04] like whoo leaky gut syndrome now I have
[392.64 - 397.24] an answer I can take that and do
[395.04 - 399.96] something with it it's not that they saw
[397.24 - 403.04] the person had a leaky gut nobody knew
[399.96 - 406.24] there was no test that determin it truly
[403.04 - 409.12] it was just a guess or a theory and a
[406.24 - 411.80] guess just compiled onto itself but the
[409.12 - 416.12] health movement back then was Barren it
[411.80 - 418.92] was dry it was like a desert and people
[416.12 - 422.24] were thirsty you're sick for enough
[418.92 - 424.04] years you hit a new alternative doctor
[422.24 - 426.16] it's the year
[424.04 - 430.32] 2002 it's the Year
[426.16 - 432.60] 1997 it's the year 2010 and when you hit
[430.32 - 435.04] that alternative medicine clinic and a
[432.60 - 437.92] doctor's like you got leaky gut and it's
[435.04 - 442.28] like The Thirst is quenched in that
[437.92 - 444.72] moment Hallelujah there's an answer here
[442.28 - 447.48] I'm not thirsty anymore let me drink
[444.72 - 450.24] this up you leave on a high it was a
[447.48 - 453.68] miracle moment in Alternative Health but
[450.24 - 455.96] really it was just a theory but you know
[453.68 - 457.68] what when you got stuff in your head
[455.96 - 460.20] like that and you've been looking for a
[457.68 - 462.64] long time it makes sense my gut is
[460.20 - 464.88] leaking darn it that's what it is
[462.64 - 467.40] because everything I eat matters and
[464.88 - 469.28] what I'm doing matters my stomach my gut
[467.40 - 471.04] I don't feel good it has to all stem
[469.28 - 473.28] from the gut and it was the perfect
[471.04 - 476.04] opportunity for alternative medicine to
[473.28 - 478.20] look good especially since conventional
[476.04 - 479.96] medicine was torturous at the time for
[478.20 - 482.44] so many people
[479.96 - 485.76] absolutely torturous all they did was
[482.44 - 488.96] offer a steroid an antibiotic an
[485.76 - 490.00] anti-depressant an anti-anxiety Med a
[488.96 - 493.08] benzo
[490.00 - 495.32] aspine some type of anti-inflammatory
[493.08 - 498.68] and you're on your way didn't matter
[495.32 - 501.40] what was going on where who when unless
[498.68 - 503.48] you broke your leg or your penic
[501.40 - 506.24] exploded and you needed emergency
[503.48 - 507.96] surgery other than that and maybe a few
[506.24 - 509.72] other things that are life- saving of
[507.96 - 512.48] course conventional medicine is life
[509.72 - 515.08] saving but when it comes down to chronic
[512.48 - 518.04] illness it was just emptier than
[515.08 - 520.40] alternative medicine truly emptier you
[518.04 - 523.84] ran through gamma of tests didn't have
[520.40 - 525.48] any answers and you went home to feed it
[523.84 - 528.44] everybody went home to feed it and it
[525.48 - 531.04] even happens now till this day even with
[528.44 - 533.88] conventional medicine being married now
[531.04 - 536.64] to alternative medicine like it is it's
[533.88 - 540.16] still defeating in so many ways but back
[536.64 - 542.44] then getting an answer was everything
[540.16 - 545.00] so let's hit leaky gut for a little bit
[542.44 - 547.96] so when people were getting a leaky gut
[545.00 - 552.00] diagnosis it wasn't about other things
[547.96 - 554.80] like ulcers diverticulosis
[552.00 - 556.56] diverticulitis Pockets that were in the
[554.80 - 559.64] intestinal tract or colon that were
[556.56 - 562.64] highly inflamed and very damaged with
[559.64 - 565.72] scar tissue it wasn't about these things
[562.64 - 568.56] at all these things weren't even in the
[565.72 - 569.92] picture this was just people who've
[568.56 - 572.20] already had
[569.92 - 573.64] colonies endoscopies they've already had
[572.20 - 575.68] you know people looking inside the
[573.64 - 577.64] intestinal tract they had
[575.68 - 579.28] cameras everywhere inside their
[577.64 - 580.20] intestinal tract but they still didn't
[579.28 - 582.80] have
[580.20 - 585.92] answers it was people that just didn't
[582.80 - 587.80] feel good for all these other reasons or
[585.92 - 589.56] having all these other symptoms were
[587.80 - 591.68] given these leaky gut
[589.56 - 594.88] diagnosis so it's very different if
[591.68 - 597.88] somebody has an ulcer that's blowing up
[594.88 - 600.56] exploding inside their gut an ulcer in
[597.88 - 603.04] their stomach the water them and that
[600.56 - 606.00] Ulster is a bleeding hemorrhaging
[603.04 - 608.80] uler and there could be a possible
[606.00 - 612.08] Fisher or window into the other side of
[608.80 - 614.92] that area leaking things into the
[612.08 - 616.88] bloodstream very different right there
[614.92 - 620.44] or a puncture which happens when people
[616.88 - 623.76] get colon oopes the camera goes up they
[620.44 - 625.88] roll it out and it punctures people's
[623.76 - 628.28] colons and now they're in the hospital
[625.88 - 630.12] for 4 months 6 months 2 months because
[628.28 - 632.08] they have a puncture and they're
[630.12 - 634.56] fighting for their lives with
[632.08 - 637.16] sepsis it's different than anything like
[634.56 - 640.40] that leaky gut that was happening with
[637.16 - 643.08] people wasn't for any reason besides you
[640.40 - 644.84] don't feel good you got leaky gut when
[643.08 - 648.64] it comes to the alternative theory of
[644.84 - 650.92] leaky gut it's Advanced along the years
[648.64 - 653.20] now it's all about different things that
[650.92 - 655.32] are happening medical communities and
[653.20 - 658.80] alternative medicine describe a
[655.32 - 660.08] condition in which mold or fungus like
[658.80 - 662.64] candid
[660.08 - 665.32] or unproductive bacteria Thrive and
[662.64 - 667.64] burrow tiny holes in the Linings of the
[665.32 - 669.32] intestine and cause micro levels of
[667.64 - 672.16] toxins to leak directly into the
[669.32 - 674.40] bloodstream resulting in a multitude of
[672.16 - 677.00] symptoms there are different variations
[674.40 - 679.72] of this belief and they all mimic each
[677.00 - 682.24] other though now having an intestinal
[679.72 - 687.40] tract filled with unproductive bacteria
[682.24 - 689.84] unproductive mold yeast different fungus
[687.40 - 692.20] having an intestinal tract fil with all
[689.84 - 694.96] of that can give you symptoms there can
[692.20 - 697.08] be problems you can have a strep you can
[694.96 - 699.04] have an eoli you can have different
[697.08 - 702.48] bacteria causing different problems in
[699.04 - 705.00] the intestinal tract for many reasons
[702.48 - 709.00] and doing different things but that's a
[705.00 - 711.36] far cry from leaky gut if these
[709.00 - 715.48] pathogens were truly Crossing
[711.36 - 719.80] barriers if unproductive fungus candida
[715.48 - 722.08] mold were crossing into the blood stream
[719.80 - 724.04] from the intestinal tract lining or
[722.08 - 726.00] entering into the body through the
[724.04 - 729.04] intestinal tract in any way the stomach
[726.00 - 731.28] dadum the colon if that was happening
[729.04 - 734.56] there would be a war going on and
[731.28 - 737.08] somebody would be bedridden sick with
[734.56 - 739.56] fevers and levels of toxins in their
[737.08 - 742.52] bloodstream creating a sepsis a chronic
[739.56 - 745.00] sepsis all the time now the hospital
[742.52 - 746.76] would know that they would have sepsis
[745.00 - 748.60] it would be a mystery maybe to how it's
[746.76 - 750.04] happening it would be a mystery to why
[748.60 - 752.52] they have sepsis
[750.04 - 754.96] but if there were holes throughout the
[752.52 - 758.32] intestinal tract or colon and bacteria
[754.96 - 760.64] was crossing barriers Crossing that
[758.32 - 763.72] lining and all kinds of other different
[760.64 - 766.36] fungus and yeast and mold and other
[763.72 - 768.92] toxins were crossing out of that
[766.36 - 772.60] intestinal environment into the body in
[768.92 - 774.80] some way they would know it's sepsis
[772.60 - 776.92] they would know we have a problem and
[774.80 - 778.72] maybe a really smart doctor might be
[776.92 - 780.88] like wo this could be coming from
[778.72 - 782.36] somewhere maybe it's coming from the gut
[780.88 - 784.88] somewhere and there's some kind of
[782.36 - 788.32] fisser there's some kind of opening but
[784.88 - 789.96] that's a far cry and very different so
[788.32 - 792.20] different from a whole host of other
[789.96 - 794.92] symptoms that are created from inflamed
[792.20 - 797.84] neurological systems and brain
[794.92 - 800.12] inflammation and viruses and metals and
[797.84 - 802.52] other toxins and so forth it would be
[800.12 - 804.12] much different than the sepsis somebody
[802.52 - 806.84] would have in the hospital where they
[804.12 - 808.88] would be identifying that really easy
[806.84 - 811.44] and that would be like okay now that
[808.88 - 813.36] would be a leaky gut if there was really
[811.44 - 816.28] a passageway through the intestinal
[813.36 - 817.88] tract into the body but this is much
[816.28 - 819.88] different than people being sick or
[817.88 - 822.16] vetan with neurological conditions
[819.88 - 824.24] chronic illness aches and pains body
[822.16 - 827.16] aches and pains all kinds of different
[824.24 - 829.44] issues far different than that but what
[827.16 - 831.52] happens with leaky gut enthusiasts
[829.44 - 834.36] doctors that believe in leaky gut in the
[831.52 - 836.24] way they do they'll just package it all
[834.36 - 838.60] up and that's what they did years ago
[836.24 - 840.72] alternative medicine packaged everything
[838.60 - 843.92] up in into leaky gut you walk through
[840.72 - 845.92] the door with all your host of symptoms
[843.92 - 849.88] everything you're suffering from neck
[845.92 - 852.68] pain ear pain vertigo dizziness ringing
[849.88 - 855.40] in the ear tingles and numbness back
[852.68 - 857.36] pain leg pain feet pain insomnia
[855.40 - 859.84] whatever it was it would be like okay
[857.36 - 861.80] this is leaky gut and so let's treat it
[859.84 - 865.24] and that's what's going on and the sad
[861.80 - 868.32] part was they were wrong and it wasn't
[865.24 - 869.72] it wasn't Lecky gut it was other things
[868.32 - 872.60] viral infection
[869.72 - 876.48] Epstein bar which originally starts as
[872.60 - 879.40] mononucleosis hhv6 simplex one Simplex 2
[876.48 - 882.76] setav virus shingles
[879.40 - 885.72] hhv7 different forms of bacteria like
[882.76 - 887.64] strep lots of toxic heavy metal exposure
[885.72 - 890.32] throughout an entire lifetime and even
[887.64 - 892.16] before passed down from generations and
[890.32 - 894.56] generations all kinds of different
[892.16 - 897.00] toxins and poisons chemicals and so
[894.56 - 899.04] forth and antagonists neuro antagonists
[897.00 - 900.84] that everybody gets exposed to to f
[899.04 - 902.80] Pharmaceuticals people drink in their
[900.84 - 904.24] water and don't even realize it from all
[902.80 - 907.36] kinds of different pharmaceutical
[904.24 - 910.76] exposure all of this plus radiation
[907.36 - 914.24] pesticides herbicides DDT all of the
[910.76 - 916.24] above is happening but yet it's all
[914.24 - 919.44] blamed on leaky gut as if that was what
[916.24 - 921.48] it was but it wasn't even when people
[919.44 - 923.52] deal with fatigue and aches and pains
[921.48 - 927.60] and constipation and digestive
[923.52 - 929.72] discomfort acid reflux even them those
[927.60 - 931.88] people are not dealing with leaky gut
[929.72 - 934.76] they're dealing with other problems like
[931.88 - 937.00] low hydrochloric acid ammonia problems
[934.76 - 939.96] which we're going to explore in a minute
[937.00 - 943.00] liver issues stagnant sluggish toxic
[939.96 - 945.80] livers and then pathogens all throughout
[943.00 - 947.96] the body all of that plus weak nervous
[945.80 - 950.48] systems they're suffering with all of
[947.96 - 953.40] this but it gets packaged up as if it's
[950.48 - 955.28] this leaky gut thing when it's not as
[953.40 - 957.68] the years went by leaky gut syndrome
[955.28 - 960.40] turned into a new label a new
[957.68 - 963.16] identification which was intestinal
[960.40 - 965.68] permeability it was a newer version of
[963.16 - 967.72] leaky gut the reason why because leaky
[965.68 - 969.64] gut never made sense to begin with and
[967.72 - 971.92] they knew it along the way and we're
[969.64 - 974.16] like wait a minute this isn't leaky gut
[971.92 - 977.20] so let's call it intestinal permeability
[974.16 - 979.68] so the name changed it was meant to give
[977.20 - 982.48] the illusion of progress but it wasn't
[979.68 - 985.92] progress but what really is happening
[982.48 - 988.40] inside people's guts is ammonia
[985.92 - 991.32] permeability ammonia is a gas that's
[988.40 - 994.32] produced when something's rotting when
[991.32 - 995.72] something's rotting in someone's gut so
[994.32 - 998.00] what's happening out there is people
[995.72 - 1000.92] have gut rot instead of leaky gut
[998.00 - 1003.08] syndrome they have gut rot a prime
[1000.92 - 1006.20] example of this is when somebody eats
[1003.08 - 1008.88] beans and they don't digest properly
[1006.20 - 1011.64] because their liver is weakened stagnant
[1008.88 - 1015.36] sluggish their hydrochloric acid is very
[1011.64 - 1018.40] low to zero their bio reserves inside
[1015.36 - 1020.84] their liver is low to zero in many
[1018.40 - 1023.88] people so what happens is when someone
[1020.84 - 1025.84] eats a whole bowl of beans they don't
[1023.88 - 1028.56] digest and break down properly and they
[1025.84 - 1031.52] start to rot they rot inside the gut
[1028.56 - 1033.68] it's called Bean rot something similar
[1031.52 - 1035.88] happens with nuts so many people eat
[1033.68 - 1038.60] gobs of nut butter or they eat a lot of
[1035.88 - 1040.20] nuts out of hand and what occurs is that
[1038.60 - 1042.28] their liver is too weak their bio
[1040.20 - 1044.36] reserves are too low their hydrochloric
[1042.28 - 1047.44] acid is too low and then the nuts begin
[1044.36 - 1049.64] to rot it's called nut rot this can also
[1047.44 - 1052.12] happen with eating poultry any kind of
[1049.64 - 1054.28] turkey or chicken or any kind of other
[1052.12 - 1056.12] Bird that's eaten what happens is the
[1054.28 - 1057.68] body doesn't digest it properly through
[1056.12 - 1059.64] all those avenues that I talked about
[1057.68 - 1062.16] before with nut rot and bean rot and you
[1059.64 - 1065.60] get poultry rot this could happen with
[1062.16 - 1068.00] fish too Snapper tuna Cod halib bit
[1065.60 - 1070.20] Trout the stomach can't break it down
[1068.00 - 1071.76] properly because the HCL is low the bio
[1070.20 - 1073.92] reserves are low and can't break down
[1071.76 - 1076.20] any of the fats and then the liver is
[1073.92 - 1079.16] too stagnant and sluggish and what you
[1076.20 - 1083.88] have is fish rot same thing happens with
[1079.16 - 1085.72] meat beef pork lamb these foods are hard
[1083.88 - 1087.96] to digest when someone's digestive
[1085.72 - 1091.28] system is weakened and in turn you get
[1087.96 - 1093.32] meat rot it doesn't stop there either
[1091.28 - 1096.12] when someone's eating chocolate and
[1093.32 - 1098.20] maybe somebody you know notice this or
[1096.12 - 1101.16] maybe it happened to you later on you
[1098.20 - 1103.72] get a really bad breath a real stink
[1101.16 - 1105.40] coming out of you right off your breath
[1103.72 - 1107.68] someone might say hey that's chocolate
[1105.40 - 1109.88] but really someone might also say what's
[1107.68 - 1113.20] rotten and what ST thinks it's rotting
[1109.88 - 1115.96] chocolate it's chocolate rot the stench
[1113.20 - 1118.76] that a lot of people think is hosis just
[1115.96 - 1121.72] plain old bad breath or dental problems
[1118.76 - 1123.56] is really the stench of ammonia food
[1121.72 - 1126.24] that's rotting in the gut doesn't just
[1123.56 - 1127.80] stop rotting in one day it could sit
[1126.24 - 1130.08] there and rot for
[1127.80 - 1132.40] days sometimes people have enough food
[1130.08 - 1134.92] in their intestinal tract to rot for
[1132.40 - 1138.08] weeks and some people have food sitting
[1134.92 - 1139.40] in their guts rotting for months as the
[1138.08 - 1143.08] food rots
[1139.40 - 1145.88] ammonia gas is produced and that ammonia
[1143.08 - 1148.60] gas seeps past the lining of the
[1145.88 - 1151.16] intestinal tract and colon and even
[1148.60 - 1154.00] stomach lining and dadum and it enters
[1151.16 - 1155.84] the bloodstream that ammonia gas travels
[1154.00 - 1158.52] through the bloodstream into every
[1155.84 - 1161.72] single organ in the body but that's just
[1158.52 - 1164.92] one Avenue the ammonia gas travels it
[1161.72 - 1168.12] also travels through artery walls the
[1164.92 - 1169.32] Linings of veins it travels through
[1168.12 - 1172.40] anything
[1169.32 - 1175.76] it's like a ghost and it moves through
[1172.40 - 1178.52] bones not just in Bones it moves through
[1175.76 - 1181.16] them this ammonia gas doesn't just leave
[1178.52 - 1184.68] the body through the armpits or through
[1181.16 - 1188.00] sweat when someone works out it leaves
[1184.68 - 1191.20] every orus every single cell every part
[1188.00 - 1193.20] of the skin it leaves your skull at the
[1191.20 - 1194.88] top of your head it goes through
[1193.20 - 1197.12] everything and it leaves the body in
[1194.88 - 1198.88] every way you would think that's a good
[1197.12 - 1201.88] thing then it just travels out of the
[1198.88 - 1205.08] body and it leaves us but no it also
[1201.88 - 1208.00] stays behind it's a ghost that leaves
[1205.08 - 1211.08] and stays it's everywhere saturates all
[1208.00 - 1213.64] the tissue every cell every organ the
[1211.08 - 1216.20] entire bloodstream the lymphatic system
[1213.64 - 1218.32] and yet still gases out and leaves us
[1216.20 - 1221.24] but there's always more to come more to
[1218.32 - 1224.12] be produced it's always there one of the
[1221.24 - 1227.40] most annoying parts of ammonia
[1224.12 - 1228.96] permeability is when it enters the mouth
[1227.40 - 1231.52] especially when somebody's sleeping at
[1228.96 - 1234.56] night and they're just laying down the
[1231.52 - 1237.56] ammonia gas produced by rotting food in
[1234.56 - 1239.68] the gut doesn't just go through the
[1237.56 - 1242.24] intestinal lining and into the
[1239.68 - 1245.76] bloodstream it goes up the intestinal
[1242.24 - 1249.48] tract it floats up it's a ghost that
[1245.76 - 1252.20] floats upward so it starts heading up
[1249.48 - 1254.92] into the dadum and it heads into the
[1252.20 - 1257.32] stomach up the esophagus and into the
[1254.92 - 1259.20] mouth and then it sits there while
[1257.32 - 1262.76] somebody's sleeping
[1259.20 - 1265.80] why should that be a problem one is it
[1262.76 - 1268.80] starts to affect oral health it starts
[1265.80 - 1272.68] to cause teeth problems over time bad
[1268.80 - 1275.36] teeth problems ammonia gas just doesn't
[1272.68 - 1278.44] move through bones it just doesn't move
[1275.36 - 1281.16] through organs it moves through teeth
[1278.44 - 1283.96] and when ammonia gas moves through teeth
[1281.16 - 1285.72] it weakens teeth now you might say Well
[1283.96 - 1288.80] when it moves through bones it weakens
[1285.72 - 1290.92] bones but not exactly it does doesn't
[1288.80 - 1293.08] just weaken bones what happens with
[1290.92 - 1296.04] bones is there's not a lot of oxygen
[1293.08 - 1298.24] inside the body not compared to oxygen
[1296.04 - 1302.08] inside your mouth so what happens when
[1298.24 - 1304.48] ammonia gas reacts with oxygen from
[1302.08 - 1307.76] breathing air in and then the ammonia
[1304.48 - 1310.88] gas entering the mouth from down below
[1307.76 - 1313.40] the two mix and it becomes more damaging
[1310.88 - 1316.52] to teeth causing teeth problems quickly
[1313.40 - 1318.84] versus bone problems quickly in the body
[1316.52 - 1322.32] the oxygen that enters our mouth helps
[1318.84 - 1325.44] to keep oral problems down it's one of
[1322.32 - 1327.80] the self-protecting built-in mechanisms
[1325.44 - 1330.60] that we have as human beings we breathe
[1327.80 - 1333.56] in air through our mouth and the oxygen
[1330.60 - 1336.16] levels are high keeping bacteria to a
[1333.56 - 1338.52] certain level lower instead of really
[1336.16 - 1341.36] high what happens with ammonia
[1338.52 - 1343.84] permeability and then ammonia gas when
[1341.36 - 1346.28] the ammonia leeches into the mouth it
[1343.84 - 1348.24] starts to lower the oxygen levels
[1346.28 - 1350.68] meaning bacteria in the mouth grows
[1348.24 - 1352.64] faster fter so if somebody has
[1350.68 - 1354.52] deficiencies for years mineral
[1352.64 - 1357.00] deficiencies their teeth are already at
[1354.52 - 1359.20] a weakened state or they're high intoxic
[1357.00 - 1362.40] heavy metals or they have pathogens such
[1359.20 - 1364.64] as viruses and food deficiencies
[1362.40 - 1368.60] nutrient deficiencies antioxidant
[1364.64 - 1371.32] deficiencies B12 deficiencies if you
[1368.60 - 1373.68] compile ammonia permeability on top of
[1371.32 - 1376.12] those deficiencies then you have a real
[1373.68 - 1380.76] problem so oxygen diminishes in the
[1376.12 - 1384.00] mouth ammonia Rises bacteria Rises and
[1380.76 - 1386.00] teeth and gums get worse one thing that
[1384.00 - 1388.84] happens though is when someone builds up
[1386.00 - 1391.52] their HC they're breaking down proteins
[1388.84 - 1393.84] better they build up their liver their
[1391.52 - 1397.36] BS breaking down and dispersing fats
[1393.84 - 1400.76] better their digestive system is getting
[1397.36 - 1405.68] stronger they're healing but they have a
[1400.76 - 1408.16] past a past history of decades or years
[1405.68 - 1409.28] and years of ammonia permeability and
[1408.16 - 1411.68] Amon
[1409.28 - 1416.00] damaging teeth so
[1411.68 - 1419.00] then Father Time kicks in and that teeth
[1416.00 - 1420.96] damage shows later even when they're
[1419.00 - 1424.92] healing and getting stronger and
[1420.96 - 1427.56] healthier the past shows up and the
[1424.92 - 1430.00] teeth start to show what happened
[1427.56 - 1432.28] especially if people were eating vinegar
[1430.00 - 1433.76] and drinking vinegar all these years
[1432.28 - 1436.36] especially if they were doing apple
[1433.76 - 1439.24] cider vinegar shots and apple cider
[1436.36 - 1442.24] vinegar chews all these years the apple
[1439.24 - 1444.28] cider damages teeth all on its own but
[1442.24 - 1447.40] it also doesn't help ammonia
[1444.28 - 1450.40] permeability it worsens it creating more
[1447.40 - 1452.52] ammonia gas people's refrigerators are
[1450.40 - 1455.64] filled with condiments and they eat
[1452.52 - 1459.24] these condiments and in these condiments
[1455.64 - 1461.40] is vinegar or vinegars even apple cider
[1459.24 - 1465.00] vinegar a lot of people use it as a
[1461.40 - 1467.96] staple in their dressings on their food
[1465.00 - 1468.88] in their sauces and vinegar damages the
[1467.96 - 1471.52] liver
[1468.88 - 1474.48] and it injures the HCL production with
[1471.52 - 1477.24] the stomach glands your gastric glands
[1474.48 - 1479.52] over the years it contributes to ammonia
[1477.24 - 1482.44] permeability and ammonia gas
[1479.52 - 1485.56] production another ammonia producer is
[1482.44 - 1488.48] salt an overload of salt not just
[1485.56 - 1491.28] minimal on the salt or small amounts of
[1488.48 - 1493.80] salt let a people over Sal their food or
[1491.28 - 1496.28] eat restaurant food that's overs salted
[1493.80 - 1499.04] what happens with salt is it injures the
[1496.28 - 1501.88] gastric glands it slows down the liver's
[1499.04 - 1504.96] function and salt itself when saturated
[1501.88 - 1507.92] in the bloodstream it reacts to ammonia
[1504.96 - 1511.20] gas Just Like Oxygen reacts to ammonia
[1507.92 - 1514.56] Gas Salt reacts creating a much more
[1511.20 - 1517.04] potent form of ammonia gas this is
[1514.56 - 1519.08] different from natural occurring sodiums
[1517.04 - 1523.16] like the sodium cluster salts in celery
[1519.08 - 1525.52] juice which neutralize ammonia gas the
[1523.16 - 1529.16] sodium in celery juice and the sodium in
[1525.52 - 1531.84] leafy greens like spinach and lemon
[1529.16 - 1534.44] is a neutralizer it's there to keep a
[1531.84 - 1536.64] sodium balance in the bloodstream a
[1534.44 - 1540.04] natural occurring sodium
[1536.64 - 1543.20] balance another problem with gut rot are
[1540.04 - 1546.48] fats that go rancid a lot of people have
[1543.20 - 1549.12] high fat diets overt fats are in their
[1546.48 - 1552.48] diet morning noon and night or even if
[1549.12 - 1555.04] it's once a day overt fats and what
[1552.48 - 1558.52] happens is if the blood gets thick and
[1555.04 - 1561.80] fat and stagnant and sluggish and the
[1558.52 - 1564.00] ammonia gas has a field day it could get
[1561.80 - 1567.36] trapped in places you don't want it
[1564.00 - 1570.28] trapped in special places like nerves
[1567.36 - 1572.08] like the Vegas nerves a hypers sensitive
[1570.28 - 1574.56] nervous system one that's already
[1572.08 - 1576.84] dealing with pathogen exposure like
[1574.56 - 1579.32] neurotoxins produced by Epstein bar
[1576.84 - 1582.80] virus can be highly sensitive to ammonia
[1579.32 - 1585.20] permeability ammonia gas this affects
[1582.80 - 1587.60] nerve response time when somebody has a
[1585.20 - 1589.48] thought there's a delay like they think
[1587.60 - 1591.12] about lifting their arm and they lift
[1589.48 - 1593.92] their arm when somebody has a thought
[1591.12 - 1595.56] about running there's a slight delay a
[1593.92 - 1598.00] lot of people run into this with loved
[1595.56 - 1600.24] ones or they say something and they get
[1598.00 - 1602.92] an answer back with a little bit of a
[1600.24 - 1604.64] delay the ammonia gas can produce this
[1602.92 - 1606.96] type of delay when it affects the
[1604.64 - 1609.68] central nervous system so how do we
[1606.96 - 1612.28] reverse ammonia permeability how do we
[1609.68 - 1615.12] reverse ammonia production inside our
[1612.28 - 1617.96] body we have to restore the hydrochloric
[1615.12 - 1620.96] acid levels we have to restore our liver
[1617.96 - 1623.32] those are the two main things to restore
[1620.96 - 1625.56] the hydrochloric acid level you have to
[1623.32 - 1628.04] bring back those gastric glands you have
[1625.56 - 1630.60] to strengthen them so as we're
[1628.04 - 1633.48] revitalizing our gastric glands and
[1630.60 - 1635.56] making our hydrochloric acid stronger
[1633.48 - 1637.40] we're up against something that
[1635.56 - 1641.44] everybody's up against pretty much every
[1637.40 - 1643.64] day which is stress everyday stress and
[1641.44 - 1645.28] stress puts people in fight ORF flight
[1643.64 - 1647.76] when we're in fight or flight our
[1645.28 - 1650.08] adrenals are releasing adrenaline that
[1647.76 - 1653.40] adrenaline is toxic to the gastric
[1650.08 - 1656.16] glands keeping HCL down low so we have
[1653.40 - 1659.44] to work harder and longer to restore it
[1656.16 - 1662.52] and Revitalize it so what do we do how
[1659.44 - 1664.80] do we fix this how do we stop gut rot
