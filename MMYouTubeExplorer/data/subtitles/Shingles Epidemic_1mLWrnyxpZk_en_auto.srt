million listens over a million

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,879
listens and they were suddenly taken

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,760
down a few few months ago not by us by

10
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:39,800

are some of the announcements but today

60
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,120
we're talking about shingles shingles

61
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,800
shingles this is going to be good we're

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,200
going to cover some detailed information

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,280
it's critical for people who are

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,440
chronically my mysteriously suffering

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,239
from chronic illness if that made any

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,480
sense people are struggling out there

67
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,840
suffering with symptoms and may not

68
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,920
realize or don't realize or highly doubt

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,239
they realize that the shingles can be

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,360
behind why they are suffering why they

71
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,560
are struggling the shingles and I'm

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,640
talking about the shingles on a rooftop

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,319
talking about the shingles on somebody's

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,480
body or in their body without having a

75
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,760
rash and that's interesting because

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,560
we're going to cover that topic too

77
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,439
because medical research and science

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,519
without a study is just starting to talk

79
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,200
about shingles viruses with no rashes

80
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:37,439
present internal shingles that's

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,280
interesting because who right here

82
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,120
published almost a decade ago I was the

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,720
first to talk about that that shingles

84
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,959
variey is without rash is because of

85
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,599
spirit of

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,720
compassion exactly how would I ever know

87
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,920
that how would I ever find that out it

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,079
never existed anywhere published here

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
first medical research and science

90
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,920
almost a decade later are starting to

91
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,519
talk about it they don't have a study

92
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,480
where did they get the information I

93
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,079
wonder because millions of copies of the

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,159
medical medium book One have gone around

95
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,879
the globe and countless doctors are

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,959
using them and so forth all around the

97
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,319
globe right scientists and everything I

98
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,280
wonder where they got that non rashing

99
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,799
shingles thing that they don't have a

100
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,079
study for incredible so this is good so

101
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,680

102
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,720

the current beliefs of medical research

173
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,639
and science one way that you can't get

174
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:23,639

anyway contrary to the current beliefs

186
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,000
of medical research and science one way

187
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,360
that you can't get shingles is through

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,080
chickenpox did you hear what I just said

189
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,560
your doctor May tell you that if you've

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,599
had chickenpox sooner or later you'll

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,280
get

192
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,560
shingles they'll say sooner or later

193
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,080
you'll get shingles if you had

194
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,960
chickenpox you'll get shingles okay now

195
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,759
they're going to take this too I know

196
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
it's coming I know because a birdie in

197
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,639
my

198
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,879
ear named s so birdie and my ear is

199
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
telling me they're going to go with this

200
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,960
one next and it's coming it's kind of

201
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,680
exciting by the way biggest mistake they

202
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,080
made they say shingles is contagious

203
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,319
we're going to go into that part yet

204
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,959
with I can't wait this is not the case

205
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
the only thing chickenpox has in common

206
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,959
with shingles is that they're both

207
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,440
viruses in the herpes family that can

208
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,479
cause a rash what that means you guys

209
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,080
chickenpox isn't the shingles they're

210
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,920
not the same thing they've been feeding

211
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,720
that one that's a huge mistake by the

212
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,040
industry they've been feeding that huge

213
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,839
mistake to people for decades and

214
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,040
decades what a lame mistake me km says I

215
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,959
never had chickenpox and I have shingles

216
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,720
indeed you're right and and yeah that's

217
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,240
how it works because they're two

218
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,399
different bugs a major mistake in the

219
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,640
medical world two different bugs and

220
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,120
just like they made a mistake because

221
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,480
they didn't know about the non rashing

222
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,360
shingles until they took it from the

223
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,160
medical medium book just that mistake

224
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,440
alone here's the second mistake they're

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
going to have

226
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,560
to they're going to have to chalk up

227
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,320
they're going to have to cough up and

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,480
that second mistake is

229
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,880
coming chickenpox is an entirely

230
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,079
different species of herpes

231
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,279
virus from shingles entirely

232
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,519
different

233
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:44,200
chickenpox shingles or shingles

234
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,240
chickenpox shingles

235
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,040
chickenpox

236
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,640
exactly they essentially have nothing to

237
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,320
do with each other nothing to do with

238
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,959
each other yeah so they're going to take

239
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,279
that too coming up pretty soon

240
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:02,720
eventually you're going to see something

241
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,079
come up and it's going to be like we've

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,839
just discovered that chickenpox is not

243
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,839
the shingles they're two different

244
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:12,800
viruses but there there what it is is

245
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,200
they're going to be busted I have

246
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,160
delivered that information for decades

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,560
published it in here many years ago and

248
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,079
talked about it for years okay why are

249
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,160
we being told shingles is chickenpox

250
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,040
related when it's not why are we being

251
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,360
told that

252
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,240
this is a prime example of

253
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,680
misinformation that was accepted at one

254
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,680
point because it sounded like it made

255
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,959
sense it was a theory that sounded like

256
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,120
it made sense just like the autoimmune

257
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
theory that sounded like it made sense

258
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
where your body is attacking itself but

259
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,639
your body isn't attacking itself because

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,440
that's a theory that they never proved

261
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,279
they never witnessed an auto antibody

262
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,760
under a microscope attacking a gland or

263
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,920
a cell or an organ you guys

264
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,639
they never witnessed the immune system

265
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,760
attacking a gland or an organ it was

266
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,200
never witnessed it still isn't today

267
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,680
millions of people are walking into

268
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,000
their doctor's offices getting

269
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,120
autoimmune diagnosis and with not a

270
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,560
shred of proof that their body is turned

271
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,120
on them or their body has even gone

272
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,399
after a gland or an organ or tissue it

273
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,959
is made up made up BS by the

274
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,839
industry and everybody's just sucker it

275
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,440
into it and that's the world we live in

276
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,600
and if you know how the world works and

277
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,160
how corrupt the world is overall with

278
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,360
different different things realize it's

279
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,839
corrupt in everything and that's part of

280
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,240
it right there all in its own you guys

281
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,839
somebody just asked what book it is it's

282
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,240
a medical medium New Edition medical

283
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,240
medium book one New Edition it's an

284
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,839
incredible book talks about epscene bar

285
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,200
talks about the shingles talks about the

286
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,120
conditions and symptoms it creates Ms

287
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,160
fibromyalgia thyroid problems

288
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
hypothyroid all of it is in here this

289
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,160
thing's packed it's jam-packed with

290
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,120
protocols and in information that's

291
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,959
mindblowing okay this is prime example

292
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,480
of misinformation that was accepted at

293
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,760
one point because it sounded like it

294
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,560
made sense then was perpetuated to the

295
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,639
point where it's now ingrained we have

296
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,720
it ingrained in everybody's

297
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,760
Consciousness it's like very deep in

298
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,199
their skull in their brain that shingles

299
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,800
means chickenpox they're the same thing

300
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,519
once you had chickenpox you're going to

301
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,440
have shingles which is nonsense that's

302
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,160
not how it works not to mention that

303
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,639
medical research and science don't have

304
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,240
a lot of accountability when it comes to

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,600
viruses no they don't we know that

306
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,120
already just from

307
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,199
2020 they lack information and know very

308
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,160
little in this area the plague of sea

309
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:49,079
has shown this to be true we know what

310
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm talking about the plague of sea okay

311
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,680
still till this day I'm not going to

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,240
mention that

313
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,240
word it's the best I can all right let's

314
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,040
go into it a little bit shingle

315
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,120
transmission and triggers as with as

316
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,199
with any virus in the herpes family

317
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,199
there are numerous ways to catch

318
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:14,120
shingles to catch it to transfer it you

319
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,240
can get it passed down from your

320
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,839
parents you can get it through a

321
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,519
transfusion of infected

322
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,480
blood you can get it through an exchange

323
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,600
of bodily fluids you can get the

324
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,240
shingles through and exchange of bodily

325
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
fluids very easily from a public

326
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,120
bathroom

327
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,639
from a handle on a carriage in the

328
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,040
grocery store you can get shingles

329
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,320
easily just see you now and even from

330
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,880
the blood from a chef's finger from the

331
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,399
knife chopping up your food in the

332
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,639
restaurants the biggest mistake they

333
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,720
made they say

334
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,560
shingles is

335
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,240
contagious if it's contagious then you

336
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,480
can straight up catch Jingles you don't

337
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,279
need

338
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,199
chickenpox huh

339
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,480
what wait a minute what did I just say

340
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,079
that's the most screwed up thing I've

341
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,399
ever heard come out of my

342
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:12,360
mouth I mean jeez looks like I'm getting

343
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,680
something going on there on tick so

344
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,759
yeah

345
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,120
so I can just tell you right now when

346
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,959
you think about this think about this

347
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,959
think about how crazy this is right

348
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:29,839
so if shingles is

349
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,759
contagious right

350
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,440
and then you can catch shingles from

351
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,279
someone else who has

352
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,680
shingles where's the chickenpox

353
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,720
part where does that go what happened

354
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,240
there with

355
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,519
chickenpox someone please tell

356
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,920
me I'm confused I'm scratching my head

357
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,800
on that

358
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,240
one think about this one is this not M

359
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,160
blowing right they say that you can only

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,519
get shingles from chickenpox so you have

361
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,000
to have chickenpox first and then it

362
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,959
soals goes dormant in the body and then

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,160
you get shingles later on in your 50s

364
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,720
and 60s when you're 50 years old when

365
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,959
you're 60 years old that's when you end

366
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,160
up getting chickenpox right that's what

367
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:16,639
we're told so this is kind of funny

368
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,440
because I'm thinking about this for a

369
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,399
minute because how does that work so if

370
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,959
someone has shingles and then you go

371
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,199
near them and they have shingles you

372
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,600
catch the shingles from them but you

373
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,160
don't catch

374
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,920
chickenpox how in

375
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:38,480
the

376
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:41,920
world does that work Bust It bust it

377
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,480
again once again bust it they didn't

378
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,600
think that went through when they told

379
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,519
everybody shingles is chickenpox all

380
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
these decades all these doctors were

381
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,880
told in medical school that chickenpox

382
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,800
is shingles never saw a shred of

383
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,920
evidence or proof I know I've talked to

384
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,040
doctors that have gone through medical

385
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,480
school no one's ever seen a petri dish

386
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,880
or or something under the glass the

387
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,519
looking glass of a scope that determines

388
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,959
what the difference is there or anything

389
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,120
about it so here you are you're told

390
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,759
that shingles is chickenpox you have to

391
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
catch chickenpox first or have

392
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,800
chickenpox and then it goes dormant and

393
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,600
then your shingles comes out like 50

394
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,839
years later how's it possible that you

395
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
can catch then shingles directly from

396
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,279
somebody who has shingles you should

397
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,880
then really technically catch chickenpox

398
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,160
everybody should be getting chickenpox

399
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,880
from somebody who has shingles and it

400
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
must start start off that way before it

401
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,160
becomes shingles 50 years from that huge

402
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,399
mistake bust it once again let's go into

403
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,319
this a little bit signs you could be

404
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,680
suffering from the onset of a shingles

405
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:45,160
infection include flu like fever and

406
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,880
chills feeling headaches or migraines

407
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,240
aches and pains burning pain itching

408
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,000
tingling and rash puls or blisters if

409
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,880
it's an actual rashing shingle if it's a

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,279
non- rashing shingle you're not going to

411
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,480
see it on your body you're not going to

412
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,240
see the

413
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,800
rash medical communities believe that

414
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,839
those last two symptoms red rash and PS

415
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,039
always accompany shingles in fact this

416
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,559
is merely the classic presentation of

417
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:14,480
one type only of the Zer virus so this

418
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,319
leads us into the next thing here okay

419
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,120
if medical research and science are now

420
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,400
saying because they took from medical

421
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,760
medium book one here they took the

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,919
information that there's more than one

423
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,079
varieties of shingle there they took the

424
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,240
information of that there's this non

425
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,679
rashing variety of shingle that sits

426
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,720
inside somebody and they call it

427
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,039
internal shingles

428
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,720
right they're really saying there's more

429
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,480
than one variety and that's the whole

430
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,480
point in this book I talk about how

431
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,919
there's more than one variety there's

432
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,440
over 30 varieties and even more and it's

433
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:49,400
climbing because of mutations because of

434
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,400
people Contracting them and spreading

435
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,559
them so the classic herpes Zer virus is

436
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,080
you get it across one side like on the

437
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,760
side here of the rib or somewhere in the

438
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,320
back right here or you get a strip of it

439
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,679
along your back or on your side or maybe

440
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,960
down here lower by your butt right and

441
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,960
you get the strip have anybody have you

442
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,400
guys ever had that right the classic

443
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:19,880
herpy Zer variety that's one right there

444
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,960
okay and that's one type if a patient

445
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,600
displays PS and blisters that look

446
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,960
different then the barcode style rash

447
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,400
and the blisters and pbls are in unusual

448
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,720
areas doctors often won't consider it

449
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,640
shingles at all but now they do now they

450
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,400
do 10 years ago when this book was was

451
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,400
okay put into

452
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,360
motion medical research and Science and

453
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
medical doctors only believed in the

454
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,320
classic variety of shingles where it was

455
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,080
just this one strip on you and it had to

456
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,760
be

457
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,120
textbook

458
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,120

00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,080

okay all right let's go into it a little

474
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:38,520
bit deeper we talked about transmission

475
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:41,280
it's easy to

476
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,559
catch if the medical

477
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,480
world in the medical world shingles

478
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,960
seems like an open and shut case you got

479
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,799
a patient with the textbook rash skin

480
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,280
pain on one side That's all

481
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:58,320
folks close the case close the door on

482
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,400
the case but it's changing now so so

483
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,120
let's go into some other different stuff

484
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
we're talking about classic shingles and

485
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,320
we're going to cut into some of these

486
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,520
other ones there are seven strains of

487
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,240
shingles that cause rashes you guys you

488
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,559
might be able to identify some of the

489
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,919
stuff happening in your life through

490
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,039
this right here while the resulting PS

491
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,120
are painful if they're in an easy to

492
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,880
spot location that the doctor Associates

493
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,120
with the standard variety of shingles

494
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,400
then they look like the classic

495
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,520
perversion doctors are accustomed to

496
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,280
seeing in medical school in a sense that

497
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,280
they can be a blessing it's that one

498
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,960
classic variety of herpes

499
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,679
Zer because the rash makes it more like

500
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,919
that your doctor will see and realize

501
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,720
what you have and that's helpful and

502
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,080
they won't call it idiopathic so they

503
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,120
won't say you just have this strange

504
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,640
rash we don't know what it

505
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,960
is okay however most shingles rashes may

506
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,799
be unidentifiable to the doctor because

507
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,520
of their location and pattern let's cut

508
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,960
into some of these all right we talked

509
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,360
about the classic shingles let's move on

510
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,080
upper body sh shingles let's hit that

511
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,480
one the rash appears from the chest

512
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,880
up that's that's a shingles variety

513
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,320
where the rash appears from chest up

514
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,919
okay on the upper chest shoulders or

515
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,760
neck but not on the arms this rash is

516
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,720
the closest in appearance to the most

517
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,840
common shingles variety so that's an

518
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,000
entirely different strain so when

519
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,320
anybody has shingles from chest up neck

520
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,960
top of shoulders chest up that's a

521
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,600
different variety of shingles

522
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
these are important to know if you've

523
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,600
been somebody that's your plagued with

524
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,440
trigeminal neuralgia and you got aches

525
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
and pains and you got all kinds of

526
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,799
different fatigue and other issues

527
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,880
constantly and nerve pain and you're

528
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,480
you're you're squeezing your teeth down

529
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,520
and crunching them up and breaking them

530
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,679
in the middle of the night you got to

531
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:49,039
wear a mouth guard all the time like all

532
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,320
this is good information that's one

533
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
variety here's another variety of

534
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,240
shingles both arm

535
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,880
shingles you can get them on both arms

536
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,600
okay rash appears EX exclusively on both

537
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,320
arms and on both

538
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,360
hands also the rash has an altered

539
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,880
pattern somewhat spotty with large and

540
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,120
small P sometimes spaced apart on arms

541
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,600
and hands that's a variety all on its

542
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,559
own that's not the chickenpox bug that's

543
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:23,279
not the chickenpox virus it's not that's

544
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,000
its own separate okay identity its own

545
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,279
separate virus by the way there's a

546
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,159
reason why I have all this food here

547
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,799
because I'm going to talk about how sh

548
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,360
Les loves these Foods we're going to go

549
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,240
into that a little bit here's one right

550
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,679
here one arm

551
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,679
shingles the rash appears on one arm

552
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:44,559
only it can be either arm but not both

553
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:49,200
arms it's one arm only so you get the

554
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,320
shingles rash on one arm and one arm

555
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
only okay this breakout also has an

556
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,520
altered pattern somewhat spotty with

557
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,600
large and small Pall spaced apart let's

558
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,080
hit another one head shingle

559
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:06,000
brutal people

commit life ending because of it I have

561
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,559
to not say that word or I'll probably

562
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:16,400
lose Tik Tock but people commit the end

563
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:19,520
of life if you know what I mean from

564
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,919
head shingles that's how bad head

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,400
shingles is for so many people where

566
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,320
they get the shingles on their head or

567
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
they get it somewhere in their mouth or

568
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,400
they just get it in their sinuses and

569
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,440
their head

570
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,760
face the yeah people don't want to live

571
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,320
when they have that happens all the time

572
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,240
out there it's really

573
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,200
sad the rash appears on the top and the

574
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,000
sides of the head including the face

575
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,360
also you can have this variety inside

576
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
the mouth on the tongue throat or

577
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,840
anywhere else in the

578
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,799
mouth

579
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,080
shingles can be really bad it can kill

580
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,159
someone it can it's life-threatening

581
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,720
there's different variety ities there's

582
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,080
like I'm reading here your classic

583
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,559
shingles other varieties of shingles but

584
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,000
somebody can have more than one variety

585
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,840
of shingles they can have two or three

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,600
varieties of shingles but can be

587
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,320
lifethreatening

588
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,240
that's how bad shingles can hurt and be

589
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,320
someone may have to be literally on

590
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,960
morphine prescribed by their doctor

591
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,200
because are the neurologist or so forth

592
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,880
because shingles can get so bad could be

593
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,840
on the face head it could be in the

594
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,919
mouth it could be on the tongue it could

595
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,799
be in the throat in the

596
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:36,799
throat which is

597
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,080
brutal it can be right in the tongue it

598
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,760
could be all in the mouth and it can be

599
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,080
on the hypoglossal nerves the cranial

600
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,360
nerves going through here it can be on

601
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,200
like the Ooa Factory nerve you got the

602
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:51,080
hypog glassa nerve you the facial nerve

603
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,480
you got it can be anywhere in these

604
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,799
nerves which is just really

605
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,159
brutal the resulting PS are tinier than

606
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,640
those of the above strains so it's

607
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,159
different than your regular herpes Zer

608
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,399
that's on the side of you

609
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,240
right and they sometimes have little

610
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:13,720
horns on top you can get a variety of

611
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,000
shingles in the mouth on the face on the

612
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,960
tongue that have

613
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,720
horns like

614
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,399
horns and they're just brutal so many

615
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,000
people have lived like this still doe

616
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:27,000
today they get it out there and they and

617
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,360
medical communities often misdiagnose

618
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,120
this type as a fungus that needs to be

619
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,399
treated with antifungal or steroid

620
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:39,320
cream

621
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:40,919
mistake major mistake which leads to

622
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,720
terrifying

623
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,640
stuff so when someone literally is

624
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,600
suffering and they have shingles in

625
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,679
their mouth and their throat and they're

626
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:54,039
in Untold Agony that no one can ever

627
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,520
understand because their nerves are so

628
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,919
lit up in their cranial area their

629
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,440
facial nerves are so lit up their their

630
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,399
hypoglossal nerve is literally so lit up

631
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,960
they got the shingles eating away at the

632
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:11,840
nerves and just ripping into their mouth

633
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,840
and then the medical communities believe

634
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,480
it's a fungus that needs to be treat it

635
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,799
with an antifungal or steroid cream dear

636
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,240
Lord dear

637
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,240
Lord dear

638
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,120
God I can't even

639
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,080
inset yep aaine over there on YouTube

640
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,840
says what about shingles in the back and

641
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,240
sciatic nerves indeed of course we're

642
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,559
going to talk about

643
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,440
that okay let's head into the next one

644
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,240
both leg

645
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,919
shingles rash appears on both legs one

646
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,679
leg two

647
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,760
leg rash appears on both legs but

648
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,720
nowhere else it has a different

649
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,600
appearance than standard shingles with

650
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,080
pbls that look almost like

651
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,559
constellations up in the sky right

652
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,240
there's the little dipper there's the

653
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,200
Big

654
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,760
Dipper I mean I've talked to people

655
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,640
throughout the the years throughout the

656
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,200
decades and doctors where it's like

657
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,679
there's constellations on them where

658
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,440
it's like the Little Dippers on their

659
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:18,120
leg the big dippers on their leg

660
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,279
Yeah

661
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,159
constellations th says over there on

662
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,679
YouTube my mother also had it on the

663
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,880
left side of her body and on her back

664
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,360
and she also had it lingering nerve pain

665
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,720
for about a year and a half it was quite

666
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,200
horrible for her can you imagine in your

667
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,200
mouth in your throat or on the head on

668
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,159
the ear with your throat and mouth how

669
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,240
bad that could be people get it all the

670
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,120
time out there it's devastating tragic

671
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,480
actually

672
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,720
tragic so the both leg shinkles shows up

673
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,320
like all these different pretty

674
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,360
constellations as if you're looking at

675
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,880
the stars up there

676
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,240
right okay go a little bit

677
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,640
vaginal area

678
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,679
shingles this is a very bad bad bad

679
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,159
variety of

680
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,640
shingles and it's its own strain and

681
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:14,159
it's brutal and it's caused a lot of

682
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,760
problems with women they suffered

683
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,279
greatly with

684
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,760
this and I've heard stories out there

685
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,480
and I've seen things and I've talked to

686
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,960
doctors and top Specialists throughout

687
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,360
the years and people have ended their

688
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,880
lives because of this variety of

689
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,880
shingles affecting only women this

690
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,360
strain causes a rash that appears

691
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,279
outside but near the V vagina between

692
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,159
the rectum and vagina or on Lower

693
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,799
buttocks or inside the crotch area The

694
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,960
Strain is especially notable because

695
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,360
doctors often misdiagnose it as sexually

696
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,640
transmitted herpes okay so there's a

697
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,240
shingles

698
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,960
variety that gets a misdiagnosis all the

699
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,640
time of sexually transmitted Herpes

700
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:09,720
Simplex 2 think about that right how

701
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,200
many women have this Jingles virus but

702
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:16,039
it's misconstrued and misdiagnosed as

703
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:20,039
herpes simplex 2o think about that

704
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:22,399
right that's that's devastating for a

705
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:24,600
lot of women but there are more women

706
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,880
getting diagnosed with this variety of

707
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,440
shingles which is not on the docket the

708
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,559
medical research and science dock it yet

709
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,480
remember this is all advanced

710
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,760
information and research and science

711
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,360
just took recently they just took the

712
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,320
non- rashing shingles part out of this

713
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:42,120
book but they're they're going to

714
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,440
they're going to get other pieces and

715
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,039
they're going to take other pieces out

716
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,240
of this book as well as we go as they go

717
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,480
along they don't care they're

718
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,559
Shameless so this strain is notable

719
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,480
because doctors often misdiagnose it as

720
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:58,640
a sexually transmitted herpes creating

721
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,080
unnecessary emotional pain for hundreds

722
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,279
of thousands of women globally it's a

723
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,640
shingles

724
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,080
variety that's between the vagina and

725
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,960
the rectum or other areas in the crotch

726
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,480
and so forth that is an ongoing

727
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,000
infection of shingles that just comes in

728
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:19,240
goes and gets diagnosed as herpes

729
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,880
simplex 2 by the

730
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,080
system the primary way to tell these

731
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,080
illnesses apart is that the strain of

732
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,039
the shingles virus we're talking about

733
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,440
causes substan IAL pain while genital

734
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,440
herpes herpes simplex virus 2 HSV 2 is

735
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,960
typically less painful this variety of

736
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,519
shingles virus is so

737
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,679
painful but doctors they're just like

738
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,159
well I know we think it's Simplex 2 but

739
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,440
it's so painful it's far more painful

740
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,000
than Simplex 2 this shingles virus I'm

741
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:57,760
talking about vaginal area shingles

742
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,960
virus is far more painful than Simplex 2

743
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,720
also this shingles virus creates puls

744
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,080
that are relatively spread out in the

745
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,840
genital area and lower buttocks while

746
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,279
hsv2 pules tend to Cluster within a

747
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,600
small

748
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:17,559
area so hsv2 Herpes Simplex 2 clusters

749
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,279
in a small

750
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:25,679
area and right and there you go and the

751
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,440
uh this variety of vaginal shingles

752
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,000
tends to spread out more

753
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,639
okay and that's a brutal variety of

754
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,960
shingles let's go into shingles

755
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,440
neurotoxin talk a little bit for a

756
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,679
couple of minutes shingles neurotoxin

757
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,320
talk all right one of the misconceptions

758
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,360
about shingles is that the virus is

759
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,840
lurking directly within the skin

760
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,279
rash that's never the case the virus

761
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,480
lies much deeper underneath the skin and

762
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:52,399
even inside the bloodstream and liver at

763
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,639
the very same time positioning itself

764
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,960
for the most effective inflammatory

765
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,039
possibility on your nervous system so

766
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,559
what this means

767
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:06,080
is that medical research resarch and

768
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,720
science thinks it's really at the right

769
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,559
by the P it's the P right they think

770
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,360
it's there but really it's positioned

771
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,840
deeper and even in the liver in other

772
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,000
place it's still contagious but it's

773
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,600
deeper in organs and in the

774
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,600
bloodstream however the virus releases a

775
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,360
unique mix of neurotoxin so the virus

776
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,679
releases a neurotoxin it eats food it

777
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,679
likes right it eats cheese

778
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,880
like nice right it eats cheese it loves

779
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,559
butter this is what it eats the shingles

780
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
viruses all eat

781
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,000
butter

782
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,240
butter they do so when someone's dealing

783
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,559
with chronic shingles and chronic

784
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,559
shingles and they're suffering in all

785
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:50,519
kinds of different ways don't even

786
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,200
realize it they don't even need a rash

787
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,200
the non- rashing variety and they're

788
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,080
suffering they're eating butter and

789
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,360
their viruses are staying alive cuz the

790
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,519
viruses are eating the butter they're

791
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,080
having a field day they love gluten

792
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:06,960
nobody knew

793
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,639
that hey W gluten has been around a long

794
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,399
time you're not the man that discovered

795
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:14,720
gluten no I'm not but s so is the one

796
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,760
that discovered that viruses such as

797
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,720
shingles and epine bar feed off of

798
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,080
gluten and nobody knew that nobody knew

799
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,480
that gluten fed anything in the medical

800
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,639
industry or the Alternative Health

801
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,840
industry nobody knew that gluten fed

802
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:30,760
things like bugs that's mm info I'm only

803
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,799
reminding people you'll see it out there

804
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,720
now cuz it's constantly poached and

805
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,399
never cited

806
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,200
okay another food right here right

807
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:43,799
cheese gluten right there okay this is

808
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,039
interesting so the sushi so the

809
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,799
sushi why should that do anything or why

810
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,080
should that be a problem such a healthy

811
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:53,799
food it's like real food so many

812
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,799
different influencers eat it all the

813
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,279
time I mean if you just look around and

814
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:59,080
you see influencers out there there

815
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,440
they're all like sushi out that's what

816
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,399
they do right it's every night but what

817
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,600
happens is viruses like epine bar and

818
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:09,560
shingles feed off the mercury in the

819
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,119
tuna they feed off the mercury in the

820
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,040
tuna that creates a really good

821
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,480
neurotoxin for viruses eventually

822
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,119
Landing somebody with a sickness at some

823
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,960
point because the viruses will get

824
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,240
stronger and stronger and stronger as

825
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,879
they're feeding off of more and more

826
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,919
Sushi which is the

827
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,720
tuna the

828
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,320
Mercury

829
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,679
okay the virus releases a unique mix of

830
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,200
neurotoxin and dermatoxin combined

831
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
here's the difference between an Epstein

832
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,040
bar I'll just use this for an Epstein

833
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,000
bar right now okay the difference with

834
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,440
an epine bar is it releases a neurotoxin

835
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,480
when it eats its favorite foods okay

836
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,520
like cheese it'll release a

837
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,640
neurotoxin but not necessarily A

838
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,040
dermatoxin so much it can can release a

839
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,160
dermatoxin but not all varieties of

840
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,280
epine bar release a dermatoxin just some

841
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,200
okay the difference

842
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,119
with

843
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,040
shingles is it will release a unique

844
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:15,520
blend of neuro and Derma that's the

845
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,320
difference right there with the

846
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,520
shingles and in these seven strains I'm

847
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,440
talking about the viral poison travels

848
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,240
outward to the periphal nerves and

849
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,119
lights you on fire and then you're on

850
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,440
fire suffering from

851
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,320
shingles all right let's hit shingles

852
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,839
without rashes for a little bit too okay

853
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,839
it's got so much to cover and a lot of

854
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
information good to see you guys coming

855
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,320
on here

856
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,400
great lots of fun stuff to talk about

857
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,599
and I'm also going to share the book

858
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,079
because everybody keeps on asking this

859
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,560
is medical medium book one New Edition

860
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,839
when you read this book you'll be mind

861
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,280
blown this this book speaks to the soul

862
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,520
of the person who's

863
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,240
suffering it speaks to the person who's

864
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,359
been the the underdog it speaks to the

865
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,960
person who has been misunderstood it

866
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,240
speaks to the person who has been living

867
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,680
with symptoms that maybe aren't visible

868
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,839
and they're suffering inside they're

869
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,920
tormented inside but their symptoms

870
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,880
aren't really exhibiting on the outside

871
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,200
so that people see and they're like you

872
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,000
look good you look great how are you

873
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,680
doing and you're like no I don't feel

874
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,079
good I got tightness of the chest I

875
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,839
don't feel good I'm tired all the time I

876
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,680
got brain fog I got like OCD and all

877
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:33,240
kinds of different problems now and I'm

878
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,359
not doing good and that's what this

879
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,839
speaks to because the information in

Incredible Book make sure you check it

885
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,800
out we're into shingles right now a

886
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,520
little bit and you guys just before we

887
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,000
move on to the non- rashing shingles

888
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,640
which I'm excited to talk talk about I

889
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,960
just want to say if you just got on here

890
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,839
okay check out medical medum podcast at

891
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,720
Apple podcast I put out a new episode

892
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,359
it's about drinking it's about drinking

893
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,280
I got to be careful my word choices here

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,160
it's about

895
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:19,200
drinking don't miss it and check out my

896
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,680
telegram please because the four platter

897
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,000
shows are back they were removed months

898
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,280
ago not by me I mentioned this earlier

899
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,160
and now they are back and you'll hear

900
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,000
why and how when you listen to the

901
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,160
telegram on on what happened okay let's

902
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,040
go into shingles without

903
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,000
rashes the eight non rashing strains

904
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,319
produce a neurotoxin and they hurt they

905
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,760
hurt so what people need to understand

906
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,160
is these non rashers really hurt bad

907
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,000
let's hit one right here neuralgic

908
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,599
shingles also known as diabetic

909
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,040
neuropathy does anybody have diabetic

910
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,000
neuropathy or does anybody have

911
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,119
neuropathy because I said this for years

912
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
that there were more people with

913
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:09,720
neuropathy than there were with diabetic

914
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,920
neuropathy just for the record right

915
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,880
there another thing that I think the

916
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,720
industry is now taken from this book I

917
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,680
think I saw it like a year ago out there

918
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,240
and there's diabetic neuropathy but

919
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,760
that's only some people with diabetic

920
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,280
neuropathy they're diabetics with

921
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,480
neuropathy all diabetic neuropathy is

922
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,480
you guys is a

923
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,680
diabetic with

924
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,040
neuropathy and then there's all these

925
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,920
other people that aren't diabetics and

926
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,760
they got

927
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,440
neuropathy there's more people with

928
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,760
neuropathy than there is with people di

929
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,480
that diabetics with neuropathy okay all

930
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,440
right just want to make sure that's

931
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,520
clear all right neuralgic shingles which

932
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,960
primary attacks the lower extremities

933
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,160
creating nerve pain like numbness

934
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,079
burning in in the legs burning in the

935
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,000
feet it's often called diabetic

936
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,720
neuropathy and misidentified as a

937
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,079
complication of diabetes this is a huge

938
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,880
medical myth that needs to be debunked

939
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,880
unless there's an obvious injury or

940
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,359
imped to the nerves the sensations a

941
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,480
patient is feeling is not

942
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,680
neuropathy it's something else it's the

943
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,079
shingles it's inflamed nerves because of

944
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,599
non rashing shingles I wanted to cover

945
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,680
that a little a bit if you know anybody

946
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,599
dealing with

947
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,920
neuropathy okay take this book to your

948
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,920
doctor and say is it the

949
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,560
shingles let's see p fiction says I get

950
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,720
neuropathy but I'm not

951
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,440
diabetic I I believe that because people

952
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,400
that's what happens there's so many more

953
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,960
people that are not diabetic that have

954
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,520
neuropathy there's so many more it's way

955
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,880
more than anybody can imagine actually

956
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,480
all right so I talking about about that

957
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,599
um okay this variety of shingles occurs

958
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,079
more often in patients without diabetes

959
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,119
than in patients with

960
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,640
diabetes so Sophie norstrom says what is

961
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:12,520
neuropathy it's a mysterious condition

962
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,440
medical research and science doesn't

963
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:17,880
quite understand entirely they just know

964
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,800
it as pain they just know it as nerve

965
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,280
pain they believe happening in the

966
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,359
legs primarily in the legs that's what

967
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,079
they've said all these years okay

968
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,599
let's go a little bit deeper in let's go

969
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:34,560
into this this variety of of um shingles

970
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:37,160
this is a non rashing we're a non

971
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,079
rashing varieties you guys here's one

972
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:44,880
maddening itch shingles so maddening

973
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,960
itch shingles okay like crazy just just

974
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,000
itchy you can't reach the itch you can't

975
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,319
reach it you can scratch all you want

976
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,560
but you can't you can't get in there you

977
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,720
can't reach it all

978
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
right this virus creat creates a

979
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,560
continually moving itch that can't be

980
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,640
scratched that's because the virus is

981
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,480
irritating nerves too far beneath the

982
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,319
skin to be reached with fingers that's

983
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
your

984
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:12,839
nerves it's like I'm itchy all the time

985
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,000

almost touch it it almost feels good but

987
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,920
it's not enough you're not finding the

988
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,119
spots because the itch is deeper that's

989
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,960
what variety that is if the virus is

990
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:29,359
empowered by a weak immune system and or

991
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:33,400
by triggers stick of butter some gluten

992
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,119

shingles non rashing vaginal shingles

1006
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,599
okay this virus affects only women it

1007
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:16,079
goes deep into the inner vaginal walls

1008
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,960
and inflames the nerves there okay it

1009
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,640
also travels inside the bladder and

1010
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,720
rectum to wreak additional Havoc

1011
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,640
creating a burning so irritating it's

1012
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:30,200
akin to torture that's vaginal shingles

1013
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,000
a non- rashing

1014
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,240
mysterious vaginal

1015
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,359
shingles if a doctor doesn't dismiss it

1016
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,920
as being all in your

1017
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:44,000
head I can't tell you how many times I

1018
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,920
heard that throughout the decades

1019
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,920
doctors dismissing this variety of

1020
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,400
vaginal shingles as being all in the

1021
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,599
woman's

1022
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,800
head because she or he can't find the

1023
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,280
cause she or he will typically

1024
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,040
misdiagnose it once again as a hormonal

1025
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,000
imbalance and prescribe hormones to

1026
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,960
treat it this is not an effective

1027
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,200
treatment and can sometimes make the

1028
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,800
situation work worse many women have

1029
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,319

1030
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,280
vaginal

colitis colitis has always been a

1053
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,800
mystery illness and will continue to be

1054
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,839
so until medical research reveals that

1055
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,280
it's a variety of shingles colitis will

1056
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:23,880
be a mysterious illness for years to

1057
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,000
come unless medical research and science

1058
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,720
says

1059
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,119
uncle

1060
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,480
and

1061
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:34,559
literally chalks it

1062
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,760
up and admits it's a variety of shingles

1063
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,720
the only way they're going to do that is

1064
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,200
if they poach and steal something else

1065
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:43,520
from this book which will be

1066
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,599
this medical research and science

1067
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,520
believe colitis is an autoimmune

1068
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,880
condition where the immune system is

1069
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,880
attacking the lining of the

1070
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,119
[Music]

1071
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,400

so so tired of the

1078
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,800
 medical research and science

1079
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,040
believes colitis is in autoimmune

1080
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,640
condition where the immune system is

1081
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:31,359
attacking the lining of the colon with

1082
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:33,040
no no evidence and no data and no

1083
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,640
studies showing

1084
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,400
it they believe it's just your body

1085
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,720
attacking the inside lining of the colon

1086
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,319
causing inflammation this belief means

1087
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,680
that doctors typically try to treat

1088
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:47,720
Colitis with immunosuppressive drugs

1089
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,400
even worse antibiotics which make the

1090
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,720
virus

1091
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,119
stronger so that personal colitis

1092
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,040
suffers

1093
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,319
more steroids can put put the colitis in

1094
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,839
remission but no one's addressing the

1095
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,920
true nature of it which is the shingles

00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,400
and legs we can do like a total CH

1108
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:44,200
leading dance to that unlike the rash

1109
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:46,119
based strains that attack arm or legs

1110
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,079
with this strain the nerve inflammation

1111
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,359
and Burning Sensations all take place

1112
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,640
far below the skin so you can't pinpoint

1113
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:56,520
or find relief your arms burn your legs

1114
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,000
burn you can have just legs

1115
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,839
sometimes arms but really sometimes it's

1116
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,119
both and you can really suffer with that

1117
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,559
and they'll never know 50 years from now

1118
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,880
they might finally kind of come up with

1119
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:13,119
maybe that was shingles all

1120
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,440
along here's one right here okay mouth

1121
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,200
shingles

1122
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,920
TMJ trinal

1123
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:27,880
neuralgia Bells py Bells py

1124
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,640
okay the only way ever the medical

1125
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,319
industry ever Associated Belle's paly in

1126
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:36,079
any way to viral if it was ever going to

1127
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,400
be shingles would it would have to be a

1128
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,559
rashing

1129
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:45,760
version a rashing version

1130
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,920
okay now the medical industry has taken

1131
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,720
the bell's paly information from medical

1132
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,280
medium book one and now they're using

1133
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,200
it okay this virus affects the gums or

1134
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,200
the area of the jaw different area of

1135
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,839
the jaw gum burning

1136
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,920
gums right it's also responsible for

1137
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,599
Bell's paly viral inflammation of

1138
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,760
critical facial nerves fasal nerves

1139
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,720
trigeminal neuralgia and TMJ disorders a

1140
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,119
result of trigeminal nerve inflammation

1141
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,240
and pain people don't realize I had so

1142
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:17,800
many arguments with people in the health

1143
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,559
movement throughout the years whether

1144
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:24,880
they're like aw TMJ is the mandible

1145
00:48:21,559 --> 00:48:27,880
joint it's not it's it's it's not it's

1146
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,000
when someone's joint is worn out and

1147
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,280
it's not shingles I'd be like really

1148
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,440
because their joint is inflamed that's

1149
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,839
how it wore out their jaw was

1150
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,400
inflamed hence it was in

1151
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:47,040
pain

1152
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,880
before the jaw fell apart on the person

1153
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,119
they suffered in pain they were inflamed

1154
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,599
in the jaw and then 20 years of it their

1155
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,040
joint just started to fall apart yeah

1156
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:01,200
you had to have the shingles there first

1157
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:05,000
the shingles had to be there first and

1158
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,880
then the TMJ the mandible joint stuff

1159
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,880
had to happen

1160
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,680
later it's really frustrating it's

1161
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,559
frequent frequently mistaken for a

1162
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,599
dental issue leading to unnecessary root

1163
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:25,640
canals let's do one more ranal let's do

1164
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:28,920
one more ranal we'll do another ranal oh

1165
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,040
oh crap 10 root canals later we didn't

1166
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,720
know something else is going on in there

1167
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,240
but science of research hasn't figured

1168
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,599
it out Juliet lellan says I think I have

1169
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,680
non- rashing shingles causing TMJ right

1170
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:44,040
jaw pain and pain in my right side of

1171
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,359
the face and ear on and off for a few

1172
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:51,000
years I can't seem to get rid of it and

1173
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:54,520
currently it's worst it's worst post

1174
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,599
dentist okay um all right you guys so I

1175
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,839
was doing that with the Bells py and and

1176
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,799
so

1177
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:01,799
forth Okay frozen

1178
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,160
shoulder who there got the frozen

1179
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,359
shoulder frozen

1180
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,760
shoulder frozen shoulder is brutal for

1181
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:14,880
so many people I've seen people where

1182
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,960
they're so Frozen so Frozen They're

1183
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,040
disabled they're disabled like they're

1184
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,599
they're literally in a

1185
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,720
sling and they they get the massage they

1186
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,559
get the they get work done on it they're

1187
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:29,400
at the doctor every minute frozen

1188
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:34,760
shoulder and it's brutal like it just

1189
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:37,240
seized up viral frozen shoulder shingles

1190
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,079
virus causes causes the frozen shoulder

1191
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,559
it's another thing science research

1192
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,440
actually took from the medical medium

1193
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,680
book The

1194
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,119
Original right there it's where the

1195
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,079
information comes

1196
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,960
from this virus aggravates the nerves in

1197
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,000
the shoulder causing it to freeze up for

1198
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,920
anywhere a month or a year you guys I've

1199
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,079
seen people with frozen shoulder for a

1200
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,720
year they've had it for a year or more

1201
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,440
because the shingles virus was freezing

1202
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,640
their shoulder this condition is often

1203
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,000
misdiagnosed as infectious

1204
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,160
btis oh it's just a case of btis what

1205
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,520
the hell is btis that's not an answer

1206
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:17,000
you can put any name you want on it Wing

1207
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,079
itis veritis whatever you can call it

1208
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,799
whatever you want you know and so the

1209
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,160
thing is is what people don't realize

1210
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:27,000
that's not an answer but shingles the

1211
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:29,920
virus created the

1212
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,640
btis see how it works medical me

1213
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,200
information did this for people that's

1214
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,119
why it was so mindblowing that's why

1215
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,559
it's been a movement all around the

1216
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,880
world I never had to do marketing I

1217
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:42,280
never had to you know hire PR and

1218
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,640
massive marketing firms like everybody's

1219
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,280
doing right now in the health realm

1220
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,559
including people in the medical Med

1221
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,240
community that used to be in the medical

1222
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,760
M community and their influencers and

1223
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,839
they've taken all their followers and

1224
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,960
ran and they're just they're hiring all

1225
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:57,599
these marketing companies helping the

1226
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,720
market everything never did that medical

1227
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,799
medium information no we never did that

1228
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,920
it was just about boom answers people

1229
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:08,240
found it and told someone else that's

1230
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,440
how it was done real answers people

1231
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,200
found it and told somebody some somebody

1232
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,760
else and what happens is that to know

1233
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,640
this right btis isn't an answer but what

1234
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,319
the medical medium information did was

1235
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,160
it said no there is something CA causing

1236
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,640
your

1237
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,200
btis there's something causing your

1238
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,839
frozen shoulder it's a shingles virus

1239
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,680
but more than that protocol for the

1240
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:37,200
shingles virus so you can heal faster or

1241
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,160
heal when people can't heal right all

1242
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,280
right here's one right here I don't like

1243
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:46,000
this shingles I don't like the shingles

1244
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,680
topic I don't like talking about the

1245
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,119
shingles I find it very frustrating in

1246
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:54,319
many ways one is because people have

1247
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:57,960
been tortured to death by shinkles out

1248
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,680
there in their health and throughout

1249
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,280
their struggling and suffering shingles

1250
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,079
has really done a lot of damage to

1251
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,280
people and it breaks my heart so it's

1252
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:08,640
it's a tough one for me it hits the

1253
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,920
emotional Core Body on fire shingles I

1254
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,119
do not like this variety I've seen

1255
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,960
people out there they've gone through

1256
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,839
this this one really really stinks okay

1257
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,480
this virus makes every part of your body

1258
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:27,319
feel like it's on fire like third degree

1259
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,440
burns on fire Sim ously and relentlessly

1260
00:53:27,319 --> 00:53:31,599
it operates by finding a central

1261
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,359
location by the ganglia deep in the

1262
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,319
nervous system and releasing its

1263
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:38,640
neurotoxin this is a variety of shingles

1264
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,319
that gets into that different areas like

1265
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,799
the cranial area and so forth cranial

1266
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,240
nerves which spreads throughout the

1267
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:45,119
whole body and inflames nerves

1268
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:48,079
everywhere needless to say it creates a

1269
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,440
great deal of anxiety and fear and these

1270
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,119
challenging

1271
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,480
emotions can prompt the adrenal glands

1272
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:57,359
to produce an abundant amount of intense

1273
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,799
adrenal

1274
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,920
hormones there's shingles varieties like

1275
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:05,079
this one that creates this problem where

1276
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,280
the the adrenals are flooding like crazy

1277
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:09,000
because the virus inflammation is

1278
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,920
causing so much trouble in the nervous

1279
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,960
system and the nerves are inflamed INF

1280
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:16,079
flared up and the adrenals are just

1281
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,760
exploding with adrenaline and that's

1282
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,440
part of why this thing turns into a fear

1283
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,240
monster there are shingles varieties

1284
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,440
that are this

1285
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:27,440
