[38.64 - 44.64] it's time to get answers welcome to the
[41.72 - 47.76] medical medium podcast I'm Anthony
[44.64 - 50.84] William we're talking about cleansing
[47.76 - 53.64] who's cleansing out there who's really
[50.84 - 56.04] cleansing cuz there's a lot of cleanses
[53.64 - 59.28] that stop you from cleansing that's
[56.04 - 62.40] right cleanse Stoppers it takes a track
[59.28 - 65.96] record it takes people really

[71.12 - 78.48] takes people and their lives being saved
[75.72 - 80.64] then you know they're cleansing it takes
[78.48 - 83.08] the right knoow the information the
[80.64 - 86.56] right tools all of the
[83.08 - 90.16] above in the past the health World knew
[86.56 - 93.76] about toxins but never what kind never
[90.16 - 96.40] had an name to him DDT radiation wasn't
[93.76 - 98.08] on the radar as far as a toxin someone
[96.40 - 101.80] had to worry about that was internally
[98.08 - 103.52] embedded in their organs no nothing else
[101.80 - 106.88] either toxic heavy metals Mercury
[103.52 - 109.88] aluminum lead cadmium arsenic no one
[106.88 - 112.24] worried about that being behind
[109.88 - 114.80] illnesses nobody worried about all the
[112.24 - 117.40] petroleum all the different fragrances
[114.80 - 119.96] all the different poisons and toxins
[117.40 - 122.04] from solvents to everything else nobody
[119.96 - 125.76] talked about that and as far as
[122.04 - 128.92] pathogens went completely off the radar
[125.76 - 132.12] not even the early hygienic movement of
[128.92 - 134.88] Health knew about pathogens in fact they
[132.12 - 137.36] believed bugs did not exist and you
[134.88 - 139.96] should never wash your hands the medical
[137.36 - 143.60] medium information reshaped the health
[139.96 - 146.96] world it's never been the same so much
[143.60 - 149.24] of it has changed because it adopted the
[146.96 - 151.24] medical medium information when the
[149.24 - 155.76] first book met medcal medium hit the
[151.24 - 158.40] scene it changed lives people healed and
[155.76 - 160.84] an organic movement grew and then
[158.40 - 165.72] life-changing foods and then thyroid
[160.84 - 169.20] healing Liver Rescue celery juice and
[165.72 - 171.72] the cleanse the heal book shortly after
[169.20 - 173.88] that the new addition of medical medium
[171.72 - 177.16] and the brainsaver books have changed
[173.88 - 180.64] the world Millions have healed thousands
[177.16 - 184.20] upon thousands countless amounts of
[180.64 - 187.64] testimonials of serious chronic illness
[184.20 - 190.80] serious conditions the books have saved
[187.64 - 193.24] lives all around the world because they
[190.80 - 197.00] work and a big part of those books was
[193.24 - 199.64] the cleansing aspect people were able to
[197.00 - 202.36] cleanse their bodies properly make a
[199.64 - 205.48] difference move the needle and save
[202.36 - 208.76] their lives get ready for some powerful
[205.48 - 211.60] information it's time to
[208.76 - 213.96] heal back years ago it would blow my
[211.60 - 216.08] mind when I would hear somebody in the
[213.96 - 218.32] health realm say you don't need a
[216.08 - 220.44] cleanse you don't need to
[218.32 - 222.92] detox you don't have to worry about
[220.44 - 224.32] poisons and toxins because your body
[222.92 - 227.56] cleanses
[224.32 - 231.44] itself your body does everything it
[227.56 - 235.48] needs to do all on its own when I heard
[231.44 - 239.12] that and still hear it today it blows my
[235.48 - 240.40] mind you don't hear it as much today I
[239.12 - 243.28] think in part
[240.40 - 246.76] just the work that Spirit of compassion
[243.28 - 249.04] medical medium has done along the way
[246.76 - 252.36] with letting people know that you do
[249.04 - 254.68] have to cleanse to heal but you still
[252.36 - 257.20] hear it once in a while your body
[254.68 - 261.32] naturally cleanses and you don't have to
[257.20 - 265.28] do anything for it I don't know anything
[261.32 - 267.48] further from the truth our bodies take
[265.28 - 269.20] on toxins every single day but it's not
[267.48 - 271.00] just that we're born into this world
[269.20 - 273.72] with toxins
[271.00 - 277.76] even toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum
[273.72 - 278.80] cadmium lead arenic just to name a few
[277.76 - 282.64] and then
[278.80 - 285.88] copper that's a big one everybody's high
[282.64 - 288.40] in Copper everybody's copper intoxicated
[285.88 - 290.80] at this point toxic industrialized
[288.40 - 292.52] copper so we have a lot of problems just
[290.80 - 295.52] with toxic heavy metals alone and that's
[292.52 - 298.80] a big one but then there
[295.52 - 301.96] solvents solvents the chemical
[298.80 - 305.28] Industries create that enter our
[301.96 - 309.20] bodies the thing is that we come into
[305.28 - 311.60] this world toxic we automatically do and
[309.20 - 314.16] people still to this day do not realize
[311.60 - 317.88] that we come into this world with our
[314.16 - 321.84] parents pasted in us their past whatever
[317.88 - 323.28] they did drinking any kind of drugs
[321.84 - 326.08] Pharmaceuticals they may have taken
[323.28 - 329.08] along the way any kind of exposures
[326.08 - 332.12] toxic heavy metals Mercury aluminum
[329.08 - 335.84] copper and petroleum products petroleum
[332.12 - 338.00] based products gasoline lubricants
[335.84 - 340.64] different creams and ointments that had
[338.00 - 343.00] lead in there and different chemicals
[340.64 - 345.36] perfumes colog
[343.00 - 348.40] aftershaves things that our parents used
[345.36 - 353.16] from the past all in us when we come
[348.40 - 357.44] here and then there's DDT DDT was around
[353.16 - 363.16] everybody it was everywhere in the past
[357.44 - 366.08] it was the past and it's the present and
[363.16 - 369.20] it's the future unfortunately it's in us
[366.08 - 372.92] all everyone has traces of the dirty
[369.20 - 376.80] past in them and guess what it stays in
[372.92 - 380.12] them it does and it gets passed down to
[376.80 - 381.92] generation to generation and generation
[380.12 - 385.08] these days we have all that plus
[381.92 - 389.00] something new the fragrances a whole new
[385.08 - 391.80] wave of horror a whole new wave of
[389.00 - 394.88] Terror on the body because our body
[391.80 - 398.24] doesn't want thousands and thousands of
[394.88 - 401.96] unknown unidentified chemicals that go
[398.24 - 404.68] under the GU of fragrance in it our
[401.96 - 406.76] bodies don't want that newborn babies
[404.68 - 409.00] today are born with
[406.76 - 411.68] fragrances hundreds and hundreds and
[409.00 - 414.12] hundreds of chemicals that are not even
[411.68 - 417.68] identified no one's taking a blood test
[414.12 - 419.60] and saying whoa there are a thousand
[417.68 - 422.84] chemicals in here a thousand ch
[419.60 - 424.96] chemicals of Unknown Origin the reason
[422.84 - 427.56] why they're not doing that is because
[424.96 - 430.24] nobody knows what they are they don't
[427.56 - 432.84] know what those chemicals are they can
[430.24 - 435.20] only look for toxins they know and a lab
[432.84 - 439.12] will test for all those chemicals and
[435.20 - 442.12] toxins that just reside in us forever
[439.12 - 447.04] it's not like they go away instead more
[442.12 - 450.48] and more come every day every hour every
[447.04 - 454.00] year and our bodies they they have a
[450.48 - 457.04] natural ability to detox yes they do
[454.00 - 461.24] they have a natural ability to eliminate
[457.04 - 463.60] poisons yes they do but what poisons and
[461.24 - 466.24] what toxins because our bodies are
[463.60 - 469.68] designed to eliminate
[466.24 - 473.08] ammonia to eliminate old
[469.68 - 477.72] adrenaline to eliminate other types of
[473.08 - 480.84] blood gases and different toxins normal
[477.72 - 484.20] toxins normal problems that our bodies
[480.84 - 487.40] are supposed to be up against not
[484.20 - 490.00] industrialized Industrial Revolution
[487.40 - 493.28] nightmares as much as we need to
[490.00 - 496.40] exercise for health our well-being for
[493.28 - 500.08] our physical body a great mistake was
[496.40 - 503.16] made in the exercise world the exercise
[500.08 - 505.48] realm the realm of fitness and that
[503.16 - 508.80] mistake was you're detoxing you're
[505.48 - 511.44] sweating everything bad out so what
[508.80 - 513.88] happens people think when they're doing
[511.44 - 516.72] healthy exercising cardio they're
[513.88 - 518.88] running they're jogging they're biking
[516.72 - 521.64] they're skiing or they're just doing
[518.88 - 524.40] lots of cardio workouts or lifting and
[521.64 - 525.84] sweating and sweating and sweating they
[524.40 - 528.76] think they're getting rid of all their
[525.84 - 530.96] toxins they think they're detoxing and
[528.76 - 534.72] then the Shockers come professional
[530.96 - 537.08] athletes getting cancer or getting sick
[534.72 - 539.08] you would think they detoxed everything
[537.08 - 542.44] that could possibly be detoxed out of
[539.08 - 544.76] their body body they're sweating
[542.44 - 547.40] profusely they're sweating every single
[544.76 - 551.00] day they're working out really hard
[547.40 - 555.28] they're building muscles their abs are
[551.00 - 557.84] perfect they are healthy healthy
[555.28 - 560.64] specimens human beings that are in the
[557.84 - 563.08] greatest shape of their lives but then
[560.64 - 566.32] they get cancer or they get some kind of
[563.08 - 568.44] other sickness it doesn't make sense
[566.32 - 570.88] here they are they're cleansing and
[568.44 - 572.84] detoxing their lymphatic system has to
[570.88 - 575.92] be the healthiest lymphatic systems on
[572.84 - 579.68] this planet because blood and lymph it's
[575.92 - 583.08] moving every day the amount of exertion
[579.68 - 585.80] the amount of physical labor in the
[583.08 - 588.88] exercise realm and the professional
[585.80 - 592.76] athletic realm muscles that are laboring
[588.88 - 594.96] every single day and lymphatic systems
[592.76 - 597.56] that are constantly recycling and
[594.96 - 599.12] purifying how is it possible cancer
[597.56 - 601.52] Could Happen how is it possible they
[599.12 - 604.24] could even get sick it's a shocker it
[601.52 - 606.16] doesn't make any sense anybody in that
[604.24 - 608.92] kind of physical shape should be able to
[606.16 - 612.08] live forever live to be at least
[608.92 - 616.52] 105 but yet it doesn't work like that
[612.08 - 620.36] people die people get sick people get
[616.52 - 621.92] diseases literally people fall apart
[620.36 - 624.04] there's so many different athletes out
[621.92 - 627.00] there now that were at the top of their
[624.04 - 631.36] game and could run an unbelievable
[627.00 - 633.20] distance and now there's sick not well
[631.36 - 635.84] they're getting surgeries their body's
[633.20 - 640.36] falling apart and it doesn't make any
[635.84 - 642.92] sense surely all of that sweating all of
[640.36 - 646.12] that exercise all of that increased
[642.92 - 649.12] heart rate all of that lymphatic
[646.12 - 652.52] drainage naturally occurring should have
[649.12 - 655.16] clearly detoxed them clearly set them up
[652.52 - 658.04] for life to be less toxic than anybody
[655.16 - 661.28] else and to be able to like live a good
[658.04 - 663.56] long life without a problem but it
[661.28 - 667.28] didn't no it
[663.56 - 669.52] doesn't because sweating and exercise is
[667.28 - 673.00] critical we need it for all kinds of
[669.52 - 675.80] reasons but it doesn't detox us we can
[673.00 - 678.68] stay just as toxic and collect more
[675.80 - 680.96] toxins and they can stay in us and wreak
[678.68 - 684.68] havoc and cause a lot of problems along
[680.96 - 688.36] the way physical movement physical labor
[684.68 - 690.56] exercise is critical for muscles it's
[688.36 - 693.36] critical for connecting tissue it's
[690.56 - 696.68] critical for joints it's important to
[693.36 - 699.48] exercise even on a gentle basis but it's
[696.68 - 702.76] not the end all be all doesn't work like
[699.48 - 706.72] that you can still be highly toxic and
[702.76 - 709.12] die early or just live a miserable life
[706.72 - 713.96] being chronically sick you can still
[709.12 - 717.00] have pathogens bugs viruses bacteria
[713.96 - 719.52] harboring laying dormant or
[717.00 - 721.76] proliferating in your body while you're
[719.52 - 724.60] an exercise person while you're working
[721.76 - 726.84] out and doing your thing out there and
[724.60 - 728.96] you can still get sick from those bugs
[726.84 - 730.28] keeping you from eventually exercising
[728.96 - 732.92] at all that's why there's a lot of
[730.28 - 734.88] athletes out there that are just stuck
[732.92 - 737.04] severe chronic fatigue syndrome can't
[734.88 - 739.28] even get out of bed because you can't
[737.04 - 742.24] just sweat out those viruses those
[739.28 - 744.60] pathogens the epscene bars the shingles
[742.24 - 748.24] the herpes simplex one two the set
[744.60 - 749.72] megavirus you can't just sweat those out
[748.24 - 751.56] because they're still in the liver
[749.72 - 754.12] they're still in the bloodstream they're
[751.56 - 756.16] still in all the organs they're still in
[754.12 - 758.80] connective tissue they're still in
[756.16 - 760.44] muscles bugs and pathogens don't get
[758.80 - 762.72] sweated out and then they're gone for
[760.44 - 764.96] good and that brings me to something you
[762.72 - 767.32] may hear out there it's like sweat it
[764.96 - 770.72] out when someone has a flu it's like
[767.32 - 773.20] exercise it out run it off sweat it out
[770.72 - 775.08] doesn't work like that either in fact
[773.20 - 777.80] when you're sick with things like
[775.08 - 780.84] pathogens too much exercise runs down
[777.80 - 783.28] the immune system doesn't strengthen the
[780.84 - 786.24] immune system because it takes a strong
[783.28 - 788.44] immune system to exercise to actually
[786.24 - 790.24] work out that's why when somebody's
[788.44 - 792.40] chronically sick they've been
[790.24 - 795.16] chronically ill for a long time and they
[792.40 - 798.60] do a workout maybe a first workout in a
[795.16 - 801.64] long time now they're sick for 3 4 days
[798.60 - 804.12] more or they get an episode where they
[801.64 - 807.00] end up breaking out with some herpes or
[804.12 - 809.88] a rash or some other problem and now
[807.00 - 812.68] they're down and out or
[809.88 - 815.16] they just feel wasted more fatigue more
[812.68 - 817.60] fatigue than they felt in a long time
[815.16 - 820.04] and they're in an episode it's because
[817.60 - 822.44] their immune system is already battling
[820.04 - 825.16] pathogens and probably toxic heavy
[822.44 - 828.36] metals in that moment and their immune
[825.16 - 830.40] systems overloaded or it's weakened and
[828.36 - 832.28] not as strong as it needs to be so then
[830.40 - 834.44] you're working out and you're exercising
[832.28 - 835.80] and you end up tanking so many people
[834.44 - 838.60] with chronic sickness and chronic
[835.80 - 839.76] illness end up tanking after the
[838.60 - 841.92] exercise
[839.76 - 844.72] because their immune system can't do it
[841.92 - 847.12] all it can't handle the recovery of the
[844.72 - 849.20] exercise it can't handle the adrenaline
[847.12 - 852.32] surge of the exercise and it can't
[849.20 - 854.56] handle all the pathogens pathogenic
[852.32 - 856.72] Invaders somebody's up against the
[854.56 - 859.04] reason why they're sick to begin with
[856.72 - 861.96] because in the end what they really need
[859.04 - 864.80] is they need to kill those bugs and
[861.96 - 867.56] cleanse those toxins It's a combination
[864.80 - 869.28] of both killing the bugs and cleansing
[867.56 - 872.28] the toxins
[869.28 - 874.76] whether somebody's an athlete or not the
[872.28 - 877.12] quality of their life determines how
[874.76 - 880.64] many toxins they've collected either
[877.12 - 883.16] entered into this world with or how many
[880.64 - 885.12] bugs they entered this world with or how
[883.16 - 886.40] many toxins and bugs they collected
[885.12 - 889.44] along the way
[886.40 - 891.92] accumulated that determines how healthy
[889.44 - 894.60] someone's going to be now there's other
[891.92 - 898.24] factors around that but those are the
[894.60 - 901.04] two big core factors right there then
[898.24 - 905.36] there's also resour sources there's also
[901.04 - 907.40] upbringing support and love but even if
[905.36 - 909.96] somebody doesn't have the support they
[907.40 - 911.84] don't have the resources they don't have
[909.96 - 914.24] some things they need that other people
[911.84 - 916.44] get if the pathogens and the toxins are
[914.24 - 919.08] really high if they're there causing
[916.44 - 920.76] problems then we're in trouble and then
[919.08 - 923.12] we're struggling and once we're
[920.76 - 925.68] struggling with a chronic illness things
[923.12 - 929.36] get even more difficult because planet
[925.68 - 932.84] Earth is already hard we carry our past
[929.36 - 935.76] with us we carry our baggage with us we
[932.84 - 938.68] all come with baggage it's 10 years 20
[935.76 - 941.12] years 30 years 50 years of garbage
[938.68 - 944.80] that's inside our body inside our liver
[941.12 - 947.00] inside our organs inside our brain it's
[944.80 - 950.28] our brains being dirty and filled with
[947.00 - 952.44] all this baggage it's our heart muscle
[950.28 - 955.24] being filled with this baggage it's our
[952.44 - 958.52] kidneys it's everything inside our body
[955.24 - 959.44] including our bones this baggage is a
[958.52 - 962.20] history
[959.44 - 965.48] of pesticides herbicides fungicides
[962.20 - 966.96] perfumes colog scented candles air
[965.48 - 970.12] fresheners
[966.96 - 972.56] Pharmaceuticals gasoline petrochemicals
[970.12 - 974.56] lubricants aftershaves all kinds of
[972.56 - 977.96] different health and beauty products
[974.56 - 980.92] hair spray hair color everything that's
[977.96 - 983.56] toxic out there in the world that past
[980.92 - 985.68] is with us today and moves to our future
[983.56 - 987.92] if someone's struggling with a mental
[985.68 - 989.68] health condition they're struggling
[987.92 - 992.28] emotionally they're struggling with
[989.68 - 994.44] severe depression anxiety and it's
[992.28 - 996.76] because of toxic heavy metals it's
[994.44 - 999.40] because of mercury and aluminum and
[996.76 - 1001.96] copper inside their brain short
[999.40 - 1006.20] circuiting electrical impulses creating
[1001.96 - 1008.64] OCD creating bipolar creating
[1006.20 - 1011.16] depersonalization it stays with us it's
[1008.64 - 1013.56] moving into the future with us it's the
[1011.16 - 1016.28] past which is the toxic heavy metals
[1013.56 - 1018.64] still in our brains and if we're not
[1016.28 - 1019.60] cleansing these Metals out they stay in
[1018.64 - 1022.44] there
[1019.60 - 1024.48] the past comes with us to the Future
[1022.44 - 1027.28] same thing with anything that's in our
[1024.48 - 1029.40] system like pathogens if we're sick with
[1027.28 - 1031.60] Epstein bar and that Epstein bar is
[1029.40 - 1034.56] giving us thyroid conditions thyroid
[1031.60 - 1037.36] issues Hashimoto or it's just giving us
[1034.56 - 1040.16] fatigue and aches and pains we have that
[1037.36 - 1043.48] bug but unless we get rid of it or knock
[1040.16 - 1045.92] it back or clean it up or cleanse it out
[1043.48 - 1048.36] unless we do that it comes with us in
[1045.92 - 1051.04] the future we take it along with us and
[1048.36 - 1053.40] move into the future with it we take all
[1051.04 - 1056.32] these toxins all these poisons and these
[1053.40 - 1058.68] pathogens and the pathogenic toxins that
[1056.32 - 1062.44] the pathogens create and we take them
[1058.68 - 1065.08] into the future and we live like that we
[1062.44 - 1067.92] have our baggage we have our past we
[1065.08 - 1069.32] bring it into the future so many people
[1067.92 - 1071.84] out there are trying to get rid of their
[1069.32 - 1074.08] past they're burning notes they're
[1071.84 - 1076.04] burning journals they're trying to start
[1074.08 - 1077.64] out fresh they're trying to meet new
[1076.04 - 1080.24] people they're trying to do different
[1077.64 - 1082.00] things gain new interests they're doing
[1080.24 - 1084.12] healthy things they're trying to move
[1082.00 - 1086.60] forward it's all about moving forward
[1084.12 - 1088.60] they're doing yoga they're exercising
[1086.60 - 1091.08] they're trying to better their lives all
[1088.60 - 1094.16] of that is important they are trying to
[1091.08 - 1097.60] move forward they are trying to get past
[1094.16 - 1099.92] their past they want to start fresh but
[1097.60 - 1101.12] unless they're cleaning out the toxins
[1099.92 - 1103.40] and unless they're cleaning out the
[1101.12 - 1106.40] poisons and the toxic heavy metals and
[1103.40 - 1108.80] the pathogens the bugs you're really not
[1106.40 - 1111.16] getting that Fresh Start you're not
[1108.80 - 1113.36] getting that clean slate and that's why
[1111.16 - 1115.76] cleansing is so important the more
[1113.36 - 1119.44] toxins you have deep down in your body
[1115.76 - 1123.12] the more food you have for bugs because
[1119.44 - 1125.76] bugs eat the food they eat the toxins
[1123.12 - 1128.12] that's their food okay so why would that
[1125.76 - 1132.16] be such a big deal well to begin with
[1128.12 - 1135.88] cancer cells those are viral cells those
[1132.16 - 1138.96] are viruses that fed on toxic chemicals
[1135.88 - 1141.72] and toxic waste which eventually CA C
[1138.96 - 1144.08] the viruses to mutate and turn into a
[1141.72 - 1146.16] cancer cell at some point so what
[1144.08 - 1149.76] happens is when we have all these toxins
[1146.16 - 1152.16] in us we have a campground Campground of
[1149.76 - 1154.20] viruses feeding off these toxins and
[1152.16 - 1156.32] then proliferating more eventually
[1154.20 - 1159.08] mutating creating a problem down the
[1156.32 - 1161.68] road which could be cancer cells so we
[1159.08 - 1163.44] have to get rid of these toxins or we
[1161.68 - 1166.16] have to get rid of the viruses we have
[1163.44 - 1168.12] to do one or the other or at least a
[1166.16 - 1170.40] little bit of both and then when it
[1168.12 - 1172.80] comes to auto autoimmune any kind of
[1170.40 - 1174.92] autoimmune diagnosis any kind of
[1172.80 - 1176.48] condition and neurological symptoms
[1174.92 - 1180.00] tightness of the chest tightness of the
[1176.48 - 1182.24] throat aches and pains fatigue headaches
[1180.00 - 1185.92] all the time tingles and numbness
[1182.24 - 1188.48] ringing in the ears vertigo dizziness
[1185.92 - 1191.16] any types of ticks and spasms Tremors
[1188.48 - 1193.16] shakes restless leg syndrome and so many
[1191.16 - 1195.60] more symptoms when it comes down to all
[1193.16 - 1198.88] of those symptoms you're dealing with
[1195.60 - 1202.64] viral issues viruses that are gobbling
[1198.88 - 1204.16] down food toxins that's their food and
[1202.64 - 1206.20] then they're releasing all of these
[1204.16 - 1208.92] neurotoxins somebody could have more
[1206.20 - 1210.76] Mercury than somebody else and then
[1208.92 - 1214.08] their viruses are feeding off of that
[1210.76 - 1217.28] mercury releasing a Mercury based
[1214.08 - 1218.96] neurotoxin and that neurotoxin can make
[1217.28 - 1220.56] life difficult for so many different
[1218.96 - 1223.12] people could give them multiple
[1220.56 - 1226.04] sclerosis symptoms or lime disease
[1223.12 - 1229.00] symptoms or some type of symptom so it's
[1226.04 - 1230.68] important to clean up those toxins it's
[1229.00 - 1233.88] important to clean up those toxic heavy
[1230.68 - 1237.12] metals and knock down those viruses kill
[1233.88 - 1238.72] off those bugs all the different toxins
[1237.12 - 1241.32] and all the different pathogens that
[1238.72 - 1244.12] I've talked about so far don't just jump
[1241.32 - 1246.80] out of the body and disappear they don't
[1244.12 - 1249.48] leave easy they stay with us they live
[1246.80 - 1251.52] in our organs they live in our flesh
[1249.48 - 1254.00] they live in our bowels and they don't
[1251.52 - 1257.36] just go away taking a handful of
[1254.00 - 1259.24] charcoal drinking gallons of milk or
[1257.36 - 1262.04] doing a long-term water water fast or
[1259.24 - 1263.48] juice fast isn't going to get the toxins
[1262.04 - 1266.04] out it isn't going to get the
[1263.48 - 1268.76] petrochemicals out the solvents toxic
[1266.04 - 1271.04] heavy metals or the pathogens they're
[1268.76 - 1273.56] not coming out it's not enough you have
[1271.04 - 1275.68] to do more than that you have to give
[1273.56 - 1277.92] your body what it needs you have to
[1275.68 - 1280.04] learn and know how to cleanse those
[1277.92 - 1282.32] toxins out you have to know how to get
[1280.04 - 1285.24] Metals out you need something that
[1282.32 - 1287.84] actually works that matters all on its
[1285.24 - 1290.04] own then we need something that works
[1287.84 - 1292.00] against the path pens how to kill the
[1290.04 - 1294.40] bugs off how to clean up those
[1292.00 - 1296.56] neurotoxins that the bugs left behind
[1294.40 - 1299.04] and then after that how to restore
[1296.56 - 1301.92] organs how to restore nerves the central
[1299.04 - 1303.72] nervous system how to restore the brain
[1301.92 - 1306.60] after you've gotten rid of all the
[1303.72 - 1309.52] toxins and the pathogens all of this
[1306.60 - 1310.84] combined means everything one thing
[1309.52 - 1313.32] people don't realize in the health
[1310.84 - 1316.44] movement experts or gurus they don't
[1313.32 - 1319.64] realize the emotional and memory toxins
[1316.44 - 1320.80] the cells contain all through adrenaline
[1319.64 - 1323.16] what happens when we go through
[1320.80 - 1325.64] experiences in our life adrenaline is
[1323.16 - 1328.36] involved there's messaging there's
[1325.64 - 1330.44] information within that adrenaline
[1328.36 - 1332.52] there's connections between our brain
[1330.44 - 1334.92] and our adrenals so when we're in fight
[1332.52 - 1338.08] or flight and something happened in our
[1334.92 - 1340.92] life that memory stays in the cells
[1338.08 - 1343.76] stays in the cells through adrenaline
[1340.92 - 1346.60] and adrenaline stays in the cells it
[1343.76 - 1349.56] could sit there for decades long after
[1346.60 - 1351.92] something terrible or something trying
[1349.56 - 1353.88] or a struggle or something difficult or
[1351.92 - 1357.12] some adversity happened in somebody's
[1353.88 - 1360.08] life that adrenaline can sit in cells
[1357.12 - 1361.84] for decades sit inside the liver sit
[1360.08 - 1364.60] inside all the different organs
[1361.84 - 1367.84] including connective tissue and even
[1364.60 - 1369.72] bones and when that adrenaline surfaces
[1367.84 - 1371.96] because you start cleansing for the
[1369.72 - 1375.68] first time in your life you start
[1371.96 - 1379.36] releasing toxins and that adrenaline is
[1375.68 - 1381.52] toxic that adrenaline has those mem
[1379.36 - 1383.40] once it starts to release it starts to
[1381.52 - 1386.44] come out you'll
[1383.40 - 1389.00] experience certain feelings certain
[1386.44 - 1393.40] Sensations even certain memories can
[1389.00 - 1395.48] come up with a dream or in a dream and
[1393.40 - 1397.48] that adrenaline is circulating now
[1395.48 - 1400.16] through the body but it's not going back
[1397.48 - 1403.52] into the body when you properly cleanse
[1400.16 - 1405.68] it goes out of the body and leaves and
[1403.52 - 1408.88] when that toxic adrenaline that old
[1405.68 - 1411.92] adrenaline from years before leaves the
[1408.88 - 1415.20] body you start feeling lighter you start
[1411.92 - 1418.68] feeling more mentally clear because it
[1415.20 - 1421.36] was sitting inside of you for decades
[1418.68 - 1424.48] wreaking havoc creating chaos inside the
[1421.36 - 1427.24] cells of the body and now it's gone if
[1424.48 - 1430.12] you're doing the proper cleansing or
[1427.24 - 1432.40] you're doing a proper cleanse the
[1430.12 - 1435.32] problem with so many cleanses out there
[1432.40 - 1437.32] is they're destructive to the adrenals
[1435.32 - 1439.44] and destructive to the brain because
[1437.32 - 1442.12] they don't offer enough
[1439.44 - 1445.16] calories it's critical to be able to
[1442.12 - 1448.08] offer calories while you're cleansing
[1445.16 - 1451.76] fuel for the brain electrolytes for the
[1448.08 - 1454.04] brain sugar glucose for the brain and
[1451.76 - 1456.40] for the adrenals and that doesn't exist
[1454.04 - 1460.72] in cleanses out there the medical medium
[1456.40 - 1463.40] cleanses it does exist it is there it
[1460.72 - 1466.76] protects the adrenals it creates a
[1463.40 - 1469.12] situation where you can cleanse and heal
[1466.76 - 1471.64] while feeding your body what it need
[1469.12 - 1473.72] while feeding all of your organs what it
[1471.64 - 1478.56] needs and that doesn't happen in
[1473.72 - 1481.32] cleanses cleanses often starve somebody
[1478.56 - 1485.28] of what they need they often either
[1481.32 - 1487.44] starve them or they put a food in that
[1485.28 - 1489.64] cleanse that stops the person from
[1487.44 - 1491.44] cleansing so what I've noticed out there
[1489.64 - 1493.84] all through the years that anytime
[1491.44 - 1495.28] there's a cleanse there's either
[1493.84 - 1497.68] something in the way of the person
[1495.28 - 1499.52] cleansing that's offered in there or
[1497.68 - 1501.48] it's starving them so they're getting
[1499.52 - 1503.40] damage and truly not cleansing what they
[1501.48 - 1505.52] need to cleanse one of the biggest
[1503.40 - 1507.44] problems with cleanses is they don't
[1505.52 - 1509.08] know what they're trying to cleanse out
[1507.44 - 1511.84] up until recently with the medical
[1509.08 - 1514.08] medium books educating people on what's
[1511.84 - 1516.36] really in them the toxic heavy metals
[1514.08 - 1518.68] and all the different poisons and the
[1516.36 - 1520.68] Pharmaceuticals and all the pathogens
[1518.68 - 1523.04] until that happened till that
[1520.68 - 1525.08] information truly got out there no one
[1523.04 - 1528.52] knew what they were cleansing it was
[1525.08 - 1531.56] just toxins that was it not what were
[1528.52 - 1533.84] the toxins not what else is happening
[1531.56 - 1536.64] just toxins so the cleanses were
[1533.84 - 1540.96] designed for Hit or Miss weak grass
[1536.64 - 1544.04] juice lots of water but all guessing
[1540.96 - 1545.44] games that's what the cleanses were but
[1544.04 - 1547.80] when it comes down to Cleansing you
[1545.44 - 1550.28] can't do the guessing game thing there
[1547.80 - 1553.48] can't be any games at all it has to be
[1550.28 - 1555.88] what works how do you cleanse how do you
[1553.48 - 1558.72] heal what kind of toxins are actually in
[1555.88 - 1561.12] the body what are they are they metals
[1558.72 - 1563.24] how do we get those Metals out they just
[1561.12 - 1565.64] don't cleanse out you need a way to
[1563.24 - 1568.72] extract them out and what about all the
[1565.64 - 1571.16] other toxins and then set that aside
[1568.72 - 1573.28] what about the pathogens because in the
[1571.16 - 1575.56] health movement nobody knew pathogens
[1573.28 - 1577.88] were responsible for all the different
[1575.56 - 1580.32] autoimmune the conditions the symptoms
[1577.88 - 1582.20] the diseases and so forth nobody knew
[1580.32 - 1584.48] that it's medical medium information all
[1582.20 - 1587.20] these years that pathogens cause
[1584.48 - 1590.32] neurological problems and symptoms so
[1587.20 - 1592.04] all the cleanses were already obsolete
[1590.32 - 1594.36] or didn't work at all because they
[1592.04 - 1596.72] didn't even know that viruses and
[1594.36 - 1599.84] bacteria were responsible for so many of
[1596.72 - 1601.80] the different ailments so it was all hey
[1599.84 - 1604.40] you got candida let's do a candida
[1601.80 - 1606.80] cleanse but a candida cleanse would tear
[1604.40 - 1608.64] somebody's guts up it would cause a
[1606.80 - 1610.36] problem it wouldn't be good for the
[1608.64 - 1613.12] person at all and it would starve them
[1610.36 - 1614.96] of glucose for the brain and then
[1613.12 - 1617.64] there'd be like a sodium bicarbonate
[1614.96 - 1619.92] cleanse which would destroy any good
[1617.64 - 1622.08] bacteria in their intestinal tract and
[1619.92 - 1624.28] wreak havoc on their intestinal lining
[1622.08 - 1626.96] and create immune system problems and
[1624.28 - 1630.04] then it'd be a milk cleanse but a milk
[1626.96 - 1633.64] cleanse just feeds all pathogens it
[1630.04 - 1635.88] emboldens a pathogen it proliferates a
[1633.64 - 1638.08] virus creating a problem that if
[1635.88 - 1640.24] somebody was chronically ill with any
[1638.08 - 1642.48] kind of neurological problems because of
[1640.24 - 1645.00] pathogens the milk cleanse would make
[1642.48 - 1648.40] that so much worse and then the water
[1645.00 - 1652.56] fasts water fasting which atrophies the
[1648.40 - 1654.36] brain it shrinks somebody's brain any
[1652.56 - 1655.68] kind of glycogen storage that somebody
[1654.36 - 1658.04] has in their brain when they do a
[1655.68 - 1660.84] long-term water fast and they don't have
[1658.04 - 1663.84] glycogen going in glucose going in for a
[1660.84 - 1666.92] long time what happens is the brain
[1663.84 - 1669.16] atrophies and then longterm juice
[1666.92 - 1671.84] cleanses without the celery juice
[1669.16 - 1674.36] without the sodium the celery juice
[1671.84 - 1676.88] longterm juice fasts would shrink
[1674.36 - 1678.44] stomachs create an elasticity problem in
[1676.88 - 1680.80] the intestinal tracts from no
[1678.44 - 1683.12] peristaltic action and then the
[1680.80 - 1685.04] dangerous parasite cleanses the ones
[1683.12 - 1688.04] that rip the intestinal tracts apart
[1685.04 - 1691.32] with Clays using so many different
[1688.04 - 1692.88] scratchy scratchy products these gut
[1691.32 - 1694.88] health cleanses would irritate the
[1692.88 - 1697.00] Linings of the intestinal track and the
[1694.88 - 1699.44] colon creating a whole bunch of problems
[1697.00 - 1701.92] for people and then there were the fruit
[1699.44 - 1704.48] fear cleanses that no fruit allowed on
[1701.92 - 1707.28] any level so it would just be like
[1704.48 - 1709.68] sprouts and wheat grass juice and
[1707.28 - 1713.20] nothing else where the person is being
[1709.68 - 1715.12] starved of calories caloric action
[1713.20 - 1717.56] starved of glucose for their organs
[1715.12 - 1719.68] their muscles and their brains and then
[1717.56 - 1721.52] they would atrophy in their muscles from
[1719.68 - 1724.80] not getting enough glucose and they
[1721.52 - 1726.84] would just be on wheat grass and Sprouts
[1724.80 - 1729.72] then there was the long-term dry fasting
[1726.84 - 1732.56] cleanses which is disastrous for
[1729.72 - 1734.52] multitude of reasons and then there were
[1732.56 - 1737.16] the autoimmune cleanses which are still
[1734.52 - 1739.36] out there now in some shape or form and
[1737.16 - 1741.52] the autoimmune cleanses have so much fat
[1739.36 - 1744.16] in them so much over it fat that it's
[1741.52 - 1746.24] impossible to cleanse anything therefore
[1744.16 - 1748.32] nothing cleanses on an autoimmune
[1746.24 - 1750.80] cleanse and what about other cleanses
[1748.32 - 1753.04] that are high in fat which means no
[1750.80 - 1755.64] cleansing happens with those either
[1753.04 - 1758.52] there are dozens and dozens of cleanses
[1755.64 - 1761.04] out there that have overt fat in it
[1758.52 - 1762.92] which means the liver won't cleanse a
[1761.04 - 1765.84] huge mistake in the cleansing world that
[1762.92 - 1768.68] nobody knew which is you can't cleanse
[1765.84 - 1771.96] any toxins or poisons out meaning deep
[1768.68 - 1774.84] seeded ones and deep seeded Metals if
[1771.96 - 1777.56] the high fat content in the bloodstream
[1774.84 - 1780.64] is too high if the over fats are too
[1777.56 - 1783.80] high some fat could be okay depending
[1780.64 - 1787.00] but a lot of cleanses have a lot of MCT
[1783.80 - 1789.52] oil they have a lot of other oils or
[1787.00 - 1791.44] olive oil another cleanse out there
[1789.52 - 1793.64] that's popular is drinking straight
[1791.44 - 1796.80] olive oil as if that's going to cleanse
[1793.64 - 1799.40] a person all that does is throw the
[1796.80 - 1801.36] liver into chaotic shock and doesn't
[1799.40 - 1803.64] cleanse it shuts down the liver
[1801.36 - 1806.52] temporarily not allowing it to release
[1803.64 - 1809.28] any toxins or poisons I can do this all
[1806.52 - 1811.08] day but there is a right way to cleanse
[1809.28 - 1814.00] and it's not just coming from a place
[1811.08 - 1816.24] where I just started a cleanse of some
[1814.00 - 1818.36] kind I'm excited about it and I want you
[1816.24 - 1820.76] to know about it and give it a shot

[1834.36 - 1838.68] of healing the ones that have turned
[1836.52 - 1840.64] people's lives around the ones that
[1838.68 - 1843.60] actually worked and got rid of the
[1840.64 - 1845.56] toxins and poisons lowered their weight
