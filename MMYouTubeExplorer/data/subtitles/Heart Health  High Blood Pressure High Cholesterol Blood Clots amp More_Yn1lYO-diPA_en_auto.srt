it where they don't know how to navigate

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
out of things like butter they they

264
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,399
so you know where did

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,200
where did these things kind of come in

267
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
like eggs like heart healthy stamps on

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
eggs

269
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
that's a tricky one right there it's

270
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
like heart-healthy stamps that are on

271
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800

right and you know so what happens is

274
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
we're totally in the realm of eating

275
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
foods to

276
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
possibly

277
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
cuddle our condition to get our heart

278
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,640
attack down the road well that's what's

279
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
really you know that's what's really

280
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
crazy out there how it works so let's go

281
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,000
into it of how what happens with the

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,240
heart how does that work so here's the

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
deal

284
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
your heart

285
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
okay

286
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,440
right

287
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
is a muscle machine

288
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,640
right

289
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,480
its job though is to pump your blood

290
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
we know that

291
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
but there's something we don't know

292
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
it's not supposed to pump

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,360
blood

294
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,800
really high in fat

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,079
yes

296
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,200
it's not supposed to pump blood

297
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,200
really high in fat

298
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,079
that's what it's not supposed to do

299
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,959
because what happens is your liver

300
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,480
starts to become a fatty liver because

301
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,519
of butter

302
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
eggs

303
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
pork

304
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,720
all of that and

305
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,720
your liver starts to become a fatty

306
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,399
liver so here's what happens your

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:37,839
heart's job is to pump blood

308
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,560
out of your liver

309
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,760
your liver is a filter

310
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,279
okay

311
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,360
i don't know what kind of system you got

312
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,399
do you have an air filter system and

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,680
your

314
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,680
hot water heater system your oil burner

315
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,519
maybe maybe your apartment building has

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,600
a big old oil burner down the basement

317
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,680
nobody knows about and there's a filter

318
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,240
on there and the filter gets dirty

319
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,560
your air conditioning has a filter on it

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,640
there's filters on everything

321
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,040
so when the fan is pumping it's sucking

322
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,360
air through the filter and as the filter

323
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,720
gets clogged you can go and change the

324
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,360
filter you can be like you know what

325
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,880
i can go change the filter

326
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,120
you can't change your liver you can't go

327
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,360
you can't change your liver your liver

328
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,279
is the filter your liver is the filter

329
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,440
you can't go and just say i'm just gonna

330
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,959
go change the filter out of my liver i'm

331
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,320
just gonna go change the filter out of

332
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,600
it of course you're doing medical medium

333
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
stuff and you're cleaning your liver and

334
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
you're cleansing all that you can do

335
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,959
that

336
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,959
but

337
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
what happens is that filter starts

338
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,800
getting clogged up with fat

339
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,440
too much dairy

340
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
milk cheese butter

341
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,920
eggs

342
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,639
more cheese

343
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
vegan cheese

344
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
regular cheese

345
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,279
nuts seeds right and it's okay if you

346
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,639
want to have a little bit of nuts you

347
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,000
want to have a little bit of seeds and

348
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,079
nut butters you might have some coconut

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,440
oil you want some olive oil

350
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:10,560
but it starts to get tired the liver

351
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,279
gets tired all the fat starts to bog

352
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,360
down the liver and the liver then

353
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
starts to get tired starts to get

354
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
clogged

355
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,240
and then

356
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
the heart

357
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
has to now

358
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
work harder

359
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,360
a hard job

360
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
is to pump the blood

361
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
from the liver

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
if your liver is clean and there's not a

363
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,360
lot of fat in the liver

364
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
your blood can pump easy

365
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,360
you know easier

366
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,160
to the to the heart so the heart's job

367
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,079
is to pull the blood from the liver

368
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
up to it

369
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
right

370
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,000
but then we

371
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:57,040
make our blood so thick

372
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,560
like a thick milkshake

373
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,279
we turn our blood into a thick milkshake

374
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,880
our blood is dehydrated

375
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,120
it's thick

376
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,000
it becomes congested

377
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,880

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
that in the medical medium books right

379
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
the blood becomes congested or blood

okay

384
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,120
and then the heart gets tired

385
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,000
years go by

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,160

doing

407
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
cardiovascular work and what happens is

408
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,199
that the heart

409
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,639
it gets tired as the years go by and the

410
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,839
years go by

411
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
so the heart

412
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,920
it has this limitation on it it's not

413
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,639
just clogged arteries and clogged veins

414
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,360
and clogged valves

415
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,120
it's not just clogged ventricles

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,040
it's not just clogged ventricles it's

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,880
not just clogged arteries it's not just

418
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,920
clogged valves right

419
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,440

high fat high protein

434
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,079
yeah it bogs the heart down

435
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
i'm not saying you can't if you're an

436
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,880
animal protein person i'm not saying you

437
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
can't have a piece of chicken you can't

438
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
have a piece of grass-fed beef i'm not

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
saying you can't have

440
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
you know

441
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,519
a piece of fish

442
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,040
but we overdo it if you're a vegan and

443
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,800
plant-based i'm not saying you can't

444
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
have walnuts

445
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,279
i got some walnuts in the cupboard over

446
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
here

447
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,519
i'm not saying you can't have some

448
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,920
walnuts

449
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,320
you can't have some nut butter right

450
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,079
but we overdo it and we over do it and

451
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,519
sometimes when we need to do clean up

452
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,639
and clean that filter and clean that

453
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,320
liver filter up we can't clean it up

454
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,759
because we're running so much fat

455
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,680
through there

456
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
we're running so much fat through there

457
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,000
okay

458
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
and then

459
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,959
we get too many poisons built up inside

460
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,240
our liver and too many poisons built up

461
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,720
inside

462
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,480
our organs and then we get the viral

463
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,880
issues and then all of a sudden we got

464
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,199
the viral issues right

465
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,399
the viral issues

466
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,920
and then we're sick we get the

467
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,680
fibromyalgia the chronic fatigue

468
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,759
syndrome the aches and pains the

469
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,360
dizziness the vertigo we get the tingles

470
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,360
and numbness we get the we get the um

471
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,279
brain fog

472
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,120
we get all these different things right

473
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,440
we get the eye floaters we get the you

474
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,040
know we get the the vertigo like i said

475
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,920
we get all of that

476
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,639
trigeminal neuralgia neck pain back pain

477
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,079
ear pain jaw pain right knee pain our

478
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
knees start blowing out everything

479
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,880
starts blowing out we start going

480
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
downhill

481
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,880
because we get all that viral

482
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,480
inflammation in there too

483
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,519
but one thing's for certain

484
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
right now

485
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,360
we're accelerating into

486
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,880
heart attacks

487
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,320
blood clots

488
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,480
strokes

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,360
clogged arteries

490
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,920
heart problems

491
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
we're in a place where heart failure

492
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,079
we're in a place where that's

493
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,680
more so than ever before in our history

494
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,519
and it's only getting worse and worse

495
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,519
and worse so let's talk about this for a

496
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,039
little bit

497
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,039
so when you eat a stick of butter

498
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,760
it goes into your bloodstream

499
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,039
a hunk of that butter goes into your

500
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
bloodstream

501
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,160
now

502
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,360
if you like grass-fed butter don't get

503
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,079
mad

504
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,439
i i i'm gonna say that you know what

505
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,919
if you eat

506
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,839
a block of vegan cheese

507
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,760
i'm gonna say the same thing

508
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
a block of vegan cheese

509
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
the difference is with butter it feeds

510
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
bugs and that's another story we're on

511
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,919
cardiovascular

512
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,000
but you know feeding bugs is another

513
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,280
story butter does feed all the pathogens

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,280
right when you eat a stick of butter

515
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,039
okay you guys see this

516
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,120
tik tok you can't surprise see it tell

517
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,000
her eat a stick of butter and that

518
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
butter goes down into the stomach

519
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,440
right now that butter's in the stomach

520
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
right here

521
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
okay

522
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,880
then that butter

523
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
goes into the to the duodenum

524
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
and then

525
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,679
that butter starts to get dispersed by

526
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,600
your bile from your liver

527
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,960
and as your bile is breaking down

528
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,280
the butter

529
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,919
fat

530
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,320
okay dissolving it

531
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,960
it's now getting dispersed and going up

532
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,200
your veins

533
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,919
now it's going up to veins that are

534
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,600
attached to your duodenum and your small

535
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
intestinal tract

536
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,039
those veins

537
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,039
are sucking the butter up

538
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,840
and who's doing all the work

539
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,919
your heart

540
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
your heart you guys on tick tock

541
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,400
that's who's doing all the work on

542
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,280
telegram your heart

543
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,039
okay

544
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,080
so now your heart's

545
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,240
trying to suck the butter

546
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,559
up through your hepatic portal highway

547
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,840
which is your veins

548
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,919
attached to your small intestinal tract

549
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,960
and your heart's trying to pull that

550
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,080
butter

551
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,720
up through that intestinal tract

552
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
and up the veins

553
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,840
into your liver

554
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,640
so now the stick of butter

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
is in your liver

556
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
okay

557
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,039
as the years go by

558
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,200
butter gets trapped in that liver

559
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,880
now you don't know it even if you didn't

560
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,400
get a diagnosis you got a fatty liver

561
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,919
and then

562
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
okay

563
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,960
your heart

564
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,400

so the point is is where i'm going with

666
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,559
all of this right

667
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
so what people don't realize is that

668
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,280
their heart is doing double time

669
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,280
and heart health is really being

670
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,480
cautious to how much

671
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,480
grease

672
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,400
whatever we're greasing our wheels with

673
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,400
goes in our body if that's butter if

674
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,760
that's anything else april tap says my

675
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
parents keep saying their high blood

676
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,559
pressure is hereditary they won't listen

677
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,559
to me to the true cause

678
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,039
anyone can get rid of their mystery high

679
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,880
blood pressure anyone can get rid of

680
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,120
their mystery hot blood blood that is

681
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
one thing you can get rid of you do the

682
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,880
right things you can get rid of mystery

683
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,760
of high blood pressure i can't tell you

684
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
how many people i've talked to were able

685
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,880
to just get rid of their high blood

686
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,880
pressure and it's gone boom it's gone

687
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,279
like gone that's it

688
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,840
and my grandmother fed me sticks of

689
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:05,120
butter as a baby oh avis

690
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,080
right and that's what causes the

691
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
fluctuating high blood pressure right

692
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,559
it's a liver

693
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
that's getting too much fat stored up in

694
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,640
it

695
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,200
and a heart

696
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,640
that's trying to regulate

697
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,039
so it's a heart that's trying to

698
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,120
regulate so fluctuating fluctuating

699
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
mysterious high blood pressure

700
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,640
even if it's like for one month and then

701
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,159
one month it's off one month it's on

702
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,559
three months it's on three months it's

703
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,080
off it's on it's off right it's

704
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,760
fluctuating right sunrood says love your

705
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,279
live shows i'm so honored you're here

706
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,720
truly okay

707
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:44,240
that fluctuating blood pressure

708
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,600
is the heart trying to regulate

709
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
it's the heart trying to regulate so

710
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,159
it's the vagus nerves

711
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,240
it's messages coming from your brain

712
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,080
sending them down your brain stem

713
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,000
sending them down the vagus nerves

714
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,080
sending them to the heart

715
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,320
and and trying to help the heart

716
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,960
regulate why the heart is trying to

717
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,960
struggle if the heart is actually trying

718
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,960
to to regulate with your vagus nerves

719
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,799
there's so much fat in the bloodstream

720
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,840
and fat inside the liver every single

721
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,440
day that the gas has to be put on so you

722
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,919
get these messages from the brain so

723
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,200
what happens is

724
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,840
you get messages from the brain

725
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,360
going down the vagus nerves heading to

726
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,440
your heart

727
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,919
telling your heart put on the brakes

728
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,840
step on the gas put on the brakes step

729
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,360
on the gas put on the brakes step on the

730
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,640
gas put on the brakes that's what's

731
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
happening

732
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
because the liver is clogged and getting

733
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,320
clogged every day with a fatty liver

734
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,000
because of so much of that butter and so

735
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,440
much of that grease and so much of those

736
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
nut butters too

737
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,120
nut butters

738
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah too much nut butters this is

739
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,120
medical medium information just letting

740
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,799
everybody know

741
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,559

745
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,559

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,600
let's talk about strokes

752
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,480
okay

753
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,919
strokes happen for a couple of reasons

754
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,880
one is

755
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,080
the veins in the arteries the tiny

756
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,919
arteries

757
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,279
tiny arteries see that see the arteries

758
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,240
right there

759
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,559
blood vessels and small arteries see all

760
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
the small arteries right

761
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,880
they start getting

762
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,840
clogged up

763
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,000
they start narrowing everything starts

764
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,240
to narrow okay

765
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,400
but that doesn't mean you're gonna get a

766
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,320
stroke ever you can

767
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,559
live your life without a stroke

768
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,080
and you can have narrowing in all the

769
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,000
arteries and all the little tiny

770
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,760
arteries right in blood vessels you can

771
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,520
have those you could have those but

772
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,240
here's what does the stroke

773
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,240
invaders

774
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,559
invaders right here

775
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,760
clusters of viruses clusters of

776
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,360
pathogens

777
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,080
clusters of pathogens viruses and toxins

778
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,200
clusters of these

779
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,159
they have to find their way through

780
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,080
all the narrowed arteries

781
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,919
viruses tend to

782
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,440
become cluster clumps

783
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,840
cluster

784
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,679
beep

785
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,120
bleep that's what they become cluster

786
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,159
bleeps

787
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,159
what happened is

788
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,320
your white blood cells

789
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,120
okay

790
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,679
want to kill the viruses

791
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,559
so they jump on the viruses

792
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,520
to try to stop the viruses

793
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,360
but if you got too many narrowings

794
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,600
in all the different blood vessels

795
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,679
too many narrowings

796
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,320
what happens is when the your immune

797
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,640
system tries to do its job and jump on

798
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,120
the virus

799
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
it clumps up and then you got like a big

800
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,679
clump

801
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,399
of bugs and viruses and everything right

802
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,880
and immune cells everything's just

803
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,200
battling each other and that clump

804
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,919
just starts to get bigger and bigger and

805
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,960
that clump is now traveling through

806
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,720
narrowed passageways and then it gets to

807
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,640
the brain

808
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,760
when it gets to the brain

809
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:40,000
when that cluster of pathogens and

810
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,000
immune cells get to the brain

811
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,360
everything starts to get smaller and

812
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,399
smaller but the clump is bigger and

813
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,880
bigger

814
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,640
finally it blocks

815
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,640
a blood vessel completely

816
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
but it wouldn't have happened

817
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,039
if

818
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
your whole life you didn't have your

819
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,360
bloodstream filled with a ton of fat

820
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,279
your liver filled the fat

821
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,880
and the arteries filled with fat this is

822
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
advanced medical medium information if

823
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
you heard it here you heard it here

824
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,480
first

825
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,840
just so you know smokey mountain smoking

826
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,840
mountain paradise good to see you guys

827
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,600
so

828
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,320
what happens is that we can do something

829
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,440
about it right we can protect ourselves

830
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,640
okay

831
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,880
so

832
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,399
right now people are overloaded with

833
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
toxins

834
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,080
and

835
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,080
toxins

836
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,520
also when they're really foreign toxins

837
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,840
demand

838
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,679
your immune cells to jump on those too

839
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,120
right now people are getting foreign

840
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,039
toxins

841
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,200
lots of them

842
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,679
and the foreign toxins from everywhere

843
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
all places air fresheners scented

844
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,360
candles

845
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,399
just everywhere to pharmaceuticals like

846
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,799
everywhere just people are getting

847
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,559
foreign toxins through everything the

848
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,000
antibiotics there's foreign toxins in

849
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,880
that there's 40 foreign toxins in

850
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,279
everything right so all this stuff

851
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,039
right centicams clones perfumes

852
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,200
laundry detergents fabric softeners

853
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,760
cleaning supplies like all this stuff

854
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,520
foreign foreign toxins and and your

855
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,120
immune cells have to eat up those

856
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,960
foreign toxins so when you have a

857
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,760
foreign toxin so let's get some toxins

858
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,880
see if we can find some of that right

859
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,399
when you get some foreign toxins okay

860
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,760
let's say you're doing some fish oil

861
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,480
so there's mercury in fish oil

862
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,399
so

863
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,919
that's a foreign toxin so say you're

864
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,159
taking your fish oil every day and you

865
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,840
think you're helping yourself

866
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,840
here's your fish oil right

867
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,640
the mercury in there

868
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,480
gets eaten up by your immune system so

869
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,840
your white blood cells are trying to eat

870
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,520
up that mercury to protect you

871
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,159
okay and when it when it's eating up all

872
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
these forward toxins constantly

873
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,720
constantly

874
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,159
it can clump it can cluster around all

875
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,120
the toxins

876
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,760
and that cluster can find a narrowing

877
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,440
somewhere in the brain or brain stem

878
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,279
anywhere it could find a narrowing

879
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,279
anywhere and that's where we get in

880
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,600
trouble right there

881
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,679
and then boom we've got a stroke

882
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,559
there's no evidence whatsoever to back

883
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,919
up

884
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,760
in any medical literature

885
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,240
or studies

886
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,000
yeah i mean there's no evidence to back

887
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,240
up what there's no evidence to back up

888
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,799
this information

889
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,200
because you heard it from here first

890
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,559
and then science takes it later i mean

891
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,480
like they always do with medical mean

892
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,200
information look if you're if you're

893
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,279
here to really learn something i'll just

894
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,440
fill you in right now okay medical

895
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,799
medium information is the first

896
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,880
to bring epstein-barr causing

897
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,760
hashimoto's thyroiditis ra and

898
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,159
fibromyalgia right advanced information

899
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,159
science took it after the fact it was

900
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
published by medical medium medical

901
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,159
medium also

902
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,760
brought reactivated epstein-barr being

903
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,399
long plagued so the long plant the long

904
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,720
plague the long-haul plague right

905
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,360
so the long-haul plague now doctors are

906
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,799
saying it's reactivated epstein-barr

907
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,720
that was medical medium information

908
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,640
public for published first

909
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
the long-haul pandemic

910
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,919
so you might be sitting here saying

911
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,600
there's no substantiation behind your

912
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,279
stuff then tell science research to stop

913
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,840
taking all my stuff

914
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,919
dude call up science and research and

915
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,679
tell them to stop poaching all of

916
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
medical medium stuff

917
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,960
okay why don't you do that for me once

918
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
you go somewhere else

919
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,640
i'd like you here though once you go

920
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,200
somewhere else and tell them to stop

921
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,039
taking medical medium information please

922
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,440
or cite it

923
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,519
back to where it originates

924
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,360
right so that's just a couple of things

925
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,320
i've been going on all day about that

926
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,559
right

927
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,919
okay this is funny

928
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,919
medical medium

929
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,919
right talks about celery juice does for

930
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,600
everybody and now

931
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,679
all of a sudden

932
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,559
it's being picked up

933
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
by some of the biggest like industries

934
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,240
in the world now and they're all gonna

935
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,039
be putting out celery juice

936
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,220
right

937
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,360
i guess uh

938
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,960
[Music]

939
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,159
what does that tell you right there and

940
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,440
they're gonna be spouting out all its

941
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,960
benefits

942
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,080
much of what medical medium put out

943
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120

mean i'm eating cow

976
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,399
what are you talking about that's crazy

977
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,599
i'm not eating cow

978
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,119

979
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,159
don't you have a grasp of beef he's like

980
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,839

i said you're eating cow

982
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,280
how's it going because i'm not eating

983
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,440
cow

984
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,839
i said you're eating cow

985
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,399
anyway the point is if you're eating cow

986
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,280
lower the amount of cow you're eating

987
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,919
right

988
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,919
lower the amount

989
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,440
if you're eating nut butters lower the

990
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,760
amount of nut butters if you're eating

991
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,320
avocado bring them down a little bit

992
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
don't do three avocados every single day

993
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
somebody could be doing two avocados and

994
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
they have chicken and they have coconut

995
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,240
oil and they have you know what i mean

996
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,720
give the body a break that's what i'm

997
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,400
talking about so the whole point is is

998
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,720
give your body a break learn how to

999
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,240
bring it down a little bit

1000
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,200
cold white spring says some people don't

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,880
even know that meat is muscle

1002
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,079
some people

1003
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,400
how about almost everybody

1004
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,400

1005
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,040
almost everybody so when it comes down

1006
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,200

1007
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,640
okay keep in mind

1008
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,800
and i love it when somebody says there's

1009
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,520
no substantiated evidence to back this

1010
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,839
up

1011
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,440
three years later where'd the person go

1012
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,680

how much

1029
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,359
should dogs so okay it's a question nika

1030
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:23,680
yeah should dogs eat meat every day

1031
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,320
dogs should not be vegan

1032
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
a dog's intestinal tract is this long

1033
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,599
let me show you okay

1034
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,560
so

1035
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,640
so dogs should not be eat dogs should

1036
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,800
not be vegan they should get some fruits

1037
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,280
and vegetables dogs should get wild

1038
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
foods fruits and vegetables they should

1039
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,359
but that's a dog's intestinal tract

1040
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
right there

1041
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,960
okay

1042
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,200
that's a human's intestinal tract right

1043
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,200
there

1044
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,480
that's a dog's intestinal tract

1045
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
basically right there i mean not not

1046
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,320
totally it's more than this but

1047
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,880
basically that's what it is

1048
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,800
and so yeah dogs are dogs are carnivore

1049
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,160
but i'm not anti-animal protein medical

1050
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,599
medium information supports animal

1051
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,200
protein eaters because you can still

1052
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,200
heal on medical medium information while

1053
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,800
eating animal protein and you can still

1054
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,160
eat you can still be vegan and

1055
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,440
plant-based and you know some people

1056
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,480
think of anti-plant-based anti-vegan

1057
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,320
because they're confused because they

1058
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
don't understand i never took a side of

1059
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,839
an aisle they're wondering why how come

1060
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,119

1061
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,079

1062
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,000
