00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,800
about today and I am pumped up and I am

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,640
excited and I'm going to cover what

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,320
happens to our skin in general you can't

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,960
fix the skin from the outside we can try

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,800
all we want we can try our hardest we

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,440
can do everything we can slather all

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,399
kinds of stuff on our bodies we can be

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,480
slathering all kinds of essential oils

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,160
we can get ourselves soaking wet with

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,680
oil and everything and hop in bed at

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,760
night we can do a seaweed wrap with oil

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,039
all over us hop in bed at night wake up

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,239
in the morning and do it again the next

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
day we can put whatever we want on the

24
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,320
surface of our skin it's not going to be

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,040
enough it's not going to fix the

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,520
elasticity problem that people get this

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,560
is important your skin is the whole

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,000
organ that's the big old organ right

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,479
that's your organ if you hurt a part of

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,200
your stomach a little part of it the

31
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,079
entire stomach gets affected if you hurt

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,400
a little part of your liver the entire

33
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:31,520
liver gets affected if you hurt a little

34
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:35,840
part of your skin the entire organ gets

35
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,520
affected by it it compromises the entire

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,600
organ your skin and so it's critical to

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,640
be doing the right stuff it's critical

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,560
to build up that collagen From the

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,920
Inside Out heal up the skin from the

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,399
inside out not from the outside in I

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
know so many of us is always like

42
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,799
outside in outside in outside in really

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
it's inside out that's the key it's all

44
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,240
about immune power it's all about immune

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,600
system our immune system patrols that

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:12,040
area and right under the Derma right

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,519
under the skin our immune system needs

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,040
antioxidants in that area antioxidants

49
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,200
are one of the critical

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,319
Builders right there silica one of the

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,280
critical Builders stopping oxidative

52
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,640
stress because oxidative stress lands in

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,720
the Deep depths of the skin it winds up

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,800
trying to find itself escaping through

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,319
your skin when you're under stress and

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,239
you're going through all this stuff

57
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,840
emotionally mentally our immune system

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,879
drops all that adrenaline's coarsing

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,599
through our veins leaking up through the

60
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,319
skin that's why we have a bad skin

61
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
looking day when we've been through hell

62
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,519
and back with stress when you're under

63
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,480
stress all those free radicals are

64
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,879
pouring through your system along with

65
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,760
that adrenaline emotional challenges

66
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,920
what's happening is the bottom of your

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,840
your Derma right underneath there is

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,840
starting to soak it all up it's soaking

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,799
up the adrenaline and as it soaks up the

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,799
adrenaline it tries to rid it as quick

71
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,080
as it can so the bottom of your Derma

72
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,480
right here right where your skin even

73
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,519
starts and even before it starts right

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,400
before that deep layer even

75
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,799
starts that area right there acts as a

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,159
sponge it sponges up all the adrenaline

77
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,599
from flight uh fight ORF flight right

78
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,959
here all the adrenaline from any kind of

79
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,760
emotional stress

80
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,879
whatsoever it sponges it up what are we

81
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,120
doing to protect the skin because that's

82
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,000
how our skin ages really quick and

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
really fast and what are people going to

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,239
do they're going to micro needle they're

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
going to exfoliate the crap out of their

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
skin and then they're going to use all

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,239
kinds of different ointments and

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
different creams that have all kinds of

89
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,840
fragrances in them that hurt our skin

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,519
once again it's from the inside out and

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,159
it's about getting to the deep

92
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,799
underneath layer into that sponge into

93
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,040
that Derma right here way further deep

94
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,560
underneath the follicles that's where it

95
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,120
counts that's how you heal the surface

96
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,320
that's how you heal the middle we can't

97
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,840
control every situation we can't control

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,639
the stress runder the oxidative stress

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,360
we can't control someone else and what

100
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:28,759
they do we can't control the weather we

101
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,479
can't control a hurricane we can't

102
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,720
control the evil that happens on this

103
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,360
planet and there's a lot of evil

104
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,440
happening on this planet we know that

105
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,039
can't control any of that but so many

106
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,000
people are worried about their skin I

107
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,080
hear it until the cows come home so what

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
I love about the Skin Potion what I'm

109
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,639
showing you is immune system and then

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,280
building blocks for skin I'm going to

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,479
get some water get a little bit of water

112
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,800
here this is warm water so to make the

113
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
Skin Potion you need some warm water

114
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,000
first things first we're going to put a

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,000
scoop in here of the micro then we're

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,600
going to put two capsules of the MSM the

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,440
bamboo silica right here I'm opening

118
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,080
capsules then I'm looking for a little

119
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
knife here because I'm going to put

120
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,560
orange you can choose lemon but I'm

121
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
going to put orange and there's a reason

122
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,039
why orange is going in here it's not for

123
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,840
flavor and it's not for Taste although

124
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,919
it does taste good because it's a juicy

125
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,000
orange we're going to squeeze half an

126
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,120
orange in here the reason is because

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,560
what's in this orange are two things one

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,160
is calcium there's a little bit of

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,479
silica and orange too and there's

130
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,280
vitamin C three things what we have in

131
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
this orange are three things but I need

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,520
those three things because I am

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,280
introducing those three things in its

134
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,120
living form fresh out of an orange to

135
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,479
the pure form here so what we're doing

136
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,400
is we're introducing the actual

137
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,000
synergetic blend of these together now

138
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,840
here's the cool thing the orange in

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,240
there not only makes it taste good but

140
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,479
what it's doing is that vitamin C inside

141
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,880
the orange right there is connecting to

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,120
the two kinds of pure vitamin C in here

143
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,880
in the immune power we're mixing them at

144
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,400
the same time we're connecting the

145
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,680
calcium the vitamin C and silica to the

146
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,000
MSM we're connecting the silica that's

147
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,840
naturally in an orange there's a little

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,360
bit in an orange we're connecting that

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,360
to the organic bamboo silica we're

150
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,880
connecting that to the two other

151
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,000
varieties of vitamin C powerful vitamin

152
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,840
C and we're putting it all together and

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,120
we're making our Skin Potion all right

154
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,120
so let's get some warm water in

155
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,039
here and you have the Skin Potion right

156
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,840
