1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Sure Shot how powerful and amazing and

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,980
empowering that is right there I'm

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,080
excited there it is let's see what it

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,080
looks like whoa that's really that's

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,180
awesome that's what we're doing right

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:22,020
there today I am pumped up big time

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,880
but more so than that I am excited to be

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,820
talking about the pesticide herbicide

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,740
fungicide exposure it's one of my

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,660
favorite topics to be honest

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,200
It's a combination of being sad

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,780
huh

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,719
and happy

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,219
yeah it's a combination of both because

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,020
when you think about pesticides

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,700
herbicides and fungicides and how they

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,600
actually really do affect our lives and

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,480
how we do get exposed to them and then

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,160
that's the sad part like what I'm

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,020
exposed to this this is what we're going

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,899
to talk about which is kind of shocking

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,840
look out your mind might go boom right

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,420
and then the happy part can we do

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,840
anything about it is there anything to

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,119
do about it what can we do and that's

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,159
the other part I'm Anthony William the

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,560
medical medium this is the brain saver

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,479
book I'm reading this is the brain saver

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,220
medical medium range shot therapy

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,159
cleanse challenge I'm excited you guys

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,820
so let's get down to it why not

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
why not because this is look I got a

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,280
thing for pesticides and herbicides and

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,820
fungicides I really do because it's one

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,280
of those antagonists that neuro

36
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,799
antagonists that are in everybody's face

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
but people don't know it and they don't

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,280
realize it

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,979
and so I like this topic because when

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,759
people don't know what's going on

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,280
and you can actually educate you can

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,140
provide information that's incredible so

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,079
they can then protect themselves it

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,060
feels good like this is a feel-good

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,759
topic for me

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,759
because it's about awareness and when

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,239
people become aware it changes the world

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,680
and that's amazing so let's go into it a

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,840
little bit so I'm on page 224 by the way

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,239
it's day 18. I'm actually blown away

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,760
like how are we getting through this

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,720
we're going 20 days are we really gonna

53
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,200
do this

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:31,459
I'm on page 224 brain saver right there

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,459
let's cut into it

56
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:38,340
Rogue spraying practices whoa that's

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,360
interesting on a Zone let's just I'm

58
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,640
going through this now this is

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,739
incredible common chemical neuro

60
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,720
antagonists just going to give you a

61
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:47,760
little bit of a rundown

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,860
chemical fertilizers

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,940
okay but you're not exposed to any of

64
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,800
those

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,060
yes you are

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,160
lawn treatments lawn treatments huh but

67
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,580
you're not exposed to any of those

68
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,739
yes you are

69
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,540

mosquito killer you're definitely

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,940
exposed to Mosquito Killers sorry to say

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,980
that this is this is an interesting

79
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,319
episode today

80
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,940
we're live right now by the way termite

81
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:42,360
killer uh-huh termite killer yeah and

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,019
gypsy moth killer oh I'm not exposed to

83
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,299
gypsy moth killer yes you are

84
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,599
all right

85
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:54,420
here's a bullet point right here

86
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:57,540
nighttime aerial insecticide spray

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,959
uh-huh planet Earth

88
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,580
has something very evil

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,420
within it

90
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,099
and they do the nighttime aerial spray

91
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,840
on every village

92
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,580
on every town

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,319
in every County

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,919
in every state

95
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,900
in every country across the world

96
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,380
that's what they do

97
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,199
it's so certain helicopters with vials

98
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,419
on them releasing a mist

99
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,820
and it's aerosol

100
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,820
aerial insecticide spray

101
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:36,840
all right see why this is like one of my

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,240
favorite favorite subjects

103
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,960
so we're on page 24

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,220
not page 24 sorry chapter 24 page 223 a

105
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,880
brain saver

106
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,259
and we're reading about chemical neuro

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,820
antagonists and we don't think we're

108
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,800
exposed to

109
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,320
now I personally would rather know what

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,259
I'm exposed to so that I can do things

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,780
to look out I can be careful I could

112
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,880
make sure I don't walk into a lawn

113
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,280
treatment that's being sprayed I make

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,440
sure that a family member or family

115
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,360
members aren't walking into a lawn

116
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,240
treatment that's being sprayed or

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,699
whatever so it's like I like this

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,960
information because you can do something

119
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,960
it's empowering

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,120
larvicides yeah heck yeah rodenticides a

121
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,039
hot rat killer

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,600
there's rat killer everywhere on crops

123
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,979
conventional crops there's rat killer

124
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,900
and buildings there's rat killer and

125
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:35,360
condos there's Rock rat killer

126
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,360
everywhere around buildings

127
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,740
other pesticides of course

128
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,759
sea trails

129
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,440
yep

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,320
chemical neuro antagonists sea trails

131
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,000
that's right

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,100
herbicides you know sea trails

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,860
right

134
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,960
herbicides DDT and fungicides but ddt's

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,080
not around here anymore all right we

136
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,320
don't have to worry about DDT anymore

137
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,199
no we don't have to right it's only

138
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,560
dropped out of planes

139
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,880
up in the sky that leave the streak in

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,580
the sky with old abandoned

141
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,780
excess DDT

142
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,000
that has been filled into it right DDT

143
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,880
is everywhere too by the way it floats

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,680
around continents it floats around the

145
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,900
earth we still breathe it in and

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,940
everybody still has a portion of DDT

147
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,139
inside their livers and bodies that's

148
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,080
passed down from generation to

149
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,880
generation to generation PBT didn't go

150
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,460
away

151
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,180
like I said sea Trails right

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,520
the old plane

153
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,020
and fungicides that's another one

154
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,319
fungicides I don't get exposed to

155
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,419
fungicides are you kidding oh yeah you

156
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,300
do you do get exposed to fungicides

157
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,060
every single new article of clothing you

158
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,639
buy including organic clothing can be

159
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,660
laced with the fungicide you can smell

160
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,500
it

161
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:10,440
if you learn the smell of fungicide

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,900
smoke exposure of any kind

163
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,840
including cigarettes

164
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:19,620
yum yum marijuana

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,139
yum yum vaping yum yum

166
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,080
yummy smoke smells

167
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,880
smells good anyway people get exposed to

168
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,919
that too and how about this one

169
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,340
fluoride

170
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,979
fluoride interesting right yeah fluoride

171
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,800
treatments fluoride in general and

172
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:40,259
chlorine how many people are exposed to

173
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,500
chlorine so I love that chemical neuro

174
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,599
antagonist section

175
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,800
inside brain saver I'm going to read a

176
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,240
little bit about it let's do the fun

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
part that wasn't even the fun part

178
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,199
okay

179
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,440
chemical neuro antagonists sounds like

180
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,419
such a serious category that it must be

181
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,099
difficult to come in contact with any of

182
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,199
these chemical agents right

183
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm not exposed to any chemical neuro

184
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:09,300
antagonists what kind of world are you

185
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,919
living in that's not me I'm not exposed

186
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,960
to that

187
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,539
quite the contrary

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,300
we're up against these brain betrayers

189
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:21,120
more than we know

190
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,919
walk through a park

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,440
if you walk through a park

192
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,020
they hose those Parks down they've been

193
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,720
doing it for a hundred years

194
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,580
parks are hosed down

195
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,539
with all kinds of chemical neuro

196
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,399
antagonists hosed down

197
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,380
I know

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,300
it's just a fact

199
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,660
s are hosed down with chemical

200
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,940
antagonists

201
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,160
golf anybody want to play some golf

202
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,200
right

203
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,420
well golf it's the same way golf courses

204
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,380
really hose down chemical fertilizers

205
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,519
that's a huge one chemical fertilizers

206
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:06,360
pesticides herbicides especially

207
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:11,060
herbicides all sprayed on golf courses

208
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,060
they're at least sometimes twice a week

209
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,760
what else campus green

210
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,720
campus greens

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,820
what is that college universities campus

212
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,779
greens laced with fungicides herbicides

213
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,779
pesticides rodenticides

214
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,220
so we got that one there that's a fun

215
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,279
one or Town Commons you're sitting in

216
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,920
the town common the Town Square the town

217
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,620
green definitely

218
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,580
laced

219
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:51,180
eating conventional grown produce duh

220
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,120
we get a little bit of that in us anyway

221
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,480
food made from a conventional grown crop

222
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,860
or even organic food grown on former

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,800
conventional fields and that's another

224
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,620
thing we can't ex we can't escape the

225
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,760
neuro antagonists we can avoid a lot of

226
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,200
them

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,860
but organic food is grown out of land

228
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,019
that's been saturated from DDT saturated

229
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,500
from conventional sprays

230
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,660
saturated from pesticide herbicides

231
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,000
they wait like seven years and then an

232
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,160
organic farm moves in and organic crops

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,860
are grown right seven years doesn't rip

234
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,200
DDT out of soil I'm sorry but it doesn't

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,019
and it doesn't rip DDT out of soil from

236
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,120
50 years ago it doesn't read pesticides

237
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,640
out of soil

238
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,100
organic crops have pesticides we can't

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,200
get away from it

240
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,300
organic food grown on former

241
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,899
conventional fields which is virtually

242
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,420
almost every single organic feel this is

243
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,180
critical to know they're not chopping

244
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:57,860
down forest here in the United States to

245
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,899
grow a organic field

246
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,880
organic fields are organic fields that

247
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,399
have taken over conventional fields we

248
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,800
need to understand this it's yes eat

249
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,480
organic food absolutely

250
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,640
but understand

251
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,740
that that organic food is growing

252
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,140
unconventional fields

253
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,399
because they were all conventional

254
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,579
fields

255
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,640
all of them were conventional fields to

256
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:26,220
start with going back decades ago they

257
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,480
were all conventional produce Fields you

258
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,140
guys

259
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,160
and slowly organic moved in on these

260
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,980
fields

261
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,839
they bought the conventional farms and

262
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,760
they grew organic produce that's how

263
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,440
it's done

264
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,440
incredible information right

265
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,579
okay eat

266
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,740
conventionally raised chicken or pork or

267
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,600
beef or fish people do that all the time

268
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,360
yes they get exposure

269
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,800
handle conventionally grown

270
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,820
flowers

271
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,620
someone sent me flowers the other day

272
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,600
they're released

273
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,440
it was a really good

274
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,600
nice gift it was incredible gesture

275
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,000
it was pleasing

276
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,399
there's beautiful flowers

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,180
but they're laced

278
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,839
conventional grown flowers

279
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,839
and then

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,480
there's neighbors chemically treated

281
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,100
yards

282
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,079
so that's a big one there so neighbors

283
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,839
if you have a neighbor they chemically

284
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:35,700
treat the yards does everybody know but

285
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,920
most everybody does if the neighbor

286
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,779
doesn't the other neighbor does

287
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,980
if the other neighbor doesn't this

288
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,200
neighbor does

289
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,880
so there's a treatment coming somewhere

290
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,019
someone's getting a spray around their

291
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
house someone's getting into remote

292
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,920
spray someone's getting some kind of

293
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,320
mosquito spray or tick spray someone's

294
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,880
getting a ant spray

295
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,500
it's just over and over again someone's

296
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,120
getting fertilizer on their little lawn

297
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,800
patch someone's getting some fungicide

298
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
sprayed on their weeds someone's getting

299
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,820
some weed killer sprayed on their weeds

300
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,380
it's just you can't get away from it if

301
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,120
it isn't this neighbor then it's this

302
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,920
neighbor here and then the wind blows

303
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,360
that to you then it's if it's not that

304
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,980
neighbor it's this neighbor here and the

305
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,800
wind blows that to you if you're in an

306
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,779
apartment building same thing

307
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,300
same thing people bomb their Apartments

308
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,339
Apartment next door to you inside an

309
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,220
apartment building they're bombing it

310
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,959
that bombing is a pesticide herbicide

311
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,760
fungicide bomb

312
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,220
it happens all the time people get

313
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,860
people get pesticide bombs inside their

314
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,980
Apartments to get rid of bed bugs to get

315
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,660
rid of silverfish to get rid of fleas

316
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,820
so in apartment buildings it's all the

317
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,040
same everybody's bombing for fleas in

318
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,860
one apartment at Roaches for another one

319
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,000
silverfish in another one bed bugs in

320
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,180
another one

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,180
foreign

322
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,899
can't you see why this is one of my

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,899
favorite topics

324
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,880
in chemical lawn fertilizers and

325
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,519
treatments people often spray the

326
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
interiors and exteriors of schools oh

327
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,720
that's a big one right there the

328
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,480
institutions the institutions

329
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,420
have to purchase spray

330
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,680
they have to have contracts with

331
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,459
chemical

332
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,839
spray companies

333
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:23,160
so schools

334
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,940
have to have contracts with all of the

335
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,360
extermination services and everything

336
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,360
else

337
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,079
they spray the interiors and exteriors

338
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,380
of schools offices apartment complexes

339
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,440
dorm rooms dorm rooms are big

340
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:43,199
the bed bug spray they use in those

341
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,839
unbelievable dorm rooms hotels houses

342
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,139
warehouses storage facilities and other

343
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,120
buildings with roach killer ant killer

344
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,220
termite killer wasp killer mosquito

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,680
killer tick killer and more

346
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,040
so it's all too easy to breathe in or

347
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,740
even touch chemical neuro antagonist

348
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,839
contamination you guys

349
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,600
it's how easy it is

350
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,699
fear-mongering anyone no

351
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,399
it's important to know what's around you

352
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:15,180
because it stops a person from walking

353
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:17,339
into it I've watched it for years I see

354
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,260
it outside if I'm in a car somewhere

355
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:22,500
driving or being driven around or

356
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,720
something I see like literally people

357
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,060
with those canisters and people walking

358
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,339
by just not even realizing and breathing

359
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,740
it in it happens everywhere on the side

360
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,199
of Highways every place

361
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,480
it's really incredible

362
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,639
Jenny Jen on YouTube my next door

363
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,680
neighbor at my apartment doused the bush

364
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,100
next to my bedroom window

365
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,040
with diesel gasoline to kill it I was

366
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,860
waking up with massive headaches and my

367
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,899
apartment was filled with the smell

368
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,820
so many horror stories like that Jenny

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,560
amazing

381
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,660
and

382
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,399
um

383
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,860
Tate says

384
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,320
I've healed and got rid of over a dozen

385
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,240
symptoms using conventional produce with

386
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,800
the medical media books and info and t I

387
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,959
talk about that that people can use

388
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,600
conventional produce and heal absolutely

389
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,940
I talk about how conventional celery you

390
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,240
can't get organic conventional produce

391
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:52,139
if you can't get organic

392
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,699
foreign practices

393
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,779
Rogue

394
00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:00,000
keep in mind on that word rogue

395
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,820
organic crops

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,760
whoa

397
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,579
organic crops

398
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,220
while organic crops aren't sprayed with

399
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,199
conventional pesticides

400
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,839
and herbicides

401
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,540
still come with exposures

402
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,120
for one

403
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:23,640
organic farming relies upon

404
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,319
the same solvents

405
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,500
degreasers

406
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,260
and cleaning agents for their equipment

407
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,640
tractors and trucks

408
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,640
as conventional farming

409
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,160
if you know anything like that

410
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,160
I've driven a tractor

411
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,940
I've greased a tractor

412
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,660
I've maintenance

413
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,160
equipment

414
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,160
I know what this means

415
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,480
it's not like Organic Farms

416
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,760
are free from solvents chemicals

417
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,679
degreasers

418
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,140
all kinds of different

419
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,419
agents

420
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,480
exhaust coming out of tractors gets

421
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:13,740
blown on all the crops your Organic Crop

422
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,660
is still going to get diesel fumes

423
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,120
blown

424
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,940
on all the crops

425
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,240
every single day as the tractors go up

426
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,240
and down

427
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,360
foreign

428
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,340
it's just interesting right I mean isn't

429
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,720
that interesting it's just it's

430
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,960
incredible to have this window of

431
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
information

432
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,160
this exposure Finds Its way into produce

433
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,020
plus dangerous mosquito sprays and other

434
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,059
insecticides are dumped out of

435
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,039
helicopters and planes all around the

436
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:48,720
U.S and other places around the world I

437
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,640
talked about that

438
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,500
these high concentrations of mosquito

439
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
spray

440
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,400
from low-flying planes and low-flying

441
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,440
helicopters Dallas organic crops

442
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,700
including Fields where grass-fed cattle

443
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:05,120
are grazing

444
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,120
just as they do any other Farm or yard

445
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,039
why do they spray mosquito spray in

446
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,740
every single part of the world

447
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,620
because they grow the mosquitoes

448
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,320
genetically mutate and alter them

449
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,780
GMO the mosquitoes and let trillions and

450
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,700
trillions of mosquitoes out daily

451
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,679
so that the mosquito come spray

452
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,960
companies

453
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,460
convince everybody that you got to pay

454
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,900
the bill

455
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,580
they convinced all the governments you

456
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,520
have to pay the bill all around the

457
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,440
world and so there's mosquito spray two

458
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,780
stop mosquitoes that they're growing and

459
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,160
releasing right you see this sick sick

460
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,620
world we live in

461
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,740
Stevens Ranch says you give us hope and

462
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,640
strength to heal

463
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,640
amazing incredible yeah

464
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,960
yeah so

465
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,640
the chemical companies providing the

466
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:03,440
spray and flight patterns do not

467
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,440
purposely avoid Organic Farms

468
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:12,419
yeah yeah Mac yep

469
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,480
yeah yeah there's a whole bunch of

470
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,679
organic farms ahead of you change your

471
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,520
trajectory

472
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,919
yep just keep on no no don't don't spray

473
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,940
that mosquito spray there's a whole

474
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,980
bunch of

475
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,580
vegans

476
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,919
and animal protein vegetable fruit Eater

477
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,360
people they love their organic produce

478
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't Spray that mosquito spray over

479
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,660
there okay right on all right Roger out

480
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,480
no it doesn't work that way every single

481
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,760
organic farm is sprayed

482
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,400
through helicopters in the air dropping

483
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,580
mosquito spray it is not immune to it

484
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,600
they don't just stop they go over every

485
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,600
place everywhere

486
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,419
foreign

487
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,679
cities and towns are sprayed by

488
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,660
helicopter for bugs like mosquitoes and

489
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,880
gypsy moth caterpillars

490
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,700
so see if you can find out the local

491
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,500
schedule and stay indoors with windows

492
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,240
closed at those times but chances are

493
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,640
they won't tell you any local schedules

494
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,380
because they won't there's very few

495
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
places in the world

496
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,120
that tell you there's going to be

497
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,799
helicopter spray for mosquitoes some

498
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,900
counties do in some areas of this

499
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,980
country and around the world but it's

500
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,679
rare

501
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,539
and it's not always accurate keep in

502
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,880
mind that scheduling is never a

503
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,840
definitive operation I have it right

504
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,299
here

505
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,820
even if you have the local schedule in

506
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,520
hand it is not guaranteed to be correct

507
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:44,400
timing is never exact

508
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,860
ly never is very interesting

509
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,340
it's always extremely loosey-goosey

510
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:53,340
that's a word lucy-goosey and spraying

511
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,140
is often done without forewarning trust

512
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,820
your instincts if you see here or smell

513
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,080
something suspicious

514
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,080
use your Snoop

515
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,500
on IG

516
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,539
nit uh says why do you keep writing so

517
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,000
many books why not write everything in

518
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,740
one book well

519
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,600
that's what I tried to do where's my

520
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,980
other book here oh let me just get it

521
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,980
over here excuse me

522
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,640
this is one book

523
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,840
right there it is

524
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,520
it's the old one book too big too much

525
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,740
information

526
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,620
bookstores don't want a book this big

527
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,600
publisher can't print out books this big

528
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,179
shipping books this big is really hard

529
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,520
and this book's 12 pounds I think I mean

530
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,140
don't quote me on that I don't know but

531
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,520
it feels like it's 10 pounds or

532
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,840
something

533
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,840
and I have to say uncle

534
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,700
because

535
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,100
I have to say uncle to Spirit of

536
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,260
compassion because

537
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,020
these books

538
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,720
take a lot out of me

539
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,280
and there's eight big ones

540
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,559
there's eight books packed with

541
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,240
information too much information to fit

542
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,400
into them

543
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,960
and I just pray to God every day to give

544
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,520
me the strength to listen to Spirit of

545
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,520
compassion and write another book

546
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
thank you for asking

547
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,240
if you like going to a public park find

548
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,240
out his particular treatment schedule

549
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,100
too and see if you can wait for a good

550
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,500
Reign between when it's sprayed or

551
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,000
fertilized and when you can visit if

552
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,039
you're sensitive keep in mind for people

553
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,539
who have chronic illness this is this

554
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,299
tips to scale

555
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:43,760
you sit in a park on the ground

556
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:43,760
that was just doused with herbicide

557
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:47,280
and it's woofing everywhere and you

558
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,380
smell it everywhere let's make her break

559
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,000
when you got chronic sickness that's

560
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,159
make or break

561
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,940
when you got chronic sickness set you

562
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,940
back for weeks

563
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,260
when you do go take along a blanket so

564
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,240
you don't end up sitting untreated grass

565
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,700
treated ground

566
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,460
pregnant women should take special care

567
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,320
with all of this direct pesticide

568
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,740
herbicide or fungicide exposure can be

569
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,659
enough to cause pregnancy complications

570
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,919
that kind of intense skull and crossbone

571
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,559
exposure

572
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,720
which is sprayed directly out of trucks

573
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:25,380
and canisters

574
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,299
on the ground direct exposure to that

575
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,919
spray like if they're spraying and a

576
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,900
pregnant woman is breathing it in it's

577
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,679
getting in her in her face and on her

578
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,659
skin

579
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,659
can be a dangerous thing

580
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,039
June says in IG the area here sprays at

581
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,780
night and if I have windows open I

582
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,240
quickly try to close the windows it's

583
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,900
awful smelling too

584
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,960
I believe you because I've seen it for

585
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,320
years anywhere I've lived in the United

586
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,320
States

587
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,460
here's an interesting part right here

588
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,020
DDT isn't gone

589
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:04,500
DDT

590
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:07,260
is in a pesticide class all on its own

591
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,360
this toxin it seems like a problem of

592
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,240
the past because it's in the past it's

593
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,059
still very much with us today it's in

594
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,320
our oceans it's in our Lakes it's in our

595
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,539
streams

596
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,539
it's in our reservoirs

597
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:23,360
and other water reservoirs agricultural

598
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,880
fields and more

599
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,559
DDT is in all those places plus it's

600
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,779
still in use in some parts of the world

601
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,900
it's still in use

602
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,220
it's in use in a lot of places in in the

603
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,240
world

604
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,240
it's incredible really

605
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,900
plus it's still in use in some parts of

606
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,539
the world and what and wins you know the

607
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,880
wind air

608
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:51,840
can even carry it from continent to

609
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,820
continent what's more DDT passes along

610
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,799
through Bloodlines from generation to

611
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,740
generation so

612
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,919
if one of your forebears was exposed in

613
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,320
ddt's Heyday that same DVT from back

614
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,360
then could now be in your body and brain

615
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,740
my father

616
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,740
the medical medium's father

617
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,640
he just told me recently and he's told

618
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,020
me before but he reminded me that when

619
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,760
he was a kid

620
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,059
he used to play

621
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,580
right behind the DVT trucks they used to

622
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,980
drive by through the parks and him and

623
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:28,320
his friends would run up behind the

624
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,059
truck and they would spray

625
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,220
all the kids down

626
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:38,100
my dad said he was sprayed a lot

627
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,140
he had Direct DBT application all on his

628
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,820
body was just set it up all in his hair

629
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,320
and all over his body

630
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,000
and

631
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,880
that means

632
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,440
he passed it on down to me

633
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,419
so

634
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,940
just being born

635
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:55,320
I had DDT contamination the medical

636
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,100
media

637
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,100
it's incredible

638
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,919
in farming a lot of fields are recycled

639
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,380
oh wait there's still a little bit more

640
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,480
DDT passes along through Bloodlines from

641
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,760
generation to generation so if one of

642
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,640
your forebears was exposed in ddt's

643
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,659
Heyday that same DDT from back then

644
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,059
could now be in your body and brain

645
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,580
correct

646
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:26,659
in farming a lot of fields are recycled

647
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,000
almost all the Farmland is in use today

648
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,980
is Farmland from the 1930s 40s and 50s

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,419
so this is interesting

650
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:39,960
almost all of the Farmland we use today

651
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:42,179
is recycled it's from the 30s the 40s

652
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,860
the 50s and the 60s on IG saved by

653
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,080
plants my father played behind those

654
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,700
trucks too

655
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,000
it's incredible

656
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,860
it's incredible

657
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,080
in 1960s that was heavily sprayed with

658
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,580
DDT so all the Recycled Farms that were

659
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,559
actually eating our food out were spread

660
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,419
with DDT but not just sprayed with DDT

661
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,419
like sprayed with DVT

662
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,279
so DDT is still in the dirt

663
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,679
that's true whether the Farmland is used

664
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,860
for conventional or organic farming

665
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,120
today

666
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:19,200
organic farming

667
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,480
unless that organic farm

668
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,640
was in a forest

669
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,279
not in a forest it was a forest first

670
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,500
the forest was cut down

671
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,200
and then the organic farm was created

672
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,299
out of that Forest

673
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,159
that's the only time it's possible

674
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:38,159
there's no DDT

675
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,620
in heavy amounts in the ground but there

676
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,620
still will be DDT in the ground

677
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,620
that's how much DDT was sprayed around

678
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,760
this planet still around this planet and

679
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,760
used to be sprayed here

680
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,419
that's true whether the Farmland is used

681
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,419
for conventional or organic farming

682
00:28:54,419 --> 00:29:00,419
today most organic farm land was

683
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:04,860
converted to organic from conventional

684
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:08,480
farming almost all organic Farmland was

685
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,480
conventional Farms

686
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,340
this in an interesting way I just got to

687
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,080
be honest with you guys it's kind of

688
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,039
funny where and I was like all right I

689
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,380
can't wait to tell everybody about

690
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,679
pesticides herbicides and and neuro

691
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,480
antagonists and right and and I was

692
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,919
telling SOC this morning like a five in

693
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,260
the morning when I woke up I was telling

694
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,679
SSC like I can't wait to tell everybody

695
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,740
about this stuff but it's so boring it's

696
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,659
so boring chemicals and pesticides and

697
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,700
herbicides this is boring crap it's like

698
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,860
and I said to associ this morning said

699
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,260
how do I make it interesting and and

700
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,880
what do I do like do I do a dance when

701
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,919
I'm actually saying this dude this stuff

702
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,899
is boring right it's like chemical spray

703
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,679
mosquito spray

704
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:54,200
foreign

705
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,200
but still it's like my favorite topic

706
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
um

707
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,980
by lupier says Balu Piper says been

708
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,039
following medical meeting protocol four

709
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,679
years Advanced heavy metal detox

710
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,640
smoothie

711
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:09,059
um

712
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,520
the 20-day challenge has

713
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:14,580
rocketed my healing thank you medical

714
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,320
medium these daily teachings gives us as

715
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,320
much as the books incredible

716
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,100
The Organic certification

717
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,100
rules

718
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,440
usually state that in the range of five

719
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,480
to seven to ten years without

720
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,980
conventional spray land can be deemed

721
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,980
suitable for organic farming

722
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,000
but those herbicides last a lot longer

723
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,500
than that they're in the dirt

724
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,559
DDT lives many years past this in soil

725
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,419
DDT has a half-life of a good 100 to 200

726
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,299
years

727
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:57,059
100 to 200 years

728
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:58,620
all right well

729
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,299
son

730
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,580
daughter

731
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:05,640
you'll be able to farm that land over

732
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,760
there ddt-free

733
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,779
but you're gonna have to tell your

734
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,340
grandchildren that they're going to be

735
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:14,100
able to farm it too

736
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,620
and their children and then maybe it

737
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,440
will be DDT reduced

738
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:23,419
Gotta Wait 200 years Linda Larkin said

739
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,419
this is disappointing not really alive

740
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,340
really this is alive

741
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm live right now

742
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,799
I'm talking about all the different

743
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,960
chemical fertilizers and sprays and DBT

744
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,159
and I just read your comment right now

745
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
that we're live

746
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,100
sorry

747
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,919
I know it's no fun but exposure to this

748
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,919
stuff is important to know because you

749
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,179
can avoid it you really can avoid a lot

750
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,039
of it

751
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,220
it's pretty incredible how much you can

752
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:02,940
avoid when you have this knowledge

753
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,799
and that's just crops animals whether

754
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,960
raised conventionally or organically

755
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,600
grazing fields that were once Fields

756
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,580
conventionally sprayed with DDT DDT

757
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,020
still in our bodies we still eat

758
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,840
conventional

759
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:18,659
conventional animals we still eat

760
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,679
organically grown animals pasture free

761
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,539
range

762
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,039
that people are eating still DVT in them

763
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:27,779
unregulated fungicide exposure let's hit

764
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,039
this this is actually pretty interesting

765
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:35,039
right here right here this is pretty

766
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,039
interesting okay

767
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,659
this one is

768
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:44,039
that's not mine right

769
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:46,799
did not have my celery juice

770
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,640
I was really busy this morning

771
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,640
just need to sit

772
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,620
fungicides are recent sorry fungicides

773
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,100
are secretly everywhere too

774
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,380
fungicides I hate fungicides coating

775
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,779
more and more items you buy encounter in

776
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,299
daily life if you buy something out

777
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:11,820
there in the world and and it comes in

778
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:13,799
the mail or you go to a store sometimes

779
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,720
you'll smell a fungicide you won't be

780
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,059
familiar with it if you're sprayed with

781
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,399
cologne and perfume and you have

782
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,679
plug-ins in the walls of air fresheners

783
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,000
and you use spray air fresheners on your

784
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,039
furniture you probably won't even smell

785
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,200
the fungicide because because your house

786
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,620
is one big smell right

787
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,080
but it's on stuff that we get and you

788
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,519
can smell it many times it's on a lot of

789
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,019
things

790
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,019
there's no warning

791
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:43,380
it's on items you buy and encounter in

792
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,179
daily life no one's told

793
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,240
this

794
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:51,600
was sprayed with fungicide no not my

795
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,799
book but this no one was told

796
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,880
by the way I'm reading out of brain

797
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,580
saver that's why I'm showing you the

798
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,919
book right now I'm on page

799
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,080
225

800
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,019
foreign

801
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,519
but you can stop using a lot of

802
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,799
fungicide

803
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,020
use out there you can like halt a lot of

804
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:11,460
it when you let companies know when you

805
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,740
order clothes and you say what's sprayed

806
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:18,060
on here why does it smell

807
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:20,339
you know and you can actually train

808
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,200
production of you know clothing the

809
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:23,159
companies and stuff like that to be more

810
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,220
careful

811
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,960
to be aware of it

812
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,879
no one's told this was sprayed with a

813
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,159
fungicide there's no warning on the

814
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,260
package no tag on clothing no

815
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,899
forewarning clothing

816
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:40,800
is one of the most fungicide sprayed

817
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,119
items we have in our lives

818
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,580
they don't

819
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,080
put a tag on all the new clothing you

820
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,060
purchase from whatever company or

821
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,060
fashion company or just regular company

822
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:53,820
whatever it is

823
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,919
there should be a tag saying was sprayed

824
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:59,160
with fungicide

825
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,760
stick in the laundry right away do not

826
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:07,619
try on unless it's washed

827
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,320
if you tried on these jeans

828
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,960
before they were washed you have to go

829
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,700
shower like they don't put any of that

830
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,079
on there there should be a tag saying

831
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,720
all this

832
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,280
Health queen says I was so allergic to a

833
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,079
new couch but thought it was my

834
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,000
imagination fungicides are really

835
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,859
sprayed on new couches new chairs all

836
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,960
the time

837
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:30,660
there's no warning on a package no tag

838
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,359
on clothing no forewarning it is a

839
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,720
secret campaign what

840
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,720
what

841
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,280
it's a secret campaign that no one

842
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,320
speaks about

843
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,500
hmm

844
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,420
no one knows about other than big

845
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,579
fungicide companies in manufacturing

846
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,740
it's a campaign

847
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,079
from the fungicide companies in

848
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,320
manufacturing companies

849
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,619
it's actually a secret

850
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,980
it is sprayed on everything they sell

851
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:11,640
the fungicide to clothing manufacturers

852
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,940
it's sprayed on everything there isn't a

853
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,560
tag or a forewarning which should be on

854
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,560
every single thing you buy

855
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,220
and there is some clothing that doesn't

856
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,560
have it and it's a miracle but it's

857
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,020
getting less and less like that

858
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,500
there is some clothing that doesn't

859
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,740
that's not sprayed with fungicide

860
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:40,140
it actually exists out there still I try

861
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,820
to choose those Brands where I'm

862
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,500
familiar with them so I choose the

863
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,020
brands that are not sprayed with

864
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,339
fungicide when I get used to them and

865
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm like you know what this didn't come

866
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,520
with a fungicide smell it's not making

867
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,619
you sick when I breathe it in because

868
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,839
it's really intense

869
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:56,400
some stuff can come and it's like whoa

870
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:59,040
It's got to go in the laundry right away

871
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,380
right the point is is that when I find

872
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,060
clothing that I don't smell any

873
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:06,000
fungicide on

874
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,560
then that's the stuff I stick with

875
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,420
those are the brands I stick with that's

876
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,839
usually what happens like in my personal

877
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,839
life

878
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,060
yeah but usually I still have to wash

879
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:24,000
everything

880
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,380
when it comes because stuff will have

881
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,380
all kinds of stuff on it right

882
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,000
okay so let's go into this a little bit

883
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,000
more

884
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,060
what happens is this any corporation

885
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,119
that manufactures a product is sought

886
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,460
out by suppliers

887
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,380
chemical companies will send sales reps

888
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,420
to meet with manufacturing companies and

889
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,099
sell them on the fungicide chemicals

890
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,619
that they want the corporation to spray

891
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:56,220
on everything they manufacture

892
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:58,440
Boom the manufacturers then take the

893
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,880
fungicides put them in spray Jets and

894
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,740
spray them

895
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,900
spray these dangerous fungicide

896
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,460
chemicals on every single item and

897
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,839
package

898
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,579
no one's monitoring this

899
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,400
there's no federal law

900
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,400
this is total Rogue contamination

901
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,480
this information is just insane

902
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,700
thrift store clothes are saturated with

903
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,900
perfumes colognes and air fresheners big

904
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,900
time because I know people say well go

905
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:31,280
to a thrift store man sometimes this

906
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:34,520
stuff is just saturated mold

907
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:37,800
fungicide air fresheners

908
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,060
perfumes colognes right gotta look out

909
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,440
that way too

910
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,060
but if you don't mind any of that

911
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,980
whatever then

912
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,160
that's okay if you don't mind any of

913
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,160
that

914
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,579
no one's monitoring this there's no

915
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,680
federal law this is total Road

916
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,839
contamination when you handle items

917
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,260
sprayed with fungicides

918
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:01,079
nowhere does it say patent number one

919
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:04,020
seven three two two eight four dot dot

920
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,359
dot applied

921
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,320
nowhere does it show a skull and

922
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:13,560
crossbones nowhere does it warn immune

923
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,560
system diminisher

924
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:22,099
with a list of side effects nope and yet

925
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,180
fungicides are in every country

926
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:27,359
manufacturing plants throughout the

927
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,280
world are sold this fungicide you're not

928
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,440
allowed to be informed of any of this

929
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm informing you of something you're

930
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,960
not allowed to be informed with

931
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,820
Sarah Nichols when I worked in fashion

932
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,980
development I got so sick and would open

933
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,500
boxes and boxes of our samples from

934
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,859
other countries I would get so sick and

935
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,020
my throat always hurt Sarah

936
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,640
you're validated

937
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,320
totally

938
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,540
I always worry about people in the

939
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,220
fashion industry I worry about people

940
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,839
that handle all the clothes in the

941
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,540
fashion industry

942
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,220
it's like a life shortener I'd be real

943
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,040
Brave to work in the fashion industry

944
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,560
real Brave

945
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,079

also applied on crops hospitals are

949
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,680
really doused in the campaign the

951
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,300

972

basically it's a trillion dollar

984

business for chemical companies to

985
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:51,180
produce this much fungicide to sell to

986
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:54,140
every manufacturer and nobody knows

987
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,140
about it

988
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,540
so wacko

989
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,240
it's unbelievable

990
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,220
they made it a standard of Industries to

991
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,900
grandfather and fungicides against any

992
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,000
ramifications from these dangerous

993
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,320
chemicals let's make the shot I could

994
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,480
just read on I mean there's so much

995
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,520
information in there

996
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,859
so let's actually

997
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,780
there's just so much info in there it's

998
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:20,640
just packed

999
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,740
that's the shot we're making right here

1000
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,020
pesticide herbicide and fungicide

1001
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,040
exposure shot right there you guys

1002
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,040
but you know

1003
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:34,619
so let's roll it out let's get the

1004
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,000
juicer out

1005
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,540
I'm excited about this

1006
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,220
Loop is free with celery 333 I started

1007
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,560
crocheting and my fingers and hands

1008
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,540
started to get eczema and after some

1009
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,940
research I found that the yarn had

1010
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,800
formaldehydes in it so there's there's

1011
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:57,240
one right there

1012
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,619
that lumus free with celery 333

1013
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,619
pretty amazing

1014
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,440
hit the wall

1015
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,440
all right you guys

1016
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:12,480
let's make this one so quarter cup

1017
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,760
tightly packed fresh

1018
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,560
parsley

1019
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
so quarter cup is not going to be too

1020
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,020
too much

1021
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,020
so let's just get in here

1022
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,099
nice

1023
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,619
this horse is really really fresh right

1024
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,619
now which is exciting

1025
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:41,359
here we go

1026
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,359
next half cup tightly packed cilantro

1027
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,140
incredible

1028
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,359
half cup tightly packed let's get some

1029
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,980
cilantro in here some people like

1030
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,460
cilantro people some people don't

1031
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,140
there's two kinds of people in the world

1032
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,500
people that like cilantro and people

1033
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,500
that go

1034
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,960
people that are really high in heavy

1035
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,060
metals and don't realize it and people

1036
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,079
there better a little bit lower in heavy

1037
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,079
metals and don't realize it

1038
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,420
might put a touch more in here we go

1039
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,420
all right next one

1040
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,920
two large leaves of kale now I got

1041
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:22,260
really large leaves of kale there's one

1042
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,099
I got much larger right there but

1043
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,099
there's one right there

1044
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,480
you'll notice that's coming out dry

1045
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,040
drier than any other machine that I've

1046
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,579
used

1047
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,760
but I've tried them all it's incredible

1048
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,560
this is the mm-1500 it's on sale

1049
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,319
20 off

1050
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,480
this is a really large

1051
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:55,339
that's a large one right there it's

1052
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,339
gonna produce more juice than

1053
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,680
someone was just asking about the juicer

1054
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,720
there's an mm-900 and mm-1500 you got

1055
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,940
the choice the 1500's got a Nutritional

1056
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,220
Center

1057
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,740
but seriously

1058
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,480
food prices are going up up they're

1059
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,520
skyrocketing which is like unbelievable

1060
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,040
I'm talking about all food animal

1061
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,780
products you know beef whatever chicken

1062
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,060
everything's going up dairy products

1063
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,160
fruits vegetables everything is going up

1064
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:25,200
I endorse these guys you got because

1065
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,940
this saves people money so that's the

1066
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,560
kill right there

1067
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,119
because it's squeezing out a lot of

1068
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,160
juice out of here and the pulp's coming

1069
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,839
out that kind of dry right there and

1070
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,640
it's cold pressed masticating where the

1071
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,440
nutrients are preserved

1072
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,720
I endorse these guys because this

1073
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,579
machine's like incredible

1074
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,260
saving people money and that makes me

1075
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:45,660
really happy if you can save people

1076
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,800
money when there's like food problems

1077
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,260
out there in the world and everything

1078
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,480
else it's amazing

1079
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,960
it's like

1080
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,960
all right

1081
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,560
two radishes

1082
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,540
our next there's one right here

1083
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:09,260
rad radish went in there all crunched up

1084
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:09,260
two radishes

1085
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,319
next one is quarter cup of fresh or

1086
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:15,319
thawed blackberries

1087
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,099
I got some frozen blackberries right

1088
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,560
here and you want to defrost them and

1089
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:27,540
I'm telling you guys that because I know

1090
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,000
that some people will they won't they'll

1091
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,800
get frozen but they won't defrost it so

1092
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,359
what happens is it doesn't juice

1093
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,880
anything out of it because it's making

1094
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,140
you're making frozen sorbet so you're

1095
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,280
what you're really doing is making a

1096
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,280
frozen sorbet somehow

1097
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,720
and in this situation

1098
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:47,460
you want to make sure you defrost those

1099
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,260
frozen fruits when you're using them in

1100
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,020
these brain shot Therapies

1101
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,640
one to two

1102
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,640
stalks of celery

1103
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,240
right there

1104
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,480
yep

1105
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,619
yep yep yep yep

1106
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,619
I'm gonna put one here too

1107
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,079
I just had to get a celery stick out of

1108
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,579
the fridge you guys

1109
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,579
have to one orange peel

1110
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,660
okay I'm gonna peel it real quick

1111
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,660
there we go

1112
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,540
now what's your notice about this juicer

1113
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,520
is it's quiet and Juice in the morning

1114
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,800
you won't wake up your family if you're

1115
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:44,240
somebody that's worried about that

1116
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,240
it's a quiet juicer

1117
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,780
the spinning basket juicers and all the

1118
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,220
other juicers all they do is throw away

1119
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,560
a lot of produce

1120
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,060
you've got to have a pretty deep wallet

1121
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,339
to keep up with juicing with those

1122
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,079
machines

1123
00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:00,260
this one right here is about saving

1124
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,260
money

1125
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,800
crispy perspective says love the juicer

1126
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,380
explanation points figuring it all out

1127
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,540
yesterday fumbling time was minimal

1128
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:15,660
totally worth the upgrade from spinning

1129
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,940
basket crispy perspective

1130
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,940
totally worth it because

1131
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,960
the amount of produce you have to run

1132
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:28,260
through those other machines is insane

1133
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,560
like you need access to like co-ops and

1134
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:33,900
like food co-ops and and produce back

1135
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,579
alleys where the produce managers were

1136
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,599
giving you lots of produce for free or

1137
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,880
something you know what I mean that's

1138
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:40,440
spoiled or something you need access to

1139
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,359
a lot of produce with those machines if

1140
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,839
you're going to juice all the time

1141
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:47,460
and this right here is squeezing out so

1142
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,700
much juice

1143
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,200
20 off and it's not like it's more

1144
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,119
expensive than anything it's not that's

1145
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,560
what's incredible two you know people

1146
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,200
are like oh well then what does it cost

1147
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,359
well that's the amazing part it's

1148
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,819
affordable for a lot of people but I see

1149
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:05,300
people say it's too expensive

1150
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:05,300
right

1151
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,079
and

1152
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:11,160
they're but they want a juicer and

1153
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,900
they're worrying about worrying about

1154
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,920
food and they're worrying about a juicer

1155
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,660
that's too expensive they don't

1156
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,640
understand that first of all it's 20 off

1157
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,800
it's on sale right now second of all

1158
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,800
it's saving people so much money

1159
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,160
they think it's too A lot of people

1160
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,780
think it's too expensive to make juice

1161
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,119
they're worried about it being too

1162
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,339
expensive to actually make it and what

1163
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,619
they don't realize is that with this

1164
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:36,000
juicer you're saving money and that's

1165
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:39,020
the incredible part right there you're

1166
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,020
actually saving money

1167
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,359
and you can give it a little time and

1168
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,619
let it go down

1169
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,839
so

1170
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:50,040
I'm going to kind of just massage this a

1171
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,960
little bit and get

1172
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,460
this comes with a nice screen on top

1173
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,380
which I love and you can just actually

1174
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,599
push all the juice through it's

1175
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:59,520
incredible when you really get down to

1176
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,619
it the amount of juice you can juice

1177
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,380
with very little

1178
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:07,200
it's it's really insane

1179
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,480
berries are a different consistency

1180
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,920
oranges are a different consistency but

1181
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,480
if you give it a little time it all ends

1182
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:13,980
up going down there and it's it's

1183
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,140
squeezing here's what people don't

1184
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,480
realize

1185
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,160
it's not about like people are like oh

1186
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,200
just make a juice really quick and then

1187
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,420
they run all this produce to make this

1188
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,040
much juice all this produce through this

1189
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,160
thing is squeezing it's got high

1190
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,020
compression it's squeezing out the juice

1191
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,460
and that is where the money's at because

1192
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,440
when you go to the store you have to buy

1193
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,060
this much more this much more of

1194
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,400
everything in this situation you're

1195
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,440
buying less and it's a cold pressed slow

1196
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,260
masticating juicer which is incredible

1197
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,900
it's still squeezing out juice

1198
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,180
Gary Pearson says the mm Omega juicers

1199
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,280
paid for themselves and that's what they

1200
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,660
do so anybody if you guys are watching

1201
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,619
this and you're like well what you sure

1202
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,240
because everybody's going to be like if

1203
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:58,079
I'm going to do the brain shot I need a

1204
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,940
juicer so um so I'm just showing you how

1205
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,660
this works

1206
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:09,059
and the warranty is 15 years plus

1207
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:10,740
powertrain 15 years and parts 15 years

1208
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,780
that's unbelievable and there's an mm

1209
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:16,140
you know call hotline number and all

1210
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:17,520
that you know and a mega juicers right

1211
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,740
put that there because I'm gonna eat

1212
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,559
that later

1213
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:25,619
Lila Collins says Omega has superb

1214
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,260
customer service I hear that a lot

1215
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:30,599
that's incredible

1216
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,619
and then what you have here is the dry

1217
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:35,460
stuff

1218
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:38,940
right you don't have a pile of wet

1219
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:41,040
sloppy pulp from trying to make a big

1220
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,380
basket of juice wet you know the whole

1221
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,540
thing it's it's insane this is like the

1222
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:48,359
difference right there

1223
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,640
47 Anderson Jay says this juicer makes

1224
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:52,920
the best orange juice and makes so much

1225
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,020
out of just a few oranges I know the

1226
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,420
reason why I say no because I love to

1227
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,300
use oranges I juice like everything in

1228
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,119
here I'll juice limes Judith Galley says

1229
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:05,339
what's the juicer brand it's a mega

1230
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:08,300
o-m-e-g-a it's a mega now here's the

1231
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:08,300
thing here right

1232
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:15,300
so in this juice this is the fungicide

1233
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:18,599
herbicide pesticide exposure shot

1234
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,280
it calls for a little bit of spirulina

1235
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:23,160
another incredible product I'm just

1236
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:27,540
going to say this okay

1237
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:30,119
this stuff is so incredible but why put

1238
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,359
your words where your mouth is man you

1239
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,940
know what I mean they don't use the

1240
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:38,160
anti-caking or bonding agents

1241
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:40,800
it's the only company

1242
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:43,440
from what I know out there

1243
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,059
right that with the Rishi powder their

1244
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,980
chaga powder the barley grass juice

1245
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,720
powder the spirulina they don't use the

1246
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,520
ant this is crazy you have to know what

1247
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,300
this is

1248
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,760
like just know what this is

1249
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,440
companies have to put an anti-caking

1250
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,359
agent that's what they all put in they

1251
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,220
just choose to do it and they don't

1252
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:04,079
disclose what it is

1253
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,280
people got their green powders and they

1254
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,260
don't realize it

1255
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,540
their powder has an anti-caking agent

1256
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,339
that's not on the list on on the bottle

1257
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,900
people have their green powders they got

1258
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:15,000
their mushroom powders they got all

1259
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,339
their different powders out there

1260
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,680
and they don't realize it there's

1261
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:21,240
anti-caking and anti-bonding agents in

1262
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,819
those powders

1263
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,960
okay only company that said uh-uh we're

1264
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:27,359
not going to do it we don't care if it

1265
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,559
gets clumpy we don't care if some of it

1266
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,059
clumps together

1267
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,559
we don't care if a little bit of it

1268
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:33,599
clumps together

1269
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,300
we're not going to put an anti-caking

1270
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,460
anti-bonding agent in our powders and

1271
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,319
then hide it from the public and not

1272
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:43,079
disclose it and that's the difference

1273
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,400
that's just one aspect of Imaging you

1274
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,980
guys know I endorse these guys because

1275
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,740

so someone can do what they get gotta do

1287
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,099
the same thing with emergy it's a mom

1288

hard work they put into it they're like

1292

we're not going to use the anti-bonding

1293
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,839
agents anti-caking agents we're not

1294
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,280

00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,099
garbage we're not going to do any of

1297
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:34,260
that and they're the only ones that have

1298
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:36,720
said that and they work their butt off

1299
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,480
and they're passionate every day about

1300
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,520
making sure people have the best stuff

1301
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,839

but it's what it is is though it's not

1343
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,020
about the greed aspect

1344
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,780

1351
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,040

1352
00:56:38,339 --> 00:56:43,020
agencies confront me and said say all

1353
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,599

1358
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:54,619
chronically sick chronically ill you

1359
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,619
think they want to hear a commercial

1360
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,800
they want answers

1361
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:03,800
same way I don't sell programs I don't

1362
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,059
