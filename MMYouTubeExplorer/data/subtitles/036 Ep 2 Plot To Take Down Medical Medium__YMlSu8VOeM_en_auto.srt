1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,399
I have a guest with me today she

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,519
uncovered a plot by a group of Rivals to

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:13,320
take down medical medium and our

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:17,960
community to be safe she chose to record

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,080
the calls legally and they were caught

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,439
red-handed we're talking about the plot

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,960
a group of Rivals planned in a

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,039
premeditative way to take down medical

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,480
medium and the community make it go away

10
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,680
take it all down but they got caught

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,879
caught

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,399
red-handed they got found out if they

13
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,879
didn't no one would be the wiser never

14
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,840
before has this ever happened in a

15
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,480
health and wellness space when you

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,920
listen to the plot your jaw may hit the

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,160

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,760
get ready for the next round of the

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,760
plotter

down take the scale multiple steps down

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,119
step one in this process there's no

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,759
coming back from that when I just hear

26
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:20,240
those again and the intentions behind

27
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,960
them I mean you I'm still in shock first

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,560
of all but you can feel the negative

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,280
energy and the sense of their goals and

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,720
the more recordings we hear the more is

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,560
uncovered

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,159
it's bone chilling back with me on the

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,040
medical medium podcast is Amber vakaro

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,240
who the medical medium Community is

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,759
calling our hero right now I'm honored

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,479
to have you here Amber today we're going

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,719
to go through some more recordings that

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,920
were obtained legally and of these

39
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,000
Anonymous sources who are actually

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,840
plotting the takedown of the medical

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,360
medium and the medical medium community

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,039
and when I say that I mean I mean I I

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,200
just can't believe what they were doing

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,840
but the facts are there the

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,160
information's there and the recordings

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,640
are there

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,640
undeniable and it's just it's just

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,879
unbelievable for the people who haven't

49
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,080
heard the last episode if you can and

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:24,280
you have a moment try to catch up and

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,160
listen to 35 episode 35 part one plot to

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,239
take down the medical medium Amber first

53
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,480
can you give us a little recap on some

54
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,480
of your re recordings from the last

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,200
episode of course in part one we talked

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,239
about how there was an attempt to

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,159
indoctrinate me into a group a group of

58
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,120
people with health and wellness

59
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,280
businesses that have plotted a

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,599
premeditated plan to go to a journalist

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,519
at a mainstream media outlet with a

62
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,000
manipulated story that would if all went

63
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,560
according to their plan caused so much

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,080
upset that the medical medium Community

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,760
would would all come crashing down and

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,000
in the process they're exploiting a

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,720
deceased person shaping a story that

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,440
they want to the way that they want to

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,720
spin it leaving out facts and content

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,400
cherry-picking evidence that suits a

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
preferred narrative with a plan of

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,480
publishing additional

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,400
articles and ultimately to sell a

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,879
negative documentary and how we talked

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,480
about how I obtained legal recordings of

76
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:32,840
these phone conversations

77
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,280
versus like when the the movie came out

78
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,159
or the do or the Netflix thing came out

79
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,080
like this is this going to

80
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,439
happen holy

81
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
 there's going to be a documentary

82
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,760
about it all that's our vision I mean

83
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,560
it's not we first you have to publish

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,840
the article and then once the article is

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,760
published then people start bidding on

86
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,319
the piece the intention and action I had

87
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,640
is that it's going h a Netflix series

88
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,560
like bad vegan will be made about

89
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,319
Anthony and it will be a hit

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,400
because what he pulled off is

91
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,400
unbelievable I mean and the celebrity

92
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,320
angle like this thing this Netflix

93
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,280
version is gonna go boners I I connected

94
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,840
him with a lot of people to it he really

95
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,880
appreciated Ash and I and then just gave

96
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,120
him a lot of direction for this piece we

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,080
gave him a lot of clarity sort of like

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,680
he he's having a hard time wrapping his

99
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,080
head around a lot of it had to like

100
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,680
really hammer his head like what's going

101
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,639
on and like explain the details and

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,560
point him towards this point him towards

103
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:43,280
that but I I was upset I said like he

104
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,720
you are scared you're scared like what's

105
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,080
going on what's the delay like you you

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,280
have everything it's on the

107
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,440
phone like you have all this stuff like

108
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,080
what more do you need and then I

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,840
basically threaten I will definitely

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,880
take responsibility for one I've been

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,039
one of the people that's been pushing

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,720
for this uh if you want to take the the

113
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,240
list of people of why this article's

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,479
coming out and why it's coming out in a

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,639
um mainstream publication is number one

116
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,400
Ash is the number one responsible I

117
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,400
would be number two be number three

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,520
would be number four it was us four who

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,199
like decided this needs to

120
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,360
happen so this is what this group of

121
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:25,880
plotters did to sell a story to sell

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,639
their narrative they had to hammer it

123
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,000
into the head of a journalist Point him

124
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,479
here and point him there

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,840
and ultimately threaten him and today

126
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,639
I'm going to unpack more of the content

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,199
from the calls that I had with these

128
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,880
plotters as part of the attempt that

129
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
they had to recruit

130
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,360
me that really speaks to a serious lack

131
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,080
of credibility in each of them as

132
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,880
sources

133
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,479
and had given me seeds she planted seeds

134
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,199
that I had not heard when I saw the

135
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,639
documentary and then when I saw the

136
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,960
documentary and I flipped that that's

137
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,440
when I started collecting way more

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,759
information I went back to I asked for

139
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,759
more first of all I want to point out

140
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,599
here that this plotter is stating in his

141
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,319
own words that what ultimately turn what

142
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,840
turned him against medical medium wasn't

143
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,240
a story it wasn't a piece of information

144
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,520
about a deceased person it was him

145
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,880
watching a documentary that a co-plot

146
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,599
husband helped to create which made him

147
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,280
think to himself that could be Anthony

148
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,080
that was his light bulb

149
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,960
moment next he says he turned to a

150
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,280
source that he deems as being reliable

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,160
who made him so confident that medical

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,080
medium was problematic that he became

153
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,680
the number two instigator of this entire

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,680
takedown

155
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,440
plot Jes is like a CIA agent I mean this

156
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,840
and she'll be happy to talk to you Amber

157
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,560
you can talk to anybody you want in this

158
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,199
story but she like went and found

159
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:07,240
pictures of him in his high school

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,240
yearbook can I hear that one

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,599
again jokes is like a CIA agent I mean

162
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
this and she'll be happy to talk to you

163
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,000
am you can talk to anybody you want in

164
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,879
this story but she like went and found

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,360
pictures of him in his high school

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,879
yearbook so that sounds like the

167
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,000
plotters or are looking for anything

168
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,240
they can find I guess they're in my

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,560
yearbook looking for

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,960
pictures and I heard CIA

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,680
agent so I guess there must be something

172
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,680
these plotters are doing so and when I

173
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,120
even think back to the other Clips you

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,720
you played for us there were four people

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,840
they had like a ranking system so it was

176
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,080
like 1 2 3

177
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
4 and

178
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,919
they

179
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:09,000
brought this plot to the media company I

180
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:14,639
what it looks like too through all of

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,479
that and it was inspired by a

182
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,599
husband who actually does

183
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:25,599
cinematography meaning that was

184
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:28,240
involved and I'm just so blown away in a

185
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,039
sense where I'm I'm actually in

186
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,959
shock in shock so but really I was just

187
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,760
a seeker of Truth like you

188
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:39,320
are I just wanted to know the truth so I

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,919
was surprised he talked to me on the

190
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,080
phone and we talked for a good long time

191
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,480
but one of the stories he told me I have

192
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,040
no idea why I don't remember why our

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,640
conversation went here but I think this

194
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,680
is the underlying thing for Anthony all

195
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:57,000
the time is that

196
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,120
um I think in his childhood growing up

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,640
in in Maine mhm and it's a it's a

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:09,120
different world um especially back then

199
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,279
um and he probably didn't fit in I think

200
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,480
the kids picked on him a lot he was

201
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,360
mentioning stuff that how the boys um

202
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,040
when he was he had a little job after

203
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,519
work after school like a little work job

204
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,360
and he was walking home and they set up

205
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,360
was winter time and they set up a a

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,279
snow um trap I what to call it whereas

207
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,360
when he walked by a certain spot they

208
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,800
all bombarded him with

209
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,760
snowballs and he's still telling the

210
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,279
story to this day to

211
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,720
me so apparently it hurt him a lot both

212
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,640
physically and mentally I think he was

213
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,600
like bloody and bleeding and you know

214
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,680
you have to go home and explain to your

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,640
mom

216
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,360
why why you're all beat up but I think

217
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,600
that was a common thing the kids were

218
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,760
mean to him

219
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,000
so

220
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,920
um I don't know know maybe he snapped I

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,040
don't know he just has this strong will

222
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,839
to feel important that's what I say to

223
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,920
kind of get back at everyone you know to

224
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,640
be something really special so here we

225
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,720
are again this is this is somebody who

226
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,480
this group is relying on for so-called

227
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,079
factual information that ultimately the

228
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
journalist ends up relying on for

229
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,360
factual information and and we have

230
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
again the truth Seeker phrase truth

231
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,399
Seeker truth seeker and I want to talk

232
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,079
about this so-called truth Anthony is

233
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,959
this is this a story that you shared

234
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,079
with this

235
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:41,240
woman I haven't experienced a childhood

236
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:44,160
experience like that so I'm you know

237
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,800
confused about that that seems like the

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,200
story from the movie Elf where buddy and

239
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Michael were in Central Park and they

240
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,680
got attacked by some kids and some

241
00:10:51,800 --> 00:11:00,160
bullies that's what it reminds me

242
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,440
of ow son of a n

243
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,440
[Music]

244
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
cracker

245
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,880
run and he's still telling the story to

246
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,200
this day to me so if I hear that clip

247
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,120
correctly that

248
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,360
recording she's saying I'm still telling

249
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:28,600
that same snowball fight story today or

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,120
maybe the other day or it sounds like

251
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,160
now I'm still telling that person the

252
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,920
story but I haven't talked to this

253
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,200
person in

254
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,519
years

255
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,440
um I don't know maybe he snapped I don't

256
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,360
know he just has this strong will to

257
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,120
feel important and that's what I say to

258
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,760
kind of get back at everyone you know to

259
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,959
be something really special and I really

260
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,200
don't think it's

261
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,440
spirit I think he I think he has a

262
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,040
mental disorder actually because there's

263
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,839
so many things things that are signals

264
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,560
for

265
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,000
that maybe he really does think he hears

266
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,920
voices you know there's a lot of PE

267
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,839
people with schizophrenia out there and

268
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,800
they think they hear voices as well and

269
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,720
not necessarily bad

270
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,079
ones basically this woman doesn't

271
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,920
believe in your gift which is fine right

272
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,839
to each their own but she's filling in

273
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,920
that Gap by diagnosing you as if she's a

274
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,199
psychiatrist when she's not based on

275
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,560
stories that you never actually told

276
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,480
her and one major theme that I observe

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,920
from these recordings is that several

278
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,320
people in this group weaponize the fact

279
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,399
that they've ever spoken to you

280
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,320
personally at all even if you were not

281
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,320
actually close to them in reality and

282
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,199
they use it as leverage to position

283
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,800
themselves as people who have Insider

284
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,199
information to recruit others and as a

285
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,959
marker of credibility to say whatever

286
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,800
they want about you in general so we

287
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,680
know talk to a lot of people

288
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,839
um and gathered all kinds of information

289
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,320
he has a ton

290
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,160
from here this plotter is saying that

291
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,760
the journalist that they sought out for

292
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,320
this mainstream media article got a ton

293
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,079
of his information from this

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,240
woman and I'm not exactly sure that she

295
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,399
sounds like a reliable source to say the

296
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,320
least you don't know like when he woke

297
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,000
up from the coma did like was he did

298
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,160
does he is he mentally Disturbed does he

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,680
think he hears a voice um I mean are

300
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,160
these people who do like crazy

301
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,560
sacrifices of like I don't even know who

302
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,199
knows like like like are they acting

303
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
like they're Christian but they're

304
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:47,040
really killing little baby like I don't

305
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,880
 know I it's

306
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,639
crazy so this guy is plotting a plan

307
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,120
with a group of people a group of

308
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:01,160
plotters they've taken it to a major

309
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,800
mainstream media

310
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,720
outlet and at the same time they're

311
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,959
plotting they're associating me with

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:15,160
sacrificing babies or killing

313
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,160
babies while they're being anonymous

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
sources

315
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,480
and yeah this is this is amazing

316
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,000
actually but there's like no one more

317
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
trustworthy than Robbie so I know that

318
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,639
whatever he shared with you is like

319
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,160
spoton can we hear that one again but

320
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,519
there's like no one more trustworthy

321
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:41,040
than Robbie so I know that whatever he

322
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:43,279
shared with you is like spot on the most

323
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,880
trustworthy that was really interesting

324
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,839
to me is that what we're calling someone

325
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,120
who's making up horrifying allegations

326
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,639
of sacrificing and killing

327
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,320
babies who completely hid this Sinister

328
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,399
plot from me for over a year and who

329
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,279
plotted behind your back Anthony and

330
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:10,160
behind everyone's back well I'm so glad

331
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,759

332
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,079
least I don't know about good but at

333
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,720
least

334
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,920
honest got a mix but at least we're

335
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,040
trying to be honest about it is it

336
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,519
possible to hear that one again well I'm

337
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,320
so glad

338
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,920
you're on the team of the good guys at

339
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,279
least I don't know about good but at

340
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,399
least honest

341
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,519
got a mix but at least we're trying to

342
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,959
be honest about it throughout these

343
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,639
recordings the plotters contradict

344
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:45,360
themselves a lot like this here it's at

345
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:48,199
first at first it's we're the good guys

346
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,800
and then well I don't know about good

347
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:54,440
but at least honest and then she says

348
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,560
it's well we're trying to be

349
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,759
honest this is who was named as the

350
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,600
number one source

351
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,399
and she's here contradicting herself

352
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,759
again and again as she's referring to

353
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,399
herself and her fellow colluders Anthony

354
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,480
that's not even his real name by the way

355
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,319
I'm not sure if you know that it's not

356
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:18,360
um it's not no it's not what is

357
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:21,040
it um I don't even know I don't care

358
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,600
anymore that's not his real name

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,480
though this plotter was so confident in

360
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,759
the negative things that she was saying

361
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,480
so confident in saying that Anthony is

362
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,079
not your real name and yet she doesn't

363
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,959
actually know what it is she doesn't

364
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:38,399
know she doesn't care it's like she

365
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,360
can't even be bothered to get her

366
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,920
information straight before spreading

367
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,399
rumors Anthony that's not even his real

368
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,560
name by the way I'm not sure if you know

369
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,519
that it's not um it's not no it's not

370
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,519
what is

371
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:57,040
it um I don't even know I don't care

372
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,240
anymore that's not his real name though

373
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,199
okay so that's not my real name I'm

374
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,520
hearing the in interesting part is the

375
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,039
person doesn't even care to even know

376
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,000
but this person is a source that's

377
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:14,720
supposed to be relied upon when I was

378
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,839
growing up no one can pronounce my last

379
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,720
name right and so my school

380
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,120
teachers and other people would call me

381
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,240
Anthony William and Anthony William is

382
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,720
my legal name that is my real name my

383
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,799
real name is Anthony and so when I hear

384
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,640
that it sounds like my name Anthony is

385
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,280
not even my real name so if that rumor

386
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,400
is going around I could see people being

387
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,080
like whoa that's not even his real name

388
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,760
but it's Anthony William that's my real

389
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,960
name and that's what I go by and so and

390
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,960
there's nothing wrong with trying to

391
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,919
maintain a little bit of privacy too but

392
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,520
my name is not hidden by any means my

393
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,520
last name's not hidden at all it's easy

394
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,360
to find it's not as if it's being hidden

395
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,520
but throughout my life my family has

396
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,400
called me Anthony William my mom calls

397
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,440
me Anthony William even up to this point

398
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,080
now today and that is my legal name and

399
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,880
Anthony is my first legal name

400
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,880
too throughout these recordings I found

401
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,640
that this group often conflated privacy

402
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,840
with dishonesty they're acting like

403
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,320
you're deceiving people when Anthony

404
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,679
William is your actual legal first name

405
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,679
and middle name your last name is out

406
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,120
there like you said you're not hiding it

407
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:43,559
there's nothing wrong with wanting to

408
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,080
maintain some privacy meanwhile these

409
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,000
plotters didn't want anyone to know what

410
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,880
they've been up to and what they've been

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,159
doing I'm not I'm not afraid of

412
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,080
Anthony um I'm being strategic if I

413
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:57,600
wanted I mean I thought about when I

414
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,200
talked well do you want to be off the

415
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,640
record on back I'm like what do you want

416
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,960
to do here and the truth is I I'm I

417
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,480
would be happy to be on the record and

418
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
just like say Robbie said that but the

419
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,440
the Strategic reason behind that that's

420
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,520
not smart because I'm I have a different

421
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,280
I'm I'm building something different

422
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,640
with my life and I don't want to be

423
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,559
associated with with this in any way

424
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,960
shape or form I want to just completely

425
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,799
distance myself and be gone I will not

426
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,240
be in the documentary my name will not

427
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:32,520
be in the article I'm I'm just

428
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,120
leaving that's tragic in so many ways so

429
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,919
I'm speechless in the moment want to

430
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:41,320
hear that because what that plotter is

431
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,280
doing is telling a journalist whatever

432
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,600
they want to tell him going

433
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,880
Anonymous the person's not afraid of me

434
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,400
the person just doesn't want to be

435
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,400
involved at any level after the

436
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,760
basically the bomb is

437
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,200
dropped and and a documentary happens

438
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,760
because that's part of the plotter plan

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,840
altogether but this person works in the

440
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,360
health

441
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,760
space is a business

442
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,039
owner or Works in in business in the

443
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,559
health

444
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:16,120
space

445
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:20,039
and here that person is

446
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,960
basically plotting to plan or

447
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,120
strategically plotting to plan the

448
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,240
takeown of medical medium and the

449
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,880
community the journalist is allow o it

450
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,200
that's a whole another

451
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,840
story and to unpack this I mean I could

452
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,120
sit here we can sit here and unpack this

453
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,960
for a long time but I know we have to

454
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,720
move on there's so much more but this is

455
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,080
a person working in the health space

456
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,559
competitor rival whatever you want to

457
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,880
say a plotter with a group of

458
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,120
people directing a

459
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,960
journalist staying Anonymous going on

460
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,440
their merry way to keep doing what

461
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,080
they're doing in the house space in the

462
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,679
health field not having their name

463
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,640
attached to anything and they're not

464
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,559
afraid of me at the same time and all

465
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,960
this is perfectly fine to the

466
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,320
journalist perfectly fine obviously to

467
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,799
the media

468
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,720
company I find it

469
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,840
despicable great like he's really he's

470
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,080
really easygoing and if you say to him

471
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,400
like I want to talk on

472
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,799
background um or I want to talk off the

473
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Record or however you want to do it if

474
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,760
you say I don't want you to quote

475
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,760
or say you like you know put my name

476
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,360
anywhere he's happy to do that and he's

477
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,760
also like he change your name if you

478
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
want you know a particular statement to

479
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,240
be said but you want to use a different

480
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,720
name you know just make sure you are

481
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,720
upfront

482
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,120
about anonymity you know do you want

483
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,799
your name mentioned or not be sure you

484
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,039
say clearly what you

485
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:02,480
want um and on my recommendation for

486
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,400
that you know what that is is to not

487
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,840
don't go there um you know you don't

488
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,880
want to be sued for any kind of

489
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,559
defamation of

490
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,559
character so on these recordings I'm

491
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,480
pretty sure that what is being described

492
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:22,520
here is not how real journalism is

493
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,919
supposed to be conducted and one of

494
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,000
these plotters is clearly aware that

495
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
what she's saying is most likely

496
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,200
defamatory it's like she's going to go

497
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,520
after you but she's not going to put her

498
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,400
name behind it it sounds like she's not

499
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,760
confident in what she's saying and

500
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,440
concerned that what she's saying might

501
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,760
not be true and some of these sources

502
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,720
won't put their names behind their

503
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,400
statements because they admittedly don't

504
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,600
completely stand behind their statements

505
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,600
so if he had if he had picked something

506
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,400
out that was like yes like I stand by

507
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,760
that statement like 1,000% every single

508
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,279
moment of my life like I'd be I would

509
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,480
have been like yeah you can use my name

510
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:05,200
but the the things that he asked me to

511
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:09,480
go on record were like not things that

512
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I um I was just like I don't I mean I

513
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,000
said that that's not really

514
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,679
like something that I feel like super

515
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,080
strongly about it feels important to

516
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,840
have my name behind it so I ended up

517
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,960
saying no and he was very kind about it

518
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,760
I mean he asked me to explain why and I

519
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
did but he didn't like push me about it

520
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,440
at all

521
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,720
so that's a major red flag to me I think

522
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
that that sounds like something the

523
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,080
journalist something that the journalist

524
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,880
should have pushed her on if she doesn't

525
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,120
feel comfortable with what she said she

526
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,559
shouldn't have it in print the fact that

527
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,000
the journalist knows that she doesn't

528
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:49,320
even fully stand behind what she said to

529
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,520
me that shouldn't even go in an article

530
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,400
then I really don't even know what to

531
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,039
say about this when you unpack this one

532
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,200
the person doesn't feel comfortable

533
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:03,720
standing behind their statement that

534
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:06,039
alone right and then the person isn't

535
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,120
even

536
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:14,679
1,000% uh confident the statement is not

537
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,440
just stand bable but can even be seen

538
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,279
the person wants to be anonymous in the

539
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,039
back end but that but the yet isn't

540
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:24,279
standing behind the statements doesn't

541
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:26,919
want them out front on

542
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:28,799
record journalist seems to be fine with

543
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:31,760
it I mean it just seems like a

544
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,520
weaponization of some kind it's almost

545
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,600
like just fit anything in oh you want to

546
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,880
be in the backend then fine you don't

547
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,240
have to stand behind these comments

548
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,679
we'll put them in the

549
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,880
article but don't worry we won't same

550
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,000
your say your name maybe they'll even

551
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,919
change a name of course put a fake name

552
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,080
it's a type of

553
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,240
wordsmithing for

554
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,120
sure it and they do this I think to make

555
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,919
the reader feel any way they want them

556
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,320
to

557
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,320
feel and they kind of put what they want

558
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,880
to put in even if the person isn't

559
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,760
standing behind

560
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,240
it

561
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,159
and this should be the bigger story

562
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,880
because this

563
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,880
is yeah this is

564
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,399
unconscious

565
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,600
yeah it's it's not a natural situation

566
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,520
it's not a natural story it seems as

567
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,880
though these people don't know much of

568
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,080
the story or they don't feel comfortable

569
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,080
standing by their own statements and

570
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,640
there's some misinformation mixed in and

571
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,320
then you've got a journalist listening

572
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,399
is that this stuff is all you know real

573
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:46,039
it's it's kind of like a favoring of the

574
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:49,039
plotted plan and it's it's that falls in

575
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:51,080
the line of I mean some character

576
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,799
assassination territory it's like you

577
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,880
can keep you can take sources that are

578
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,880
filled with misinformation and then you

579
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
can weaponize it like you said you can

580
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,799
slip in a factor or two somewhere around

581
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,240
it and then you make it as if it's law

582
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,159
or complete truth and uh it's really

583
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,640
interesting it's it's it seems like it's

584
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,760
a way of telling the story the way that

585
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,559
they want the reader to read it and so

586
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,880
obviously I had some questions about all

587
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,559
of this as I was listening to to this

588
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,440
group of individuals I was trying to

589
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,640
figure it all out I really truly was not

590
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,559
asking a huge amount of questions I was

591
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,000
mostly just trying to hear these people

592
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,120
out as you can hear in the recordings

593
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,720
that we're sharing

594
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,480
but it was interesting to me that

595
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,279
throughout this process they quickly

596
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,080
became uncomfortable with me asking

597
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,159
questions at all you might want to stop

598
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
talking to some to people at some point

599
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,960
I mean I can't imagine you you don't

600
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,080
have enough information by now I mean

601
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,200
again I don't know how much more you

602
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,679
need to know Amber but yeah

603
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,960
um obviously go ahead I'm just saying

604
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,480
like I'm just looking out for you like I

605
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,520
guess my question is how long do you

606
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,120
want to stay in the state I think

607
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,080
Robbie's kind of frustrated with me

608
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,760
because I've been asking questions and

609
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,919
it's for me

610
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,320
too this group of plotters feels so

611
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:11,080
strongly about you being so problematic

612
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,880
that they have taken it this far so as

613
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,600
to plot to take you down to take the

614
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,159
community down yet they don't even know

615
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,279
medical medium information that well

616
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,679
you've probably read the books more

617
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,080
thoroughly than I than I

618
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:27,039
have well the first one I actually

619
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,960
really liked the first very first one

620
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,240
that came up out it was kind of real

621
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,120
except for the stories I kind of skipped

622
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,120
over those but you know all the

623
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,320
protocols and stuff were very helpful

624
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,840
and the information seems

625
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,960
sincere

626
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,559
um whether it's right or not I don't

627
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,880
know but it certainly was interesting

628
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,120
and I had never heard of what he was

629
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,440
talking about before I met him so I am

630
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,159
grateful for that because I think what

631
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,120
he's mentioning is very

632
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:58,120
real This Woman This plotter is

633
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,000
admitting that the information is

634
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:04,960
helpful she's also saying that she

635
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,360
skimmed through it so she didn't really

636
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
study the book she didn't really study

637
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,880
the information and then at the same

638
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,200
time she was telling me that

639
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,600
practitioners come to her to learn from

640
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,480
her all the time and she was suggesting

641
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,760
that I could come to her for

642
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,799
practitioner support and

643
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,200
education are there people who are

644
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,120
applying medical medium information

645
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,120
still who call you and ask for advice

646
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,559
absolutely yeah that's mostly what

647
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,799
I have I have very few clients that

648
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,919
found me outside of medical medium and

649
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:38,320
you know word of mouth is really

650
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,640
big um you know and when somebody

651
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,279
mentions you on social media yeah you

652
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,399
know you well you're probably there

653
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,200
right now with getting recommendations

654
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,760
and people love Word of Mouth from

655
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,519
others or being helped yeah yeah but

656
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,080
also so practitioners who are applying

657
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,159
medical medium information will ask you

658
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,519
for

659
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,559
advice oh yeah yeah yeah this plotter is

660
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:06,519
positioning herself as an authority as a

661
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,559
health practitioner when it seems as

662
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:11,240
though she doesn't even really know

663
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,440
medical medium information she doesn't

664
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,960
believe in spirit it sounds like she

665
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,039
really only read the first book it

666
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,320
sounds like she skimmed it at best there

667
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:28,960
are eight books plus a ton of other

668
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:31,559
resources if food were the only key to

669
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
healing which is what Anthony implies

670
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:37,519
really

671
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,880
um so but I

672
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,919
mean I mean do you do you ever hear

673
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,399
Anthony talk about anything other than

674
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:48,279
what to eat not not a lot right I mean

675
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,279
he does get into some spiritual stuff

676
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,760
and things but not

677
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:57,399
really yeah I mean he had talked about

678
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,360
he's got like the Angels he's got the

679
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,320
the soul healing techniques he's got in

680
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,399
the healing path resource he talked

681
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,840
about which I think that like that

682
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,279
doesn't that's something that nobody

683
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,440
really comes across anymore he talked

684
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,640
about the importance of like exercise

685
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,640
and sunlight and and all of those other

686
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,360
sorts of things that's good yeah I have

687
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
he the healing path but not for a really

688
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,320
long time

689
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,440
yeah well that's right he did mention

690
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,240
some of that yeah I don't know he really

691
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,799
focuses on food though

692
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,159
now

693
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,919
so here I wasn't going to I wasn't going

694
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,840
to go into explaining more I wasn't

695
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,120
about to try to give this woman a lesson

696
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,399
on how all of the books and how all of

697
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,960
the resources are about so much more

698
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:47,120
than just how to eat I wanted to see

699
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,519
what she knew and it became really clear

700
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,000
to me that this group again does not

701
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,320
really understand medical medium

702
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,200
information for what it is and yet their

703
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,840
sources they feel so strongly about you

704
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,720
and the information being problematic in

705
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,679
some way shape or form yet um they admit

706
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,399
to applying it in their own lives

707
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,240
explicitly without citing The Source

708
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,880
maybe you can still take that following

709
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,120
and just you know do Your Own Thing

710
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,080
aside from medical medium you know not

711
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,120
without like like Robbie said without

712
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,760
mentioning him but still uh teach people

713
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,840
what you've learned and what you what

714
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,399
you practice yourself and what works for

715
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,320
you and kind of work on it from that

716
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,039
perspective since you have a already you

717
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,399
could now do I when I talk to people

718
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,480
about health and wellbeing use a million

719
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,440
things that I've learned from him 100% I

720
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,279
mean getting this information out in the

721
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,639
world he shouldn't care who gets credit

722
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:47,559
for it I don't know any healer any real

723
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,320
healer that wants to have credit for

724
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:52,760
things and trust me you didn't you know

725
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,720
you you didn't need to credit Anthony

726
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,480
for what you've learned and you can do

727
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,600
that without ever using the word medical

728
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,960
medium or Anthony William you know here

729
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,320
this group is coaching me on how to not

730
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,320
site the

731
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,960
information they're coaching me on how

732
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,200
to plagiarize the

733
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,360
information unlike them I site the

734
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,279
source and I always will because it's

735
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,880
about

736
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:22,679
integrity it's about caring about other

737
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,360
people it's about people needing to heal

738
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,000
citing the source is about respect not

739
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,279
citing The Source ends up in and people

740
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,480
putting their own spin on it even if

741
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,919
they don't mean to it gets tainted right

742
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,320
by human interference the information

743
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,639
gets changed and further distorted as it

744
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,039
gets passed down the line becoming

745
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:46,039
something else entirely like a game of

746
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,960
telephone where no one can fully get

747
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:53,080
what they need to heal and you know it

748
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,480
just it makes me question the level of

749
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,159
compassion that this group has for

750
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,159
others citing the source is not about

751
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,279
Anthony it's not about you Anthony it's

752
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,720
not about you seeking notoriety in any

753
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:06,720
way shape or form I know that it it

754
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,559
comes from a place of deeply caring

755
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,559
about people and people having access to

756
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:15,679
the original pure information which just

757
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,279
so happens to be free you can access it

758
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,279
all for free so that the people who are

759
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,519
struggling and suffering can take it as

760
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,679
far as they need to go this group they

761
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,480
want to Brand themselves they want to be

762
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,760
somebody they all have businesses in the

763
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,840
wellness space they're trying to

764
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,159
convince me to have no

765
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,399
Integrity they're essentially saying

766
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:42,559
that all of the copyrighted original

767
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,399
information is free

768
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,639
game they want rights to that they feel

769
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,399
entitled to that they feel entitled to

770
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,600
continue on with their

771
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:58,760
brands meanwhile they want a postm

772
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,760
medical medium era they want it all down

773
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,559
they want everyone to stop mentioning

774
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,279
medical medium at

775
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,839
all these people with these intentions

776
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:12,440
are the main sources behind this plot

777
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,000
and this article they're plagiarized

778
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:17,359
from other books who were his mentors

779
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,599
before him like yeah everybody knows

780
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,599
that apples have X vitamins and Z

781
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:27,119
vitamins and his information is very

782
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,919
very very basic vitamins in an apple is

783
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,399
interesting because the medical medium

784
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,280
information the books they really don't

785
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,079
talk much about vitamins that's actually

786
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,040
what everybody else does out there

787
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,359
because that's essentially as as far as

788
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,919
science and research goes and I know

789
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,000
that you and I Anthony could talk for

790
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,399
hours about what makes medical medium

791
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,159
information completely unique and

792
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:50,000
original um it's quite an insult to

793
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,599
oversimplify the information like that

794
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,200
and to try to discredit how unlike

795
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,960
anything else that's out there that's

796
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,760
ever been done before in history his it

797
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:04,520
is and whether people want to admit that

798
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:07,240
or not it's true and then we've got this

799
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,640
plotter who's accusing you of

800
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,520
plagiarizing

801
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,200
information it's a serious accusation so

802
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,440
when I think about that and I see what

803
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,119
the plot are saying that's a serious

804
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,440
accusation first of all my publisher

805
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,079
would never let one of the medical

806
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,040
medium books out the door if it was

807
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,760
plagiarized on any level

808
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,520
they have a lot of

809
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,480
editors they uh purposely look for

810
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,640
things like that they can't just let the

811
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,680
book go out because these books are

812
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,440
symptoms and conditions and a lot of

813
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,839
intricate information about the body all

814
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,560
that stuff has to be cited from studies

815
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,680
and places of origin that could be like

816
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,960
medical clinics um articles that are out

817
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,880
there from doctors it all has to be

818
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,560
cited it can't just be thrown into a

819
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,240
medical medium book and then sent out

820
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,160
the door by the publisher so there's no

821
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,960
such thing as plagiarizing in these

822
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,640
books and these books would have to site

823
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,280
every single thing everywhere out there

824
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,040
the publisher wouldn't have it in any

825
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,800
other way so yeah so that that

826
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,380
accusation is ridiculous he's very he's

827
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,720
very smart and

828
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,480
[Music]

829
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,280
um yeah probably has some kind of

830
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,640
personality disorder potentially

831
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,760
narcissism

832
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,319
and I I don't know what else I found

833
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,359
that to be a really interesting

834
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,000
assessment coming from a group of

835
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,800
individuals that refers to themselves as

836
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,040
Elite but I'm letting you know

837
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,560
like we are an elite group of people

838
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,760
we're we're in in Elite category you

839
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,920
know I want to play this clip again

840
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,560
again in a minute because recently one

841
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,119
of these plotters claimed that nobody

842
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,040
ever they tried to claim that nobody

843
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,200
ever referred to themselves as Elites

844
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,240
and I want to display that I'm not

845
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,560
putting words in these people's mouths

846
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,200
these are actually things that were said

847
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,040
by them on these recordings I also want

848
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,440
to point out the fact that you Anthony

849
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,359
have never referred to yourself as Elite

850
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,040
you've never referred to yourself as

851
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,280
being above anyone or anything of the

852
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,680
like there's this really twisted Dynamic

853
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
with this group where it's like

854
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,240
everything it seems like everything that

855
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,119
they're accusing you of is actually what

856
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,960
they're doing and how they

857
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:44,200
are but I'm letting you know

858
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,880
like we are an elite group of people

859
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,760
we're we're in in Elite category you

860
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,319
know and by the way Ash do need to work

861
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,560
Ash has ever ever the woman is she had

862
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:01,440
family money a lot of it yeah you know

863
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,480
private plus did I hear that correctly

864
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,520
can I hear that back that clip and by

865
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,119
the way Ash didn't need to work Ash has

866
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,000
ever ever the woman is she had family

867
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,680
money a lot of it yeah you know private

868
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,119
jet and

869
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,640
plus so basically they're saying they're

870
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,359
an elite

871
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,599
group you've shown the all the

872
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,119
recordings so far or a fraction of them

873
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,920
really from what you said you have but

874
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,079
you showed recordings showing that

875
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,240
they're plotting this plan they went to

876
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:42,280
the media company mainstream media

877
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:46,160
outlet they are strategic about

878
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:48,280
it and they even have a ranking system

879
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,960
like the number one person involved

880
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,119
number two number three number four and

881
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,079
now I hear one of the people has a

882
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:58,200
private

883
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,319
jet they don't have to work or work for

884
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,040
a

885
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:05,079
living and they have what seems to be

886
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,240
lots of family

887
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:11,800
wealth and I don't have a private jet I

888
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,880
have to work for a living I have to work

889
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,880
to make sure I could bring this

890
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,520
information to everyone to the

891
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,079
public and there's no pay

892
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,560
walls and there's no programs nothing

893
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,079
like

894
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,920
that of course I don't mind when people

895
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,480
mon their websites or do what they want

896
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,760
to do with their businesses but I don't

897
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,359
monetize my website like other people

898
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,760
do

899
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:42,040
and meanwhile this person has a private

900
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,359
jet lots of wealth seems to be the

901
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:48,079
number one plotter from what it looks

902
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:49,839
like with the list and ranking

903
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,240
system

904
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,880
and yeah I mean I'm speechless really um

905
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,240
I come from the working class that's

906
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:02,720
where I come from from but apparently

907
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,079
this is an elite group they're saying

908
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,880
that in in these

909
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:09,359
recordings

910
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,800
um so yeah and knowing that these

911
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,520
plotters are

912
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:17,040
actually looking to get that documentary

913
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,720
together negative documentary all of it

914
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,480
plus the article and then when you look

915
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,440
at the plotters and the information they

916
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,880
don't even care to even want to know

917
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,040
what my name

918
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,359
is but yet my fate is in their

919
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:35,839
hands and the community's Fate is in

920
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:39,599
their hands of this plot it's really

921
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,200
interesting yeah so let's let this group

922
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,119
speak for themselves more about their

923
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,400
plot I mean when you think about this

924
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,480
from a journalist perspective this piece

925
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,040
is unfuckingbelievable I mean this is

926
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,880
this is a journalist dream I mean you

927
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,319
you want I mean the celebrities the

928
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,520
number of books

929
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,560
sold yeah it is awful and that's why

930
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,280
this there's an article coming out about

931
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,319
him I don't know if you know anything

932
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,480
about that it's not a good one y I would

933
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,359
not want to be on that train when that

934
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,520
article comes out just saying I think

935
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,680
there's there's a lot coming is what I

936
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,920
think which is why it's really good that

937
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:23,240
they're telling them now yeah we're

938
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:26,400
hopeful that once the Articles out um

939
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,400
one of the directors or producers that

940
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,440
works with

941
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,760
will uh you know become interested in

942
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,520
telling the story really well oh cool

943
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,839
awesome I'll pass that on to my husband

944
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,119
he was a cinematographer for that he

945
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,040
primarily has been working in

946
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,720
documentary last few years Britain was

947
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,319
on the phone and I was like I was like

948
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,160
look guys like Britain I was like you

949
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,400
have the connections like you were the

950
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,880
cinematographer bad vegan like can't why

951
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,520
don't you just go like this talk to

952
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,480
people yeah and then and then like

953
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,480
that's when and that's when Ash went

954
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,760
because like theoretically without me

955
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,280
pushing this along why the didn't

956
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,680
Ash go

957
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,760
to months prior right like what took why

958
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,359
did she do that like I feel like I is

959
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:22,680
yeah okay that would make a lot of

960
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:27,160
money no question I'm in

961
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,040
shock as I stated in our in part one

962
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,319
this group appears to be using a

963
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,720
manipulated story of a deceased person

964
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:36,520
in order to drive out their

965
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,200
goals what we're uncovering again and

966
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,480
again is I mean again this is just kind

967
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,319
of scratching the surface it's it's that

968
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,920
there are so many more layers to this

969
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,480
this the deceased person it seems to me

970
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,040
in all of these 17 hours of calls that

971
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,880
I've had all these

972
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,720
recordings um with these people as part

973
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,520
of this group is that the story

974
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,839
is essentially a guise that really draws

975
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,280
people in and really makes people feel

976
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:08,319
like oh you know medical medium is so

977
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,839
bad and but then as I was really

978
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,839
speaking to these people and and hearing

979
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,040
them out about what was problematic

980
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:18,000
about you to them a huge percentage of

981
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,440
it was just all of this other stuff it

982
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,520
was there were all of these other layers

983
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,160
and all this stuff underneath the

984
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,839
surface these stories these rumors all

985
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,160
of this Twisted

986
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,480
misinformation and then you can kind of

987
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,040
see in the recordings in their own words

988
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,760
in a lot of these clips what is actually

989
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:37,119
going on behind the scenes and maybe

990
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,200
what's driving these people in in ways

991
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,760
that I don't know if they realize um but

992
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,200
maybe some people who are involved in

993
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,720
this are being driven by as I said

994
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,240
before some potentially misplaced grief

995
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,839
or potentially guilt about their own

996
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,040
involvement with the situation something

997
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,960
like that but it seems like a lot of it

998
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,240
is being driven by nefarious intentions

999
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,400
and by what some of these people can

1000
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,960
stand to gain personally professionally

1001
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:11,800
financially and otherwise from the

1002
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:15,079
Fulfillment of this plot this plan I'm

1003
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,920
seeing yeah I mean I'm in I don't even

1004
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:20,880
know what to say I like I can't get my

1005
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,640
words together because I'm hearing

1006
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,240
cinematographers um Making Connections

1007
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,880
Making Connections about the documentary

1008
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:32,680
that they're bringing to the media

1009
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:37,400
Outlet I'm hearing that I'm hearing

1010
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:40,920
money uh is is involved I'm

1011
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:43,119
hearing a person talk about how they

1012
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:47,480
wouldn't want to be on this train when

1013
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,760
this article comes out which is which is

1014
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,200
means they all knew they're all

1015
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,400
plotting it's their connections to the

1016
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,160
media company it's all in these

1017
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,880
recordings I heard it's it's a

1018
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,920
journalist dream because they're selling

1019
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
it to a journalist saying hey this is a

1020
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,079
journalist

1021
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
dream um I hear they're talking about

1022
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:11,000
how many numbers of book sold um things

1023
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:16,079
in that nature uh this is a

1024
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,880
premeditated plot who can do this it's

1025
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,680
unconscious doesn't matter how much

1026
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:25,079
damage is done to the community doesn't

1027
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,359
matter anything they have a strategy and

1028
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:31,480
a plan in place it's all there in the

1029
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,319
recordings I don't even know what to say

1030
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,880
when I hear these

1031
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:37,880
recordings can you replay that clip the

1032
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,240
important clip I mean they're all

1033
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,680
important but the important clip about

1034
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,720
they had the idea first the plot and

1035
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,280
they took it to the media company Brit

1036
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:51,800
was on the phone and I was like I was

1037
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,800
like look guys like Britain I was like

1038
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,200
you have the connections like you were

1039
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,640
the cinematographer bad vegan like why

1040
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:01,280
don't you just go like just talk to

1041
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,240
people yeah and then and then like

1042
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,240
that's when and that's when Ash went

1043
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,520
because like theoretically without me

1044
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,040
pushing this along why the didn't

1045
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,480
Ash go

1046
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,839
to months prior right like what took why

1047
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,280
did she do that like I feel like I inst

1048
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:22,079
it so it wasn't the media company that

1049
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,920
took upon the story upon themselves the

1050
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,480
recordings say everything it turns out

1051
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:31,720
it was their idea that's the instigator

1052
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,800
there and then the husband has the

1053
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:37,800
connections to the media

1054
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,760
outlet and they took that plot to the

1055
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,520
media

1056
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,880
Outlet um sounds like took the plot to

1057
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,359
the media Outlet using husband's

1058
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,200
connections

1059
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:53,400
too um and this is before it even

1060
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:57,800
started so this is even early on

1061
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,800
so what this plot is saying

1062
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:02,240
it's Unthinkable it's just

1063
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,040
Unthinkable yeah and like you were

1064
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,280
saying before it's these are we're

1065
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,400
showing motives we're showing true

1066
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,119
intentions by these people saying these

1067
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,480
things in their own words were showing

1068
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,240
all of this colluding and and just

1069
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:22,760
really interesting Dynamics and how this

1070
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:26,440
story all came to be and there's a

1071
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:30,040
serious lack of concern for the damage

1072
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,200
that essentially they intend to to cause

1073
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,800
so can you talk more about that and and

1074
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:40,839
how this process has has affected

1075
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:43,400
you well it's affected me for sure but

1076
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:47,280
the worst part is it's it's affected the

1077
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,960
communities because I had to Forfeit the

1078
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,880
book I was going to do for this year

1079
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,880
that was going to be released in October

1080
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,400
but there's no way to do it so it was a

1081
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,119
spiritual book that everybody was

1082
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:04,920
waiting for um so I had to cancel that

1083
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,200
um four months straight with hundreds of

1084
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,359
questions from a

1085
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,880
journalist

1086
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,720
and

1087
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,280
the I mean the crazy thing is it's just

1088
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,440
yeah I haven't worked in four months for

1089
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,720
the community at all so when you those

1090
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,160
are the things that I care about the

1091
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:28,400
most never mind the the damage you know

1092
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,960
involved with you know my family and um

1093
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,040
you know all of that involved it's it's

1094
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:37,720
really the big part for me is is the

1095
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,000
future of getting the information out to

1096
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,359
the community and all that so this is

1097
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,359
the first time since I started putting

1098
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,559
books out that I've had to

1099
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:49,960
Forfeit and actually just cancel the

1100
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:53,119
whole book um for for this year for sure

1101
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,359
so yeah there's it's it's affecting my

1102
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,160
life of course but it's affecting

1103
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,720
what which is what I always care about

1104
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,200
the most which is the community and

1105
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,359
people who are struggling that's always

1106
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:08,960
just number one for me you know anything

1107
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:12,880
in my life it's it's secondary anyway

1108
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:17,880
but still it's it yeah hasn't been

1109
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,319
easy yeah it's that's I mean for this to

1110
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,000
have

1111
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,920
affected the spiritual book that I know

1112
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,240
everybody in the community was so

1113
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,079
excited about and so much looking

1114
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:33,799
forward to it just there there really

1115
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:38,000
aren't any words um for how unfortunate

1116
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:39,839
how how disappointing how awful this is

1117
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,079
and again hearing the true intentions

1118
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,400
behind it all this this whole thing is

1119
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,040
just completely

1120
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,079
unprecedented it's something that's

1121
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,480
never happened before in the health and

1122
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,599
wellness industry there it's going to

1123
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,119
take some time for us to unpack this

1124
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:58,480
layer by layer and I'm great ful again

1125
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:01,319
that I have the pure evidence straight

1126
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,160
from these people's mouths to be able to

1127
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:05,559
really show people what's been going on

1128
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:08,720
because there are a lot of twists and

1129
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:10,960
turns to it and and I just want to also

1130
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
point out the fact that you Anthony have

1131
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,480
been talking about this all year you've

1132
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,760
been talking about this even I remember

1133
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,760
I think before that I you've been

1134
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,240
talking about this for a while that

1135
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,599
there are people who have been trying to

1136
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,920
take down the community that that's

1137
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,000
something that has become major issue

1138
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,680
and that people are not citing the

1139
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,359
original information back to Medical

1140
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:36,119
medium and um in the community and and

1141
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:38,799
this group you know has been persuading

1142
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,240
others to join them and to do the same

1143
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:43,559
and I know that a lot of people didn't

1144
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,799
really kind of believe what you'd been

1145
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,079
saying didn't want to believe it that

1146
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:51,359
there was really something like this

1147
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:53,520
going on and so it's extremely sad um

1148
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,960
unfortunately it's true and now

1149
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,920
everybody can hear it for themselves is

1150
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,319
any chance to play the last round of

1151
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,079
Clips again for for everybody and I

1152
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:05,000
personally want to hear them

1153
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,559
because

1154
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,720
um I I just still can't even believe it

1155
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,040
I mean when you think about this from a

1156
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,960
journalist perspective this pieace is

1157
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:17,119
unfuckin believable I mean this is this

1158
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,799
is a journalist dream I mean you want I

1159
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,880
mean the celebrities the number of books

1160
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:26,640
sold yeah it is awful and that's why

1161
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,960
this there's an article coming about him

1162
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,319
I don't know if you know anything about

1163
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,520
that it's not a good

1164
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,359
one I would not want to be on that train

1165
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:39,559
when that article comes out just saying

1166
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:41,760
I think there's there's a lot coming is

1167
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:44,000
what I think which is why it's really

1168
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,200
good that they're telling them now yeah

1169
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:51,240
we're hopeful that once the article's

1170
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:53,760
out um one of the directors or producers

1171
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,799
that Britain works with

1172
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,160
will uh you know become interested in

1173
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:01,880
telling the story really well oh cool

1174
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,240
awesome I'll pass that on to my husband

1175
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,520
he was a cinematographer for that he

1176
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,319
primarily has been working in

1177
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,680
documentary the last few

1178
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:15,119
years was on the phone and that was like

1179
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,240
I was like look guys like Britain I was

people yeah and then and then like

1184
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,839
that's when and that's when Ash went

1185
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:32,079
because like theoretically without me

1186
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,640
pushing this along why the didn't

1187
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,200
Ash go

1188
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:41,720

1189
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,079
she do that like I feel like I is it so

1190
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,240
he instigated it and instigated the

1191
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,760
number one plotter and a number one

1192
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,520
plot's husband to use connections to go

1193
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:54,400
to the mainstream media Outlet to get an

1194
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,760
article going about a deceased person

1195
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:02,000
who happens to be a a friend of the

1196
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:05,440
plotters friend of mine using her

1197
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,599
death and then having an article done by

1198
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,559
the media company so that bids when it

1199
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:12,079
comes out one of the plotters says I

1200
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,119
don't want to be on that train when that

1201
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,160
comes

1202
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,200
out all pushed by them and then when the

1203
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,280
article comes out bids for the

1204
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,040
documentary start and then the husband

1205
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,079
has connections to producers this is

1206
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,799
everything I heard on those

1207
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:34,880
recordings

1208
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:34,880
and this is allowed by mainstream

1209
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,880
media from what it looks like these are

1210
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:44,680
highly highly compromised sources that

1211
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,119
are Rivals business owners in the health

1212
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,720
space knocking out the medical medium

1213
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,400
medical medium

1214
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,160
Community would probably be very helpful

1215
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,799
for some of

1216
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,640
them

1217
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,599
from my opinion from what I'm seeing

1218
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,440
from

1219
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:03,319
these

1220
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,559
recordings of their exact

1221
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:11,240
words um do you have any

1222
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:13,880
so there's more than this you have hours

1223
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:18,040
and hours of

1224
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,000
this yes there are still hours and hours

1225
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:24,680
of a lot of content from these

1226
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,760
recordings to unpack um and and I intend

1227
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,520
that we'll we'll keep going with this

1228
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,400
and and continue peeling back these

1229
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,280
layers so

1230
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,200
so investigator journalist you're

1231
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,480
actually on the

1232
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,720
scene and you have uncovered a plot and

1233
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,000
uncovered a planned

1234
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,880
plan I've never seen anything like this

1235
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,319
in in alternative medicine or the health

1236
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,480
and wellness space ever in my life and

1237
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,880
I've been in the health and wells in

1238
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,839
this space for a very long time and I've

1239
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,079
never seen anything like

1240
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:59,599
this um yeah and it sounds like their

1241
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,720
plan is in the works and their plotted

1242
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,720
plan is is happening

1243
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,720
so

1244
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,119
um I think that uh your

1245
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,319
recordings

1246
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,480
are extremely extremely powerful and the

1247
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:20,160
community I'm sure appreciates you

1248
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:24,000
bringing this to light and um and

1249
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:28,160
exposing the plotters and exposing their

1250
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,480
plan and um I thank you and we have the

1251
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,680
community I'm sure they thank you too

1252
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,680
and

1253
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,920
truly honored that you're

1254
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,640
here it's the

1255
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:43,240
morning you get a

1256
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,799
call it's a roller coaster ride waiting

1257
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,960
for you to take a

1258
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:53,799
fall they send you on it they got some

1259
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,119
balls the fear and worry begins to rise

1260
00:55:53,799 --> 00:56:00,280
it feels it it will never

1261
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:03,200
subside you might die you're taken away

1262
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,680
from what's truly important service to

1263
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:09,880
the people first private life always on

1264
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:13,480
the back burner and hope someday you get

1265
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:16,119
to enjoy it but I doubt it everything

1266
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:19,799
gets put on hold as you battle the

1267
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:23,799
devils in the ones that want my name

1268
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:25,760
sold very bold as they try to run you

1269
00:56:23,799 --> 00:56:29,039
over with the truck

1270
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:33,079
they never show kindness they don't care

1271
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:36,039
no one yells duck you go down you hit

1272
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:39,240
the ground but you're not running you're

1273
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:42,480
sinking but you're not drowning and the

1274
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,319
tide begins to turn when the real truth

1275
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:49,039
Burns you never learned that the

1276
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:51,440

skit flips the clowns once beaming go
