[46.44 - 50.10] and the summer of healing so we're doing
[48.60 - 51.90] like the collecting Stones meditation
[50.10 - 52.68] Journey I'm reading about cleansing a
[51.90 - 55.26] little bit
[52.68 - 59.64] because summertime is an incredible time
[55.26 - 62.22] to do some cleansing and detoxing and
[59.64 - 64.92] healing so I'm reading out of cleansed
[62.22 - 66.66] heel right here so check this book out
[64.92 - 70.50] when you get a chance get it free at the
[66.66 - 72.80] library or go to amazon.com it is uh on
[70.50 - 75.48] sale there so that's incredible
[72.80 - 77.16] pathogens aren't always behind our
[75.48 - 80.16] cravings
[77.16 - 81.50] everybody's got pathogens everybody's
[80.16 - 84.66] got strep
[81.50 - 87.38] they have some type of pathogen within
[84.66 - 91.44] them they'll have Epstein-Barr shingles
[87.38 - 94.20] hhv6 cytomegalovirus they're hhv7 so
[91.44 - 96.84] many different cold sore viruses canker
[94.20 - 99.78] sore viruses so many people live with
[96.84 - 101.88] pathogens all the time and I remember
[99.78 - 104.70] the days before medical medium published
[101.88 - 107.58] books where no one in the health realm
[104.70 - 109.26] really knew about pathogens in the
[107.58 - 111.30] Natural Health realm at all nobody knew
[109.26 - 113.58] about pathogens being responsible for so
[111.30 - 115.38] many different symptoms conditions so
[113.58 - 117.30] this part I'm reading right now in
[115.38 - 118.62] cleanse the heel is about adrenaline
[117.30 - 121.86] release now we're talking about
[118.62 - 124.56] cleansing so hang in there for the ride
[121.86 - 126.96] I'm here Jacoby says I still need my
[124.56 - 127.98] Stones it's storming out there so you
[126.96 - 129.96] can't get it you'll get them later
[127.98 - 131.70] amazing
[129.96 - 134.24] pathogens aren't always behind our
[131.70 - 136.86] cravings when we avoid certain foods
[134.24 - 138.84] Cravings also have an emotional
[136.86 - 140.48] component now the reason why I was
[138.84 - 145.68] saying that is because
[140.48 - 149.22] pathogens love to eat certain foods and
[145.68 - 150.96] that can get us into the craving mode
[149.22 - 154.20] so when we have all these different
[150.96 - 158.22] pathogens inside of us they need to eat
[154.20 - 161.40] pathogens don't just exist and that's it
[158.22 - 164.76] they have to eat they have to reproduce
[161.40 - 166.68] that's what pathogens do
[164.76 - 168.00] Cravings also have an emotional
[166.68 - 169.80] component
[168.00 - 173.46] that's an important thing to understand
[169.80 - 176.10] too so if we have cravings could easily
[173.46 - 177.78] be an emotional component involved a
[176.10 - 179.52] trigger have you ever been triggered
[177.78 - 182.70] into cravings
[179.52 - 185.82] have you ever had a stress trigger of
[182.70 - 188.64] some kind that sends you into a place of
[185.82 - 191.16] craving I'm craving that coffee I'm
[188.64 - 194.88] craving that chocolate I'm craving that
[191.16 - 196.56] salty fatty sweet snack I'm craving that
[194.88 - 198.24] chocolate cake I'm craving those hot
[196.56 - 199.38] dogs craving those cheeseburgers craving
[198.24 - 202.50] those pizzas
[199.38 - 204.66] I'm craving chicken fingers I'm craving
[202.50 - 208.86] nuggets from the fast food chain
[204.66 - 210.48] restaurant I'm craving craving craving
[208.86 - 213.24] Cravings also have an emotional
[210.48 - 214.86] component people tend to be long oh this
[213.24 - 218.58] is really cool right here
[214.86 - 220.92] people tend to belong to one of two
[218.58 - 223.80] schools when it comes to eating and
[220.92 - 226.98] emotions see if this resonates at all
[223.80 - 229.02] with you guys in the one school are
[226.98 - 233.52] folks who eat to take their mind off
[229.02 - 236.52] their pain emotional pain do you eat to
[233.52 - 238.74] take your mind off of emotional pain
[236.52 - 240.24] where it's like get that food out like
[238.74 - 241.98] maybe you're at work or something like
[240.24 - 243.72] that you're maybe you're in the office
[241.98 - 245.04] maybe you're wherever you are maybe
[243.72 - 249.18] you're at a friend's house a family
[245.04 - 250.76] member's house and you're eating to
[249.18 - 253.86] suppress
[250.76 - 257.40] emotional pain you're eating to take
[253.86 - 260.06] your mind off of some type of emotional
[257.40 - 262.74] trigger emotional situation
[260.06 - 265.86] emotional pain
[262.74 - 268.62] when we're in this school and we take
[265.86 - 270.54] away certain Comfort Foods sometimes we
[268.62 - 273.74] start to experience a few feelings we
[270.54 - 276.48] were trying to use food to suppress
[273.74 - 277.92] interesting if you just got on here I'm
[276.48 - 280.02] actually reading out a cleanse Hill if
[277.92 - 281.34] you don't have this book
[280.02 - 283.20] if you don't have this book you're
[281.34 - 285.78] missing out it's incredible book
[283.20 - 289.86] Incredible medical textbook cleansing
[285.78 - 293.34] information has so many things in there
[289.86 - 295.32] so when you're in this one school so you
[293.34 - 296.94] there's people that belong to usually
[295.32 - 298.74] two schools when it comes to eating and
[296.94 - 300.18] emotions and this one school or folks
[298.74 - 301.74] who eat to take their mind off their
[300.18 - 304.14] pain and when we're in this school and
[301.74 - 306.06] we take away certain Comfort Foods we
[304.14 - 309.42] start to experience a few feelings we
[306.06 - 311.70] are trying to stuff down down inside
[309.42 - 313.26] stuff down I see a lot of people asking
[311.70 - 316.62] about the collecting Stones Journey
[313.26 - 319.50] maybe they don't Maybe
[316.62 - 320.82] many people didn't sign up and they need
[319.50 - 323.28] to sign up
[320.82 - 325.14] so keep that in mind you're getting a
[323.28 - 326.64] video today which is going to be
[325.14 - 328.68] incredible today's day one of the

[339.72 - 344.04] to be
[341.70 - 346.08] so that is a separate video then this
[344.04 - 348.24] live you must be signed up to receive so
[346.08 - 351.18] here's the thing this live is different
[348.24 - 352.98] than what that is a seven day
[351.18 - 354.72] collecting Stones meditations during you
[352.98 - 356.64] have to be signed up
[354.72 - 359.52] signed up I have three stones right here
[356.64 - 362.52] but you have to be signed up for that I
[359.52 - 364.50] hope you are truly
[362.52 - 367.62] sometimes we start to experience a few
[364.50 - 369.42] feelings when we take away Comfort Foods
[367.62 - 372.96] because we were using those Comfort
[369.42 - 374.52] foods to suppress and bury deep down
[372.96 - 378.90] inside
[374.52 - 381.90] Who stuff it down we're in pain we're
[378.90 - 385.26] struggling mentally and emotionally and
[381.90 - 387.36] we need to shove those emotions in
[385.26 - 389.94] constantly so we need those Comfort
[387.36 - 392.82] foods to shove them in deep that's how
[389.94 - 395.36] it's done Comfort Foods shove them in
[392.82 - 395.36] deep
[395.40 - 400.80] that old familiar sadness loneliness
[398.04 - 406.02] fear shame guilt
[400.80 - 409.08] anybody yeah it just hits everybody
[406.02 - 412.08] the sadness the loneliness the fear the
[409.08 - 414.72] shame the guilt or anger
[412.08 - 418.26] starts to cast a shadow over our
[414.72 - 420.54] thoughts we remove that food
[418.26 - 423.24] that was shoving it deep down inside
[420.54 - 426.84] that emotional pain
[423.24 - 430.56] we've removed that food and then anger
[426.84 - 434.52] can Surface anger can get triggered
[430.56 - 436.02] anger can steep up and start to take
[434.52 - 437.64] over
[436.02 - 439.56] that has that ever happened to any of
[437.64 - 441.54] you guys because you take away those
[439.56 - 443.04] Comfort Foods especially if you're
[441.54 - 445.02] taking away this Comfort foods and you
[443.04 - 448.46] don't have something really healing
[445.02 - 450.84] really nutritious really
[448.46 - 452.82] fortifiable for the brain if you don't
[450.84 - 454.92] have that then we get in trouble
[452.82 - 456.30] especially we get in trouble then
[454.92 - 458.46] hmm
[456.30 - 461.54] hopefully you don't mind
[458.46 - 461.54] a little sip here
[463.02 - 470.40] so even anger can start to Shadow over
[466.80 - 473.58] our thoughts or even creeps in as a
[470.40 - 475.50] sinking in the stomach or tightness in
[473.58 - 477.54] the chest and in that moment the
[475.50 - 481.20] pleasures of pizza or mac and cheese or
[477.54 - 484.14] ice cream seem the perfect antidote it's
[481.20 - 486.66] like when something starts creeping up
[484.14 - 489.96] something is percolating up something
[486.66 - 494.10] emotional is coming out of that Lion's
[489.96 - 496.26] Den out of that Dragon's Cave and when
[494.10 - 498.66] it starts to come up
[496.26 - 500.40] we gotta shove it back in we better get
[498.66 - 502.98] the macaroni and cheese out we better
[500.40 - 504.90] get the pizza out and ready we better
[502.98 - 507.84] get the chocolate cake going we better
[504.90 - 510.06] get the chocolate going the cacao we
[507.84 - 512.28] better get our favorite protein bars
[510.06 - 514.20] chocolate bars candy bars that are all
[512.28 - 516.42] natural filled with a whole bunch of
[514.20 - 519.48] crap and garbage we just better get
[516.42 - 522.54] whatever it is we better get stuff in us
[519.48 - 526.02] that comfort food and shove it down deep
[522.54 - 527.94] because that dragon's coming out of the
[526.02 - 529.86] cave and it's surfacing and it's coming
[527.94 - 531.18] out of there guys I'm reading how to
[529.86 - 532.50] cleanse the heel
[531.18 - 534.60] talking about cleansing because
[532.50 - 536.94] cleansing and detoxing is critical in
[534.60 - 538.68] the summer it's summer time perfect time
[536.94 - 539.64] to do it you're not freezing your ass
[538.68 - 541.92] off
[539.64 - 543.90] and it's summertime unless you're on the
[541.92 - 545.52] other opposite side of the planet and
[543.90 - 548.42] you're cold but still it's a good time
[545.52 - 548.42] to do it then too
[548.52 - 551.60] it's a really good time
[552.12 - 562.20] I say trying to suppress because
[557.12 - 565.26] does eating really suppress emotions
[562.20 - 568.14] does eating all those Comfort Foods
[565.26 - 571.98] really suppress the emotions
[568.14 - 576.18] or is it like a temporarily we shove it
[571.98 - 579.06] down but does it truly suppress it all
[576.18 - 581.04] because it comes back again and then we
[579.06 - 583.86] need the Comfort foods to shove it back
[581.04 - 585.66] down and then it comes back up again and
[583.86 - 587.22] we need the Comfort foods to shove it
[585.66 - 588.96] back down and what if you're somebody
[587.22 - 591.00] where you're doing the Comfort foods and
[588.96 - 592.98] it's not really working and the emotions
[591.00 - 595.80] are just kicking in the gear and you
[592.98 - 598.38] can't shove it down anymore and it seems
[595.80 - 601.26] to be coming up right the wild blueberry
[598.38 - 603.36] babe says no quick fix exactly so it
[601.26 - 606.72] just keeps on percolating keeps on
[603.36 - 609.14] coming out and we try to push it back
[606.72 - 609.14] down
[609.42 - 615.06] so I say trying to suppress
[612.54 - 617.58] because does eating really suppress
[615.06 - 619.68] emotions only temporarily are you
[617.58 - 622.34] reading that did you see that
[619.68 - 625.02] page 446 and cleanse the heel only
[622.34 - 626.88] temporarily it says right there there
[625.02 - 629.52] you go emotional liver
[626.88 - 632.36] live a rescue I think I got live rescue
[629.52 - 632.36] behind me right here
[634.68 - 640.74] and is suppression the real goal do we
[638.40 - 642.42] want to suppress it do we want to shove
[640.74 - 644.04] down those emotions do we want to try to
[642.42 - 646.98] keep it all down do you want to keep
[644.04 - 648.90] that pipe from exploding
[646.98 - 651.66] do we want
[648.90 - 654.44] to keep that hurt down
[651.66 - 654.44] deep
[655.62 - 662.94] in is suppression the real goal probably
[658.50 - 665.34] not healing is the real goal true
[662.94 - 667.80] emotional suppression can happen
[665.34 - 669.78] sometimes when you've been harmed and
[667.80 - 671.64] the adrenaline that Harbors the pain of
[669.78 - 673.44] the trauma gets stored deep in the
[671.64 - 676.16] neurons of the emotional centers of the
[673.44 - 678.84] brain that's usually not a bad thing
[676.16 - 680.22] emotional walls exist to protect us I
[678.84 - 682.98] want to talk about that for a little bit
[680.22 - 684.96] here I am cleanser heal you guys I saw
[682.98 - 688.76] somebody ask what book is it what page
[684.96 - 688.76] 446 and cleanse the heel
[689.64 - 695.64] so as we stuff things down
[692.70 - 700.20] to try to suppress the pain
[695.64 - 702.90] and push down that emotional hurt
[700.20 - 705.72] and we eat our comfort foods to try to
[702.90 - 708.78] keep it shoved down
[705.72 - 710.34] it still creeps back up
[708.78 - 713.28] because suppressing it with Comfort
[710.34 - 716.22] Foods isn't the answer
[713.28 - 718.08] but it's a really hard hard time Rooney
[716.22 - 720.12] says where do I sign up I think you sign
[718.08 - 721.56] up and Link is in the description if I'm
[720.12 - 723.36] not mistaken

[744.12 - 750.36] emotional walls exist to protect us
[747.24 - 753.36] other than this truly suppressed trauma
[750.36 - 755.10] though pain tends to resurface when we
[753.36 - 758.46] start thinking about it again we feel
[755.10 - 761.16] that urge to eat certain foods again
[758.46 - 763.08] I'm keeping myself distracted
[761.16 - 765.60] I'm eating
[763.08 - 768.24] a nice big bowl
[765.60 - 770.88] of macaroni and cheese
[768.24 - 772.50] the cheese has got kind of burnt on top
[770.88 - 774.42] a little bit so it's nice and brown and
[772.50 - 776.88] crispy on top
[774.42 - 778.92] just the way I like it
[776.88 - 783.30] took it out of the oven
[778.92 - 786.54] it's this tasty cheesy macaroni kind of
[783.30 - 787.44] a burnt topping crack into it with a
[786.54 - 790.26] fork
[787.44 - 792.60] I'm keeping myself distracted this is
[790.26 - 794.58] helping me emotionally in the moment
[792.60 - 799.32] it's helping me
[794.58 - 801.00] keep down that Dragon I've been hurt
[799.32 - 803.22] I've been hurt bad
[801.00 - 805.62] I had a bad day
[803.22 - 807.72] I'm tired
[805.62 - 810.72] crack open
[807.72 - 814.70] that cheesy surface with the fork get
[810.72 - 814.70] that mac and cheese in my system
[820.02 - 825.66] then the pain starts resurface again
[823.38 - 828.18] we start thinking about that pain and
[825.66 - 831.24] that suffering again I'm not
[828.18 - 834.32] being distracted enough again I need a
[831.24 - 834.32] slice of pizza now
[835.44 - 838.74] when we start thinking about food again

[861.00 - 865.44] announcement
[863.40 - 869.04] but I didn't get an email or something
[865.44 - 872.18] for login or a link
[869.04 - 872.18] over there on IG
[872.64 - 876.90] we will be posting I got an answer for
[874.86 - 879.18] that we will be posting a link to the
[876.90 - 881.70] help desk on all social media platforms
[879.18 - 883.62] if anyone is having trouble that's
[881.70 - 885.84] signed up to the collecting Stones
[883.62 - 888.74] meditation journey and you're you're
[885.84 - 888.74] lost in the moment
[890.58 - 896.10] when we start feeling or thinking about
[892.62 - 899.04] that hurt again that trigger again
[896.10 - 900.96] we want to eat certain foods again and
[899.04 - 904.02] that can keep happening over and over
[900.96 - 906.12] again if we don't know which foods can
[904.02 - 907.68] actually help our bodies heal while
[906.12 - 909.48] we're going through emotional hardships
[907.68 - 910.80] and I get it we can eat ourselves sick
[909.48 - 912.90] when we're going through some hardships
[910.80 - 914.64] now remember this is the school of
[912.90 - 917.76] eating when you have a trigger this is
[914.64 - 920.52] the school of eating Comfort Foods when
[917.76 - 923.52] you have a hardship I'm not in the other
[920.52 - 925.26] school yet so we'll get there too
[923.52 - 927.42] and I realized that when we're in this
[925.26 - 929.88] school of eating a lot of foods to
[927.42 - 933.68] shove down emotional pain emotional
[929.88 - 936.72] sorrow when we're using food as a drug
[933.68 - 938.70] we're using food as a drug to shove it
[936.72 - 941.16] down deep inside when we're in that
[938.70 - 943.02] position we can eat ourselves sick where
[941.16 - 945.54] the food we can't even get enough food
[943.02 - 947.70] in us anymore to kind of numb things up
[945.54 - 949.38] or help it out because their stomachs
[947.70 - 952.08] can't handle any more food how many
[949.38 - 954.56] people go through that delete a whole
[952.08 - 957.12] cheese pizza or pepperoni cheese pizza
[954.56 - 959.10] and they're stuffed they can't even
[957.12 - 960.66] breathe but then their mind is on how
[959.10 - 962.40] stuffed they are but if that trigger
[960.66 - 964.26] starts happening again they're kind of
[962.40 - 966.66] stuck because they can't go and eat a
[964.26 - 968.28] whole nother cheese pizza to shove it
[966.66 - 970.44] down and shove those emotions down
[968.28 - 972.72] because their stomach is so full so
[970.44 - 975.44] they're in this weird lull it's torture
[972.72 - 975.44] for a lot of people
[976.02 - 981.30] one of the reasons we consume Comfort
[978.66 - 983.70] Foods in the first place is to sop up
[981.30 - 985.44] the adrenaline that comes with emotional
[983.70 - 987.54] disturbances and conflicts and I just
[985.44 - 989.28] want to say that we don't know that
[987.54 - 991.74] we don't know that I mean that's medical
[989.28 - 994.26] meme info but people don't know that's
[991.74 - 996.36] what's happening
[994.26 - 998.10] where we don't know we're consuming
[996.36 - 1000.74] Comfort Foods in the first place to stop
[998.10 - 1002.66] up adrenaline nobody ever knew that I
[1000.74 - 1004.64] mean that's medical meme info it's in
[1002.66 - 1006.20] the books but nobody knew that that
[1004.64 - 1008.18] that's what we're doing
[1006.20 - 1010.46] but that's what we're doing that's one
[1008.18 - 1012.20] of these innate Instincts by the way
[1010.46 - 1014.78] because when you go through a hardship
[1012.20 - 1017.48] in a difficult time you get an
[1014.78 - 1020.24] adrenaline explosion
[1017.48 - 1023.12] or implosion
[1020.24 - 1024.44] which you get an adrenaline
[1023.12 - 1026.54] surge
[1024.44 - 1027.98] and when that surge happens it's
[1026.54 - 1029.48] floating around through your bloodstream
[1027.98 - 1031.16] it's throat floating around in your
[1029.48 - 1032.78] organs it's hitting your brain and it's
[1031.16 - 1034.04] got all kinds of information in there
[1032.78 - 1036.44] that I was talking about that
[1034.04 - 1038.84] information if I was hurt that trust was
[1036.44 - 1041.00] broken I was let down I was betrayed
[1038.84 - 1044.42] something happened to me something's
[1041.00 - 1046.64] wrong I'm upset again I was triggered
[1044.42 - 1049.10] that was a terrible argument I just got
[1046.64 - 1051.68] into with with someone that's my partner
[1049.10 - 1054.14] my friend I'm in a relationship whatever
[1051.68 - 1057.44] it is that's happening
[1054.14 - 1058.94] that adrenaline is coursing through your
[1057.44 - 1062.84] system and coursing through your system
[1058.94 - 1064.82] and then we actually take food and don't
[1062.84 - 1067.22] realize it we don't realize that this is
[1064.82 - 1070.88] part of an innate innate instinct is we
[1067.22 - 1072.50] take food and we eat it because we're
[1070.88 - 1074.72] actually trying not just because we're
[1072.50 - 1077.54] hungry we're eating it because we're
[1074.72 - 1079.76] trying to sop up the adrenaline surge
[1077.54 - 1082.72] toxic adrenaline that has so much
[1079.76 - 1082.72] information in it
[1083.54 - 1090.38] traditional Comfort Foods think tacos
[1086.66 - 1093.44] nachos Pizza mac and cheese ice cream
[1090.38 - 1097.06] spaghetti with meatballs pancakes french
[1093.44 - 1097.06] fries Lobster with butter
[1097.46 - 1103.16] chicken wings pulled pork sandwiches
[1101.24 - 1104.12] now I've never had a pulled pork
[1103.16 - 1106.64] sandwich
[1104.12 - 1108.92] ever in my life
[1106.64 - 1111.02] and anytime I like hear somebody had one
[1108.92 - 1113.36] or someone ate one or there's there's
[1111.02 - 1115.28] one on some kind of thing on social
[1113.36 - 1119.18] media or something and some chefs making
[1115.28 - 1121.88] a pulled pork sandwich and I mean I
[1119.18 - 1123.56] can't eat that I just can't do it you
[1121.88 - 1125.90] know there's something about it I can't
[1123.56 - 1128.18] eat a pulled pork sandwich I just can't
[1125.90 - 1130.22] but I'm but I'm not shaming anybody that
[1128.18 - 1131.96] can or anybody that does and I'm not
[1130.22 - 1134.48] making fun of anybody that does and I'm
[1131.96 - 1136.94] not judging anybody that does but every
[1134.48 - 1139.16] time I always think pancreatitis you
[1136.94 - 1141.50] know every time I see somebody playing
[1139.16 - 1143.24] with pork or eating a pulled pork
[1141.50 - 1145.10] sandwich or something like that all I
[1143.24 - 1147.62] think of is pancreatitis it's like
[1145.10 - 1150.80] pulled pork pancreatitis pulled pork
[1147.62 - 1153.44] sandwiches pancreatitis
[1150.80 - 1156.40] grilled cheese fried eggs are usually
[1153.44 - 1157.94] high in fat that fat is what's
[1156.40 - 1161.18] soaking
[1157.94 - 1164.18] stuff up the fat is what's doing the
[1161.18 - 1166.10] sopping up so here's what's happening
[1164.18 - 1168.44] you get some bad news you got triggered
[1166.10 - 1170.72] or you're just in a mode and you got
[1168.44 - 1172.58] triggered somehow some way you got PTSD
[1170.72 - 1175.40] and you got triggered
[1172.58 - 1177.02] someone could easily have some PTSD and
[1175.40 - 1180.86] they get triggered so now we're
[1177.02 - 1182.90] triggered so now our adrenal is surging
[1180.86 - 1185.06] it's coursing through our veins and our
[1182.90 - 1186.92] organs and as that adrenaline is
[1185.06 - 1189.08] coursing through our veins and organs
[1186.92 - 1191.80] it's got information in it that's hurt
[1189.08 - 1196.40] we're hurt fear
[1191.80 - 1199.04] guilt shame anger all coursing through
[1196.40 - 1201.92] our veins and then we go and we take
[1199.04 - 1203.96] something that's greasy or fried and we
[1201.92 - 1205.76] want to sop it up we don't know that's
[1203.96 - 1209.24] what we're doing but we're innately
[1205.76 - 1212.42] trying to stop up the adrenaline
[1209.24 - 1215.60] and that's part of the whole suppressing
[1212.42 - 1218.06] emotions that's going on that's part of
[1215.60 - 1220.70] the whole eating to suppress eating to
[1218.06 - 1222.86] shove it down deep inside that's all
[1220.70 - 1224.72] part of it right there
[1222.86 - 1226.34] so when we're doing traditional Comfort
[1224.72 - 1227.96] Foods now you might be a vegan and
[1226.34 - 1229.94] you're shoving it down with all kinds of
[1227.96 - 1231.86] you know crazy nut butter concoctions
[1229.94 - 1233.84] and donuts and cakes that are vegan
[1231.86 - 1236.12] donuts and cakes filled with canola oil
[1233.84 - 1237.44] and all this garbage right you might be
[1236.12 - 1239.36] somebody that's shoving it you might be
[1237.44 - 1241.88] a vegan or a plant-based person and
[1239.36 - 1245.06] you're shoving it down with uh a vegan
[1241.88 - 1246.56] bar or shoving it down with a chocolate
[1245.06 - 1248.90] bar
[1246.56 - 1250.46] all that cacao all that fat to sop up
[1248.90 - 1251.90] that adrenaline because you're triggered
[1250.46 - 1254.06] so you're trying to sop up all that
[1251.90 - 1256.34] adrenaline so maybe you're somebody
[1254.06 - 1257.78] that's like well I do healthier stuff I
[1256.34 - 1259.88] like to have my cooking and ice cream
[1257.78 - 1261.98] when I'm in a bad mood or I'm triggered
[1259.88 - 1264.50] or got some PTSD let me go get some
[1261.98 - 1266.48] coconut ice cream you know I don't do
[1264.50 - 1269.48] lactose
[1266.48 - 1271.94] but still we use it and we're shoving it
[1269.48 - 1274.10] down and we're trying to sop up all that
[1271.94 - 1276.20] adrenaline quick little Interruption
[1274.10 - 1278.54] here the collecting Stones meditation
[1276.20 - 1280.82] Journey emails are coming
[1278.54 - 1283.34] from Hay House

[1283.34 - 1287.24] getting confused looking for medical
[1284.66 - 1289.22] medium and not Hay House emails I just
[1287.24 - 1291.26] wanted to give you that quick update for
[1289.22 - 1293.30] anybody
[1291.26 - 1295.58] so when we're trying to shove stuff down
[1293.30 - 1297.62] and it's not the more vegan or
[1295.58 - 1299.24] plant-based options or something like
[1297.62 - 1301.22] that that still may not be good for us
[1299.24 - 1302.78] we shove it down with tacos and nachos
[1301.22 - 1304.28] and pizza mac and cheese ice cream
[1302.78 - 1306.32] spaghetti meatballs pancakes french
[1304.28 - 1307.82] fries Lobster and butter I don't know I
[1306.32 - 1311.06] guess some people will do Lobster and
[1307.82 - 1313.04] butter right chicken wings chicken wings
[1311.06 - 1314.60] people definitely
[1313.04 - 1316.46] fried chicken wings
[1314.60 - 1318.38] they definitely shove those emotion down
[1316.46 - 1321.56] down with chicken wings no question
[1318.38 - 1324.56] right buffalo chicken wings pulled pork
[1321.56 - 1326.96] sandwiches pancreatitis
[1324.56 - 1328.88] grilled cheese fried eggs they're
[1326.96 - 1333.26] usually high in fat that fat is what's
[1328.88 - 1336.38] doing the sopping up the fat coursing
[1333.26 - 1339.44] through your veins and bloodstream
[1336.38 - 1341.00] are sopping up
[1339.44 - 1342.86] boom
[1341.00 - 1344.96] Vicky Woody says thank you about hay
[1342.86 - 1347.18] house I was going crazy to check Hay
[1344.96 - 1348.14] House emails because Hay House emails
[1347.18 - 1350.66] right now
[1348.14 - 1352.64] are you know because they're hosting the
[1350.66 - 1355.28] event with me right
[1352.64 - 1357.62] Marlo 333 is there supposed to be live
[1355.28 - 1360.32] meditation with the email I only saw
[1357.62 - 1362.12] video nope it's a video a day
[1360.32 - 1365.12] video a day
[1362.12 - 1366.26] but I am here live right now talking
[1365.12 - 1367.76] about it we're talking about other
[1366.26 - 1370.04] things too
[1367.76 - 1372.14] someone said hummus
[1370.04 - 1374.30] yeah hummus with all that tahini in
[1372.14 - 1376.58] there and olive oil in it to sop it up
[1374.30 - 1379.22] so maybe you're a plant-based person and
[1376.58 - 1382.12] you're sopping it up
[1379.22 - 1382.12] those emotions
[1382.40 - 1387.32] loving healing says once I accept it
[1384.56 - 1390.08] that detox was going to be emotional it
[1387.32 - 1393.50] helped ride the waves and finally push
[1390.08 - 1396.62] forward with healing foods
[1393.50 - 1399.62] amen that was really a really
[1396.62 - 1402.44] interesting and spot on
[1399.62 - 1406.04] Ro says
[1402.44 - 1407.66] was hospitalized to pancreatitis twice
[1406.04 - 1409.88] I'm so sorry to hear that and I believe
[1407.66 - 1412.16] you were of course because a lot of
[1409.88 - 1415.24] people that happens to them and I'm so
[1412.16 - 1415.24] sorry you've gone through that
[1417.86 - 1424.22] here's the key point
[1421.04 - 1426.62] the fat cells trap the adrenaline the
[1424.22 - 1428.48] adrenaline has emotions in it from what
[1426.62 - 1430.64] you're going through your PTSD and
[1428.48 - 1433.40] everything else
[1430.64 - 1435.74] and with that
[1433.40 - 1437.84] your adrenaline then gets trapped in the
[1435.74 - 1441.02] fat cells and all the different fat that
[1437.84 - 1442.64] gets stored up into organs
[1441.02 - 1446.36] in the case of adrenaline that was
[1442.64 - 1448.82] released at a highly emotional time
[1446.36 - 1451.34] it holds information about the fear hurt
[1448.82 - 1452.66] betrayal injury or stress overload we
[1451.34 - 1454.16] were experiencing in that moment what
[1452.66 - 1456.50] I'm trying to say is I'll just break it
[1454.16 - 1458.36] down right here
[1456.50 - 1461.14] I'll break it down right here
[1458.36 - 1461.14] we get hurt
[1461.78 - 1469.22] we have an emotional adrenaline surge
[1465.92 - 1472.28] we might be experiencing some type or
[1469.22 - 1474.20] form of chaos emotional chaos of some in
[1472.28 - 1477.74] some way fear
[1474.20 - 1479.42] anger all of it
[1477.74 - 1480.86] adrenaline's floating around in our
[1479.42 - 1482.78] bloodstream
[1480.86 - 1486.02] coursing through our veins
[1482.78 - 1488.36] we have this innate response
[1486.02 - 1491.66] of shooting for a comfort food grabbing
[1488.36 - 1493.76] a comfort food that's high in fat most
[1491.66 - 1495.68] definitely and high in sugar a lot of
[1493.76 - 1497.96] times it's not the sugar
[1495.68 - 1498.86] but it's the high fat content that
[1497.96 - 1500.96] really
[1498.86 - 1503.54] stops up the adrenaline we eat that high
[1500.96 - 1505.34] fatty food it soaks up the adrenaline
[1503.54 - 1507.20] and then stores it deep in her organs
[1505.34 - 1508.40] with the information of that hurt when
[1507.20 - 1511.54] we cleanse
[1508.40 - 1511.54] it comes out
[1511.58 - 1515.42] some people don't eat when trauma
[1513.92 - 1517.10] happens and I'm about to get to that
[1515.42 - 1520.82] that's the second School we're about to
[1517.10 - 1523.28] read and they eat and they grab Comfort
[1520.82 - 1524.78] Foods at some point when it's later on
[1523.28 - 1526.76] down the road because they have to eat
[1524.78 - 1528.68] at some point so they have hurt they
[1526.76 - 1530.54] have pain they have fear they're
[1528.68 - 1532.10] triggered they got the PTSD and they
[1530.54 - 1534.74] don't eat they've got the spigot off
[1532.10 - 1536.78] they shut the spigot off and that's off
[1534.74 - 1539.44] and then they don't eat but they gotta
[1536.78 - 1539.44] eat eventually
[1540.14 - 1547.04] let's see joking
[1544.06 - 1549.56] says I am discouraged I receive so much
[1547.04 - 1551.60] acne after the cleanse I know I should
[1549.56 - 1555.38] continue but I am not happy because
[1551.60 - 1557.18] first I had it hadn't it and now I have
[1555.38 - 1560.18] it a lot so I'll give you a couple
[1557.18 - 1561.44] little rundowns on that first of all
[1560.18 - 1563.54] um
[1561.44 - 1565.34] what cleanse are you even doing what's
[1563.54 - 1567.74] going on in there many things could be
[1565.34 - 1570.50] happening could have had exposure at
[1567.74 - 1572.36] some point when people say they did the
[1570.50 - 1573.80] cleanse I've had situations where it's
[1572.36 - 1576.56] not even a medical meme cleanse that
[1573.80 - 1578.54] we're doing a lot of people just are
[1576.56 - 1580.52] just doing somebody's cleanse is that
[1578.54 - 1581.66] something to know were you doing a
[1580.52 - 1583.34] cleanse plus a whole bunch of different
[1581.66 - 1584.48] other stuff were you doing a cleanse and
[1583.34 - 1586.90] a whole bunch of different supplements
[1584.48 - 1590.00] that were filled with all this garbage
[1586.90 - 1591.86] which cleanse were you even doing was it
[1590.00 - 1594.26] out of a medical medium book were you
[1591.86 - 1595.76] eating something before the cleanse that
[1594.26 - 1597.26] was crazy were you eating something
[1595.76 - 1599.36] right after the cleanse that was crazy
[1597.26 - 1601.64] it there's so many different aspects it
[1599.36 - 1604.64] can go you can go on and on and on did
[1601.64 - 1608.48] you get a recent bacterial exposure to
[1604.64 - 1610.22] kick up the acne did the acne get
[1608.48 - 1612.50] triggered by something else from some
[1610.22 - 1615.62] other exposure that you were
[1612.50 - 1617.48] susceptible to or mean or exposed to it
[1615.62 - 1619.10] the list goes on so we have to be a
[1617.48 - 1620.60] detective we have to understand the
[1619.10 - 1622.94] books and the information and be a
[1620.60 - 1625.46] detective understand what we're doing
[1622.94 - 1628.88] some people before they go on a cleanse
[1625.46 - 1631.16] they trash themselves with a ton of
[1628.88 - 1632.66] crazy food and I can't be a fly on the
[1631.16 - 1634.40] wall in everybody's house and
[1632.66 - 1636.74] everybody's bathroom
[1634.40 - 1639.16] but I do know this that a lot of people
[1636.74 - 1642.26] before they embark on a cleanse
[1639.16 - 1644.84] eat the out of a bunch of comfort
[1642.26 - 1647.90] food that comfort food gets in their
[1644.84 - 1650.66] liver it gets in their bloodstream in
[1647.90 - 1652.94] their lymphatic system it feeds all
[1650.66 - 1654.86] kinds of bacteria all kinds of other
[1652.94 - 1657.02] pathogen matter then you go on the
[1654.86 - 1659.78] cleanse but yet all that stuff is
[1657.02 - 1661.22] sitting there feeding bugs so you might
[1659.78 - 1662.42] have to do you know ask your doctor
[1661.22 - 1664.16] what's right for you but you might have
[1662.42 - 1667.76] to do another cleanse you might have to
[1664.16 - 1669.62] do another one with it and then did you
[1667.76 - 1671.90] look at protocols as you look at
[1669.62 - 1674.18] protocols with acne did you look at the
[1671.90 - 1676.16] supplementation protocols and read about
[1674.18 - 1678.68] that because when you're dealing with
[1676.16 - 1681.02] acne or dealing with pathogens did you
[1678.68 - 1682.58] have any recent antibiotic use out there
[1681.02 - 1685.70] I'm saying this to everybody overall
[1682.58 - 1687.04] blankets for everybody blanket statement
[1685.70 - 1689.54] for everybody did you use any
[1687.04 - 1693.14] antibiotics for something recently
[1689.54 - 1694.88] because strep is antibiotic resistant it
[1693.14 - 1696.80] goes down from antibiotics and then it
[1694.88 - 1698.84] goes back up stronger than ever and
[1696.80 - 1701.96] that's how it works
[1698.84 - 1704.72] um or was your body killing off so much
[1701.96 - 1706.94] stress so much strep was your body
[1704.72 - 1709.16] killing and eliminating so much strep
[1706.94 - 1711.44] while you were cleansing and then you
[1709.16 - 1714.08] had just all the toxic crap coming out
[1711.44 - 1715.52] the strap was fighting for its life so
[1714.08 - 1717.62] it came out because you're actually
[1715.52 - 1720.08] making a dent in it and cleaning it up
[1717.62 - 1722.30] I'm trying to give people all the tips
[1720.08 - 1725.60] right up front a whole bunch of them to
[1722.30 - 1727.58] take a look at and see what's going on
[1725.60 - 1729.74] yeah I mean it's so simple as that
[1727.58 - 1731.30] including you know new relationships
[1729.74 - 1732.50] from six months ago before you started
[1731.30 - 1734.60] your cleanse where you were already
[1732.50 - 1736.28] coming into a place where you were about
[1734.60 - 1738.92] to get a new strep infection causing
[1736.28 - 1741.02] acne and other symptoms maybe a new
[1738.92 - 1743.66] relationship whole bit it's the whole
[1741.02 - 1745.28] whole thing so all these things are
[1743.66 - 1747.08] including including drinking off
[1745.28 - 1749.48] somebody else's glasses eating off of
[1747.08 - 1753.20] somebody else's plates but in all of
[1749.48 - 1754.64] that okay or like were you careful with
[1753.20 - 1756.02] the grocery cart handles because I'm
[1754.64 - 1758.60] going to tell you right now there's at
[1756.02 - 1761.24] least at least 50 different varieties of
[1758.60 - 1764.86] strep these days these days right now on
[1761.24 - 1764.86] grocery store cart handles
[1765.08 - 1769.64] so I would use a white bee on that
[1767.30 - 1771.62] grocery store card handle just a minute
[1769.64 - 1773.30] you even get up to it I would never go
[1771.62 - 1775.34] up to it and just grab it and be like
[1773.30 - 1776.96] hey I'm a warrior doesn't even matter
[1775.34 - 1778.94] boom boom boom Going Through the store
[1776.96 - 1781.64] or whatever scratch your face hit your
[1778.94 - 1783.86] eye get your car keys out whatever do
[1781.64 - 1785.30] this and this and this and then boom you
[1783.86 - 1788.50] just got two more varieties of
[1785.30 - 1791.36] streptococcus streptococcal and strip
[1788.50 - 1793.34] might be someone who needs to get off of
[1791.36 - 1794.90] grains and chocolate as well they could
[1793.34 - 1797.42] be doing that while they're cleansing
[1794.90 - 1799.46] they could be cleansing and doing
[1797.42 - 1801.20] chocolate while they're cleansing I
[1799.46 - 1805.52] can't be the fly on the wall but I wish
[1801.20 - 1808.64] I had my flat on the wall friend aw here
[1805.52 - 1810.80] who usually does fly in the wall stuff
[1808.64 - 1812.72] for you guys which we will do Again
[1810.80 - 1814.22] David witch and says do fly on the wall
[1812.72 - 1815.72] soon again
[1814.22 - 1817.58] yeah
[1815.72 - 1820.52] indeed
[1817.58 - 1822.56] see Lila Collins I took my time cutting
[1820.52 - 1824.78] out fats five years later all I have is
[1822.56 - 1826.04] celery juice smoothies raw foods fruits
[1824.78 - 1828.44] and vegetables with beverages
[1826.04 - 1831.20] supplements you can do it too which
[1828.44 - 1832.94] means it's really helping you
[1831.20 - 1835.58] so
[1832.94 - 1837.02] all this stuff is important to know keep
[1835.58 - 1839.54] that in mind
[1837.02 - 1842.48] um just gave you a rundown on so many
[1839.54 - 1845.36] different aspects of what's going on
[1842.48 - 1847.28] of how it works you literally could be
[1845.36 - 1849.44] coming down with a new variety of strep
[1847.28 - 1850.64] you picked up three months ago and the
[1849.44 - 1852.92] cleansing is critical because it's
[1850.64 - 1856.46] helping to get it out you can also be in
[1852.92 - 1858.32] a place where you fed it prior you can
[1856.46 - 1860.66] also be in a place where you're actually
[1858.32 - 1862.94] cleansing out old antibiotics in your
[1860.66 - 1865.82] system for from 15 years ago 10 years
[1862.94 - 1868.76] ago from when you took antibiotics for
[1865.82 - 1870.92] strep infections for strep throat and
[1868.76 - 1873.50] acne and that's coming out of your liver
[1870.92 - 1876.08] so that can be a whole other aspect of
[1873.50 - 1878.42] it but either way it for everybody
[1876.08 - 1880.88] people got different situations stubborn
[1878.42 - 1883.28] strep bacteria are like super bugs and
[1880.88 - 1885.92] they can take a lot of strong protocols
[1883.28 - 1887.42] for a while to get rid of them it takes
[1885.92 - 1889.22] time for a lot of people here's another
[1887.42 - 1891.62] thing everybody's acne is different
[1889.22 - 1892.64] because everybody's acne isn't the same
[1891.62 - 1895.40] strip
[1892.64 - 1898.40] keep that in mind too that's a big one
[1895.40 - 1901.22] right there someone can have such a
[1898.40 - 1902.60] stubborn strep that takes time and
[1901.22 - 1905.84] protocols
[1902.60 - 1907.52] because it's so antibiotic resistant or
[1905.84 - 1908.90] so stubborn there's so many strains
[1907.52 - 1911.06] there's hundreds and hundreds of strains
[1908.90 - 1912.62] of strep and someone can have multiple
[1911.06 - 1914.48] strains of strep and this is critical to
[1912.62 - 1916.16] know right here since we're on this
[1914.48 - 1918.56] topic because I want to help out like
[1916.16 - 1920.48] this stuff too not just the emotional
[1918.56 - 1923.06] aspect but the physical aspect with
[1920.48 - 1925.34] things and I just want to say
[1923.06 - 1926.78] that you can be some you can have
[1925.34 - 1928.82] someone you can have two different
[1926.78 - 1930.50] people with two different forms of acne
[1928.82 - 1933.28] nobody even knows the difference so one
[1930.50 - 1938.12] person has one antibiotic stubborn
[1933.28 - 1941.96] really really mean mean ass strep and
[1938.12 - 1944.48] then another person it's not so stubborn
[1941.96 - 1947.36] it's not so antibiotic resistant or
[1944.48 - 1949.76] resistant to things and doesn't take too
[1947.36 - 1951.14] much to clean it up another person could
[1949.76 - 1954.44] have more strep in their lymphatic
[1951.14 - 1956.48] system and less in their lymphatic
[1954.44 - 1958.04] system the next person more strep in
[1956.48 - 1960.62] your liver and the other person with
[1958.04 - 1962.12] acne has less strep in their liver so
[1960.62 - 1963.86] that's a whole other thing too the
[1962.12 - 1965.60] different amounts and all that and you
[1963.86 - 1969.44] can pick up a strap from somebody else
[1965.60 - 1971.48] who took 20 antibiotics and that strep
[1969.44 - 1973.40] was stubborn as heck and then you got
[1971.48 - 1975.80] that same variety and that happens to
[1973.40 - 1977.66] people a lot a lot of people get into
[1975.80 - 1979.94] relationships and the person that got
[1977.66 - 1982.10] into a relationship with has a stubborn
[1979.94 - 1984.50] strep that they took antibiotics for 10
[1982.10 - 1987.86] years for one that was giving them UTIs
[1984.50 - 1990.14] and then they picked up that strep from
[1987.86 - 1992.60] that person and now they have that that
[1990.14 - 1994.70] strap in their system that's that's um
[1992.60 - 1997.10] immune to 20 antibiotics and it's
[1994.70 - 2000.52] stubborn so
[1997.10 - 2002.50] oh dear lord
[2000.52 - 2005.08] somebody could have a strep that's been
[2002.50 - 2006.94] in 20 other people who took a hundred
[2005.08 - 2008.62] antibiotics
[2006.94 - 2011.74] and that
[2008.62 - 2013.84] can happen too so I hate to say this but
[2011.74 - 2017.32] someone
[2013.84 - 2019.48] can be in a strap that was in
[2017.32 - 2022.48] 20 people
[2019.48 - 2024.34] and 100 antibiotics it's that crazy how
[2022.48 - 2026.38] it works so
[2024.34 - 2027.22] before we go down the rabbit hole with
[2026.38 - 2032.02] this
[2027.22 - 2034.30] what it is is these things we can move
[2032.02 - 2036.76] out of our body we can cleanse out and
[2034.30 - 2040.06] we can beat out because we can starve
[2036.76 - 2042.46] these bacteria and pathogens
[2040.06 - 2044.50] we can starve them if we take away the
[2042.46 - 2046.12] food that the pathogens like which is
[2044.50 - 2047.56] medical medium information because guess
[2046.12 - 2050.80] what nobody knew
[2047.56 - 2052.96] pathogens like bacteria actually ate
[2050.80 - 2055.30] anything and now you see how much people
[2052.96 - 2057.52] how many people in the industry poached
[2055.30 - 2060.52] medical medium information about that
[2057.52 - 2064.36] acne is bacterial it's not hormones you
[2060.52 - 2067.78] got acne you have bacteria causing it
[2064.36 - 2069.40] so all good information we just ran
[2067.78 - 2071.38] across a whole strap thing just now
[2069.40 - 2073.42] Nicole says I need help with chocolate
[2071.38 - 2075.76] I'm addicted
[2073.42 - 2077.26] I understand completely it's it's not an
[2075.76 - 2079.06] easy one chocolate is one of those
[2077.26 - 2081.28] things where the caffeine has everybody
[2079.06 - 2084.46] so jacked up once you come off that
[2081.28 - 2087.04] caffeine ride it's intense really
[2084.46 - 2090.36] intense and by the way there's an acne
[2087.04 - 2090.36] protocol in cleanse the heel
[2093.64 - 2096.48] good good good
[2097.84 - 2103.72] Sarah
[2099.16 - 2106.00] my fiance my fiance has cellulitis
[2103.72 - 2110.20] two rounds of antibiotics and no relief
[2106.00 - 2112.78] I started him on celery juice boom gone
[2110.20 - 2115.48] Sarah incredible and that proves
[2112.78 - 2116.74] something very important right there I
[2115.48 - 2118.66] always say
[2116.74 - 2120.58] everybody's different
[2118.66 - 2124.06] their exposures what they have in them
[2120.58 - 2127.06] and everything else so your fiance only
[2124.06 - 2131.08] needed celery juice
[2127.06 - 2133.72] to get rid of cellulitis
[2131.08 - 2135.58] that's incredible I always say that some
[2133.72 - 2137.68] people only need celery juice just to
[2135.58 - 2139.00] get rid of one thing by the way I'm in
[2137.68 - 2140.68] Clinton Hill you guys if you don't have
[2139.00 - 2142.30] the book you're missing out
[2140.68 - 2144.34] it's
[2142.30 - 2146.50] by far
[2144.34 - 2148.54] one of the most powerful books in health
[2146.50 - 2150.58] out there in the world today
[2148.54 - 2152.68] Millions
[2150.58 - 2155.56] have gotten this book in their hands and
[2152.68 - 2156.76] moved themselves forward and got rid of
[2155.56 - 2160.50] some of the most
[2156.76 - 2160.50] crippling conditions
[2160.66 - 2165.30] okay
[2162.16 - 2165.30] let's roll a little bit
[2167.02 - 2171.28] once the fat has soaked up the
[2169.24 - 2174.52] adrenaline the stress hormone becomes
[2171.28 - 2176.74] trapped in our fat cells fat cells that
[2174.52 - 2179.32] then become part of us as they take up
[2176.74 - 2181.18] residents inside our organs so we got
[2179.32 - 2183.34] this adrenaline that's taking up
[2181.18 - 2185.86] residence because it's in a fat cell
[2183.34 - 2188.38] it's building up inner organs and
[2185.86 - 2190.54] there's information of fear and shame
[2188.38 - 2193.72] and guilt and chaos and triggers and
[2190.54 - 2196.00] PTSD all wrapped up in there and that's
[2193.72 - 2198.82] how cleansing how critical cleansing is
[2196.00 - 2201.82] to help get rid of and push that out of
[2198.82 - 2204.70] our body how incredible is that
[2201.82 - 2209.04] Kim Miller I get sick every time I'm in
[2204.70 - 2209.04] a new relationship I always wondered why
[2209.32 - 2214.96] there's yeah there's so much involved in
[2212.92 - 2217.30] that but we can't be afraid of a new
[2214.96 - 2220.96] relationship we can't be afraid
[2217.30 - 2223.84] of being with people of seeking love and
[2220.96 - 2226.42] finding partnership and partners we
[2223.84 - 2228.58] can't be afraid of that we have to live
[2226.42 - 2229.66] our lives people have to live their
[2228.58 - 2232.96] lives
[2229.66 - 2236.14] there's a soul mate waiting for someone
[2232.96 - 2239.26] who doesn't already have one
[2236.14 - 2241.90] all important things but knowing what to
[2239.26 - 2243.76] do if you get sick because you find this
[2241.90 - 2246.70] most amazing person in the world and you
[2243.76 - 2248.98] get sick but you can do something
[2246.70 - 2251.08] health-wise
[2248.98 - 2253.00] and you can make a choice on how to heal
[2251.08 - 2255.10] yourself but knowing what you're up
[2253.00 - 2257.44] against health-wise is good idea too to
[2255.10 - 2259.72] make a choice as well it's like okay
[2257.44 - 2261.28] I know what I'm up against I can do
[2259.72 - 2263.52] things there's things I can do for
[2261.28 - 2263.52] myself
[2268.30 - 2272.50] here's the key Point adrenaline holds
[2270.46 - 2274.72] information in the case of adrenaline
[2272.50 - 2277.42] that was released at highly emotional
[2274.72 - 2279.88] times it holds information about fear
[2277.42 - 2282.22] hurt betrayal injury or stress overload
[2279.88 - 2285.42] we experience in that moment so I know I
[2282.22 - 2285.42] was I was saying that anyway
[2286.36 - 2290.56] you guys today is day one of the medical
[2288.94 - 2292.90] medium collecting Stones meditation
[2290.56 - 2295.66] Journey
[2292.90 - 2298.68] I hope you're signed up it's going to be
[2295.66 - 2298.68] an incredible seven days
[2299.14 - 2303.72] you're never gonna forget it it's going
[2300.88 - 2303.72] to be life-changing
[2307.06 - 2310.90] Cold Light spring says I'm perfectly
[2308.86 - 2313.98] fine with being afraid of a new
[2310.90 - 2313.98] relationship laugh out loud
[2315.04 - 2317.22] um
[2317.74 - 2322.12] Brett Winters
[2319.78 - 2324.82] how are you Brett
[2322.12 - 2326.98] eating fat releases adrenaline to thin
[2324.82 - 2329.20] out our blood but it also soaks up
[2326.98 - 2330.46] adrenaline explain indeed so you're
[2329.20 - 2333.70] talking about medical meme information
[2330.46 - 2335.14] so what happens is that when we eat a
[2333.70 - 2337.96] lot of fat
[2335.14 - 2340.24] it takes adrenaline to try to become a
[2337.96 - 2342.46] blood thinner for that fat so if you're
[2340.24 - 2344.56] eating tacos load it with you know
[2342.46 - 2346.42] greasy fat you're eating pizzas you're
[2344.56 - 2348.88] eating fried or you're eating buffalo
[2346.42 - 2351.88] chicken wings
[2348.88 - 2353.86] in a bar somewhere whatever you're
[2351.88 - 2357.10] eating these things
[2353.86 - 2359.92] you're eating pulled pork sandwiches
[2357.10 - 2362.62] mac and cheese whatever it is all that
[2359.92 - 2366.40] fat that butter or that oil that grease
[2362.62 - 2368.68] that animal fat or plant fat too A lot
[2366.40 - 2372.10] of people take a ton of plant fat right
[2368.68 - 2376.06] so all of that fat
[2372.10 - 2377.56] is there we innately eat all of that to
[2376.06 - 2379.36] sop up
[2377.56 - 2382.30] the adrenaline
[2379.36 - 2385.54] right that's the Comfort zop up
[2382.30 - 2389.14] but Brett at the same time all that fat
[2385.54 - 2391.84] we're eating is releasing adrenaline
[2389.14 - 2394.12] to try to blood thin it so to try to do
[2391.84 - 2396.04] like a blood thinner so we don't get a
[2394.12 - 2399.70] heart attack so we don't stroke out so
[2396.04 - 2401.68] we don't get a a clog
[2399.70 - 2403.42] so we can get oxygen to our brain
[2401.68 - 2405.70] because the more fat we eat the less
[2403.42 - 2407.80] oxygen we get to our brain
[2405.70 - 2411.00] mm info
[2407.80 - 2411.00] I have to say that now
[2411.46 - 2417.88] imagine that
[2413.14 - 2420.34] the world we've we now live in okay
[2417.88 - 2422.56] so when that happens
[2420.34 - 2425.74] that occurs too so it's a vicious cycle
[2422.56 - 2427.54] it's a catch-22 exactly that but keep in
[2425.74 - 2428.92] mind this
[2427.54 - 2430.42] when we're not going through an
[2428.92 - 2433.18] emotional hardship we're not going
[2430.42 - 2436.60] through a stress moment or a big Trigger
[2433.18 - 2437.80] or PTSD everybody is still eating fat
[2436.60 - 2439.90] because they're addicted to the
[2437.80 - 2442.54] adrenaline cycle the adren adrenaline
[2439.90 - 2444.16] surge so they can't break away from all
[2442.54 - 2446.86] that cacao
[2444.16 - 2449.50] that fatty cacao they can't break away
[2446.86 - 2451.66] from those cupcakes and the donuts they
[2449.50 - 2453.46] can't break away from the vegan donuts
[2451.66 - 2455.20] and vegan cupcakes and the pizzas and
[2453.46 - 2456.82] the vegan pizzas they love the vegan
[2455.20 - 2458.80] pizzas because they're loaded with oil
[2456.82 - 2460.24] there's no fat free vegan pizza in a
[2458.80 - 2462.04] restaurant
[2460.24 - 2464.92] excuse me um
[2462.04 - 2469.66] I see you offer vegan pizzas here in the
[2464.92 - 2473.14] restaurant yeah I am a person who would
[2469.66 - 2475.54] really like a vegan pizza right now I
[2473.14 - 2477.76] have been plant-based for a while and I
[2475.54 - 2481.54] want a treat so I'm going to get myself
[2477.76 - 2483.52] a big vegan pizza oh
[2481.54 - 2485.62] um I'm sorry can you make that vegan
[2483.52 - 2489.58] pizza fat free
[2485.62 - 2491.26] I'm sorry excuse me fat free what does
[2489.58 - 2493.72] that mean
[2491.26 - 2497.68] um your pizzas aren't fat free
[2493.72 - 2499.60] huh what um okay well
[2497.68 - 2500.92] um make sure there's no vegan cheese on
[2499.60 - 2502.60] there because vegan cheese is filled
[2500.92 - 2505.30] with fat do you have vegan cheese on the
[2502.60 - 2507.58] pizza oh you do whoa okay then there's
[2505.30 - 2509.80] your fat wait olive oil's on your pizza
[2507.58 - 2512.26] too you drizzle it with olive oil oh
[2509.80 - 2514.18] there's more fat on that pizza wait a
[2512.26 - 2517.30] minute you have a crust that has what in
[2514.18 - 2520.12] it oh and there's more of that too
[2517.30 - 2522.04] so either way we might be in the
[2520.12 - 2524.14] situation where like I'm hankering for
[2522.04 - 2526.78] that vegan pizza because I want to do a
[2524.14 - 2528.82] fat bomb drop it into my bloodstream and
[2526.78 - 2530.68] then I don't know it and I have no idea
[2528.82 - 2532.00] but I'm gonna have an adrenaline surge
[2530.68 - 2534.82] baby and it's going to be an adrenaline
[2532.00 - 2537.10] High because whoa right before I bite

[2572.08 - 2575.62] cheese pizza even if it's a vegan pizza

[2605.56 - 2609.34] out there already when it didn't even
[2607.24 - 2612.16] exist right it comes from these books
[2609.34 - 2614.02] they steal it they don't cite it
[2612.16 - 2616.84] it's like what makes a person do that
[2614.02 - 2618.64] please tell me somebody is that an
[2616.84 - 2620.98] Integrity issue
[2618.64 - 2625.48] it takes time getting off the addictions
[2620.98 - 2628.24] getting off of the the MSG in foods
[2625.48 - 2630.88] the MSG in restaurant Foods the high
[2628.24 - 2632.80] levels of salt the chemicals in foods
[2630.88 - 2635.74] and the coffees and the coffee drinks
[2632.80 - 2637.90] takes time to reset the taste buds
[2635.74 - 2640.36] it takes time
[2637.90 - 2642.16] of course you're going to be happy and
[2640.36 - 2643.96] high when you eat those Foods you're
[2642.16 - 2647.14] going to be really high
[2643.96 - 2648.46] and they just taste so good in the
[2647.14 - 2650.56] moment
[2648.46 - 2652.66] it's not the same at home in the
[2650.56 - 2654.76] restaurant they're packing it with MSG
[2652.66 - 2658.06] too when you go out and get your vegan
[2654.76 - 2660.22] pizza things loaded with MSG you just
[2658.06 - 2661.42] don't know it but it's loaded versus
[2660.22 - 2663.40] when you're at home and you're making
[2661.42 - 2665.38] steamed potatoes
[2663.40 - 2668.62] and you're like well I got my steamed
[2665.38 - 2671.38] potato dish from medical mediums book I
[2668.62 - 2673.18] got this I like my steamed potato dish
[2671.38 - 2675.04] but it's not the same thing as when I
[2673.18 - 2676.84] was with my friend and I was in a vegan
[2675.04 - 2680.32] restaurant and we had those vegan cheese
[2676.84 - 2684.78] pizzas and damn that was good tasted so
[2680.32 - 2684.78] good whoa was incredible
[2684.82 - 2689.64] you ever wonder why Foods don't taste
[2687.16 - 2689.64] the same
[2690.34 - 2694.24] when you're making them at home versus
[2692.38 - 2697.66] when you're in restaurants or eating out
[2694.24 - 2700.12] of packages food packages they're laced
[2697.66 - 2702.06] with undisclosed ingredients all the
[2700.12 - 2704.02] time

[2780.64 - 2786.64] a hundred percent
[2783.10 - 2790.06] now I want to be fully raw I am afraid
[2786.64 - 2794.64] of detoxing in the form
[2790.06 - 2794.64] of acne what can I do about it
[2794.80 - 2800.26] okay we can't live in fear
[2798.40 - 2801.88] it's just part of being here on planet
[2800.26 - 2803.98] mess
[2801.88 - 2805.30] part of being here in plant stress
[2803.98 - 2808.78] planet Earth
[2805.30 - 2810.22] okay we can't live in fear right moving
[2808.78 - 2811.96] forward with our health and doing the
[2810.22 - 2814.36] right things
[2811.96 - 2819.88] is always important to do
[2814.36 - 2822.88] and we can't be afraid
[2819.88 - 2825.34] but if you're doing the morning cleanse
[2822.88 - 2827.08] and you're getting relief incredible
[2825.34 - 2828.64] then that's what you do
[2827.08 - 2831.10] there's nothing wrong with that you can
[2828.64 - 2833.20] go slower you can do it in with an ease
[2831.10 - 2834.82] you can add little things in at a time
[2833.20 - 2836.56] when you read the medical medium books
[2834.82 - 2838.78] you can talk to your doctor too about
[2836.56 - 2841.18] what you feel is good or your doctor
[2838.78 - 2842.98] feels as good I mean but you can take it
[2841.18 - 2845.20] baby steps you can just do morning
[2842.98 - 2847.42] cleanses and morning cleanses it is and
[2845.20 - 2848.92] only that and that's all you do that's
[2847.42 - 2850.78] fine
[2848.92 - 2852.52] and if things are in a great place
[2850.78 - 2854.44] because of that then that's where you
[2852.52 - 2855.88] are
[2854.44 - 2857.86] so yeah
[2855.88 - 2859.30] and a lot of a lot of times with acne a
[2857.86 - 2861.04] lot of people they're just trapped in it
[2859.30 - 2863.86] and they have to push through to get to
[2861.04 - 2866.02] the other side takes time for a lot of
[2863.86 - 2867.40] different people but a lot of people it
[2866.02 - 2869.02] could just be like yeah you're doing
[2867.40 - 2871.60] that one thing celery juice or a morning
[2869.02 - 2874.62] cleanse and that's what you're doing and
[2871.60 - 2874.62] you're in a good place
[2881.92 - 2887.32] note not everything is detox too I I
[2885.46 - 2890.50] apologize by the way that I haven't
[2887.32 - 2893.32] gotten the medical medium Detox episode
[2890.50 - 2898.08] out on the medical meme podcast
[2893.32 - 2898.08] letting you know I've been working on it
[2898.30 - 2902.56] I have I have
[2900.04 - 2905.20] and I'm going to work on a lot of
[2902.56 - 2907.06] episodes too with medical meme podcasts
[2905.20 - 2909.70] just mind-blowing stuff
[2907.06 - 2913.14] like for the next few months like
[2909.70 - 2913.14] seriously some great stuff
[2916.84 - 2919.96] what happens is if you have strep
[2918.40 - 2921.46] bacteria a lot of times when people
[2919.96 - 2923.98] cleanse
[2921.46 - 2925.78] that strep is dying off that strep is
[2923.98 - 2928.06] actually clearing out of the system it's
[2925.78 - 2929.74] moving out of your system you're
[2928.06 - 2932.56] starving that strep
[2929.74 - 2935.20] but a lot of times you know acne can be
[2932.56 - 2937.48] a detox
[2935.20 - 2939.82] in the sense where if you're killing off
[2937.48 - 2941.68] a whole bunch of it
[2939.82 - 2944.14] keep that in mind so a lot of people
[2941.68 - 2946.00] I've seen where and straps a really good
[2944.14 - 2948.70] topic right now a lot of people they'll
[2946.00 - 2950.44] have three or four or even 10 varieties
[2948.70 - 2952.12] of strep in their system they're just
[2950.44 - 2953.20] loaded it's all through their intestinal
[2952.12 - 2956.20] tract
[2953.20 - 2957.88] I just riddled in their intestinal tract
[2956.20 - 2959.62] it's in their liver it's all in their
[2957.88 - 2961.84] lymphatic system they got acne on their
[2959.62 - 2964.12] chest they got acne on their back acne
[2961.84 - 2966.10] on their neck they got acne on their
[2964.12 - 2968.80] temples they acne on their face their
[2966.10 - 2971.44] nose are just loaded with acne they got
[2968.80 - 2973.90] a lot of strep in them they got
[2971.44 - 2976.90] um antibiotic resistant varieties of
[2973.90 - 2979.84] acne in them and the minute you start
[2976.90 - 2981.70] dumping stuff in there to just keep
[2979.84 - 2983.98] basically you're killing off the strep
[2981.70 - 2985.84] there's a lot of toxins coming from the
[2983.98 - 2987.46] bacterias as you know as it's also
[2985.84 - 2989.80] exploding that can happen too if
[2987.46 - 2992.16] someone's so fully loaded what I mean so
[2989.80 - 2994.78] fully loaded people got diverticulosis
[2992.16 - 2997.18] diverticulitis they got styes they got
[2994.78 - 2998.14] UTIs constantly there's people out there
[2997.18 - 3000.78] though
[2998.14 - 3003.18] literally shrep is running their whole
[3000.78 - 3005.28] life and we got to push it out of them
[3003.18 - 3007.08] if you have strep bacteria
[3005.28 - 3010.14] you'll have acne at some point in your
[3007.08 - 3012.60] life that's not detox it's just a
[3010.14 - 3015.60] symptom of strep bacteria
[3012.60 - 3017.94] you will get acne one day if you have
[3015.60 - 3020.46] strep we can't blame everything on detox
[3017.94 - 3021.66] that gets people in trouble it does get
[3020.46 - 3023.88] people in trouble when we blame
[3021.66 - 3025.92] everything on detox too well a lot of
[3023.88 - 3028.32] people don't realize if they have strep
[3025.92 - 3030.30] they'll have acne at some point in their
[3028.32 - 3032.64] life if they have strep so that that's
[3030.30 - 3034.08] important to keep in mind too but there
[3032.64 - 3037.32] is this thing
[3034.08 - 3040.80] as I was saying before if someone's so
[3037.32 - 3043.38] loaded with so many varieties
[3040.80 - 3045.06] and now we're pulling Foods away from
[3043.38 - 3047.58] that strep
[3045.06 - 3049.80] and we're releasing all that old stored
[3047.58 - 3052.44] up antibiotics that they took for years
[3049.80 - 3054.60] that's in their liver and we're moving
[3052.44 - 3057.00] all this stuff about
[3054.60 - 3058.56] yeah I mean they can they can just be
[3057.00 - 3060.54] sitting there with their acne that
[3058.56 - 3062.40] they've had all along until it finally
[3060.54 - 3064.38] starts clearing up blaming everything
[3062.40 - 3066.96] though on detox
[3064.38 - 3069.20] came outside of the medical medium
[3066.96 - 3069.20] community
[3069.30 - 3072.90] people who don't know what the true
[3071.04 - 3073.98] causes of their symptoms and conditions
[3072.90 - 3076.14] are
[3073.98 - 3078.24] that's an important note for anybody
[3076.14 - 3080.46] who's paying attention anybody who's
[3078.24 - 3082.32] listening that's a really critical note
[3080.46 - 3084.84] right there blaming everything on detox
[3082.32 - 3086.40] is not a medical medium Community thing
[3084.84 - 3088.62] or medical medium books and information
[3086.40 - 3090.84] thing I think everything's just blamed
[3088.62 - 3093.30] on detox oh that's detox oh what's that
[3090.84 - 3095.42] that's detox oh that's detox first of
[3093.30 - 3095.42] all
[3096.14 - 3102.66] that's just not correct the correct way
[3100.20 - 3105.66] it should be handled
[3102.66 - 3107.76] that's just a term a blanket statement
[3105.66 - 3109.20] and term that was created because people
[3107.76 - 3110.70] don't know why people are sick and
[3109.20 - 3112.74] what's wrong with them and that came
[3110.70 - 3114.72] from outside of the community
[3112.74 - 3117.90] that's where that came from from people
[3114.72 - 3119.82] that did not know influencers or whoever
[3117.90 - 3122.40] are practitioners that did not know why
[3119.82 - 3123.72] someone had a symptom or condition so
[3122.40 - 3125.82] they'll start blaming everything about
[3123.72 - 3127.14] detox Pathways that are being clogged
[3125.82 - 3129.30] they'll be like oh that's because your
[3127.14 - 3130.56] detox pathways are being clogged that's
[3129.30 - 3132.24] because you don't know your detox
[3130.56 - 3133.80] Pathways really do you know your detox
[3132.24 - 3136.62] pathways
[3133.80 - 3140.22] you know acne for example acne is not
[3136.62 - 3143.28] because your detox pathways are clogged
[3140.22 - 3145.38] it's because you have strep
[3143.28 - 3147.18] all this is important information for so
[3145.38 - 3149.40] many people that are looking for this
[3147.18 - 3151.14] these tidbits
[3149.40 - 3153.90] as I see out there people do ask about
[3151.14 - 3155.64] it I've seen a lot of questions
[3153.90 - 3157.50] so keep in mind the whole blame
[3155.64 - 3160.26] everything on detox is not a medical
[3157.50 - 3162.60] medium thing if you read all eight
[3160.26 - 3164.64] medical textbooks
[3162.60 - 3166.20] you're not going to see riddled all
[3164.64 - 3168.36] through these eight medical textbooks
[3166.20 - 3170.40] that everything's detox and everything
[3168.36 - 3172.26] everything is detox just blame
[3170.40 - 3174.00] everything on there blame that symptom
[3172.26 - 3175.44] that condition on detox you're not going
[3174.00 - 3177.36] to see that you look through the
[3175.44 - 3180.42] symptoms and conditions of all these
[3177.36 - 3183.12] diseases and symptoms right of all these
[3180.42 - 3186.18] conditions and illnesses and sicknesses
[3183.12 - 3190.32] in these books you don't see a blanket
[3186.18 - 3193.02] thing oh that's detox oh that's detox
[3190.32 - 3194.34] nerve pain isn't your detox Pathways
[3193.02 - 3197.10] clogged
[3194.34 - 3198.12] it's viral it's injuries it's all kinds
[3197.10 - 3200.64] of stuff but it's not your detox
[3198.12 - 3202.80] Pathways clogged I'm giving you just a
[3200.64 - 3205.14] little tidbit of what would be in the
[3202.80 - 3207.74] medical medium detox
[3205.14 - 3207.74] podcast
[3212.82 - 3217.34] don't mind I am going to sip a little
[3215.04 - 3217.34] bit here
[3219.48 - 3221.90] okay
[3223.20 - 3226.56] let's also not forget about the other
[3224.88 - 3228.18] school of emotions and eating I just
[3226.56 - 3230.58] want to cover the other school because I
[3228.18 - 3233.40] feel bad I only covered the first school
[3230.58 - 3235.50] the one school can I cover the other
[3233.40 - 3238.40] school do we do we have time to do this
[3235.50 - 3238.40] get ready for this
[3239.16 - 3245.88] on IG acne also can be caused by thick
[3242.64 - 3248.06] bile sludge check about it
[3245.88 - 3251.70] really because science doesn't know that
[3248.06 - 3254.16] research doesn't know that
[3251.70 - 3256.86] there's nothing out there there's no
[3254.16 - 3259.26] there's no study
[3256.86 - 3261.78] there's no microscope anybody stuck up
[3259.26 - 3264.06] somebody's ass or a microscope that they
[3261.78 - 3265.80] stuck in somebody's throat or a
[3264.06 - 3267.96] microscope they stuck into their body
[3265.80 - 3271.08] and into their veins or down into the
[3267.96 - 3273.42] liver that said oh thick bile that must
[3271.08 - 3275.64] be why you have acne that doesn't exist
[3273.42 - 3277.32] so there's that's just made up because
[3275.64 - 3279.12] there's no signs of research this has
[3277.32 - 3280.68] ever discovered that that could be why
[3279.12 - 3285.26] acne really is
[3280.68 - 3285.26] acne is instead an actual infection
[3285.90 - 3290.34] so keep that in mind it's it's an
[3288.30 - 3292.50] infection it's like a pushed wall an
[3290.34 - 3295.32] actual infection
[3292.50 - 3297.36] it's an infection
[3295.32 - 3299.54] it's not thick bile or anything like
[3297.36 - 3299.54] that
[3300.96 - 3304.28] so I just want to cover that
[3304.44 - 3308.82] let's also not forget about the other
[3306.24 - 3311.10] school of emotions and eating in this
[3308.82 - 3315.24] school are folks who prefer to avoid
[3311.10 - 3317.46] food when they're in pain emotionally
[3315.24 - 3319.62] so they avoid the food they're not
[3317.46 - 3322.32] running to comfort Foods they're not
[3319.62 - 3324.30] shoving down a pizza they're not pushing
[3322.32 - 3328.14] something deep down inside
[3324.30 - 3330.54] so this is a group of people that shut
[3328.14 - 3334.62] off the spigot they're just like no I'm
[3330.54 - 3336.72] not gonna eat I'm not gonna eat
[3334.62 - 3338.70] in this school are folks who prefer to
[3336.72 - 3341.58] avoid food when they're in emotional
[3338.70 - 3343.56] pain often triggered because their
[3341.58 - 3347.28] emotions have taken away their appetite
[3343.56 - 3350.52] or made them feel sick I'm so sick from
[3347.28 - 3353.22] that betrayal oh my God I'm sick I gotta
[3350.52 - 3354.48] pull this knife out of my back
[3353.22 - 3357.42] and
[3354.48 - 3360.54] I just can't eat right now I'm so
[3357.42 - 3363.42] disgusted I'm so upset I'm so angry I'm
[3360.54 - 3366.00] so emotional I'm in so much pain
[3363.42 - 3367.92] emotionally I can't handle it I can't
[3366.00 - 3369.90] eat there's no way I'm putting food in
[3367.92 - 3373.26] my stomach right now there's no freaking
[3369.90 - 3377.12] way I'm ever gonna stick food in my
[3373.26 - 3377.12] stomach right now when I'm upset
[3378.24 - 3383.52] this approach can turn into an addiction
[3380.40 - 3384.96] to having no appetite it can I've seen a
[3383.52 - 3387.42] lot of people they're emotionally hit
[3384.96 - 3388.86] every minute every which way and they
[3387.42 - 3391.44] just can't eat
[3388.86 - 3394.52] so it becomes an addiction
[3391.44 - 3394.52] to not eat
[3398.58 - 3403.62] over there in IG yes that's me I stop
[3401.40 - 3406.74] eating
[3403.62 - 3409.32] um start the Gypsy medium
[3406.74 - 3412.26] and then Rainbow Bright says so there is
[3409.32 - 3414.92] no detox acne just an ongoing infection
[3412.26 - 3414.92] correct
[3418.38 - 3422.94] yes it's always because of strep if you
[3421.56 - 3424.98] are cleansing it
[3422.94 - 3428.36] there can be some die off but it's
[3424.98 - 3428.36] caused by strep either way
[3432.36 - 3436.80] I can't tell you how many people have
[3434.10 - 3438.96] used mm info completely I've gotten rid
[3436.80 - 3441.00] of their strep debilitating strep
[3438.96 - 3442.74] covered their whole body
[3441.00 - 3446.10] gotten rid of it
[3442.74 - 3448.26] use the protocols made sure they weren't
[3446.10 - 3451.38] feeding it with the the you know the
[3448.26 - 3453.06] foods that will feed it right making
[3451.38 - 3455.64] sure they do all that and then they get
[3453.06 - 3458.28] into a new relationship
[3455.64 - 3460.44] they pick up a brand new strap or two
[3458.28 - 3462.06] and they start getting some other form
[3460.44 - 3463.80] of acne
[3462.06 - 3465.36] and then they have to do it again have
[3463.80 - 3466.92] to clean up and make sure you know
[3465.36 - 3468.66] they're fighting to clean it up and do
[3466.92 - 3469.86] the right protocols and boom get rid of
[3468.66 - 3473.60] it
[3469.86 - 3476.10] journey sg1 I am going to read
[3473.60 - 3480.60] that comment there
[3476.10 - 3484.08] acne is also said to be hormones yes
[3480.60 - 3485.64] it's said to be hormones no it's not
[3484.08 - 3487.56] hormones now there's going to be a bunch
[3485.64 - 3489.60] of people that say okay that he just
[3487.56 - 3492.24] lost me there he lost me it's hormones
[3489.60 - 3495.24] hormones hormones hormones hormones
[3492.24 - 3498.36] people don't realize is that strep Ebbs
[3495.24 - 3500.82] and flows with the immune system
[3498.36 - 3504.12] and so with women their immune system
[3500.82 - 3506.76] drops during their cycle it drops during
[3504.12 - 3509.46] menstruation it drops during ovulation
[3506.76 - 3513.42] it drops during pregnancies and
[3509.46 - 3517.20] childbirth it drops monthly
[3513.42 - 3517.86] it drops during puberty with
[3517.20 - 3521.10] um
[3517.86 - 3522.36] with both both and what happened here's
[3521.10 - 3524.04] what's important so here's what's
[3522.36 - 3527.10] interesting
[3524.04 - 3529.20] anytime there's an anytime there is a
[3527.10 - 3530.94] hormone change
[3529.20 - 3534.00] keep that in mind
[3530.94 - 3536.16] whether it's puberty or menstruation or
[3534.00 - 3538.76] ovulation
[3536.16 - 3542.70] or something happening
[3538.76 - 3545.22] hormonally right a hormonal change the
[3542.70 - 3548.10] immune system drops and for women the
[3545.22 - 3550.62] immune system drops
[3548.10 - 3553.08] keep that in mind
[3550.62 - 3554.76] the Divine list says blaming hormone is
[3553.08 - 3558.02] propaganda to make women blame
[3554.76 - 3561.90] themselves that's true
[3558.02 - 3565.34] into the wild Blues yep I also break out
[3561.90 - 3565.34] with acne when I'm sick
[3565.74 - 3571.64] yep I always break out with acne when
[3569.28 - 3571.64] I'm sick
[3572.82 - 3577.02] so what happens is that we break out
[3575.04 - 3579.36] with acne because when we're sick the
[3577.02 - 3581.52] immune system drops and then strep Rises
[3579.36 - 3583.20] up very important to know that like
[3581.52 - 3584.46] that's how it works strep is always an
[3583.20 - 3586.38] infection
[3584.46 - 3589.98] it's always inside our body living in
[3586.38 - 3592.08] our body it's an ongoing strep infection
[3589.98 - 3595.32] when we when our immune system is
[3592.08 - 3597.18] compromised like say betrayal or an
[3595.32 - 3599.72] adrenaline surge because we're totally
[3597.18 - 3604.02] stressed out from something
[3599.72 - 3605.10] yeah adrenaline hormonal immune system
[3604.02 - 3608.10] drops
[3605.10 - 3609.54] strep acts up and Rises
[3608.10 - 3612.60] menstruation
[3609.54 - 3615.72] immune system drops in women strep Rises
[3612.60 - 3617.22] up so that's why there was a connect the
[3615.72 - 3619.70] dots
[3617.22 - 3624.36] from mainstream medicine
[3619.70 - 3627.24] mainstream medicine said that acne is
[3624.36 - 3631.38] caused by hormones mainstream medicine
[3627.24 - 3633.36] was only noting that it happened to a
[3631.38 - 3635.22] lot of people when there was a hormone
[3633.36 - 3638.10] shift
[3635.22 - 3639.96] acne rose up but did not know why
[3638.10 - 3643.40] because the immune system drops and then
[3639.96 - 3643.40] strep gets stronger
[3647.58 - 3653.88] so much information
[3650.48 - 3655.80] I can't stop myself I said it keeps on
[3653.88 - 3657.36] coming out
[3655.80 - 3658.38] yeah
[3657.36 - 3660.42] okay
[3658.38 - 3665.60] so there's a whole bunch of people that
[3660.42 - 3665.60] literally say my life is out of control
[3665.88 - 3671.82] my life is out of control I just my PTSD
[3669.24 - 3676.08] is out of control I just got hurt again
[3671.82 - 3678.36] my trust was broken I was betrayed
[3676.08 - 3680.10] I just got into a confrontation I just
[3678.36 - 3682.56] people don't understand me I'm not
[3680.10 - 3683.82] understood I'm not validated no one
[3682.56 - 3685.92] understands me
[3683.82 - 3688.08] I'm not going to eat because guess what
[3685.92 - 3690.18] I can't control other people and I can't
[3688.08 - 3692.22] control the crap happening to me and I
[3690.18 - 3694.08] can't control the difficult time I'm in
[3692.22 - 3696.24] I can't control the relationship that
[3694.08 - 3697.80] was you know my boyfriend just broke up
[3696.24 - 3699.60] with me or my girlfriend just broke up
[3697.80 - 3703.26] with me I can't control any of it so
[3699.60 - 3705.96] what I can control is food
[3703.26 - 3708.12] so if I can't control anything else I'm
[3705.96 - 3711.60] definitely not eating because I will
[3708.12 - 3713.94] definitely not eat because I will
[3711.60 - 3716.28] control my eating I will control my food
[3713.94 - 3718.68] I am going to use that
[3716.28 - 3720.90] I'm sick I don't want to eat I'm sick of
[3718.68 - 3722.94] my stomach I don't want to eat so I am
[3720.90 - 3724.62] now going to be like no I can't control
[3722.94 - 3727.22] anything else out there so I'm going to
[3724.62 - 3727.22] control my food
[3729.12 - 3732.54] they already feel that they don't have
[3730.86 - 3734.40] control over their environment or
[3732.54 - 3736.44] situations happening around them or
[3734.40 - 3739.26] people in their life and so whether
[3736.44 - 3742.26] consciously or subconsciously they try
[3739.26 - 3745.50] to exert extreme control over what they
[3742.26 - 3747.90] put into their mouths
[3745.50 - 3750.18] people from the other school those who
[3747.90 - 3752.28] overeat often struggle with loss of
[3750.18 - 3753.54] control too they happen to have a
[3752.28 - 3756.12] different way of dealing with the
[3753.54 - 3758.58] sensation for those who withhold food
[3756.12 - 3760.62] while food cravings may still surface
