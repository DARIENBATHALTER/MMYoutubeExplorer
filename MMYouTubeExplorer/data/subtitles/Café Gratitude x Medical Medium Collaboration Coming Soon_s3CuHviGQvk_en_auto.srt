00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,399
the medical medium recipes that were

there which is amazing easy on the salt

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,479
you know what happens is when you eat in

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,000
a restaurant and you get filled up a lot

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,280
of things can happen afterwards you can

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
feel like okay now I'm starving again

36
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,960
shortly after and then you feel kind of

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
like ripped off because you just ate and

38
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,320

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,200
