1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm sure you've heard about the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,160
paranormal triangles, the Alaska

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,639
triangle and the Bermuda Triangle and

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,480
many more. Now, not all the triangles

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,240
that people are talking about out there

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,160
are legit. People are looking for

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,080
triangles. They're interested. They want

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,520
many triangles out there, and there are

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,320
many, but not every triangle people say

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
is a triangle is a mysterious paranormal

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,560
triangle. And one of the things is

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,719
paranormal triangles aren't just

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,960
triangle. They're circles. They've been

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,239
identified and estimated as

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,480
triangles. They've been noted as

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,320
triangles, documented as triangles, but

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,079
in reality, not all of them are

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,000
triangles. They're actually circles.

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
They're areas that are actually

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
circular. And in these paranormal

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,199
triangles, which are actually circular,

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
at least most of them are, there's a lot

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,760
of UFO sightings. There's a lot of

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,320
sightings of light beams, of light

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,640
circles, of crafts, of

26
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,400
spaceships, also

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,040
disappearances, missing ships, missing

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,760
planes over the last 100 years. So,

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,200
where do chemtrails and geoengineering

30
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,680
trails fall into this? Where do these

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,680
play a role?
