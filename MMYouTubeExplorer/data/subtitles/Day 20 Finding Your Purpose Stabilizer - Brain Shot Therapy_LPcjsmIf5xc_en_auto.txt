[0.00 - 3.12] therapies don't always taste good
[1.74 - 7.32] because it's just about the medicine
[3.12 - 10.86] right but this one I happen to like I do
[7.32 - 12.84] love this brain shot very much I use it
[10.86 - 14.82] very much we're also going to talk about
[12.84 - 18.00] micro dosing today
[14.82 - 20.22] get ready for that you might want to
[18.00 - 23.04] fasten your seat belts get your seat
[20.22 - 24.42] belts on click them in
[23.04 - 26.16] because we're gonna be talking about
[24.42 - 28.98] micro dosing
[26.16 - 30.84] talking about micro dosing is definitely
[28.98 - 33.72] going to piss a bunch of people off but
[30.84 - 36.00] that's okay because I don't know I just
[33.72 - 37.26] gotta say the words from message the
[36.00 - 38.46] words from above and we'll see what
[37.26 - 41.40] happens
[38.46 - 43.92] hopefully everybody's strapped in and
[41.40 - 45.90] ready for the ride but today is about
[43.92 - 49.32] finding
[45.90 - 55.56] your true purpose stabilizer
[49.32 - 58.26] day 20. oh my God day 20. okay
[55.56 - 60.42] how many of you guys have gone 20 days
[58.26 - 63.48] and if you haven't like I said yesterday
[60.42 - 64.74] it's okay go three days five days that's
[63.48 - 67.82] okay
[64.74 - 69.72] but how many of you have gotten 20 days
[67.82 - 72.90] we are
[69.72 - 74.70] on the 20th day incredible finding a
[72.90 - 76.68] purpose stabilizer I am making it today
[74.70 - 79.44] I got my berries in front of me I got
[76.68 - 81.54] the right well blueberry powder I got
[79.44 - 84.78] the parsley in front of me I'm ready to
[81.54 - 86.10] go let's talk about microdosing and
[84.78 - 87.36] we're also going to talk about the soil
[86.10 - 91.88] I want to prepare you we're going to do
[87.36 - 91.88] a little bit of some soul talking too
[92.36 - 96.24] psychedelics
[94.20 - 98.40] that are considered plant medicine have
[96.24 - 101.04] gained popularity recently with the
[98.40 - 102.72] theory that everything is okay if you
[101.04 - 105.12] micro dose it
[102.72 - 107.22] don't worry everything's okay you're
[105.12 - 109.70] micro dosing it right that's the theory
[107.22 - 109.70] out there
[110.34 - 115.38] now we're very confused in the health
[112.80 - 117.66] World about what plant medicine actually
[115.38 - 121.20] is
[117.66 - 124.02] it's a trend to take something toxic and
[121.20 - 126.20] put the term plant medicine in front of
[124.02 - 126.20] it
[126.24 - 131.64] so what the trend is is you take
[128.46 - 134.40] something that's toxic to the brain
[131.64 - 136.80] damaging to the brain and then place the
[134.40 - 137.88] words plant medicine in front of that
[136.80 - 139.74] toxin
[137.88 - 142.08] and then it's okay
[139.74 - 144.78] now it's okay
[142.08 - 146.94] very interesting right
[144.78 - 148.98] it's a trend to take something toxic and
[146.94 - 152.82] put the term plant medicine in front of
[148.98 - 155.52] it as if that makes it not toxic or even
[152.82 - 157.92] not dangerous so when you stick plant
[155.52 - 160.62] medicine in front of something it makes
[157.92 - 163.86] it so it's like not toxic not dangerous
[160.62 - 166.92] not damaging to the brain
[163.86 - 169.16] totally fine
[166.92 - 172.50] are you guys sure you're ready for this
[169.16 - 174.96] on my page number 151
[172.50 - 177.00] and I'm in brain saver are you sure
[174.96 - 179.46] you're ready for this okay because I
[177.00 - 181.14] have not talked about micro dosing and
[179.46 - 182.82] we're doing a little bit on it right
[181.14 - 184.08] we're still going to do a lot more on it
[182.82 - 186.36] but right now we're going to cover some
[184.08 - 190.04] Erica Malik life after this challenge is
[186.36 - 190.04] going to feel a little empty
[192.36 - 195.56] it's over the 20 day
[197.10 - 203.10] the plant medicine label right
[200.40 - 206.04] plant medicine label
[203.10 - 208.02] is like an excuse to use plants that
[206.04 - 210.24] have chemical compounds that hinder our
[208.02 - 214.62] body hurt our body or set our healing
[210.24 - 217.10] back yes I said it set our healing back
[214.62 - 217.10] truth
[217.92 - 222.18] as long as we put it in that plant
[220.02 - 223.98] medicine category
[222.18 - 227.40] it's plant medicine
[223.98 - 229.92] a substance has immunity and is
[227.40 - 231.30] considered a safe viable way to heal so
[229.92 - 232.98] what's happening right now in the world
[231.30 - 234.84] of micro dosing in the world of plant
[232.98 - 238.44] medicine they're using the term plant
[234.84 - 242.58] medicine to safeify it
[238.44 - 245.16] to make it safe to safify it
[242.58 - 247.86] that's what they're doing now it's
[245.16 - 251.58] interesting really really the term plant
[247.86 - 254.16] medicine should be all about fruits
[251.58 - 256.32] that's plant medicine leafy greens
[254.16 - 260.36] that's plant medicine
[256.32 - 264.12] herbs uh-huh herbs
[260.36 - 267.06] wild foods and vegetables
[264.12 - 269.82] that are not mind altering
[267.06 - 274.50] or adrenaline surging that's remember
[269.82 - 277.38] that word right there adrenaline surging
[274.50 - 280.98] keep that in mind
[277.38 - 282.30] sources of plant chemical compounds
[280.98 - 285.36] so what's happening right now micro
[282.30 - 287.46] dosing is very trendy micro dosing plant
[285.36 - 290.52] medicine
[287.46 - 292.68] that's damaging to the adrenals is
[290.52 - 294.78] actually trendy right now
[292.68 - 296.88] that's not plant medicine that's just
[294.78 - 299.10] something toxic that hinders and damages
[296.88 - 301.88] the adrenals and the Brain
[299.10 - 301.88] and liver
[301.98 - 306.06] so really the term plant medicine should
[304.02 - 307.74] be all about fruits leafy greens herbs
[306.06 - 309.78] wild foods and vegetables that are not
[307.74 - 310.98] mind altering or adrenaline surging
[309.78 - 312.90] that's the next note right there get
[310.98 - 314.96] ready for that fashion your seatbelts on
[312.90 - 317.60] for this ride we're just starting
[314.96 - 320.70] we're just starting
[317.60 - 323.42] adrenaline surging
[320.70 - 325.20] that's what Ayahuasca plant medicine
[323.42 - 328.82] psilocybins a lot of other plant
[325.20 - 332.78] medicines do cacao
[328.82 - 332.78] adrenaline surging
[333.42 - 338.34] sure it's a fun ride for some not
[336.18 - 340.02] everybody it's a fun ride it's an
[338.34 - 342.18] adrenaline surging ride
[340.02 - 344.22] Aurora says can you explain what is
[342.18 - 346.80] microdosing microdosing is where they
[344.22 - 349.86] take something toxic like a psilocybin
[346.80 - 351.96] or right Ayahuasca or something
[349.86 - 355.26] I I can name some others too and I think
[351.96 - 357.72] I will and if you put it in smaller
[355.26 - 359.70] dosages because what happened with
[357.72 - 362.04] Ayahuasca is originally
[359.70 - 363.66] people would take large dosages of it so
[362.04 - 366.78] when you go to an ayahuasca ceremony
[363.66 - 368.94] right you would drink a bowl of it
[366.78 - 370.86] you would you would Blitz and blast out
[368.94 - 372.36] your mind so bad you wouldn't even know
[370.86 - 375.12] who you were you'd be screaming and
[372.36 - 377.76] rolling around in the dirt vomiting
[375.12 - 380.40] pulling scratching your eyes out
[377.76 - 383.46] I've had people come to me years ago
[380.40 - 386.22] that scratched their own eyeballs out
[383.46 - 389.04] during an ayahuasca ceremony would I
[386.22 - 391.74] mean scratched they were blind forever
[389.04 - 393.78] they dug their eyeballs out
[391.74 - 395.94] with their hands
[393.78 - 398.28] so what happened was too much of that
[395.94 - 399.96] happened too many people got injured too
[398.28 - 402.36] many people got hurt too many people got
[399.96 - 404.28] brain damaged so they started to lower
[402.36 - 405.84] the dosage with something no one thought
[404.28 - 408.54] of
[405.84 - 410.58] after all those years it was realized
[408.54 - 413.34] maybe it should be a smaller amount
[410.58 - 415.62] maybe it should be a tiny amount
[413.34 - 418.44] and so micro dosing took on a whole new
[415.62 - 420.18] world where it's micro dosing only do a
[418.44 - 422.94] little bit of a toxic poisonous mushroom
[420.18 - 425.96] only do a little bit of
[422.94 - 429.12] Ayahuasca only do a little bit
[425.96 - 431.46] Lolita's uh zat says I was Heavy in
[429.12 - 433.86] Ayahuasca for many years and it would
[431.46 - 435.30] it would end up destroying me for a long
[433.86 - 439.62] period of time
[435.30 - 441.96] oh sorry and it wound up destroying me
[439.62 - 443.64] for a long period of time Elite I
[441.96 - 444.96] totally understand so I'm just
[443.64 - 446.34] explaining a little bit about the micro
[444.96 - 449.54] dosing
[446.34 - 449.54] and how that works
[449.70 - 452.90] I mean honestly
[453.12 - 456.48] and you know what's cool telling you
[454.92 - 459.24] guys because I don't think a lot of you
[456.48 - 461.76] guys get mad about this stuff but before
[459.24 - 463.74] before I was like censored and stuff
[461.76 - 465.30] right Shadow band and everything else
[463.74 - 468.84] and
[465.30 - 471.54] open to a large large Arena of people
[468.84 - 474.84] seeing it man people would go berserk
[471.54 - 476.88] right they go berserk it's incredible
[474.84 - 480.60] how things work you talk about
[476.88 - 483.56] Ayahuasca people get angry you know and
[480.60 - 483.56] they still do out there
[484.02 - 486.96] um let's go
[485.10 - 488.76] so really the term plant medicine should
[486.96 - 491.46] be all about fruits leafy greens herbs
[488.76 - 493.14] wild foods and vegetables that are not
[491.46 - 495.24] mind-altering or adrenaline surging
[493.14 - 497.40] sources the plant chemical compounds
[495.24 - 500.18] plant medicine should be about
[497.40 - 500.18] blackberries
[500.28 - 503.28] which is an incredible form of plant
[502.44 - 504.96] medicine
[503.28 - 507.96] plant medicine should be about wild
[504.96 - 510.30] blueberries wild blueberries
[507.96 - 514.08] blackberries are almost wild cultivated
[510.30 - 516.66] blackberries are almost wild they're so
[514.08 - 518.88] strong they're the alternative if you
[516.66 - 520.56] can't do like the wild blueberry or
[518.88 - 522.78] something like that right I talk about
[520.56 - 525.72] the alternative the Blackberry is is
[522.78 - 528.06] it's not it's not a wild blueberry but
[525.72 - 530.04] it offers still partial partial
[528.06 - 532.74] phytochemical compounds and partial
[530.04 - 535.28] anthocyanins that are almost in that
[532.74 - 535.28] wild state
[535.86 - 541.02] plant medicine should be about
[537.42 - 542.88] blackberries wild blueberries lemon balm
[541.02 - 545.16] that's plant medicine
[542.88 - 549.66] lemon balm
[545.16 - 551.58] Rosemary Ginger thyme right it's a lemon
[549.66 - 553.32] balm right there
[551.58 - 557.52] Rosemary
[553.32 - 560.60] Ginger thyme celery
[557.52 - 560.60] celery is plant medicine
[560.94 - 564.42] spinach
[562.62 - 565.80] that's an incredible run that's
[564.42 - 568.08] incredible
[565.80 - 570.24] leafy green
[568.08 - 571.38] an incredible
[570.24 - 575.46] one
[571.38 - 579.20] cilantro can't say enough about cilantro
[575.46 - 579.20] and shiitake mushrooms
[580.32 - 584.48] those are just a few examples instead
[582.48 - 588.36] plant medicine is being used to give
[584.48 - 592.14] benediction psilocybin mushrooms also
[588.36 - 593.28] known as magic mushrooms or shrooms
[592.14 - 594.54] ayahuasca
[593.28 - 596.40] even
[594.54 - 599.22] cacao
[596.40 - 600.96] like cacao ceremonies intense cacao
[599.22 - 604.20] consumers right
[600.96 - 605.88] matcha tea and other green tea
[604.20 - 608.70] let's go into the next section playing
[605.88 - 610.50] with poisons this is really cool the
[608.70 - 612.00] problem we have with both alternative
[610.50 - 614.52] and conventional medicine we have a
[612.00 - 616.26] problem with alternative medicine what
[614.52 - 619.44] there's no problem with alternative
[616.26 - 620.82] medicine Alternatives it's perfect
[619.44 - 622.86] there's a problem with conventional
[620.82 - 624.54] medicine
[622.86 - 627.06] the problem we have with both
[624.54 - 629.04] alternative and conventional medicine is
[627.06 - 632.16] the same problem we have with Discerning
[629.04 - 635.64] what plant medicine really is
[632.16 - 637.86] no one knows why anyone lives with
[635.64 - 641.82] chronic symptoms and conditions it's
[637.86 - 643.62] obvious it's evident it's factual
[641.82 - 645.84] spiritual path to true love says is
[643.62 - 647.82] microdosing like Homeopathy nope it's
[645.84 - 650.24] not Homeopathy it's not like Homeopathy
[647.82 - 650.24] good question
[650.40 - 654.24] this is an important part I'm reading
[652.14 - 656.10] right here so check this out very
[654.24 - 658.38] important part
[656.10 - 662.12] no one knows why anyone lives with
[658.38 - 662.12] chronic symptoms and conditions fact
[662.28 - 666.48] fact
[664.32 - 667.80] alternative medicines guessing games we
[666.48 - 669.00] know that it's been guessing games for
[667.80 - 670.62] decades
[669.00 - 673.02] conventional medicine which cause
[670.62 - 675.78] unknown with everything
[673.02 - 678.00] marjor herb I know one guy who did it
[675.78 - 680.40] and he was not even able to go home
[678.00 - 684.32] family picked him up from the United
[680.40 - 684.32] States and took him home to Europe
[684.84 - 690.84] I know many people who have done it
[688.32 - 694.74] Carnage is unbelievable
[690.84 - 697.44] Spoils of War are unbelievable with it
[694.74 - 699.78] it's really a sad thing all right
[697.44 - 702.12] no one knows why someone has anxiety
[699.78 - 703.68] depression bipolar I'm sorry but nobody
[702.12 - 705.00] knows
[703.68 - 706.62] I mean if you have the medical medium
[705.00 - 708.36] books and you learn the truth about why
[706.62 - 711.66] somebody has these things it's awesome
[708.36 - 713.82] but Lana says Erica yes very scary I
[711.66 - 715.86] didn't know about Anthony back then but
[713.82 - 720.20] I know I learned what was exactly
[715.86 - 720.20] happening to me it was damaging my brain
[722.10 - 726.84] no one knows why someone has anxiety
[723.90 - 729.80] depression bipolar disorder or OCD no
[726.84 - 732.54] one knows why anyone has brain fog
[729.80 - 734.64] fatigue or the Myriad of neurological
[732.54 - 736.68] symptoms that we explore throughout this
[734.64 - 739.20] book and the other books
[736.68 - 742.02] medical media books medical communities
[739.20 - 743.64] May categorize a given struggle as
[742.02 - 746.40] autoimmune
[743.64 - 748.58] that's not the same answer that's not
[746.40 - 751.74] the answer
[748.58 - 753.90] autoimmune still means we don't know why
[751.74 - 755.40] anybody has any of these symptoms
[753.90 - 757.58] conditions or health struggles so
[755.40 - 759.60] autoimmune is not the answer
[757.58 - 764.16] autoimmune means
[759.60 - 768.48] your body created an auto antibody
[764.16 - 770.54] to go and destroy your organs
[768.48 - 773.52] without your permission
[770.54 - 775.44] autoimmune is not why people are sick
[773.52 - 776.34] I talk about this in the medical medium
[775.44 - 778.86] books
[776.34 - 783.20] pathogens are what's getting into
[778.86 - 783.20] people's organs and injuring organs
[788.40 - 793.68] it all falls into the same pot of
[790.68 - 796.38] guessing game soup
[793.68 - 798.66] the conventional doctor doesn't know why
[796.38 - 803.18] you have depression
[798.66 - 803.18] yet offers an antidepressant
[804.84 - 809.64] the alternative doctor doesn't know why
[807.60 - 812.64] you have depression
[809.64 - 815.58] yet offers you a better diet
[812.64 - 817.50] a regular exercise routine
[815.58 - 820.02] the recommendation to get rid of
[817.50 - 822.84] processed foods and the instruction to
[820.02 - 825.44] take some vitamin D a multivitamin and
[822.84 - 825.44] some fish oil
[825.84 - 829.56] while not every doctor's visit will
[827.88 - 832.32] yield these exact recommendations
[829.56 - 835.02] whatever the varying recommendations are
[832.32 - 840.86] they still won't be based on knowing the
[835.02 - 840.86] true underlying why of your suffering
[842.16 - 846.78] perhaps the doctor believes gut health
[844.14 - 849.96] is causing your depression that candida
[846.78 - 851.22] are sibo or leaky gut or microbiome is
[849.96 - 853.74] to blame
[851.22 - 856.98] ring a bell anybody perhaps the doctor
[853.74 - 858.90] believes you have a chemical imbalance a
[856.98 - 861.30] neurotransmitter issue such as a
[858.90 - 865.02] dopamine deficiency whatever the case
[861.30 - 866.90] it's still a case of we don't know why
[865.02 - 870.42] you're sick
[866.90 - 873.14] we don't know why you have depression or
[870.42 - 873.14] chronic symptoms
[874.26 - 879.36] Spirit of compassion just blows my mind
[877.32 - 882.08] who talks about that who even who even
[879.36 - 882.08] talks about this
[882.36 - 886.80] no one
[884.34 - 889.74] the same guessing game technique has led
[886.80 - 891.48] to a widespread interest in psychedelics
[889.74 - 895.52] and microdosing
[891.48 - 895.52] Nobody Knows Why anybody's sick
[895.98 - 900.60] getting the connection now
[898.62 - 901.86] alternative medicine doesn't know why
[900.60 - 903.60] anybody's sick
[901.86 - 905.10] conventional medicine doesn't know any
[903.60 - 907.68] why anybody's sick they both play
[905.10 - 909.42] guessing games conventional might say
[907.68 - 912.18] try this antidepressant try this
[909.42 - 913.62] anti-anxiety Med try this antiocd med
[912.18 - 916.92] try this antidepressant again
[913.62 - 919.44] conventional alternative medicine
[916.92 - 921.96] might say hop on the table get a few
[919.44 - 924.24] needles thrown in your back
[921.96 - 927.66] go off to the you know go off to the gut
[924.24 - 931.38] doctor take a microbiome thing
[927.66 - 933.48] head to the uh you know naturopath get a
[931.38 - 937.14] new diet go to the functional medicine
[933.48 - 940.14] doctor and get a test
[937.14 - 942.42] a blood test but in the end
[940.14 - 944.40] we're in this position where people with
[942.42 - 945.42] severe depression still won't get an
[944.40 - 948.00] answer
[945.42 - 952.04] or other conditions still won't get an
[948.00 - 952.04] answer so what that leads
[952.44 - 956.46] it's a case of we don't know why you're
[954.84 - 958.92] sick we don't know why you have
[956.46 - 961.44] depression or any chronic symptom so the
[958.92 - 963.96] same guessing game you guys the same
[961.44 - 966.66] guessing game technique has led to
[963.96 - 968.10] widespread interest in psychedelics and
[966.66 - 970.34] microdosing
[968.10 - 974.34] conventional medicine is talking about
[970.34 - 977.28] using psychedelics now
[974.34 - 981.42] conventional medicine is so lost with
[977.28 - 984.78] why people have problems mentally
[981.42 - 987.72] that they're trying to tap into the
[984.78 - 989.36] Psychedelic movement
[987.72 - 992.70] conventional medicine wants to
[989.36 - 994.80] encapsulate and create and synthesize
[992.70 - 998.90] psychedelics
[994.80 - 998.90] and offer it for mental health
[1001.52 - 1006.08] someone searched for anything to try any
[1003.92 - 1009.02] answers leads them to the door of the
[1006.08 - 1011.00] darker side of plant medicine it's the
[1009.02 - 1013.30] darker side it's kind of like the dark
[1011.00 - 1013.30] web
[1014.42 - 1017.66] you have no answers you've been there
[1016.28 - 1019.22] you've done that you tried alternative
[1017.66 - 1021.14] medicine you tried conventional medicine
[1019.22 - 1023.60] you feel like you're losing your mind
[1021.14 - 1026.72] you feel like you're sick and you
[1023.60 - 1030.64] stumble across micro dosing the darker
[1026.72 - 1030.64] side of medicine plant medicine
[1030.68 - 1035.60] I said for years that just because
[1033.14 - 1037.72] something falls under the umbrella of
[1035.60 - 1042.52] ancient
[1037.72 - 1042.52] doesn't mean it's safe or perfect
[1046.40 - 1050.08] in the ancient days
[1050.24 - 1053.48] people would sacrifice people all the
[1052.40 - 1056.66] time
[1053.48 - 1058.40] a thousand people would go up
[1056.66 - 1061.04] on a cliff
[1058.40 - 1064.96] someone would come
[1061.04 - 1064.96] half a thousand people strapped in
[1065.00 - 1070.52] to a big wooden log a pole and they
[1069.02 - 1071.66] would literally cut open everybody's
[1070.52 - 1074.36] hearts and they would take out the
[1071.66 - 1078.34] hearts of a thousand people
[1074.36 - 1078.34] and throw the heart into a pit of fire
[1079.22 - 1083.66] we're on page 152 we're in brain saver
[1081.56 - 1086.12] reading about microdosing
[1083.66 - 1087.74] it was ancient does that mean it was
[1086.12 - 1089.96] good
[1087.74 - 1092.48] does that mean it was great
[1089.96 - 1093.92] sacrificing humans sacred ripping their
[1092.48 - 1095.90] hearts out of their bodies cutting their
[1093.92 - 1099.62] chest open the rib cage just explode
[1095.90 - 1102.44] open because if you cut perfectly right
[1099.62 - 1104.60] just the right fashion the rib cage just
[1102.44 - 1107.30] pops
[1104.60 - 1109.40] and it opens up the door like and that's
[1107.30 - 1112.22] what they used to do for sacrifice it
[1109.40 - 1114.38] they did that all over this planet two
[1112.22 - 1117.16] thousand years ago three thousand four
[1114.38 - 1117.16] thousand years ago
[1117.20 - 1121.40] even later than that
[1119.60 - 1123.14] your chest pops open your heart's
[1121.40 - 1125.24] beating while you're still alive and
[1123.14 - 1127.40] then they cut your heart out throw it in
[1125.24 - 1130.58] a pit of fire it was an ancient practice
[1127.40 - 1132.56] was it a good thing it was ancient so it
[1130.58 - 1134.18] must have been good anything ancient is
[1132.56 - 1136.04] great nothing wrong with anything
[1134.18 - 1138.02] ancient at all
[1136.04 - 1139.88] once it's under the umbrella of ancient
[1138.02 - 1142.40] or ancient medicine or ancient whatever
[1139.88 - 1144.50] it's great what about all the Mercury
[1142.40 - 1146.12] elixirs that were given to people what
[1144.50 - 1148.58] about Quicksilver
[1146.12 - 1150.44] all through Europe in the 1700s in the
[1148.58 - 1152.60] 1800s they offered Quicksilver everybody
[1150.44 - 1155.24] was drinking Mercury where did they get
[1152.60 - 1158.30] that advice they got it from Chinese
[1155.24 - 1159.98] medicine Emperors would drink would they
[1158.30 - 1162.20] would drink Quicksilver it was just
[1159.98 - 1164.00] Mercury elixirs right that was an
[1162.20 - 1166.64] ancient practice
[1164.00 - 1170.66] that led into Europe using Quicksilver
[1166.64 - 1172.04] so Quicksilver was was the medicine for
[1170.66 - 1173.30] anybody who was sick didn't matter if
[1172.04 - 1175.28] you were a baby didn't matter if you
[1173.30 - 1177.44] were an adult didn't matter who you were
[1175.28 - 1179.54] you go to the doctor and you drink a
[1177.44 - 1180.86] whole glass of straight Mercury you lose
[1179.54 - 1182.66] your mind
[1180.86 - 1184.88] and you don't even know who you are you
[1182.66 - 1186.56] leave and you're tremoring and shaking
[1184.88 - 1188.54] and your brains and your eyeballs almost
[1186.56 - 1190.58] pop out of your head
[1188.54 - 1192.88] that was the practice
[1190.58 - 1197.62] but since it was ancient
[1192.88 - 1197.62] must be perfect must be amazing
[1204.38 - 1208.46] over the years I've heard this hundreds
[1206.42 - 1210.74] of times the family reaching out to me
[1208.46 - 1212.78] because their daughter or son was at an
[1210.74 - 1215.42] Ayahuasca or other psychedelic ceremony
[1212.78 - 1217.94] and barely made it out alive and it was
[1215.42 - 1221.12] still to this day and still to this day
[1217.94 - 1223.34] they're suffering from brain injuries
[1221.12 - 1226.40] an IG
[1223.34 - 1228.56] eni says I've watched my friend using
[1226.40 - 1231.08] Ayahuasca slowly lose his mind every
[1228.56 - 1232.58] time he did it then he started licking
[1231.08 - 1234.92] frogs
[1232.58 - 1237.56] that's another uh thing too by the way
[1234.92 - 1240.26] is the Frog poison I forgot to talk
[1237.56 - 1241.88] about that I've got him on the heavy
[1240.26 - 1242.96] metal detox and it's really making a
[1241.88 - 1244.16] difference because it's bringing his
[1242.96 - 1247.82] brain back
[1244.16 - 1249.80] frog poison is another thing another
[1247.82 - 1252.46] micro dose
[1249.80 - 1252.46] practice
[1252.80 - 1258.46] that's such a neurotoxin a frog poison
[1255.38 - 1258.46] it's the craziest thing
[1258.50 - 1266.66] Amber says my dad took a lot of L LSD
[1262.88 - 1270.70] in the 60s and he is the most depressing
[1266.66 - 1270.70] person I'm sorry to hear that
[1272.06 - 1276.68] there's of Ayahuasca or other
[1274.04 - 1281.38] psychedelics will say the practitioner
[1276.68 - 1281.38] leading the ceremony was the problem
[1283.78 - 1292.04] whoa but don't worry my ayahuasca
[1288.92 - 1293.60] um practitioner my Ayahuasca Shaman I'm
[1292.04 - 1295.10] not it's not about shamans being bad or
[1293.60 - 1299.06] good or practitioners being bad or good
[1295.10 - 1302.06] it's whatever my Ayahuasca Guru
[1299.06 - 1303.92] does it way better my Ayahuasca gurus in
[1302.06 - 1306.80] LA
[1303.92 - 1309.68] and does it for like all the cool people
[1306.80 - 1311.96] he's the best
[1309.68 - 1316.58] it's you know yeah you had a bad trip
[1311.96 - 1318.32] you had a bad Ayahuasca dude
[1316.58 - 1320.54] but you know what I hang around with the
[1318.32 - 1321.56] cool people in LA
[1320.54 - 1323.66] all right
[1321.56 - 1327.56] I know all the who's who
[1323.66 - 1330.14] so I got the cool shamans and the cool
[1327.56 - 1331.40] Ayahuasca gurus and we don't really get
[1330.14 - 1334.22] hurt
[1331.40 - 1336.44] yeah I've heard that effortless Endeavor
[1334.22 - 1339.08] says have you seen the leading experts
[1336.44 - 1341.60] in Psychology are now totally promoting
[1339.08 - 1343.22] psychedelics I am I talked about that a
[1341.60 - 1345.50] minute ago where
[1343.22 - 1347.98] conventional wisdom is heading there too
[1345.50 - 1347.98] I know
[1348.14 - 1352.82] yeah because they're desperate people
[1350.00 - 1355.52] are sick and when you're sick and you
[1352.82 - 1357.92] can't find anything that works you can't
[1355.52 - 1360.08] find the right
[1357.92 - 1361.40] protocol to help people with all these
[1360.08 - 1364.30] different conditions
[1361.40 - 1367.88] you don't know the answers
[1364.30 - 1371.18] you don't have the answers
[1367.88 - 1372.98] protocols see protocols you don't have
[1371.18 - 1374.78] the answers
[1372.98 - 1377.48] and when you don't have the answers out
[1374.78 - 1379.64] there yeah even conventional medicine is
[1377.48 - 1380.54] in the top psychology you know experts
[1379.64 - 1382.36] are going to be playing around with
[1380.54 - 1385.70] psychedelics of course they're desperate
[1382.36 - 1387.68] desperate to get somebody something
[1385.70 - 1390.94] but they're just gonna
[1387.68 - 1390.94] they're just gonna have them up
[1393.58 - 1399.38] jumping on Trends is what they're doing
[1395.90 - 1402.20] they all do this science says it's great
[1399.38 - 1404.90] but down the road once billions are
[1402.20 - 1406.52] damaged and mangled
[1404.90 - 1410.06] science will say it's not good anymore
[1406.52 - 1413.02] but science never pays any prices
[1410.06 - 1413.02] just the people
[1418.52 - 1421.58] foreign
[1419.60 - 1423.38] Defenders of Ayahuasca or other
[1421.58 - 1425.72] psychedelics will say the practitioner
[1423.38 - 1427.34] leading the ceremony was the problem and
[1425.72 - 1429.92] that you have to be careful who you
[1427.34 - 1432.02] choose to guide you
[1429.92 - 1434.30] I've heard that one a lot in the
[1432.02 - 1436.22] Psychedelic realm you didn't have the
[1434.30 - 1438.80] right guy guide you with the Frog poison
[1436.22 - 1442.16] but now you can't speak or talk because
[1438.80 - 1445.18] it totally screwed up
[1442.16 - 1445.18] your brain stem
[1446.06 - 1450.56] this is not to disrespect anyone
[1448.04 - 1452.48] involved in Ayahuasca ceremonies or any
[1450.56 - 1454.58] kind of indigenous technique of
[1452.48 - 1456.14] spiritual healing
[1454.58 - 1457.94] foreign
[1456.14 - 1459.98] because that's what also somebody will
[1457.94 - 1461.96] someone will say to be like oh you're
[1459.98 - 1462.98] just what are you harping on indigenous
[1461.96 - 1465.26] people
[1462.98 - 1466.76] because Ayahuasca was originally a whole
[1465.26 - 1469.78] indigenous thing is that what you're
[1466.76 - 1469.78] doing medical media
[1471.50 - 1477.20] so this is not to just disrespect any
[1474.32 - 1479.12] involved in Ayahuasca ceremonies or any
[1477.20 - 1482.66] kind of indigenous technique of
[1479.12 - 1486.52] spiritual healing indigenous cultures
[1482.66 - 1486.52] have also grown bananas
[1488.56 - 1493.58] it's interesting right
[1490.94 - 1496.66] indigenous cultures have grown bananas
[1493.58 - 1499.04] that's a plant medicine
[1496.66 - 1502.30] indigenous cultures have also grown
[1499.04 - 1506.44] spices such as vanilla bean cinnamon
[1502.30 - 1506.44] turmeric and ginger
[1506.48 - 1512.00] there are non-toxic these are non-toxic
[1509.84 - 1513.98] and have healing properties plant
[1512.00 - 1516.56] medicine
[1513.98 - 1519.38] while some of these can be self-limiting
[1516.56 - 1521.92] meaning that large quantities can be
[1519.38 - 1521.92] irritating
[1521.96 - 1529.52] like spice they are not dangerous
[1526.70 - 1532.28] our brain does not see them as an enemy
[1529.52 - 1535.46] nor does our immune system or body or
[1532.28 - 1538.94] adrenals at the same time whether we're
[1535.46 - 1542.24] an indigenous culture or not we can all
[1538.94 - 1545.30] grow eat and play around with poisons
[1542.24 - 1547.16] many non-indigenous people become guides
[1545.30 - 1549.14] or practitioners who administer
[1547.16 - 1550.40] psychedelics
[1549.14 - 1551.90] it's really important to know this
[1550.40 - 1553.22] information rising out of the ashes says
[1551.90 - 1555.92] oh my God I had a friend
[1553.22 - 1559.16] that did that don't have contact with
[1555.92 - 1564.04] her because she lost it reality and she
[1559.16 - 1564.04] got so spaced and so paranoid so sad
[1566.90 - 1571.10] what I mean to address here is the
[1569.36 - 1573.32] person who's looking for answers to
[1571.10 - 1575.18] chronic illness the person who's
[1573.32 - 1578.12] desperate to try anything and gets
[1575.18 - 1580.82] further injured in that process Landing
[1578.12 - 1583.10] a life of much more suffering and
[1580.82 - 1584.78] hardship than they already had with
[1583.10 - 1588.32] their condition
[1584.78 - 1590.72] people in their lives may pass it off as
[1588.32 - 1592.58] a bad trip sweep it under the carpet
[1590.72 - 1594.50] first of all I gotta say something be
[1592.58 - 1596.78] really clear here I'm not just talking
[1594.50 - 1598.82] about somebody who does
[1596.78 - 1601.10] a whole bunch of acid has a really bad
[1598.82 - 1603.08] trip and everybody's saying I'm not I
[1601.10 - 1605.54] don't do drugs I don't do drugs I micro
[1603.08 - 1608.60] dose with like a careful with a careful
[1605.54 - 1610.52] guide and and that's not doing drugs
[1608.60 - 1613.04] people have to understand that like this
[1610.52 - 1615.14] is this is
[1613.04 - 1618.70] a really important
[1615.14 - 1618.70] part of it all
[1618.80 - 1624.04] because someone's going to say that's
[1620.24 - 1624.04] not me that's somebody that
[1624.08 - 1629.00] is doing some heavy drugs
[1626.72 - 1630.98] and they lost their mind because of a
[1629.00 - 1632.66] bad trip
[1630.98 - 1636.14] but that's not what I'm talking about
[1632.66 - 1638.66] here I'm talking about every day people
[1636.14 - 1641.72] who aren't doing drugs they don't
[1638.66 - 1644.00] they're not about doing drugs they're
[1641.72 - 1646.64] looking for answers and they get pulled
[1644.00 - 1648.92] into this whole spiritual aspect of wait
[1646.64 - 1650.12] a minute the answers are in the
[1648.92 - 1652.10] spiritual experience you're going to
[1650.12 - 1654.38] have when you do some micro dosing it's
[1652.10 - 1656.18] safe it's a small amount it's not like
[1654.38 - 1657.86] it used to be you're not going to be
[1656.18 - 1659.96] tripping like you're on acid and people
[1657.86 - 1661.82] are LED into this but that's what I'm
[1659.96 - 1663.32] talking about people in their lives may
[1661.82 - 1664.94] pass it off as a bad trip because
[1663.32 - 1667.34] they'll have a bad trip from that too
[1664.94 - 1669.14] sweep it under the carpet and call it
[1667.34 - 1672.62] their Journey
[1669.14 - 1674.78] saying it was supposed to happen
[1672.62 - 1677.38] here's something really sad to know
[1674.78 - 1677.38] right now
[1677.84 - 1683.42] is that when someone does get injured
[1681.56 - 1685.76] in a retreat
[1683.42 - 1688.78] after doing ayahuasca
[1685.76 - 1688.78] everybody else
[1689.30 - 1693.62] tells them
[1691.52 - 1695.96] it was supposed to happen it's part of
[1693.62 - 1699.08] your journey
[1695.96 - 1702.02] the person's like going home
[1699.08 - 1703.40] with an injured brain paranoia severe
[1702.02 - 1706.00] OCD
[1703.40 - 1708.38] severe delusion
[1706.00 - 1712.10] adrenals completely fried
[1708.38 - 1714.56] brain fog crazy brain fog they're going
[1712.10 - 1715.82] home like wait a minute I thought this
[1714.56 - 1717.44] experience was supposed to be good I
[1715.82 - 1718.94] thought this was supposed to be good I
[1717.44 - 1720.44] thought this was supposed to be good and
[1718.94 - 1722.18] then everybody at the retreat's like oh
[1720.44 - 1723.62] that was supposed to happen that was
[1722.18 - 1726.38] your journey that was your spiritual
[1723.62 - 1729.62] journey you're going to learn from it
[1726.38 - 1731.54] you're going to grow from it
[1729.62 - 1734.62] how do I know this that's what I've seen
[1731.54 - 1734.62] happen so many times
[1735.50 - 1739.94] and that they had to learn something
[1737.18 - 1741.50] meanwhile it was an injury and not a
[1739.94 - 1743.12] positive experience of any kind for
[1741.50 - 1746.72] anyone
[1743.12 - 1748.34] it was just a flat out injury
[1746.72 - 1751.28] it wasn't
[1748.34 - 1753.92] a positive experience and now it's about
[1751.28 - 1757.22] how do we recover from that
[1753.92 - 1759.26] maybe what maybe no one even realizes
[1757.22 - 1761.24] that their brain health is declining
[1759.26 - 1763.40] from injury
[1761.24 - 1766.70] whether a decline that continues over
[1763.40 - 1769.94] time after one trip or a steady decline
[1766.70 - 1771.38] with each psychedelic experience another
[1769.94 - 1773.18] problem that happens if you're not
[1771.38 - 1775.52] taking care of your brain
[1773.18 - 1777.38] it can decline over time from this stuff
[1775.52 - 1780.08] I told you guys have to fasten your seat
[1777.38 - 1781.88] belts for this ride
[1780.08 - 1783.92] micro dosing new marketing for
[1781.88 - 1786.32] psychedelics
[1783.92 - 1787.88] I'm in the next section I'm on page 153
[1786.32 - 1790.46] of brain saver this is really good
[1787.88 - 1792.20] information for day 20 of the brain shot
[1790.46 - 1793.94] therapy cleanse challenge this is the
[1792.20 - 1795.38] last day of the 20-day challenge an
[1793.94 - 1797.06] incredible day finding your purpose
[1795.38 - 1798.98] stabilizer why are we talking about
[1797.06 - 1800.12] micro dosing we're talking about finding
[1798.98 - 1804.44] our purpose because that's another
[1800.12 - 1806.30] reason why so many people lead to micro
[1804.44 - 1808.10] dosing because they're trying to find
[1806.30 - 1810.20] their purpose they feel sad they feel
[1808.10 - 1812.06] lost they feel insecure about everything
[1810.20 - 1815.06] in their life and they go to try to find
[1812.06 - 1817.48] their purpose through psychedelics
[1815.06 - 1819.44] maybe you know somebody
[1817.48 - 1821.00] microdosing the new marketing for
[1819.44 - 1823.82] psychedelics the landscape around
[1821.00 - 1826.82] psychedelics has changed in recent years
[1823.82 - 1829.58] the mistakes of the past consuming High
[1826.82 - 1831.74] dosages of psychedelics are less common
[1829.58 - 1833.72] like I was saying earlier they don't do
[1831.74 - 1836.24] big bowls of Ayahuasca and everybody
[1833.72 - 1838.16] takes a huge sip of it they do small
[1836.24 - 1839.72] amounts they even put it inside little
[1838.16 - 1841.90] candies and other stuff you know the
[1839.72 - 1841.90] game
[1844.40 - 1850.94] too many obvious injuries have occurred
[1847.00 - 1852.98] and how now there's the term microdosing
[1850.94 - 1855.86] to clean up the mess
[1852.98 - 1859.36] the term microdosing was created to
[1855.86 - 1859.36] clean up the mess
[1860.84 - 1865.76] it's unbelievable
[1863.06 - 1867.68] we talk it up as though if we micro dose
[1865.76 - 1870.20] we give ourselves permission to partake
[1867.68 - 1872.24] don't worry it's only micro dosing it's
[1870.20 - 1875.18] okay everybody's doing it
[1872.24 - 1877.22] it's like a new level of stupidity
[1875.18 - 1879.50] happening
[1877.22 - 1881.48] let's see Chef Tien it says I was
[1879.50 - 1883.94] injured and told it was part of the
[1881.48 - 1886.40] journey also told the dose was too much
[1883.94 - 1887.96] such BS
[1886.40 - 1890.50] thank you for leaving your comment that
[1887.96 - 1890.50] was on IG
[1891.02 - 1895.34] we give ourselves permission to partake
[1893.12 - 1898.52] as if it's now a controlled environment
[1895.34 - 1900.86] because micro dosing is controlled
[1898.52 - 1901.94] that's how we're supposed to be led to
[1900.86 - 1904.34] feel
[1901.94 - 1907.16] oh it's micro dosing I can handle that
[1904.34 - 1908.42] it's control and since everybody wants
[1907.16 - 1910.46] control over themselves it's like no
[1908.42 - 1912.98] that's controlled so
[1910.46 - 1915.88] sounds like a small amount it it's
[1912.98 - 1915.88] probably going to be fine
[1916.52 - 1921.68] term microdosing makes us feel safe
[1919.70 - 1924.02] it makes us feel safe
[1921.68 - 1925.34] it's like ah don't worry it's only micro
[1924.02 - 1927.80] dosing
[1925.34 - 1929.30] so the human psyche microdosing also
[1927.80 - 1931.22] implies that there's some scientific
[1929.30 - 1933.70] nature involved like someone figured
[1931.22 - 1933.70] something out
[1933.92 - 1939.68] so it's like oh my
[1937.16 - 1941.84] ayahuasca
[1939.68 - 1944.84] practitioner Guru
[1941.84 - 1947.36] Shaman my Ayahuasca guy says it's micro
[1944.84 - 1949.22] dosing so he has it all done so there's
[1947.36 - 1951.20] a science behind it there must be this
[1949.22 - 1953.12] great science behind it when it's not
[1951.20 - 1954.56] there's nothing behind it it's just a
[1953.12 - 1956.60] smaller dosage it's someone's kind of
[1954.56 - 1959.00] like shimmying up
[1956.60 - 1961.28] accounts bookkeeper says on YouTube this
[1959.00 - 1964.28] is true both my brothers who passed away
[1961.28 - 1966.92] from these substances were blamed by the
[1964.28 - 1969.38] community of substance user they were in
[1966.92 - 1971.72] as being flawed or being too sensitive
[1969.38 - 1973.16] or too too susceptible
[1971.72 - 1976.04] my God
[1973.16 - 1977.60] this still my heart pours out to you
[1976.04 - 1980.60] it really does
[1977.60 - 1982.72] it starts getting me upset because you
[1980.60 - 1982.72] know
[1984.14 - 1987.50] yeah
[1985.40 - 1989.78] I could read into it pretty deep and
[1987.50 - 1991.78] it's it's rough
[1989.78 - 1991.78] um
[1993.26 - 1997.58] check this out to the human psyche micro
[1995.66 - 1999.26] dosing also implies that there's a
[1997.58 - 2000.46] scientific nature involved but there's
[1999.26 - 2002.92] none
[2000.46 - 2005.50] we feel secure in the sense that there's
[2002.92 - 2007.66] some type of Science advising it well
[2005.50 - 2009.16] there must be like some scientific setup
[2007.66 - 2011.86] on that
[2009.16 - 2014.14] don't worry conventional medicine is
[2011.86 - 2015.22] taking psychedelics now and they're
[2014.14 - 2017.08] going to be making their own
[2015.22 - 2019.48] prescriptions and dosages and everything
[2017.08 - 2021.40] else and you can call it micro dosing or
[2019.48 - 2023.56] whatever you want to call it
[2021.40 - 2025.18] right don't put the science behind it
[2023.56 - 2027.36] they'll just make a smaller dose or
[2025.18 - 2027.36] something
[2030.04 - 2033.06] really interesting
[2034.48 - 2041.76] so here's a comment Laquita says it just
[2038.68 - 2045.22] seems like this is a little extreme
[2041.76 - 2047.98] it doesn't have to be a yes this is good
[2045.22 - 2050.50] or no this is bad there's so much Nuance
[2047.98 - 2052.60] to psychedelics I'm not sure how helpful
[2050.50 - 2054.94] this is
[2052.60 - 2056.38] well we're getting into pretty soon if
[2054.94 - 2058.48] you can stay on here
[2056.38 - 2060.10] we're getting into what psychedelics do
[2058.48 - 2063.70] to the brain which is actually really
[2060.10 - 2065.38] important but I don't know if you were
[2063.70 - 2067.78] here a couple of minutes ago when I was
[2065.38 - 2070.90] reading some of the comments
[2067.78 - 2073.48] some families were destroyed
[2070.90 - 2076.06] some people died
[2073.48 - 2078.22] life was lost and some people lost their
[2076.06 - 2081.52] minds just with the few comments I'm
[2078.22 - 2083.56] reading from people's experiences
[2081.52 - 2086.52] laughs
[2083.56 - 2086.52] and
[2087.10 - 2091.00] I'm all connected into the world of like
[2089.56 - 2093.94] who's who out there and doing different
[2091.00 - 2094.78] things and people are micro dosing out
[2093.94 - 2096.40] there
[2094.78 - 2098.86] that's just what they're doing and
[2096.40 - 2100.84] people are getting injured by it
[2098.86 - 2103.24] actually injured
[2100.84 - 2105.16] so what's the nuances
[2103.24 - 2108.34] some dude had a good
[2105.16 - 2110.32] had a good thing about it and
[2108.34 - 2112.18] or some person had a good thing that
[2110.32 - 2113.50] happened with it and just that's a
[2112.18 - 2116.70] Nuance don't worry about the other
[2113.50 - 2116.70] person who gets injured
[2118.12 - 2121.86] I don't know what those nuances are
[2122.62 - 2127.30] what about if somebody's scale wasn't
[2124.30 - 2129.16] tipped yet and they go and do it
[2127.30 - 2130.84] you follow those people later in life
[2129.16 - 2132.34] and guess what their problems are worse
[2130.84 - 2134.44] or you follow the people that are
[2132.34 - 2136.72] offering micro dosing and psychedelics
[2134.44 - 2138.94] you follow them later in their life see
[2136.72 - 2140.44] where their life is in 10 15 years ask
[2138.94 - 2141.64] them what they're doing now chances are
[2140.44 - 2143.80] they'll be like I don't do that anymore
[2141.64 - 2145.30] that stuff really screwed me up you just
[2143.80 - 2147.10] don't know you don't know what the
[2145.30 - 2149.02] future brings you don't know the people
[2147.10 - 2150.34] that are actually doing it how like 10
[2149.02 - 2152.26] years later they're like I can't even
[2150.34 - 2154.06] touch that stuff I did that stuff and I
[2152.26 - 2156.30] think it screwed me up but you won't
[2154.06 - 2156.30] know
[2156.70 - 2161.50] I I I appreciate your question but hang
[2159.52 - 2163.24] on because I want to talk about you know
[2161.50 - 2166.98] if you could stay here I want to talk
[2163.24 - 2166.98] about the rest of it about the brain
[2170.80 - 2174.82] we feel secure in the sense that there's
[2172.78 - 2176.68] some type of Science advising it that
[2174.82 - 2179.64] some types of study has occurred and
[2176.68 - 2179.64] proves efficacy
[2180.82 - 2184.00] as you've learned about scientific
[2182.74 - 2185.62] studies
[2184.00 - 2187.18] they're really just theories combined
[2185.62 - 2189.16] with never-ending games of trial and
[2187.18 - 2191.68] error done by people
[2189.16 - 2194.56] done by a person
[2191.68 - 2197.50] science are people
[2194.56 - 2199.18] science isn't this machine this massive
[2197.50 - 2201.70] machine
[2199.18 - 2203.32] where it's this big computer base up in
[2201.70 - 2205.72] the sky in the heavens and it knows
[2203.32 - 2209.38] everything and that's science so science
[2205.72 - 2212.56] can never be wrong it's this big giant
[2209.38 - 2214.66] orb that's floating up in the atmosphere
[2212.56 - 2216.64] that knows everything
[2214.66 - 2218.80] science is a bunch of people screwing
[2216.64 - 2220.96] around paid money to screw out in a lab
[2218.80 - 2224.16] hoping that human error doesn't blow at
[2220.96 - 2224.16] every second which it does
[2224.22 - 2231.00] Gabriella I lost three friends because
[2228.16 - 2234.22] of Ayahuasca I nearly died as well
[2231.00 - 2236.32] Gabriella I'm so sorry to hear that
[2234.22 - 2237.94] truly
[2236.32 - 2239.62] but apparently the other person that
[2237.94 - 2243.82] commented said well you can't really
[2239.62 - 2246.04] whatever I seem to nuances and
[2243.82 - 2250.50] I respect everybody commenting I'm just
[2246.04 - 2250.50] saying that it's it's it's just like
[2254.98 - 2258.76] as you learned about scientific studies
[2257.26 - 2260.50] they're just theories combined with
[2258.76 - 2263.22] never-ending guessing games trial and
[2260.50 - 2266.32] error from humans
[2263.22 - 2269.38] labeling drug
[2266.32 - 2271.60] use as micro dosing provides a sense of
[2269.38 - 2274.18] safety to a wider variety of people it
[2271.60 - 2276.64] opens up the gamma to a whole bunch of
[2274.18 - 2279.70] people who are sick and nobody knows why
[2276.64 - 2281.68] they're sick nobody has an answer to why
[2279.70 - 2284.02] they're sick their mental health is
[2281.68 - 2285.58] declining they're suffering they tried
[2284.02 - 2287.74] everything that they can find already
[2285.58 - 2289.66] nobody knows why they're suffering
[2287.74 - 2291.58] emotionally and mentally they're
[2289.66 - 2294.58] struggling out there
[2291.58 - 2297.40] and then psychedelics is the new answer
[2294.58 - 2300.10] microdosing is the new answer
[2297.40 - 2302.08] it's just another total just screw me
[2300.10 - 2305.10] over kind of deal and that's just the
[2302.08 - 2305.10] way it works it's sad
[2305.92 - 2310.78] now it's tempting to many more people
[2308.20 - 2312.40] who would never partake in this someone
[2310.78 - 2314.14] would never partake in any of this stuff
[2312.40 - 2315.46] but when you label it micro dosing and
[2314.14 - 2317.86] kind of put like a little bit of a
[2315.46 - 2319.66] science behind it it opens a door for a
[2317.86 - 2322.32] huge Floodgate of people to be like all
[2319.66 - 2322.32] right I'll try it
[2324.58 - 2328.36] Dr Nesbitt doesn't even do psychedelics
[2326.86 - 2330.88] but he's here today and he's actually
[2328.36 - 2332.20] going to be talking about microdosing
[2330.88 - 2334.42] and other things and the prescriptions
[2332.20 - 2336.72] he's he's taking that he prescribes
[2334.42 - 2336.72] himself
[2339.40 - 2345.52] on IG
[2341.62 - 2346.42] yemri says how come I connect it to my
[2345.52 - 2348.52] soul
[2346.42 - 2350.92] and felt unconditional love for the
[2348.52 - 2352.90] first time when I did Ayahuasca could it
[2350.92 - 2354.94] be that even though it's a toxin it
[2352.90 - 2356.74] connects you to a source we are coming
[2354.94 - 2359.02] to that in just a minute will you please
[2356.74 - 2362.86] hang on for that answer it's actually
[2359.02 - 2364.54] coming the answer is mind-blowing
[2362.86 - 2366.70] now it's tempting to many more people
[2364.54 - 2368.32] who would have never partaked and and
[2366.70 - 2371.26] didn't feel like they would partake
[2368.32 - 2372.70] unless they had some kind of Science and
[2371.26 - 2374.74] monitoring to it which makes you feel
[2372.70 - 2379.36] like micro dosing is science it's no
[2374.74 - 2382.00] longer just a niche crowd Meech crowd a
[2379.36 - 2384.58] people who go into the desert sit around
[2382.00 - 2386.14] a campfire and drink a whole bowl of
[2384.58 - 2388.42] psychedelics
[2386.14 - 2389.92] it's no longer that anymore that still
[2388.42 - 2391.12] exists that's still happening but it's
[2389.92 - 2394.24] not like that anymore it's this micro
[2391.12 - 2396.40] dosing thing marketing has now made it
[2394.24 - 2397.90] seem like science has been applied to
[2396.40 - 2399.04] psychedelics
[2397.90 - 2401.56] it hasn't
[2399.04 - 2403.98] a tactic that pulls in a much bigger
[2401.56 - 2403.98] crowd
[2408.76 - 2412.38] a hippie dude in his basement
[2412.96 - 2419.70] putting droppers of ayahuasca
[2416.50 - 2419.70] on M MS
[2419.86 - 2425.16] and calling it micro dosing
[2422.62 - 2428.44] there's no science to that
[2425.16 - 2431.02] the term microdosing acts as a safeguard
[2428.44 - 2433.54] it makes someone believe that the person
[2431.02 - 2435.52] and I like hippies I'm not happy I'm not
[2433.54 - 2438.00] anti-anybody
[2435.52 - 2438.00] whatever
[2439.30 - 2444.70] said a doctor the other day call me a
[2441.04 - 2446.38] hippie because I have a ponytail
[2444.70 - 2448.66] let's have a bun
[2446.38 - 2450.58] I was like what did you just call me
[2448.66 - 2452.14] so you go like the hippie do going on
[2450.58 - 2453.52] you're like a hippie I go yeah sure
[2452.14 - 2455.20] whatever
[2453.52 - 2457.36] fine
[2455.20 - 2459.52] it doesn't bother me it's great the term
[2457.36 - 2461.80] microdosing acts as a safeguard it makes
[2459.52 - 2464.08] someone believe that the person offering
[2461.80 - 2466.54] a therapy and using the term microdosing
[2464.08 - 2467.86] knows a lot it makes you think that they
[2466.54 - 2470.44] know a lot especially when you're
[2467.86 - 2472.48] younger you're younger and there's just
[2470.44 - 2473.86] an older dude who's the shaman or the
[2472.48 - 2475.36] guru that's playing around with the
[2473.86 - 2477.64] micro dosing the Frog poison and stuff
[2475.36 - 2479.20] and here you are you're 22 years old and
[2477.64 - 2481.12] you're just like whoa I'm here my
[2479.20 - 2483.58] brain's totally messed up I want answers
[2481.12 - 2485.14] I want a spiritual experience and it's
[2483.58 - 2487.48] like you got this dude he's 30 something
[2485.14 - 2489.16] years old he's an expert at micro dosing
[2487.48 - 2491.08] and he's putting exact amount of fraud
[2489.16 - 2493.36] poison on whatever and he's putting the
[2491.08 - 2496.38] exact then you're just like whoa yeah
[2493.36 - 2496.38] good luck
[2496.84 - 2500.62] breaks my heart it makes someone believe
[2499.00 - 2502.36] that the person offering a therapy and
[2500.62 - 2504.94] using the term microdosing knows a lot
[2502.36 - 2507.40] that they're very smart or well educated
[2504.94 - 2509.08] in the process they're offering well
[2507.40 - 2511.60] educated
[2509.08 - 2513.34] maybe that's true to some degree that
[2511.60 - 2516.58] the person offering a micro dosing
[2513.34 - 2519.28] technique knows a lot about the theory
[2516.58 - 2522.72] yet even if you know a lot about a game
[2519.28 - 2522.72] it's still a game
[2524.44 - 2529.20] there's still a wake of people injured
[2526.96 - 2533.20] from psychedelics people who went into
[2529.20 - 2535.42] microdosing therapy with migraines for
[2533.20 - 2537.40] example and ended up with migraines that
[2535.42 - 2539.44] were far worse coupled with additional
[2537.40 - 2542.38] symptoms
[2539.44 - 2544.36] I know people that went into
[2542.38 - 2546.16] microdosing
[2544.36 - 2548.08] safely
[2546.16 - 2550.60] so they called it
[2548.08 - 2553.42] and ended up and ended up
[2550.60 - 2555.64] with some worse migraines what
[2553.42 - 2557.26] psychedelics do is put the body in a
[2555.64 - 2560.28] crisis state
[2557.26 - 2560.28] get ready for this
[2561.16 - 2567.16] when we go through a crisis State and
[2563.56 - 2569.14] come out of it we change in some ways as
[2567.16 - 2570.94] a person
[2569.14 - 2573.94] critical
[2570.94 - 2577.24] critical to know this
[2573.94 - 2580.84] huge piece of information from above
[2577.24 - 2582.28] what psychedelics do is put the body in
[2580.84 - 2584.82] a crisis
[2582.28 - 2584.82] state
[2585.28 - 2592.00] wait to hear this when we go through a
[2588.70 - 2595.36] crisis State and come out of it we
[2592.00 - 2596.98] change in some ways as a person
[2595.36 - 2599.14] what I'm about to read to you that's
[2596.98 - 2600.76] coming up
[2599.14 - 2604.18] believable
[2600.76 - 2606.70] it's like surviving a 10 car pileup on
[2604.18 - 2610.18] the freeway
[2606.70 - 2612.52] your car flips over two or three times
[2610.18 - 2614.56] and you seem to walk out of it with a
[2612.52 - 2616.66] mild concussion while others around you
[2614.56 - 2618.82] died
[2616.66 - 2623.02] there's something that happens inside of
[2618.82 - 2626.74] us when we survive any kind of crisis
[2623.02 - 2629.32] and that falls into spiritual change
[2626.74 - 2632.32] and when we induce ourselves with the
[2629.32 - 2636.64] toxic chemical compound that throws our
[2632.32 - 2639.58] body into chaos I'll ask anybody frog
[2636.64 - 2643.48] poison psychedelic psilocybins
[2639.58 - 2645.78] after it subsides we feel we spiritually
[2643.48 - 2645.78] grow
[2647.32 - 2649.98] keep on going
[2651.16 - 2654.16] on IG
[2652.66 - 2656.56] Julie
[2654.16 - 2660.58] I did one of those ceremonies it ended
[2656.56 - 2662.20] in disaster for me awful do not go near
[2660.58 - 2664.54] anything like that
[2662.20 - 2666.82] if it wasn't for me doing medical medium
[2664.54 - 2669.00] info it could have ended really bad for
[2666.82 - 2669.00] me
[2673.54 - 2678.12] asanya says wow this is truly waking me
[2676.18 - 2681.28] up
[2678.12 - 2684.88] okay here's the next part
[2681.28 - 2687.96] remember I said fasten your seat belts
[2684.88 - 2690.58] just get ready for the ride
[2687.96 - 2693.72] I might need some lemon balm which is
[2690.58 - 2693.72] plant medicine
[2695.44 - 2700.30] good stuff
[2698.08 - 2702.58] addicted to survival there's an
[2700.30 - 2704.98] addiction process that occurs with any
[2702.58 - 2706.60] dose of psychedelics did I hear what I
[2704.98 - 2709.30] said there's an addiction process but
[2706.60 - 2711.88] wait you hear this there's an addiction
[2709.30 - 2715.24] process that occurs with any dose of
[2711.88 - 2718.42] psychedelics the addiction to
[2715.24 - 2721.54] how did we survive that
[2718.42 - 2723.70] that was a heck of a ride
[2721.54 - 2726.94] and my spiritual teacher told me how
[2723.70 - 2731.04] much I've grown by doing it
[2726.94 - 2731.04] and I think I'm ready to do it again
[2732.82 - 2737.70] does that ring a bell
[2734.98 - 2737.70] anyone
[2737.92 - 2741.34] especially when my spiritual teacher
[2739.48 - 2743.62] told me how much I've grown by doing it
[2741.34 - 2745.54] there's an addiction process that starts
[2743.62 - 2747.94] to occur
[2745.54 - 2751.54] One Of The Addictive aspects of
[2747.94 - 2754.30] psychedelics is the adrenaline surge
[2751.54 - 2757.06] that occurs when the poisons enter our
[2754.30 - 2759.46] bloodstream this is a big one when that
[2757.06 - 2761.38] adrenaline's surging
[2759.46 - 2763.00] as the poisons because the poisons enter
[2761.38 - 2766.24] the bloodstream and your adrenals just
[2763.00 - 2769.42] explode that is a spiritual
[2766.24 - 2771.58] like experience all on its own because
[2769.42 - 2773.56] it's life or death
[2771.58 - 2776.80] adrenaline being released that's your
[2773.56 - 2780.84] adrenals exploding like releasing piles
[2776.80 - 2780.84] of fear and Chaos adrenaline
[2781.42 - 2785.80] it's so addictive
[2784.18 - 2787.60] One Of The Addictive aspects of
[2785.80 - 2789.28] psychedelics is the adrenaline surge
[2787.60 - 2791.26] that occurs when the poisons enter our
[2789.28 - 2793.84] bloodstream when any kind of poison
[2791.26 - 2796.42] enters the bloodstream our body has to
[2793.84 - 2799.66] release a steroid compound
[2796.42 - 2803.56] to soften the blow so the brain hearts
[2799.66 - 2805.36] and lungs don't take the hit so hard
[2803.56 - 2808.18] when that poison enters your body that
[2805.36 - 2810.64] micro dosing poison enters the body
[2808.18 - 2814.14] a steroid compound has to be released to
[2810.64 - 2814.14] try to save your brain
[2815.32 - 2821.10] Carrie Pearson said this is totally
[2817.18 - 2821.10] mind-blowing thanks aw and SOC
[2827.62 - 2833.14] a dose even a micro dose of psychedelics
[2831.46 - 2835.66] is no different
[2833.14 - 2838.00] as our brain starts to get poisoned by
[2835.66 - 2841.84] micro dosing it sends an emergency
[2838.00 - 2843.46] signal to the brain stem and then out to
[2841.84 - 2846.10] the adrenals
[2843.46 - 2847.36] looking for the adrenals to save its
[2846.10 - 2849.04] life
[2847.36 - 2851.14] okay
[2849.04 - 2853.60] when that microdosing poison enters the
[2851.14 - 2855.52] bloodstream your brain is begging your
[2853.60 - 2859.06] adrenals to save its life
[2855.52 - 2861.22] that's the spiritual experience
[2859.06 - 2865.72] your brain
[2861.22 - 2868.18] is desperate for steroid compounds
[2865.72 - 2870.34] it's begging the adrenals to flood
[2868.18 - 2875.04] everything it has
[2870.34 - 2875.04] to try to save itself
[2875.80 - 2880.90] an intense adrenaline blend is released
[2878.44 - 2883.36] to stop Strokes from occurring when
[2880.90 - 2885.76] you're doing ayahuasca
[2883.36 - 2890.28] and other psychedelics
[2885.76 - 2890.28] and blood clots from forming
[2892.54 - 2898.48] adrenaline is the blood thinner
[2896.44 - 2899.68] when your body goes into chaos when
[2898.48 - 2902.34] you're getting the microdosing and
[2899.68 - 2902.34] psychedelics
[2902.62 - 2908.02] microdosing of psychedelics
[2905.56 - 2910.48] your brain begs for the adrenals to save
[2908.02 - 2914.02] its life so that strokes and blood clots
[2910.48 - 2916.36] don't occur I'm unpaid someone asked 154
[2914.02 - 2919.36] brain saver
[2916.36 - 2919.36] foreign
[2919.50 - 2925.12] the left hand upper paragraph could read
[2923.68 - 2926.44] along with me
[2925.12 - 2928.72] left side
[2926.44 - 2930.70] an intense adrenaline blend is released
[2928.72 - 2932.50] to stop Strokes from occurring in blood
[2930.70 - 2935.32] clots from forming
[2932.50 - 2937.42] in part by thinning the blood and in
[2935.32 - 2939.40] part by opening blood vessels back up
[2937.42 - 2943.66] with steroid compounds as the vessels
[2939.40 - 2945.52] are closing from the poison
[2943.66 - 2947.50] when you're putting in the Frog poison
[2945.52 - 2948.82] when you're putting in the psychedelics
[2947.50 - 2951.22] when you're putting in all this crazy
[2948.82 - 2953.86] psilocybins when you're putting in the
[2951.22 - 2955.78] Ayahuasca your blood vessels start to
[2953.86 - 2958.08] constrict from the poison inside your
[2955.78 - 2958.08] brain
[2958.60 - 2965.20] your brain calls out for help to your
[2962.86 - 2967.18] adrenals your adrenals release a steroid
[2965.20 - 2971.10] compound to try to stop your blood
[2967.18 - 2971.10] vessels in your brain from constricting
[2979.48 - 2984.66] so they don't close up
[2981.52 - 2984.66] and create a stroke
[2987.64 - 2993.42] I probably think this is one of the most
[2989.62 - 2993.42] profound pieces of all of this
[2994.00 - 2998.86] is as your adrenals have to flood all of
[2996.40 - 3001.80] this adrenaline which is just crazy fear
[2998.86 - 3003.66] and Chaos steroids and they have to get
[3001.80 - 3006.06] to the brain in time so that blood
[3003.66 - 3007.74] vessels in your brain don't close up and
[3006.06 - 3009.84] in your heart so blood vessels
[3007.74 - 3011.46] throughout your body don't close
[3009.84 - 3013.50] why are they closing because they're
[3011.46 - 3015.48] poisoned
[3013.50 - 3018.48] why do we need that blood thinning
[3015.48 - 3020.64] effect question mark because our immune
[3018.48 - 3023.94] system responds to any poison in the
[3020.64 - 3027.56] body as a foreign invader
[3023.94 - 3030.24] and it tries to stop the foreign
[3027.56 - 3032.34] Invader before it gets to the most
[3030.24 - 3034.50] critical places in the body such as the
[3032.34 - 3037.32] brain in the heart and the lungs
[3034.50 - 3039.66] our immune cells try to devour check
[3037.32 - 3042.24] this out when you put Ayahuasca in your
[3039.66 - 3045.08] body your immune cells are trying to
[3042.24 - 3045.08] devour it
[3046.86 - 3052.50] which can actually create a blood clot
[3050.04 - 3056.60] because it's attacking the poison
[3052.50 - 3056.60] desperately to try to stop it
[3058.26 - 3066.66] four four Starlight on YouTube my friend
[3062.16 - 3066.66] died from aneurysm post-psychedelics
[3072.54 - 3076.64] you don't want to hear that it's just it
[3074.82 - 3079.50] just kills me it's it's heartbreaking
[3076.64 - 3082.32] Reiki with Daria says I did Ayahuasca
[3079.50 - 3086.64] once was not planning to but convinced
[3082.32 - 3089.82] my Shaman convinced by Shaman I trusted
[3086.64 - 3092.64] prayed for no trips I was just coming
[3089.82 - 3095.10] for energy healing offered during the
[3092.64 - 3098.64] ceremony a month later my health issue
[3095.10 - 3100.92] started so the tip the scale was tipped
[3098.64 - 3103.56] the scale was to talk about how that
[3100.92 - 3105.78] happens our immune system is built with
[3103.56 - 3107.76] knowledge in it our immune system has
[3105.78 - 3110.16] Intelligence by the way you guys our
[3107.76 - 3113.18] immune system is highly intelligent it's
[3110.16 - 3113.18] the most intelligent
[3113.52 - 3117.30] you gotta see all those little immune
[3115.44 - 3118.98] cells if they were little brains
[3117.30 - 3121.02] our immune system is built with
[3118.98 - 3123.54] knowledge and information in it to take
[3121.02 - 3125.58] risks to protect us our immune system
[3123.54 - 3128.88] knows
[3125.58 - 3131.58] that a kerosene like corrosive substance
[3128.88 - 3134.64] adrenaline also known as epinephrine is
[3131.58 - 3137.52] coming its way in seconds
[3134.64 - 3139.20] to dissolve the clot which will separate
[3137.52 - 3141.48] the immune cells and try to open blood
[3139.20 - 3143.10] vessel passageways so there's less
[3141.48 - 3145.14] constriction and poisons can leave the
[3143.10 - 3147.00] brain and body so check this out
[3145.14 - 3149.52] your immune cells when you're on the
[3147.00 - 3151.56] psychedelics jumps on the Psychedelic
[3149.52 - 3152.88] poison and that's where the blood clot
[3151.56 - 3156.24] starts happening
[3152.88 - 3159.96] your immune cells are jumping onto the
[3156.24 - 3162.42] Frog poison psilocybins the ayahuasca
[3159.96 - 3164.16] they're jumping on it and when those
[3162.42 - 3165.12] immune cells jump on it they Clump
[3164.16 - 3166.68] together
[3165.12 - 3168.96] at the same time they're clumping
[3166.68 - 3170.52] together the poison itself is
[3168.96 - 3172.32] constricting blood vessels throughout
[3170.52 - 3174.66] the body and the Brain
[3172.32 - 3176.34] and then the adrenaline is coming and
[3174.66 - 3178.08] your immune cells know adrenaline is
[3176.34 - 3180.42] coming and it comes in to blast the
[3178.08 - 3181.92] white blood cells off the poison and
[3180.42 - 3184.20] thin out the blood so the blood vessels
[3181.92 - 3186.24] start to open this is a highly Advanced
[3184.20 - 3188.58] information this is medical medium info
[3186.24 - 3190.44] information from above original and
[3188.58 - 3192.00] unique and it will be probably just
[3190.44 - 3193.50] taken and poached like everything else
[3192.00 - 3197.00] along the way does that of the medical
[3193.50 - 3197.00] meaning books and not cited back
[3197.52 - 3201.30] but then we'll just keep on putting new
[3199.62 - 3203.76] stuff out over and over because spirited
[3201.30 - 3206.28] has an endless Treasure Trove of
[3203.76 - 3207.90] incredible information to save lives and
[3206.28 - 3210.38] what I'm talking about goes against the
[3207.90 - 3210.38] trends
[3211.08 - 3216.18] and that does mean no favors
[3214.20 - 3218.82] everybody else puts their tail between
[3216.18 - 3222.14] their legs in the health movement
[3218.82 - 3222.14] they put their head down
[3222.42 - 3228.62] and they just go with the trends
[3225.18 - 3228.62] so you never have any friction
[3229.74 - 3236.10] but I have to watch over the chronically
[3232.62 - 3238.62] ill and have their back
[3236.10 - 3242.18] because it's a somebody has to have
[3238.62 - 3242.18] the back of the chronically ill
[3243.36 - 3249.62] eat better crap and all the other stuff
[3245.46 - 3249.62] is all fun all fun and games but
[3249.66 - 3253.28] people have gone through hell and back
[3253.56 - 3258.18] they've been through a lot we have to
[3256.32 - 3259.98] always remember that
[3258.18 - 3261.36] chronic wheel have always been swept
[3259.98 - 3264.32] under the carpet
[3261.36 - 3264.32] mistreated
[3265.62 - 3271.86] now adrenaline isn't kerosene
[3269.64 - 3274.26] but it's corrosive
[3271.86 - 3276.12] it's not paint thinner yet it has a
[3274.26 - 3278.16] similar property as paint thinner and
[3276.12 - 3280.14] kerosene in it
[3278.16 - 3282.72] that can start to dissolve and break
[3280.14 - 3284.88] down a blood clot that's thickening
[3282.72 - 3288.06] that's why when somebody has a stroke
[3284.88 - 3291.50] from a blood clot their adrenaline
[3288.06 - 3293.40] starts to race and their heart does this
[3291.50 - 3297.56] adrenaline's flooding into their
[3293.40 - 3297.56] bloodstream to try to dissolve a clot
[3298.08 - 3303.36] says our immune system gathers around
[3300.24 - 3306.36] the poison in this case with psychedelic
[3303.36 - 3308.40] substances and tries to eat it up and
[3306.36 - 3310.92] absorb it a large number of white blood
[3308.40 - 3312.54] cells surround the drugs poison chemical
[3310.92 - 3314.76] compounds
[3312.54 - 3317.64] the white blood cells start to group
[3314.76 - 3320.34] together and become a clump that can get
[3317.64 - 3323.28] caught in blood vessels
[3320.34 - 3325.92] that's a blood clot
[3323.28 - 3327.60] from psychedelics then adrenaline enters
[3325.92 - 3329.64] the scene and starts to break up that
[3327.60 - 3330.96] clump
[3329.64 - 3332.76] I was like oh I just did some micro
[3330.96 - 3334.14] dosing and has no idea this is happening
[3332.76 - 3337.44] inside their body
[3334.14 - 3340.38] just did some micro dosing
[3337.44 - 3342.96] light codes on YouTube it's hard being a
[3340.38 - 3345.54] student in the field of counseling and
[3342.96 - 3347.28] the only one against psychedelics
[3345.54 - 3350.30] Hey Brother

[3353.40 - 3357.84] explanation is remarkable I did magic
[3355.14 - 3362.06] mushrooms once and my brain felt fried
[3357.84 - 3362.06] for months after I was 20 years old
[3365.58 - 3370.82] IG health of Hannah I am getting chills
[3369.12 - 3373.32] all over my body while listening to this
[3370.82 - 3376.04] it's powerful information and it's
[3373.32 - 3376.04] mind-blowing information
[3379.56 - 3384.12] this chaos
[3381.78 - 3385.38] this chaos is part of the addiction to
[3384.12 - 3387.18] psychedelics this is part of the
[3385.38 - 3389.28] addiction
[3387.18 - 3391.44] this is part of what gets people to come
[3389.28 - 3393.00] back they don't know this is happening
[3391.44 - 3395.04] inside their body but this is part of
[3393.00 - 3397.62] the addiction
[3395.04 - 3400.50] even to micro doses of psycho
[3397.62 - 3403.68] psychedelics or any other poisonous
[3400.50 - 3406.14] substance this is the chaos part of the
[3403.68 - 3408.78] addiction to psychedelics that
[3406.14 - 3412.44] adrenaline release into the bloodstream
[3408.78 - 3414.66] to thin the blood and protect the brain
[3412.44 - 3417.48] in that moment from the onslaught of
[3414.66 - 3420.90] chemical compounds also saturating the
[3417.48 - 3422.64] brain creates extreme adrenaline highs
[3420.90 - 3425.46] at the same time these poisonous
[3422.64 - 3427.68] chemical compounds the psychedelics
[3425.46 - 3430.44] such as the ones found in psychedelics
[3427.68 - 3433.26] start hitting neurotransmitters in in
[3430.44 - 3435.90] neurons and and a hallucinogenic effect
[3433.26 - 3438.54] occurs even if it's mild
[3435.90 - 3440.52] the brain affects we associate with
[3438.54 - 3443.16] these substances both the adrenaline
[3440.52 - 3446.34] High and the hallucinogenic effect occur
[3443.16 - 3451.32] because of what's being consumed is
[3446.34 - 3451.32] toxic the hallucinogenic experience
[3451.92 - 3457.08] is what we're talking about the
[3454.20 - 3459.60] aftermath is that we're coming down off
[3457.08 - 3461.88] that adrenaline High our body is in the
[3459.60 - 3464.70] process recovery as the poisonous
[3461.88 - 3470.34] chemical compound is dissipating and we
[3464.70 - 3472.88] survived it we survived that micro dose
[3470.34 - 3472.88] foreign
[3474.72 - 3479.46] it's not exactly the same as recovering
[3476.94 - 3481.38] from a party where you got completely
[3479.46 - 3483.66] drunk and stoned and puked in the
[3481.38 - 3486.78] bathroom all night and then spent the
[3483.66 - 3489.18] next day in the stupor of a hangover yet
[3486.78 - 3491.72] there are similarities and it's very
[3489.18 - 3491.72] addictive
[3493.32 - 3497.58] you want to go out again
[3495.90 - 3500.94] next week
[3497.58 - 3504.36] get totally shit-faced
[3500.94 - 3509.34] totally puke all over the toilet seat
[3504.36 - 3512.24] it's addictive page number is 154
[3509.34 - 3512.24] rain saver
[3512.88 - 3517.20] whichever substance sends your body into
[3515.10 - 3518.52] survival mode remember that survival
[3517.20 - 3521.36] mode
[3518.52 - 3524.46] their parties you'll never forget
[3521.36 - 3526.22] whether it was around a campfire doing
[3524.46 - 3528.66] micro dosing and psychedelics
[3526.22 - 3531.00] experiences that become etched in your
[3528.66 - 3534.24] Consciousness you'll never forget it the
[3531.00 - 3536.94] parties we never forgot aren't cures for
[3534.24 - 3539.16] depression anxiety brain fog fatigue or
[3536.94 - 3540.12] neurological symptoms they only worsen
[3539.16 - 3542.46] them
[3540.12 - 3546.18] one of the saddest parts of psychedelics
[3542.46 - 3549.18] is knowing a 25 year old or 28 year old
[3546.18 - 3551.42] who doesn't have any idea why they're
[3549.18 - 3551.42] sick
[3552.30 - 3558.60] he's seen a number of doctors tried a
[3555.48 - 3561.00] number of medications can't find relief
[3558.60 - 3563.58] mentally or physically and then stumbles
[3561.00 - 3566.82] into the world of this can heal you
[3563.58 - 3568.02] physically and spiritually it's one
[3566.82 - 3571.02] thing
[3568.02 - 3573.78] if you're not healing
[3571.02 - 3575.64] so you take some junky vitamins try a
[3573.78 - 3578.34] range of animal protein and plant-based
[3575.64 - 3580.14] diets try a few different therapies and
[3578.34 - 3582.12] healing techniques try conventional
[3580.14 - 3584.16] Pharmaceuticals and you're still stuck
[3582.12 - 3586.20] and you're still sick that's a better
[3584.16 - 3588.66] place to be than getting caught up in
[3586.20 - 3591.24] the world of psychedelics believing that
[3588.66 - 3594.74] maybe you have a spiritual block that's
[3591.24 - 3594.74] keeping you physically ill
[3595.56 - 3600.12] what
[3597.96 - 3602.82] so the saddest thing is like a 25 year
[3600.12 - 3605.04] old a 22 year old a 28 year old whoever
[3602.82 - 3607.46] are old right they have no idea why
[3605.04 - 3607.46] they're sick
[3607.80 - 3612.68] and they stumble across these micro
[3609.72 - 3612.68] dosing things
[3613.14 - 3616.98] and they get told you could heal
[3614.82 - 3618.84] physically and spiritually
[3616.98 - 3621.42] this is different
[3618.84 - 3622.86] than if someone was just taking junky
[3621.42 - 3624.78] vitamins
[3622.86 - 3626.16] trying a range of animal protein diets
[3624.78 - 3627.48] and plant-based diets try different
[3626.16 - 3629.52] therapies write all the different
[3627.48 - 3631.38] therapies and techniques
[3629.52 - 3632.52] and that can be bad but this is still
[3631.38 - 3634.08] different trying conventional
[3632.52 - 3635.82] Pharmaceuticals
[3634.08 - 3637.56] and you're still sick that's a better
[3635.82 - 3639.30] place to be than getting caught up in
[3637.56 - 3642.68] the world of psychedelics believing that
[3639.30 - 3642.68] maybe you have a spiritual block
[3642.90 - 3646.02] how many lives were destroyed from
[3644.88 - 3648.18] people thinking they had a spiritual
[3646.02 - 3650.40] block and meaning take psychedelic it's
[3648.18 - 3653.04] okay to think you have a spiritual block
[3650.40 - 3655.74] it's okay to think you have a spiritual
[3653.04 - 3657.90] block I'm not totally denouncing that
[3655.74 - 3661.38] I'm not totally saying are judging that
[3657.90 - 3664.38] that's okay it's taking a poisonous
[3661.38 - 3664.38] substance
[3664.86 - 3669.54] because you think that
[3666.90 - 3671.76] Roni gets free on IG I took mushrooms in
[3669.54 - 3673.92] college and got sick immediately and
[3671.76 - 3676.50] threw them back up lied to my friend
[3673.92 - 3679.02] saying I was feeling it and didn't take
[3676.50 - 3680.82] any more thank God
[3679.02 - 3683.34] that's where it goes wrong a lot of
[3680.82 - 3685.38] people lie to friends so they other
[3683.34 - 3687.42] friends don't think
[3685.38 - 3689.22] that they're weak
[3687.42 - 3692.54] and it's why tons of stories out there
[3689.22 - 3692.54] right you hear it
[3694.74 - 3698.88] it's why it's how drugs are protected
[3697.08 - 3700.38] out there too so a lot of people out
[3698.88 - 3701.88] there it's not what you did when you
[3700.38 - 3704.34] were saying you were feeling it but
[3701.88 - 3705.84] there's other people right that could
[3704.34 - 3707.88] have told you it was going to be great
[3705.84 - 3709.26] and it made you sick and the other
[3707.88 - 3712.16] people that were you know that told you
[3709.26 - 3712.16] it was going to be great
[3713.52 - 3718.92] they could also be lying right
[3716.76 - 3720.78] you were just telling see you were just
[3718.92 - 3722.58] telling your friends you were with but
[3720.78 - 3724.98] you didn't go out there telling a whole
[3722.58 - 3726.18] bunch of other people it was great but
[3724.98 - 3729.80] there were people out there that do
[3726.18 - 3729.80] they'll tell everybody it's great
[3730.08 - 3734.10] they won't tell people what really
[3731.52 - 3736.38] happened and that's why there's tons
[3734.10 - 3738.60] tons that's why there's not tons of
[3736.38 - 3739.74] stories out there there's a lot of
[3738.60 - 3742.44] stories out there people getting hurt
[3739.74 - 3743.88] but there's there's not tons of them and
[3742.44 - 3746.58] tons of them because people don't want
[3743.88 - 3750.18] to be uncool
[3746.58 - 3752.40] and they don't want to you know
[3750.18 - 3754.26] look uncool
[3752.40 - 3756.66] Siana says you literally are saving
[3754.26 - 3760.58] Humanity one person at a time aw no one
[3756.66 - 3760.58] else on the planet could say that
[3764.46 - 3769.32] Toady toad official
[3766.62 - 3771.18] it's a pretty cool handle
[3769.32 - 3772.98] what makes people feel like they had
[3771.18 - 3775.50] incredible spiritual experiences
[3772.98 - 3778.68] adrenaline from going into survival mode
[3775.50 - 3780.00] yes I was just reading about that
[3778.68 - 3782.40] foreign
[3780.00 - 3784.74] it's from the brain dying it's basically
[3782.40 - 3786.96] a near-death experience
[3784.74 - 3788.70] even on a small micro dosing level it's
[3786.96 - 3790.50] a near-death experience
[3788.70 - 3792.00] you may not think it's a near-death
[3790.50 - 3793.50] experience but your brain and your
[3792.00 - 3796.02] adrenals and your body think it's a
[3793.50 - 3798.30] near-death experience
[3796.02 - 3799.80] and your soul is scared to death of
[3798.30 - 3804.14] what's Happening
[3799.80 - 3804.14] and so that makes that spiritual
[3805.32 - 3808.98] part of it all
[3807.00 - 3811.80] when we lose time and we're exhausted
[3808.98 - 3814.44] and we don't have answers that
[3811.80 - 3817.08] are working or helping the next easy
[3814.44 - 3819.32] sell is it has to be you you're the
[3817.08 - 3819.32] problem
[3819.66 - 3826.32] this is a spiritual issue
[3823.62 - 3828.42] you're the problem
[3826.32 - 3830.46] you're sick because you have a spiritual
[3828.42 - 3832.92] issue and you're the problem
[3830.46 - 3835.62] a mental and emotional problem
[3832.92 - 3837.42] the psychedelics will shift something
[3835.62 - 3839.88] within you
[3837.42 - 3841.68] bring you spiritual growth
[3839.88 - 3843.48] take you on a spiritual journey where
[3841.68 - 3845.04] problems can be solved so the outcomes
[3843.48 - 3846.60] of how you feel physically and
[3845.04 - 3850.40] emotionally can improve and be healed
[3846.60 - 3850.40] that's what they tell you
[3850.88 - 3857.94] this is uncool for me to say this
[3854.34 - 3860.52] this is so uncool for me to say
[3857.94 - 3862.80] right here
[3860.52 - 3864.54] when we lose time and we're exhausted
[3862.80 - 3866.76] and we don't have the answers
[3864.54 - 3868.32] and nothing's helping check this out the
[3866.76 - 3870.66] next easy sell is and this is really
[3868.32 - 3874.14] uncool that I'm saying this
[3870.66 - 3876.12] it has to be you you're the problem
[3874.14 - 3878.58] this is a spiritual issue a mental and
[3876.12 - 3880.68] emotional problem the psychedelics will
[3878.58 - 3882.30] shift something within you bring you
[3880.68 - 3883.62] spiritual growth see I'm not supposed to
[3882.30 - 3885.24] be saying that bring you spiritual
[3883.62 - 3887.28] growth take you on a spiritual journey
[3885.24 - 3889.32] where problems can be solved so the
[3887.28 - 3891.30] outcomes in how you feel physically and
[3889.32 - 3892.98] emotionally can improve or be healed
[3891.30 - 3895.32] what I'm saying is people out there are
[3892.98 - 3897.60] being told this and that's uncool for me
[3895.32 - 3900.00] to stick that in the light
[3897.60 - 3902.16] I get hate and hit pieces constantly
[3900.00 - 3904.86] written about me there's always a new
[3902.16 - 3906.60] hip piece coming out on me always it's
[3904.86 - 3908.46] been happening for years because I bring
[3906.60 - 3910.20] life-saving information out there out
[3908.46 - 3912.60] there to everybody and it goes against
[3910.20 - 3915.12] the money and the trends
[3912.60 - 3916.86] but that's really really
[3915.12 - 3919.26] annoying
[3916.86 - 3921.30] when I read that part
[3919.26 - 3923.22] to the world of the microdosing money
[3921.30 - 3925.44] world oh it's all free
[3923.22 - 3927.30] microdosing is all free all those
[3925.44 - 3929.10] psychedelics is all free everything's
[3927.30 - 3930.84] free no it's a money it's an industry
[3929.10 - 3933.18] the micro dosing industry is a money
[3930.84 - 3935.04] industry so when I say this right here
[3933.18 - 3937.02] the line that they feed
[3935.04 - 3938.82] everybody to get them to do micro dosing
[3937.02 - 3940.50] when I say that I'm not supposed to say
[3938.82 - 3942.80] that because it's just uncool for me to
[3940.50 - 3942.80] say it
[3943.02 - 3946.22] but it's the truth
[3949.80 - 3953.70] I wish SOC sometimes doesn't put things
[3952.20 - 3957.18] like that in there because then I get
[3953.70 - 3959.64] more stuff more hate but SOC said it's
[3957.18 - 3961.74] going in long-term damage is not worth

[4139.06 - 4144.76] samima says and this shot takes you on
[4141.86 - 4144.76] what kind of trip
[4146.78 - 4150.22] I like that question a lot
[4150.50 - 4157.82] not the trip that Ayahuasca takes you on
[4154.70 - 4161.56] or psilocybins or frog poison
[4157.82 - 4161.56] or an OD of cacao
[4161.60 - 4166.76] finding your purpose stabilizer you can
[4163.88 - 4170.60] try it if you've lost meaning with
[4166.76 - 4174.04] anything or everything you're doing
[4170.60 - 4174.04] did you lose a meaning
[4176.66 - 4181.40] I mean
[4179.30 - 4182.56] I can even get hit with that a little
[4181.40 - 4185.60] bit
[4182.56 - 4187.34] you're working for God
[4185.60 - 4190.40] like so many of you do like everybody
[4187.34 - 4192.08] right you're working for God
[4190.40 - 4195.46] and
[4192.08 - 4195.46] then some hate comes
[4196.46 - 4201.26] to try to slow you down and he said why
[4198.98 - 4204.50] am I even doing this then
[4201.26 - 4207.68] why and then you gotta reset and be like
[4204.50 - 4211.30] I know there's reasons
[4207.68 - 4211.30] it's about saving lives
[4216.02 - 4220.52] Justine and Justina says this shot
[4218.18 - 4222.56] changed my life I left music and became
[4220.52 - 4227.08] a health coach I never felt happier and
[4222.56 - 4227.08] more aligned incredible on IG amazing
[4228.64 - 4233.12] memisub says your light blast brought
[4230.90 - 4234.44] purpose back into my life can't wait to
[4233.12 - 4235.82] try this shot and there's going to be
[4234.44 - 4237.74] another light blast I don't know when
[4235.82 - 4240.68] yet but you have to keep on the lookout
[4237.74 - 4242.96] when we heal and get free of toxins and
[4240.68 - 4245.84] toxic heavy metals and pathogens and
[4242.96 - 4247.94] we're fueling our brains and bodies with
[4245.84 - 4250.16] the right things we reconnect to our
[4247.94 - 4252.08] soul and purpose too the purpose
[4250.16 - 4254.24] stabilizer is really interesting though
[4252.08 - 4257.18] because it's uh
[4254.24 - 4259.46] blend of things no one knows works
[4257.18 - 4261.56] together it's not any berries it's
[4259.46 - 4263.72] specific berries with the parsley it's
[4261.56 - 4268.54] information from above of how it really
[4263.72 - 4268.54] helps it's designed to go into the brain
[4268.76 - 4275.06] and make a difference all right
[4272.14 - 4278.02] and it's specific amounts and specific
[4275.06 - 4278.02] ingredients
[4283.22 - 4288.02] all right you guys I'd say we get fired
[4285.98 - 4290.06] up did this quarter cup
[4288.02 - 4294.22] fresh
[4290.06 - 4294.22] or thawed blackberries
[4294.74 - 4297.46] quarter cup
[4299.90 - 4304.58] so these are frozen blackberries
[4306.14 - 4310.70] they're not
[4307.70 - 4312.82] fresh they're frozen and they're thawed
[4310.70 - 4312.82] out
[4315.56 - 4321.86] so letting a quarter cup of these in
[4319.88 - 4323.54] there we go
[4321.86 - 4326.54] so a quarter cup of fresh frozen
[4323.54 - 4326.54] raspberries
[4328.76 - 4333.16] they can be fresh or frozen I'm using
[4330.92 - 4333.16] Frozen
[4335.06 - 4341.60] they're thawed
[4337.90 - 4342.92] thawed frozen raspberries you gotta thaw
[4341.60 - 4345.44] them out
[4342.92 - 4347.54] if you don't thaw them out
[4345.44 - 4349.34] you're gonna have like some kind of
[4347.54 - 4351.98] weird ice cream
[4349.34 - 4353.96] you're making it's not gonna squeeze out
[4351.98 - 4356.24] a lot of juice if it's if it's actually
[4353.96 - 4358.46] not thawed
[4356.24 - 4360.02] so I'm sorry if I haven't said that so
[4358.46 - 4362.20] I'm putting both these quarter cups in
[4360.02 - 4362.20] here
[4363.92 - 4366.22] okay
[4366.56 - 4371.74] next is quarter cup of thawed frozen
[4369.02 - 4371.74] strawberries
[4374.12 - 4381.64] and I'm trying not to make a mess today
[4376.54 - 4381.64] because I tend to make a mess
[4382.52 - 4385.42] is what I do
[4386.66 - 4391.94] I don't know about you guys but I
[4388.94 - 4395.98] actually do make messes
[4391.94 - 4395.98] and then a quarter cup of tightly packed
[4396.26 - 4400.40] and I'm listen I'm mixing the blueberry
[4398.78 - 4402.50] powder though in the end in this
[4400.40 - 4404.36] situation
[4402.50 - 4406.46] so now I'm going to use some blueberry
[4404.36 - 4407.60] powder you can use fresh or thawed wild
[4406.46 - 4409.40] blueberries
[4407.60 - 4410.84] but I'm using blueberry powder I'm going
[4409.40 - 4413.18] to mix in
[4410.84 - 4415.94] later
[4413.18 - 4417.68] so what I'm doing is the berries
[4415.94 - 4418.82] especially when they're frozen they take
[4417.68 - 4421.66] a little time and I'm going to run some
[4418.82 - 4421.66] parsley and now
[4422.48 - 4426.62] this juicer is incredible because you
[4424.82 - 4429.44] would have to use a lot
[4426.62 - 4433.40] of berries to run through
[4429.44 - 4435.92] a juicer to get the juice out of berries
[4433.40 - 4439.28] and what I love about the juicer is it
[4435.92 - 4442.88] actually squeezes so much so there's a
[4439.28 - 4446.68] lot of compression but it's so worth it
[4442.88 - 4446.68] so I'm going to put some parsley in here
[4448.04 - 4450.82] we go
[4457.94 - 4463.42] these parsleys have big stems so I'm
[4460.16 - 4463.42] kind of putting it stem down
[4464.66 - 4469.88] there we go
[4467.00 - 4472.96] and if you tightly pack these you just
[4469.88 - 4472.96] need a little bit more here
[4475.16 - 4479.92] let me get these down in here
[4477.26 - 4479.92] there you go
[4482.18 - 4486.92] put this last one in here
[4484.22 - 4490.72] now this is your purpose stabilizer
[4486.92 - 4490.72] finding your purpose stabilizers
[4491.48 - 4494.14] there we go
[4497.24 - 4499.90] fantastic
[4502.40 - 4507.40] so I'm just squeezing a little bit more
[4504.56 - 4507.40] juice out of here
[4507.50 - 4514.96] now you'll find the pulp is really
[4511.46 - 4514.96] extra dry with berries
[4517.88 - 4523.64] Lucas
[4520.58 - 4526.16] Lucas Thompson down there
[4523.64 - 4528.70] you demonize psychedelics and push this
[4526.16 - 4528.70] garbage
[4529.00 - 4533.42] foreign garbage
[4534.44 - 4537.04] really
[4537.56 - 4542.90] is parsley garbage
[4540.50 - 4544.58] Lucas Thompson says don't buy into it
[4542.90 - 4546.94] ladies
[4544.58 - 4550.42] there's Frozen blackberries and
[4546.94 - 4550.42] raspberries garbage
[4551.30 - 4555.44] I'm just confused here
[4553.70 - 4557.18] kind of confused at that one do you have
[4555.44 - 4559.34] a better comment do you have a better
[4557.18 - 4561.44] hateful comment
[4559.34 - 4563.72] this Lucas can you give me another
[4561.44 - 4565.76] comment that I can actually understand a
[4563.72 - 4567.74] little bit like maybe some other hateful
[4565.76 - 4569.54] one
[4567.74 - 4571.40] if you got another one is what I'm
[4569.54 - 4572.66] trying to say because that one really
[4571.40 - 4574.58] sucked
[4572.66 - 4576.50] because it's hard for me to kind of even
[4574.58 - 4578.96] go along with that one for fun because
[4576.50 - 4581.48] parsley
[4578.96 - 4584.78] is incredible plant medicine
[4581.48 - 4588.02] and berries are unbelievable for our
[4584.78 - 4590.48] health so if you say that I demonized
[4588.02 - 4592.10] psychedelics but push this garbage throw
[4590.48 - 4593.78] another comment I'm just waiting to see
[4592.10 - 4594.68] if it comes up like you got something
[4593.78 - 4597.86] else
[4594.68 - 4600.08] call me ugly or something I don't know
[4597.86 - 4602.26] something that's like a better one than
[4600.08 - 4602.26] that
[4603.68 - 4607.46] I don't know
[4605.12 - 4609.74] I'm just saying
[4607.46 - 4611.00] right so what I'm doing is with this I'm
[4609.74 - 4613.76] gonna
[4611.00 - 4615.44] what I love about the screens
[4613.76 - 4617.42] if you have a strain or a screen with
[4615.44 - 4620.30] this one you can just kind of like
[4617.42 - 4623.42] massage what's left through
[4620.30 - 4626.02] Lucas buying this is like buying a get
[4623.42 - 4628.52] rich quick

[4763.88 - 4768.04] okay
[4765.26 - 4768.04] Lucas
[4768.26 - 4773.42] ask your doctor
[4771.02 - 4775.76] what's right for you
[4773.42 - 4777.62] that's what I would do I would ask your
[4775.76 - 4779.48] doctor what's right for you
[4777.62 - 4781.94] ask your doctor if the psychedelics are
[4779.48 - 4783.74] right for you
[4781.94 - 4785.66] see
[4783.74 - 4788.44] does your doctor approve of your
[4785.66 - 4788.44] psychedelic use
[4790.82 - 4794.72] it if you think taking these
[4793.04 - 4796.88] psychedelics is
[4794.72 - 4798.74] ask your doctor if it's okay that's what
[4796.88 - 4801.32] I recommend
[4798.74 - 4803.78] that's my advice friend to friend is ask

[4882.50 - 4886.94] oh my God I gotta mix in some wild
[4884.24 - 4889.94] blueberry powder
[4886.94 - 4889.94] foreign
[4892.00 - 4897.56] says there are many scientific studies
[4894.50 - 4900.92] and trials being done at the prestigious
[4897.56 - 4903.62] colleges such as Stanford University
[4900.92 - 4906.98] that are showing no adverse effects and
[4903.62 - 4908.96] very successful results look it up don't
[4906.98 - 4911.32] just take this guy's word for absolute
[4908.96 - 4911.32] truth
[4912.74 - 4917.60] do your own research
[4915.02 - 4920.36] huh
[4917.60 - 4922.64] so you mean that science has never made
[4920.36 - 4924.86] a mistake before
[4922.64 - 4927.56] that's interesting
[4924.86 - 4930.94] didn't science make the hugest mistake
[4927.56 - 4930.94] in just the last couple of years
[4931.28 - 4936.62] science like I I'm confused the science
[4934.34 - 4939.32] never makes a mistake because
[4936.62 - 4941.96] I thought science was Some Humans they
[4939.32 - 4945.50] were doing trial and era with air with
[4941.96 - 4948.26] theories and then science then
[4945.50 - 4950.12] crushes that scientific study and then
[4948.26 - 4951.44] crushes that scientific study and then
[4950.12 - 4952.88] they're wrong there then they're wrong
[4951.44 - 4955.18] there then they're wrong there it's each
[4952.88 - 4959.00] hypotheses over and over and over again
[4955.18 - 4960.08] I didn't know science like was the
[4959.00 - 4961.76] end-all
[4960.08 - 4964.04] that's great
[4961.76 - 4965.00] now that I know it I was educated that
[4964.04 - 4967.16] science
[4965.00 - 4968.78] can never be wrong
[4967.16 - 4970.76] my God they're doing studies on
[4968.78 - 4972.20] psychedelics oh then I better run out
[4970.76 - 4974.12] and get some psychedelics because
[4972.20 - 4975.92] science is studying them
[4974.12 - 4979.78] whoa
[4975.92 - 4979.78] that's actually a really good idea
[4981.62 - 4984.50] all right I'm gonna pop in a little bit
[4983.30 - 4985.46] of
[4984.50 - 4988.58] um

[5018.88 - 5024.10] doesn't put
[5020.58 - 5026.14] anti-bonding or anti
[5024.10 - 5028.06] caking agents
[5026.14 - 5031.84] see that that's how incredible the
[5028.06 - 5033.82] company is the only one that I know of
[5031.84 - 5036.52] that doesn't put anti-caking and
[5033.82 - 5038.62] anti-bonding agents in here get guess
[5036.52 - 5040.18] what all the green powders out there and
[5038.62 - 5041.68] all the different powders
[5040.18 - 5043.72] because remember she has like incredible
[5041.68 - 5046.30] powders right all the mushroom powders
[5043.72 - 5050.20] all the green powders
[5046.30 - 5053.86] there's undisclosed hidden caking a
[5050.20 - 5057.52] anti-caking agents and anti-bonding
[5053.86 - 5059.80] agents inside those powders undisclosed
[5057.52 - 5062.04] and not on the ingredient list right
[5059.80 - 5062.04] here
[5062.92 - 5066.72] and this is why I endorse these guys
[5066.94 - 5071.02] never do this
[5068.38 - 5073.18] this is incredible the only company I
[5071.02 - 5075.64] know so far
[5073.18 - 5077.32] that doesn't use the anti-bonding and
[5075.64 - 5079.42] anti-caking agents that you don't know
[5077.32 - 5080.98] you eat because if they don't they don't
[5079.42 - 5082.06] list they're allowed to not list it on
[5080.98 - 5085.12] the label
[5082.06 - 5086.68] and Bemidji I want to see a clump once
[5085.12 - 5089.02] in a while and sometimes you won't see
[5086.68 - 5090.22] clumps it's just so fresh but it's
[5089.02 - 5092.80] incredible
[5090.22 - 5096.04] Wren says my son loves the comps he
[5092.80 - 5098.10] thinks they are like candies
[5096.04 - 5102.54] foreign
[5098.10 - 5102.54] says as a scientist I believe in you
[5114.64 - 5118.48] Lucas
[5116.68 - 5120.70] you there
[5118.48 - 5122.50] a few okay
[5120.70 - 5124.36] hey
[5122.50 - 5126.76] um there was a scientist
[5124.36 - 5129.10] right here commenting and says he
[5126.76 - 5131.86] believes in me
[5129.10 - 5133.30] and the person is a scientist
[5131.86 - 5136.42] yeah
[5133.30 - 5138.64] so kind of take that for a second
[5136.42 - 5140.80] put that in your Bonnet that feather in
[5138.64 - 5141.94] your cap there or however you want to
[5140.80 - 5143.44] see it
[5141.94 - 5144.70] that doesn't make sense Feathering your
[5143.44 - 5148.54] cap
[5144.70 - 5150.88] listen Lucas not only that
[5148.54 - 5153.16] right someone said that scientists at
[5150.88 - 5154.72] Stanford are working on psychedelic
[5153.16 - 5155.62] research and that I should read the
[5154.72 - 5157.72] study
[5155.62 - 5161.14] and I had a scientist on here a second
[5157.72 - 5162.88] ago that just said he believes in me
[5161.14 - 5166.73] yeah
[5162.88 - 5168.76] well you're welcome bye
[5166.73 - 5170.44] [Music]

[5170.44 - 5173.68] powder in here I was just telling you
[5171.64 - 5175.42] and you guys know why I endorse these
[5173.68 - 5177.64] guys and that's one of the reasons which
[5175.42 - 5179.80] is
[5177.64 - 5181.42] unbelievable
[5179.80 - 5184.48] and that's the difference we're talking
[5181.42 - 5186.04] about no hidden undisclosed
[5184.48 - 5187.84] people don't realize this they don't
[5186.04 - 5190.18] know what this is they don't know that
[5187.84 - 5191.98] when all the green powders all the fruit
[5190.18 - 5193.60] and vegetable powders all of the
[5191.98 - 5195.84] mushroom powders all the greens green
[5193.60 - 5198.04] powders all the powders
[5195.84 - 5199.78] undisclosed hidden caking agent
[5198.04 - 5202.84] anti-kanking engine I can't say that
[5199.78 - 5204.58] anti-taking agents and bonding agents
[5202.84 - 5206.82] say that like four times in a row really
[5204.58 - 5206.82] quick
[5207.10 - 5210.30] they don't use that
[5212.40 - 5218.14] Cindy Layman says Lehman says the
[5216.16 - 5221.08] massive f up
[5218.14 - 5224.46] that was the last three years is brought
[5221.08 - 5227.46] to you by the science laugh out loud

[5475.48 - 5479.38] just want to say you guys what's your
[5476.80 - 5482.14] experience with this what do you feel
[5479.38 - 5484.24] leave a real story
[5482.14 - 5485.50] tag on medical medium hashtag medical me
[5484.24 - 5487.66] at the same time so I could see it I
[5485.50 - 5490.42] would love to share it
[5487.66 - 5492.82] okay so I'm in thyroid healing if you
[5490.42 - 5495.28] got a couple of minutes
[5492.82 - 5498.04] and I'm reading
[5495.28 - 5500.74] and I'm reading your Soul's gold
[5498.04 - 5504.34] since gold was discovered
[5500.74 - 5507.88] it has had a magnetic pull on us one
[5504.34 - 5509.74] that goes far beyond any monetary worth
[5507.88 - 5512.50] as a child
[5509.74 - 5514.60] did you ever wish for a gold star on
[5512.50 - 5516.64] your paper at school
[5514.60 - 5519.34] I did
[5516.64 - 5521.92] I never got a gold star
[5519.34 - 5524.08] because I'm not a genius
[5521.92 - 5526.24] as a child did you ever wish for a gold
[5524.08 - 5528.70] star on your paper at school
[5526.24 - 5530.68] it wasn't because
[5528.70 - 5534.70] you could take it
[5530.68 - 5537.70] to the pawn shop and get cash for it
[5534.70 - 5539.70] you yearned for that cheap sticker
[5537.70 - 5544.44] because of what it represented
[5539.70 - 5544.44] achievement worthiness approval
[5548.44 - 5553.30] as a child did you ever wish
[5550.96 - 5555.22] for that gold star
[5553.30 - 5557.98] because it was like
[5555.22 - 5560.34] you did good there was something about
[5557.98 - 5560.34] it
[5560.80 - 5564.64] if you have a grandmother's favorite
[5562.72 - 5566.74] locket or ring
[5564.64 - 5569.98] again
[5566.74 - 5572.56] it's not the dollar figure behind that
[5569.98 - 5574.72] gold that gives it a special place in
[5572.56 - 5580.24] your heart it's the spiritual meaning
[5574.72 - 5583.00] appreciation Nostalgia loyalty love
[5580.24 - 5587.34] and do Olympians go for the gold because
[5583.00 - 5587.34] of the market value of the metal
[5587.68 - 5593.86] do Olympian athletes take their gold
[5590.32 - 5595.68] medal to the pawn shop no they spend
[5593.86 - 5598.54] their whole lives training to win
[5595.68 - 5601.90] because of what the price stands for
[5598.54 - 5603.46] blood sweat tears Spirit Will and
[5601.90 - 5607.42] tension
[5603.46 - 5610.12] and sacrifice that come together into a
[5607.42 - 5613.42] moment of human greatness
[5610.12 - 5615.28] when spiritual and emotional meaning are
[5613.42 - 5618.94] connected
[5615.28 - 5623.26] to a piece of gold or other treasure
[5618.94 - 5626.20] its worth is on a level above price tags
[5623.26 - 5629.38] the Knights Templar went searching for
[5626.20 - 5633.04] the Holy Grail not because of the money
[5629.38 - 5635.86] they would get for this gold vessel
[5633.04 - 5639.16] but because of the mystical significance
[5635.86 - 5644.04] it was said to hold as the cup Jesus
[5639.16 - 5644.04] Christ drank from at the Last Supper
[5644.92 - 5651.22] though the knights turned up hundreds
[5647.68 - 5654.10] and hundreds of gold cups
[5651.22 - 5657.04] they were cast off as worthless because
[5654.10 - 5659.38] they didn't hold the power it was all
[5657.04 - 5662.44] about the spiritual meaning the gold
[5659.38 - 5664.86] cups weren't the cup Jesus Christ drank
[5662.44 - 5664.86] out of
[5665.20 - 5669.64] I'm here to tell you
[5667.18 - 5670.78] that you don't have to go on in Epic
[5669.64 - 5674.10] Quest
[5670.78 - 5677.32] earn anyone's approval
[5674.10 - 5681.10] inherit a family heirloom
[5677.32 - 5683.74] learn to high jump or have an
[5681.10 - 5687.58] overflowing bank account in order to
[5683.74 - 5689.20] claim the world's most precious treasure
[5687.58 - 5692.38] gold
[5689.20 - 5695.38] Platinum diamonds sapphires the Holy
[5692.38 - 5699.28] Grail the Ark of the Covenant Noah's Ark
[5695.38 - 5703.72] even the Beatles lost album
[5699.28 - 5705.76] none of these hold a candle to your
[5703.72 - 5708.82] Soul's gold
[5705.76 - 5712.48] and gems and jewels that you already
[5708.82 - 5715.12] carry inside of you
[5712.48 - 5717.34] yes you
[5715.12 - 5719.74] I know it's been a struggle to deal with
[5717.34 - 5721.12] health problems or great loss or
[5719.74 - 5723.22] hardship
[5721.12 - 5725.86] I understand where you might have
[5723.22 - 5729.18] suffered as you wondered if you were
[5725.86 - 5729.18] aging before your time
[5731.44 - 5736.78] if you thought you were calling it quits
[5733.54 - 5740.10] and if your body was giving up on you or
[5736.78 - 5740.10] even working against you
[5740.14 - 5746.28] I can only imagine what you've gone
[5742.24 - 5746.28] through in your search for answers
[5748.06 - 5753.04] it's probably left you defeated at times
[5750.58 - 5758.50] lonely despairing
[5753.04 - 5761.44] and doubtful of your own worth know this
[5758.50 - 5764.80] it's not your fault
[5761.44 - 5767.32] you didn't deserve any of it
[5764.80 - 5769.00] you didn't create your illness or
[5767.32 - 5771.94] imagine it
[5769.00 - 5776.22] you're not a bad person
[5771.94 - 5776.22] you can heal and move forward
[5777.70 - 5782.32] all that time that symptoms were
[5780.16 - 5785.50] limiting you
[5782.32 - 5788.32] they were giving you something too
[5785.50 - 5789.46] that compassion you gained from being
[5788.32 - 5793.24] vulnerable
[5789.46 - 5796.66] that wisdom that came from watching life
[5793.24 - 5799.96] at a distance that faith
[5796.66 - 5802.48] that there had to be an answer
[5799.96 - 5805.78] that Supreme patient
[5802.48 - 5807.34] patience of putting one foot in front of
[5805.78 - 5809.68] the other
[5807.34 - 5810.88] these are yours to use for the rest of
[5809.68 - 5812.68] your life
[5810.88 - 5817.36] losses
[5812.68 - 5819.18] struggles wounds suffering pain
[5817.36 - 5823.02] sorrow fear
[5819.18 - 5824.68] hardships trials
[5823.02 - 5829.24] letdowns
[5824.68 - 5831.76] and battles are not are not what any of
[5829.24 - 5833.92] us would choose
[5831.76 - 5835.60] when they visit us
[5833.92 - 5840.84] no
[5835.60 - 5840.84] we get our greatest tools and treasures
[5841.96 - 5848.20] those tools and treasures can be heavy
[5845.92 - 5851.08] to be in touch with the world suffering
[5848.20 - 5853.96] is not easy just like a bag of diamonds
[5851.08 - 5856.36] and gold it can weigh you down which is
[5853.96 - 5858.82] why it's time for you to come into the
[5856.36 - 5861.46] spiritual significance of your
[5858.82 - 5864.94] challenges because when you attach
[5861.46 - 5868.84] spiritual meaning to your Treasures
[5864.94 - 5871.74] it makes them light as light
[5868.84 - 5871.74] itself
[5872.14 - 5879.04] you've been picked out of the crowd as a
[5875.56 - 5881.92] special person who can change the world
[5879.04 - 5883.54] because you hold power
[5881.92 - 5886.30] illness
[5883.54 - 5888.40] try to hold you back
[5886.30 - 5890.56] you probably experienced symptoms along
[5888.40 - 5892.96] the way and this may have gotten you
[5890.56 - 5896.08] labeled with a whole bunch of different
[5892.96 - 5896.86] names for what was supposedly wrong with
[5896.08 - 5900.16] you
[5896.86 - 5902.02] yet the plan of you being picked on
[5900.16 - 5904.60] backfired
[5902.02 - 5907.12] instead of being constrained
[5904.60 - 5909.42] you were pushed forward and forced to
[5907.12 - 5913.18] grow and develop in your soul and spirit
[5909.42 - 5916.98] you gained understandings and insights
[5913.18 - 5916.98] that brought you closer to God
[5917.08 - 5920.26] that's your Soul's gold right there and
[5918.88 - 5922.18] thyroid healing
[5920.26 - 5924.58] that has tremendous meaning in my life
[5922.18 - 5926.68] and I hope in yours my blueberry dreams
[5924.58 - 5928.54] on IG says aw the Betrayal and broken
[5926.68 - 5931.30] trust shot
[5928.54 - 5934.84] has helped me cook
[5931.30 - 5936.64] my brain down and stop getting stuck on
[5934.84 - 5938.68] thoughts about the people that have
[5936.64 - 5941.44] disappointed me in my life
[5938.68 - 5944.44] not even therapy could help this
[5941.44 - 5946.98] it's gonna make me get emotional not
[5944.44 - 5946.98] that one
[5947.20 - 5952.00] Tammy says
[5949.06 - 5953.32] clinical trials often times contradict
[5952.00 - 5956.02] each other
[5953.32 - 5958.66] they always do
[5956.02 - 5960.46] that was me adding they always do you
[5958.66 - 5962.50] say clinical trials will back up what
[5960.46 - 5964.74] you're saying question mark I bet at the
[5962.50 - 5967.60] same time you can find clinical studies
[5964.74 - 5971.38] that won't back up what you are saying
[5967.60 - 5973.24] exactly I remember many years ago
[5971.38 - 5975.52] studies where Garlic's good for you
[5973.24 - 5977.62] Garlic's bad for you Garlic's good for
[5975.52 - 5978.82] you Garlic's bad for you studies saying
[5977.62 - 5982.32] Garlic's good for you again nope still
[5978.82 - 5982.32] you say Garlic's bad for you what is it
[5982.60 - 5987.40] Aurora says these 20 challenge days is a
[5985.78 - 5990.16] retreat for me
[5987.40 - 5994.44] and did not need to spend
[5990.16 - 5994.44] any money in luxury hotels
[5996.16 - 6001.80] that's a relief to me
[5999.70 - 6004.86] because that was the point
[6001.80 - 6006.36] 20-day free medical mean brain shot
[6004.86 - 6009.18] therapy cleanse challenge I'm getting
[6006.36 - 6011.22] sad because this is it 20 days

[6042.30 - 6047.28] things about Dr Nesbitt is he
[6045.12 - 6048.96] he self-medicates that I don't think
[6047.28 - 6050.70] it's a good idea I tell him it's not a
[6048.96 - 6052.26] good idea but he is a surgeon and he is
[6050.70 - 6054.36] a doctor so I don't I can't tell him
[6052.26 - 6058.22] what to do you can't tell Dr Nesbitt
[6054.36 - 6058.22] what to do Dr Nesbitt
[6060.00 - 6063.48] um
[6061.20 - 6066.00] yeah no we got we got a lot of people

[6071.46 - 6077.46] he says he as a doctor he thinks it's a
[6075.12 - 6079.92] bad idea
[6077.46 - 6084.72] yeah but you gotta tell them what you do
[6079.92 - 6088.98] Dr Nesbit is gonna tell you what he does
[6084.72 - 6090.72] Dr Nesbit doesn't visit his doctors in
[6088.98 - 6093.42] his Clinic anymore because they're
[6090.72 - 6095.34] always trying to give him what he thinks
[6093.42 - 6097.70] is Direction that's not suitable for him
[6095.34 - 6100.14] being he's a surgeon and a certified
[6097.70 - 6102.60] psychiatrist he says he's been
[6100.14 - 6104.28] prescribing himself medication so he's
[6102.60 - 6106.38] one of those doctors he prescribes
[6104.28 - 6108.72] medication to himself
[6106.38 - 6110.58] and uh

[6110.58 - 6115.56] lately he's been on a few different
[6113.16 - 6116.22] medications
[6115.56 - 6117.60] um
[6116.22 - 6119.52] that sounds good you shouldn't be
[6117.60 - 6121.44] telling them this Dr Nesbitt says he's
[6119.52 - 6123.30] not going to talk about it anymore he'd
[6121.44 - 6125.70] rather talk about psychedelics he said
[6123.30 - 6127.20] that he had a patient come in
[6125.70 - 6129.66] yeah
[6127.20 - 6131.22] yeah Dr Nesbitt said he had a patient

[6162.90 - 6167.22] should talk to their doctor
[6164.76 - 6170.64] about whatever they're doing
[6167.22 - 6173.58] Dr Nesbitt says that he is tired
[6170.64 - 6175.32] he says that the patient came back to
[6173.58 - 6178.20] see him
[6175.32 - 6180.96] he has a Psychiatry practice and the
[6178.20 - 6183.38] patient had extra brain fog
[6180.96 - 6187.14] the patient after eating psychedelics
[6183.38 - 6189.08] ate a big pile of dirt on the ground at
[6187.14 - 6192.30] the campsite
[6189.08 - 6195.00] there was a worm in the dirt
[6192.30 - 6198.48] he said there was a worm in the dirt and
[6195.00 - 6201.78] a toad in the dirt and the patient
[6198.48 - 6204.56] started biting the Toad's head off and
[6201.78 - 6204.56] eating the dirt
[6205.56 - 6209.52] Dr Elizabeth said that's correct
[6207.66 - 6210.84] he said that the patient he says he's
[6209.52 - 6214.98] seeing this patient
[6210.84 - 6218.34] um tomorrow again for another uh session
[6214.98 - 6220.98] the patient bit a Toad's head off
[6218.34 - 6222.06] and then he jumped on the patient jumped
[6220.98 - 6224.82] on
[6222.06 - 6226.62] another person that was at the ayahuasca
[6224.82 - 6228.96] ceremony
[6226.62 - 6230.88] he jumped on the person and he took the
[6228.96 - 6232.50] Toad's body and he tried to put it in
[6230.88 - 6234.24] that person's mouth and he held him down
[6232.50 - 6236.52] on the ground
[6234.24 - 6238.86] what did he was he losing his mind Dr
[6236.52 - 6240.78] Nesbitt he started screaming he said he
[6238.86 - 6242.94] started screaming
[6240.78 - 6244.74] and he started spitting all the dirt out
[6242.94 - 6247.44] of his mouth onto that person on the
[6244.74 - 6251.10] ground and then another person at the
[6247.44 - 6252.90] Psychedelic Gathering jumped up
[6251.10 - 6255.30] grabbed him
[6252.90 - 6257.70] dragged him down to the pond
[6255.30 - 6260.34] and threw him in in hopes that the water
[6257.70 - 6261.54] at the pond would wake him up out of his
[6260.34 - 6264.36] trip
[6261.54 - 6266.52] Dr Nesbitt said in the end they said it
[6264.36 - 6269.76] was a spiritual journey
[6266.52 - 6272.76] the person who got injured on the ground
[6269.76 - 6276.12] that the patient jumped on
[6272.76 - 6278.76] that person set was told
[6276.12 - 6280.32] at the Psychedelic Gathering that it was
[6278.76 - 6282.84] just her journey
[6280.32 - 6285.24] and not to worry if
[6282.84 - 6288.90] his patient jumped on her
[6285.24 - 6291.48] and shoved the Toad's body in her mouth
[6288.90 - 6294.54] and she almost choked to death
[6291.48 - 6296.28] and she hurt her shoulder really bad and
[6294.54 - 6297.66] everybody at the Ayahuasca Gathering
[6296.28 - 6299.10] said that it was just part of the
[6297.66 - 6300.96] spiritual journey and it'll give
[6299.10 - 6301.98] everybody spiritual give her spiritual
[6300.96 - 6304.98] growth
[6301.98 - 6309.30] Julie B Lee says he's making stuff up
[6304.98 - 6312.18] left and right fake news for sure
[6309.30 - 6315.06] Dr Nesbitt is insulted
[6312.18 - 6317.94] Dr Nesbitt doesn't make anything up Dr
[6315.06 - 6320.06] Nesbitt is a certified surgeon
[6317.94 - 6323.70] and Dr Nesbit is a certified
[6320.06 - 6326.64] psychiatrist and he's telling a story
[6323.70 - 6332.00] I'm sorry G lay B
[6326.64 - 6332.00] that you don't like Dr nesbitt's story
[6332.04 - 6338.16] yeah no I know that person was probably
[6334.56 - 6340.74] at the same place I know I know
[6338.16 - 6342.78] Dr Elizabeth says it actually happened
[6340.74 - 6344.58] sorry to say that but it actually
[6342.78 - 6346.80] happened
[6344.58 - 6349.08] um anyway let's make a long story short
[6346.80 - 6352.70] Dr Nesbitt says
[6349.08 - 6352.70] the woman who was injured
[6352.98 - 6359.18] um woke up the next morning
[6355.08 - 6359.18] had a really bad rash on her face
[6359.52 - 6364.86] and a really bad sore throat
[6362.16 - 6365.64] and went home that day early before the
[6364.86 - 6367.32] next
[6365.64 - 6370.68] ayahuasca
[6367.32 - 6372.60] Gathering was going to happen that night

[6392.70 - 6397.80] brilliant and that's true
[6395.40 - 6399.84] Dr nesbit's not happy about that though
[6397.80 - 6400.98] because Dr Nas Dr Nesbit is all about
[6399.84 - 6402.36] science
[6400.98 - 6403.50] there are things that you want it you
