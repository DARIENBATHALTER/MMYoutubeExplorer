to make sure and and i know so many

123
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
people already chronically sick

124
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,319
chronically ill but when we have these

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
flus going around so we got the plague

126
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,120

and it's been cranking up and cranking

128
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
up and cranking up

129
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
so what i've been telling friends and

130
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,519
family right

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
that have been reaching out to me so

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,160
what do i do what i do everybody's

133
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
getting sick

134
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
they're all coughing they're all sick

135
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,919
they're sick where's your microc

136
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,600
where's your zinc right where's your

137
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,919
lemon balm where's your golden seal

138
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
we're at least some of the baseline

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,960
where are some of the baseline

140
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,360
at least some of them right so that's

141
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
important okay

142
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,320
um spirulina is a great one it's a great

143
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
defense mechanism keeps the body strong

144
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,479
so if anybody gets hit with that fever

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,520
they get hit they get sick right

146
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,199
that's a great one right there okay

147
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,479
magnesium calm the body which is really

148
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,080
important for muscles so they don't

149
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,759
spasm and everything else

150
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120

that one right there

274
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
okay could be the zinc and goldenseal

275
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
right you can't go wrong on those as far

276
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
as if it was me

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200

278
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,360

i've been talking about b12 for years

285
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,399
i've been publishing information about

286
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
b12

287
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
right about b12 and and everything about

288
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
it saying xylocobalamin is not the one

289
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,399
you want

290
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,120
right and you know why people's b12

291
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
b12 level is high and how that doesn't

292
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
mean

293
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,440
it's actually working really good even

294
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,519
though you want it high

295
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
and how you want it high right and i've

296
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,480
been talking about a lot of things don't

297
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,440
do b12 shots

298
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,000
i've been talking about that too so b12

299
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
shots

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,720
like hey i'm gonna go get a b12 shot

301
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,600

302
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
just got my b12 right how b12 shots is

303
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,440
something i would never do

304
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,320
okay and how if you take the wrong b12

305
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
like stylo

306
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,160
silocobalamin how it doesn't absorb into

307
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
your nerves or your nervous system how

308
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
you can't absorb it

309
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,240
and so i did a post on b12 just recently

310
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,760

311
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600

so yeah it's important so that's you

391
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,240
so i'm like what can i do what can i do

393
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,079
i can make a mojito salad and i can talk

394
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,399
about all this stuff

395
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,399
kathy why shouldn't you take b12 shot my

396
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
doctor prescribes it for me i take one

397
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
every month sure if your doctor

398
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
prescribes it do what your doctor tells

399
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,000
you but i would never do it

400
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
and i'll tell you why it's the wrong b12

401
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
that's

402
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,440
that's one reason it's wrong b12 it's

403
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
not methylcobalamin

404
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,639
in adenosilcobalamin going to be

405
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,079
it's going to be stylocobalamin it's

406
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,680
going to be some other kind of b12 that

407
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,279
doesn't work or doesn't absorb

408
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
it's number one reason why i want

409
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
wouldn't do it but do your doctor tell

410
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,920
you but that's

411
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,959
that's that's i wouldn't do it the other

412
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
reason is

413
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,399
b12 only works orally it only works

414
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
orally

415
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
if someone feels better right after a

416
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
b12 shot that day

417
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
that's the adrenaline high from getting

418
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
a shot

419
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,079
because it squirts all your adrenaline

420
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,199
out that's what happens

421
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,399
so when you go out to get your b12 shot

422
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,360
when you go out to get your b12 shot

423
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,720
you're getting an epinephrine high

424
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,279
because when you get stuck with the

425
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,079
needle

426
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:19,839
your adrenals go

427
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,959
they just epinephrine

428
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:27,839
goes everywhere that's what happens

429
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,839
where can i buy you those bimmerjee.com

430
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
vimergy.com these and victor i m as the

431
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
mary ergy

432
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,360
dot com could also go to my supplement

433
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,959
directory

434
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,720
at medicalmedium.com i'm not sponsored

435
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,120
by these guys

436
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,680
but it's just it's just the best there

437
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
is on the market in the world right now

438
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
and if that changes i won't be

439
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,880
supporting them in

440
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,760
in doing this i'm not paid by them i'm

441
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
not sponsored

442
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,760
so what happens is that when you get too

443
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
many b12

444
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,680
shots when you get too many b12 shots

445
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,160
right

446
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,519
you get too many you can become allergic

447
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,040
to b12

448
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,160
doctors don't know this right dr stone

449
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
this so first of all when you get your

450
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,279
b12 shot the high you feel right off the

451
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,199
running is the high from the shot

452
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,880
that from the b12 shot because your

453
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,160
epinephrine is squirting out of your

454
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,839
adrenal glands

455
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,120
because you just got the b12 injection

456
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
so what happens is that

457
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,079
and the other thing is if you have b12

458
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
enter the body from the outside of the

459
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,480
body

460
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
anywhere on the outside of the body in

461
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,040
the leg in the butt

462
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
on the arm you can eventually build an

463
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,519
allergic an allergy to it

464
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
an antibody gets produced against b12

465
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
you don't want to have that

466
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,600
so i tell friends and family don't get

467
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,720
the b12 shot

468
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,720
do b12 orally

469
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,519
i said i always tell friends and family

470
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,240
ivs are different that's a different

471
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
story

472
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
intravenous is different story that's

473
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,519
fine

474
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,399
intravenous is different lucy cohn good

475
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,040
to see you

476
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,920
intravenous is in the vein that's in the

477
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
vein

478
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
right that's in your vein it's my veins

479
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,440
on my hand here

480
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:22,160
right so that's in the vein so if

481
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,759
if they put a catheter in your vein

482
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,720
that's an iv vitamin nutritional therapy

483
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,639
and they stick a catheter in your vein

484
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,720
that's different you can't build an

485
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,480
allergic reaction to it it's different

486
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
it's different when it's a shock

487
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
different one is the b12 shot when it's

488
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
the b12 shot it's an

489
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,079
entirely different situation when it's a

490
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,079
b12 shot

491
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
my doctor told me i was b12 deficient

492
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,279
when i was

493
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,759
a meat eater and she was giving me b12

494
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,600
shots

495
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,360
five years ago i went plant-based and

496
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
started the vimergy b12 and i'm no

497
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,000
longer b12 deficient and one of the

498
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,519
reasons why maria

499
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,279
amazing maria donsky

500
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,759
what's amazing is that the i hear that a

501
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,760
lot

502
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,039
that that's the difference with b12 with

503
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,039
the vimergy b12

504
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,559
and i don't hear that from with other

505
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
b12s too by the way

506
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,720
and i hear that with the vimergy b12 all

507
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,079

okay look people are already at an

967
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,040
unfair

968
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,160
advantage they're riddled in pathogens

969
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,040
epstein-barr

970
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,480
sediment virus shingles hhv-6 they're

972
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,119
problems

973

nerve pain and trigeminal neuralgia and

975
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,359
plantar fasciitis

976
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,000
skin problems it's vertigo dizziness eye

977
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,280
floaters ringing in the ears

978
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,640
people got enough problems because

979
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,079
they're viral and they're sick so let's

980
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,839
just moderation what

981
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,839
how about moderation sounds real good

982
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,920
viruses were released by classified

983
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
medical industries

984
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,040
years ago and our body wasn't set up for

985
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,800
those

986
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,839
so what moderation's gonna fix it

987
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,839
moderation doesn't fix anything

988
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,680
so i'm making a mojito salad

989
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,680
and for some reason i went off track

990
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
so here's what i'm making just so you

991
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,839
guys know

992
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,839
someone wait that doesn't look like it

993
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,960
here we go

994
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,599
yeah disaster relief lorraine

995
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,760
everybody's on acid and everybody needs

996
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,880
to get alkaline but in the proper way by

997
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,119
the way that's some keto salad i'm

998
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,000
making which is fruit

999
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,599
antioxidants knocking down those free

1000
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,599
radicals right there right

1001
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,599
we're talking about keeping the immune

1002
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,280
system strong because whether anybody

1003
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,000
knows it or not they may not be aware

1004
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,520
but there is

1005
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,960
a vicious little bug buying around

1006
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,040
and people are getting hit with it

1007
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,640
really hard left and right

1008
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,160
left and right and it's setting a lot of

1009
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,280
people back with chronic illness it's

1010
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,280
cryptical

1011
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,119
to have the zinc so that's the vimergy

1012
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,480
zinc it's quick you can use

1013
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,520
you can do whatever your doctor tells

1014
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,720
you do your doctor tell you but i've

1015
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
been telling family and friends about

1016
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,960
the zinc the golden seal

1017
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,079
about the golden seal about the b12

1018
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,000
about the cat's claw

1019
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,000
how critical this is and the micro stick

1020
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,240
not sponsored by those guys but that was

1021
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,000
something i just wanna remind any

1022
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,280
anybody who just came on now who's like

1023
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,960
what's going on all right so we're

1024
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,839
making a salad let's do it i'm gonna get

1025
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,839
my knife out right now

1026
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,280
a couple of things i want to tell

1027
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,400
everybody what you look when you look

1028
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,599
outside in the world

1029
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,560
everybody's really acidic they're really

1030
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,960
really acidic

1031
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,320
they're filled with acid they're eating

1032
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
foods that create

1033
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,160
acid everyone is on acid they're having

1034
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,119
an acid trip

1035
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,320
the acids do damage over time it's what

1036
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,680
ages people

1037
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,040
so what people are being told when

1038
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,000
they're told to eat their eggs and

1039
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,119
they're told to eat all

1040
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,240
their meat i'm not against me

1041
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,520
for one reason is because it doesn't

1042
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,720
feed a pathogen but it does keep you

1043
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,760
really acidic

1044
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,280
i'm not against peanut butter for vegans

1045
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,880
if they want to eat it wherever the

1046
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,440
peanut butter went

1047
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,920
if they want to eat it but the problem

1048
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
is

1049
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,480
it still makes you really acidic fat

1050
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,800
makes you acidy and more

1051
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,040
acidy inside your body fatty acids

1052
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,720
fatty acids everybody's fatting

1053
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,160
themselves to death

1054
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,400
it's all that fat and and that fat makes

1055
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,560
you

1056
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,640
really really acidic so whether you're

1057
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,720
an animal protein dude or gal and you're

1058
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,800
doing the animal proteins left and right

1059
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,040
where you're a vegan plant-based dude or

1060
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,000
gal and you're doing all the nut butters

1061
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,920
and the oils you're making yourself

1062
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,359
acidic all the time so then when

1063
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,400
pathogens come around

1064
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:51,440
like the plague you're more susceptible

1065
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,839
because acids also deplete us

1066
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,560
of all those minerals of all those

1067
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,560
vitamins and nutrients they deplete us

1068
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,160
okay sure an avocado's healthy it gives

1069
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
you some vitamins and nutrients but you

1070
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,720
lose

1071
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,400
more of them because when you overeat

1072
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,400
avocado the fat

1073
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,440
causes a depletion all the fatty acid

1074
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,599
so when you're saying well you know

1075
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,640
sunflower seeds are really you know

1076
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,680
really healthy it's a healthy fat

1077
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,520
but when we're eating too much of them

1078
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,960
while we're eating other fats and we're

1079
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,720
eating the nuts the seeds the nut

1080
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
butters the fats the peanut butters the

1081
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,520
chocolate

1082
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,359
the chicken the fish the meat we're

1083
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,760
always fatted out and then we get

1084
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,280
depleted we're running on acid

1085
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,800
we're living on acid we're having an

1086
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,119
acid trip i'm going to chop up some

1087
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,920
strawberries here

1088
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,560
and that that's where we that's where it

1089
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,520
gets us

1090
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640
right so i'm doing a little strawberry

1091
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,000

people are sick it's not fruit

1103
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,680
it's pathogens it's metals right

1104
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,200
and then it's not eating or drinking the

1105
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,680

00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,400
chair are you kidding me

1115
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,560
it's from chocolate all the chocolate

1116
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,800
they've been eating all these years

1117
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,359
it's from the caffeine dissolving teeth

1118
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,960
over time

1119
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,280
let me tell you something about caffeine

1120
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,960
not only is it tremendously acidic

1121
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,440
in the body all right but it depletes

1122
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,000
you of

1123
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
every nutrient that you have that's

1124
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,280
available

1125
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,000
it depletes it squeezes it right out of

1126
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
you

1127
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,040
vinegar does the same thing it depletes

1128
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,319
you

1129
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,920
so we walk around to pleat it right

1130
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:21,839
so i'm chopping up some strawberries

1131
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,839
right here okay

1132
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,319
leads to bone loss tooth enamel

1133
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,880
leeches calcium out of you that's what

1134
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,880
it does it leeches all the calcium out

1135
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,839
that's what it does what happens is you

1136
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,920
end up becoming a buffer for all the

1137
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,359
poison you're putting inside of you you

1138
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,400
become a buffer

1139
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,440
you know what that is you become the

1140
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,240
buffer

1141
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,000
your bones become the buffer to save

1142
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,680
your life

1143
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,119
so you want to keep on you you're going

1144
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,400
to be on all that acid you're going to

1145
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,480
be on the peanut butter you're going to

1146
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,880
be on nuts and seeds all the time

1147
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,000
healthy fats are okay have a little bit

1148
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,640
here and there right

1149
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,040
little touch of it here and there but

1150
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,160
people are drowning themselves in it is

1151
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,160
what's happening

1152
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,920
so then we lose our bones we lose our

1153
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,000
skeleton frame we lose it we get

1154
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,720
osteopenia osteoporosis you don't even

1155
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,359
see it your

1156
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,040
your bones get porous your teeth get

1157
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,160
porous and then they start collapsing

1158
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,599
later on

1159
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,040
you're fine in your 20s and you're

1160
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,920
drinking your coffee and your caffeine

1161
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,440
and you're doing your thing and you're

1162
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,720
doing your functional medicine stuff and

1163
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,079
you're doing your probiotic and you

1164
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,520
think you're totally on it you're doing

1165
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,640
your little avocado toast

1166
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,480
and boom later on your skin age is fast

1167
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,920
you got to get botox left in right

1168
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
because people are getting botox left

1169
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,319
and right

1170
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,760
your teeth start to fall apart and then

1171
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,200
you got to get all the veneers and all

1172
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,640
the other stuff and the implants and

1173
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,400
stuff people don't realize it

1174
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,599
dino says does natural alkaline water

1175
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,240
ph 9.5 okay to drink

1176
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,839
does that help with the body's acid is

1177
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
it natural coming out of an

1178
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,280
aquifer is it natural coming out of a

1179
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,520
spring

1180
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,440
so if you have a high ph water coming

1181
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,760
out of a spring you can drink it it

1182
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,560
wasn't manufactured

1183
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,960
that's different that's different you

1184
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,040
don't

1185
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,960
have to have alkaline water that's

1186
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,800
coming out of aquifer or spring

1187
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,839
in order to heal and stay alkaline just

1188
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,400
need some leafy greens and some celery

1189
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,040
juice right

1190
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,680
yes from a spring then it's okay from a

1191
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,599
spring

1192
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,040
then it's okay all right it's not

1193
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,640
manufactured

1194
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,960
exactly it's very important to know it

1195
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,359
wasn't manipulated the water wasn't

1196
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,319
manipulated it wasn't manufactured keep

1197
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,400
that in mind that's

1198
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,760
that's why it's okay sadino that's okay

1199
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,200
good to see you dina

1200
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,880
i see you leave comments on youtube

1201
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,560
every now and then

1202
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,440
um so what happens is we're so acidy out

1203
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,000
if that even makes sense like a word

1204
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,160
we're so

1205
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
drowning in our own assets because it's

1206
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,680
created by all the stuff we're also

1207
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,760
eating and then the stress adds to it

1208
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,079
from all adrenaline here's what happens

1209
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
too

1210
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,119
when you do your caffeine and you do

1211
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,720
your coffee and you do your chocolate

1212
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,640
you're on a psychoactive drug which

1213
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,480
triggers off your adrenals and now

1214
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,480
epinephrine is flooding your system and

1215
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,640
epinephrine is acidic

1216
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,880
and it starts to burn your nerves and

1217
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,839
bones over time

1218
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,560
right if anybody's going to talk about

1219
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,599
moderation

1220
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,400
talk about making sure that you slow

1221
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,880
down or

1222
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,400
bring to a halt eventually some of those

1223
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,720
bad things

1224
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,839
nutritional yeast all that msg blows out

1225
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,880
your brain

1226
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,400
blows out your brain stem msg's so toxic

1227
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,839
to your brain you guys it builds up and

1228
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,359
it builds up and it builds up

1229
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,040
so i talk about all those toxic

1230
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,880
supplements that have natural flavorings

1231
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,079
and flavor and flavors in it

1232
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,079
all that stuff that's all msg elio

1233
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,640
how do i get my protein to build muscle

1234
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,280
mass if i don't eat chicken turkey or

1235
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,400
meat sounds like you've never read one

1236
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,400
thing from medical medium

1237
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,480
sounds like you know that's a good

1238
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,680
question though okay

1239
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,480
that that's that's a really good

1240
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,119
question okay um i i just have to

1241
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,680

1243
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,640
just hold on okay

1244
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,760
protein robot protein robot protein

1245
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,319
robot protein robot protein protein

1246
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,920

1247
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,359
need to build muscle meat protein i

1248
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,359
shall kill a pig eat a pig

1249
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,839

1254
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,400
give me strength protein heals me

1255
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,040
protein heals me everybody says protein

1256
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,839

1257
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,839
rub kill the cow

1258
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,960
chicken chicken kill the chicken brookie

1259
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,280
here's how it works

1260
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,720
i don't think that was the best robot

1261
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,400
but whatever

1262
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,920
okay protein

1263
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:14,160
doesn't kill off a pathogen that's

1264
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,839
weakening you right protein

1265
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:22,400
doesn't give you nutrients

1266
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:26,640
minerals antioxidants protein

1267
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,960
doesn't even build muscle it doesn't

1268
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,319
what builds muscle is glucose and

1269
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,200
mineral salts

1270
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,880
that's it builds muscle so you gotta

1271
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,240
have sugar to build muscle

1272
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,079
you know what happens here's i'm gonna

1273
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,400
tell you right now okay

1274
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,599
when someone's sick with chronic illness

1275
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960
right

1276
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,599
when someone's actually sick with

1277
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,960
chronic illness and

1278
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,359
they're wasting away because they got

1279
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,280
me cfs they got chronic fatigue syndrome

1280
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,440
they got fibromyalgia so they can't

1281
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,040
they can't work out and they're losing

1282
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,240
muscle

1283
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,119
the worst thing ever for them

1284
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,480
is to get caught up in the protein law

1285
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,000
that protein law

1286
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,040
will kill them i have watched doctors

1287
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,640
contact me over the last 35 years

1288
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,599
telling me aw i got a patient bed ridden

1289
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,400
they're atrophying what are you feeding

1290
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,079
them

1291
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,520
feeding them lots of protein you're

1292
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,680
gonna kill them quick

1293
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,960
you're gonna kill the person quick

1294
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,880
they're gonna die

1295
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,240
what do you mean die they need protein

1296
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,400
they have no muscles

1297
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,319
they're laying in bed sick you're gonna

1298
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,079
kill them

1299
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:35,520
carbohydrates build a muscle if they're

1300
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,280
in bed and they're bedridden you better

1301
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,119
be giving them bananas you better be

1302
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,960
giving them potatoes you better be

1303
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,000
giving them some fruit

1304
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,920
yeah you better because you in order to

1305
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,119
build a muscle you have to have two

1306
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
components one is

1307
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,640
a carbohydrate to go into the muscle

1308
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,280
cells

1309
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,160
to sustain it so it doesn't atrophy the

1310
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,520
other thing is

1311
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,880
you got to be able to use your muscle

1312
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,240
and when you're chronically ill you

1313
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,160
can't use your muscle

1314
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,280
so then you better at least have that

1315
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,760
carbohydrate available

1316
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,559
it's why people have to do that bulk and

1317
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,640
cutting thing

1318
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,280
they have to bring in the carbs to bulk

1319
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,599
up all those weight lifter dudes

1320
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,319
even pros that reach out to me that are

1321
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,720
on the scene

1322
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,920
in their pros they reach out because

1323
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,319
you're like what do i do

1324
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,079
you're missing the carbs because if you

1325
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,640
want to go and try to build your muscle

1326
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,200
on just

1327
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,559
fat and animal protein you're not going

1328
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,880
to sustain those muscles

1329
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,240
and so what they do is they bulk up by

1330
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
adding the carbs in

1331
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,599
that's the bulking and cutting the

1332
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,200
reason why they're bulking is because

1333
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,599
they're adding the carbs in

1334
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,640
that's what's making them bulk up that's

1335
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,440
the whole point

1336
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,160
and then when they drop back the carbs

1337
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,640
and they drop

1338
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,559
drop back the calories they drop

1339
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,200
everything down their portions

1340
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,359
they they try to lose a little bit that

1341
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,400
excess fat

1342
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,839
but they still get fat from the fat

1343
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,440
but then they get stuck because they're

1344
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,839
losing muscle so then they have to do

1345
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,079
the

1346
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,599
carbs again they do the bulking and

1347
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,359
cutting

1348
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,200
what's giving them the bulk in their

1349
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,440
muscle is the carb

1350
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,880
aspect it's the carb it's not the

1351
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,680
protein

1352
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,119
because the brain washing is insane

1353
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,760
reclaims the heal

1354
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,880
it's a great question though okay

1355
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,760
re-cleanse the heel

1356
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,800
well medical medium book one new

1357
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,280

story

reaching for a whole bag of dried fruit

1404
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,760

1405
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,880

gullible it's just easy to

1424
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:52,319
just fall into the bs

1425
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,240
it's not enough truth out there and

1426
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:56,319
there's too much bs

1427
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,640
it's just sad this is heartbreaking

1428
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,640
really

1429
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,119
so i'm going to throw some raspberries

1430
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,119
in here

1431
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,760

1434
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,119
yeah but eventually if it's just me and

1435
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,640
i'm not anti-meat if someone wants to be

1436
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,160
on meat i'm just i'm

1437
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,359
i want to make sure if someone's animal

1438
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
protein i'm not against an animal

1439
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,520
protein people

1440
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,440
i'm not against vegans people think i

1441
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,359
hate vegans

1442
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
and i know vegans hate me because

1443
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,559
they're like oh he doesn't know anything

1444
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,559
about veganism

1445
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,079
okay sure more people healed and chronic

1446
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,359
illness ever before in history because

1447
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,160
of medical media information but i don't

1448
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,359
know nothing

1449
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,520
most powerful people in the world

1450
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,040
reaching out to me every day

1451
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,040
just most powerful people in the world

1452
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,720
knocking on my door constantly

1453
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,359
will we have to like fend them off

1454
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,040
because i got just too much going on

1455
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,079
because they've seen the 50 doctors and

1456
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,680
the best neurologists and they take

1457
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,040
their private jets all around the planet

1458
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,400
all around the globe their private jets

1459
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,599
doing every therapy possible and they're

1460
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,800
knocking on my door

1461
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,800
sure i don't know anything about

1462
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,839
veganism

1463
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,240
and then people steal medical medium

1464
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,240
information left and right and they plug

1465
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,079
it into everything

1466
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,280
so you'll have vegans actually being

1467
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:18,400
saying oh medical medium doesn't know

1468
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,760
anything meanwhile they're using medical

1469
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,760
medium tools that were given to the

1470
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,800
vegan community in the last 35 years

1471
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,319
from

1472
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,520
me and not from science and research

1473
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,319
because science research didn't have the

1474
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,760
info so where did the info come from

1475
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,359
i'm the only one hearing a voice that

1476
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,040
brought in advanced medical medical

1477
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,800
information into the world

1478
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,319
i've also lectured on the scene for

1479
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,000
years teaching people

1480
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,680
and even science research skills medical

1481
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,839
medium information

1482
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,839
all the time put some grapes in here

1483
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,040
do not mono eat grapes

1484
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,599
okay grapes that they're a medicinal

1485
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,000
food

1486
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,319
absolutely don't mono eat grapes

1487
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
don't mono eat blackberries don't just

1488
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,040
eat blackberries for weeks and weeks and

1489
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,040
weeks and no other food

1490
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:11,839
it's too astringent too cleansing

1491
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,839
but you can have grapes every day what

1492
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,000
you're looking right here is antivirals

1493
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:22,160
antibacterials

1494
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,160
anti pathogens anti

1495
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,319
oxidants

1496
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,000
so i'm making some fruit salad here

1497
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,839
minerals trace minerals

1498
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,839
macro minerals right

1499
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,200
glucose

1500
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
so

1501
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,440
all right let's keep on going a little

1502
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,920
bit

1503
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,599
now what people have to understand

1504
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,359
something there is sugar in meat

1505
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,359
the animal has its own blood sugar the

1506
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,200
animal eats grass say you got a cow and

1507
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:57,040
the cow is eating grass right

1508
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,079
so say your cow is eating grass okay

1509
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,480
right all that sugar from

1510
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:07,200
the grass gets

1511
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,839
concentrated into the cow's blood

1512
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,680
and then the blood that's in the meat is

1513
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:15,920
sugar so you can

1514
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,839
you could live on meat by itself

1515
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,599
you could but it's still not enough

1516
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:24,160
glucose you can do it for a while

1517
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,440
but you can't do it long term especially

1518
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,799
if you're sick and your neurological

1519
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,559
system is compromised

1520
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:31,119
if you're some dude and you haven't been

1521
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,200
sick yet you've got nothing going on

1522
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,359
you get a sniffle once every couple of

1523
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,400
years you haven't had pathogens affect

1524
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,119
you yet because you haven't gotten the

1525
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,640
pathogens

1526
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,520
you haven't gotten enough heavy metals

1527
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,359
yet you haven't had any of that right

1528
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,760
and you haven't been sick yet so say

1529
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,520
you're a dude that hasn't been sick yet

1530
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,839
you will but you haven't been sick now

1531
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,680
yet you're young you're 20 years old

1532
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,920
right you're in the gym you're working

1533
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,760
out you can be on meat for a little

1534
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,200
while and not see a decline

1535
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,920
yet but eventually you'll just see a

1536
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,119
decline after just six months being just

1537
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,079
on need alone you're going to see

1538
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,839
decline in your muscles

1539
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,839
you'll start losing your muscle mass

1540
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,200
start going away be 20 years old say why

1541
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,599
am i not building muscles you start

1542
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,680
losing your muscle mass

1543
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,799
and you start aging fast too your skin

1544
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,839
turns to you just start aging fast

1545
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,440
that's what's happening though why do

1546
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,640
you think the carnivore movement put in

1547
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,480
honey did you guys know that

1548
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,480
carnivore movement why did you need

1549
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,880
honey i'm that's a head scratcher for me

1550
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,640
um carnivore movement completely

1551
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,200
anti-sugary anti-fruit anti-anything

1552
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,960
sweet

1553
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,799
scratching my head a little bit on that

1554
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,440
why did you guys bring in honey

1555
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,799
recently hmm because you guys were

1556
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,960
sucking it out

1557
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,799
you guys were struggling because you

1558
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,559
were noticing too many people could not

1559
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,040
handle it and do it they were binging on

1560
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,200
carbs

1561
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,040
yeah i'm on the carnivore diet let me

1562
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,319
just feed on a whole bunch of yeah i'm

1563
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,240
on the carnivore diet

1564
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,920
but i'm just not going to tell my

1565
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,079
carnivore teacher what i'm doing here

1566
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,960
yeah i'm on a carnivore time

1567
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,920
okay back on the carnivore diet they

1568
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,799
needed sugar

1569
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,680
so they put honey in the carnivore diet

1570
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,920
teresa

1571
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,880
how's diabetes happening then too much

1572
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,440
bad sugar

1573
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,880
bad sugar sugar has nothing to do with

1574
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,559
diabetes

1575
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,119
besides diabetics need sugar to stay

1576
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:14,799
alive is that interesting

1577
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,240
a diabetic needs sugar to stay alive

1578
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,960
okay you find you find a type 1 diabetic

1579
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,359
on a bus

1580
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,119
passed out you better get some orange

1581
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,000
juice to the lips as fast as possible or

1582
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,880
they're going to go into a coma

1583
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,319
why is sugar the problem with diabetes

1584
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,760
it's fat

1585
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:35,359
it's fat fat is how you get insulin

1586
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,280
resistance fat is what kills the

1587
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,240
pancreas it's not sugar

1588
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,240
you can't have sugar and fat together

1589
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,760
because the fat ruins everything it

1590
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,040
stops the sugar from going into your

1591
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,480
cells it's not sugar that causes

1592
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,680
diabetes you guys it's the fat that

1593
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,040
causes diabetes

1594
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,400
originally that's all medical medium

1595
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,520
information going back years ago now

1596
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,880
there's a whole bunch of people

1597
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,640
practicing that there's doctors

1598
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,319
practicing that there's there's all

1599
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,880
kinds of people out there talking about

1600
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,720
it

1601
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,559
sugar okay gets blocked from the fat so

1602
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,920
it can't enter into your cells so then

1603
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,200
you can't get the glucose you need and

1604
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,839
then as a diabetic

1605
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,280
or somebody with hypoglycemia and

1606
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:11,200
hyperglycemia you get just all screwed

1607
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,799
up because the sugar is blocked it's not

1608
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,720
getting into the cells

1609
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,480
it's not getting into the cells it's the

1610
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,319
fat in this that gets you you see this

1611
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,760
you guys it's the fat inside of this

1612
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,319
that gets you

1613
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,000
fat is in ice cream it's not the sugar

1614
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,119
in ice cream it's fat that's in ice

1615
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,680
cream

1616
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,400
and guess what back to the back to the

1617
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,799
whole

1618
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,160
moral of the story or whatever back to

1619
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:35,520
the whole story is

1620
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,640
we're acidic we're on acid because we're

1621
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,440
doing so much

1622
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,799
fat we're we're on so much acid we're

1623
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:45,680
tripping every day on acid

1624
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:47,440
let's finish this up we got strawberries

out is keep on doing the chocolate

1733
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,480
caffeine

1734
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,760
the vinegar nutritional yeast just all

1735
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,960
these things

1736
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:10,400
right too much meat i support animal

1737
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
protein people i support

1738
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,680
plant-based and vegan people i just want

1739
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,200
them to have the tools so they can heal

1740
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,640
if they want to be either or

1741
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,039
if your plant-based stay plant-based

1742
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,319
don't leave it don't stop it

1743
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,440
if you're animal protein that's what you

1744
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,359
want that's where your heart desires

1745
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,400
then stay there

we can still work on healing regardless

1747
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,520
but we just have to do a couple of

1748
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,079
things or a few things depending on

1749
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,440

any eggs happening okay all these matter

1780
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,240
is your celery juice high pressure

1781
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,839
pasteurized because

1782
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:48,160
high pressure pasteurized which is the

1783
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,839
bad stuff hpp

1784
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,200
does your cellar juice have lemon in it

1785
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,799
does it have ice in it does have water

1786
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,319
in it these are all bad things is it 32

1787
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,119
ounces celery juice or eight ounces of

1788
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:58,079
celery juice

1789
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,440
i want you to be your own detective is

1790
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,960
anybody out there jumping into new

1791
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,400
medical treatments right like you said

1792
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,280
no new medical treatments are offered

1793
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,599
all the time

1794
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,440
sometimes even most of the time new

1795
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,119
medical treatments set people back

1796
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,480
and then they're doing that at the same

1797
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,839
time they're trying to do something good

1798
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,119
and they can't see the results yet

1799
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,039
because they've already done something

1800
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,799
that wasn't good

1801
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,480
it happens neurological line like the

1802
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,039
medical treatments for neurological lyme

1803
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,359
is just

1804
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,079
hammering them with antibiotics

1805
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,319
antibiotics

1806
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,359
antibiotics i can't tell you how many

1807
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,039
people they're

1808
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,559
they're they get their neurological lyme

1809
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,839
diagnosis and then they're at the

1810
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,400
doctor's office and they're both

1811
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,680
slamming them with antibiotics the worst

1812
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,880
kind of antibiotics

1813
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,280
and then they're like why isn't my

1814
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,880
celery juice helping why isn't my

1815
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,799
why isn't my eight ounces of celery

1816
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,160
juice helping and how many blood draws i

1817
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,319
want everybody to be their own detective

1818
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,839
how many blood draws is someone getting

1819
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:47,520
because if you're getting blood draws

1820
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,440
you just had another blood test

1821
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,119
boom you've just been set back because

1822
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,559
they'll take they'll they'll drain you

1823
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,680
to death

1824
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:58,240
they'll drain someone to death people

1825
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,160
you people get cancer they take blood

1826
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,680
from you every week until you did you

1827
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,720
literally take everything out of your

1828
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,079
whole immune system you didn't even

1829
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,079
stand a chance the way they

1830
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:10,240
drain your blood so it's um unbelievable

1831
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,319
another thing people get new bugs they

1832
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,480
get new bugs happening

1833
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,480
and they need to go further to clean up

1834
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,119
their strap in their epstein bars

1835
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,720
so they don't get much worse also you

1836
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,359
may not be recovering from a small

1837
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,520
amount of

1838
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:25,760
celery juice yet but is it keeping you

1839
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,760
from getting worse

1840
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,119
keep that like in the detective hat

1841
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,799
right there is it keeping you from

1842
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,760
getting worse

1843
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,680
and then you just need to go further
