blood draw getting your blood your blood

they take too much blood

143
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
period that's what they do this is an

144
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
episode about

145
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
protecting you so when you get your

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
blood tests when you get your blood

147
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,440
drawn

148
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
you can protect your immune system

149
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,120
protect your body because blood draw

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,440
sets people back and it keeps a lot of

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
people sick for the rest of their life

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
they go to the doctor and their immune

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
system is removed in their blood draw

154
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,039
and that that blood they take all gets

155
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,919
thrown away

156
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,639
except for a smidgen of it and what

157
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,680
happens is

158
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,120
your white count goes out boom you get

159
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,960
the blood drawn your white count goes

160
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
out with it okay your white blood cells

161
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,039
they all go out with it

162
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
and what people don't understand is your

163
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,800
immune system is there to protect

164
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
protect your heart

165
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
okay it's to protect your heart that's

166
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,039
what your immune system is there for

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,520
it's to protect your heart and that's

168
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,720
what and what happens is that

169
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,400
your immune system is in your

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
bloodstream so you don't get an

171
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,919
infection to the heart or an infection

172
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
to the brain

173
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,440
really important to know and what they

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,880

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
so what happens is all these women right

192
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
and all these men

193
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,000
they go to get their blood tested men

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
and women

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,080
and they draw the same amount of blood

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,240
from a 220 pound male

197
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,560
6 foot 5 220 230 pound male

198
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,360
they draw the same amount of blood that

199
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,160
they would a

200
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
hundred pound female they they that's

201
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,680
what they do

202
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,160
and there's so many holes in all of this

203
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919

like that now you're backwards that's

259
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
you're already dealing with some kind of

267
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,640
symptom

268
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720

immune system is already low

275
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,320
they're already struggling they need

276
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,120
their immune cells to be at the top

277
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
of the the game their game top of their

278

all this blood constantly and you get

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,399

285
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240

so that's important we lose electrolytes

334
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
that's why the watermelon is important

335
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
we lose electrolytes

336
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,440

343
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
so we can give

344
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,200
life-saving blood for other people that

345
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,680
get into bad car accidents that have

346
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,320
that need a life-saving surgery you know

347
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
they need

348
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,000
they need their heart okay valves

349
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,760
replaced and

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,120
they might need or people who need blood

351
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,959
transfusions because

352
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,800
they're losing blood for some reason

353
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,519
right i want people to be able to donate

354
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,320
blood but

355
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
but blood donating can also be

356
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,079
detrimental

357
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,800
and bring you to a place of a very ill

358
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,040
person

359
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
okay and bringing to a place of needing

360
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
to

361
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,560
actually get a blood transfusion to

362
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,720
someday taking to a place of a very bad

363
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,480
in a bad way if you're not protecting

364
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
yourself i talk about if you're sick

365
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,959
with chronic illness you shouldn't give

366
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,399
blood

367
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,639
but it should be for the people who are

368
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
healthy and strong or feel healthy and

369
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,079
strong

370
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,920
and even when they do it there's ways of

371
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,560
protecting themselves

372
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,399
before you give donate blood there's a

373
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
way to protect yourself and after you

374
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
donate blood because i want people to be

375
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
able to donate blood

376
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,680

377
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
people with a lot of symptoms donate

378
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
blood a lot of women

379
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,639
they feel like it's their duty and they

380
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,240
want to donate blood

381
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,160
and because men don't really donate

382
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,000
blood you know it's mostly women

383
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,920
that's who donates blood so the whole

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
planet is really women that are donating

385
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,680
blood but men aren't

386
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
so anyway just you know not as many it's

387
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
like you know so we got wit so here's

388
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,519
what's happening we got

389
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
with with donating blood we got women

390
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,040
that are struggling

391
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,760
with their health fatigue from low-grade

392
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,320
viruses

393
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,320
epstein-barr they got fibromyalgia

394
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
they're the ones donating blood

395
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,279
we got women that are actually

396
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,880
struggling with lyme disease they're

397
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,880
donating blood it's like

398
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
it's like something's wrong with the

399
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
system because

400
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
that's a risky area because now we're

401
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
losing our immune system by donating

402
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,600
blood while we're sick

403
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,519
and then i talk about how they take just

404
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
as much blood in a donation from

405
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,600
a female as they would a male so you got

406
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
a 250-pound male

407
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,760
they'll just take the same pint as

408
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
they'll take from a 90-pound woman

409
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,600
they don't even question it like hey

410
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,839
wait a minute she's 92 pounds

411
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,839
she's got fibromyalgia she doesn't feel

412
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
good let's just take a whole pint from

413
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,360
her

414
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,560
i mean the whole system's just arranged

415
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
i talk about it

416
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,839
i'm not saying you can't donate i want

417
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,199
people to donate blood i'm all

418
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,240
supportive of it

419
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,800
but but the system's not protecting

420
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,800
women that are sick when it comes down

421
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
to donating blood they don't say for a

422
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,680
whole week you should know

423
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,199
how to take your care of yourself and

424
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,000
get yourself ready for the blood

425
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,160
donation

426
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
and then after the blood blood donation

427
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,519
how to protect yourself

428
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,199
after the blood donation see so much

429
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
information in this episode i think you

430
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,160
guys

431
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
you guys have to see it so and then

432
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,000
you're gonna get there's a question i

433
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
hear out there a couple questions well

434
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
women bleed they have their cycle so you

435
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
mean to tell me what's going on with

436
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,480
that well that's a natural process of

437
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,639
life okay

438
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
that's a process of life that your

439
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,600
immune system

440
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,279
as a woman is ready for because 80

441
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,760
of your immune system goes to the

442
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,000
reproductive system during menstruation

443
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,440
the reason for that when you bleed

444
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,079
having a period

445
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,199
it's not even a fraction of the blood

446
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,519
they take or

447
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,120
draw with big blood draws that's a whole

448
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
nother thing all on its own

449
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
it's a smaller amount of blood with

450
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,199
tissue

451
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,240
shedding of the uterus lining

452
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,160
so it's not and then when a woman is in

453
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,519
in this serious condition where they're

454
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
bleeding too much with their periods

455
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,560
where they're

456
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,560
hemorrhaging it's devastating and

457
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,320
life-threatening

458
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,079
exactly that's why we have to worry

459
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,079
about blood draws that's why we have to

460
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,000
worry about taking so much blood from

461
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,680
women and some men too

462
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
well of course not with the menstruation

463
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,279
thing but you know with everything else

464
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,959
men don't go through that but for women

465
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,720
with the menstruation cycle

466
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,079
and the natural process that they go

467
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
through it

468
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,839
it's it's if they're hemorrhaging and

469
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,519
and too much bleeding

470
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,000
yes that's a major concern a lot of

471
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,440
women they get in trouble with that

472
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,199
but that's what i'm trying to say but no

473
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,240
one's saying when we take 39

474
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,480
vials from a woman like you know we take

475
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:43,199
39 vials from 104

476
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:47,120
pound um woman or 110 or 120 pound take

477
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,320
39 vials 35 vials 22 28 vials no one's

478
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,160
talking about that

479
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,160
that's different than a cycle it's

480
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,399
different than a natural cycle

481
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,199
or a normal cycle where there's a little

482
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,199
bit of blood

483
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,360
and then some lining some shedding of

484
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
the lining it's so it's really the whole

485
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,720
system is

486
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,399
all not where it should be it's the

487
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,279
information in this is mind-blowing

488
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,920
truly

489
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,199
um yeah one donation can save up to

490
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,279
three lives

491
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,199
with each each whole blood donation

492
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,639
absolutely regina and i believe in blood

493
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,399
donating

494
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,000
of course but look who's looking out for

495
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
the people donating blood

496
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
are they asking them questions are they

497
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
asking them the questions they

498
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
should ask them there's so many

499
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
variables are they looking to see if

500
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
they're

501
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,040
110 pounds and maybe

502
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
there should be a different way of

503
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
handling it are they looking at their

504
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,360
health history

505
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
really looking at it symptoms and

506
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,199
different things they're going through

507
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,120
are they looking at other exposures

508
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,000
they're having are they having stress in

509
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
their life

510
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,240
are they looking at that because i've

511
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
seen a lot of people donate blood

512
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
and get a lot sicker and sicker and then

513
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,320
they're bedridden because

514
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,199
they had conditions and symptoms they

515
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,240
weren't the same weight as a 250 pound

516
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,000
male who's six

517
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,759
foot five they were 125 pounds with a

518
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
little bit of fibromyalgia

519
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,959
some acne and some some psoriasis and

520
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
what happened was

521
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
they donated their pint and then they

522
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
were set backwards for months in their

523
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,199
healing and sometimes

524
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,720
actually in their healing throughout

525
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
their whole life so

526
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,240
you know dealing with their conditions

527
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
but i but yes

528
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439

529
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,760
but we want to protect ourselves

530
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
no one's saying when you donate blood

531
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,400

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
they're under 100 pounds

565
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,840
that's not true that's exactly that's

566
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
exactly one of the holes in the system

567
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,600
yeah that might be a

568
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
one place there are thousands of women

569
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,679
going into all kinds of blood donation

570
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,080
clinics

571
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,919
they walk in at 101 pounds they walk in

572
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,120
at 99 pounds they walk in

573
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,360
at 98.5 pounds and they leave blood

574
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,240
no one's watching no one's properly

575
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,480
keeping an

576
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
eye on them that's misinformation right

577
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,960
there sorry

578
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,760
misinformation debunked you know you

579
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,440
gotta get

580
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,520
if you if you know a lot you don't think

581
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,520
i've talked to dozens of nurses

582
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,640
you don't think i've actually done the

583
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
work myself

584
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,760
out there you don't think i've talked to

585
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
hundreds of doctors and hundreds of

586
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
doctors you don't think i know how blood

587
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,840
donations work

588
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,600
so yeah no one's no one's keeping an

589
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,280
eye on them no one's watching their

590
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,240
weight specifically

591
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
okay they're no one's watching all of

592
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
that their symptoms what they've gone

593
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,240
through

594
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,960
and look most importantly

595
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,679
this is also about your routine blood

596
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,039
tests

597
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,840
five aisles seven vials ten vials

598
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,720
can set you back greatly and it's not

599
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
it's not

600
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
being cared for you're not being cared

601
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,240
for

602
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,160
you're not being taught how to protect

603
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,880
yourself it's one of the most important

604
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
areas

605
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
and what happens with medical medium

606
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,559
information gets all these people better

607
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
and then they're all just getting blood

608
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,600
drained out of them every which way

609
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,520
and it's going against their healing

610
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,760
they're getting 14 vials drawn

611
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,880
seven vials drawn you guys got to hear

612
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,919

614
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,120

615
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
that let me see if i can get it back

616
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,360
down here

617
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,679
michaela i got about 40 vials taken from

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,440
me within a four to five month period

619
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
while being chronically ill

620
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,720
would i still be having issues from this

621
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
without knowing

622
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,799
i've been i have been following your

623
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
protocols for a month and a half yes you

624
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,520
could be

625
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
easily having issues i talked about it

626
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
in the episode you could be set back for

627
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
months in your healing three to six

628
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,960
months

629
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,480
just to get your 40 vials to get your

630
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,679
red blood cells back it could take three

631
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
to six months

632
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,039
to get them back to where they need to

633
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
be to get your white count back it could

634
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,600
be three to six months

635
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,320
to get him back and that's the problem

636
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,200
it's criminal it's actually criminal

637
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,039
that's what it is

638
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
