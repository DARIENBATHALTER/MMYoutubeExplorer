00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
at each other and yeah they shouldn't be

61
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
and they shouldn't be saying all these

62
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,320
terrible things or whatever they're

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,479

96
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,920
you guys vegan

97
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,840

98
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,200
no one really cares about them anymore

99
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
it's crazy right

100
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,879
no one cares it's i've seen that out

101
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
there too they've been phased out are

102
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,840
you

103
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,159
you macrobiotic like what are you right

104
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,879
and

105
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,640
it's all been phased out like it's crazy

106
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
how it works but it's true

107
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
really it's just animal protein it's

108
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
just keto or plant-based

109
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
or vegan right plant-based are vegan and

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,560
the vegans in the plant-based they

111
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
separated

112
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
so they separated like everybody wants

113
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
to belong i guess

114
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,599
in some place right they want this

115
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
belief system right

116
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
they want a belief system you know the

117
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
vegans are mad at the plant-based people

118
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
i didn't even go there

119
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
right but it's true because the

120
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
plant-based people are still wearing

121
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,720
leather

122
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
right they're still they're still

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
wearing leather shoes

124
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,159

125
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
going on too people like wait a minute

are you plant-based right we're totally

128
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,040

129
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,919
keto people they get all mad at the

140
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,240

start saying maybe you're on a standard

171
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
american diet and people like no i'm not

172
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,479

person nothing wrong with that if your

208
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
plant-based stay plant-based

209
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
if your animal protein staple animal

210
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
lunelle good to see it's so but but what

212
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
happens is we get wrapped up into the

213
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
battle

214
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,479
it's the battle right so i'm plant-based

215
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,199
i'm gonna follow all the plant-based

216
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
people right

217
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
i'm gonna follow the plant-based people

218
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,400
if i'm animal-based i'm gonna follow all

219
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,240
the animal-based people right

220
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,080
but everyone gets sick everyone gets

221
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,000
sick michelle l says we have to keep the

222
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
eye on the ball our eye on the ball

223
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
right

224
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,560
yeah um so we're vegan saying we cannot

225
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,680
be vegan because we consume

226
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
honey uh it is called healing

227
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
people right that's another thing too

228
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,000
with the honey yeah first of all

229
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,720
honey is vegan honey is plant-based

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
right

231
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
a bee is an insect really important to

232
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,319
know right there

233
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,520
a bee is not an animal so someone missed

234
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,520
the memo on that whole thing okay

235
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,520
so and and the b doesn't get hurt

236
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
so the b doesn't get hurt through that

237
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
process okay so that's important to know

238
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,319
right there

239
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,440
right and these bees have been here for

240
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,400
forever on this planet thousands of

241
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,759
years

242
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,120
right providing a source

243
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,080
for animals and humankind you know

244
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,599
but you know i if someone says well what

245
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,280
does anthony williams think

246
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
can you be vegan and still have honey

247
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
yeah i do i know that's gonna get people

248
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
mad

249
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
because then all of a sudden the vegans

250
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,720
are gonna be mad at me now oh he's he

251
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,759
doesn't know he's not

252
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,319
he's not woke on that whole thing like

253
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,160
aws not woke about that you know he's

254
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
off the mark and if he's off the mark on

255
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
the honey thing

256
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,400
i'm not gonna listen to anything the guy

257
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
has to talk about i'm not gonna listen

258
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,199
to anything meanwhile

259
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
you know they're doing medical medium

260
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,840
information tidbits that got into

261
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
all the different diet beliefs out there

262
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,520
right

263
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,919
that because the keto belief system is

264
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
now

265
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,080
surviving because it's it's adhering to

266
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,200
medical medium stuff that's how it's

267
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
even surviving

268
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,880
because in the old days you went keto

269
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,760
you got sick

270
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,839
real sick keto now was in keto by the

271
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
way i want to cover that for a second

272
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
before i make these potato wraps these

273
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,560
killer potato wrap salad wraps

274
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,920
um but keto is in keto anymore

275
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,959
that's it okay you eat a tomato

276
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,480
you eat a tomato okay on a keto diet you

277
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,399
can't go into ketosis

278
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,399
there's too much sugar in it there's

279
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,959
sugar in the tomato you there's glucose

280
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,600
in tomato you can't go into keto

281
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,240
you can't go into ketosis you can't go

282
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,720
your body

283
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,160
can't evolve to that process it can't

284
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,440
make that process happen

285
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,880
you eat an avocado as somebody on a keto

286
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,399
diet

287
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,000
and you can't go into ketosis it's not a

288
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,760
keto diet anymore

289
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
i mean when you really think about how

290
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
much confusion is in the diet world it's

291
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,000
unbelievable

292
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,800
minis are good to see it tonight you

293
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,800
know it's when you think about that

294
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,720
how does that work if you're eating an

295
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
avocado which is filled with sugar

296
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,720
should you guys know that you know that

297
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
avocado has glucose in it it's a fruit

298
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,640
it's not 100 fat fruit

299
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,320
avocados not it's got some sugar in it

300
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,560
it's got glucose in it

301
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,640
you can't go into ketosis so i'm on a

302
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,480
keto diet i'm doing my avocados no

303
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,360
you're not on a keto diet you're on

304
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
what people think is a keto diet but

305
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
it's not

306
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,640
it's not because it's got the sugar in

307
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,000
it i'm on a keto diet i'm doing

308
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,160
i'm doing uh almond butter there's sugar

309
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
in nuts and seeds

310
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,440
you can't go into ketosis because

311
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,600
there's sugar in nuts and seeds you guys

312
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,959
this is powerful information this is how

313
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,880
you empower yourself

314
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
by knowing where you're being tricked

321
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,640
weird

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,839
phantom world of misinformation but just

323
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
living by misinformation your whole life

324
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
i thought our lives are really important

325
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,959
where missing why would you want

326
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,360
to be stopped up and soaked with

327
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,480
misinformation your whole life

328
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,480
and not have the truth and the answers

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,640
isn't your life important don't you live

330
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,120
by your truth you live by your truth

331
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,399
right yeah but that's that's where they

332
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
trick you in alternative medicine

333
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,480
conventional medicine you get tricked

334
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,160
right because it's someone should just

335
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,240
all of a sudden be like uh

336
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,360
hey um everybody um it's not the keto

337
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
diet

338
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,079
it's just now a clean diet

339
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
you can be plant-based keto you can be

340
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,800
animal-based keto

341
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,279
but they're not keto the word doesn't

342
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,079
even apply anymore

343
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,160
that's how it works the only way to go

344
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,360
into ketosis

345
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,480
is literally just maybe doing animal

346
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,560
protein by itself and never

347
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:45,040
having any glucose no lemon no avocado

348
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,120
no tomato no starchy vegetable

349
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,440
not nothing right you just you're doing

350
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
just animal protein so you end up

351
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
and there's still glucose in meat but

352
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,360
you have a better

353
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
chance of heading into you know

354
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,519
ketogenic

355
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,839
state right you have a better chance of

356
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,240
of

357
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
reaching that keto ketogenic state right

358
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
especially if you're not eating a lot of

359
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,680
meat so

360
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
say you don't eat a lot of meat like say

361
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
you're a carnivore person

362
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,839
and you're not eating dairy and you're

363
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,040
not you're and you're just eating some

364
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
meat

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
you can go into ketosis if it's not a

366
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,839
lot of meat because if you're starting

367
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,639
to do a lot of meat there's sugar in the

368
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,959
blood

369
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
the blood of the animal their sugar it

370
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,920
caramelizes

371
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,160
it's in the it's in the meat it

372
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
caramelizes right so what happens is you

373
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
guys

374
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
when you eat a little bit of meat and

375
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
only a little bit of meat that's when

376
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,920
you go and take

377
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,200
you know into ketosis that's when you

378
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
can do it

379
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
but why doesn't anybody straighten out

380
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,279
all this misinformation

381
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,399
why is the world it's like the matrix or

382
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,079
something right

383
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
just everybody living this phantom

384
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,040
misinformation

385
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
place and nothing gets fixed and nothing

386
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
gets corrected

387
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
you can have all these fancy tv shows

388
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,200
you can have all this information on the

389
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
internet you can have all these articles

390
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,760
on the internet

391
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
you can have all these interviews all

392
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,040
these podcast doctors and nothing is

393
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,160
correct

394
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,480
nothing gets fixed it's almost like

395
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
it's it's yeah it's the matrix that's

396
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
what it is

397
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,440
in in natural health and conventional

398
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,959
health right

399
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,200
so um so paula torres says this is

400
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,160
nonsense i was vegetarian for 20 years

401
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
and it was

402
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,800
the worst thing for my body try am i

403
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,519
telling you to be vegetarian

404
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
i'm confused tried medical medium 2 it's

405
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,920
nonsense

406
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,440
at the bottom what affects everything is

407
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
genetics

408
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,680
read gene keys so okay so paula

409
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
so you just think our genes went all bad

410
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,680
in the last 20 years

411
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,320
our jeans went all bad in the last 25

412
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,279
years

413
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,800
so everything was going fine and now we

414
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,800
got the worst chronic illness ever

415
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
before in the history of humankind right

416
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,279
now

417
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,800
and i guess your genes all went bad in

418
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,240
the last 20 years so that's what you're

419
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,079
chalking it off to be

420
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,160
just so you know the whole it's your

421
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,000
genes comes from a theory that it's your

422
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,040
body attacking itself did you know that

423
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,040
like it's cause unknown do you know why

424
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,120
they came up with the word genes

425
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,519
do you know why the gene theory now

426
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,800
paula remember this it's called the gene

427
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,000
theory it's inconclusive

428
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,800
there's no facts there's no study that

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,120
proves it's your genes it's inconclusive

430
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
so

431
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,240
here you are already you're sitting here

432
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
you're

433
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
you're spouting out inconclusive stuff

434
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,320
like cause

435
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
unknown so they just say it's genes

436
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
right

437
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,920
but you might not be able to handle this

438
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
truth so paula

439
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
you might not be able to handle this

440
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
truth and i'm kind of wondering what mm

441
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
did you try

442
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,680
because there's a thousand different

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
protocols to customize for everybody's

444
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,560

that's chemical sensitive and there's a

505
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,039
different protocol for that

506
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,240

sick

518
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,160
were they mono eating because they have

519
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,440
all kinds of digestive problems and

520
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
chemical sensitivities

521
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
and food sensitivities were they mono

522
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,799

523
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,200
medical medium protocols right and did

524
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,280
they do the 369 cleanse over and over

525
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,039
again to get out of that place of health

526
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
so they can heal

527
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,039
and did they do 64 ounces of celery

528
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,120

529
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,880
like what where did they go and what

own detectives i really really got to a

570
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
point

571
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,400
in the la the last 30 years especially

572
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,000
with social media recently when someone

573
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,080
says i tried on them and it didn't work

574
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,120

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,760
did you use the stuff that was all

580
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,280
friendly instead of stuff that's toxic

581
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,039
right how long did you do it what also

582
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,600
what else are you doing and mixing in in

583
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,799

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799

it's just that if you want to go all the

597
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,200
way

598
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,760
don't throw mmm under the bus

599
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,280
because you didn't do your homework

600
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
don't throw a medical medium under the

601
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,919
bus

602
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
so that 10 other people say oh that

603
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
person tried mm i better not ever try it

604
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,760
so let me just stay sick the rest of my

605
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
life

606
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
because you'll send somebody else

607
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,919
packing and that person packing

608
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
up their belongings and going on the

609
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
road going on the road to musical chairs

610
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
and guessing games

611
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,320
you'll send them on that road for the

612
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
next five years

613
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
because they got thrown because they

614
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,480
believed

615
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,360
you were doing a real medical medium

616
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
protocol

617
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,640
doing it right doing it the way you

618
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,120
needed to do it

619
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
and then you just sent somebody on their

620
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,559
way

621
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,679
see you later alligator you've been sick

622
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,159
for another four five

623
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,080
six seven years before you learn what

624
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
viruses are causing your problems with

625
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
bacteria

626
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,159
causing your problems about the toxic

627
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,200
heavy metals about all the things to

628
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
avoid

629
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,960
and then you learn i should have been

630
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,320
doing the heavy metal detox smoothie

631
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
long enough i should have been doing the

632
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,440
celery juice a little bit long enough i

633
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,039
should have been doing spinach soups

634
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,480
i should have done the anti-radiation

635
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
tea i should have done the things that i

636
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
needed to do

637
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
i should have done use the right

638
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,520
ingredients and not

639
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,360
hpp i should have picked a celery juice

640
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,960
that was freshly juiced and not

641
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,799
high pressure pasteurization because you

642
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,480
can't get batter from that

643
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,200
right so i'm i'm just giving you the low

644
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,080
down

645
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,960
of how it works so i actually giving

646
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,720
good to see

647
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,120
i'm scratching my head when i hear that

648
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,760
one that's a funny one to me

649
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,480
so um you guys we're making food we

650
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,159
gotta do this

651
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,159
we're talking about plant-based versus

652
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,799
animal-based

653
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,799
this is a really incredibly important

654
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,600
topic because you can get wrapped

655
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,000
up in the belief systems and lose your

656
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,559
chance to heal

657
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,360
i believe in plant-based i believe in

658
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
vegan

659
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,760
i believe in animal protein if someone

660
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,400
wants to be on animal protein okay

661
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,159
because i've come i've come from a place

662
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,480
where spirit of compassion

663
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,960
has told me that it's not the person's

664
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,080
fault wherever they are spiritually

665
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,039
right

666
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,000
it's not the person's fault if they make

667
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,039
mistakes

668
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,480
right it's not the person's fault

669
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,000
of why they're even sick we have to not

670
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,480
pull the blame game on the person

671
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,480
we instead have to give the people the

672
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,000
tools and the truth

673
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
and then when they have that in their

674
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,440
hands they have a chance to heal and

675
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,919
move forward let's start making this

676
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:39,039
i'm excited you guys so

677
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,880
and basically it's about having a choice

678
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,960
i mean don't you guys want a choice

679
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480
it's about having a choice you want to

680
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,520
be able to

681
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,200
be able to make that choice to

682
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
make a decision so listen if you're

683
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,960
animal protein you got to do it right

684
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,400
to why you're sick if you're plant based

685
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,120
if you're vegan you've got to do it

686
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,799
right to why you're sick

687
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,480

is part of it it's a big part of it then

691
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,559
knowing what to do

692
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
the tools and how to do it is the other

693
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,159
part of it right

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,400
i'm going to give it a pulse

742
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,039
one thing that we have whether you're

743
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,240
vegan or your animal protein there's a

744
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,720
serious emotional attachment to food

745
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,159
we have emotional attachments to food

746
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,919
this is something we all

747
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,080

and the casino don't buy into that

799
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,200
that's a trick

800
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,520
to trick on social media too that's an

801
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,880
actual trick

802
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,159
that's to make someone that's to make

803
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,559
someone this is done that's

804
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,399
to make someone feel like they got

805
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,039
something over you

806
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,039
right you're out of control you're not

807
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,399
in control they're in control they're in

808
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,080
control of their emotions they're in

809
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,320
control of what they're eating

810
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,399
they're just living their life right you

811
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,159
know that's the vibe they put out right

812
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,000
you're the one that's a mess

813
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,919
you have to go to the health food store

814
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
you have to get the right food you got

815
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,679
to get the right everything

816
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,960
you're worried about your healing you're

817
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,559
worried about all this and

818
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
that's a game being played and you'll

819
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,919
play you'll see that out there

820
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,679
so you see some people they act like

821
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,600
they got it all together on youtube or

822
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,320
somewhere else and it's like this is how

823
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,320
this is what i eat and um and i really

824
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,159
don't care what i eat i just eat when i

825
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
feel like it and they pull that thing

826
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,320
and

827
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,559
that's a trick right there just letting

828
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,120
you guys know and it's a good trick too

829
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,399
because it can get you it can get you

830
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,799
believing that for some reason you're

831
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,120
you know you're the one that is like

832
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,360
worried about your food every minute

833
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,640
whether you're keto or your or your

834
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,200
plant-based

835
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,840
that's another trick that's happening

836
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,360
out there

837
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,440
so i'm gonna make a couple of these this

838
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,320
is like a batter right this is the maple

839
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,720
syrup

840
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,159
and the potato the steamed potato but i

841
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,880
gave it a blend

842
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
um and so i'm going to throw this in the

843
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,919
oven in a little bit but first i'm going

844
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,760
to prepare a couple of them

845
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,760
we've got lots to talk about while we're

846
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,720
doing this so

847
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,760
just bear with me let's get some of this

848
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
batter out

849
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,760
and the batter is just steamed potato so

850
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,399
we're not using a batter right

851
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,279
now why do i like recipes like this you

852
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,320
guys

853
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,600
because first of all there's no gluten

854
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,760
in here

855
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,960
right gluten feeds the bugs inside of us

856
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,640
you're sick

857
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,399
you're sick right and

858
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,000
if you're sick with anything there's

859
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,640
some buggies going on

860
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,240
there's some buggies at hand yep there's

861
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
some buggies at work

862
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,640
okay just giving you the 4-1-1 right

863
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,320
there if you're if you got a problem you

864
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
got a complaint you're at the doctor's

865
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,720
office

866
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,039
there's some buggies going on right

867
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,480
keep that in mind that's how it works

868
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,159
so first of all i'm just going to make

869
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,200
this tortilla right here

870
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,000
um let's see how that works here so what

871
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,000
i'm going to do is

872
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
i'm going to make a wrap and this wrap

873
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,000
is going to be

874
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,000
this wrap is going to be um

875
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,840
you got to keep the spoon kind of moist

876
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,919
so i'm going to just do this a little

877
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,240
bit and i'm making a potato

878
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,559
apparently potato pizza you can call it

879
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,840
a potato wrap you can call it a potato

880
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,960
pizza right

881
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,480
that's what i'm doing here and i'm just

882
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,080
gonna flatten this out a little bit

883
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,559
i'm going to try to get some shape to it

884
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,000
if i can

885
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,240
god willing there we go

886
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,679
kind of can shape it a little bit right

887
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,200
and then flatten it out more

888
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,480
you don't want it so thick

889
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,279
right you don't want it so thick but you

890
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,320
don't want it

891
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,960
so thin so there's this there's this you

892
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,000
know way you can have this right

893
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,840
i got the oven preset it's preheating

894
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,360
right now roughly around

895
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,360
400 i got a little lump right there

896
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,120
it's 200 celsius right

897
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,120
i think

898
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,360
all right there we go so this is one

899
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,399
wrap that's coming together nice

900
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,399
let's make another one

901
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,320
i want i don't want anybody left out of

902
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,320
the whole keto thing i wasn't ranking on

903
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,120
keto that's not what i'm doing i'm just

904
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,519
telling people you guys aren't on keto

905
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,679
you're not going into ketosis it's not

906
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
possible you guys got carbs in there and

907
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,200
you don't know it

908
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,480
but no one's fixing that like no one

909
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,600
corrects anything

910
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,120
right details matter and hey hey

911
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,039
maybe the details don't matter so much

912
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,039
if you're not sick

913
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,240
right maybe it doesn't matter so much

914
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,760
just live your life right

915
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,679
you're not sick but when you're sick

916
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,080
if you're sick those details mean

917
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:41,360
everything

918
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,519
that's make or break that's you're gonna

919
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,600
that's gonna be the point of like are

920
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,880
you gonna heal or not

921
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,919
do or die right

922
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,880
thrive or or not thrive

923
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,600
that's what matters the details make a

924
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,840
difference on

925
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,120
all of that think about that a little

926
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,320
bit right

927
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,840
every little bit counts when it comes

928
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,679
down to healing

929
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,200
so i'm going to add a little bit more

930
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,159

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,559
put a couple teaspoons of maple syrup in

933
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,240
here this is going to be really good

934
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,519
put a little garlic powder a little

935
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,519
onion powder in here right

936
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,039

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,320
ketos that's not it

938
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,679
i'm just letting you know it's not the

939
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,840
keto diet keto diet is

940
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,840
very little food uh-huh

941
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,480
and it has to be just meat and then you

942
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,799
go into a glucose deficit

943
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,600
and then you go into ketosis is that

944
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,519
good for you

945
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,640
horrible okay now carnivore

946
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,399

947
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,559
doesn't i'll tell you why

948
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,880
carnivore you're eating a lot of meat

949
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,919
you're also eating other things too

950
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,919
right but you're eating a lot of meat

proud of you the real keto diet of the

984

80s which i

985
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:30,639

lives

988
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,560
the keto diet you see now is not

989
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,079
keto it's just a clean animal protein

990
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,599
diet

991
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,200
right an ant clean animal protein diet

992
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,839
without the processed foods

993
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,919
but there still is carbohydrates it's in

994
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,919
the avocado it's in the nuts and seed

995
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,399
butters it's in the seeds the nuts

996
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,399
there's sugar in there there's sugar you

997
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,920
can't go into ketosis

998
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,839
you see how important this information

999
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,640
is but we walk around

1000
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,839
i mean you can you smart people don't

1001
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,800
know this

1002
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,359
doctors on magazine that talk about keto

1003
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,079
don't even know this

1004
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,720
think about this right like and they're

1005
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,560
smart

1006
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,960
people that's how tricky it all is smart

1007
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,960
people don't know this think about that

1008
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,560
um what they're really on it's just a

1009
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,240
clean animal protein diet and they got

1010
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,440
plenty of not plenty but they got

1011
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,160
some glucose enough glucose to stop the

1012
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,839
ketosis

1013
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,839
process ketosis p strips

1014
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:41,280
um i'm sorry but they just don't work

1015
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,079
no one can really detect truly what's

1016
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,839
coming out

1017
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,839
in our urine because we don't understand

1018
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,400
our detoxification processes we don't

1019
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,560
understand

1020
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
how our kidneys work we don't understand

1021
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,880
what's in our bloodstream how that works

1022
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,240
heck they can't even figure anything out

1023
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,040
with blood tests

1024
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,680
i mean we still don't have a real window

1025
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,359
into why

1026
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,800
first of all we don't have a window into

1027
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,960
why anybody's sick

1028
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
so all of a sudden what the ketosis p

1029
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,160
strip is going to have all

1030
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,400
it's going to be like think about that

1031
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,720
right nobody knows why everybody's sick

1032
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,320
nobody knows why 20 year olds are sick

1033
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,680
in bed a mattress island with fatigue

1034
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,359
nobody knows why people have eczema

1035
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,119
psoriasis nobody knows why anybody has

1036
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,839
debilitating depression anxiety

1037
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,040
but the ketosis p strips are just right

1038
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,640
on they're just

1039
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,160
they're infallible right they're just

1040
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,119
perfect right like

1041
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,920
we can't doubt a ketosis p strip god

1042
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
forbid

1043
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,400
even though no one knows why anyone is

1044
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,400
sick

1045
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,839
one thing about medical medium

1046
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,240
information is it makes

1047
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:43,040
sense and if you say well yeah of course

1048
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,000
you're going to say that you're the

1049
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
medical medium

1050
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,800
you're going to say it makes sense

1051
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,320
because you're the medical media nice

1052
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,800
try buddy that's what you're going to

1053
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,000
say to me like nice try anthony william

1054
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,440
it makes sense because you're the

1055
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,960
medical media well that's funny because

1056
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,160
i don't have this information it comes

1057
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,920
from above

1058
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,160
okay i had to learn it just like you

1059
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,359
guys i had to learn it just like you

1060
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,960
guys okay

1061
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,640
i'm making another one here this one's a

1062
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,000
little thicker so i might kind of remove

1063
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,520
some but i'm going to see where it goes

1064
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,119
as we go along

1065
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:16,000
um i might take some of it back

1066
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:18,160
right so this one's actually perfect

1067
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,440
because you don't want it to fall apart

1068
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,640
and tear

1069
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,560
and this one here is just a lot

1070
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
a lot thicker so we're gonna make one

1071
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,200
big one here which i'm actually

1072
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,960
kind of excited about that so

1073
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,960
yeah of course you're gonna think your

1074
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,079
information anthony

1075
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,520
is is perfect it makes sense because

1076
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,000
you're anthony and you're you're

1077
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,599
actually

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,520
talking about it's like well that's

1079
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,200
funny because i had a question spirit of

1080
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,000
compassion my whole life as a

1081
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,320
as as somebody who is learning because

1082
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,520
it's

1083
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,720
it's technically not my information

1084
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,920
it's from above right i'm the messenger

1085
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,880
right i'm the messenger it's no one

1086
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
else's information

1087
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
it's spirit of compassion's information

1088
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,839
right and then yeah

1089
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,599
of course i'm the one talking about it

1090
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,400
and putting it out there so yeah i guess

1091
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,680
it makes it

1092
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,520
medical medium information my

1093
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,359
information of course right and then

1094
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,079
science takes from it and they take what

1095
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,160
they want from

1096
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,240
it and they don't cite me and they and

1097
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,160
they plagiarize it which

1098
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,680
they are not allowed legally allowed to

1099
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,520
do that by the way

1100
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,800
but i still have this thing in me that

1101
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,480
wants people to learn

1102
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,200
so i don't like come down on

1103
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,320
on on that whole thing too hard but the

1104
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,119
point is is

1105
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,359
medical meme information published first

1106
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,280
you know is then taken and used other

1107
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,560
places without citing medical medium

1108
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,040
information so other people can find

1109
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,400
their way back and feel completely

1110
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,839
but either way it makes sense

1111
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,960
it just it's info that makes sense right

1112
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,760
now i know you guys are smart so

1113
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,119
when you learn this information you guys

1114
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,720
are like okay

1115
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,680
yeah well there is in order to hit

1116
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,000
ketosis

1117
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,280
you can't have sugars you can't have

1118
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,440
glucose or sugars

1119
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,040
nuts and seeds have a large percentage a

1120
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,359
large percentage of nuts and seeds

1121
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,560
they're sweet they actually have a

1122
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,200
sweetness to it peanut butter is sweet

1123
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,960
right there's a sweetness to these nuts

1124
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,839
and seeds and butters right there's also

1125
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,839
the fat too

1126
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,240
but there's a sweetness can't go into

1127
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,320
that ketosis with with all that there

1128
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,920
right but you can go in it if you're on

1129
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,480
a little piece of chicken

1130
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,520
right a little piece of meat you keep

1131
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,680
your calories down

1132
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,880
and that's all you eat each day and then

1133
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,800
guess what you're gonna hit that

1134
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,320
ketogenic state and guess what

1135
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,079
if you're somebody who's sick and not

1136
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,880
well or somebody who's not even

1137
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,960
sick you're gonna go downhill downhill

1138
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,079
downhill downhill because guess what

1139
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,280
your brain

1140
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,640
needs glucose it dies without it

1141
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,400
you guys on clubhouse i'm going to tell

1142
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,680
you right now without your without

1143
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
glucose in your brain

1144
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,000
in five seconds your brain starts to die

1145
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,680
your brain's made out of sugar

1146
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,280
now the reason why carnivore people can

1147
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,520
survive and

1148
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,599
i'll tell you why they survive because

1149
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
they're eating larger amounts of food

1150
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,160
they're eating larger

1151
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,160
larger amounts of meat and there's

1152
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,880
enough blood sugar in that animal's

1153
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,760
blood

1154
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,720
when it was killed to give them enough

1155
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,720
glucose to stop the ketosis process

1156
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,240
so even a carnivore person doesn't go

1157
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,599
into ketosis

1158
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,680
right and plus they're eating some

1159
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,680
cheese which is sugar it's lactose

1160
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,520
plus you're eating some other stuff too

1161
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,000
you know i mean and plus they

1162
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,119
they put in the chocolate with with some

1163
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,800
they bring in their sweet

1164
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,480
i can't tell you how many how many

1165
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
carnivore people are still having their

1166
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
chocolate bar

1167
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,119
and they got the cane sugar in the

1168
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,200
chocolate bar and you know they got

1169
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,760
you know i mean the whole bit all right

1170
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,160
guys i'm gonna throw this in the oven

1171
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,760

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,400

right so

1194
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,880
i'm not against i'm not against animal

1195
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,560
protein diets i'm not against eating

1196
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,480
animal protein if you want to do that

1197
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,760
i just want to help you do it right i

1198
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,119
want to make sure you can have it in

1199
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,680
your life if that's what you want and

1200
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,240
still

1201
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,160
heal so mm info is about making sure

1202
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,560
whether you're animal or plant-based

1203
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,319
which side of the aisle are you on it it

1204
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,240
still means you can heal

1205
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,160
but you need the tools to heal and

1206
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,319
that's why the animal protein people and

1207
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,560
the keto people and everybody else like

1208
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,520
eating clean diets they still get sick

1209
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,440
they're still sick

1210
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,760
and they're still in the dentist chairs

1211
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,319
the the plant-based people the vegan

1212
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,280
people

1213
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,119
still get sick but the thing is i feel

1214
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,920
bad about the plant-based people

1215
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,680
the minute they get sick they are

1216
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,640
running

1217
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,280
running for the eggs running for the

1218
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
eggs

1219
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,200
they get scared their doctor tells them

1220
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,560
they need their protein you shouldn't

1221
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,520
have been vegan you shouldn't have been

1222
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,319
plant-based

1223
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,040
and you go running for not everyone but

1224
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,760
you run

1225
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,480
for the eggs it's why the plant-based

1226
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,040
people

1227
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,720
never really attacked the eggs they

1228
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,119
never hit the eggs hard they kept them

1229
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,760
like

1230
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,960
coveted eggs are coveted by everybody on

medical medium is the only is the only

1233
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
place where it was

1234
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,720
like you know the eggs are bad the eggs

1235
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,319
are bad all these years going like 30

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,839
medical medium eggs are bad right what

1238
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,760
happens is

1239
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,839
man the plant-based people they kind of

1240
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,520
keep that like a dark secret

1241
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,599
i'm not making fun of them i get it it's

1242
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,720
a comfort food you keep it as a dark

1243
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,160
secret you always know

1244
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,440
somewhere somehow you can always fall

1245
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,280
back on those eggs

1246
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,280
you see your family members eating eggs

1247
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,520
you see your friends eating eggs

1248
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,359
see your friends get drunk at a party

1249
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,760
and now they're in a diner eating eggs

1250
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,599
right

1251
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
at two o'clock in the morning you see

1252
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,920
everybody eating eggs

1253
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,599

right the whole bit

1257
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,960
but if you want to heal you got to take

1258
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,640
out the eggs with the plant-based people

1259
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,560
man they get sick they run for the eggs

1260
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,359

harping on anybody right and then the

1273
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,599

but i got this thing where the chains of

1305
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,800
the chronically ill like the chains

1306
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:12,480
of chronic illness the chains that

1307
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,480
keep people down right and sick right

1308
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,960

so when you're sick and you can't get

1310
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,400
out of it

1311
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:22,319
there's a way there's a way you might

1312
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,359
have to let go of your eggs

1313
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,359
but there's a way okay you might have to

1314
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,359
let go of the butter but there's a way

1315
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,640
you might have to let go of the cacao

1316
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,760
but there's a way

1317
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,960
the caffeine you might have to let

1318
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,800
something go but you know what

1319
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,400
spirit of compassion is going to make

1320
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,240
sure you're able to eat more things than

1321
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,280
you ever could imagine

1322
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,960
more so than the other diet belief

1323
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,960
systems believe it or not

1324
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,200
because they're all anti-fruit pretty

1325
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,040
much and if the plant-based ones aren't

1326
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,359
it came from medical medium

1327
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,960
because they always were going all the

1328
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,319

1366
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,000
soul seeker that's a whole thing it's

1367
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,000
like the other diet belief systems all

1368
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,440
through the years were anti-tomato i got

1369
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
these beautiful tomatoes in front of me

1370
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,160
isn't this like

1371
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,599
it's saying look at these tomatoes so

1372
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,119
many other belief systems

1373
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,440
right were anti-onions and anti-garlic

1374
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,040
right if you like onions garlic you can

1375
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,200
have them okay

1376
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,359
right so all the different a lot of

1377
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,920
other belief systems were anti-sprouts

1378
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,760
you got

1379
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,480
all the different sprouts a lot of other

1380
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,319
belief systems were anti-potatoes

1381
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,160
and you got all the potatoes you want

1382
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,480
including anti-sweet potatoes out there

1383
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,960
too

1384
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,079
sweet potatoes right and then people

1385
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,640
didn't know about

1386
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,280
winter squash and how awesome that is

1387
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,680
too

1388
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,640
and then the melons everybody feared the

1389
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,119
melons

1390
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,559
watermelon honeydew melon people didn't

1391
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,839
even know they could even eat a honeydew

1392
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,079
melon right

1393
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,440
and so it's all the different things

1394
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,880
that we can eat

1395
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,880
and the figs and the apples

1396
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,559
i heard for years you guys from doctors

1397
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,599
that would contact me over the years and

1398
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,559
they would say

1399
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,760
did you tell my patient that they can

1400
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:22,960
have

1401
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,520
apples i said yeah and not the green

1402
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,440
apple

1403
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,599
i'm like what do you mean not the green

1404
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,040
apple and be like yeah the green apple

1405
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,240
they're only my patients are only

1406
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,400
allowed green apples

1407
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,160
it's like why because apples have too

1408
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,200
much sugar it's fruit

1409
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,040
so it's only green apple and i'm like

1410
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,640
okay well it's your patient that's what

1411
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,920
you can do but then don't don't send

1412
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,760
your patients to me

1413
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,040
because i'm gonna actually you know make

1414
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,520
sure they can have

1415
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,079
other things too and it's like it's like

1416
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,640
like

1417
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,920
real apples not just the green granny

1418
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,839
smith apple

1419
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,599
that you can't taste really any kind of

1420
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,240
sugar or any kind of glucose

1421
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,760
and people don't realize your brain dies

1422
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,720
without the glucose

1423
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,240
and if you don't keep the fats down low

1424
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,559
you can't get sugar

1425
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:11,440
to your brain cacao is high in fat

1426
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,359
and caffeine right so two things are

1427
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,040
wrong right there the caffeine damages

1428
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,760
your adrenals

1429
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,800
and the fat keeps glucose from going to

1430
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,720
your brain

1431
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,559
so then you get addicted because the

1432
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,760
fats blocking everything so that's what

1433
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,800
happens with chocolate you're eating

1434
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,680
your chocolate

1435
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,119
and you're eating your cookies and stuff

1436
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,119
and you get addicted

1437
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,319
you get addicted to that fat here's what

1438
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,200
it is it's like

1439
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,880
the sugar's not getting to your brain

1440
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,280
because the fats blocking it it's called

1441
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,359
insulin resistance everybody gets it

1442
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,359
you have a chocolate bar then that

1443
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:46,000
chocolate bar has honey in it or

1444
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,440
or raw sugar or something right you know

1445
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,720
like honey and raw sugar which is

1446
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,119
which is fine right but then any kind of

1447
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,119
sugar in your diet or any kind of sugar

1448
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,400
in your chocolate like whatever it is

1449
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,280
you can't get

1450
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,359
the sugar to your brain um you seem fine

1451
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,079
to me chris says pizza has more sugar

1452
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,119

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,200
you just lost 10 varieties of grapes

1659
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,280
that's another you just

1660
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,240
no cucumbers no onions look look what

1661
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,079

you're staying away from everything

1672
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,960
okay so um the point i'm making is

1673
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,000
medical medium information is about more

1674
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,359
foods than anybody really knows but then

1675
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,200
when someone says

1676
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,880
stay away from those nightshades

1677
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,839
whatever diet you guys have been on or

1678
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,359
tried right

1679
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,960
somebody says stay away from those night

1680
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,079
shades okay

1681
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,760
now your peppers all gone can't do any

1682
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,760
peppers no bell peppers no

1683
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,680
you know no red bell peppers orange

1684
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,520
these are ripe peppers

1685
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,440
ripe peppers red bell peppers orange

1686
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,240
bell peppers yellow bell peppers

1687
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,119
gone eggplant's gone right stay away

1688
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,079
from those nightshades

1689
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,280
nope no the tomatoes all the the variety

1690
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,680
of tomatoes

1691
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,880
alone easy ten varieties of tomatoes you

1692
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,200
can get in the stores

1693
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,240
gone so guess what we just lost 100

1694
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,599
foods

1695
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,559
we lost 100 foods um i'm we're losing 10

1696
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,839
foods at a time

1697
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,079
with all the different diet belief

1698
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:05,440
systems 10 foods at a time

1699
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,720
think about that checking these pizza

1700
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,839
crusts because they're cooking they're

1701
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,960
looking good

1702
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,799
they're good they're they're they're

1703
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,400
getting some air pockets in them they're

1704
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,680
in the oven they're baking you guys in

1705
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,799
clubhouse we're making

1706
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,960
you know i don't know if you can see it

1707
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:18,400
but you know if you look on youtube or

1708
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,079
facebook right now

1709
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,280
youtube's probably where to go facebook

1710
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,640
they're just censoring and kicking

1711
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,400
everybody off right

1712
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,160
i'm not against animal protein if that's

1713
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,799
what you guys want in your diet

1714
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,880
i'm not but look how many foods there

1715
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,000
are so you can actually lower your

1716
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,400
animal proteins a little

1717
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,040
bit because your animal proteins are

1718
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,160
animal

1719
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:41,520
fat that's the fact

1720
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,440
fat stops us from healing you fat

1721
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,119
yourself to death it stops you from

1722
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,000
healing we're fatting ourselves to death

1723
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,920
we're a society

1724
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,359
that's fattening ourselves to death and

1725
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,880
alter the alternative medicine

1726
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:51,920
conventional medicine is all about high

1727
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,400
fat right now

1728
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,400
complete talking about the matrix again

1729
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,960
we're back in the matrix again

1730
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,119
it's misinformation everybody hops on

1731
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,359
the trend train

1732
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,160
and now everybody thinks it's good to

1733
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:06,799
just just

1734
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,520
bombard your system with fats kill when

1735
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,720
you don't know it

1736
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,559
you're killing your gallbladder you're

1737
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,400
killing your liver when you've got that

1738
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,079
gallbladder that wants to explode down

1739
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,760
the road or you got that liver

1740
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,359
that just wants to get sick down the

1741
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,000
road you don't know

1742
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,559
all that trendy information led you

1743
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,480
there

1744
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,760
it was it was one of those things that

1745
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,599
led you there

1746
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,440
and people are fatting themselves to

1747
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,079
death and that's what they're doing

1748
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,319
um okay so i got thinly sliced cucumbers

1749
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,359
here thinly sliced tomatoes here

1750
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:39,599
this is really coming out good okay

1751
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,599
so um it's moving some of these out

1752
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,079
what i like about if you want to do some

1753
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,960
animal protein do it at the end of the

1754
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,480
day

1755
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,880
right don't do it in the middle of the

1756
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,799
day don't do the breakfast morning time

1757
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,079
and the whole intermittent fasting thing

1758
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,920
that came about

1759
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,160
has helped people to some degree it's

1760
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,720
still not perfect at all on any level

1761
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,599
because

1762
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,440
when you intermittent fast you still you

1763
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,200
still don't get the things you need so

1764
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,119
you'll age you'll still age

1765
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,400
quickly down the road right because

1766
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,160
you're living off adrenaline and

1767
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,040
adrenaline ages us

1768
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,760
it ages us all that adrenaline so if we

1769
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,000
stay

1770
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,839
on the intermittent fasting train we're

1771
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,119
eventually just going to get dried up

1772
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,720
down the road we're going to just our

1773
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,160
adrenaline is going to dry us

1774
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,240
up we're going to be a plant that

1775
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:24,400
eventually gets dried up

1776
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,599
and then you know and we age quick and

1777
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,799
the wrinkles come

1778
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,119
and everything else but yeah

1779
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,319
intermittent fasting actually helps

1780
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,760
people temporarily

1781
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,839
because it's giving them energy because

1782
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,799
they're not doing steak and eggs in the

1783
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,640
morning anymore

1784
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,240
they're not doing bacon in the morning

1785
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,680
they're not doing all that nut butter in

1786
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,400
the morning they're not doing the fats

1787
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,720
in the morning

1788
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,000
they're not doing all that nut butter

1789
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,520
and cheese in the morning

1790
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,799
cheese and eggs they're not doing all

1791
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,319
their eggs in the morning because when

1792
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,920
you intermittent fast doesn't mean they

1793
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,359
don't eat that at the end of the day

1794
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,040
but when you intermittent fast you're

1795
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,200
giving your liver a break

1796
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,799
that's how it works and you're get

1797
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,319
you're giving yourself a break you're

1798
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,359
giving your liver a break when you

1799
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,359
intermittent fast

1800
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,039
right this is still cooking up it's

1801
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,599
coming around i still want to get a

1802
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,319
little bit more toastier

1803
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,240
so serena says that food makes you sick

1804
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:13,520
what about the fact you were already

1805
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
sick well we're eating fats our whole

1806
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,799
life

1807
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,400
that's what's going on we eat fats our

1808
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:19,680
whole life we're taught to just be on

1809
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,480
fats our whole life

1810
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,079
right our kids are eating hot dogs right

1811
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,799
our kids are eating chicken or kids are

1812
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,960
eating

1813
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:28,319
peanut butter right it's not just about

1814
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,599
animal protein it's plant

1815
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:33,599
fat too okay so oils

1816
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,880
all of it fried food or kids are eating

1817
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:38,400
fried food

1818
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,799
so what no kids ever have fried food no

1819
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,599
no kids ever had hot dogs no kids ever

1820
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:43,920
had

1821
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,599
chicken fingers no kids ever had any of

1822
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:49,839
that kind of thing right

1823
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,839
you know and um

1824
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:55,440
but what it is not just that and i know

1825
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,680
that i'm heading there it's not just

1826
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,680
that

1827
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:03,200
it's like it's like

1828
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,799
it's it's not just like our children

1829
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,280
eating the chicken fingers and the

1830
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,720
little

1831
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:11,599
you know buffalo chicken wings right and

1832
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,319
you know the hot dogs okay it's we're

1833
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,119
trained

1834
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:16,319
we're raised on fat and we're trained to

1835
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,319
be on fat right

1836
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:20,319
but it's not just this you can do this

1837
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,880
and still not get sick for a while

1838
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,839
but you end up getting a pathogen or you

1839
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,839
end up getting

1840
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,039
which everybody has in the end they'll

1841
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,160
have their epsine bars they'll have

1842
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,480
their streptococcus

1843
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,520
and it's those pathogens that get away

1844
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,920
from us

1845
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,640
because we keep on bombarding ourselves

1846
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,119
with cheese

1847
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,760
and butter and we're dropping our immune

1848
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,079
system with

1849
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,839
all that fat and that's how it works and

1850
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,280
then we're eating eggs and that feeds

1851
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,720
the pathogens it's all important

1852
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,319
information

1853
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,319
i think these are just about ready here

1854
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
i don't know maybe a couple more minutes

1855
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:59,839
actually and we're good

1856
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:01,839
so um

1857
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:04,880
but the bottom line is you can be you

1858
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:07,280
can be look you can still heal

1859
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,799
and but it's about having those tools

1860
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,079
lowering the fats is really a good way

1861
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:11,359
to heal if you're sick

1862
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,200
bringing them down a little bit so if

1863
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,920
you're doing animal protein do it at the

1864
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,000
end of the day

1865
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,440
don't do a lot of it maybe do it every

1866
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,599
other day but get ready for this if

1867
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,160
you're vegan or plant-based you guys

1868
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,000
right do the avocado at the end of the

1869
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,280
day and do it every other day

1870
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,480
right just bring in some steamed

1871
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:30,559
potatoes okay bring in papaya bananas do

1872
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,319
the smoothies bring in steamed potatoes

1873
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,680
do the leafy greens keep the leafy

1874
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,440
greens going in there

1875
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,960
all of that do the spinach and leafy

1876
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,440
greens do more fruit

1877
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,280
and then keep your fats try to stay away

1878
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,000
from the cacao and all the nut butters

1879
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,760
and everything

1880
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,280
look i know this information is annoying

1881
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,839
in some way but

1882
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,280
it's not annoying when you're sick

1883
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,920
what's more annoying

1884
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,200
is it just being sick all the different

1885
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:55,200
aches and pains and

1886
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,640
tingles and numbness and exorisis and

1887
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,319
acne and

1888
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,000
you're sluggish and you're just and

1889
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,680
you're fatigued and

1890
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,559
you're just you're hitting the doctor's

1891
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,000
office you've got the functional

1892
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:05,520
medicine doctor now your chinese

1893
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,280
medicine doctor and you're

1894
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,720
now you're at the dentist and now you're

1895
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,520
back at the doctors and you're you know

1896
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,640
back to functional

1897
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,559
now you're back at your conventional

1898
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,240
doctor and and

1899
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,680
what's more annoying is it that or

1900
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,640
having tools to actually

1901
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,039
be able to rise out of that okay and

1902
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,599
grains can be okay for people if they're

1903
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,960
not dealing with pathogens and

1904
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,680
other things or if they're not super

1905
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,680
sick and fats can be okay for people if

1906
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,240
they're not super sick with pathogens

1907
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,599
right

1908
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,200
but when everybody's sick and they're

1909
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,319
getting all the symptoms then we've got

1910
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,760
something we need to do

1911
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:39,039
we need to do something all right these

1912
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,039
are done i'm going to pull them out

1913
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,880
so i'm going to do that now

1914
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,839
and

1915
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,760
this thing is really really hot so i'm

1916
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,359
just letting you guys know

1917
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,240
so i'm going to kind of pop this right

1918
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,240
here okay

1919
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,400
there we go i'm going to move this over

1920
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,760
let me get these tomatoes out of the way

1921
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,640
you guys are okay with that

1922
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:25,760
all right i'm gonna move them out all

1923
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:30,720
right

1924
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:33,920
and so i got these pizza crusts

1925
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:36,480
you guys seeing i mean

1926
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,480
these are really awesome they really are

1927
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,520
i'm gonna actually take this knife

1928
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,039
and cut this one right here they

1929
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:44,839
probably could have been in the oven a

1930
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:49,359
little bit longer

1931
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:49,359
but look at that peels right off

1932
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,640
i needed the oven probably a touch more

1933
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
and

1934
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,680
but i'm going to let them cool a little

1935
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,319
bit that's really going to help so let's

1936
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,319
let them cool

1937
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,319
and then we're almost there we're about

1938
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,680
to plate this up and get it to get it

1939
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,160
going

1940
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:22,559
so i look at it this way every time

1941
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,760
a doctor contacted me over the years and

1942
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,359
said

1943
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,200
i have a patient dealing with a lot of

1944
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,480
mystery symptoms they got the tingles

1945
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,440

you know look um can you work with

1970
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:19,440
someone if they're eating animal protein

1971
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,640
like yeah of course um can you work with

1972
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,279
someone if they're

1973
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,480
vegan or want to be vegan or plant-based

1974
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,239
yeah of course

1975
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,239
it's like how's that possible like how

1976
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,199
is that possible i don't get it

1977
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,400
how right how is that possible and it's

1978
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,560
possible because

1979
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,759
of knowing why someone's sick and either

1980
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,719
side doesn't know

1981
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,400
and that's why the vegans are

1982
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,920
plant-based people get sick you guys and

1983
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,679
that's why the animal protein people

1984
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,640
keto people whatever you want to call it

1985
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,600
get sick because they all do and then

1986
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,520
they flip flop

1987
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,279
and it's like flip-flop back flip-flop

1988
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,000

on that journey of a guessing game

2005
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:22,560
and and this is

2006
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,839
important because that guessing game

01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,159
journey can wear you

01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,760
and they're gonna leave plant-based

2024
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,000
they're gonna leave the plant-based

2025
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,719
movement they're gonna get sick down the

2026
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,760
road

2027
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,280
good to see you emcee uh mc says people

2028
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,320
are looking because you're in pain good

2029
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,679
to see you tonight

2030
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:18,480
so um i read your comments a lot

2031
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:21,040
austin good to see you tonight right the

2032
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,400
deal is you have to learn what's wrong

2033
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:26,080
you have to learn why you are sick

2034
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,400
that's the deal and then when you learn

2035
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:31,840
that you know that plant-based

2036
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,719
keto isn't the answer to heal high-fat

2037
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,920
vegan and high-fat plant-based will keep

2038
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,719
you sick

2039
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,920
if you're sick enough if you haven't

2040
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,440
gone there yet

2041
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,040
if you haven't gone to that place of

2042
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,520
being sick enough yet

2043
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,320
then you can probably do okay on that

2044
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,520
plant-based

2045
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:53,199
keto that plant-based high-fat right

2046
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:56,640
you can do okay long enough right

2047
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:58,320
but if you do get sick or you do

2048
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,000
get to a place where things are starting

2049
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,040
to fall apart and happen it's because

2050
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,360
the fats aren't

2051
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:05,040
allowing the body to heal with what's

2052
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,640
behind the problem which is

2053
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,640
the pathogens the epstein bar the

2054
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,320
shingles the cytomegalovirus you know

2055
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,760
most people walking around they got all

2056
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,960
these bugs in them they'll have two

2057
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,880
varieties of shingles

2058
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,159
three varieties of streptococcus two

2059
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,719
varieties of epstein-barr

2060
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:19,840
and they'll have that inside them and

2061
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:21,120
that's how it works

2062
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,840
so i'm letting this cool down it's

2063
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,840
starting to come out

2064
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,360
it's peeling it back a little bit more

2065
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,360
from the paper from parchment paper

2066
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,840
all right

2067
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,320
still cooling down a little bit so

2068
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,640
there you go but

2069
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,679
i like making meals that are fat free

2070
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,360
because i know

2071
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,360
everybody's gonna eat the fat i can't

2072
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,280
stop you i can't stop anybody

2073
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,360
they're just gonna do it i got friends

2074
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,920
where like i'll teach them how to heal

2075
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:58,239
you know and then they're still having

2076
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,480
their vegan pizza or something else

2077
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,000
and that's what they'll do elena said i

2078
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,000
had ocd

2079
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,600
and after medical medium protocol i

2080
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,320
don't really have it anymore

2081
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,440
and i had it for four years that's

2082
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,560
incredible

2083
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,960
i remember i put an ocd post out and i

2084
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:18,239
got slammed

2085
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:20,480
slammed by the ocd community

2086
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,600
and they were all upset that there was

2087
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,360
an answer

2088
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,880
they were mad that there was an answer

2089
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,560
toxic heavy metals

2090
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:32,080
and they were angry that there was

2091
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:33,920
an answer you know the ocd community

2092
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,280
it was like they were just it was

2093
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,640
unbelievable what happened and i'm like

2094
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,000
wait a minute are you really suffering

2095
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,440
from ocd because if you're really

2096
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,560
suffering from ocd you're going to want

2097
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:41,440
an answer and you're going to want to

2098
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,800

calmed after my most recent 28-day

2150
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,120
cleanse that

2151
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,199
that just wrapped up a few days ago for

2152
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,159
the first time i'm actually

2153
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:48,800
preferring my food without avocado

2154
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:50,800
incredible

2155
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,600
and i want you guys to know it's not

2156
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:56,800
that i'm anti-fats

2157
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,760
it's reducing them getting some control

2158
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,120
over them

2159
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,920
is critical to healing it really is

2160
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:05,679
and if you can bring down that avocado

2161
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,000
yeah you can do some healing

2162
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,280
how special is that it's not because

2163
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,159
avocados bad

2164
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:14,080
it's just that we got bad stuff in us we

2165
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:15,679
got bad things in us that are causing

2166
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,040
our sickness and problems look at this

2167
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,560
i'm putting these cucumber slices in

2168
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:22,080
there this is amazing

2169
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,600
and you in order to for your body to go

2170
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,199
after a pathogen you guys

2171
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,520
you can't have your blood filled with

2172
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:30,400
fat if your blood is filled with fat

2173
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,840
you can't your body's immune system gets

2174
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,679
tangled up in the fat

2175
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,360
so it can't go after your epstein bar it

2176
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,000
can't go after your shingles it can't go

2177
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,840
after

streptococcus to go after streptococcus

2183
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,159
you can't do it by eating a steak dinner

2184
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,840
and you can't do it by eating a nut

2185
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,360
butter dinner
