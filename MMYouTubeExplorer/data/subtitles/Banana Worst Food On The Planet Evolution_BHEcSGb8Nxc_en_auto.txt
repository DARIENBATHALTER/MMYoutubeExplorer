[584.56 - 589.12] this is cool instagram another fantastic
[586.80 - 590.88] podcast the ending was very intriguing
[589.12 - 592.96] i'm wondering if you are going to give
[590.88 - 594.48] us some more insights into some of this
[592.96 - 597.04] in your next podcast
[594.48 - 599.76] after the hint you gave us about it in
[597.04 - 601.12] the last week's ig live thank you spared
[599.76 - 602.88] the most high
[601.12 - 606.16] medical medium and the whole medical
[602.88 - 607.84] medium team bless your heart
[606.16 - 610.24] i'm working on
[607.84 - 612.32] an alien podcast episode i'm just
[610.24 - 614.40] letting you guys know okay
[612.32 - 616.08] i don't know what's going to happen
[614.40 - 617.44] when it's released
[616.08 - 619.28] i think i'm going to lose a lot of
[617.44 - 620.40] followers
[619.28 - 621.92] probably
[620.40 - 624.72] because
[621.92 - 626.96] alien podcast that i'm going to put out
[624.72 - 629.12] is not like the usual crap
[626.96 - 631.84] not like usual stuff where government
[629.12 - 634.64] bases are harboring aliens
[631.84 - 636.00] area 51 it's not going to be that usual
[634.64 - 637.12] crap right
[636.00 - 638.56] so
[637.12 - 639.92] i'm not saying that's true or false or
[638.56 - 641.44] anything i'm not saying that i'm just
[639.92 - 642.40] saying it's not going to be the usual
[641.44 - 644.56] thing
[642.40 - 646.16] so the alien podcast that i'm putting
[644.56 - 647.76] out
[646.16 - 651.20] it's going to have some shocking stuff
[647.76 - 653.68] in there right but it it may shock
[651.20 - 655.20] people a little too much and i'm not
[653.68 - 656.96] sure which direction they're going to be
[655.20 - 658.80] shocked
[656.96 - 660.48] i mean you'll probably just
[658.80 - 662.40] lose thousands of followers because of
[660.48 - 664.24] it but you know what
[662.40 - 665.36] i'm always at risk of that any time any
[664.24 - 666.80] time i go against the apple cider
[665.36 - 668.48] vinegar people every time i go against
[666.80 - 670.16] ionizer people every time i go against
[668.48 - 671.36] chocolate people whatever i
[670.16 - 673.36] lose every time i go against the
[671.36 - 675.12] psilocybin people i just lose people
[673.36 - 677.12] anyways nothing i can do
[675.12 - 679.84] the glam rose says
[677.12 - 680.96] as fruit and smoothies cause cavities in
[679.84 - 682.68] children

[682.68 - 688.80] unbelievable the glamorous please listen
[685.60 - 690.08] on youtube please listen i beg of you

[714.72 - 718.40] is it the only thing you have a
[716.08 - 720.40] histamine reaction to that's it like
[718.40 - 722.40] there's an actual reaction right when
[720.40 - 724.72] you have the banana so that's something
[722.40 - 726.32] to consider too right or
[724.72 - 728.08] just you're told you have histamine
[726.32 - 729.28] elevations because of bananas and stuff
[728.08 - 731.44] like that i know that alternative
[729.28 - 733.76] medicine is teaching people to be afraid
[731.44 - 735.92] of banana they'll tell you anything
[733.76 - 737.28] about the banana right so i'm just
[735.92 - 739.20] curious that's the only thing that
[737.28 - 740.64] elevates your histamine on any level or
[739.20 - 742.08] is it foods you had the night before
[740.64 - 743.84] that are elevating the histamines and
[742.08 - 746.08] the bananas or just going in there to
[743.84 - 748.32] try to clean things up so there's a lot
[746.08 - 750.32] of different ways of looking at it
[748.32 - 752.40] people get really toxic and they start
[750.32 - 754.88] reacting to everything i'm reacting to
[752.40 - 756.80] bananas now now i'm reacting to apples
[754.88 - 759.04] now i'm reacting to strawberries now i'm
[756.80 - 761.04] reacting to grapes now i'm reacting to a
[759.04 - 762.72] melon now i'm reacting to a papaya now
[761.04 - 764.48] reacting to a mango i thought mango
[762.72 - 766.40] would be okay now i'm reacting now i'm
[764.48 - 768.32] reacting to some mel cilantro man i'm
[766.40 - 770.00] reacting to cilantro and that's what i'm
[768.32 - 772.00] reacting to it's what happens is when
[770.00 - 774.40] you get really toxic you just start
[772.00 - 775.76] reacting all kinds of stuff
[774.40 - 777.44] so
[775.76 - 779.68] yeah so why does everybody have to
[777.44 - 782.24] defend the banana how bad does it get
[779.68 - 784.24] because i told you in the podcast
[782.24 - 786.40] there's some evil seeds planted
[784.24 - 787.76] purposely into the alternative movements
[786.40 - 789.92] of functional medicine doctors and
[787.76 - 792.88] podcast doctors right
[789.92 - 794.64] and all the doctors rip bananas down and
[792.88 - 796.96] they rip them down and they rip them
[794.64 - 799.12] down to the point where they just want
[796.96 - 801.36] you to eat the green banana where it's
[799.12 - 803.68] totally green a hundred percent that's
[801.36 - 806.56] what they want they want it to be like
[803.68 - 808.80] green and only green the sugars are not
[806.56 - 809.76] good for you and they just want it green
[808.80 - 812.32] right
[809.76 - 815.36] i might have a doctor friend show up
[812.32 - 817.52] so we'll see maybe in a little bit
[815.36 - 818.72] all right
[817.52 - 820.56] so
[818.72 - 822.48] let's talk about
[820.56 - 824.80] right here okay
[822.48 - 826.48] breastfeeding if moms are trying to
[824.80 - 829.12] develop enough milk
[826.48 - 831.92] to breastfeed their babies bananas are a
[829.12 - 835.12] big one right there and not just one not
[831.92 - 837.92] just a half a banana but if a mom
[835.12 - 839.52] is worried about breast milk and wants a
[837.92 - 841.28] full tank
[839.52 - 844.48] a breast milk
[841.28 - 847.44] right to go the distance
[844.48 - 849.84] then it's critical to be doing bananas
[847.44 - 852.24] bananas are critical for that and not
[849.84 - 854.64] just one banana once in a while not just
[852.24 - 856.40] a banana every other day
[854.64 - 858.64] talking about making sure you're doing
[856.40 - 860.72] some bananas six seven bananas eight
[858.64 - 862.64] bananas a day you want breast milk
[860.72 - 865.20] because bananas really crank up the
[862.64 - 867.04] breast milk is what they do they crank
[865.20 - 869.84] the breast milk up so there's a full
[867.04 - 872.08] tank for the baby critical to know right
[869.84 - 872.88] there
[872.08 - 875.04] see
[872.88 - 877.52] jay from youtube says please let me know
[875.04 - 880.48] what to do i get real tired after eating
[877.52 - 882.56] bananas alone nothing else so what
[880.48 - 883.84] happens is like this right
[882.56 - 885.84] if you're really tired when you eat
[883.84 - 888.08] banana first of all you'd never get
[885.84 - 890.48] tired eating nothing else nothing else
[888.08 - 893.76] makes you tired so that's important to
[890.48 - 896.88] know right there so a mango
[893.76 - 899.28] watermelon a chicken dinner
[896.88 - 901.52] piece of cheese an egg nothing makes you
[899.28 - 902.96] tired just a banana so that that's
[901.52 - 904.08] important so i want you to be your own
[902.96 - 905.84] detective
[904.08 - 907.20] i want you to be your own
[905.84 - 909.44] detective
[907.20 - 911.76] it's critical you gotta ask yourself
[909.44 - 914.08] what else is making me tired when i eat
[911.76 - 915.68] nothing else makes me tired nothing
[914.08 - 918.00] nothing at all
[915.68 - 919.52] not that pasta meal that that won't make
[918.00 - 920.80] me tired at all
[919.52 - 922.88] not that
[920.80 - 924.40] that cookie that will make me tired well
[922.88 - 925.84] if the cookies you know jacket with
[924.40 - 927.28] caffeine and chocolate chips it's
[925.84 - 929.04] definitely gonna not make people tired
[927.28 - 930.96] right but
[929.04 - 933.76] it's important to know
[930.96 - 935.28] like is it just the banana so you have
[933.76 - 937.12] to be your own detective you have to
[935.28 - 940.72] really look at that because it can trick
[937.12 - 942.40] you out right there so okay so if
[940.72 - 944.72] someone has
[942.40 - 948.00] neurotransmitter problems
[944.72 - 949.60] if they have neurological issues right
[948.00 - 951.04] vagus nerve issues they don't know about
[949.60 - 952.72] neurotransmitter problems they don't
[951.04 - 954.40] know about lots of toxic heavy metals in
[952.72 - 958.48] the brain they don't know about right
[954.40 - 960.56] and you eat a banana you do get relaxed
[958.48 - 963.60] you can get relaxed so yeah it's
[960.56 - 964.72] possible the banana is may calming your
[963.60 - 966.24] nerves
[964.72 - 968.48] if your nerves are sensitive and
[966.24 - 972.00] problematic a banana can give you a
[968.48 - 974.80] temporarily nerve calming effect
[972.00 - 977.76] which is incredible really very healing
[974.80 - 980.32] it could be that kind of tired
[977.76 - 982.16] versus some other kind of tired right
[980.32 - 983.60] but also look at all your other foods
[982.16 - 986.00] and what you're doing does anything make
[983.60 - 988.00] you tired at all but because if nothing
[986.00 - 990.00] makes you tired and a banana makes you
[988.00 - 992.68] tired then that's a healing
[990.00 - 994.64] tryptophan healing effect
[992.68 - 997.84] neurotransmitter glucose
[994.64 - 999.92] neurotransmitter chemicals getting to
[997.84 - 1001.68] those neurotransmitter chemicals like
[999.92 - 1003.84] you know that's the whole point all of
[1001.68 - 1006.24] it very healing electrical impulses
[1003.84 - 1007.68] neurons getting boom
[1006.24 - 1009.04] all that glucose
[1007.68 - 1011.68] trace minerals and neurotransmitter
[1009.04 - 1015.20] chemical compounds doctors say we should
[1011.68 - 1017.36] eat high fat low sugar diets for pcos
[1015.20 - 1018.80] doctors know everything about pcos
[1017.36 - 1020.96] that's why they're stopping all that
[1018.80 - 1022.56] pcos out there huh
[1020.96 - 1024.56] that's why they're able to fix all that
[1022.56 - 1027.12] pcos out there
[1024.56 - 1029.68] they know so much about pcos out there
[1027.12 - 1032.24] that's why nobody has pcos anymore you
[1029.68 - 1034.40] didn't hear about that there's no pcos
[1032.24 - 1037.52] anymore it doesn't exist anymore because
[1034.40 - 1039.04] the world of doctors cured it so pcos
[1037.52 - 1040.72] isn't even out there anymore because
[1039.04 - 1042.88] doctors are so smart and science
[1040.72 - 1046.16] researchers so smart that they actually
[1042.88 - 1046.96] eradicated pcos from this planet
[1046.16 - 1048.64] so
[1046.96 - 1050.56] did you did you know that did you guys
[1048.64 - 1053.28] know that pcos doesn't exist anymore
[1050.56 - 1056.88] they actually found a magic pill
[1053.28 - 1058.72] the doctors found a magic pill for pcos
[1056.88 - 1060.16] and it eliminated it all across the
[1058.72 - 1062.32] planet there's not one woman dealing
[1060.16 - 1063.84] with pcos anymore they eradicated it
[1062.32 - 1066.40] because research and science are so
[1063.84 - 1068.16] smart yeah they know everything so you
[1066.40 - 1070.08] better listen to them when they say go
[1068.16 - 1071.92] on a keto diet and don't have any sugar
[1070.08 - 1075.92] for your pcos because they're so smart
[1071.92 - 1077.76] they eradicated all pcos on the planet
[1075.92 - 1080.76] you guys i think i had too many bananas
[1077.76 - 1080.76] today
[1081.20 - 1085.20] all right

[1093.76 - 1099.04] let's see hot is on youtube
[1096.32 - 1101.12] okay me kk maybe the problem is not the
[1099.04 - 1102.88] banana but the pesticides i have this
[1101.12 - 1104.80] problem with melons but the organic
[1102.88 - 1106.64] version is no problem at all it's
[1104.80 - 1108.72] incredible maybe you're really really
[1106.64 - 1110.56] highly sensitive and maybe it's not even
[1108.72 - 1112.72] the pesticide but even something else
[1110.56 - 1115.04] christina says i eat four to six bananas
[1112.72 - 1116.88] a day just don't mix them with fat
[1115.04 - 1119.92] christina
[1116.88 - 1123.28] amazing amazing don't mix them with fat
[1119.92 - 1125.84] no you don't have to janet kaiser i
[1123.28 - 1128.00] found eating one banana a day caused my
[1125.84 - 1130.00] blood sugar to jump almost 70 points

[1130.00 - 1133.68] we're going to talk about right now
[1132.08 - 1134.84] let's go there
[1133.68 - 1137.36] you
[1134.84 - 1139.36] ready that's because your diet is high
[1137.36 - 1143.04] in fat you may not know it but it's high

[1179.04 - 1184.40] coconut coconut coconut butter coconut
[1181.92 - 1186.72] oil coconut flakes
[1184.40 - 1188.48] all of the fat
[1186.72 - 1191.44] right
[1188.48 - 1193.60] makes it so anytime you put any kind of
[1191.44 - 1196.24] healthy sugar in you or any kind of
[1193.60 - 1199.44] sugar in you your insulin resistance
[1196.24 - 1201.44] kicks in because you got so much fat
[1199.44 - 1204.00] pumping through your bloodstream that
[1201.44 - 1206.64] your insulin resistance happens it's not
[1204.00 - 1210.48] the banana's fault the banana's there to
[1206.64 - 1212.48] help heal you and fix you
[1210.48 - 1215.68] that's what that is
[1212.48 - 1218.56] but if we're gonna eat all this fat
[1215.68 - 1222.96] every day chocolate nut butters nuts
[1218.56 - 1224.64] seeds oils avocado chicken meat eggs
[1222.96 - 1226.88] dairy
[1224.64 - 1228.24] nut milks if we're gonna eat all that
[1226.88 - 1230.48] fat
[1228.24 - 1232.56] what's gonna what's gonna happen oh you
[1230.48 - 1234.72] gotta dump in there's a little sugar no
[1232.56 - 1236.96] matter what it is
[1234.72 - 1238.48] little glucose go in boom insulin
[1236.96 - 1240.24] resistance reason why is because your
[1238.48 - 1242.08] liver is tanked out you've already
[1240.24 - 1244.48] tanked out your liver it's already got a
[1242.08 - 1246.88] fatty liver you're already pre-diabetic
[1244.48 - 1251.60] you're already pre-diabetic you're
[1246.88 - 1251.60] already getting that insulin resistance
[1251.92 - 1254.40] this is what you this is what happens
[1253.28 - 1256.24] when you eat a lot of bananas you get a
[1254.40 - 1257.68] lot of energy it's crazy and i was up at

[1391.28 - 1394.80] and that liver is sick and that lit
[1392.88 - 1396.96] liver is clogged up and you got liver
[1394.80 - 1398.88] problems then it's clogged up you've got
[1396.96 - 1401.04] the fatty liver and everything and you
[1398.88 - 1402.88] go off the fats and you learn how to eat
[1401.04 - 1405.52] the foods you need to eat right like the
[1402.88 - 1408.88] banana when you're off the fats then
[1405.52 - 1411.60] your liver comes back
[1408.88 - 1414.56] which is a big deal
[1411.60 - 1416.48] any pregnant mamas out there something
[1414.56 - 1419.92] to know bananas really healthy for
[1416.48 - 1421.76] developing babies inside the womb
[1419.92 - 1424.08] critical too
[1421.76 - 1426.00] listen to the podcast on how to eat the
[1424.08 - 1428.80] banana a lot of people eat them under
[1426.00 - 1431.68] ripe or over ripe and it can cause
[1428.80 - 1433.36] problems okay so
[1431.68 - 1435.60] you know that's important to know right
[1433.36 - 1435.60] there
[1436.32 - 1440.08] does it matter organic or not
[1438.56 - 1441.84] honestly if you can't get an organic
[1440.08 - 1443.36] banana i would get a conventional banana
[1441.84 - 1445.84] that's what i would do
[1443.36 - 1447.28] i would go and buy conventional bananas
[1445.84 - 1450.72] darn right
[1447.28 - 1453.04] yeah i mean totally would do that 100
[1450.72 - 1456.32] if that's all i had and i do do that a
[1453.04 - 1458.16] lot conventional bananas a lot of times
[1456.32 - 1459.60] this might be a round of conventional
[1458.16 - 1461.28] bananas right here if i couldn't find
[1459.60 - 1462.96] they were getting
[1461.28 - 1465.28] elizabeth
[1462.96 - 1467.52] i used to help with liz i used to limit
[1465.28 - 1471.36] my bananas now i can eat four to seven
[1467.52 - 1472.96] at a time that's incredible liz
[1471.36 - 1476.24] liz you're always blowing my mind anyway
[1472.96 - 1477.84] and just that's amazing that's amazing
[1476.24 - 1479.68] incredible tara appleman had two
[1477.84 - 1481.12] perfectly ripe bananas this morning oh
[1479.68 - 1484.00] my god
[1481.12 - 1485.76] so proud of you that's amazing
[1484.00 - 1489.04] incredible

[1512.48 - 1517.04] just came on here medical mean podcast i
[1514.72 - 1518.48] just released banana the worst food on
[1517.04 - 1521.60] the planet
[1518.48 - 1523.52] the worst food on the planet
[1521.60 - 1525.12] david david witchin man integrity
[1523.52 - 1526.08] generation just wanted to shout out to
[1525.12 - 1527.52] you brother
[1526.08 - 1529.68] because you
[1527.52 - 1532.00] made me laugh my
[1529.68 - 1535.28] ass off the other day
[1532.00 - 1536.88] i gotta say and uma you really really
[1535.28 - 1537.92] kicked it into gear
[1536.88 - 1539.52] and
[1537.92 - 1542.00] umakali
[1539.52 - 1543.76] i'm just saying you guys made me laugh
[1542.00 - 1545.76] like and i needed that laugh that
[1543.76 - 1548.08] actually really was a good good timing
[1545.76 - 1549.04] for me when i saw that
[1548.08 - 1551.04] right
[1549.04 - 1553.20] david you actually imitated
[1551.04 - 1554.32] the podcast doctor better than i
[1553.20 - 1557.20] actually do
[1554.32 - 1559.36] way better so anyway
[1557.20 - 1560.48] you know you guys ever think about this
[1559.36 - 1561.76] all right
[1560.48 - 1563.92] think about this
[1561.76 - 1566.16] hey david whitson thank you uma made the
[1563.92 - 1566.16] edit
[1566.56 - 1570.48] yeah
[1567.52 - 1572.24] i'm gonna watch it again later
[1570.48 - 1574.48] i watched it 10 times
[1572.24 - 1576.00] david i actually watched it 10 times
[1574.48 - 1578.08] i did
[1576.00 - 1579.84] and um i watched it 10 times
[1578.08 - 1580.88] maybe even more i watched it over and
[1579.84 - 1583.20] over again
[1580.88 - 1584.80] i was laughing at heart
[1583.20 - 1587.04] right
[1584.80 - 1587.04] so
[1587.28 - 1590.80] you know
[1588.64 - 1592.40] evolution right so you guys let's just
[1590.80 - 1594.24] have a little like i don't know let's
[1592.40 - 1596.96] just have like
[1594.24 - 1599.44] private talk for a second right
[1596.96 - 1600.88] the whole evolution thing okay
[1599.44 - 1601.84] a lot of people believe in evolution
[1600.88 - 1603.68] right
[1601.84 - 1607.28] they believe that we were like
[1603.68 - 1608.80] in it you know we that we were a snail
[1607.28 - 1610.88] and then
[1608.80 - 1614.32] from from a snail we turned into some
[1610.88 - 1615.44] kind of like other crustacean right
[1614.32 - 1616.96] and then
[1615.44 - 1619.84] we went from there and then we turned
[1616.96 - 1621.68] into like a minnow
[1619.84 - 1622.96] and then we turned into a squid and then
[1621.68 - 1625.04] we turned into
[1622.96 - 1627.44] a jellyfish and then we
[1625.04 - 1628.24] somehow were able
[1627.44 - 1630.48] to
[1628.24 - 1631.44] start breathing in oxygen
[1630.48 - 1633.44] right
[1631.44 - 1636.56] and we somehow turned into another
[1633.44 - 1638.88] creature inside the ocean right
[1636.56 - 1641.60] and then when when then from there we
[1638.88 - 1642.80] maybe we turned even into a mammal
[1641.60 - 1644.16] in the ocean
[1642.80 - 1646.48] i don't know
[1644.16 - 1648.08] turned into a whale but somehow we ended
[1646.48 - 1650.64] up because the evolution science of
[1648.08 - 1653.20] research right science research
[1650.64 - 1654.48] right they're so smart you know
[1653.20 - 1656.24] you can't mess with science research
[1654.48 - 1658.40] they know everything they know why
[1656.24 - 1659.84] everybody's sick
[1658.40 - 1660.96] that's why you know
[1659.84 - 1662.56] everybody's
[1660.96 - 1664.56] poaching medical medium information of
[1662.56 - 1666.16] why everybody's sick right now they're
[1664.56 - 1668.32] actually poaching it
[1666.16 - 1669.84] anyway signs of research so science
[1668.32 - 1672.00] research is so smart right next thing
[1669.84 - 1674.96] you know we got on land right and we
[1672.00 - 1677.04] started crawling on land right and our
[1674.96 - 1678.96] gills opened up right
[1677.04 - 1680.48] so another whatever a thousand years and
[1678.96 - 1682.72] we've been our gills started breathing
[1680.48 - 1684.72] in and then we developed lungs
[1682.72 - 1687.04] right
[1684.72 - 1689.84] and then now we're on the we're we're
[1687.04 - 1691.28] then we became something else on the
[1689.84 - 1692.88] right
[1691.28 - 1694.72] now we're like
[1692.88 - 1696.64] i don't know not a squirrel whatever
[1694.72 - 1698.24] like a hedgehog or something
[1696.64 - 1701.04] and then we became a bear and then we
[1698.24 - 1703.84] became a monkey somehow right
[1701.04 - 1705.92] because you guys know evolution right
[1703.84 - 1707.44] science research is so smart they teach
[1705.92 - 1710.80] that in schools
[1707.44 - 1713.44] right so now now we're a monkey
[1710.80 - 1715.68] somehow and then as a monkey we somehow
[1713.44 - 1716.48] became like a gorilla
[1715.68 - 1719.44] right
[1716.48 - 1722.88] and then when we became a gorilla
[1719.44 - 1724.88] we somehow became a human
[1722.88 - 1726.48] i don't know how
[1724.88 - 1728.48] they don't know how with their theory of
[1726.48 - 1729.68] evolution they teach it as if it's
[1728.48 - 1730.96] factual
[1729.68 - 1732.64] anyway
[1730.96 - 1734.48] right we became
[1732.64 - 1737.04] a gorilla right
[1734.48 - 1738.88] and it's kind of funny
[1737.04 - 1741.28] we became a monkey or a gorilla the
[1738.88 - 1743.12] monkey never became a gorilla
[1741.28 - 1745.20] so i'm kind of confused about that one
[1743.12 - 1746.96] just get just a private talk between us
[1745.20 - 1748.48] okay
[1746.96 - 1749.92] right
[1748.48 - 1750.96] i'll probably get canceled for talking
[1749.92 - 1752.88] about this stuff really because you're
[1750.96 - 1756.16] not supposed to even talk about like
[1752.88 - 1758.16] evolution right anyway so so
[1756.16 - 1760.56] okay did the monkey ever turn into a
[1758.16 - 1762.24] gorilla no the monkey's like a dick
[1760.56 - 1764.32] right different species or something
[1762.24 - 1766.48] gorilla's different either way
[1764.32 - 1768.08] we somehow came from that
[1766.48 - 1770.32] okay
[1768.08 - 1773.44] here's here's the craziest part why are
[1770.32 - 1774.80] there all these monkeys left over
[1773.44 - 1776.16] friend of mine was in costa rica and
[1774.80 - 1777.84] there's a like bunch of monkeys down
[1776.16 - 1780.40] there it's like
[1777.84 - 1781.28] why are they still there
[1780.40 - 1783.36] like
[1781.28 - 1785.52] has science figured out like why they
[1783.36 - 1787.84] just they just aren't developing they're
[1785.52 - 1789.92] just not turning into humans eventually
[1787.84 - 1791.68] over time like have the science figured
[1789.92 - 1793.76] that out right no they haven't
[1791.68 - 1796.80] so anyway let's just go into this anyway
[1793.76 - 1796.80] monkeys eat bananas
[1797.60 - 1802.32] monkeys eat bananas now we care about
[1800.80 - 1804.56] primates right
[1802.32 - 1806.32] i'm pretty sure the human race cares
[1804.56 - 1808.88] about primates right gorillas eat
[1806.32 - 1810.40] bananas too right so we're supposed to
[1808.88 - 1812.24] care about
[1810.40 - 1813.84] right nature
[1812.24 - 1815.68] right i saw a commercial the other day
[1813.84 - 1817.68] there was a guy like saw a commercial
[1815.68 - 1819.52] there was a guy like in a car so i don't
[1817.68 - 1821.44] know if it was a car commercial and he
[1819.52 - 1823.60] had this like grater on the back like he
[1821.44 - 1824.72] had a rake on the back of the car and it
[1823.60 - 1827.12] was like this
[1824.72 - 1828.96] this hippie dude guy right
[1827.12 - 1830.80] which is cool he looked cool
[1828.96 - 1832.80] so he was in this like
[1830.80 - 1834.08] million dollar car
[1832.80 - 1836.16] on the beach
[1834.08 - 1838.72] guy had like some long hair or whatever
[1836.16 - 1840.88] he was in this like car whatever
[1838.72 - 1842.72] and he was cruising on the beach and he
[1840.88 - 1845.84] had this rake stuck on the back of the
[1842.72 - 1848.40] car and the rake was picking up like
[1845.84 - 1849.76] like bottles and stuff he was driving
[1848.40 - 1851.60] real fast
[1849.76 - 1853.20] the guy was wearing designer clothes
[1851.60 - 1855.44] right so you know they're one of those
[1853.20 - 1857.36] guys they got a little longish hair
[1855.44 - 1859.60] totally decked out with really expensive
[1857.36 - 1861.04] shoes really expensive clothes to the
[1859.60 - 1861.76] tilt you know one of those kinds of guys
[1861.04 - 1863.28] right
[1861.76 - 1864.80] i'm not judging them or anything i'm
[1863.28 - 1866.32] just telling you i'm giving you the
[1864.80 - 1869.68] description
[1866.32 - 1871.44] so so he's obviously an educated guy
[1869.68 - 1873.84] got lots of money came from money or
[1871.44 - 1876.08] something and he's in his fancy car and
[1873.84 - 1877.84] he's on the beach driving right and he's
[1876.08 - 1879.60] raking up with the rake on the back of
[1877.84 - 1882.08] the car you guys saw this and he's
[1879.60 - 1884.16] raking up like bottles empty bottles
[1882.08 - 1886.08] plastic bottles and he's raking them up
[1884.16 - 1887.92] and he's dragging him along and then
[1886.08 - 1891.60] after that they show him sitting there
[1887.92 - 1894.08] like relaxing like yeah man
[1891.60 - 1896.32] i'm like really really
[1894.08 - 1897.36] i really hip on taking care of nature
[1896.32 - 1899.12] and stuff
[1897.36 - 1900.48] and then all these sea turtles were just
[1899.12 - 1902.72] everywhere of course they did come you
[1900.48 - 1904.16] know computer images of the sea turtles
[1902.72 - 1906.00] coming up like there's thousands of sea
[1904.16 - 1906.72] turtles coming up to lay their eggs
[1906.00 - 1909.20] right
[1906.72 - 1910.72] and this guy's like proud of himself and
[1909.20 - 1913.20] i don't blame him because he got some
[1910.72 - 1914.16] plastic bottles off the beach
[1913.20 - 1916.96] right
[1914.16 - 1919.36] which is so we're like all about caring
[1916.96 - 1922.96] for nature caring about our world caring
[1919.36 - 1924.72] about our oceans caring about like ray
[1922.96 - 1926.56] reptiles
[1924.72 - 1929.28] caring about everything right that's
[1926.56 - 1932.96] what we're about we're all about that
[1929.28 - 1934.48] right then why the hell
[1932.96 - 1937.36] on earth
[1934.48 - 1939.28] is all this now food science guys all
[1937.36 - 1941.04] the doctors
[1939.28 - 1943.52] all the podcast doctors all the
[1941.04 - 1947.12] functional medicine doctors
[1943.52 - 1949.28] all the food science people
[1947.12 - 1951.60] basically telling us we're [ __ ] if we
[1949.28 - 1953.12] eat bananas
[1951.60 - 1954.96] when they're feeding the bananas to the
[1953.12 - 1956.88] monkeys because it's their natural food
[1954.96 - 1958.56] oh it's fine for the monkey i thought we
[1956.88 - 1960.32] cared about the monkey but apparently we
[1958.56 - 1961.68] don't give a [ __ ] about the monkeys and
[1960.32 - 1963.20] we don't give a [ __ ] about the gorillas
[1961.68 - 1964.88] and the chimps because they're eating
[1963.20 - 1966.24] crappy bananas and they're just gonna
[1964.88 - 1968.56] die and have liver disease for the
[1966.24 - 1970.56] bananas we shouldn't stop or intervene
[1968.56 - 1972.48] that on any level we should just let
[1970.56 - 1974.56] those monkeys just eat as many bananas
[1972.48 - 1976.16] as they want that [ __ ] crap food that no
[1974.56 - 1978.40] one's supposed to eat because functional
[1976.16 - 1980.64] medicine doctors and podcast doctors and
[1978.40 - 1982.00] all the scientists sure know better they
[1980.64 - 1983.84] know we shouldn't be eating this because
[1982.00 - 1985.28] this is going to kill us this is bad for
[1983.84 - 1987.84] us right
[1985.28 - 1989.68] this is terrible if we start eating this
[1987.84 - 1991.44] but make sure the monkeys are eating it
[1989.68 - 1994.24] though they can eat it the gorillas can
[1991.44 - 1997.12] eat it and everything else and heck if
[1994.24 - 1998.72] they if we are in this evolution stage
[1997.12 - 2001.52] those monkeys and grills are eventually
[1998.72 - 2003.52] going to turn to humans so why the hell
[2001.52 - 2006.24] are we feeding these monkeys and
[2003.52 - 2007.76] gorillas all the bananas
[2006.24 - 2009.52] well we know they're going to turn into
[2007.76 - 2011.60] humans eventually
[2009.52 - 2014.00] and then we're just genetically screwing
[2011.60 - 2016.00] them up
[2014.00 - 2017.28] how's that how's that make any sense to
[2016.00 - 2020.24] you guys
[2017.28 - 2022.00] so we care about life here in planet
[2020.24 - 2024.16] earth hell there's commercials of like a
[2022.00 - 2027.04] rich hippie dude in a fancy car with
[2024.16 - 2029.12] decked out designer hippie cool clothes
[2027.04 - 2031.68] or whatever regular clothes or long hair
[2029.12 - 2033.44] nothing wrong with that pull in a car
[2031.68 - 2036.08] with this stuff raking up plastic
[2033.44 - 2038.16] bottles like he's like totally on it
[2036.08 - 2041.68] sitting down relaxing all cool ready to
[2038.16 - 2041.68] crack open a corona light
[2042.40 - 2047.60] and then you know and then you know
[2045.20 - 2049.84] turtles are coming up if we care that
[2047.60 - 2052.00] much like we're supposed to care then
[2049.84 - 2052.80] why the hell are we leaving
[2052.00 - 2054.72] like
[2052.80 - 2056.08] the monkeys and the gorillas behind
[2054.72 - 2057.60] because they're going to be human
[2056.08 - 2059.04] someday because science research tells
[2057.60 - 2061.60] us those monkeys and girls are going to
[2059.04 - 2062.80] be humans there's no question about it
[2061.60 - 2064.64] there's no doubt because science
[2062.80 - 2066.48] research is always right
[2064.64 - 2068.64] they're always right about everything so
[2066.48 - 2070.24] we have to trust science and research
[2068.64 - 2071.92] because those monkeys and chimps and
[2070.24 - 2074.48] those and those gorillas they're going
[2071.92 - 2076.64] to be 100 a human being they're still in
[2074.48 - 2078.40] the evolution phase so why the hell are
[2076.64 - 2079.76] we doing what science research and food
[2078.40 - 2081.44] science and podcast doctors and
[2079.76 - 2083.52] functional medicine doctors are telling
[2081.44 - 2085.20] us not to do is we're letting all those
[2083.52 - 2086.64] gorillas and monkeys eat all those
[2085.20 - 2088.64] bananas
[2086.64 - 2092.72] and we're supposed to avoid them because
[2088.64 - 2092.72] it's so damn bad for us
[2094.16 - 2101.88] can you answer that for me
[2096.96 - 2101.88] cause i'm scratching my head over here
[2102.80 - 2106.72] anyway
[2104.56 - 2107.84] you guys got to check out the podcast
[2106.72 - 2109.68] episode
[2107.84 - 2110.64] because it's cool
[2109.68 - 2112.48] you know
[2110.64 - 2115.36] it's a good one it's filled in for
[2112.48 - 2116.92] information it's packed bananas are good
[2115.36 - 2119.28] for the brain
[2116.92 - 2121.92] neurotransmitters they're good for your
[2119.28 - 2122.96] like your organs your hearts is critical
[2121.92 - 2124.48] okay
[2122.96 - 2127.12] and
[2124.48 - 2128.72] i'm not an evolution fan so i look you
[2127.12 - 2131.44] can believe in what you want to believe
[2128.72 - 2133.04] in i don't believe in evolution
[2131.44 - 2134.00] i'm just saying
[2133.04 - 2136.64] but
[2134.00 - 2139.68] if if you believe in evolution i support
[2136.64 - 2140.96] you 100 i don't judge i don't judge what
[2139.68 - 2142.32] you do
[2140.96 - 2145.76] okay
[2142.32 - 2148.08] right i'm just not a big evolution fan
[2145.76 - 2149.68] i think it was purposely kind of put out
[2148.08 - 2152.80] there to take people away from the
[2149.68 - 2154.88] spiritual aspect of life
[2152.80 - 2157.84] is what i believe it was i believe it
[2154.88 - 2160.96] was designed to take you away from the
[2157.84 - 2163.12] thought that we are spiritual beings and
[2160.96 - 2165.68] that spiritual
[2163.12 - 2168.56] connection up above
[2165.68 - 2170.88] matters and is real and the light up
[2168.56 - 2174.64] above matters and is real and i believe
[2170.88 - 2175.76] evolution this is my opinion
[2174.64 - 2178.48] was set
[2175.76 - 2180.40] there in stone and taught in schools and
[2178.48 - 2182.08] everything else to take you away from
[2180.40 - 2184.24] god the creator the light whatever you
[2182.08 - 2187.04] believe in up there the universe take
[2184.24 - 2189.36] you away from that to make you think
[2187.04 - 2191.68] that you're not you have no connection
[2189.36 - 2193.84] up there whatsoever you're just
[2191.68 - 2196.08] you were a toad
[2193.84 - 2198.08] and you went from a toad to something
[2196.08 - 2199.84] else a snail or whatever you went from a
[2198.08 - 2201.44] snail to something else and then finally
[2199.84 - 2203.04] you became a monkey
[2201.44 - 2205.52] and yeah we just left all the other
[2203.04 - 2207.84] monkeys behind if that's the case don't
[2205.52 - 2210.00] feed them bananas anymore man because if
[2207.84 - 2211.84] it's killing us these bananas why are
[2210.00 - 2213.44] you giving it to them or letting them
[2211.84 - 2215.60] eat bananas out there they should chop
[2213.44 - 2218.32] down every banana tree in the
[2215.60 - 2219.92] in the amazon
[2218.32 - 2222.16] besides the reason you should chop every
[2219.92 - 2223.60] single banana tree down and not let
[2222.16 - 2225.68] those monkeys and grills ever get a
[2223.60 - 2229.24] banana ever since they're so darn bad
[2225.68 - 2229.24] for all of us
[2230.64 - 2234.40] anyway
[2231.76 - 2236.24] which i hope they don't do
[2234.40 - 2238.48] but yeah bananas are that good for us
[2236.24 - 2240.32] and good for monkeys and gorillas too
[2238.48 - 2241.76] they are indeed
[2240.32 - 2243.52] okay let's talk about ripeness for a
[2241.76 - 2244.80] little a couple of seconds two way i got
[2243.52 - 2246.56] you guys
[2244.80 - 2249.28] addie case's celery juice and banana
[2246.56 - 2253.52] cleanse has caused more bloating yet all
[2249.28 - 2256.48] of my ms symptoms have been healing
[2253.52 - 2258.72] is bloating a healing reaction so here
[2256.48 - 2262.16] let's go into this addy on youtube very
[2258.72 - 2265.44] good question and i want to be at
[2262.16 - 2265.44] service here okay
[2265.52 - 2269.68] here's how it goes okay
[2268.56 - 2271.52] right
[2269.68 - 2273.76] inside here
[2271.52 - 2275.44] is the food from the past
[2273.76 - 2278.24] it's the chocolate cake it's the donuts
[2275.44 - 2280.56] it's the cookies it's the additives it's
[2278.24 - 2283.60] all the rancid fats it's the the
[2280.56 - 2286.64] putrified proteins it's all of this junk
[2283.60 - 2289.28] in crud that lines the inside of your
[2286.64 - 2291.20] intestinal tract so addie this is
[2289.28 - 2293.04] important to know right
[2291.20 - 2294.88] okay
[2293.04 - 2296.56] all in here
[2294.88 - 2297.76] right when people have multiple
[2296.56 - 2299.20] sclerosis and i talked about this
[2297.76 - 2300.88] because i was the first to publish the
[2299.20 - 2303.12] cause of multiple sclerosis so it was
[2300.88 - 2304.80] the first to publish the true cause of
[2303.12 - 2307.04] multiple sclerosis and now harvard took
[2304.80 - 2309.28] my information
[2307.04 - 2312.24] didn't cite me and they took it seven
[2309.28 - 2313.44] years later illegally
[2312.24 - 2316.56] anyway
[2313.44 - 2318.96] so the whole point is right here okay
[2316.56 - 2321.12] that all this junk and garbage is
[2318.96 - 2323.28] sitting in here and sitting in here
[2321.12 - 2324.88] somebody who has multiple sclerosis is
[2323.28 - 2327.60] viral
[2324.88 - 2329.76] lots of metals lots of other toxins and
[2327.60 - 2332.00] poisons and a weakened digestive system
[2329.76 - 2334.32] with a lot of junk inside here i teach
[2332.00 - 2336.00] doctors this all the time
[2334.32 - 2338.16] when you're sending a banana down there
[2336.00 - 2339.84] the banana rolls
[2338.16 - 2341.44] i talk about this in the podcast if you
[2339.84 - 2344.16] guys haven't listened to the podcast
[2341.44 - 2348.16] please listen to it right
[2344.16 - 2349.76] so bananas roll and they roll through
[2348.16 - 2352.84] your gut
[2349.76 - 2357.84] and they're collecting all that crap
[2352.84 - 2359.52] toxins poisons petrified proteins gases
[2357.84 - 2360.88] and when you have too much of all that
[2359.52 - 2363.04] in there you're gonna bloat for a little
[2360.88 - 2365.60] bit because it's getting released but
[2363.04 - 2366.96] yet you're healing and that's one of the
[2365.60 - 2369.04] reasons why
[2366.96 - 2371.52] multiple sclerosis symptoms are getting
[2369.04 - 2373.60] at bay and minimizing something very
[2371.52 - 2375.76] important to know right
[2373.60 - 2376.72] elizabeth healthy liz says walk on water
[2375.76 - 2379.76] effect
[2376.72 - 2381.52] exactly the walk-on water effect dear
[2379.76 - 2383.44] apple man i love what you wrote and
[2381.52 - 2384.88] cleansed to heal about bananas walk-on
[2383.44 - 2387.60] water effect

[2387.60 - 2393.04] i can't keep up with it all all of soc's
[2390.48 - 2393.04] information
[2393.36 - 2396.80] i got a lot of it in here you know what
[2394.96 - 2398.88] happened was
[2396.80 - 2401.60] darlene listen to your podcast the
[2398.88 - 2403.68] ending wow cliffhanger yeah
[2401.60 - 2406.24] what happened is
[2403.68 - 2409.36] these books right here
[2406.24 - 2410.64] blew my mind so much
[2409.36 - 2412.56] that i
[2410.64 - 2413.68] because there's so much information in
[2412.56 - 2415.44] these books
[2413.68 - 2417.60] they're so packed these are the
[2415.44 - 2418.48] manuscripts right
[2417.60 - 2421.52] but
[2418.48 - 2422.56] these books the brainsaver books
[2421.52 - 2424.08] like
[2422.56 - 2425.20] i was a different person after these
[2424.08 - 2427.12] were done
[2425.20 - 2429.36] two books at the same time
[2427.12 - 2431.04] over 600 pages a piece
[2429.36 - 2432.56] uh packed with so much intricate
[2431.04 - 2435.12] information that i forgot about the
[2432.56 - 2436.08] walk-on water effect right and cleanse
[2435.12 - 2437.92] the heel
[2436.08 - 2439.84] because
[2437.92 - 2442.32] there's so much information that went in
[2439.84 - 2443.60] here and it was so hard to put to put
[2442.32 - 2444.64] these together
[2443.60 - 2446.64] that like
[2444.64 - 2448.40] it's i forget some of the other things
[2446.64 - 2449.92] so thank you for reminding me you will
[2448.40 - 2450.80] be blown away you guys when you see
[2449.92 - 2452.56] these
[2450.80 - 2454.32] when you have these in your hands i mean
[2452.56 - 2456.08] seriously
[2454.32 - 2458.72] like
[2456.08 - 2461.04] i'm afraid
[2458.72 - 2463.04] when those get out the industries are
[2461.04 - 2464.96] going to be so pissed at me
[2463.04 - 2466.72] because they're going to try to steal it
[2464.96 - 2469.12] like usually they always just steal the
[2466.72 - 2470.80] info from the medical medium books but
[2469.12 - 2472.00] when they see that when the industry
[2470.80 - 2473.20] looks at that
[2472.00 - 2475.04] because that's what they do they have a
[2473.20 - 2477.12] whole think tank they have a whole table
[2475.04 - 2478.88] of people around a board for them they
[2477.12 - 2482.08] they dissect medical medium stuff and
[2478.88 - 2484.32] information and then they thief it
[2482.08 - 2485.52] theft it away right that's what happened
[2484.32 - 2486.96] that's why
[2485.52 - 2488.48] all the different things over the years
[2486.96 - 2491.12] like the multiple sclerosis thing and so
[2488.48 - 2492.80] many other stuff like long c you know
[2491.12 - 2495.12] like long c
[2492.80 - 2496.64] long hall c medical medium did that
[2495.12 - 2498.72] first put that information out first you
[2496.64 - 2500.96] guys this is incredible listen i'm going
[2498.72 - 2503.36] to go live again
[2500.96 - 2505.68] and it's going to be in a little bit so
[2503.36 - 2507.12] i'm going to be on instagram
[2505.68 - 2508.48] and i'm going to be
[2507.12 - 2511.52] on tick tock

[2511.52 - 2515.12] three of those we're going to go live
[2513.04 - 2516.72] pretty soon and you know what come with
