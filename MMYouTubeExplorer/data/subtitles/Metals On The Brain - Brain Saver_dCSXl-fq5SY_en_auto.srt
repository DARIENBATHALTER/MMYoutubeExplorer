actions you want freedom and what

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,539
happens is when we get sick

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,340
and we don't know why we're sick we're

29
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,840

you get diagnosis ever diagnosis and

46
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,740

brain saver brain saver protocols right

56
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,140

this is a little disclaimer right here

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,039
when you get the books

60
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,899
just know that every line is packed with

61
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,540
information

62
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,940
every sentence there's no cookie cutter

63
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,420
fluffer butter Nutter or anything in

64
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,480
these books it is sentence to sentence

65
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,340
to paragraph of life-changing powerful

66
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,360
Advanced comprehensive detailed

67
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,520
information from above far Advanced from

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,379
anything signs of research has they're

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,540
going to be poaching the out of

70
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,160
these books science and research the

71
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,260
clinics all the clinics you know the

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,180
mayonnaise Clinic all of them they're

73
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,340
going to be poaching poaching taking

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,900
podcast doctors are going to be poaching

75
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,879
and taking from these very books it's

76
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,019
like they've done the other books and

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,700
that's what they're going to do they

78
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,840
don't have any original information of

79
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,400
their own they don't have any

80
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,560
information about the brain besides

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,840
telomere and the fact that

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,540
we're all genetically whatever and then

83
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,459
we'll Neuroscience but they don't know

84
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,200
why people are sick they don't know why

85
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,540
people are struggling and they're going

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,540
to poach the out of these books

87
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,420
because they're so ahead of science and

88
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,400
research so ahead of the time and that's

89
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,680
what we're up against and when you hold

90
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,060

Sentara

125

I kid you not I mean when I do those

126
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,160
brain shot therapies it hits me fast now

127
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,540
as I was telling you guys before in the

128
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,960
earlier live today I was trying to

129
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,780
forewarn you in alternative medicine

130
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,300
and conventional medicine it's not about

131
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,699
instant relief right and alternative

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,060
medicine it's not about instant relief

133
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,460
no one's expecting no one's anticipating

134
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,740
instant relief I'm trying to prepare you

135
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,240
first of all medical medium information

136
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,979
between the celery juice and all and

137
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,360
heavy metal detox smoothies and a lot a

138
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,000
lot of people get instant relief with

139
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,360
all the stuff but when it comes down to

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,180
the brain shot Therapies

141
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,240
we're talking about an instant relief

142
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,880
people have never ever experienced

143
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,259
before so I'm trying to prepare you so

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,360
what that means is you're going to be

145
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,340
caught off guard

146
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,840
that's the whole point Center's healing

147
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,400
says it literally feels like a happy

148
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,100
drug

149
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,380
you're it's because of the synergistic

150
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,240
blend that Spirit of compassion created

151
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,580
because only Spirit of compassion knew

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,979
about what to put with what just the

153
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,440
right amount just the right way so that

154
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:41,280
when you took the brain shot therapies

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,080
you get the relief and the thing is I'm

156
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,759
trying to tell you because you may not

157
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,240
be prepared for it it may not be

158
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,940
expecting that relief so when it comes

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,860
it catches you off guard which could be

160
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,539
fine but I'm just forewarning you when

161
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,860
you do the brain shot therapies that's

162
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,699
really important so I just want to go

163
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,479
over those a little a little bit now too

164
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,479
you guys

165
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,259
when you get your books

166
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,259
when you get your books

167
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,180
just know

168
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,699
it's a heavy box so if you got to take

169
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,860
one out at a time take one out at a time

170
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:19,500
all right because I see some of you guys

171
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,120
the books are coming the Box thrown on

172
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,600
your doorstep and you grab the box and

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,780
you're like what the heck is this what

174
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,960
is this and so you know when you unpack

175
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,919
them take about one at a time right I

176
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,539
mean

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,400
and

178
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,560
what's crazy about it is the information

179
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,500
is here in here

180
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,110
it's literally every single sentence and

181
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
every paragraph right

182
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,400
[Music]

183
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,400
so I'm in here

184
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Kim possibly said I am blown away at how

185
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,080
much you put in into these books you are

186

communicate that to you guys all right

193

and you know that's the whole thing and

195
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:27,120
there are 30 brain shot Therapies

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,860
seven brain shot therapy cleanses

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,780
it's important to know all on its own

198
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,460
right so I'm just going over a little

199
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,160
bit of this

200
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,380
so let me get to it now brain shot

201
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,880
therapy cleanses right you guys the

202
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,199
books are so big you can just keep on

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
going through and going through them

204
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,979
there's so much information in here it

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
just it's incredible I want to go over

206
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,720
the shifters the stabilizers and the

207
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,819
exposures one more time with you guys

208
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,020
that's an exciting moment I can't help

209
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,780
it

210
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,580
so here we are I'm just trying to bring

211
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,500
this right to the top

212
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,599
got my little postage notes on here I've

213
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,759
always done that you guys medical medium

214
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,740
brain shot therapy medical meaning brain

215
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,300
shot therapy offers instant relief while

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,060
you're working to fix problems on a

217
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,919
deeper level in your brain and nervous

218
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,380
system and body your brain and body have

219
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,460
a quick response to medicinals delivered

220
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,259
in a liquid form what I call a shot

221
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,460
designed to be highly absorbable in the

222
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,080
mouth and that's one of the things

223
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,000
things I want to tell you about the

224
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,099
stabilizers the brain shot therapies the

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,280
stabilizers the shifters and the

226
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,979
exposures these are designed to be

227
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,219
highly absorbable it's one of the

228
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,419
reasons why the relief comes which is

229
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,599
incredible it's not just the

230
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,039
phytochemical compounds mixed the right

231
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,159
way

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:47,220
right it's about the fact that it's so

233
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,560
absorbable but it's it's the blend of

234
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,380
the ingredients that make it even more

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,660
absorbent inside the mouth and then in

236
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,360
the bloodstream these brain shots

237
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,339
they're valuable healing components can

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,800
reach the brain quick so the thing about

239
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,420
the medical medium brain shot therapy

240
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,820
and you'll see when you get your book

241
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,140
and you look into this

242
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,339
one of the things that's really

243
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,600
important

244
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:15,540
is that these specially formulated shots

245
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,640
have the ability to reset and rewire the

246
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,399
brain one of the reasons why it gives

247
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,019
you that relief okay

248
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,459
and they're designed to be highly

249
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,160
absorbable in the mouth these brain

250
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,600
shots valuable healing components reach

251
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,459
the brain quick and I wanted to say that

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,100
again because that's the whole point so

253
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:35,700
when you do the brain shots

254
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,940
they reach the brain fast

255
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,060
that's one of the gifts of it that's one

256
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,700
of the powerhouses of it it reaches the

257
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,160
brain quick so important to know right

258
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,720
there that's a really critical piece of

259
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,399
it

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
and then these specially formulated

261
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,180
shots have the ability to reset and

262
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,279
rewire the brain another reason why you

263
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,940
get so much relief right there on its

264
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,140
own

265
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,140
it can shock out the patterns while at

266
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:08,040
the same time reducing triggers check

267
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,480
this out they can shock out patterns and

268
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,800
that's the thing so many people have

269
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,600
patterns

270
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,580
and the patterns can be some bad

271
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,320
patterns it's not your fault not judging

272
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,040
anybody no one should be judged on

273
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,740
patterns but these brain shot therapies

274
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,320
can shock out patterns

275
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,880
while reducing triggers that's a huge

276
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,440
point right there so many people are up

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,420
against so many triggers they're being

278
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,000
triggered all the time

279
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,519
and this can shock someone out of that

280
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,100
and actually stop the triggers medical

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,600
medium brain shot therapy is Uncharted

282
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,940
Territory so you guys it's Uncharted

283
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Territory just like all medical medium

284
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,480
information but man these brain shot

285
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,660
therapies is a whole other level these

286
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,420
are special configurations

287
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,660
synergistically combined just right to

288
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,820
crack the code of how the fruits herbs

289
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,620
leafy greens wild foods and vegetables

290
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,860
can work as medicine now here's what's

291
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,860
insane about the brain shot Therapies

292
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,260
it what happened with SOC and giving you

293
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,600
this information it was about cracking a

294
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,700
code

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,399
synergistically with combining the right

296
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,140
ingredients out of the wild Foods out of

297
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,880
the fruits out of the leafy greens out

298
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,519
of the vegetables and the herbs to

299
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,240
actually make it work so you get that

300
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
powerful relief

301
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,560
it just blows me away while Creative

302
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,060
Juice concoctions have their place in

303
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,440
human creativity in the kitchen should

304
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,060
be honored and that's true people can

305
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,380
throw a bunch of things together and

306
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,540
juice it or whatever there's a big

307
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,880
difference here it's not what you will

308
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,220
find here these brain shots

309
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:47,220
aren't just tasty Delights thrown

310
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,339
together for a fun experiment instead

311
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,740
these are gifted

312
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:54,240
combinations that literally will change

313
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,279
your life

314
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
the healing shots of medical medium

315
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,820
brain shot therapy are tools that come

316
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,079
from above

317
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,060
above

318
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,860
these brain shots are composed of

319
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,320
specific combinations of ingredients

320
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,480
working together

321
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,260
systematically for specific reasons that

322
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,480
only a source above could know

323
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,480
the relationships among these

324
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,680
ingredients are intricate and unknown to

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
anyone

326
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,279
hands down these are the greatest books

327
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,620
of health history

328
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,260
and science and research will never

329
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,420
touch these besides poaching from them

330
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,519
but they'll never be able to compete

331
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,320
with this for the future this is

332
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,320
literally the books for The Chronic Leo

333
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,920
until now this knowledge from above has

334
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,279
remained untapped so what that means is

335
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,320
I sat my ass in my office chair

336
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,240
and spirit of compassion said it's time

337
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,820
because this is what's happened in the

338
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,860
world whom I can only do so much I'm

339
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,300
only one person one messenger and spirit

340
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,820
of compassion said with just these brain

341
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,519
books have to be what they are they have

342
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,060
to be that volume is

343
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,500
they have to be that jacked up

344
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,320
they have to have that much information

345
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,940
healing information

346
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,940
and we have to get people better

347
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,920
so let's go over the brain shot therapy

348
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,459
list

349
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,079
Holly's Health says I did out my old

350
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,300
shot glass you got out your old shot

351
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,680
glasses that I used to use for tequila

352
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,480
laugh out loud that's actually great

353
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,480
though I'm glad you got those ones out

354
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,500
it's amazing Michelle says science

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,420
research needs the ego shifter indeed

356
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,220
they do

357
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,079
so they do

358
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,399
the brain shot therapy list I'll give

359
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,660
you a little rundown on that for a

360
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,760
second you guys good to see you guys

361
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,959
we're live right now brain shot therapy

362
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,480
list exposures pathogen exposure brain

363
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,100
shot so I'll just I'll just talk a

364
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,220
little bit about it too let me find the

365
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,019
exposure shots let's just do it pathogen

366
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,120
exposure you ready

367
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:03,480
you feel you've been around others who

368
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,060
could be contagious due to the Sea

369
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,800
the flu or mono

370
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,540
you're concerned about having shared

371
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,660
bodily fluids with another person

372
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,720
through shared glasses bottles food

373
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,399
utensils or plates

374
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,500
you're concerned about having shared

375
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,079
bodily fluids through public restrooms

376
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,060
or sexual activity

377
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,740
you believe you might have been exposed

378
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,420
to foodborne pathogens and you're

379
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,600
concerned about getting food poisoning

380
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,880
that's just a few powerful reasons why

381
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,860
the pathogen exposure right there is

382
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,720
there so then boom you said you think

383
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,160
you got any kind of exposure and it's

384
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,440
like boom you're sending down the

385
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,019
pathogen exposure now I'm going to talk

386
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,480
about toxic heavy metals on the brain

387
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:46,980
hence in the brain we're going to go

388
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,120
into that in a couple of minutes but I

389
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,279
just wanted to give you guys a quick

390
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,620
rundown on some of the different okay

391
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,019
mold exposure right there so the mold

392
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,579
exposure shots

393
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,920
now

394
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,199
I said this the other day if this is the

395
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,000
only reason why you buy it by the brain

396
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,380
books or get them free in the library

397
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,220
when they're in the library or whatever

398
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,260
if this is the only time you get the

399
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,519
brain you know only reason the mold

400
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,079
exposure then let it be the mold

401
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,779
exposure like

402
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,120
that alone is worth having these in your

403
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,339
hand to know this so the mold exposure

404
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,139
shop a helpful shot for any kind of mold

405
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,000
or mildew exposure including when you

406
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,620
have been visiting or living in a moldy

407
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
house or building

408
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,480
working in a moldy office or other

409
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,399
workplace

410
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,540
inhaling mold off another person's

411
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,920
clothing

412
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,420
people don't realize it but they're

413
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,040
inhaling mold on other people's clothing

414
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,360
you go into the store you're inhaling

415
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,699
all their mold and mildew off their

416
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,100
clothing from their home right

417
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,199
consuming water contain contaminated

418
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,720
with mildew or mold spores or eating

419
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,000
moldy food that's when you bring out the

420
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,800
mold exposure shot you're like boom you

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,500
bring that out boom you got your shot

422
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,880
glass boom you get that quick hit that

423
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,880
really boom you send it down

424
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,199
I know a lot of people are worried about

425
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,880
EMF and 5G it's like 5G what about 5G aw

426
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:08,040
what about 5G I've been hearing it right

427
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,740
for years

428
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,899
so I got an EMF and 5G exposure shot

429
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,540
which is really powerful on its own

430
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,760
try this shot

431
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,090
if you spend a lot of time on computers

432
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,800
and computerized devices hmm

433
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,260
[Applause]

434
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,940
spend a lot of time on computers and

435
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,500
computerized devices

436
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,480
so it's like yeah you better believe it

437
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,880
gonna be doing that shot

438
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
or if you live near a high voltage area

439
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
a lot of people live near high voltage

440
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,120
areas

441
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,820
spend time talking or texting on cell

442
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,279
phones like

443
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,339
[Music]

444
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,380
right traveling by plane this is a great

445
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,480
time to take this shot send this shot

446
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,459
glass down right

447
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,160
live or work close to others while

448
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:56,279
they're using devices spend your day

449
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,279
within several feet of a router

450
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,019
live near a cell tower

451
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,540
all those are the reasons right there

452
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,160
for the brain shot therapy EMF and 5G

453
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,839
exposure now we're going to be talking

454
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
about the toxic metal stuff let's go

455
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,900
into that right now I just wanted to

456
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,319
give you guys just a couple of the 30

457
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,799
shots now we have 30 shots brain shot

458
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:19,140
therapy we have seven brain shot therapy

459
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,660
cleanses actual cleanses you can do with

460
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,220
the shots which is really cool all on

461
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,500
its own

462
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,839
so that's really exciting

463
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,419
so we're in the medical medium heavy

464
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,559
metal detox now I talk about Metals

465
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,020
throughout the book in various places

466
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,000
and throughout the protocols book too so

467
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,980
right there so I'm in the brain saver

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
book you guys are getting some of your

469
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,980
books right you guys are excited that's

470
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,539
the protocols book let me just put that

471
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,980
out in the front a little bit so you can

472
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,960
see it

473
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,020
both these books equally powerful

474
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,900
equally packed with information equally

475
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,260
important both of them they were one

476
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,000
book and they had to become two they

477
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,580
were too big it was too big for one book

478
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,580
to publish to print way too big

479
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,220
medical medium heavy metal detox so I

480
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,460
want to just mention something about

481
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:10,860
here this is mind-blowing information

482
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,260
from above

483
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,820
now medical medium information is always

484
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,100
the most advanced with toxic heavy

485
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,140
metals and always has been in fact it

486
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,480
paved the way fact

487
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,120
it paved the way for the metal

488
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,460
information that we have now

489
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,980
including the dental stuff

490
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,600
I remember over 30 years ago being in a

491
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,280
dental conference is actually trying to

492
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,840
forewarn and tell people about those

493
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,480
Mercury amalgams

494
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,460
and I got the crap beat out of me for it

495
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,840
because no one was against the Mercury

496
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,580
malcolms they are filling people see

497
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,140
they do it now they even have that for

498
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,080
now for people's teeth they offer it but

499
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,740
the point is it was considered fine and

500
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,500
not harmful and I really took quite a uh

501
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,940
bashing for fighting for that one and

502
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,380
fighting for that one and traveling

503
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,220
around the country and fighting for that

504
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,320
one

505
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,940
a long time ago so that people aren't

506
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,120
getting Mercury fillings today in their

507
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,679
teeth so medical medium was a big part

508
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,039
of making sure that people aren't

509
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,980
getting still those fillings right so

510
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:13,440
but this is really incredible here this

511
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,200
information here so minus that

512
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,179
heavy metals that we inherit have aged

513
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,220
to them they're old

514
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:23,039
that statement alone is critical to know

515
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,840
that is a powerful statement already a

516
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
piece of information and that's just one

517
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,160
line

518
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,740
of this Advanced information one line

519
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,960
heavy metals that we inherit we inherit

520
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,580
in our family lines you guys passed down

521
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,280
from generation to generation to

522
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,620
generation right

523
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,539
they have aged to them

524
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,700
just think about that for a second

525
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,679
the metal in your system

526
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,600
is old

527
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,760
think about that

528
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,440
the metal in your brain

529
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,960
giving you your schizophrenia your

530
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,760
bipolar diagnosis your OCD your

531
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,740
depersonalization your depression your

532
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,559
anxiety and all the other stuff ADHD

533
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,260
your autism all these things we get the

534
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:06,660
medical medium first let the world know

535
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,679
causes those conditions those Metals so

536
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,179
when you hear it out there it was

537
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,580
poached here

538
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:14,160
heavy metals that we inherit have aged

539
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,960
to them they're old many times going

540
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,520
back as far as two thousand to three

541
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,140
thousand years so that means the toxic

542
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,960
heavy metals that are being passed down

543
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,780
from generation to generation

544
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,580
could be two to three thousand years old

545
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,760
in your family line going all the way

546
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,760
back

547
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,480
you'll be hearing this once these books

548
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,919
are out out you'll be hearing this

549
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,179
everywhere you'll hear it on podcast

550
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:39,179
you'll hear it in different places they

551
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,740
won't cite where it comes from

552
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,360
check this out

553
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,640
depending on what part of the world

554
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,780
someone's bloodline stems from too so

555
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,720
ready

556
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,520
older heavy metals also have a higher

557
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,860
oxidative rate than heavy metals from

558
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,480
newer exposures that's another sentence

559
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,740
in this book now take a look at both

560
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,720
these books

561
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,660
and the sizes of these books you guys

562
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,620
are getting them now in the mail okay

563
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,720
I read you two sentences

564
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:09,539
that are so far advanced in information

565
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,660
and mind-blowing

566
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:15,120
two sentences right check this out

567
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,340
older heavy metals also have a higher

568
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,020
oxidative rate than heavy metals from

569
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,580
newer exposures now first of all how

570
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,600
would we know they even oxidized well

571
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,640
that's medical medium information

572
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,500
originally but you you'll hear it out

573
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:29,220
there now

574
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,980
the older Metals oxidize faster they

575
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,539
have a higher rate of oxidation now that

576
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,799
means if you have these old inherited

577
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:40,320
Metals it's oxide oxidizing faster

578
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,120
send you into Alzheimer's dementia

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,320
depression anxiety whatever it's sending

580
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,919
you into all kinds of different

581
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,919
conditions

582
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,500
the aging process of toxic heavy metals

583
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,620
that were mined mined meaning mind from

584
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,500
the earth dug out of the earth machines

585
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,039
digging it out right people digging it

586
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,260
out throughout throughout time

587
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,220
the aging process of toxic heavy metals

588
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,720
that were mined many generations ago

589
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,100
started when the metals were removed

590
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,840
from the earth now this is something

591
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,520
science and research has no idea about

592
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,620
neither does any

593
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,659
professional or a podcast doctor or

594
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,299
whoever or somebody in Harvard or

595
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,640
whatever they don't know this they don't

596
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,100
know that when a toxic heavy metal was

597
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,740
removed from the earth a thousand years

598
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,840
ago 200 years ago 500 years ago it

599
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,400
already started oxidizing because oxygen

600
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,860
hit it

601
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,780
oxygen hit it

602
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,780
it was pulled out of the Earth where

603
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,820
there was no oxygen it was mined out of

604
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,860
the Earth

605
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,260
you see how mind-blowing this is when I

606
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,360
heard this from Spirit of compassion and

607
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,179
I was trying to get this in the books

608
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,980
like I was just like okay I gotta sit

609
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,480
back with that one for a second oh my

610
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,740
God I got to sit back with that one for

611
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,179
a second

612
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,179
think about how advanced it is

613
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,020
so when the toxic heavy metal was mined

614
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,340
out of the earth like Mercury a thousand

615
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:11,340
years ago it already started to oxidize

616
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,340
whoa

617
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,880
an oxidative countdown occurred so it

618
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,340
was a countdown then the countdown

619
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,740
started one Mississippi two Mississippi

620
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,960
three Mississippi four it started when

621
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,179
it was mined out of the Earth

622
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,940
a countdown occurred as Metals aged

623
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:33,419
those Metals became highly unstable when

624
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,360
they entered and sat inside human bodies

625
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,700
where metals are exposed to more oxygen

626
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,260
acids heat blood gases electricity

627
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,940
outside chemicals and more so when a

628
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,700
metal sits inside your body you guys

629
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,000
it's exposed to oxygen inside your body

630
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,820
acids heat blood gases electricity

631
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,919
inside your body

632
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,679
and more

633
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,720
so the older Metals pulled out of the

634
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,419
Earth the countdown of oxidation already

635
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,280
occurred then it got into the human body

636
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,559
that's the whole point it got into us

637
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,179
what do you think the Emperors of China

638
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,120
they were all poison to death because

639
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,820
the medicine in Chinese medicine culture

640
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,860
was Mercury

641
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,340
it was Mercury

642
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,260
everybody thinks it was this ingenious

643
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,780
natural

644
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:24,000
mushrooms it wasn't it was Mercury

645
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,880
that was their number one medicine up

646
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,159
until the 1800s was mercury in early

647
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,380
1900s actually

648
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,900
so in Chinese medicine culture it was

649
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,299
Mercury to give you that was that was

650
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,179
the whole point it was all Mercury and

651
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,400
so it gets passed on down but Mercury

652
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,400
was used in all cultures around the

653
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,620
world eventually as medicine so Mercury

654
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,120
got into all cultures around the world

655
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,059
right

656
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,340
it's important to know

657
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,600
new Metals differ greatly from old

658
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,820
metals

659
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,400
newer Metals differ greatly from old

660
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,960
Metals new metal exposure you guys the

661
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,760
new metal exposures you're getting all

662
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,679
the time like copper you want to drink

663
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,380
out of the copper cups the new fancy

664
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,880
copper cups now right the thermoses

665
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,440
whatever that are made out of copper

666
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:16,500
it's that's NuMe heavy metal exposure

667
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,820
newer Metals recently mined that's new

668
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,360
copper

669
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,740
that's new steel new copper new aluminum

670
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,440
whatever it's just all the different

671
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:27,240
Metals it's new newer Metals recently

672
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,980
mined and taken out of the Earth are

673
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,380
still highly toxic although they are

674
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,419
more stable here's the thing so newer

675
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,220
toxic heavy metal exposure still causes

676
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:37,200
problems and makes us sick but it's more

677
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,840
stable it's more stable than the older

678
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,880
metals making them less destructive is

679
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,039
older Metals but you have to get this

680
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,480
though check out this you guys I'm in

681
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,919
the brain saver books if you just got

682
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,779
here

683
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,779
lock down a copy when you can

684
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,960
foreign

685
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,820
newer Metals don't break down inside the

686
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,279
body as quickly it all depends on how

687
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,620
many generations the metals have been

688
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,440
passed down through and how much metal

689
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,179
is in each individual most people have a

690
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,980
mix of older metals and newer metals and

691
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,340
it brings us to another part here most

692
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,700
people who are sick depersonalization

693
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,140
depression 10 different ways to Sunday

694
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,960
anxiety and panic 10 different ways to

695
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,600
Sunday bipolar any other kind of of

696
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,940
diagnosis all of it

697
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,460
is metals

698
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,080
but a blend of newer and older the

699
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,240
newest metal exposure is when a child

700
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,279
gets something

701
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,460
can't read that in you can't read that

702
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,820
you guys I have to not read any of that

703
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,679
out here you gotta check out the book

704
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,480
most likely the Mercury and aluminum

705
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,279
were Unearthed in the last 50 to 70

706
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,559
years so here's the problem too so any

707
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:48,600
kind of new toxic heavy metal exposure

708
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,520
that you guys are getting it's been

709
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,260
mined out of the earth 50 to 70 years

710
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:57,020
ago

711
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,020
so 50 to 70 years ago

712
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:01,440
saved in storage and eventually

713
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,480
purchased by a medical industry or a

714
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,760
place inside a pharmaceutical or some

715
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,799
other kind of industry many medications

716
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,659
have toxic heavy metals in them and at

717
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,640
the same time

718
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,919
can't read you the rest of that

719
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,620
not on here

720
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,200
anyway bottom line you guys were talking

721
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,240
about Advanced information detailed

722
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,799
comprehensive just about metals that

723
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,559
nobody knows science of research or

724
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,380
anywhere else that's critical to know

725
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:30,600
and we're in it we're in the brain saver

726
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,700
book and brain saver protocols book you

727
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,799
guys and you guys if you get a chance if

728
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,840
you got your book whatever leave her you

729
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,400
know you've got both books I mean leave

730
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,960
a review if you get a chance on Amazon

731
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,360
that would be great

732
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,740
you beat out the trolls

733
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,320
that helps

734
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,900
both books would be amazing so if you do

735
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,179
leave a review if you like the book If

736
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,580
you like what's in it if you like the

737
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,460
recipes if you open the book and you see

738
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,200
some recipes you like leave a review

739
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,760
that would be great because it helps

740
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,220
other people find the book so they can

741
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,260
get the information and I got a new

742
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,400
podcast episode coming out tonight I

743
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,740
know a lot of you guys look forward to

744

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,100
so much information I can only scratch

784
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,659
the surface we're just talking about a

785
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,760
little bit about heavy metals inside the

786
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,919
brain we're talking about old Metals

787
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,840
versus newer metals and then people

788
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,820
having a combination and how it works

789
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,380
oxidation and all of that and that leads

790
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,240
obviously to so many conditions and

791
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,860
