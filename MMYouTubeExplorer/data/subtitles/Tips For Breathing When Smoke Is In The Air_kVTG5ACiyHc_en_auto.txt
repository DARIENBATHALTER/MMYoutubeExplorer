[0.04 - 5.20] when there's smoke in the air because of
[2.68 - 6.48] the LA fires right now things really bad
[5.20 - 8.20] for a lot of people I mean it's
[6.48 - 9.96] devastating I'm sure you guys have seen
[8.20 - 11.96] it out there people losing their homes
[9.96 - 15.08] people losing their Farms their
[11.96 - 18.00] businesses their family's homes their
[15.08 - 20.36] apartment buildings they're losing their
[18.00 - 22.48] places to live I just wanted to come on
[20.36 - 24.60] here just uh for a couple of tips number
[22.48 - 28.40] one one of the big things is because the
[24.60 - 30.32] air is so dry the Ash and the air it
[28.40 - 32.08] just cuts through it just gets into the
[30.32 - 33.52] lungs really easily and I think that's
[32.08 - 35.16] really hard for a lot of people one of
[33.52 - 37.52] the things that you can do is you can
[35.16 - 39.60] wear like an n95 mask it's going to help
[37.52 - 41.56] a little bit I mean it's obviously not
[39.60 - 43.48] going to protect you with flames and
[41.56 - 44.96] heavy heavy smoke so if you're exposed
[43.48 - 47.32] and you're out of your house and so
[44.96 - 49.08] forth one thing you can do is you take a
[47.32 - 51.04] towel like this and I've said this
[49.08 - 53.48] before with other fires over the years
[51.04 - 55.04] but you take a towel and you moisten it
[53.48 - 56.84] so this is really important right here
[55.04 - 59.36] you moisten it I'm squeezing out the
[56.84 - 61.96] water and you breathe through the towel
[59.36 - 63.76] a moist towel that's important you can
[61.96 - 65.68] actually make it as thin as you want you
[63.76 - 67.80] can double it up depending on how it
[65.68 - 69.56] feels you can do this too you can hold
[67.80 - 71.28] it just like this and you can put it
[69.56 - 73.36] over your face and you can breathe
[71.28 - 75.76] through it so what happens is the water
[73.36 - 78.56] is what catches a lot of the toxins a
[75.76 - 80.28] lot of that dust a lot of the ashes if
[78.56 - 82.40] you're moving around you get a couple of
[80.28 - 84.64] towels like that you keep them moist and
[82.40 - 86.16] damp now there's this packet I don't
[84.64 - 88.48] know if you've had this before it's a
[86.16 - 90.72] medical medium tool book right here okay
[88.48 - 92.36] environmental disaster a quality tools
[90.72 - 94.64] including some air cleaners that are the
[92.36 - 96.84] best ones other tools too
[94.64 - 99.00] supplementation you know for after the
[96.84 - 101.12] fact as well you get some place you're
[99.00 - 103.04] able or things start coming down got to
[101.12 - 104.32] build your immune system back up after
[103.04 - 105.40] getting everything cuz when it goes into
[104.32 - 106.80] the lungs and it goes into the
[105.40 - 108.48] bloodstream what happens with chronic
[106.80 - 110.36] illness when people have chronic illness
[108.48 - 112.88] it could be a trigger all those toxins
[110.36 - 114.56] all those poisons floating around Metals
[112.88 - 115.92] prayers go out to anyone you know my
[114.56 - 119.76] heart pours out to you you know I'm
[115.92 - 119.76] proud of you for all you're doing
