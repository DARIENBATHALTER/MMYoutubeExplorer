00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,800
you've heard of angels they're

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,239
everywhere but do you believe in angels

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,960
do you believe in their power because

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,760
they are out there and they are looking

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,040
out for people but what about accessing

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,080
Angels what about reaching out to them

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,640
communicating with angels and do you

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,920
know their names and what about angels

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,799
that don't have names did you think

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,280
about that because in this episode we're

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,320
going there we're going to explore and

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,280
talk about information from above that's

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,759
mindblowing about angels you're not even

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,520
aware of now for this one I would strap

29
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,520
yourself in and get ready because this

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,399
is information that's

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,399
Supernatural everybody is born with the

32
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,479
god-given right to reach out to Angels

33
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,640
whenever you need them now it may not

34
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,880
feel this way you may not feel angels

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,200
are out there so many people who have

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,240
struggles give up on thinking angels are

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,600
even there but they've witnessed your

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,840
struggle if you're somebody that went

39
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,119
through a hardship tragedy or just

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
anything that affected you Angels

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,640
witnessed it they're there as your

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,879
witness since the beginning of humankind

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,920
angels have been in existence they've

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,480
been here on Earth to look out for

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,200
people they've been here on Earth even

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,959
before Earth was here before the planet

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,400
itself was here they were getting ready

48
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,360
to service this planet they were getting

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,200
ready to serve people getting ready to

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,440
serve people here on this Earth but they

51
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,400
were already in existence serving people

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,000
civilizations on other planets like

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,239
Earth this planet was a new Battleground

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,120
for the angels and God's angels were

55
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:55,920
already helping prepare this planet when

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,840
it was forming already there to assist

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,400
God in the formation of this planet in

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,519
this solar system really early on and

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,040
why would Angels God's angels be there

60
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,799
to assist in the formation of this

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,640
planet because they had to be here

62
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,879
because of the falling angels the Fallen

63
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,879
ones as soon as the Earth was

64
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:22,200
inhabitable it was

65
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,319
ready there were the angels all set to

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,120
help

67
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,360
humankind now there are different Angels

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,760
they're not all the same there's angels

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,159
with different names there's different

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,920
varieties of angels we're going to be

71
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,280
talking about the group that's called

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,760
the unknown

73
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,640
angels in today's time present moment

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,040
right now in the Forefront of History

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
angels are working with us every day

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,360
there's a lot of Calamity on planet

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,959
Earth there's a lot of adversity there's

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,079
a lot of struggle there's a lot of

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,480
genocide still

80
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,959
today there's a lot of fights there's a

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,439
lot of Wars there's a lot of unjust

82
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,200
poisonous actions being taken out there

83
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,159
there's a lot of different things highly

84
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:12,560
toxic things on planet Earth that hurt

85
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,959
people in so many different ways and

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,000
then there's the everyday grind

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,000
accidents happening freak accidents

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,160
problems all kinds of different struggle

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,400
and Angels they're kept busy every

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,160
single day every single hour every

91
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,840
single minute there are m millions of

92
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,560
people on this planet that are praying

93
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,360
to the angels asking for help all the

94
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,039
time but who are they asking who are

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,759
they praying to most people pray to the

96
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:47,880
archangels they're asking for help from

97
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,560
the archangels two of the archangels are

98
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,880
asked upon and called upon all the time

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,840
Archangel Gabriel Archangel Michael they

100
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,840
get requests by the second all over the

101
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,560
globe and here's the crazy thing what

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,880
about another planet where humans live

103
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,400
who's watching over them who's servicing

104
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,680
those planets or another planet

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,720
Archangel Gabriel and Archangel Michael

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,759
now because most people pray to

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,039
archangels Michael and Gabriel they're

108
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:22,919
really busy it accounts for why a lot of

109
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,680
people don't get the help they need

110
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,000
they're stretched too thin and the

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,600
archangels Michael and Gabriel they got

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,639
other problems they have to fight evil

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,720
they have to battle Fallen Angels when

114
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,759
God calls upon them they have to go and

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,720
battle Fallen Angels at that moment

116
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,039
which takes them away from the job of

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,759
helping people individually but there's

118
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,759
a group of Angels the unknown angels and

119
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,039
they're working too really hard they're

120
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,720
working for God but you got a better

121
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,440
chance of getting one of them to help

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,840
you at difficult times and struggles

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,720
these powerful angels angs the unknown

124
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,479
angels are at a number of

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,000
144,000 there are exactly 144,000 of the

126
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,000
unknown Angels working for God this is a

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,560
holy number that God reveres because

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,360
they're unnamed they have no notoriety

129
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,960
they have no Acclaim their egos are

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,240
extremely low the unknown Angels carry

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,880
not a sword like Archangel Gabriel and

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,319
Archangel Michael and even their swords

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,199
are not exactly a sword like the kind of

134
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,840
sword that we see or we think about in

135
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:42,199
fighting in war but the unknown Angels

136
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,560
carry a light rod and this light Rod

137
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,160
wields a lot of power now the thing

138
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,880
about the light Rod is once you know

139
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,880
about this light Rod you can help access

140
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,599
it in your favor you can ask the unknown

141
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,960
angels to baptize you in a way to anoint

142
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,879
you to touch you with the light rod they

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,759
may do it anyway without you even

144
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,759
realizing it but asking them is really

145
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,080
helpful and beneficial because there's a

146
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,960
good chance when you're asking for it

147
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,680
asking for their help and the light Rod

148
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:18,440
to actually touch you they will do it

149
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,919
unknown Angels travel in numbers unlike

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,720
other angels that may travel alone

151
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,319
unknown Angels travel in groups and many

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,720
times they travel in threes so when

153
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,479
you're asking for help there's a good

154
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,199
chance three will come now unknown

155
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,720
Angels do travel alone periodically they

156
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,759
often do that now when it comes down to

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,000
Angels Angels tend to work with each

158
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,520
other when they're in battle so they'll

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,280
get together during a battle sometimes

160
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,560
they'll have to battle alone when it's

161
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
Darkness evil when it's against demons

162
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,240
when it's against Fallen Angels but in

163
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,599
this situation when you're asking for

164
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,000
help you're asking for these Holy Angels

165
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,720
the unknown angels

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,319
they travel in packs and they're there

167
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,360
to help you now if you hear stories out

168
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:10,560
there where someone sees an angel or

169
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,599
it's caught on a photograph and they see

170
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,360
the light they see Wings they see an

171
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:20,560
angel shape maybe they see it floating

172
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,319
above a car in a road maybe they see it

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,039
on a bridge but they caught it they

174
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,919
captured it it was miraculously captured

175
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,520
on a video or on film on a picture a

176
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,440
photograph

177
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,880
that light you see when you see the

178
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,519
angel in that photograph that's because

179
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,959
of the light Rod the carry or the sword

180
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,560
that light Rod is actually bringing

181
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,200
light into that photograph it's where

182
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,080
they get most of their light it's the

183
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,600
power coming off of that sword or that

184
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Rod that light Rod is also used to cast

185
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,519
light to shoot light send it in a

186
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,279
Direction so if an angel is trying to

187
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,120
get there as fast as they can can to

188
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,920
stop an overturned bus to save a bunch

189
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,320
of children or to save someone's life if

190
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,920
the Angels not there in time they'll try

191
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,360
to cast a light bolt from that Rod to

192
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,040
get there first to stop the tragedy or

193
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,680
to save at least one person on that bus

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,120
or in that car now there's a lot of bad

195
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,240
things happening on planet Earth all the

196
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,000
time and angels are working as hard as

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,000
they can now when things are happening

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
and they're bad Darkness can be involved

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,399
and it's that darkness that wants to

200
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,320
take the Angel's time away wants to trip

201
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,880
up the Angels keep the Angels busy so

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,519
the Angels can't take care of everybody

203
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,279
and that's why it's important to know

204
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,920
about the unknown Angels the best way to

205
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,480
reach the unknown Angels is saying their

206
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:57,440
name out loud asking for help out loud

207
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:01,360
praying for them out loud or directly to

208
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,880
God pray directly to God and ask God for

209
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,880
unknown angels to help ask God to send

210
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,440
unknown Angels or you can just go

211
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,079
straight to the unknown angels and ask

212
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:16,760
them saying it out of your mouth out

213
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,959
loud is critical because in our head we

214
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,800
just have a bunch of thoughts a lot of

215
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,480
people got a lot of different things

216
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,920
going on all kinds of different stress

217
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,440
different thoughts obsessive thoughts

218
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,279
information flying around and so when

219
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,880
you're asking for help and you're

220
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,519
praying to the unknown Angels it's

221
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,639
important to ask out loud you want them

222
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,200
to hear you there's a couple of things

223
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,560
going on one is the intention the

224
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,320
intention of really needing help it

225
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,279
comes out when you ask for it another

226
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,839
thing we have all these thoughts in our

227
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,920
head and we don't need the angels having

228
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,880
to sift through that it's like walking

229
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,040
down a street seeing a dumpster and then

230
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,480
jumping in it and sifting through it

231
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,160
looking for something in that dumpster

232
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,440
we have a lot of thoughts going on in

233
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,240
our heads a lot of it are junk thoughts

234
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,320
they don't need to be there but they're

235
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,720
there a lot of them are fed to us too

236
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,760
conditioning all from what we see what's

237
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,639
on social media other places so we have

238
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,560
all this jumbled stuff in there Angels

239
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,600
don't want to have to sip through that

240
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,040
they don't want to jump into a dumpster

241
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
in our heads and go through all that to

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,880
find that one thing you said which is I

243
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,880
need help and that one thing that you

244
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,480
said I need help with or the words I

245
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,200
need help in your mind can be wrapped

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,959
around a lot of baggage a lot of people

247
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,480
carry tremendous amounts of baggage and

248
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,360
that baggage contains a lot old

249
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,680
relationship breakups betrayal hurt harm

250
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,800
trust issues trust breakage anything

251
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,000
that happened that day information from

252
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
all your appointments information from

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,519
when you were growing up when you were

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,320
first born lots of baggage all wrapped

255
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,920
up into one it's in there and Angels

256
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,920
they have a hard time going through it

257
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,160
all and Angels they're really busy

258
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,360
they're not just saving human lives

259
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,040
they're saving animal lives so we need

260
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,360
to make it as easy as possible for them

261
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,000
to help us to hear us now if you're

262
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,800
somebody who can't get the words out for

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,680
some reason any reason maybe it's just

264
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,880
you're somebody who's very weak and

265
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,440
you're not feeling well your body feels

266
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,360
dry trained you're at a weak point in

267
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,079
your day your neurological system isn't

268
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,600
functioning good you're somebody that's

269
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,560
on mattress Island and you're struggling

270
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,360
or maybe it's the middle of the night

271
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,040
you just don't have the strength the

272
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,839
fortitude the energy to speak in that

273
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:52,240
moment then that's okay the angels will

274
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,600
know they'll know if you can't get that

275
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,639
out if you can't ask out loud they'll

276
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,360
know this they'll be there anyway

277
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,079
they'll know because a different

278
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,399
intention occurs when you can't get your

279
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,480
words out when you're struggling if

280
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,800
you're in a weakened state with your

281
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,560
condition of any kind and you want to so

282
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,959
bad you want to say something but you

283
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,560
can't and you can't even whisper it

284
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,519
they'll know this because it's a

285
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,600
different intention because thoughts all

286
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,160
kinds of different baggage all kinds of

287
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,320
different SC scrambled different

288
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,680
thoughts they don't take over when the

289
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,399
intention is to get out the world words

290
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,560
when you're in a weakened State and you

291
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:37,160
can't voice yourself so the angels will

292
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,720
hear your intention and they'll come and

293
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,880
help but if you have a voice and the

294
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,120
strength behind it it's best to ask out

295
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,639
loud almost everything in the world has

296
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:56,440
a name we like to know its name whatever

297
00:13:50,639 --> 00:14:01,040
it is a plant a piece of fruit a car a

298
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:03,560
street a state a shoe a handbag

299
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,759
everything needs a name that's how we

300
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,320
work down here every single animal every

301
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,959
insect has to have a name and we're used

302
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,440
to that names mean everything to

303
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:18,519
everybody if something doesn't have a

304
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,720
name we start losing faith or we lose

305
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,279
Faith instantly because it doesn't have

306
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,959
a name things need to have names for

307
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,880
people to believe in them even a

308
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,600
haunting a ghost people need to know the

309
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,680
name of the ghost a lot of people out

310
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,639
there they don't believe in ghosts so it

311
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,639
makes it harder for them to entrust that

312
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,519
that's a ghost in a house but when

313
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,519
someone puts a name to That Ghost it

314
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,680
becomes believable like that's old Mr

315
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,600
Smith that's who's walking around the

316
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:55,040
house Mr Smith used to live here Mr

317
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,279
Smith died he died in the bathroom 50

318
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,720
years ago somebody could see a ghost or

319
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,480
tell somebody that they saw a ghost but

320
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,440
when you put a name to That Ghost it's

321
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,680
believable that's the person that lived

322
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,519
here 50 years ago 100 years ago 200

323
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,560
years ago this is the case with angel

324
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,720
sightings a lot of psychics out there or

325
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,040
people that talk about angels they hear

326
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,800
this or maybe it's their own story they

327
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,320
saw an angel and they saw Archangel

328
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,000
Michael or Archangel Gabriel having a

329
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
name to that angel makes it more

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,759
believable so when someone sees an angel

331
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,160
and they could be seeing a real angel

332
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,399
Archangel Michael it helps because I saw

333
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,800
Archangel Michael and somebody's like

334
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,199
wow that's incredible and it makes it

335
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,360
more powerful the sighting everything

336
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,120
about it especially if someone thinks

337
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,880
that was definitely Archangel Michael

338
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,639
and maybe it was or it was another Angel

339
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,839
but it makes Faith grow even more you

340
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,399
have a name the unknown Angels don't

341
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:04,199
have a name there's 144,000 of them

342
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,079
which means there would be 144,000 names

343
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:10,519
so it takes a level of Faith to believe

344
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:14,800
in them it takes a level of

345
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,800
understanding it takes a level of I

346
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,079
believe in these

347
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,880
angels it takes Faith to believe in God

348
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,440
it takes Faith to believe in angels and

349
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,240
it takes Faith to believe in the unknown

350
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,839
Angels the unknown Angels respect faith

351
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,839
they have a tremendous respect for Faith

352
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
and if you don't have faith in them

353
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,560
that's okay they will still have respect

354
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,759
and they will still help even though

355
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,279
Angels work for God they have their own

356
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,079
free will they can make their own

357
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:52,040
decisions Angels don't take orders from

358
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,519
people Angels don't take direction from

359
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,920
people they choose to do what they want

360
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,319
to do and when you're humble Angels see

361
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,880
this they understand this when you're

362
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,679
somebody and you're asking for help and

363
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,720
you're humble and you've been through a

364
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,839
lot Angels see this and when you're

365
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,400

light it was floating over a

389
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,840
field I was looking out my window it was

390
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,240
early

391
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,120
morning I knew it was real it was shaped

392
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,080
like a

393
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,679
bird shaped like an eagle but everything

394
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,799
I felt in my bones and soul told me it

395
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,080
was an

396
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:50,400
angel tears dropping from my eyes I was

397
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,880
crying for no reason don't know

398
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,880
why I believe it all took me by

399
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,520
surprise the realization of what I saw

400
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:04,200
was more than I could ever

401
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:07,960
surmise I stepped outside the sun was

402
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,640
almost about to rise I walked over to

403
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,280
the spot where the angel was and I

404
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:19,799
suddenly felt warm and I felt very tall

405
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,960
even though the air had a chill and I

406
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:27,320
wasn't wearing a sweater or a

407
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,360
Shaw I prayed to God and said thank you

408
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,640
for sending me her

409
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:38,000
deep down inside I knew she was God's

410
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:40,480
best God's all I thanked the angel I

411
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,360
could still feel the Angel's light

412
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:48,200
around me in my farm I remembered what I

413
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:53,080
just saw the fields started to Glow as

414
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,840
the sun rose and I kneel down on the

415
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:01,080
ground because the message was clear I

416
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:04,840
was truly blessed by an angel of God

417
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,840
